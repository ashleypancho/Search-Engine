      <text xml:space="preserve">The feel of the stories about the Olympian gods is strangely like the feel of the stories about the gods of Ugarit. The stories from Ugarit are, roughly, seven hundred years earlier and the pantheon there is completely different. One striking fact is that in both cases the gods lived on the top of a high mountain to the north. 

It has been suggested that the catalog of ships in the Iliad is not myth, in the sense of being non-historical, but a historical survival from earlier days, perhaps as many as five centuries before. There is no implication that the list originally has anything to do with Troy.

{{recipesummary|Very Easy recipes|2|15 minutes|1}}
''Agnolotti in Brodo'' is a very simple and very delicious Italian soup containing ''agnolotti'', small ravioli filled most commonly with meat. This soup is delicious on a cold day when you haven't much time to devote to preparing a tasty meal. It is best served with some home made garlic bread and a healthy salad.

==Ingredients==

*250 grams (8-9 ounces) of ''agnolotti'' or other small ravioli-type pasta
*1/2 litre (2 cups) of chicken broth (canned or homemade) or 1/2 litre of water and 2 good-quality chicken stock cubes
*1/2 cup of single (light) cream
*1 pinch of ground black pepper (as much as can be held between finger and thumb)
*A handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley
*A dash (you decide how big or small!) of sweet sherry
*Fresh grated Parmesan cheese (Parmigiano-Reggiano) for garnish
==Procedure==

#Bring the chicken broth to a rolling boil. If using water and chicken stock cubes, bring the water to a boil, add the stock cubes and let dissolve.
#Add the ''agnolotti'' and cook according to the instructions on the package.
#Add the cream, freshly-ground black pepper, and chopped parsley about 2 minutes before the end of the cooking, and turn down the heat.
#Add the dash of sherry just before serving. If serving to children, dish out their portions first, then add the sherry for the grown-ups.

Let stand for a few minutes to marry the flavors, then serve, sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese...and enjoy.</text>

This salad is something that is easy to throw together, refreshing to eat and looks good. 
==Ingredients==
* 3 large ripe tomatoes, 
* 1 green pepper, 
* 1 smallish onion
* Handful of fresh coriander
* Ground cumin
* Salt and pepper
* Vinegar or lemon juice
==Procedure==
#Cut the tomatoes, pepper and onion into small dice

Now I am not a great liver lover but this really does taste good and probably would be ideal for feeding young children liver as long as you didn't tell them before hand what it was.

==Ingredients==
* 1/2 kg liver
* fresh garlic (optional)
* fresh coriander
* paprika
* salt &amp; pepper
* a little oil
==Procedure==
#Chop the liver into small cubes - 1cm square and put in a plastic container.
#Add a teaspoon of paprika, some salt and pepper, about a handful of fresh coriander finely chopped, two or three cloves of garlic finely chopped and a tablespoon of oil (you can use sunflower or olive oil).
#Mix this all together and leave for 30 minutes or more than make up your kebabs and grill to preferred level of &quot;charredness&quot;.

The kebabs with fresh bread and [[Cookbook:Moroccan Salad|Moroccan Salad]] make a nice meal.

In Morocco every home has a shallow round clay pot that is filled with charcoal and used to grill meat - and in many homes to cook the tagines on. Meat is put onto skewers and then held in a metal griller and cooked over the charcoal. As most Moroccan homes have an outdoor room (patio) everyone just sits round and eats as the meat comes off the grill. No need to wait for good weather to get the barbecue out!

==Unresectable disease==
*'''British MS01''' (2001 - 2006) - Active Symptom Control vs. ACS + MVP vs. ACS + vinorelbine
**Randomized, 3 arms. 409 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Arm 1) Active symptom control (steroids, analgesics, bronchodilators, palliative RT) vs. Arm 2) ASC + MVP (mitomycin 6 mg/m2, vinblastine 6mg/m2, cisplatin 50mg/m2) vs. Arm 3) ASC + vinorelbine 20 mg/m2
**'''2008''' PMID 18486741 -- &quot;Active symptom control with or without chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MS01): a multicentre randomised trial.&quot; (Muers MF, Lancet. 2008 May 17;371(9625):1685-94.)
***Outcome: median OS ASC 7.6 months vs. ASC + chemo 8.5 months (NS); subset trend benefit for vinorelbine 9.5 months (p=0.08)
***Toxicity: No difference
***Conclusion: Addition of MVP or vinorelbine to active symptom control offered no significant benefit

*'''EORTC-NCIC 08983''' (2000-2003) - Cisplatin vs. Cisplatin + Raltitrexed
**Randomized. 250 patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma. Arm 1) cisplatin 80 mg/m2 vs. Arm 2) cisplatin 80 mg/m2 + raltitrexed 3 mg/m2
**'''2005''' PMID 16192580 -- &quot;Randomized phase III study of cisplatin with or without raltitrexed in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma: an intergroup study of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Lung Cancer Group and the National Cancer Institute of Canada.&quot; (van Meerbeeck JP, J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 1;23(28):6881-9.)
***Outcome: median OS cisplatin 9 months vs. cisplatin + raltitrexed 11 months (SS); 1-year OS 40% vs. 46% (SS)
***Conclusion: Raltitrexed and cisplatin improves survival compared with cisplatin alone

*'''Pemetrexed Trial''' (1999-2001) - Cisplatin vs. Cisplatin + Pemetrexed
**Randomized. 456 patients with chemo-naive and inoperable mesothelioma. Arm 1) cisplatin 75 mg/m2 vs. Arm 2 cisplatin 75 mg/m2 + pemetrexed 500 mg/m2
***'''2003''' PMID 12860938 -- &quot;Phase III study of pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin versus cisplatin alone in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.&quot;  (Vogelzang NJ, J Clin Oncol. 2003 Jul 15;21(14):2636-44.)
***Outcome: median OS cisplatin 9 months vs cisplatin/pemetrexed 12 months (SS); time-to-progression 3.9 months vs. 5.7 months (SS)
***Conclusion: Pemetrexed + cisplatin + vitamin supplements resulted in superior outcome compared with cisplatin alone</text>

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Georgian uses its own alphabet, which has 33 letters. There are seven more letters, but they are no longer used, except in historical documents. 
The modern Georgian alphabet is called ''mkhedruli'' or მხედრული, which means &quot;military&quot;. This is because Georgian used to have another alphabet, called &quot;khutsuri&quot; or ხუცური, which means &quot;church&quot;. It is no longer used, except in the Georgian Orthodox Church.

==How many people speak this language?==
Approximately 4.1 million people speak Georgian.
==Where is this language spoken?==
Almost all Georgian speakers live in Georgia ([[Wikijunior:Europe/Georgia|click here]] to learn about Georgia). About 500,000 people abroad, mostly in [[Wikijunior:Europe/Turkey|Turkey]], Iran, [[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]], and the United States, also speak Georgian.

==What is the history of this language?==
==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
Not very many Georgian authors and poets are known throughout the world. Probably the closest person to an internationally recognized Georgian author is Joseph Stalin, or Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili (იოსებ სტალინი). He mostly wrote things about communism and the Soviet Union, which Georgia was a part of. 

Shota Rustaveli (შოთა რუსთაველი), Galaktion Tabidze (გალაკტიონ ტაბიძე), Mikheil Javakhishvili (მიხეილ ჯავახიშვილი), and Konstantine Gamsakhurdia (კონსტანტინე გამსახურდია) are some of the more famous Georgian authors.

==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==

Here is an extract of a poem:
გაზაფხულის საღამოა მშვიდი,
ხიდან ხეზე გადაფრინდა ჩიტი.

It sounds like this:
Gah-zap-khoo-lis sah-gah-moh-ah mshvee-dee,
Khee-dan kheh-zeh gah-dah-prin-dah chee-tee.

It means:
It's a tranquil spring evening,
A bird flew from one tree onto another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello! I am Electrobadger. I wanted to write myself an online reference to the C99 headers and functions.  Since this project existed, I decided to contribute to it.

=Header layout=
Below is my personal reference for the layout of the C99 header file pages.  The sub-headers here will be top-level headers on an header page.

----

==Macros==

==Functions==

==Notes==

----
I have decided to separate functions and macros, as it seemed to me that the difference is relevant.  `Macros' only includes those items that the C99 standard demands be a macro.  I consider the `Notes' section optional.

=Function layout=
And the layout for functions and macros declared in the headers:

----

==Syntax==

==Return values==

==Notes==

----

Here `Notes' probably shouldn't be optional.

If anyone has any ''better'' ideas, or an example which I should change the layout to, then let me know and we can discuss it.</text>

Sometimes, as SPT in CME, Chapter IX, points out, you find yourself
puzzling over how to differentiate something complicated like:

    &lt;math&gt; y = 3 (x^2 + 17)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The approach is to make the expression simpler
by abstracting away the detail. Let
''a'' be the polynomial:

     &lt;math&gt; a = x^2 + 17 &lt;/math&gt;
    
We can represent this using a sum of terms:

Now, ''y'' can be rewritten as:

  &lt;math&gt; y = 3 a^2 &lt;/math&gt;

To find the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x'',
we use the ''chain rule'':

    &lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{da} * \frac{da}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, the differential of ''y'' with respect to ''x''
is equal to the differential of (the rewritten) ''y'' with respect
to (the new) ''a'' multiplied by the differential of (the new) ''a'' with
respect to ''x''.

Programmatically, we have:

    var a = term(1,:x,2) plus term(17,:x,0);
    var y = term(3,:a,2);

    var dy/dx = y . diff(:a) times  a . diff(:x);

Looking at what ''dy/dx'' represents, we have:

    sway&gt; a . toString();
    STRING: x^2 + 17
    sway&gt; y . toString();
    STRING: 3x^2
    sway&gt; dy/dx . toString();
    STRING: 6a * 2x

Doing the final substitution by hand (&lt;math&gt;a = x^2 + 17&lt;/math&gt;),
we get the final answer for ''dx/dy'':
 
     dy/dx = 6 * (x^2 + 17) * 2x
           = (6x^2 + 102) * 2x
           = 12x^3 + 204x

==Implementing the chain rule==

It would be nice to have the chain rule substitution step
automatically done
for us, but doing so requires a bit of work,
both conceptually and programmatically.
We begin by extending the idea of abstracting
the variable of a term. Recall that, at first, we hard-wired
the term variable as ''x''. Next, we allowed the caller of the
''term'' constructor to pass in the independent variable as
a Sway symbol. The next step in the abstraction is to allow
the term variable to be a term (or sum of terms or whatever)
itself. If we did so, then a term's ''diff'' method would become
the chain rule:

    function diff(wrtv)
        {
        term(a * n,iv,n - 1) times iv . diff(wrtv);
        }

Obviously, the independent variable ''iv'' can no longer 
be a symbol, but must be instead an object with a ''diff'' method. So, to
represent a term of the form:

    &lt;math&gt; a x^b &lt;/math&gt;

we would need to use an object to represent the variable ''x''.
The constructor for such a variable object would look similar
to term and plus constructors. That is, it must have ''value'',
''toString'', and ''diff'' methods&lt;ref&gt;
This is the heart of the object-oriented approach to programming:
related objects have the same methods,
but the methods are customized for the particular object.
&lt;/ref&gt;:

    function variable(name)
        {
        function value(x) { x; }
        function toString() { &quot;&quot; + name; }
        function diff(wrtv)
            {
            if (wrtv == name)
                {
                constant(1);
                }
            else
                {
                constant(0);
                }
            }
        this;
        }

The rule for finding the derivative of a simple variable is: if 
the with-respect-to variable matches, the result is one. If not,
the result is zero.
We will use constants to represent the numbers zero and one;
in this way, every item in our system, including numbers,
has ''toString'', ''value'', and
''diff'' methods.

To make our lives simpler, we can add the following logic to the
body of the ''term'' constructor. If a symbol is passed in as
the independent variable, we will convert it into a ''variable''
object.&lt;ref&gt;
This little trick illustrates an important principle in the design
of the computer programs: do as much for the user of your code
as possible. We could force the user to pass in a variable
object or we could allow the user to pass in a symbol, as before,
and do the work ourselves.
&lt;/ref&gt;
In this way, we can pass in a symbol as before.
Here is a mock-up of the new term constructor:

    function term(a,iv,n)
        {
        function value(x) { ... }
        function toString() { ... }
        function diff(wrtv)
            {
            if (n == 0)
                {
                constant(0);
                }
            else
                {
                term(a * n,iv,n - 1) times iv . diff(wrtv);
                }
            }
        
        if (iv is :SYMBOL, iv = variable(iv));
        this;
        }

We will also need to modify term's ''toString'' method to call ''iv'''s 
visualization. Here is the new non-simplifying version:

    function toString()
        {
        &quot;&quot; + a + iv . toString() + &quot;^&quot; + n;
        }

Let's test our modified system:

    var t = term(4,:x,3);
    var t' = t . diff(:x);

    sway&gt; t . toString();
    STRING: 4x^3
    sway&gt; t . iv;
    OBJECT: &lt;OBJECT 1958&gt;
    sway&gt; t' . toString();
    STRING: 12x^2

It seems to be working so far for simple variables. Now let's
try our original problem:

    &lt;math&gt; y = 3 (x^2 + 17)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

First, we make our polynomial:

    var a = term(1,:x,2) plus term(17,:x,0);
    var y = term(3,a,2);                     // not :a 

Now, we visualize it:

    sway&gt; y . toString();
    STRING: 31x^2 + 17x^0^2

Ouch! What did we do wrong? We need to parenthesize the
visualization of ''iv'':

    function toString()
        {
        &quot;&quot; + a + &quot;(&quot; + iv . toString() + &quot;)&quot; +  &quot;^&quot; + n;
        }

Remaking ''a'' and ''y'' with term's new visualization
yields:

    var a = term(1,:x,2) plus term(17,:x,0);
    var y = term(3,a,2);

    sway&gt; y . toString();
    STRING: 3(1x^2 + 17x^0)^2

If you use a simplifying ''toString'' method for terms,
you should get:

    3(x^2 + 17)^2

exactly as desired! Now let's differentiate ''y'' (you will need
your ''times'' constructor up and running):

    var y' = y . diff();

    sway&gt; y' . toString();
    STRING: 6(x^2 + 17) * 2x

Nice!

We still have two little problems.
The first is that the above result is not in its 
simplest form. Unfortunately, producing the simplest form
is rather a complex process (compounded by the fact that
is is not always clear which form is the simplest). So
we will stop at this point and be happy.

The other little problem occurs when we visualize
''a'':

    sway&gt; a . toString();
    STRING: (x)^2 + 17

We've gone overboard with the parentheses. Clearly, when
the independent variable is a complex object, we want to
use parens. When it is a simple variable, however, we should
eschew parens. This task is left as an exercise.
                
==Questions==

'''1'''.
Explain why the ''diff'' method for terms no longer needs to test whether or not the with-respect-to variable matches the independent variable.

'''2'''.
Implement the ''one'' function.

'''3'''.
Modify the simplifying ''toString'' method for terms to print out
parentheses only when the independent variable is complex and ether
the coefficient or the exponent is not equal to one. ''Hint'': Create
a ''term'' method that adds parentheses around ''iv'''s visualization if it
is complex but simply returns ''iv'''s visualization if it is not. Call
this method from ''toString'' where appropriate.

The &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; macro returns a &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;, ''i.e.'' no value.

=Notes=
The behaviour of the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; macro depends on the value of the &lt;code&gt;NDEBUG&lt;/code&gt; macro.  See [[C Programming/C99 Reference/assert.h#Notes|assert.h]] for more details.

If &lt;code&gt;NDEBUG&lt;/code&gt; is defined then the macro &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt;, regardless of argument, is defined as

&lt;code&gt;
 #define assert(expression)        ((void) 0)
&lt;/code&gt;

If &lt;code&gt;NDEBUG&lt;/code&gt; is not defined the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; macro acts as a diagnostic test.  If the &lt;code&gt;expression&lt;/code&gt; argument of the macro is false (see [[C Programming/Control#Conditionals|C Programming/Control]]), then the macro expands to a statement which writes the text of the argument, the present file name, line number and function name to the standard error stream.  Finally the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; macro calls the &lt;code&gt;[[C Programming/C99 Reference/abort()|abort()]]&lt;/code&gt; function.

Each time the &lt;code&gt;assert.h&lt;/code&gt; header is included the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; macro is redefined depending on the value of &lt;code&gt;NDEBUG&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Sliding Axles &amp; Slider Repair =

First presented are techniques for sliding trailer tandem axles under normal circumstances, second are techniques when normal techniques don't work, third are field repairs that can be made.

Calculating weight redistribution, legal weight limits are not discussed in this chapter.

The reasons one might want to slide the trailer axles are:
* to balance the weight of the rig for operational or legal requirements.  Operationally it is best to have nearly equal weight on the drive axles and the trailer axles.  This makes braking and control easier.  If too much of the weight is carried by the trailer, the drive axles will not adhere to the road properly.  This can result in the drives being lifted off the road surface and loss of control.
* to meet king pin to axle requirements
* to aid maneuvering (typically all the way back for docking in a tight space or all the way forward for making tight road turns)
* as a safety precaution for unloading (this is to prevent forklifts from  causing the tail to drop, which is especially important if the tractor is not present to act as a counter weight)

=== Standard Techniques for sliding trailer tandem axles ===

The optimal way to slide trailer axles depends on the equipment available and if a helper is available.  The following will be described:
*without help
**trailer brake available
**trailer brake not available
*with help
**trailer brake available
**trailer brake not available

==== Without help and trailer brake available ====
Some tractors have the ability to apply the service brakes on the trailer separately from the tractor brakes.  The trailer service brake is always preferred as it applies more brake power than the spring brakes that are activated by the trailer brake button found on all tractors.

# stop the rig
# set only the tractor parking brake (you may need to hold the trailer button in while pulling the tractor button)
# make sure the transmission is in neutral
# alight from the tractor
# disengage the slider pins (the techniques for doing this on the various types of mechanisms is treated bellow)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What the Effect Looks Like ==
The effect will produce something like this:&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:shine01.png]]

== Design the Button ==
[[Image:shine02.png]]&lt;br /&gt;
For this button I selected all, then did Image&gt;Select&gt;Rounded Rectangle, with a radius of 50. I filled it with red, then I selected the border and filled with a darker red.

== Add a New Layer for the Shine ==
Create a new layer (call it shine or something similar), then select the whole region of your button (If you created it on a new layer you can right click on the layer and select “Alpha to Selection”), next shrink the selection (Image&gt;Select&gt;Shrink), how much you want to shrink it depends on the size of the image, for mine I used 6px, then fill the selection with white.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:shine03.png]]

Now, you have a big ugly white spot in your image, how will that be turned into a shine? First, turn the layer transparency down to about 80%, this is found in the layers dialogue&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:shine04.png]]

== Turn the Ugly Spot into a Shine ==
First, add a layer mask, and select fill with black. (Full transparency).&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:shine05.png]]

Then go to the gradient tool and select linear white to black gradient, (make sure you are editing the layer mask-- it should have a white border around it in the layers dialogue), draw a gradient from wherever you want the shine to start (Top-left corner in the example) to about the middle, feel free to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;
[[Image:shine06.png]]

== Add Text/Drawings to Your Button ==
Once you are done you may add another layer for drawing on, or put text on, for the example I added the text “Button Text”.&lt;br /&gt;

==Antioxidants==
*'''Naval Medical Center, San Diego; 2008''' PMID 18505970 -- &quot;Should supplemental antioxidant administration be avoided during chemotherapy and radiation therapy?&quot; (Lawenda BD, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2008 Jun 4;100(11):773-83. Epub 2008 May 27.)
**Literature review
**Conclusion: Antioxidants during chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be discouraged, because of the possibility of tumor protection and reduced survival</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">#Drive the vehicle on to a set of ramps.
#Engage the parking brake. Place blocks behind the rear wheels.
#Place jack stands in a suitable location under the ramped vehicle. This minimizes another risk with ramps, that they can collapse. Possible locations for jack stands are the jack seam.
#Place drain pan under the vehicle and remove the drain plug with a 17 mm socket.
#Place the draining pan so that it collects the oil draining from the pan as well as covering the area under the filter.
#Remove the filter. Located at the back of the engine about a 30cm above the exhaust pipe. 
#Lubricate the new filter before installation
#Install the drain plug.
#Remove the filler plug. Add the recommended amount of oil. This is 4.3 litres () of 5W-20. Secure the filler plug. Check the oil level with the dipstick. It should be close to right.
#Start the vehicle, remove it from the ramps, and place it on a level surface.
#Check the oil level and add as required.

Also, your permission error should go away after you've had an account for a few days, I think they put that in there so that spambots don't just create a billion accounts and upload random stuff. If it doesn't work after a week or so let me or someone else (at the [[WB:RR|reading room]]) know. The reading room is generally a better place to ask that sort of thing than an article talk page since a lot of people watch that on a regular basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Plants==
{{TOCright}}
This is a list of all '''fictional plants''' that appear in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth writings. Under the ''Species'' heading, only those that differ from real-world plants are included.

In [[w:Quenya|Quenya]], an Elven tongue devised by Tolkien, the general term for plants as distinct from animals was '''''olvar'''''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Silmarillion'', Ch. 2 &quot;Of Aulë and Yavanna&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species===
====Aeglos====
A kind of shrub that grew around the hill of Amon Rûdh in Beleriand, described in the ''Narn i Chîn Húrin'' as &quot;long-legged&quot;, sweet-smelling and creating gloomy &quot;aisles&quot; beneath the roof of branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Narn&quot;&gt;''Unfinished Tales'', &quot;Narn i Hîn Húrin&quot;: &quot;Of Mím the Dwarf&quot; and notes 14, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Tolkien stated that ''aeglos'' was &quot;like furze (gorse), but larger, and with white flowers&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Narn&quot;/&gt; he also compared it with the yellow-flowered gorse bushes said in ''The Lord of the Rings'' to have grown in Ithilien.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Towers'', IV 7 &quot;Journey to the Cross-roads&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The name, shared by the spear of Gil-galad, means 'snow-thorn' in Sindarin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stems AYAK-, EK-, GOLÓS-.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alfirin====
The name '''''alfirin''''', apparently meaning 'immortal' in Sindarin,&lt;ref name=&quot;alfirin&quot;&gt;''The Etymologies'', stems LA- and PHIR-.&lt;/ref&gt; was used by Tolkien twice. In ''The Lord of the Rings'', Legolas sang about &quot;the golden bells ... of mallos and alfirin&quot; that grew in the land of Lebennin in Gondor;&lt;ref name=&quot;LD&quot;&gt;''The Return of the King'', V 9 &quot;The Last Debate&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; while in the story of ''Cirion and Eorl'' it is stated that &quot;the white flowers of ''alfirin''&quot; bloomed upon the mound of Elendil on Amon Anwar.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;&gt;''Unfinished Tales'': &quot;Cirion and Eorl&quot;, (iii) and note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Tolkien surmised that in the second case the flower should be equated with the ''simbelmynë'', which was also white-coloured and never-fading, and that in Legolas's song the reference is to a different plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt;

====Athelas====
A healing herb, called '''''asëa aranion''''' in Quenya and '''''athelas''''' in Sindarin, translated to English as '''kingsfoil'''.

According to ''The Lord of the Rings'', it was first brought to Middle-earth by Númenóreans, but by the end of the Third Age the knowledge of its healing properties was lost among all but the Rangers of the North. In the folklore of Gondor, it was especially powerful in the hands of the King, perhaps because of the Elvish heritage of the royal House of Elendil. ''Athelas'' was used by Aragorn three times in the narrative: first, to heal the wound of Frodo Baggins done by the Witch-king with a Morgul-blade,&lt;ref name=&quot;FF&quot;&gt;''The Fellowship of the Ring'', I 12 &quot;Flight to the Ford&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;, secondly after the Fellowship's escape from Moria, where the wounds of Sam and Frodo are tended and lastly after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. This time he secretly entered Minas Tirith upon his return to Gondor to heal those touched by the Black Breath, namely Éowyn, Faramir and Merry, an act that enhanced his reputation and strengthened his claim to the crown.

''Athelas'' was also used by Huan and Lúthien to heal wounded Beren early in the ''Lay of Leithian'' (compended in ''The Silmarillion''). This contradicts the statements in ''The Lord of the Rings'' of ''athelas'' being brought to Middle-earth by the Númenóreans, so either the conception was changed by Tolkien in later versions of his legendarium, or the herb grew in Beleriand before it was destroyed, and then was brought ''back'' by Númenóreans in the Second Age.

''Kingsfoil'' is also mentioned in Ursula K. Le Guin's ''A Wizard of Earthsea'', as one of the herbs in the witch of Gont's hut. It is also the name of a band based in York County, Pennsylvania.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.kingsfoil.com]&lt;/sup&gt;

====Culumalda====
A tree that grew at the Field of Cormallen in North Ithilien of Gondor. The name translates from Quenya as 'golden-red tree', referring to the colour of the tree's foliage.&lt;ref name=&quot;culumalda&quot;&gt;''The Silmarillion'': Appendix, entry ''kul-''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Culumalda'' was not mentioned by J. R. R. Tolkien himself in published writings, it only appears in Christopher Tolkien's Appendix to the published ''Silmarillion''.&lt;ref name=&quot;culumalda&quot;/&gt;

David Day in his ''A Tolkien Bestiary'' conjectured that the elves found ''culumalda'' reminiscent of the Laurelin, and that it was thin and tall.&lt;ref&gt;David Day: ''A Tolkien Bestiary'', p. 54. ISBN 0-7537-0459-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Elanor====
A small star-shaped yellow flower, whose name means 'sun-star' in Sindarin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stems EL-, ANÁR-.&lt;/ref&gt; It grew abundantly on the Cerin Amroth mound in Lothlórien together with ''niphredil'',&lt;ref name=&quot;L&quot;&gt;''The Fellowhip of the Ring'', II 6 &quot;Lothlórien&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and also in Tol Eressëa.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE&quot;&gt;''Unfinished Tales'': &quot;Aldarion and Erendis&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; On Frodo Baggins's suggestion, Samwise Gamgee named his daughter, Elanor the Fair, after this flower.

====Lairelossë====
An evergreen and fragrant tree that grew in the province of Nísimaldar in Númenor, where it was brought from Tol Eressëa by the Elves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;&gt;''Unfinished Tales'': &quot;A Description of Númenor&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The name can be translated from Quenya as 'summer white-blossom'.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppD&quot;&gt;''The Return of the King'', Appendix D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stem LOT(H).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laurinquë====
A tree with &quot;long-hanging clusters of yellow flowers&quot; that grew in the province of Hyarrostar in Númenor, where it was brought from Tol Eressëa by the Elves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt; The name is derived from Quenya ''laurë'' 'golden'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stem LÁWAR-.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lebethron====
A species of tree that grew in Gondor. The casket in which the Crown of Gondor was kept after the death of Eärnur and before the coming of Elessar was made of ''lebethron'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Return of the King'', &quot;The Steward and the King&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the walking-staves presented by Faramir to Frodo and Sam in Ithilien.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Towers'', &quot;Journey to the Crossroads&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lissuin====
A sweet-smelling flower from Tol Eressëa, &quot;whose fragrance brings heart's ease.&quot; Some of these were brought by the Elves to Númenor for the adornment of a feast following Aldarion and Erendis's wedding.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE&quot;/&gt; The first part of the name apparently derives from Quenya ''lis'' 'honey',&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stem LIS-.&lt;/ref&gt; being a reference to the tree's odour.

====Mallorn====

A huge Elven tree that grew in Tol Eressëa, Númenor and in Lothlórien. '''''Mallorn''''' (pl. ''mellyrn'') is the Sindarin name of the plant, its Quenya equivalent being '''''malinornë'''''; both mean 'golden tree' and refer to the leaves' colour in autumn and winter.&lt;ref&gt;The Index to ''The Return of the King''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stems SMAL-, ÓR-NI-.&lt;/ref&gt; The tree is most fully described in ''Unfinished Tales'':

{{cquote|Its bark was silver and smooth, and its boughs somewhat upswept after the manner of the beech; but it never grew save with a single trunk. Its leaves, like those of the beech but greater, were pale green above and beneath were silver, glistering in the sun; in the autumn they did not fall, but turned to pale gold. In the spring it bore golden blossom in clusters like a cherry, which bloomed on during the summer; and as soon as the flowers opened the leaves fell, so that through spring and summer a grove of ''malinorni'' was carpeted and roofed with gold, but its pillars were of grey silver. Its fruit was a nut with a silver shale.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt;}}

According to the same text, ''mellyrn'' originally grew upon the isle of Tol Eressëa (and likely in Valinor also), where they were accounted to be exceptionally tall. Early in the Second Age seeds were brought by the Elves to Númenor; there the trees grew only in the westward province Nísimaldar, &quot;reaching after five centuries a height scarce less than in Eressëa itself&quot;. Later King Tar-Aldarion presented some seeds to Gil-galad, Lord of Lindon, the westmost realm in Middle-earth; but these did not take root in his kingdom, so Gil-galad gave them instead to Galadriel. &quot;Under her power&quot; the ''mellyrn'' had sprouted in the land of Lothlórien, but &quot;they did not reach the height or girth of the groves of Númenor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt;

Tolkien stated that the original name of Lothlórien, Lórinand or the &quot;Valley of Gold&quot;, was chosen by Galadriel with a reference to the ''mellyrn'' trees;&lt;ref&gt;''Unfinished Tales'', note 5 to &quot;History of Galadriel and Celeborn&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lord of the Rings'' adds that the trees became the most famous property of the realm among other peoples of Middle-earth, and the land was often known as the &quot;Golden Wood&quot;. The Elves of Lothlórien after some time began to build their houses high upon this trees, constructing around the trunk a &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;flet&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, supported by the branches. Their main city Caras Galadhon was entirely built upon the ''mellyrn''.&lt;ref name=&quot;L&quot;/&gt; They were also accustomed to wrap ''lembas'' in ''mallorn''-leaves.

The only ''mallorn'' in Middle-earth outside Lothlórien was the Party Tree in the Shire, which had sprouted out of the seed that Galadriel presented to Samwise Gamgee. Tolkien seems to imply that it ''did'' sprout only because of Galadriel's the &quot;magic&quot; soil that Sam had added at that spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&quot;&gt;''The Return of the King'', VI 9 &quot;The Grey Havens&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his drafts for ''Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin'', Tolkien proposed that ''mallorn''-trees grew in city of Gondolin in the First Age; however, Christopher Tolkien noted that later writings &quot;do not suggest, though they do not deny, that [''mellyrn''] flourished in Gondolin in the Elder Days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuor&quot;/&gt;

====Mallos====
This flower appears only once in Tolkien's writings. In ''The Lord of the Rings'' Legolas sang of it thus:
:''And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin''
:''In the green fields of Lebennin.''&lt;ref name=&quot;LD&quot;/&gt;
Its name can be interpreted in Sindarin as 'yellow-snow'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stems SMAL-, GOLÓS-.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nessamelda====
An evergreen and fragrant tree that grew in the province of Nísimaldar in Númenor, where it was brought from Tol Eressëa by the Elves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt; The name apparently means 'beloved of Nessa' in Quenya.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stem MEL-.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Niphredil====
A white flower, whose name means 'snowdrop' in Sindarin.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stem NIK-W-.&lt;/ref&gt; It first bloomed in the forest of Neldoreth in Doriath at the birth of Lúthien. Together with ''elanor'', it also grew in Lothlórien upon Cerin Amroth.&lt;ref name=&quot;L&quot;/&gt;

====Oiolairë====
A tree that grew in Númenor, where it was brought from Tol Eressëa by the Elves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt; It had &quot;ever-green, glossy and fragrant&quot; leaves and throve upon sea-air; its bough was believed not to wither &quot;so long as it was washed with the [sea]-spray&quot;, which is the source of its name ('ever-summer' in Quenya).&lt;ref name=&quot;AE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AppD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uilos&quot;/&gt; The Elves of Eressëa used to set a branch of ''oiolairë'' upon their ships &quot;in token of friendship with Ossë and Uinen&quot;, and they passed this tradition to the Númenóreans. When a ship of the latter departed into a long journey to Middle-earth, a woman of captain's kin was accustomed to &quot;set upon the vessel's prow the Green Bough of Return&quot; cut from an ''oiolairë'' tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE&quot;/&gt;

This bough forms an important plot detail of the story ''Aldarion and Erendis''. According to the narrative, King Tar-Meneldur at one point refused to bless his son Aldarion's sailing to Middle-earth and forbid his kin to set ''oiolairë'' upon the ship; and Erendis won Aldarion's love by doing this instead. She set it several times later, though her love for Aldarion gradually lessened; but after a bough became frozen during one journey, Erendis disapproved completely of Aldarion's journeys. Another woman used to bless his ships for some time, until Aldarion forsook the tradition and instead placed upon the prow an image of an eagle presented to him by Círdan; by that time he had finally breached with Erendis.&lt;ref name=&quot;AE&quot;/&gt;

====Pipe-weed====

A variety probably of Nicotiana&lt;ref&gt;{The Fellowship of The Ring, Prologue: &quot;Concerning Pipe-weed&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the Hobbits and used by Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers of the North for smoking.

It is also called ''Halflings' Leaf''; Among the Dúnedain it is known as ''sweet galenas''. In Gondor it grows as a wild plant. There it is known popularly as ''westmansweed'' and  appreciated for its sweet-scented flowers. 

Pipe-weed was apparently brought to Middle-earth by Númenóreans during the Second Age, as alluded by its Gondorian name. It was first grown among Hobbits by Tobold Hornblower in Longbottom (a region in the Shire). Despite its foreign origins, the Hobbits (possibly those in Bree) were the first to use it for smoking (as the Hobbits point out, not even the Wizards had thought of that). Popular Hobbit-grown varieties of pipe-weed include Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and Southern Star; its cultivation became an established industry.

The Wizard Gandalf learned to smoke pipe-weed from the Hobbits. In ''The Hobbit''  he turns smoke-rings into different colours. One palpable description of the weed's effects is given by Gandalf to fellow wizard Saruman upon a meeting of the White Council:

:''Yon&lt;!--not you--&gt; might find that smoke blown out cleared your mind of shadows within. Anyway, it gives patience, to listen to error without anger.''&lt;ref&gt;Unfinished Tales|The Hunt for the Ring&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Saruman initially derided Gandalf for smoking, at some point he took up the habit himself. After the destruction of Isengard, pipe-weed is found among its food stores, but the Hobbits Merry and Pippin fail to realize the sinister implications of the discovery that Saruman has had commerce with the Shire.

The Shire being based on an idealized version of the late nineteenth to early twentieth century rural England of Tolkien's childhood, it is consistent that the hobbits should be familiar with tobacco. However, Tolkien was conscious of avoiding direct use of the loanword &quot;tobacco&quot; (from Arawakan) in ''The Lord of the Rings'' as inconsistent with the generally &quot;Old World&quot;-inspired&quot; setting of Middle-earth.&lt;ref&gt;''The Road to Middle-earth'', T. A. Shippey p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; He does unambiguously call the plant &quot;tobacco&quot; in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Peoples of Middle-earth''.

Since the 1960s some counterculture Tolkien fans have surmised that pipe-weed is a variety of cannabis rather than a variety of tobacco. However, Tolkien, a committed tobacco pipe-smoker himself, dismissed any connection to cannabis.

====Seregon====
A plant with deep red flowers that grew upon the summit of the hill of Amon Rûdh in Beleriand, with the result that the hill looked as if dripped with blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Narn&quot;/&gt; The name can be translated from Sindarin as 'blood of stone'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Silmarillion'': Appendix, entries ''serech'' and ''gon-''.&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Tolkien also stated that it resembled the real-world plant stonecrop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Narn&quot;/&gt;

====Simbelmynë====


In ''The Lord of the Rings'', ''simbelmynë'' was a white flower that grew in Rohan primarily on the burial mounds of the Kings,&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Towers'', III 5 &quot;The King of the Golden Hall&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and most thickly on the grave of Helm Hammerhand.&lt;ref&gt;''The Return of the King'', Appendix A, II &quot;The House of Eorl&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The name, also traslated from Old English as '''Evermind''', is a reference to the plant's blossoming during the whole of the year.

Tolkien introduced flowers with similar characteristics into his later writings. In ''Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin'' it is stated that star-shaped white flowers of '''''uilos''''', &quot;the Evermind that knowns no season and withers not&quot;, grew before the Gate of Silver in Gondolin in the First Age;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuor&quot;&gt;''Unfinished Tales'': &quot;Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin&quot; and notes 27, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Cirion and Eorl'' white '''''alfirin''''' bloomed upon the mound of Elendil on Amon Anwar in Gondor.&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt; Their names are also reminiscent of ''Evermind'': ''uilos'' means 'everlasting snow' in Sindarin,&lt;ref name=&quot;uilos&quot;&gt;''The Etymologies'', stems OY-, GOLÓS-.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''alfirin'' is 'immortal'.&lt;ref name=&quot;alfirin&quot;/&gt; Christopher Tolkien expressedly equated them with the ''simbelmynë''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tuor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt;

====Taniquelassë====
An evergreen and fragrant tree that grew in the province of Nísimaldar in Númenor, where it was brought from Tol Eressëa by the Elves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt; The name means 'leaf of Taniquetil' in Quenya.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stem LAS&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uilos====
:''See [[#Simbelmynë|simbelmynë]].''

====Vardarianna====
An evergreen and fragrant tree that grew in the province of Nísimaldar in Númenor, where it was brought from Tol Eressëa by the Elves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt; The plant's designation is derived from the name of Varda, one of the Valier, and Quenya ''rianna'' 'crown-gift'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stems RIG-, ANA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yavannamírë====
An evergreen and fragrant tree with globed and scarlet fruits that grew in the province of Nísimaldar in Númenor, where it was brought from Tol Eressëa by the Elves.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN&quot;/&gt; The name can be translated from Quenya as 'jewel of Yavanna'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Etymologies'', stem MIR-.&lt;/ref&gt;

----

==Animals==
{{TOCright|limit=3}} 
This is a list of all '''animals''' that appear in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. In addition, this list encompasses several living creatures that were referred to at some point by Tolkien as being beast-shaped Maiar (angelic beings) rather than proper animals; such cases are annotated.

In Quenya, an Elven tongue devised by Tolkien, the general term for animals as distinct from plants was '''''kelvar'''''.&lt;ref&gt;The Silmarillion Chapter 2 &quot;Of Aulë and Yavanna&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Species===
====Craban (pl. Crebain)====
A large species of crow that inhabited the land of Dunland during the Third Age. They were often used as servants and spies by various evil powers, notably Saruman. During the War of the Ring, a flock of ''crebain'' searched for the Ring-bearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{The Fellowship of the Ring, Book II Ch. 3 &quot;The Ring Goes South&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crebain'' &quot;crows&quot; would be the regular plural form of Sindarin ''*craban'' &quot;crow,&quot; a word which (while unattested) seems to have ben adopted by Tolkien from Indo-European languages, particularly Proto-Germanic ''*kraban'', from which descended both Old High German ''hraban'' and English ''raven''. Also related are Latin ''corvus'' and English ''crow''.

==== Fell beasts ====

Flying creatures that were used by the Nazgûl as steeds during the later parts of the War of the Ring. However it is believed that this is not their correct name but are simply described as &quot;fell beasts&quot; and therefore they would have no correct assigned name so they are generally referred to as &quot;Fell Beasts&quot;. Tolkien describes one thus:

:''...if bird, then greater than all other birds... ...neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers... A creature of an older world maybe it was...''&lt;ref name=&quot;rotk&quot;&gt;Return of The King, &quot;The Battle of the Pelennor Fields&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few paragraphs later it is said to attack with &quot;beak and claw&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotk&quot; /&gt;

==== Great Eagles ====

A race of eagles of outstanding size, believed to have been sent to Middle-earth and Númenor by Manwë. At different times, Tolkien proposed that they had been either Maiarin spirits or just highly intelligent animals.  Gwaihir was one of the most famous of these Birds who was known for saving Gandalf, Bilbo and the 13 Dwarves in ''the Hobbit'' from Wargs and Goblins, also for retrieving Gandalf's body after his battle with Durin's bane.&lt;ref name=&quot;MR1&quot;&gt;Morgoth's Ring, &quot;Myths Transformed&quot; VIII, pp. 410-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Morgoth's Ring'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Spiders====
In ''The Hobbit'', it is described that a colony of sapient and over-sized spiders lived in the northern parts of Mirkwood at the end of the Third Age. The Elves of Thranduil's realm tried to exterminate them, but with no avail. During the events of the book, Thorin's company was captured by a colony of spiders and enmeshed in webs; however, Bilbo Baggins managed to free them, with the aid of his sword Sting and magic ring.&lt;ref&gt;The Hobbit|Ch. 8 &quot;Flies and Spiders&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Lord of the Rings'' adds that these spiders were of the brood of Shelob, who in turn was a child of Ungoliant and that they inhabited southern regions of Mirkwood as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shelob&quot;&gt;The Two Towers, &quot;Shelob's Lair&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that the spiders first appeared after the Shadow fell on Mirkwood around TA 1050.&lt;ref&gt;Return of the King, Appendix B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is known that Ungoliant and some of the Mirkwood spiders could talk, it is unclear if they all could.

====Kine of Araw====
Legendary white oxen that lived near the inland Sea of Rhûn, called thus by the men of Gondor who believed them to have been brought to Middle-earth by the Vala Oromë or Araw. Vorondil the Hunter made a horn of one of these beasts into an heirloom of the Stewards of Gondor. This horn was eventually owned by Boromir and was destroyed during the War of the Ring.

The Kine of Araw have been compared to aurochs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenbooks.theonering.net/guest/files/012005.html The Science of Middle-earth: The Kine of Araw] - Henry Gee, ''The Science of Middle-earth''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kirinki====
One of the many species of birds found in Númenor that were not known in Middle-earth. The ''kirinki'' are said to have been smaller than wrens, with scarlet feathers and &quot;piping voices on the edge of human hearing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Unfinished Tales, &quot;A Description of Númenor&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mearas ====
The ''mearas'' (singular ''mearh'') were a breed of wild horses in the north of Middle-earth. Their mortality is equal to Men and their intelligence and strength are extraordinary.  They surpass normal horses in the same degree that Elves surpass Men.

They descend from Felaróf, who was tamed by the first King of Rohan, Eorl the Young. Ever since, they have been the mounts of the King and Princes of Rohan alone. During the War of the Ring, however, Gandalf the Grey's friendship with Shadowfax, lord of the Mearas, led to Shadowfax allowing Gandalf to ride him at the end of the Third Age. They may be descended from Nahar, horse of the Vala Oromë.

====Mûmakil====

A race of animals that lived in the lands of Harad, resembling elephants but much larger and said to have been its ancestors. The ''mûmakil'' were used by the Haradrim both as beasts of burden and in warcraft, most prominently during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

====Wargs====

A race of wolves that was particularly evil-natured and usually in alliance with Orcs. Sometimes described as &quot;demonic wolves&quot;, they appear in ''The Lay of Leithian'', ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. It is believed that they are afraid of Fire as Gandalf uses flaming projectiles against them when trapped with 13 dwarves and Bilbo Baggins. A flame set the Warg chiefs coat alight which sparked panic among the rest who also caught a light and ran about in blind pain.

Hi, you can view my profile here: [http://www.wikieducator.org/User:Vroopun Wikieducator]

==My project==
There are efforts being made to provide open content to the world. My humble contribution would be to provide a learning material for students wanting to take digital literacy course. This project will be in the form of a booklet, providing real world examples and tasks to be completed using computers and free softwares.

Each section will be divided into the following section:
* Learing outcome
* Pre-Test
* Problem area
* Tasks
* Recommended procedure to complete the task
* Post-Test 

I remeber having read somewhere that, the complexity related to the thickness of the material. This booklet will be in short topics form and independent from other features being covered for the digital literacy programme.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">i'm not sure ariana was beaten, but in fact raped. ron's and hermione's reactions seem to evince this. the fact that ariana's father is who avenges what harm is done to her is further proof of this. also, her name, arguably derived from &quot;ariadne&quot; may mean &quot;most holy&quot;. so, the reference could be to virginity.

:The unnamed editor above is reading an awful lot into a very sparse description. I would argue, speaking as a father, that anyone who did irreparable damage to my children, whether by simple assault and battery, or by sexual assault, would inspire the same sort of vengeance as attributed to Percival. (Whether I would actually do what he did, given the power, is debatable in either case.) I personally don't see that in the description given, though I'll grant it as a remote possibility.

If Ariana was 14 as stated she must have some training right?

:My recollection is that it was stated that she was 14 '''when she died''', which means that she must have been significantly younger when attacked. The feeling I get from Aberforth, and I'll grant it is no more than a feeling, is that she was somewhere between 6 and 8, no older than maybe 10 or so, when she was attacked. She certainly does not seem to have attended Hogwarts. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:51, 26 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Vim is available for Microsoft Windows, but there are many issues attendant to that platform that make effective use of Vim quite challenging. This section deals with some of the issues relevant to users who are using or considering Vim for use on Windows systems.

== Installation ==
There are a variety of installation options for users who wish to install Vim on Windows.

These include:
* Self-installing executable
* Win32s GUI executable 
* Windows 3.1 GUI executable
* Win32 console executable
* Win64 binaries for x64 

Moreover, if desired, a user may compile Vim from source. This may be useful or even necessary if the user wants to add support for additional options that are not compiled into one of the pre-existing binaries by default. Perhaps the most common scenario for compiling on Windows is when the user wishes to add support for a programming language (either a specific language, or a specific version of the language) that is not included in the Windows binaries by default.

When installing Vim, the user has to accommodate for any required elements that do not come with Windows by default, such as a compiler and make.

== General usage ==
Users who are not well-acquainted with how Vim works and the general &quot;vi way of doing things&quot; may find Vim especially challenging. This is especially so if they are already comfortable with the workflow of most other text editors on Windows. Because of this, there's actually more than one way of doing things if you want to use Vim on Windows. One way of using Vim on windows can be called ''standard vim workflow'' (Vim); another way would be the ''windows vim workflow'' (WinVim).

Using the &quot;WinVim&quot; style definitely has advantages for those users who are not amenable to the steep learning curve commonly associated with Vim, however there are many features within Vim that are difficult to use when working from the &quot;WinVim&quot; paradigm. Whether one chooses one usage pattern over the other, or some combination of the two, is largely a matter of personal preference.

=== Behave mswin ===
Vim configuration allows the user to set the editor behavior to reflect some aspects of the &quot;WinVim&quot; working style. This enables a 'scaled down' version of the WinVim style, users who want a very detailed emulation of WinVim style will have to do more than just set 'behave mswin'. See &lt;code&gt;:help behave&lt;/code&gt; for more details.

=== Cream editor ===
The Cream editor is an example of a Vim configuration that is designed for users who prefer the &quot;WinVim&quot; style of working.

== Compatibility ==
For those who are familiar with UNIX-like operating systems, and leverage such systems to enhance and extend Vim, the Windows operating system may present some unexpected differences and limitations.

=== Path separators ===
Windows (by default) uses the backslash character to delimit path-steps in file paths. This can be challenging for users who are not used to this. See &lt;code&gt;:help shellslash&lt;/code&gt; for more details.

=== Command piping ===
The Windows command shell does not support command piping and redirection in the same way as UNIX systems. Some users may find this especially challenging, because it significantly limits the way Vim can interact with other programs external to the editor. There are workarounds, however, that allow a user to approximate some of the power that comes natively from piping and redirection.

==== Temporary text transport file ====
A temporary text transport file is one workaround that allows Vim to interact with other programs on Windows without requiring use of pipes and redirection. The basic approach is to specify one or more temporary files on the local file system that Vim and external programs use to &quot;transport&quot; text between each other.
&lt;noinclude&gt;

== Comparison with CUA-style editors ==

The following table shows a comparison of some basic Vim functionality as viewed from the perspective of CUA [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Common_User_Access] style editors.

This is intended as a starting place for those who may be unfamiliar with Vim, but familiar with Windows-based editors that use a standard &quot;File :: Edit :: Help&quot; style menu, such as Notepad.exe, which is available on most Windows installations by default.

In the context of Middle Eastern food, Sweet Pepper most commonly refers to Paprika. The spice blend Baharat, the most-used spice in the Arabic cuisine, can use Sweet Pepper as the term for Paprika. To confuse matters, in Syria the spice mixture Baharat consists mostly of Allspice. Allspice is referred to as Sweet Pepper in some cuisines because of the shape of the seeds which is similar to pepper corns.</text>

==Sketching==

Sketching is the process of creating a two dimensional line drawing of some features of the object to be rendered.  They are used to assist the 3D Tools in the formation of the part model. 

Before a Sketch can be created, a plane must be selected.  Planes can be picked from one of the Cartesian planes (XY, XZ, or YZ planes), from a predefined user plane, or from an existing flat surface on the part model. 

Sketch Tools are used to render image parameters.

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The most basic input and output in Java (&lt;code&gt;System.in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; fields that have been used in the [[Java Programming/Basic IO|Basic I/O]]) is done using streams. Streams are objects that represent sources and destinations of data.  Streams that are sources of data can be read from, and streams that are destinations of data can be written to. A stream in Java is an ordered sequence of bytes of undetermined length. Streams are ordered and in sequence so that the java virtual machine can understand and work upon the stream. Streams are analogous to water streams. They exist as a communication medium, just like electromagnetic waves in communication. The order or sequence of bytes in a Java stream allow the virtual machine to classify it among other streams.

Java has various inbuilt streams implemented as classes in the package &lt;code&gt;java.io&lt;/code&gt; like the classes of &lt;code&gt;System.in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt;. Streams can be classed as both input and output streams. All Java streams are derived from Input Stream (&lt;code&gt;java.io.InputStream&lt;/code&gt;) and Output Stream (&lt;code&gt;java.io.OutputStream&lt;/code&gt;) classes. They are abstract base classes meant for other stream classes. The &lt;code&gt;System.in&lt;/code&gt; is the input stream class derivative and analogically &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; is the output counterpart. Both are basic classes used to directly interact with input and output through console, similarly follows &lt;code&gt;System.err&lt;/code&gt;. Also Java has streams to communicate across different parts of a program or even among threads. There are also classes that &quot;filter&quot; streams, changing one format to another (e.g. class &lt;code&gt;DataOutputStream&lt;/code&gt;, which translates various primitive types to byte streams).

It is a characteristic of streams that they deal only in one discrete unit of data at a time, and different streams deal with different types of data.  If one had a stream that represented a destination for bytes, for example, one would send data to the destination one byte at a time.  If a stream was a source of byte data, one would read the data a byte at a time.  Because this is the only way to access data from a stream, in this latter case, we wouldn't know when we had read all the data from the stream until we actually got there.  When reading a stream, one generally has to check each unit of data each read operation to see if the end of the stream has been reached (with byte streams, the special value is the integer -1, or FFFF hex).

== Input streams ==

Input streams acquire bytes for our programmed java application/program (e.g. a file, an array, a keyboard or monitor, etc.). &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt; is an abstract class that represents a source of byte data.  It has a &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt; method, which returns the next byte in the stream and a &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt; method, which should be called by a program when that program is done with the stream.  The &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt; method is overloaded, and can take a byte array to read to.  It has a &lt;code&gt;skip()&lt;/code&gt; method that can skip a number of bytes, and an &lt;code&gt;available()&lt;/code&gt; method that a program can use to determine the number of bytes immediately available to be read, as not all the data is necessarily ready immediately.  As an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated, but describes the general behavior of an input stream.  A few examples of concrete subclasses would be &lt;code&gt;ByteArrayInputStream&lt;/code&gt;, which reads from a byte array, and &lt;code&gt;FileInputStream&lt;/code&gt;, which reads byte data from a file.

In the [[#code-listing-1|following example]], we print &quot;Hello world!&quot; on the screen several times. The number of times the message is printed is stored in a file named &lt;code&gt;source.txt&lt;/code&gt;. This file should only contain a integer and should be placed in the same folder of the &lt;code&gt;ConfiguredApplication&lt;/code&gt; class.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-1&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 9.1: Example of input stream.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
 
public class ConfiguredApplication {
 
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
 
    // Data reading
    File file = new File(&quot;source.txt&quot;);
    FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream(file);
 
    StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();
 
    int character = 0;
    while ((character = stream.read()) != -1) {
      buffer.append((char) character);
    }
 
    stream.close();
 
    // Data use
    Integer readInteger = Integer.parseInt(buffer.toString());
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; readInteger ; i++) {
      System.out.println(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
    }
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The class start to identify the filename with a &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; object. The &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; object is used by an input stream as the source of the stream. We create a buffer and a character to prepare the data loading. The buffer will contain all the file content and the character will temporary contain each character present in the file, one after one. This is done &lt;code&gt;while{}&lt;/code&gt;in the loop. Each iteration of the loop will copy a character from the stream to the buffer. The loop ends when no more character is present in the stream. Then we close the stream. The last part of the code use the data we have loaded in from the file. It is transformed into string and then into an integer (so the data must be an integer). If it works, the integer is used to determine the number of time we print &quot;Hello world!&quot; on the screen. No try/catch block has been defined for readability but the thrown exceptions should be caught.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Explain why we need to call &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt;.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Let's try with the following source file:
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 9.2: source.txt'''&lt;/span&gt;
4}}

We should obtain this:
{{XCode|1='''Output for ConfiguredApplication'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java ConfiguredApplication
Hello world!
Hello world!
Hello world!
Hello world!
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

{{XWarning|If it shows a &lt;code&gt;FileNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt;, the source may not be placed in the right folder or its name is badly spelled.&lt;br/&gt;If it shows a &lt;code&gt;NumberFormatException&lt;/code&gt;, the content of the file may not be an integer.}}

There is also &lt;code&gt;Reader&lt;/code&gt; which is an abstract class that represents a source of character data.  It is analogous to &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;, except that it deals with characters instead of bytes (remember that Java uses Unicode, so that a character is 2 bytes, not one).  Its methods are generally similar to those of &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;.  Concrete subclasses include classes like &lt;code&gt;FileReader&lt;/code&gt;, which reads characters from files, and &lt;code&gt;StringReader&lt;/code&gt;, which reads characters from strings.  You can also convert an &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt; object to a Reader object with the &lt;code&gt;InputStreamReader&lt;/code&gt; class, which can be &quot;wrapped around&quot; an &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt; object (by passing it as an argument in its constructor).  It uses a character encoding scheme (which can be changed by the programmer) to translate a byte into a 16-bit Unicode character.

== Output streams ==

Output Streams direct streams of bytes outwards to the environment from our program or application. &lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;/code&gt; is an abstract class which is the destination counterpart of &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;code&gt;write()&lt;/code&gt; method which can be used to write a byte to the stream.  The method is overloaded, and can take an array as well.  A &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt; method closes the stream when the application is finished with it, and it has a &lt;code&gt;flush()&lt;/code&gt; method.  The stream may wait until it has a certain amount before it writes it all at once for efficiency.  If the stream object is buffering any data before writing it, the &lt;code&gt;flush()&lt;/code&gt; method will force it to write all of this data.  Like &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;, this class cannot be instantiated, but has concrete subclasses that parallel those of &lt;code&gt;InputStream&lt;/code&gt;, eg &lt;code&gt;ByteArrayOutputStream&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FileOutputStream&lt;/code&gt;, etc.

In the [[#code-listing-2|following example]], we store the current time in an already existing file called &lt;code&gt;log.txt&lt;/code&gt; located in the same folder than the class.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-2&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 9.2: Example of output stream.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.util.Date;
 
public class LogTime {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Generate data
        String timeInString = new Date().toString();

        // Store data
        File file = new File(&quot;log.txt&quot;);
        FileOutputStream stream = new FileOutputStream(file);

        byte[] timeInBytes = timeInString.getBytes();

        stream.write(timeInBytes);
        stream.flush();
        stream.close();
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

This case is more simple as we can put all the data in the stream at the same time. The first part of the code generate a string containing the current time. Then we create a &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; object identifying the output file and an output stream for this file. We write the data in the stream, flush it and close it. That's all. No try/catch block has been defined for readability but the thrown exceptions should be caught.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Explain why we need to call &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt;.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Now let's execute it:
{{XCode|1='''LogTime execution'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
$ java LogTime
&lt;/pre&gt;}}

We should obtain this content:
{{XCode|1='''Code listing 9.4: log.txt'''&lt;/span&gt;
{{#time: D M j G:i:s CET Y }}}}

{{XWarning|If it shows a &lt;code&gt;FileNotFoundException&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code&gt;IOException&lt;/code&gt;, the file should not have been created or it is not placed in the right folder.}}

There is also &lt;code&gt;Writer&lt;/code&gt; which is a character counterpart of &lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;/code&gt;, and a destination counterpart to Reader, this is also an abstract superclass.  Particular implementations parallel those of Reader, eg &lt;code&gt;FileWriter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;StringWriter&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;OutputStreamWriter&lt;/code&gt;, for converting a regular &lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;/code&gt; into a reader so that it can take character data.

== &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.err&lt;/code&gt; ==

&lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; is a class in the package &lt;code&gt;java.lang&lt;/code&gt; with a number of static members that are available to Java programs.  Two members that are useful for console output are &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.err&lt;/code&gt;.  Both System.out and System.err are &lt;code&gt;PrintStream&lt;/code&gt; objects.  &lt;code&gt;PrintStream&lt;/code&gt; is a subclass of &lt;code&gt;FilterOutputStream&lt;/code&gt;, itself a subclass of &lt;code&gt;OutputStream&lt;/code&gt; (discussed above), and its main purpose is to translate a wide variety of data types into streams of bytes that represent that data in characters according to some encoding scheme.

&lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.err&lt;/code&gt; both display text to a console where the user can read it, however what this means exactly depends on the platform used and the environment in which the program is running.  In BlueJay and Eclipse IDE, for example, there is a special &quot;terminal&quot; window that will display this output.  If the program is launched in Windows, the output will be sent to the DOS prompt (usually this means that you have to launch the program from the command line to see the output).

&lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;System.err&lt;/code&gt; differ in what they're supposed to be used for.  &lt;code&gt;System.out&lt;/code&gt; should be used for normal program output, &lt;code&gt;System.err&lt;/code&gt; should be used to inform the user that some kind of error has occurred in the program.  In some situations, this may be important.  In DOS, for instance, a user can redirect standard output to some other destination (a file, for example), but error output will not be redirected, but rather displayed on the screen.  If this weren't the case, the user might never be able to tell that an error had occurred.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Todo|Illustrate how the &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; method works, emphasize that this method does not break up lines, but that this can be accomplished with the &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; escape sequence. talk about how it works with different data types, and then introduce the &lt;code&gt;println()&lt;/code&gt; method as a convenience method that automatically adds the &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; character.}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== New I/O ==
Versions of Java prior to J2SE 1.4 only supported stream-based blocking I/O. This required a thread per stream being handled, as no other processing could take place while the active thread blocked waiting for input or output.  This was a major scalability and performance issue for anyone needing to implement any Java network service.  Since the introduction of NIO ([[w:New I/O|New I/O]]) in J2SE 1.4, this scalability problem has been rectified by the introduction of a non-blocking I/O framework (though there are a number of open issues in the NIO API as implemented by Oracle).

The non-blocking IO framework, though considerably more complex than the original blocking IO framework, allows any number of &quot;channels&quot; to be handled by a single thread. The framework is based on the Reactor Pattern.

'''[[w:Eiffel programming language|Eiffel]]''' is a complete object-oriented language designed from the ground up to support object-oriented programming according to the design by contract (DbC) paradigm. This WikiBook introduces the fundamentals of Eiffel.

==Introduction==
Eiffel is a pure real-world object-oriented language designed as such from the ground up in the early 1980s by Bertrand Meyer. It embodies several formal techniques, such as the use of assertions making them accessible to the programmer and designer in an integrated technique called design by contract, used to break down the functionality of software into cooperating modules (classes). The correct interaction of these modules is checked by the use of preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants, integrated with the exception handling mechanism. Eiffel incorporates an elegant design of multiple inheritance and genericity. It is strongly typed so that many common errors are caught at compile time, but without the frustrations of earlier type systems, and has no type casts because the type system never needs to be subverted in th&lt;/pre&gt;is way (also avoiding run time type cast exceptions). Strong typing also means that issues can be resolved at compile time, resulting in better performance at run time. Eiffel includes an efficient garbage collection system, relieving the programmer from the burden of memory management, leaks, and dangling pointers. Eiffel is not interpreted and generates machine code for efficiency. Eiffel has a clean syntax based on Ada (scrapping the superfluous BEGINs of ALGOL and ()s of C-based languages) and defined in EBNF.
==Classes==
The basic construct in Eiffel is the class. In fact there is no other construct of note. So immediately we have a language which is fundamentally simpler than C/C++ and Object Pascal. 
A class represents entities, the attributes of those entities and the operations that those entities can perform. This gives you a fundamental mechanism for project organization because any application is organized into a set of interacting classes.
Classes represent real world entities in a model, but can represent more artificial artifacts that occur only in computer programs. An example of an Eiffel class is:
 '''class'''
     ''CAR''
 '''end'''

A class represents all objects of that type. For instance, in the real world we have one concept of CAR, but there are many instances of CARs. We should be careful to distinguish between a class as a conceptual design pattern of entities and objects that represent the entities themselves. 

==Libraries==
One of the greatest promises of OO is reuse; that is, you should not have to rewrite many basic concepts that frequently appear. Classes that frequently appear are organized into libraries, such as EiffelBase for many basic types such as INTEGER, REAL, STRING, etc. Many collections are also in the base library such as LISTs and ARRAYs, with many others. 
Not only do you have the EiffelBase (sometimes called Kernel and ELKS) library, but many other libraries to interface to databases, CORBA, etc. Also on the Macintosh with Eiffel for Xcode, you get libraries interfacing to Carbon and Cocoa, the two major APIs for GUI programming on OS X. Carbon can simply be used as an Eiffel API to MacOS, but with a single call, it becomes a full event-driven application framework like MacApp and PowerPlant, making application development even simpler. You will find Carbon cleaner and easier to understand and find what you want than any framework written in C++, and it is the consistency of the Eiffel language that enables this. Carbon also follows uniform naming patterns that many other Eiffel libraries vendors have adopted. This means that the programmer has less to remember and has to consult API references less frequently. 
Libraries are not defined as part of the Eiffel language—they are simply collections of related classes.

==Features==
Each class has a set of features that represent the attributes and operations of a class. Operations on an object typically alter the state of the object, that is, will change the values of one or more of its attributes. In Eiffel, such operations are known as procedures. Fields in an object can be changed only by routines in the object. 
Functions are computations that return an answer to a query about the state of an object, but do not change the state of an object (although this is by convention, rather than being enforced in Eiffel). Computational functions and procedures are together known as routines. Functions, however, have more in common with reading an attribute field or even constant than with procedures. When performing a query, it does not matter to the querier whether the answer is retrieved from a pre-computed field of the object or by a computation that is done at that moment. Eiffel needs no low-level call operator such as ‘()’ to invoke functions. This makes Eiffel programs very flexible because functions with no arguments can be redefined as fields or constants.
For example, the attribute speed of a CAR object could either be stored in a field or computed from other inputs or fields stored in the object. (Indeed reading a field involves a computation of retrieving the contents of that item; this computation is in fact hidden to the programmer, which leads many to think that field access and functions are different, but really field or constant access is functional access. This is called the Principle of Uniform Access and makes software very flexible.) 
Attributes themselves can be fields or constants. A field sets aside space within each created object where the value is stored. A constant is compiled into the code, and does not use up space in an object. 
To summarize: routines are either procedures or functions; attributes can be fields, constants or functions. These four entities, procedures, functions, fields and constants are collectively known as features. 
An example of a class with features is: 
 '''class'''
   ''CAR''
 '''feature'''
   ''colour'': ''COLOUR'' -- a field
 
   ''velocity'': ''INTEGER'' '''is''' -- a function 
      '''do''' 
        ''Result''  := ''speed'' 
       '''end''' 
 
    ''wheels'': ''INTEGER'' '''is''' ''4''  -- a constant 
    ''speed'': ''INTEGER''
 
    ''stop'' '''is'''  -- a procedure 
       '''do''' 
         ''speed'' := ''0'' 
       '''end'''
 '''end'''  -- ''CAR''
Note that the features of a class are introduced by the keyword feature. A number of other points can be seen about Eiffel style and syntax. Comments are introduced by -- (like an em–dash, —). This indicates a comment to the end of line. Grouped entities are terminated by the keyword end. Eiffel has no begin keyword since it is superfluous. (Small syntactic problems like not putting a semicolon before an else as in Pascal are avoided in Eiffel. Remember that semicolons are merely typographical for human readability in Eiffel and therefore optional. Code in in fact more readable without semicolons.) Also superfluous are semicolons, but these may optionally be placed between constructs. Eiffel has a clean and modern syntax making programs much easier to read. 
The features speed  and velocity  can be interchanged as queries. In fact, this is an artificial example to show only the differences and similarities between functions and fields. 
In Eiffel style, keywords are shown in bold and user named entities in italics. Class names are given in uppercase, which follows the mathematical typographical convention for types. Eiffel is not case sensitive, so it is up to the programmer to follow style conventions. Entity names made up of more than one word separate the constituent words with underscore ‘_’, for example SPEEDY_CAR. (As you can see, the underscore style is more consistent than the capitalization style, SpeedyCar, which does not work for upper case type names, or constant names as in C style. The underscore style is also more readable, giving a better approximation of white space in between words.)
Note also in your editor, you will not have to enter words in bold and italics—these are done by formatting software. 
C and C++ programmers might be wondering how to make features public, protected and private. With Eiffel you have far more control; any set of features introduced by the feature keyword can be exported to other specific classes. Thus you have the possibility of many shades of grey between public and private. You might want a feature to be public to some specific classes, but private to others. This also covers the friend mechanism of C++ since a special implementation relation- ship can be specified between certain classes. 
In Eiffel there are two specific classes ANY and NONE. ANY is at the top of the inheritance hierarchy and exporting to ANY is equivalent to public. ANY is automatically inherited by all classes. It is like Object in Java, and TObject in MacApp. NONE is at the bottom of the inheritance hierarchy and exporting to NONE is the equivalent of protected in C++. There is no strict equivalent of private, as Eiffel believes it is not sensible to restrict visibility in subclasses. We will not look at the specifics of export since this is covered in longer tutorials and this is meant to be a short tutorial. 

==Inheritance==
Perhaps the distinguishing feature of object-oriented languages—after classes—to many people is inheritance. Simply put, inheritance is the ability to create a new class from an existing class. It only makes sense to do this when the existing class provides features wanted in the new class. 
Where features are not exactly what is required in the new class, they can be redefined. Redefinition can take two forms—either redefinition of an operation or function, or redefinition of type. Redefinition of operation is only meaningful where the feature is a routine. Redefinition of type can be applied to fields, functions, and arguments 
In order to build new classes out of existing classes and to reuse features already defined in those classes, you use inheritance. In Eiffel, you use the inheritance clause as follows: 
 
 '''deferred''' '''class''' 
   ''VEHICLE''
 '''feature''' 
   ''velocity'': ''INTEGER'' '''is''' -- a function 
      '''do''' 
         ''Result'' := ''speed ''
      '''end''' 
 
   ''wheels'': ''INTEGER'' '''is''' 
      '''deferred''' 
      '''end''' 
  
   ''speed'': ''INTEGER''
 
   ''stop'' '''is''' -- a procedure 
      '''deferred''' 
      '''end''' 
 '''end'''  -- ''VEHICLE ''
 
 
 '''class''' 
   ''CAR'' 
 '''inherit'''
   ''VEHICLE'' 
 '''feature''' 
   ''COLOUR'': ''COLOUR'' -- a field 
   ''wheels'': ''INTEGER'' '''is'''  4  -- a constant 
   ''speed'': ''INTEGER''
 
   ''stop'' '''is''' -- a procedure 
      '''do''' 
         ''speed'' := ''0''
      '''end''' 
 '''end'''  -- CAR 

This is a very simple example of inheritance—it only shows single inheritance. Eiffel has multiple inheritance. As those who have used a language with multiple inheritance know, if two features with the same name are inherited from two different classes, a clash occurs. Eiffel solves this by having a rename clause that allows you to rename one or both of the features to remove the clash. This is different to the scope resolution operator :: of C++, where disambiguation must be done on every reference to the clashing inherited members. 
The example also does not show how to redefine a feature. If you wish to redefine a feature, you must put a redefine  clause in your inheritance clause. The example also shows deferred features. You do not have to put a redefine clause in order to give these a definition in a subclass. Defining a deferred feature is called effecting that feature. Our example shows two deferred features, stop and wheels. Note that stop is effected as a routine, whereas wheels is effected as a constant. 
Apart from rename and redefine  clauses in the inheritance clause, you can change the export status of inherited features with the export clause (you should not use the export clause to restrict access that was previously granted in a parent—that would be mean, but it has some negative theoretical type considerations). Two other clauses that give complete control over inheritance are the undefine and select clauses. Thus, when inheriting any class, you can control the inheritance with the five subclauses: rename, export, undefine, redefine, and select.
Many object-oriented languages do not provide redefinition of types and thus are no variant, but this means that many things that can be easily achieved by simple type redefinition are not possible and must be done by providing extra code and classes. In languages that have redefinition of types, the redefinition can be covariant or contravariant. Covariant means the new type must be a subtype of the original type; contravariant means the new type must be a supertype of the original. 
Covariant redefinition of fields and functions provides no problems, but covariant redefinition of arguments does create a problem that illegal types can be passed as arguments. However, this is the most practical way to redefine types. Consider that the type of a field can be changed in a subclass:
     ''a_field'': ''A_TYPE''
  
     ''set_a_field'' (''to_field'': ''A_TYPE'') '''is''' 
          '''do''' 
               ''a_field'' := ''to_field'' 
          '''end''' 


in a subclass these could be redefined as follows: 

     ''a_field'': ''B_TYPE''
 
     ''set_a_field'' (''to_field'': ''B_TYPE'') '''is''' 
          '''do''' 
               ''a_field'' := ''to_field'' 
          '''end''' 

note that the type of the to_field argument has followed the type of the type of the field. This sets the practical precedent for covariants of arguments. Now Eiffel does even better than this—in the second class, only the type of the argument has changed but the code is exactly the same and needlessly repeated. To deal with this very common situation, Eiffel introduces anchored types:
     ''a_field'': ''A_TYPE''
 
     ''set_a_field'' (''to_field'': '''like''' ''a_field'') '''is''' 
          '''do''' 
               ''a_field'' := ''to_field''
          '''end'''

and in the subclass all you need to do is redefine the field’s type:
     ''a_field'': ''B_TYPE''

and no redefinition of the set routine is needed. Using anchored types, most uses of covariant arguments can be avoided. Another point in Eiffel is that accessor or get_ routines need not be provided since fields can be accessed functionally by the principle of uniform access. C programmers argue that this breaks the principle of data hiding—in C accessing fields directly exposes the structure of the class, but in Eiffel it does not, the principle of data hiding being subsumed by the cleaner principle of uniform access. 
The other important facility that Eiffel provides is multiple inheritance. Most people understand the use of single inheritance where a subclass gains characteristics from a single parent class. In some cases this can be generalized to multiple inheritance where a subclass can gain characteristics from multiple classes. 
Some people see problems with multiple inheritance since classes designed in a single inheritance environment tend to become large and unwieldy, covering multiple concepts. Multiple inheritance allows finer-grained design of classes with a single concept per class which can be combined to form new classes. Thus much more powerful object-oriented design can be accomplished with multiple inheritance. 
A problem that multiple inheritance introduces in ambiguity. Suppose the same feature is inherited from two or more classes with slightly different implementations. Which is the correct one to invoke when a client calls it? 
Eiffel resolves all such ambiguities in its inheritance clause, by renaming and selecting inherited features. For example:
 '''class''' 
     ''PLANE ''
 '''inherit'''
     ''VEHICLE'' 
          '''rename'''
               ''drive'' ''as'' '''taxi'''
          '''end'''
     ''FLYING_OBJECT''
          '''select'''
               ''move''
          '''end''' 
 '''feature''' 
     ... 
 '''end''' -- PLANE
The inheritance clause in Eiffel can also be used to export existing features to more classes, undefine features, and redefine features. 
Since ambiguity is completely resolved within the inheritance clause in Eiffel, this is a fundamentally different approach to C++, where the client programmer must be aware of the nature of multiple inheritance in a class being used and resolve the ambiguity in every access to that class. If the class changes then the potential to have to change all the client classes exists. Because of this messiness in C++, many people believe that multiple inheritance is per se messy, but this messiness does not exist in Eiffel—any headaches in resolving problems due to multiple inheritance must be handled by the creator of the class, not left to clients.
Another aspect of inheritance is that either interfaces or implementations, or both can be inherited. In languages such as Java, only interfaces can be multiply inherited—implementations can be inherited only from one class. Java does this in order to avoid the ambiguity problem that we have seen is elegantly solved in Eiffel. 
The problem with Java’s scheme of restricting inheritance of implementation is that interfaces must be implemented in the classes that inherit them. This gives the possibility that the same code must be implemented in many subclasses. Often just a default implementation is required between many classes, and this can be put in an appropriate ancestor class with implementation inheritance. Thus full multiple inheritance of implementation is required for practical programming—arguments against it are purely theoretical. 
In Eiffel, there is no separate concept for interface as in Java, everything is included in the class concept. To overcome some of the shortcomings of not having true multiple inheritance in Java, inner classes can be used to provide default implementations, but this is just adding complexity in other areas. In Eiffel, if you are really convinced that single inheritance of implementation and only interfaces can be multiply inherited, you can program in this style—you won’t want to follow that rule for long before it becomes apparent that Java’s interface style of multiple inheritance is a burdensome restriction. 

==Genericity==
Inheritance is one of the fundamental mechanisms for reuse—so is genericity. Genericity is also important in making programs type safe without resorting to type casts. Java does not have genericity, and many type casts are needed to make up for this deficiency—this is burdensome to the programmer. C++ has genericity in the form of template classes. If you have had problems understanding C++ templates— don’t worry—Eiffel’s generic syntax is much easier and more powerful because it also allows generic parameters to be constrained; this is known as constrained genericity (also known as bounded- and F-bounded polymorphism). 
In order to use genericity you create a generic class with formal generic parameters. These are generic types where the type is left open to be instantiated by actual generic types. Generics are most useful in collection classes. For example, LISTs can store INTEGERs, ANIMALs, and other objects. Thus the LIST class is declared as:
 '''class''' ''LIST'' [''T''] 
    ... 
 '''end''' 
The actual lists are instantiated as: 
    ''il'': ''LIST'' [''INTEGER'']  -- ''LIST'' of ''INTEGER''s 
    ''animal_list'': ''LIST'' [''ANIMAL''] -- ''LIST'' of ''ANIMAL''s 
    ''list_list'': ''LIST'' [''LIST'' [''INTEGER'']]  -- ''LIST'' of ''LIST''s of ''INTEGER''s 
A generic '''class''' can also restrict the kinds of actual parameters. For example:
 '''class''' ''SHELF'' [''ITEM'' -&gt; ''SHELF_ITEM''] 
    ... 
 '''end'''

Here any actual generic type must be a SHELF_ITEM in order to instantiate a valid shelf. 
The key point to remember about generics is that they allow you to write general algorithmic patterns that apply to a variety of types. The variety of types can be restricted with constrained genericity, where the genericity is known to work only on certain types. Where the generic types are not constrained, the algorithmic pattern is universally applicable. 


Object Creation and Garbage Collection 
Objects are created with the special create instruction. An example looks as follows:
   ''c'': ''C'' 
   '''create''' ''c''.''make''
or 
   '''create''' {''D''} ''c''.''make''

In the first example, an object of type C is created and attached to the reference c. (Remember Eiffel is case insensitive, but the name c here is used for a variable and C for a class type, but there is no name clash.) In the second example, an object of type D, where D conforms to C (that is D is a subclass of C), is created and attached to c. 
The other point to note is that, if you have a create routine declared for the class, the create routine must be called. In the examples it is the make routine. In order to flag a routine as a create routine, you must include it in the create clause at the start of a class. (This clause used to be creation, but now the simple word create is used, so you don’t have to remember the difference between creation and create.) Create routines are a bit like constructors in C++ and Java. More than one can be declared, but unlike C++ and Java constructors, you can declare several create routines with the same signature. 
 '''class''' 
   ''CAR'' 
 '''inherit''' 
   ''VEHICLE''
 '''create'''
   ''make''
 '''feature''' 
   ''make'' '''is''' -- a create routine 
      '''do''' 
         ... 
      '''end''' 
 '''end''' -- CAR


Also different to C++ and Java is the fact that create routines can be called as normal routines. That is so long as the creation routines are exported as normal routines. The export status as a create routine and a normal routine can be different, so, if you really don’t want your create routines called as normal routines, you can prevent this. 
Creation routines have a very important function—that is to leave the object in an initial valid state. An object created without a create routine might not be in a valid state. The code in a create routine ensures that the object is valid and satisfies the class invariant.
Eiffel has no delete instruction. This is because, as with Java, Eiffel is garbage collected. Garbage collection is known to completely cure the programming ills of dangling pointers and memory leaks. This greatly simplifies the programming effort by removing one of the largest bookkeeping headaches for programmers. Garbage collection has also proven to be very efficient in modern implementations.

==Other Instructions==
In order to write routines, you use a sequence of instructions. As a point of terminology, Eiffel calls these instructions rather than statements, as in other languages. Eiffel provides the usual kinds of instructions: routine call, assignment, if then elseif ... else, loop, object creation and inspect (case or switch). These are just about the only instructions that Eiffel provides. Much of the power of Eiffel is provided in the libraries, which build upon the basic features of the language. 

==Class variables==
If you have used Smalltalk, C++, or Java, you will be wondering how to create class variables; that is variables which do not have one copy per object, but one per class of objects. The Eiffel equivalent for doing this is once routines. These are covered by the many other tutorials and books on Eiffel. 

==Design by Contract==
One of the most significant aspects of Eiffel is that it is not only a language with which you can write executable software, but it is a language that embodies many design concepts. Thus you can use the same language for design and implementation. The notion of design by contract is a formal way to divide up the work between a routine and its caller, so that all the work is done and it is not repeated, which would cause performance problems. 
Not only is design by contract a formal way of designing interfaces, but a good way to document interfaces. Often routine signatures are not enough to show how to call a routine—contract information adds the extra details. 
The most noticeable language features are the preconditions and postconditions of routines in the requires and ensures clauses respectively. An example is:
   ''square_root'' (''n'': ''REAL''): ''REAL'' '''is''' 
      '''require'''
         ''n'' &gt;= ''0'' 
      '''do'''
         ''Result'' := ... sqrt calculation 
      '''ensure''' 
         ''n'' = ''Result'' * ''Result'' 
      '''end''' -- ''square_root''
Here the requires clause tells the caller that they are responsible for checking that the argument passed is nonnegative. The ensure clause tells us some properties of the calculation and the conditions we expect to hold after the routine is complete. Not only do these clauses document what is expected of the caller and of the routine itself, but these are checked at run time to make sure the software is operating correctly (as long as assertion monitoring is turned on—it can be turned off once you are confident that the software is working correctly). 
If the assertion checks fail, an exception is raised. If the require clause fails, an exception is raised in the caller. If an ensure clause fails, an exception is raised in the routine itself. Exceptions may be caught with a rescue clause and if able to be corrected, the routine can be restarted with the retry instruction: 
   ''square_root'' (''n'': ''REAL''): ''REAL'' '''is''' 
      '''require'''
         ''n'' &gt;= ''0'' 
      '''do''' 
         ''Result'' := ... sqrt calculation 
      '''ensure'''
         ''n'' = ''Result'' * ''Result''
      '''rescue'''
         ... clean up instructions 
         ... if cleanup successful... 
         '''retry'''
      '''end''' -- ''square_root''
If a retry instruction is not executed in the body of the rescue clause, the routine fails, and a exception is raised in the caller. If the precondition n &gt;= 0 fails, then the exception is raised in the caller since in design by contract, they have failed their obligation. 
Not only can preconditions check parameters, but they can also check the object state to ensure that the object has been set up correctly prior to a routine call. For instance, consider a WINDOW object. Before being able to move the WINDOW,the window must be open, so a requirement of the move routine would be that the window is open. 
Note that this gives a level of documentation that Mac programmers have always wanted—what order should things be done in. 
Another aspect of design by contract is the class invariant. The class invariant always makes sure that objects are in a valid state. This is closely related to creation routines because creation routines must initialize the state of an object so that the class invariant is satisfied. For normal routines to execute correctly, not only must their requires clause be met, but the class invariant must also be satisfied. A normal routine must also leave an object in a valid state, so the class invariant is always checked when a routine completes. (In fact, it is a little more complicated than this in the case where a chain of routines are called on the same object, but we needn’t concern ourselves with that here.) 
As documentation a class invariant precisely captures the properties of a class and, therefore, is a very important part of class design. 

==Eiffel does not have...==
Gotos and global variables. Gotos are not needed because the Eiffel style is to write small routines. Global variables are a sign of poor structuring—all Eiffel code must be structured in classes. Once routines, which have already been mentioned, are the concept needed to do away with global variables since once routines give controlled access to shared information. Eiffel also does not need type casts to make up for a flawed type system and, like Java, does not have pointers with their associated problems.
Eiffel also does not have #includes, imports, or separate interface (or header) files. #includes and imports are provided in the inheritance mechanism, so there is no need for these, with the frustration of ensuring the correct #includes or imports are present in every file. Interface files can be generated by the Eiffel short tool.

==The Inner (outside) world==
In order to interface to existing software or low-level (inner) software, Eiffel provides external routines. These too can be guarded with pre- and postconditions. The only difference between a normal routine and an external routine is that the do section is replaced by the external keyword and some information on how to link to the external software, but has no instructions.
The Cocoa and Carbon libraries on OS X make extensive use of the external feature to interface. Eiffel Carbon has been designed so that OS X Carbon has a object-oriented wrapping and so the Eiffel interface is more organized than just the raw Carbon API. 
If you need to write your own C routines either for performance or direct access to hardware (which you normally should not do since you should call the toolbox), you will call these via Eiffel’s external routines. 

==Where to now...==
That’s about all there is to Eiffel the language. The rest is up to you by using good design of software that Eiffel will help you with, more than any other language, and intelligent use of the Eiffel libraries such as EiffelBase and Cocoa that give you the features that other languages have built in. If you are writing Eiffel on the Macintosh, a very good place to start is to study the Eiffel Carbon library. Carbon shows all the advanced features of Eiffel and how the interface to MacOS can be organized much better than previously possible—such are the possibilities when using Eiffel to design, write and organize your software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fungi and lichen are rarely thought of as being part of a garden – being considered weeds if at all, though lichen especially can play a role, notably in weathering or conveying age, particularly on stone surfaces (walls and borders) and in rock gardens.

      <comment>/* Hiragana Lessons */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==
ひらがな (hiragana) is mostly used for native Japanese words and writing.  The syllabary contains 5 vowels, 14 simple consonants, and 12 &quot;compound&quot; consonants.

=== Voiced and Plosive ===
The [[w:dakuten|dakuten]] (濁点 turbid sound) symbol, ゛, which looks like two slash marks from the left to right just at the top-right-hand corner of a syllabary indicate that the preceding consonant is [[w:voiced | voiced]].  This symbol is also known as 点々(てんてん) tenten, meaning &quot;two marks.&quot;

The [[w:handakuten|handakuten]] (半濁点 half turbid sound) symbol, ゜, which looks like a circle located to the top-right-hand corner of a syllabary indicates the preceding consonant is [[w:plosive | plosive]].

=== Chōon　(長音) ===

The [[w:Chōon | Chōon]] is a long vowel of two [[w:Mora_(linguistics)| moras]] in length.

One can extend the vowel sound of a kana by affixing either a あ、い、or う depending on the vowel. The vowel would be extended for one more mora or beat. In most cases, あ follows あ; い follows い or え and う follows う or お.

There are rare exceptions where an え vowel is extended by adding え or an お vowel is extended by お. Some examples of this include おねえさん (oneesan), おおい, and おおきい (ookii).

One giveaway to an English-speaking accent in Japanese speech is the use of a diphthong for the elongated &quot;e&quot; sound (Such as the sound in &quot;Eight&quot;). In actuality, &quot;えい&quot; is pronounced correctly by saying the え kana for a longer duration of time.

It is important to make sure you hold the vowel sound long enough because you can be saying &quot;middle-aged lady&quot; （おばさん）(obasan) instead of &quot;grandmother&quot; （おばあさん）(ob'aa'san) if you do not stretch it out correctly.

=== The sokuon (促音) ===

By adding a small tsu っ in front of a syllable, it causes the subsequent consonant to double. This is called the 促音 ([[w:sokuon |sokuon]]). This kana results in a having a slight pause between the double consonants. 

The sokuon cannot appear at the beginning of a word, before a vowel kana (a, i, u, e, or o), or before kana containing the consonants n, m, r, w, or y. In addition, it does not appear before voiced consonants (g, z, d, or b), or before h, except in loanwords.

=== Yōon (拗音) ===

Certain sounds ending with -い, き, し, ち, に, ひ, み, and り (including their voiced variants) can be followed by small versions of the hiragana や, ゆ, and よ. In this case, the two hiragana are not pronounced individually, but rather as one sound.

In most cases, the compound sound is the consonant of the base syllable followed by the modifier (''fjord'' may be an example of a similar compound sound in English):
: きゃ (kya)
: きゅ (kyu)
: きょ (kyo)

In other cases the y sound disappears entirely:
: しゃ (sha)
: しゅ (shu)
: しょ (sho)

&lt;big&gt;'''Benign Diseases and Radiation Therapy'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Graves' Disease==
*'''Amsterdam; 2004''' PMID 14715820 -- &quot;A randomized controlled trial of orbital radiotherapy versus sham irradiation in patients with mild Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Prummel MF, J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2004 Jan;89(1):15-20.)
**Randomized, double-blind. 88 patients (44 orbital RT, 44 sham)
**Outcome: RT 52% vs. 27% at 12 months (SS) in improving eye muscle motility and decreasing diplopial. RT group less need for further treatment (SS). But, QOL improvement similar in both groups. Worsening ophthalmopahty simlar (~15%)
**Conclusion: RT effective in mild ophthalmopahty, but no improved QOL or treatment costs

*'''Mayo, 2001''' PMID 11535445 -- &quot;A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of orbital radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Gorman CA, Ophthalmology. 2001 Sep;108(9):1523-34.)
**Randomized, double-blind. 42 patients. Moderate, symptomatic Graves ophthalmopathy. Orbit treated with 20 Gy, sham therapy to other side; 6 months later therapy reversed.
**Outcome: No difference at 6 month cross-over. Slight improvement in muscle volume and proptosis in first treated eye at 12 months.

*'''Mainz, 2000''' (Germany) PMID 10634372 -- &quot;Low- versus high-dose radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy: a randomized, single blind trial.&quot; (Kahaly GJ, J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2000 Jan;85(1):102-8.)
**Randomized. Euthyroid patients with moderately severe GO. Treated with 1) 20 Gy @ 1 Gy/week over 20 weeks, 2) 10 Gy @ 1 Gy/fx over 2 weeks, or 3) 20 Gy @ 2 Gy/fx over 2 weeks
**Outcomes: response to therapy 67% vs. 59% vs. 55% (SS)
**Conjunctivitis: none vs. 18% vs. 36%
**Conclusion: similar response rates, but 1 Gy/week protocol more effective and better tolerated

*'''Utrecht, 2000''' (Holland) PMID 10801172 -- &quot;Radiotherapy for Graves' orbitopathy: randomised placebo-controlled study.&quot; (Mourits MP, Lancet. 2000 Apr 29;355(9214):1505-9.)
**Randomised double-blind. 60 patients. Moderately severe GO. Treated with 1) RT 20/10 or 2) sham RT
**Outcome: success in 60% RT vs. 31% sham (SS). Improvement in diplopia grade, but no reduction in proptosis or eyelid swelling. Also significant improvement in elevation, but no other variables. But only 25% of RT patients spared from additional strabismus surgery
**Conclusion: RT should be used only for motility impairment

*'''Amsterdam; 1993''' PMID 8105213 -- &quot;Randomized double-blind trial of prednisone versus radiotherapy in Graves' ophthalmopathy.&quot; (Prummel MF, Lancet. 1993 Oct 16;342(8877):949-54.)
**Randomized double-blind. 56 patients with moderaly severe GO. Treated with 1) 3-month oral prednisone + sham RT vs. 2) RT 20 Gy + placebo capsules
**Conclusion: RT and oral prednisone equally effective, but RT better tolerated


==Heterotopic Ossification==
*'''Cornell, 2003''' PMID 14513439 -- &quot;The efficacy of 500 CentiGray radiation in the prevention of heterotopic ossification after total hip arthroplasty: a prospective, randomized, pilot study.&quot; (Padgett DE, J Arthroplasty. 2003 Sep;18(6):677-86.)
**Randomized. 59 patients. Treated with 10/5 vs. 5/2 in &lt;=96 hours

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{vfd-survived|page=Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/Real Book Errata.2F}}
To whomever flagged this page for deletion because it was &quot;not a book.&quot;  This is indeed a book.  A series of books, actually, of sheet music.  Printed on paper, bound together, sold in bookstores and meeting all the traditional descriptions of a &quot;book.&quot;  I'll add the publishing information from the endpapers so that there is less confusion.  There were three collections of sheet music known as &quot;The Real Books&quot; which were unauthorized transcriptions of jazz songs published clandestinely.  Hal Leonard Publishing has since produced legalized versions of the books that respect copyright and pay royalties to the composers- in addition to correcting numerous errata.  I have addressed part of the differences between the versions of the second volume of the series, which is comprised of listing the songs missing from the Hal Leonard version.  The next tasks is to create a list of songs added to the collection by Hal Leonard's transcriptionists, and then to do the same for the Real Book Volume I and Real Book Volume III.  Interestingly enough, the page that discussed this set of differences on Wikipedia was deleted by someone because it was a book and they thought it belonged at Wikibooks... and, by the way, if you're going to flag an entry for deletion you should at least have the forthrightness to put a note on the discussion page detailing your reasoning.  That way a public discussion can happen in this public resource.[[User:Cunamara|Cunamara]] ([[User talk:Cunamara|talk]]) 02:30, 15 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Uses==
Lichen are mostly used to add a feeling of age to a place (because of how slowly they grow), and are an indicator of clean air (because they are vulnerable to air pollution). They can also add gentle or striking colors in unlikely places.

They are particularly well-suited to:
* [[../Rock Gardens|rock gardens]]
* stone walls
* stone borders
* roofs
* tree bark (either living or dead – lichen doesn’t damage trees)

Because lichen can survive for long periods without water, they are well-suited to [[w:xeriscaping|xeriscaping]].

==Cultivation==
How to grow lichen: if an environment is conducive to lichen, it will eventually grow. If it is not, then it is difficult to force it. Naturally, it will grow very slowly, on the order of millimeters per year, but with nutrients it can grow much faster – you don’t need to wait centuries to have lichen-covered walls.

If there is lichen in the area, or you have reason to think that it could grow (say, it used to grow), you can encourage the grow as follows:
* Put nutrients on porous rock, and it’ll grow rapidly.
* Add ground up lichen, and it’ll grow instantly.
* Yogurt and sugar water work as nutrients.

Specific recipes:
* lichen slurry/milk shake
:1:50 lichen to yogurt, such as 10 ml ground up lichen + 500 ml natural yogurt
* spray sugar water weekly
:1:40 sugar to water, such as 5 ml sugar + 200 ml water or 100 ml sugar + 4L water.
:Even w/o adding lichen, one should see results after a month or so.

[[w:Bryophyte|Bryophytes]] (non-vascular land plants), of which the most well-known are [[w:Moss|mosses]], but also include [[w:Marchantiophyta|liverworts]] and [[w:hortworts|hortworts]], are an ancient form of plants, suited to some forms of gardening. For similar uses, see [[../Lichen|lichen]].

Particularly useful in [[../Rock Gardens|rock gardens]].

==Examples==
One of the most famous moss gardens is 苔寺 (koke dera, “moss temple”) of [[w:Saihō-ji|Saihō-ji]], [[w:Kyoto|Kyoto]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Doping is the process of adding impurities to intrinsic semiconductors to alter their properties. Normally Trivalent and Pentavalent elements are used to dope Silicon and Germanium. When a intrinsic semiconductor is doped with Trivalent impurity it becomes a P-Type semiconductors. The P stands for Positive, which means the semiconductor is rich in holes or Positive charged ions. When we dope intrinsic material with Pentavalent impurities we get N-Type semiconductor, where N stands for Negative. N-type semiconductors have Negative charged ions or in other words have excess electrons.

==How Doping Works==

[[Image:P-doped Si.svg|right|300px|thumb|Figure : P-type [[w:Silicon|silicon]], doped with [[w:Boron|boron]]]]

Atoms follow a rule called Octec Rule. According to Octec-rule atoms are stable when there are eight electrons in their valence. If not atoms readily accept or share neighboring atoms to achieve eight electrons in their valance shell. In the silicon lattice each silicon atom is surrounded by four silicon atoms. Each silicon atom share one of its electron in the valance shell to its neighbor to satisfy the octec-rule. A schematic diagram of an intrinsic semiconductor is shown in image right (Figure : Intrinsic Silicon Lattice).

Now lets see what will happen when we pop in a pentavalent element into the lattice. As you can see the image (Figure : N-type) , we have doped the silicon lattice with Phosphorous, a pentavalent element. Now pentavalent  element has five electrons, so it shares a electron with each of the four neighboring silicon atoms, hence four atoms are tied up with the silicon atoms in the lattice. This leaves an electron extra. This excess electron is free to move and is responsible conduction. Hence N-type (Negative Type) extrinsic semiconductor (silicon in this case) is made by doping the semiconductor with pentavalent element.

To create a P-type semiconductor, all we must do is to pop in a trivalent element into the lattice. A trivalent element has three electrons in its valence shell. It shares three electrons with three neighboring silicon atoms in the lattice, the fourth silicon atom demands an electron but the trivalent atom has no more electron to share. This creates a void in lattice which we call it has hole. Since the electron is deficient, the hole readily accepts an electron, this makes it a P-type (Positive type) extrinsic semiconductor.

As you can see at image (Figure : P-type) , we have poped in boron (trivalent element) in silicon lattice. This has created a hole making the semiconductor a P-type material.

The case is no different in Germanium. Its behaves same as silicon how ever some properties do differ which makes germanium based devices used in certain application and silicon based devices used in other applications.</text>

! BIOS Tips &amp; Tricks
|-
|Familiarize yourself with&lt;br&gt;BIOS settings in equipment&lt;br&gt;that you support. 
|-
|Know your beeps you may&lt;br&gt;not have access to the&lt;br&gt;internet when things go wrong.
|- 
|Change control always&lt;br&gt;make sure you can reverse&lt;br&gt;any change you make in a&lt;br&gt;BIOS.
|-
|BIOS updates keep informed.&lt;br&gt;Don't roll them out as soon&lt;br&gt;as they hit the mirrors wait&lt;br&gt;a couple of months then check&lt;br&gt;manufacturer forums for&lt;br&gt;problems with the update.&lt;br&gt;Once you are happy update&lt;br&gt;one system monitor it and then&lt;br&gt;role out to the rest of your&lt;br&gt;systems.

===Introduction===
The BIOS (Basic Input / Output System) can be thought of as a suite of small programs that operates between the operating system and the hardware on any given computer. It provides a number of services that enable the computer to boot any given operating system. The BIOS can also provide or present other services to the operating system depending on the operating system and or the type of hardware installed. It is also wise to note that a modern day computer will have multiple BIOS chips representing the various different hardware that the modern day computer has access too. This includes but is by no means a definitive list [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_cards Graphic Cards], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_cards Sound Cards]. Firstly lets look at the services the BIOS provides regardless of which operating system is installed that being the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test POST] (Power On Self Test), Hardware Management, Security and Date and Time.

=== POST - Power On Self Test===
*The POST process involves a small diagnostic program that checks hardware for the following conditions. Is the hardware present? If so a basic test is then performed to check for faults more advanced tests can be performed but normally this feature needs to be manually enabled such as a long memory test. If the POST process errors it will always do so with audible beeps and in some cases with a visual message this is know as an &quot;Irregular POST Condition&quot;. The number and in some cases the pattern of the beeps will aid you in diagnosing the problem however, different manufacturers have different implementations of the audible beeps so it is always wise to know who coded the BIOS for the particular hardware that you support. 

===Hardware Management===
*The BIOS allows you to customize certain aspects of the system, although you do not interact with the BIOS directly you in fact interact with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMOS CMOS] (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor). The BIOS query's the CMOS for customized configurations as part of the POST process. The CMOS is very suitable for this as it has a very low power requirement. It is important to understand the relationship between the BIOS and the CMOS because any changes you make to your BIOS are held in CMOS which can be termed as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_memory volatile memory]. Your motherboard will have a battery which powers the CMOS hence keeping any customized system configurations that you have made. Because of the technology behind the CMOS you can configure hardware on your system to behave differently or configure the hardware to respond to a different address range altogether. On older motherboards where the CMOS had limited capabilities this was done in the form of positioning [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumper_(computing) jumpers] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIP_switch dip switches] to hardware manufacturers specifications. In some cases even today you may still come across the jumper / dip switch technology most notably in SCSI ID or BIOS password resets always keep the possibility of older technology in mind.

===Security===
*Computers have for a long time supported the facility to have a BIOS password set, typically this will prompt at the power up stage any given user to input a password before the BIOS would complete the boot process. Modern day computers have the facility to detect configuration changes such as memory size changes and even if the case has been removed. However, there has always been some dispute about the benefits of such a process being invoked as a &quot;sys admin&quot; you will need to keep in mind the administrative work load over the benefits of implementing such a system. Often the BIOS password system does not work due to the fact that information on how to get around them freely exists on the internet. Compare this with one of your users forgetting the password which will inevitably mean a visit to the computer to solve and its not hard to see why these systems are rarely invoked at the business level. 

===Date and Time===
*The BIOS by default will provide the system date and time upon the booting of the operating system, setting the time is a an option within the BIOS. After the operating system has gathered this information the BIOS clock and the Operating System clock become two different clocks. Further the BIOS cannot handle time zones, this is handled by the operating system. This means that the BIOS clock may differ from the operating system clock after a period of use even if it is only in milliseconds. Linux has a command called ''hwclock'' which can be used to sync the operating system clock with the BIOS. However, the important thing to remember is the two clocks, further on in the course you will start to look at ''ntp'' and how important it is to maintain a consistent &quot;Network Time&quot;. Knowing that the BIOS and operating system maintain two clocks will aid you in setting out a solution.

=== Disk Drives ===
====Naming Convention====
Firstly lets address the confusion that often comes around from disk drive terminology such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Drive_Electronics IDE/ATA] (Integrated Drive Electronics / Advanced Technology Attachment)  and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA SATA] (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) and indeed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Attachment PATA] (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment) which all use the ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment) standard to communicate with the device. The first part of the acronym can be thought of simplistically as a revision. For instance IDE, Fast IDE, EIDE, etc these revisions had changes made to the physical cables or ribbons that connect the disk drives to the computer that enabled certain features. This could be to address more disk space or speed up communications with the device. SATA was like a rewrite, once SATA came into being it was decided that all historical ATA devices that predated SATA, like IDE etc be grouped under the terminology PATA.

====A brief History====
To get an understanding of modern hard drives it helps to have some background. The BIOS traditionally uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT13 INT13h] as an interface to the hard drive, INT13h from an historical point had certain limitations such as hard drive size limit etc. Now on the other side of the interface that being the drive which used the IDE/ATA also had restrictions. We can see these restrictions easily if we lay out a table as below.
&lt;br&gt;

|}
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Clearly you can see that because of the limitations of INT13h and IDE/ATA (which we have highlighted) under the above scenario the largest drive your average computer could handle was 528MB, We call this specification [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder-head-sector CHS] (Cylinders Heads Sectors). You may recall that to calculate the total size of a hard drive use the following formula.&lt;br&gt;
*Cylinders * Heads * Sectors * 512 = Capacity
 

To get around this a new specification was implemented called ECHS (Extended Cylinders Heads Sectors) some times also referred to as &quot;Large Mode&quot;. This introduced a translation layer between the BIOS and INT13h. The translation layer then allowed a computer to handle disk drives upto 8.4GB in size we can see this with a following modification to the table above which we have set out below and highlighted the relevant row.&lt;br&gt; 
{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To see how the translation works lets take a 2.5GB hard drive with the following specs Cylinders = 4960 Heads = 16 Sectors = 63. The translation program looks at the number of cylinders and makes a &quot;Best fit&quot; with the INT13h limitation of 1,024 cylinders. The translation program does this by division normally it divides the number of cylinders by one of the following numbers 2,4,6,8 and in some cases 16. In our case 4960 / 8 =  620 which does not break the limitation of INT13h. Now the translation program multiply's the number of heads by 8 so 16 * 8 = 128. In this way the translation program maintains the INT13h standard and provides a way in which the computer can see the whole disk. We can see this by calculating the disk space at both points previous translation and after.
&lt;br&gt;
* Native 4660 * 16 * 63 * 512 = 2.5GB
* Translation 620 * 128 * 63 * 512 = 2.5GB 

The Table above needs a little more clarification you will note that the Heads for the ECHS (Translation Layer) = 128 which is incompatible with the  IDE/ATA Layer which specifies a limit of 16. We get away with this because the translation layer is only concerned with INT13h and not in any way related to the IDE/ATA layer. The next table will show how this model really looks

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Needless to say Hard Drives got a lot bigger than 8.4GB, so some other way was need the cylinders, heads and sectors was no longer a viable option. This is covered in the next section where we bring you right up to date.

====LBA====
LBA ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_block_addressing Logical Block Addressing]) is the most common scheme in use today to get past the 528MB limit imposed on an IDE/ATA disk drive. With LBA each block has a unique identification number thats starts at 0 and then 1,2,3,4,5... In order for this mechanism to work it must be supported by the BIOS, the operating sytem and the IDE drive. The common misconception with LBA is that it is the LBA itself that gets around the 528MB limit when in fact LBA uses translation. When you enable LBA mode in a BIOS you are in effect enabling translation. The translation can be the same as ECHS as discussed above or another algorithm can be used by a 3rd party. It is way beyond this course to look at these algorithms. But the point of 3rd party algorithms should be made. More and more with modern operating systems the BIOS is taking a back seat when &quot;Talking&quot; to the drive, modern operating systems now perform this function with there own interpretation of the ATA specification preferring to bypass the BIOS altogether.

===IRQ===
There are 16 IRQ's (Interupt ReQuest) channels on x86 architecture, of those only a few are freely available. The table below lists the IRQ's that cannot be used in red and the IRQ's that could be reassigned providing certain hardware does not exist in your system in orange, and those that you are free to assign as you please in green.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In essence IRQ's are used to halt the computer from processing any further information and immediately service the request from the interrupt. That being the device that is assigned to the interrupt. The table above explains what the IRQ architecture looked like under [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_Interrupt_Controller PIC] (Programmable Interrupt Controller), however it does hide the the issue of priorities. The priorities of the IRQ structure can be seen like this -0-1-2-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-3-4-5-6-7. The reason 8-15 have a higher priority is that they hook into IRQ 2, in fact IRQ 2 can be said to be IRQ 9. What we have looked at here is somewhat historical under the above scenario adding new hardware quickly became an art and a pain! However, the advent of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect PCI] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB USB] enabled a greater range of addresses and also the ability to just plug things in and go.

===DMA===
DMA (Direct Memory Access) is a feature of the modern computer to enable devices to bypass the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU CPU] when needing to write or read information to or from another device, the purpose of this is to take the load off the CPU and utilize the DMA controller and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM RAM] to move blocks of data from one address to another. Although the CPU is never completely eliminated in a DMA transfer, its role is purely to initiate the process rather than manage it.

===I/O===
I/O (Input / Output) refers to all devices both external and internal within a modern computer system. Some devices can perform both input and output functions, an example of this is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_card Network Card], obviously [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_(computing) keyboards], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse mouse] etc are examples of input devices and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_display_unit monitor], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_printer printers] are examples of output devices. I know entry level stuff but bare with me the theory is nearly over.

=== Putting it altogether === 
When you turn the PC on, BIOS instructions are loaded into RAM from a permanently available [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory ROM] chip on the motherboard. These instructions, after performing a POST, may further inform the processor where the operating system is located and how to load it into RAM. In order to allow operating systems and applications to run on a PC, the BIOS provides a standard layer of services that the operating system can use to &quot;talk&quot; to the hardware. In turn, the operating system provides standard services to applications to perform their functions. It is important to understand that not all operating systems use all BIOS services, some use their own instructions to access the hardware. The direct method of accessing the hardware may improve performance.&lt;br&gt;

The BIOS utilizes a number of technologies to perform the above services many of which we have addressed above. However, as with all things in the computer industry technology is moving forward fast. The BIOS performs a crucial role within the system new technology added to the motherboard will normally require BIOS co-operation so that The OS can utilize the new technology.&lt;br&gt;
    
By now you should have a good understanding of the BIOS and the role it performs the also you should begin to understand the BIOS and Hardware relationship in the next section we look at Linux and how it interacts with the BIOS / Hardware hopefully giving you a more complete picture from a &quot;sys admin&quot; view point of these relationships.

==Linux==
===Introduction===
From this point on it becomes necessary, to have access to a Linux PC. although some theory is involved we shall more and more be interacting with Linux. I advise that you attempt the commands as you come across them testing your understanding as you go. Do be careful with some of the commands as an incorrect switch or in some cases running a command from the wrong directory (One famous example is rm -R * from / as root is not healthy). So if you are new to Linux be careful don't misuse the root account only use it when you have too. I personally advise a separate Linux installation for the course that contains no personal data etc.&lt;br&gt;

===/proc===
/proc is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures. Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be changed particularly in /proc/sys. if you were to list the file system in /proc you would see something like this. 
 user@host:~$ cd /proc

If you are new to Linux i have provided a history in the above of the commands i typed the first command being cd /proc (Change directory to /proc followed on the next line with ls (list the contents of /proc) i will do this for the first few lessons of the course with new commands only. Once we get past the GNU &amp; UNIX commands section this will stop.&lt;br&gt;
The first thing that you will notice is the numbered directories these represent processes running on your system. Each numbered directory, has a common subset of directories that provide information about that process. The number representing the directory is consistent with the process number if you were to use the ps command, we cover processes in a later section.&lt;br&gt;
The directories and files we are interested in are the following:
 /proc/acpi
 /proc/bus/pci* Note on some distributions maybe /proc/pci
 /proc/cpuinfo
 /proc/devices
 /proc/dma
 /proc/interrupts
 /proc/iomem
 /proc/ioports
 /proc/irq
 /proc/meminfo

==== /proc/acpi ====
The /proc/acpi [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Configuration_and_Power_Interface (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)] directory holds information about power features the motherboard has. Previous to ACPI was a system know as APM, Advanced Power Management, The main difference between the two is the role played by the BIOS. Under the APM model the BIOS controlled the way the power management features were used. Under ACPI the OS controls  how the power managemnt features are used. The BIOS informs the OS what features are available and provides the nessasary registers for the OS to talk to the hardware. If you were to cd into the acpi directory you will note the following file

=== Getting hard drive Information ===

In order to get disk information, use hdparm.  More information is available at the [http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man8/hdparm.8.html hdparm man page ]

 hdparm [options] [devices]
 
 Common options:
 -g: Get the disk geometry.
 -C: Display the power mode of the hard drive.
  active/idle: Normal operation,
  Standby: Low  power  mode,
  or sleeping: Lowest power mode.
 -v: Display  all  settings,  except  -i (same as -acdgkmnru for IDE, -gr for SCSI or -adgr for XT).
  This is also the default behaviour when no flags are specified.


Examples:

 hdparm -g /dev/hda
  /dev/hda:
  geometry     = 3648/255/63, sectors = 58605120, start = 0

 hdparm -C /dev/hda
  /dev/hda:
  drive state is:  active/idle

=== Getting kernel information ===

/proc is a pseudo-filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures.
Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be changed.

Examples of available directories are:
 [Number]: Process information running on the system.
 cmdline: The complete command line, cwd: The working directory, ...

 /proc/uptime Since when the system is up and running.
 /proc/sys/kernel Kernel information.
 /proc/sys/net Network information.
 /proc/partitions Hard drive partitions information.
 /proc/scsi SCSI information.
 /proc/mount Mounted file system information.
 /proc/devices List the loaded drivers.
 /proc/bus Bus information. 
 /proc/version Linux version.

And more...

== Contributions ==
I haven't made- and will probably not make any major contributions. I will be putting some javascript versions of most sorting algorithms in the wikibook &quot;[[Algorithm implementation|Algorithm implementation]]&quot;, wich is mostly because I need to know some more about sorting algorithms for a school-project in javascript I'm working on. It has come to my attention that no one's been adding additional implementations, so if I'm not supposed add implementations, tell me; I'll stop adding.

== About me ==
I'm a 15 year old guy, and I live in the Netherlands. My interests are programming and playing guitar, and those are main things I do in real live. I'm not planning to make any major contributions to wikibooks and wikipedia, but if someone asks me for a project, I'll be willing to contribute. My username is Wesselbindt, but when you adress me Wessel will do.
As you might have noticed, my wikibooks userpage is exactly the same as my wikipedia one, except for the sentence that says it is. It seems I can't have the &quot;beginning c programmer&quot; and &quot;JavaScript programmer&quot; userboxes on wikibooks, so I'll just mention I can program in [[wikipedia:JavaScript|JavaScript]] and a little in [[wikipedia:C (programming language)|C]] here.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Medulloblastoma Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Most common malignant brain tumor of childhood (20% of CNS tumors in children &lt;19 years old; glioma #1). 550 cases in the US
*Median age of presentation is 5-7 years old.  75% medulloblastomas occur in children &lt;15 years old.
*Slight male predominance.
*Highest risk of CSF+ at presentation (30-35%)

==Clinical Presentation==
*Increased intracranial pressure: Headaches, nausea, vomiting
*Cranial nerve deficits
*Ataxic gait
*In infants: loss of milestones, increased head circumference, head tilt due to CN IV palsy
*Clinical exam: papilledema, nystagmus, CN abnormalities (VI most common -&gt; &quot;setting sun&quot; sign with downward gaze)
*50-75% have &lt;3 months of symptoms; prolonged symptoms duration multiplies probability of favourable treatment outcome of basic disease


==Radiographic==
*Plain films: often invisible
*CT: hyperdense on unenhanced study, enhances with contrast, can appear homogenous
*MRI: hyperintense on T1, heterogenous on T2, often compresses 4th ventricle
*Get imaging before starting steroids
**Pre-op MRI brain and spinal cord (post-op spine can give false positives)
**Post-op MRI brain within 48 hours
*Pre-op CSF before surgery if safe (no increased ICP), else 10-14 days after surgery to avoid false-positive findings from surgical debris
*If advanced, metastatic work-up


==Histology==
*&quot;Small round blue cell&quot;; classified as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)
*Medulloblasts are derived from [[w:Granule_cell|cerebellar granule cells]] (account for almost half of all neurons in CNS), through activation of [[w:Hedgehog_%28cell_signaling%29|Sonic Hedgehog Pathway]], likely from external granluar layer of the cerebellum
*Genetics: Loss of 17p, 10q, 16q, chromosome 11; excess of 17q, chromosome 7

==Prognostic Factors==
*Molecular profiling risk stratification (PMID 21357776)
**Excellent prognosis: Wnt pathway
**Good prognosis: Hh pathway (Hedgehog)
**Fair prognosis: all others
**Poor prognosis: c-MYC amplification
*Histological risk stratification
**Histologically poor prognosis: Large-cell anaplastic (LCA) variant, diploid DNA, LOH 17p, p53 mutation and expression, low [[w:TrkC|TrkC]] (tyrosine kinase that mediates neuronal differentiation; 4.8x risk of death), MYC mRNA (c-myc/MYCC) expression, [[w:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERBB2|HER2-neu]] positive (ErbB2+), HER2+/HER4+ coexpression
**Histologically better prognosis: Desmoplastic variant, high TrkC expression, ErbB2-, β-catenin (beta-catenin) nucleopositivity&lt;br&gt;
*Historical risk stratification:
**Clinically poor prognosis: Age &lt;3 years, M2-4 disease, unresectable or subtotal resection (&gt;1.5 cm2)
**Clinically better prognosis: Age &gt;5-7 years, M0 disease (no metastasis), tumor is not visible on the postoperative image

==Anatomy==
*Posterior Fossa borders
**Anterior: [[w:Clivus_%28anatomy%29|clivus]] and [[w:Posterior_clinoid_processes|posterior clinoid]]
**Posterior: calvarium
**Superior: tentorium
**Inferior: occipital bone
**Lateral: portions of temporal, occipital, parietal bones


==Natural History==
*Dissemination: CSF seeding, intracranial, subarachnoid space, mets outside CNS &lt;5%
*Most recurrences within two years, at the site of primary tumor (50%)
*Medulloblastoma tends to follow Collins' law (see PMID 9213055), which defines the period of risk for recurrence as the patient's age at diagnosis + 9 months of gestation.  According to Collin's law, if a patient has no evidence of recurrence within this time period, he is considered cured (e.g. a 3 year old with medulloblastoma is cured when his disease free interval reaches 3 years + 9 months). The premise is that if this tumor was present in utero, then gestation+age determines rate of growth for it to become clinically evident. Therefore, if there is residual disease after treatment, it should become clinically evident again within the same time-frame
*10-year survival for all stages: 40-50%
*For today considerable part of survivors is living 20-25 years and more from the moment of primary treatment

&lt;big&gt;'''Medulloblastoma Therapy'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Treatment Overview==
''Surgery''
*Major goals of surgery are to achieve an oncologic resection and to restore normal flow of CSF
*Complete resection (GTR/R0) results in significantly better prognosis
*Insufficient as single modality (1/61 patients survived 3 years in Cushing's original paper)

''Radiation''
*Radiation therapy is delivered to the entire craniospinal axis (deferred if &lt;3 years old).
*Dose of RT based upon risk stratification grouping:
**High risk patients treated with 36 Gy CSI (craniospinal irradiation) with concurrent vincristine
**Standard risk patients treated with 23.4 Gy CSI with concurrent vincristine
*Posterior fossa boost to 54-56 Gy

''Chemotherapy''
*Chemotherapy is standard adjuvant therapy for all risk groups
*Chemotherapy can also be given for younger patients in order to delay RT as the toxicity profile for patients &lt;3 y/o who get CSI is worse than for older children.

Radiation doses ''(full/fraction)'' and chemotherapy regimes ''(pre/post, agents)'' are varied in concrete protocols


''Overview''
*SIOP I and CCG 942 demonstrated no benefit of adding chemo to standard CSI 36 Gy, though on subgroup analysis advanced stage did benefit
*Standard risk group
**French SFOP group attempted to reduce RT volume by not irradiating supratentorium, but results very disastrous. &lt;20% EFS at 6 years, with 9/13 failures in supratentorium. CSI is necessary, despite long-term toxicity
**Based on these results, POG 8631/CCG 923 attempted to lower CSI alone dose to 23.4 Gy, but had to be stopped early after showing higher failure rate (67% vs. 52%)
**SIOP II in standard risk patients also attempted to lower CSI dose from 35 Gy to 25 Gy, and add adjuvant chemo. Neither worked, with patients getting post-op adjuvant chemo and low dose CSI doing particularly badly. High risk patients were randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo, standard 35 Gy CSI and additional chemo. Adjuvant chemo didn't work here either. 5-year EFS 68% for standard CSI
**Most standard risk patients were nevertheless treated with adjuvant chemotherapy despite evidence of benefit. PNET 3 study published in 2006 finally demonstrated benefit to EFS (5-year 74% vs. 60%), but no difference in OS. Unfortunately, it also demonstrated a significantly worse health status in survivors treated with CSI + adjuvant chemo compared to CSI alone
**German trial HIT 91 evaluated post-op chemo -&gt; RT vs. post-op RT -&gt; chemo. At 3 years, EFS was better for immediate RT followed by chemo
**Meanwhile, CCG 9892 was a single-arm pilot study in standard risk patients evaluating concurrent vincristine and low dose CSI 23.4 Gy, followed by CCNU/vincristine/cisplatin. 80% PFS at 5 years was as good as historical control with CSI 35 Gy
**Based on these results, low dose CSI 23.4 Gy with concurrent vincristine became standard in CCG study A9961, and randomization was between two different chemo arms (CCNU-based vs. cyclophosphamide-based). 5-year EFS was 81%, and there was no difference between the arms
*High risk group
**Since both SIOP I and CCG 942 demonstrated benefit for chemo in advanced stage disease, efforts have been aimed at determining correct sequence and drugs
**German trial HIT 91 evaluated post-op chemo -&gt; RT vs. post-op RT -&gt; chemo. At 3 years, EFS was better for immediate RT followed by chemo(PMID: 10661332 )
**POG 9031 similarly randomized patients to pre-RT vs. post-RT chemotherapy. Results at 2 years reported in abstract form showed no difference in outcome
*Infants (&lt;3 years old)
**Baby POG I trial attempted to delay RT by 1-2 years of intensive chemotherapy. In children with GTR, CSI of 24 Gy and PF boost of 50 Gy was used. 5-year EFS for this subgroup was 69%, and comparable to standard risk older children. However, many children failed early, with overall 5-year EFS 32% and OS 40%
**At the same time, CCG tried a different approach with 8 drugs in one day (''8-in-1''), and  delaying RT. This approach did not work as well as Baby POG I, probably due to lesser intensity chemo
**Two trials, a German and French, have both evaluated eliminating RT altogether in young patients. They have both shown it is possible in children with gross total resection (GTR/R0), without metastatic disease. The neuropsychological outcomes of these children were favorable when compared to those receiving RT

==CSI +/- chemo==
*'''CCG A9961''' (1996-2000) PMID 16943538 &quot;Phase III study of craniospinal radiation therapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for newly diagnosed average-risk medulloblastoma&quot;  Packer et al.  JCO 24(25):4204-8, 2006.
**Randomized. 421 patients, standard risk. Treated  with reduced dose RT (23.4 Gy CSI + 55.8 Gy to posterior fossa) and concurrent vincristine, and then randomized to adjuvant:  1) CCNU, cisplatin and vincristine or 2) cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vincristine. Median F/U 5 years
**5-year outcome: EFS 81%, OS 86%. No difference by chemo arm  
**Prognostic factors: anaplasia OS 75% vs. 89% (SS)
**Relapse: posterior fossa alone 32%, disseminated alone 40%, PF+disseminated 25%
**Toxicity: 25% with delayed onset mutism, hypotonia, cerebellar deficits, supranuclear CN deficits, extreme irritability, and/or emotional lability. ~50% residual deficits at 1 year
**Conclusion: Reduced dose CSI with chemo can be done safely to avoid toxicities of higher dose RT

*'''PNET 3''' (1992-2000) 
**''Study closed early due to lack of accrual in RT alone arm'' Randomized. 179/217 standard risk patients (including M1). Treated with neoadjuvant chemo (vincristine/etoposide/carboplatin/cyclophosphamide) vs. RT alone (CSI 35 Gy + 20 Gy posterior fossa boost). Median F/U 5.4 years.

***5-year outcome: OS 70% (NS), EFS chemo-RT 74% vs. RT alone 60% (SS)
***Conclusion: improved EFS with addition of chemo, no impact on survival

***Prospective analysis. 73% of patients assessed. Evaluated health status ([http://www.healthutilities.com/hui3.htm HUI3 Index]: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain), behavior, and quality of life. Mean F/U 7.2 years
***Outcome: health status significantly worse in CSI+chemo arm, trend to poorer outcomes in behavior and quality of life. Also significantly worse physical restrictions, with significantly more therapeutic and educational support
***Conclusion: Addition of chemo to CSI leads to significant decrease in health status

**Pilot study evaluating reduced dose (23.4 Gy) CSI w/ concurrent vincristine as alternative to 35 Gy for standard risk patients.  Post fossa boosted to 55.8
**PFS 86% at 3 yrs, 79% at 5 yrs
**This study served as the basis for CCG A9961 reduced CSI dose

International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) and the (German) Society of Paediatric Oncology (GPO)&quot;  Bailey et al.  Med Pediatr Onc 25(3):166-78, 1995
**Randomized. 364 patients. SIOP I low risk (total/subtotal resection, no brain stem invasion, M0) randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo (vincristine, methotrexate, procarbazine), and then randomized to standard CSI 35 Gy vs. reduced CSI 25 Gy. Boost posterior fossa to 55 Gy. High risk randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo, then standard CSI and additional post-RT chemo 
**Outcome: No advantage to pre-RT chemo. Standard CSI 35 Gy for low risk pts increased EFS (68% vs 55%). Low risk patients with adjuvant chemo and CSI 25 Gy did particularly badly
**Conclusion: No benefit to adjuvant chemo. Standard dose of CSI is 35 Gy

*'''Baby POG I''' (1986-90)
**Prospective. 198 children &lt; 3 yrs (132 &lt; 2 yrs, 66 age 2-3 yrs), bx proven malignant brain tumors (low-grade astro excluded), treated with maximal surgery, postop chemo (CTX/VCR followed by cis/etopo) for 2 yrs (if age &lt; 2 at dx) or 1 yr (age 2-3) or until disease progression, followed by RT. 
**Histologies: medulloblastoma 31%, ependymoma 24%, PNET 18%, malignant glioma 9%, brain-stem glioma 7%, other 9%. 27% M+.  GTR in 38% of cases.
**RT for medullo, PNETs, anaplastic ependymoma, or subarachnoid seeding CSI 35.2 Gy + boost to primary to 54 Gy. RT for ependymoma, gliomas local to 54 Gy. If no residual disease after chemo, reduced RT to CSI 24 Gy and primary site 50 Gy. Infants &lt;2 years 90% of dose

***Response rate: best in medulloblastoma, glioma, ependymoma. Poor/no response in brain-stem gliomas and embryonal tumors
***CR to chemo PFS comparable those with GTR PFS
***Conclusion: Chemo effective in infancy. If GTF, chemo alone provided excellent control. No clinically important neurotoxicity. However, cannot recommend for embryonal tumors

***Medullo: GTR 38%, 62% R+; of these 48% CR/PR to chemo. 5-year PFS 32%, OS 40%. Progression typically &lt;6 mo, none &gt;2 years. No difference if RT delayed by 1 or 2 years
***Medullo: For children with GTR and M0, treated with CSI 24 Gy + 30 Gy PF boost. 5-year OS 69% (comparable to older standard risk children)
**Medullo conclusion:  chemo allowed for a delay in RT in children with GTR and possibly CR to chemo, which allows for avoidance of the toxicity of irradiating CNS in very young

**53 pts tx'd w/ pre-RT chemotherapy (if &lt;3, received chemo then delayed CSI; if &gt;3 w/ advanced dz, received chemo followed by CSI)
**23% rate of failure w/ delayed xrt; site of failure most commonly posterior fossa; salvage possible in 50% of failures

==Postoperative chemotherapy alone==
*'''German Pediatric Brain Tumor Study Group, 2005''' (1992-1997) - PMID 15758008 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of Early Childhood Medulloblastoma by Postoperative Chemotherapy Alone.&quot; (Rutkowski S et al. New Engl J Med 352:978-986, 2005. )
**Prospective. 43 children &lt;3, 28% had M2-M3 disease. Treated at 31 different centers. Treatment was maximum surgical removal of the tumor, with confirmation by MRI or CT. Intraventricular reservoir (Ommaya) for MTX. Chemotherapy started in 2-4 weeks, consisting of three 2-month cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate (intraventricular and intravenous) with leucovorin, vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide, divided into four administrations per cycle, with one week between each cycle. Methotrexate was intraventricular and intravenous. Treatment stopped after 3rd cycle. If not a complete response, then went on to XRT or other treatment.
**5-yr OS and PFS was 66% and 58%; GTR 93% and 82% vs. STR 56% and 50% vs. M2/M3 38% and 33%. 
**Remission (no RT): 14/17 (82%) with GTR; 21/31 (68%) with M0-M1; 3/12 (25%) with M2-M3 . Response rate to chemo was 62% in pts with measurable disease. Higher general intelligence in pts who did not receive XRT (compared to pts from prior trials).
**Conclusion: Post-op chemo alone is promising in young children without mets

**79 pts. Age &lt; 5. Combination chemotherapy (does not include MTX), 3 courses in 7 cycles. Carboplatin, procarbazine, etoposide, cisplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide. Classified as R0M0 (no residual disease, no mets), R1M0 (radiologic residual disease) or RXM+ (mets). 
**Median f/u 6.8 yrs. For &lt;U&gt;R0M0&lt;/u&gt;: 5-yr OS 73%, PFS 29% if gross total section and 0% for subtotal resection. For &lt;U&gt;R1M0&lt;/u&gt;: 5-yr OS 41%, PFS 6%.  For &lt;u&gt;RXM+&lt;/u&gt;: 5-yr OS 13%, PFS 13%.
**Post-op chemotherapy alone can be used for children with complete resection but not those with metastatic disease or incompletely resected tumor.

==RT Technique==
*CSI
**Daily fractions: 1.6-1.8 | 2*1.0 Gy, 5 days a week up to 18-40 Gy (18-25 Gy for AR only)
*Posterior Fossa boost
**Daily fractions: 1.8-2.0 | 2*1.0 Gy, 5 days a week up to 54-60 Gy | 36-40 &amp; 55-68 (tumor bed) Gy
**Upper border 1 cm above the mid-point between the occiput and vertex
**Anterior border at the posterior clinoid
**Posterior border at the inner table of the skull
**Inferior border at the C2-C3 junction
**Plain film determination: 
***Line drawn from foramen magnum to skull vertex is bisected with a perpendicular line
***A point X is identified on the perpendicular line at one-third of the distance from the back of the skull
***A line that connects the posterior clinoid process, X, and the internal occipital protuberance defines the superior border of the posterior fossa
**Extent should be determined on MRI; plain films estimates as above not very good
**Posterior fossa may not require full boost; a multi-institutional prospective study showed 5% PF failure rate with CSI 23.4 Gy, PF 36 Gy, and tumor bed boost 55.8 Gy
*RT should be delivered in &lt;=50 days (limit in PNET-3 protocol), otherwise negative impact on EFS and OS
*Adjuvant vincristine chemotherapy may be administered during radiotherapy for a total of eight doses (weekly)

Epub 2007 Sep 24.)
**Prospective. 4 institutions in US and Australia. 86 patients, average-risk MB, treated with risk-adapted RT. RT technique: CSI 23.4 Gy, conformal posterior fossa RT 36 Gy, primary site (GTV + 2cm + 0.5cm) RT 55.8 Gy. Chemo (cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vincristine) 6 weeks after RT x4 cycles. Median F/U 5.1 years
**Outcome: 5-year EFS 83%, posterior fossa failure 5%
**RT dosimetry: 13% reduction in volume of PF receiving &gt;55 Gy; reductions to temporal lobes, cochleae, hypothalamus significant
**Conclusion: Irradiation of less than entire PF results in disease control comparable to that after treating entire PF

**Randomized. 126 patients, low risk (&gt;3 years, complete resection T1-T2, later also T3a, M0) standard CSI 36(20*1.8) vs. reduced CSI 23.4(13*1.8); both followed by posterior fossa boost to 54(30*1.8) Gy. ''Study closed prematurely due to high relapse in reduced arm''
**5-year EFS: standard CSI 67% vs. reduced CSI 52% (p=0.080)&lt;br&gt;8-year EFS: standard CSI 67% vs. reduced CSI 52% (p=0.141)&lt;br&gt;''These data confirm the original one-sided conclusions but suggest that differences are less marked with time''
**Conclusion: Reduced CSI 23.4 alone is insufficient; may need concurrent chemo

*'''SIOP II''' (1984-1989) -- '''CSI 35 Gy vs. CSI 25 Gy; also +/- adjuvant chemo'''
**Randomized. 364 patients. SIOP I low risk (total/subtotal resection, no brain stem invasion, M0) randomized to +/- adjuvant chemo (vincristine, methotrexate, procarbazine), and then randomized to standard CSI 35 Gy vs. reduced CSI 25 Gy.

**Prospective. Surgical resection and risk-adapted post-op chemo (&quot;8-in-1&quot; + MTX). RT only to posterior fossa (54 Gy) and spinal axis (36 Gy), supratentorium spared. Mean F/U 6 years
**6-year outcome: DFS 18%; progression in 9/13 supratentorial
**Conclusion: Entire neuroaxis (CSI) needs to be treated, despite long-term toxicity
&lt;br&gt;

==Toxicity considerations==
*''Also please see [[Radiation_Oncology/Toxicity/Pituitary|Pituitary toxicity]]''


*Surgery: Posterior Fossa Syndrome: difficulty swallowing, mutism, truncal ataxia, emotional lability (occurs 12-24 hours postop; can take months and RT should not be delayed)
*Chemo: infertility, bone marrow tolerance, ototoxicity, poor CNS penetration
*RT: ototoxicity; endocrine and neurocognitive dysfunctions (long-term effects of CSI)
**Full posterior fossa RT results in 5 point IQ drop per year for &lt;7 year old and -0.8 points for &gt;7 year old
**The supratentorial radiation dose is the principal risk factor associated with impaired intellectual outcome. An approximate 8-point per year decline for children treated with 36 Gy. One can forecast final IQ score based on the initial IQ score, dose of irradiation, and age at time of irradiation PMID 1517781
**Even with the reduced radiation dose side effects can still be substantial. An average loss in IQ scores of over 4 points per year for the first 3 years after treatment by 23.4 Gy. In younger children (or those with a higher baseline IQ score at the start of treatment) this loss was even more severe PMID 11481352
**The dose of radiotherapy applied to the brain strongly influences later verbal and non-verbal skills in children with medulloblastoma. Verbal fluency, immediate word list recall, block design, and fine motricity of the dominant hand were significantly lower in children irradiated at the standard doses than in those irradiated at reduced doses PMID 11104345
**Neurocognitive development and outcome of children with cerebellar tumors diagnosed in infancy is very positive among those who were treated with surgery and chemotherapy. However, those who received CRT as part of their treatment are likely to have neurocognitive and psychosocial deficits that require remediational interventions PMID 10550145
&lt;br&gt;

==Adult==

More rarely, medulloblastoma may present in older patients.

**Outcome: Substantially reduced dose to cochlea and vertebral bodies; virtually no exit dose through thorax, abdomen, and pelvis.
**Toxicity: acute side effect mild
**Conclusion: Successful reduction of normal tissue irradiation

***Treatment planning. 2 children, parameningeal rhabdomyosarcoma and medulloblastoma. Conventional photon vs. IMRT vs PT vs IMPT. Secondary cancer incidence estimated
***Outcome: RMS: protons reduced expected incidence by &gt; 2x over photons; MB protons reduced expected incidence by 8-15x over photons
***Conclusion: Potential for significant reduction in secondary cancers with proton therapy
**'''Supratentorial; 1997''' PMID 9231669 -- &quot;Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors: reduction of the supratentorial target volume.&quot; (Miralbell R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Jun 1;38(3):477-84.)
***Treatment planning. 3 year old child with medulloblastoma. Photon whole brain (conventional 2 field) vs. hand-optimized photon brain (6 fields) vs. IMRT (9 fields) vs. proton (3 fields). Whole brain 30 Gy + posterior fossa/ventricle boost 10 Gy.
***Outcome: both optimized photon plans only slightly worse than proton plan
***Conclusion: Decrease in morbidity can be expected from protons and optimized photon plans compared to whole brain irradiation
**'''Craniospinal; 1997''' PMID 9240650 -- &quot;Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors: spinal theca irradiation.&quot; (Miralbell R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Jul 1;38(4):805-11.)
***Treatment planning. 2 year old child with neuroblastoma, undergoing CSI. Single posterior 6 MV photon field vs. single posterior 100 MeV proton field, 30 Gy
***Outcome: Target (spinal dural sac) coverage comparable. Vertebral body V50% photons 100% vs. protons 20%. Heart dose V60% photons 60% vs. protons 0%
***Conclusion: Potential role for proton therapy in decreasing OAR dose during CSI irradiation

**Markov simulation, children age 5 followed for tumor control and adverse events
**Outcome: Proton therapy 23,600 cost saving, 0.68 additional QALY per patient. Biggest benefit due to reduction in IQ and GHD loss
**Conclusion: Proton therapy can be cost-effective and cost-saving compared with conventional RT</text>

== Paper Quilling ==

Hi Mellocello,

The Paper Quilling honor looks to me like it could use a lot of pictures.  Is it possible for you to take several and upload them to [http://commons.wikimedia.org/ The Commons]?  If so, you can use them directly here in Wikibooks. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 00:45, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

==Formatting suggestion==
Hi Mellocello,

What do you think about this approach to formatting for the paper quilling honor:
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=300px&gt;
image:Paper Quilling 1.jpg|1. To make a tight circle, take a quilling wand and a paper strip cut the you desired length. Put the end of the paper strip into the slot on the quilling wand.
image:Paper quilling 2.jpg|2. Then, holding the paper strip kind of taut with your left hand, roll the wand toward your left hand with your right hand 
Image:Paper quilling 3.jpg|3. Keep rolling and once you get to the end of the paper strip, put a tiny dot of glue on the end of the strip and press it against the side of the circle and hold it there for 5-10 seconds for the glue to dry
Image:Paper quilling 4.jpg|4. Now, slip the tight circle off the quilling wand and... Wa la!! You have made a tight circle.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Copyrights ==

Hi Mellocello,

Do you own the copyrights to the photos you uploaded to the Commons?  If not, do you know how the images are licensed?  I notice that some of them have already been tagged on the Commons as not having sufficient licensing information, and I don't know who &quot;Chandri&quot; is.  You have to be very careful about this sort of thing in the Wikimedia projects. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:54, 16 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The idea of of a utopia may conjure up a variety of images to different people. For some, they may see a utopia as having everyone's material needs met. Others may see a utopia as harmonious relations; others may see it as impossible. Some may see it as peace, love and brother hood between all individuals.

This section will explore a variety of ideologies and belief systems with respect to how Utopian ideals fit within them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To start developing plug-ins for Opticks, you need a good understanding of how to develop C++ software using one of the C++ compilers listed below. If you need to sharpen your skills you can download one of the C++ compilers and look at free C++ online tutorials, http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235630.aspx. Opticks also uses the Qt C++ Toolkit for much of its functionality. Qt is free for non-commercial use. You can find out information about using Qt at http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/index.html. The free version is a little bit harder to configure, especially with Visual C++ Express, but this [http://wiki.qgis.org/qgiswiki/Building_QT_4_with_Visual_C%2B%2B_2005 link] has some great information about how to use Qt with Visual C++. 

Once you have a good understanding of C++ and Qt, you need some basics: a computer, a C++ compiler, Python, the Opticks software, and the Opticks Software Development Kit (SDK). 

===The Computer===
Opticks supports most modern computers running Windows XP and Windows XP x64 (64-bit windows). Opticks also supports Sun SPARC-based computers running Solaris 10. If you are going to use larger files or need support for visualization plug-ins we recommend a modern nVidia graphics card as well and Windows XP 64-bit. Below is a table showing the minimum configuration:

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Windows&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Solaris&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Processor&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dual-Processor 2GHz Intel/AMD Processor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dual-Processor 1.6 GHz UltraSPARC IIIi&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RAM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2 GB RAM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4 GB RAM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;th&gt;Video Card&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;nVidia Quadro Video Card with 256MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;SUN XVR-1200 with Open GL 1.5 or later&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Hard Drive&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5 GB or more of free disk space.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5 GB or more of free disk space.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Mouse&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3 Button Mouse with Scroll Wheel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3 Button Mouse with Scroll Wheel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

===Opticks===
If you haven't already downloaded the Opticks software, download and install the appropriate version for your computer: [https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/141/opticks-4.2.0-windows-32Bit.zip Windows 32-bit], [https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/142/opticks-4.2.0-windows-64Bit.zip Windows 64-bit], and [https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/140/opticks-4.2.0-sol10-sparc.tar.bz2 Solaris SPARC].

===The C++ Compiler===
To create Opticks plug-ins you need a C++ compiler. Currently Opticks recommends Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition for Windows and Sun Studio 10 for Solaris SPARC development. Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition works but is more difficult to use and has limitations. Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition usually costs around $500. Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and Sun Studio 10 are free. Based on your computer and the cost, install one of the following C++ compilers:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition (Windows)
** [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B2C27A7F-D875-47D5-B226-E2578A116E12&amp;displaylang=en Download &amp; Install Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition 90-Day Trial]
** If you have Windows Vista, [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=90E2942D-3AD1-4873-A2EE-4ACC0AACE5B6&amp;displaylang=en Download &amp; Install Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 Update for Windows Vista]

* Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition (Windows)
** [http://www.microsoft.com/express/2005/ Download &amp; Install Visual C++ Express Edition]

** If you have Windows Vista, [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=90e2942d-3ad1-4873-a2ee-4acc0aace5b6&amp;displaylang=en Download &amp; Install Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1 Update for Windows Vista]

* Sun Studio 10 (Solaris SPARC)
** [http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/ Download &amp; Install]

===Python===
Python is a great scripting language and is necessary for multiple tasks to automate developing Opticks plug-ins. 

* Python 2.5 or higher from ActiveState - [http://www.activestate.com/store/freedownload.aspx?prdGuid=b08b04e0-6872-4d9d-a722-7a0c2dea2758 Download &amp; Install]

===The Opticks Software Development Kit===
The Opticks Software Development Kit (SDK) contains the libraries necessary for developing plug-ins, the source code for several sample plug-ins, and Opticks API documentation. The Windows SDK supports development for both Windows 32-bit and Windows 64-bit plug-ins. 

Installation for the Windows
* Download the [https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/145/opticks-sdk-4.2.0-windows.zip Window SDK] zip archive file.
* Unzip the file into a location such as &quot;c:\develop\opticks&quot; using windows explorer or WinZip. 
* Download the [https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/143/opticks-sdk-4.2.0-dependencies.zip library dependencies] zip archive file.
* Unzip the file into a location such as &quot;c:\develop\Dependencies&quot; using windows explorer or WinZip. 
* Open a command prompt and type &quot;cd c:\develop\Dependencies&quot; to change to the directory of the dependencies. 
* Type &quot;python dependencies.py&quot; and python will start downloading and uncompressing the dependencies. 
* Create an OPTICKSDEPENDENCIES environment variable at the Dependencies folder so the build system can find the installed dependencies.

Installation for the Solaris
* Download the [https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/144/opticks-sdk-4.2.0-sol10-sparc.tar.bz2 Solaris SDK] bzip2 compressed tar file. 
* Decompressed the file into a location such as &quot;~/develop/opticks&quot;.
* Download the [https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/143/opticks-sdk-4.2.0-dependencies.zip library dependencies] zip archive file.
* Decompressed the file into a location such as &quot;~/develop/Dependencies&quot;.
* Create an OPTICKSDEPENDENCIES environment variable at the Dependencies folder so the build system can find the installed dependencies.

Qt is the only dependency that is not part of the download, this is because Qt can either be licensed commercially or under the terms of the GPL license. First you need to determine if Qt will be used under the commercial or GPL license, this depends on the type of development you will be doing with Opticks. Please review the developer FAQ for Qt available at http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/faq to determine under which license you will be using Qt.

If Qt will be used under the open-source or GPL license, follow the instructions below:
* Download a pre-built binary of Qt 4.3.4 Open-Source edition available on the Opticks website at: https://opticks.ballforge.net/files/documents/8/112/Qt-4.3.4-opensource.zip.
* Put the downloaded .zip file into your OPTICKSDEPENDENCIES\packages folder.  This assumes you have followed the above instructions on downloading the other required dependencies for Opticks. Rename the download .zip file from Qt-4.3.4-opensource.zip to Qt-4.3.4.zip
* Run &quot;python dependencies.py&quot; on the command-line.  This will deploy your Qt 4.3.4 open-source edition binaries to the proper locations.

If Qt will be used under the commercial Qt license, follow the instructions below:
* Once you have purchased a commercial license, download the Qt 4.3.4 source code binaries for the Windows platform.
* Use the prebuilt binaries from TrollTech or [[/Building Qt From Source|follow these instructions]] on how to build Qt from the source code.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Building an Opticks plug-in is fairly easy. The SDK contains a number of tutorials and sample plug-ins to get you started. When compiling a plug-in you need to add the following directories to your include path.

* C:\Development\Opticks\4.1.0\application\Interfaces
* C:\Development\Opticks\4.1.0\application\PlugInUtilities\Interfaces
* C:\Development\Opticks\4.1.0\application\PlugInLib

The following directories need to be added to your library path.
* C:\Development\Opticks\4.1.0\Build\Binaries-Win32-Release\lib
This should be changed to the appropriate Binaries-* directory which corresponds to the platform you are targeting.

Link with the following libraries. (these are windows names, use .so for Solaris)

* PlugInLib.lib
* PlugInUtilities.lib

Windows requires an export definition file. This is located at C:\Development\Opticks\4.1.0\application\PlugInManager\PlugInModule.def

In addition, you may need to add one or more third party libraries to the include an library paths. These are located in the C:\Development\Opticks\Dependencies directory. Common libraries needed include boost, qt, and xerces.

Compile the plug-in as a .dll (or .so on Solaris) and copy the resulting file to the PlugIns directory in your Opticks install. Note that you must compile your plug-in in release mode on Windows in order to place it in this location. Debug build must use the binaries located in C:\Development\Opticks\4.1.0\Build\Binaries-Win32-Debug.

Restart Opticks and your plug-in should load. The Opticks SDK provides a more complete build system which we suggest you use. It is more resistant to changes in the SDK, allows for location independent development, and eases configuration for of third party libraries. The rest of this chapter talks about the advanced build system.

==Visual Studio Environment==
On Windows, the first thing a new developer must do to properly setup their Visual Studio development environment is to create these three environment variables.  The OPTICKS_HOME and OPTICKS_INSTALL point to the location of the OPTICKS release.  The OPTICKDEPENDENCIES variable points to the location of the libraries Opticks depends on.  To create environment variables right click on the My Computer icon on your Desktop and select properties.  From the properties dialog go to the advanced tab and click on the Environment Variables button.  Add a new user environment variable by clicking on the new button under the user environment variables section.  

 OPTICKS_HOME = C:\develop\Opticks\4.1.0
 OPTICKSDEPENDENCIES = C:\develop\Dependencies\4.1.0

*Run the Opticks.exe under the Toolkit\Build\Binaries-&quot;platform&quot;-&quot;config&quot;\Bin directory. &quot;platform&quot; is win32 or x64 and &quot;config is debug or release.  When running the Visual Studio debugger select the debug version matching your platform.
*The first time running Opticks under any platform you must modify the plug-in path setting.  
*Once Opticks starts up, go to the Tools\Options menu, select File Locations, click on the cell next to the plug-in path.  Select the browse button that becomes active in the selected cell.&lt;br/&gt;Change the plug-in path to: Toolkit\Build\Binaries-&quot;platform&quot;-&quot;config&quot;\PlugIns directory where &quot;platform&quot; and &quot;config&quot; match your configuration. Click Ok to accept the change and close the Options dialog.  Click OK on the following message.  Shutdown Opticks (File\Exit).
* You should now have a properties file in your C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data\Opticks directory matching the configuration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This sections describes some of the main concepts for working with Opticks. The first section describes the plug-in architecture. 

==Plug-In Architecture==
The Opticks plug-in architecture enables developers to easily add capability for import, processing, and export of remote sensing data.  Upon startup, Opticks scans the plug-in directory for Opticks plug-ins. Any new plug-ins are automatically registered and the functionality becomes available for use. As new plug-ins become available, the Opticks main application doesn't need to be updated. This enables multiple teams of developers to quickly, independently create capability. 

[[Image:OpticksPlug-InArchitecture.png|right|frame|Opticks Plug-In Architecture]]As shown in the diagram on the right, the plug-in architecture is made up of the Opticks main application, modules, and plug-ins. A module packages one or more plug-ins in a DLL or shared object and defines the interface through which Opticks will load a plug-in. A module is also a convenient place to put code that is shared by more than one plug-in. For example, the diagram shows the NITF importer and exporter in the same module since they share code to read and write the NITF file format. 

A plug-in is implemented as a C++ class.  To create a plug-in you simply inherit from one of several pre-defined plug-in class types and add your own capability. The following table shows the basic plug-in types:

*'''Algorithm''' - A general processing and exploitation algorithm.
*'''Exporter''' - A plug-in to save data.
*'''Georeference''' - A plug-in that supports adding a new type of georeferencing algorithm.
*'''Importer''' - A plug-in used to load data.
*'''Interpreter''' - Scripting language support.
*'''RasterPager''' - A plug-in for dynamically requesting raster &quot;pixel&quot; data.
*'''Viewer''' - A plug-in that supports basic modeless dialogs.

As shown in the diagram, Opticks provides common services to the plug-ins. These are all accessed through the commmon Service class. ApplicationServices, DesktopServices, ModelServices, and PlugInManagerServices are some of the main services. Check the Service documentation for a full list.  Each of the services are obtained in the same way and provides methods for the plug-in to communicate with Opticks.

* '''ApplicationServices''' provides access to configuration settings and session information.  
* '''DesktopServices''' gives access to Opticks’s main display mechanisms  It provides capability to create workspace windows, dockable windows, and toolbars.
* '''ModelServices''' provides access to data elements within the active session.  
* '''PlugInManagerServices''' provides plug-ins with the ability to access other available plug-ins.

===ModuleManager===
Modules are implemented through the ModuleManager class.  The class is declared in the ModuleManager.h header file included in the ‘include’ directory with the Opticks software development kit (SDK).  A default implementation is provided in the ModuleManager.cpp source file.  The plug-in developer should take the default ModuleManager.cpp source file provided and modify it to describe the module being developed.  The ModuleManager.h header file should not be modified.

There are module setting variables that are declared in ModuleManager.h and defined in ModuleManager.cpp that describe the module. These modules settings include module name, version, description, and a unique module identifier string. The ModuleManager also has a method called getPlugIn().  This method is used by Opticks to get the  plug-in class.  This method takes an index as an argument that specifies which plug-in should be returned, with zero indicating the first plug-in.  The implementation of getPlugIn() in the default ModuleManager.cpp source file should be edited to create and return your plug-ins.  The code snippet below shows a possible implementation of the getPlugIn() method for a module containing two plug-ins: an importer and an exporter.

 PlugIn* ModuleManager::getPlugIn(unsigned long plugInNumber)
 {
   PlugIn* pPlugIn = NULL;
   switch (plugInNumber)
   {
     case 0:	// Get importer plug-in
       pPlugIn = new NitfImporter();
       break;
     case 1:	// Get exporter plug-in
       pPlugIn = new NitfExporter();
       break;
     default:
       break;
   }
   return pPlugIn;
 }

Each plug-in shouldn't be in its own module, too many modules can significantly increase the Opticks load time.

===Plug-Ins===
A plug-in can be started in either interactive mode or batch mode. A plug-in executed in interactive mode typically uses a dialog to request information from the user.  The user inputs are then used for further execution of the plug-in.  On the contrary, a plug-in executed in batch mode should not have user interface components to obtain necessary input from the user, but rather should require those inputs to be present in the plug-in’s input argument list.  This means that the plug-in may have different number of arguments in interactive mode and batch mode.

Shell classes are built for each plug-in type. These shell classes can be used as a starting point to create a plug-in. AlgorithmShell, ExporterShell, GeoreferenceShell, ImporterShell, InterpreterShell, RasterPagerShell, and ViewerShell are a few examples. The shell implements common functionality for that plug-in type. For example, the diagram below shows the NITF Exporter inheriting from the ExporterShell class. The ExporterShell implements many of the common methods. The plug-in developer should inherit from the shell class, overload the methods, and use the Opticks Services to implement their unique functionality.

[[Image:OpticksMyPlug-InClassDiagram.png|right|frame|To creating a plug-in, inherit from one of the shell classes]]Most shell classes inherit from the PlugIn and Executable interfaces. These common plug-in interfaces provide the Opticks with a standard way of interacting with the plug-in. PlugIn provides a common class used to describe the plug-in. This includes information like plug-in name, version, description, and menu location. Executable is a very powerful common interface that enables all plug-ins to be called in a common way. 

The Executable interface enables Opticks to determine plug-in input and output parameters, to specify whether the plug-in is going to be run in batch or interactive mode, and to execute the plug-in. This interface enables the analyst to use the Opticks Wizard Builder to chain together algorithms and automate common tasks. 

 class Executable {
   ...
   bool setBatch() = 0;
   bool setInteractive() = 0;
 
   bool getInputSpecification(PlugInArgList*&amp; pArgList) = 0;
   bool getOutputSpecification(PlugInArgList*&amp; pArgList) = 0; 
 
   bool execute(PlugInArgList* pInArgList, PlugInArgList* pOutArgList) = 0;
   bool abort() = 0;
   ...
 }

The getInputSpecification() and getOutputSpecification() methods specify the input and output parameters of a plug-in. The setBatch() and setInteractive() methods serve two purposes, to inform the plug-in that it should be executed in batch mode or interactive mode and to query whether the mode is supported by the plug-in. The execute() method starts the plug-in and can be called by Opticks or by another plug-in.  The abort() method is called by the Opticks when the user clicks the Cancel button in the progress dialog or it can be called by another plug-in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Not quite canon ==

A recent editor commented that Dawlish's first name, as per interview with the author, is John, and that he has a fondness for chipotle. While this sort of detail is entertaining, it has nothing to do with understanding his character, and is not present in the seven books of the series. It seems more that it is a last-minute invention, created only in response to the questions of the fans. As it is not the sort of well-thought-out character trait that would help with the story, we feel it is better left out.

== NEWTs ==

An anonymous editor added a paragraph containing the phrase: &quot;Of course, having gotten an &quot;Outstanding&quot; (the highest possible grade), on ALL of the N.E.W.T.s,&quot; 

I do not recall anywhere in the books where this was mentioned. I could be wrong; there is a lot of material in the books, and I'm sure that a few facts will have slipped by. I have commented that line out for now, with the hope that whoever put it in will come back and let me know where they got that information from.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the 1950's the majority of LEDCs have been transformed from Rural to Urban societies. Many have switched from supporting themselves through agriculture to '''earning a wage from factory work or service job.'''

This was a typical social/economical upheaval in the 20th century.

Urbanisation in MEDC has slowed whereas in LEDCs it has increased dramatically. However this is not true everywhere. For example in 1980 - Latin America slowed down, yet Asia and Africas urbanisation continued.

Big megacities in LEDCs are São Paulo, Brazil and Mexico City, Mexico.

&lt;u&gt;Causes of Urbanisation in LEDC&lt;/u&gt;
# Rapid populational growth, for example, in 1950, Kenya had a population of 5.4 million, by 1995 it had risen to 28.3 million.
# Modernisation of technology, in agriculture, this signifies that fewer workers were needed on the farms, leading many to move to the cities in search of opportunities.
# General pull factors for LEDC Cities. Cities provided a chance for higher standard of living, more and better job opportunities, easier access to services and infrastructures (entertainment, health and transportation for instance).

The leaves and branches are alternate, with each node somewhat swollen and covered by a thin sheath (the old genus name &quot;''Polygonum''&quot; roughly means &quot;many-knees&quot;). 

Pinkweeds have a fibrous root ststem and may root at the nodes where the stems touch the ground. Grubbing out is generally easy, and cultivators may be used on young plants.

With the exception of the young seedlings, plants should be composted only in hot systems, since the plants can continue to grow and/or set seed in cold piles. 

Some species of ''Persicaria'' are grown as garden plants as well, though these species tend to look quite different from the weedy types.

{| cellpadding=&quot;15&quot;
 | valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;|'''''Ambrosia artemisiifolia''''' (Common Ragweed) is an annual native plant which emerges from any exposed soil in mid-spring. Leaves are opposite and finely dissected. The root consists of a thick white taproot, developing axillary hairs as the season goes on.

The plants are easily grubbed, and can be composted safely until flowers are produced in summer (the small yellow flowers are held on terminal green spikes). 

Young plants can sometimes be mistaken for seedlings of garden plants such as ''[[../Acer japonicum/]]''.

Seeds are produced in early autumn, and are spread by foot traffic and wind.

== Heritage Grime ==
One Heritage Architect said &quot;do not remove the dirt, it's Heritage Grime&quot;. 
The dirt has been removed and the building restored beautifully.

Another said &quot;match the colour of the cement&quot; the fact is cement is destructive to stone. So the architect said don't worry about the composition, just colour the mortar with teabags or coffee. The Egyptians are still laughing about Sarah Edwards who had coffee poured on Abu Simbel 100 years ago. Guess what it doesn't last. These architect have amazing arrogance given their ignorance.

== Quotes in text ==
Is the bulk of [[Stone Masonry#The Lack of Writing on Building Construction]] a quote from John Fitchen's ''Building Construction Before Mechanism''? If so, it needs to be formatted properly to convey that fact. As it stands, it's unclear whether it is a direct quote and, if so, where it begins. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:53, 23 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mixing molecules in a solute is a crucial operation for biological analysis or chemical reactions.
We will see in this chapter a specificity of microfluidics: mixing is long.

== Origin of diffusion in a liquid: brownian motion ==

In a liquid all molecules are agitated due to their temperature. A big molecule embedded in a liquid is thus subject to continuous water impacts by neighbour molecules. This impacts are random and produces step motion in random directions.

To understand the effect of this random motion, we consider a 1D model (along one axis) 
with random steps of finite size &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, that are occurring periodically in time with period &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.

The i-th random step is &lt;math&gt;\ell_i=\pm \ell&lt;/math&gt;, with equal probability for the positive and negative sign, so that the average over time of the step is &lt;math&gt;\langle \ell_i \rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The position after N steps is
:&lt;math&gt; X= \sum_i^N \ell_i&lt;/math&gt;
with an average
:&lt;math&gt;\langle X \rangle=\sum_i^N  \langle \ell_i \rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that on average the particle is around the same position.
However the variance is 
:&lt;math&gt;\langle X^2 \rangle=\langle (\sum_i^N  \ell_i )^2 \rangle=\langle \sum_i^N  (\ell_i)^2 + 2\sum_{i&lt;j} \ell_i \ell_j \rangle=N \ell^2&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\langle \ell_i^2 \rangle=\ell^2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\langle \ell_i \ell_j \rangle=\langle \ell_i \rangle\langle \ell_j \rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; for uncorrelated events.

Recalling that the number of step is linked to the total elapsed time by &lt;math&gt;N=t/\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;\langle X^2 \rangle=D t&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; a diffusion coefficient whose value is here &lt;math&gt;D=\ell^2/\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;.

As a consequence a molecules explores a distance of standard deviation &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\langle X^2 \rangle^{1/2} \sim (D t)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly an assembly of molecules (in a spot of dye for instance) spreads like &lt;math&gt;\sigma \sim (D t)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

== Diffusion coefficient ==

In a liquid the value of the diffusion coefficient of a particule of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; given by the Stokes-Einstein formula. 
:&lt;math&gt;D=\frac{kT}{6\pi \mu R}&lt;/math&gt;
The demonstration of this formula comes the solution for the motion of a particle with two main physical ingredients: a fluctuation velocity given by &lt;math&gt;m\langle u^2 \rangle/2=kT/2&lt;/math&gt;, and a friction forces of value &lt;math&gt;F=6\pi \mu R u&lt;/math&gt;.  

Small molecules therefore diffuse faster 

 Table with values??

Many molecules are characterised by a concentration &lt;math&gt;C(\mathbf{r},t)&lt;/math&gt; which is a number per unit volume.

== Advection-diffusion equations ==

=== Ponctual injection in a liquid at rest ===

=== Concentration front ===

== Diffusion is slow in microsystems ==

=== At rest ===

=== In motion with two coflows ===
[[Image:CoflowMixing.svg|thumb|170px|left| Two streams merging at the same speed, mixing in a growing diffusion zone]]
The mixing zone grows with time:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta \sim \sqrt{Dt}&lt;/math&gt;
The channel is completely mixed when this mixing zone reaches the channel width (&lt;math&gt;\delta=w&lt;/math&gt;), 
so after a time &lt;math&gt;t=w^2/D&lt;/math&gt; during which the fluid has moved by a distance &lt;math&gt;Z=U t=Uw^2/D&lt;/math&gt;.

The number of channel width required to mix entirely the two fluids defines the Péclet number &lt;math&gt;Pe&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{Z}{w}=\frac{U w}{D}\equiv Pe&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the importance of the ratio advection/diffusion.

For instance a protein flowing at 100 micrometers per second in a 100 micrometer channel displays a Péclet number Pe=250: a very long channel length is necessary to mix these fluids!

=== In motion a spot undergoes the Taylor dispersion ===

== Active mixing using chaos ==

=== Micromixer &quot;Staggered herringbone&quot; ===

[[Image:StaggeredHerringBone.svg|thumb|350px|left| Grooved channel to promote helicoidal flows. Two cross sections are displayed to show alternate directions of the fluid induced by the grooves.]]
Fluid rolls can be induced in the system by helicoidal grooves. An alternate succession of directions promotes stretching and folding of fluid elements, which in turn lead to chaotic mixing. As in the baker's transform the typical thickness of a layer of fluid decreases exponentially with time
:&lt;math&gt;w_{eff}=w_0/2^N&lt;/math&gt;,
with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; the number of cycles.

See reference: Stroock, Dertinger, Ajdari et al., Science 295, 647 (2002)

=== Cross micromixer ===
[[Image:CrossMicroMixer.svg|thumb|350px|left| Cross micromixer creates chaotic mixing with an alternate secondary flow.]]
This micromixer is very efficient but necessitates to drive an external alternating flow.

{| cellpadding=&quot;15&quot;
 | valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;| '''Lamb's Quarters''' (''Chenopodium album'') is an annual invasive weed most commonly found in dry, nitrogen-rich soils. The alternate, somewhat &quot;kite-shaped&quot; leaves have a dusty appearance. Stems are stout, longitudinally ridged, and also whitish. Roots consist of large taproots with numerous laterals. 

Pulling and grubbing is relatively easy, since the root and shoot are strongly connected. This plant is safe to compost in cold piles before the flowers appear in summer. Flowers are greenish terminal spikes.

While rarely seen in Mid-atlantic gardens, the culinary grain '''Quinoa''' (''C. quinoa'') is almost indistinguishable from the weed species, so maintenance crews should always be advised if that species is being grown in the garden. '''Epazote''', or '''Wormseed''' (''Dysphania ambrosioides'') is somewhat similar when in flower, but the foliage is markedly different from Lamb's Quarters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Open css-lr300-rig.exp. It should contain the hands (already rigged) and the weapon.

{{Important|MAKE SURE YOU PERIODICALLY SAVE THE FILE}}

==Adding Bones==
Whenever you rig a weapon, ask yourself, &quot;What movables parts are in this weapon?&quot;
In the LR-300, these are the components we will be using.
*Frame/Body
**Trigger
**Bolt
**Magazine
**Shell Ejection Port
This is also the hierarchy of the rig that will be made.

*To add a bone (in this case they will be called nulls in XSI), go to the left panel. Under the ''Get'' section, click the ''Primitive'' button, and click ''Null''.
*Navigate to the center of any viewport. You should see the null there.
*Move the null to somewhere above the trigger of the LR-300.
*Click the ''Scene'' button on the right. You should see null highlighted. Click it two times and rename it to ''Frame''.
*Repeat the above instructions for the ''trigger'', ''bolt'', and ''magazine''. Fine tuning will be done later.
*Now to fix the hierarchy of the nulls, click the ''Scene'' button on the right and click ''Frame''. On the right section of the screen, under constraint, click ''Parent''.
*Open up the Scene Explorer again.
*Now click ''trigger'', ''bolt'', and ''magazine''.
*Right click to finish the parenting process.
*Now you must fine tune these nulls before you rig them, as it will we be unwise to edit them later.
*Make sure these nulls are in the position you want them. This includes any rotation or scaling.
*If you want to move only the ''Frame'', you must select under the right hand panel, under Constrain, ChldComp. This button allows you to move an item without moving any of its children. Make sure that this is turned off once you are done.
==Assigning Vertices to Bones==
*Click the LR-300 model.
*Under the ''Animation'' left hand panel, (press '''2''' on the keyboard it should show green items) under the ''Deform'' section, select Envelope &gt; Set Envelope.
*You will get a warning dialog. Just press ''Yes''.
*Now open the schematic view of the rig by pressing '''9''' on the keyboard.
*Some where you should see four green rectangles in the hierarchy of the rig. Drag a big rectangle around this using the left mouse button and right clicking.
*Close the window that pops up.

===Rigging the Frame===
*Click the LR-300 model.
*Press '''Ctrl+E''' to open up the weight editor.
*Click the column that says Frame at the top. The word ''Frame'' should turn '''bold'''.
*Above all these columns in the center will be a bar. Click somewhere on it and drag it all the way to the right. It should say ''100'' to the left of it.
*Now the Frame holds all the vertices of the rig.

===Rigging the Trigger===
*There are two ways to rig the trigger. There is the vertex-hunting method and the painting method. In the vertex-hunting method you make a selection of vertices and assign them to a null. In the painting method you select a null and use a paintbrush to paint the vertices that you would hunt in vertex-hunting mode. For something as simple as a trigger, vertex-hunting is favorable.
*Open the weight editor. ('''Ctrl+E''')
*Make sure the button that says ''Filter'' is not pressed.
*Click the LR-300 model.
*Change the selection filter to Vertex. (Click the button that says vertex on the top of the right side panel.
*Now select '''one''' vertex of the trigger.
*Now press '''SHIFT + =''' a few times to extend the selection of vertices.
*Make sure that when you try to move the vertices, only the trigger moves.
*Now open up the weight editor if it is not open already.
*Click the word '''trigger''' so only it turns bold. (The other nulls should not be bold.)
*Drag the slider just above the columns to the right all the way.
*Now when you try to move the null of the trigger around, the trigger will move too. You can also rotate it.

===Rigging the Magazine===
*The magazine is a simple set of vertices.
*Try to repeat the same procedure for the trigger on the magazine. Just make sure you assign the vertices' weights to the ''magazine'' null.
*Please make sure that when you make the selection of vertices, you test to see if you selected all of them as the SHIFT + = technique does not always ensure a complete selection.

==Rigging the Shell Ejection Port==
*Rigging the shell ejection port should be done using the vertex hunt method.
*Do some research to find out where is the shell ejection port.

===Rigging the Bolt===
*Select the LR-300 model.
*For rigging the bolt, we will use the vertex paint method.
*Press '''2''' to bring up the animation panel on the left.
*On the bottom of the panel, click the icon that looks like a paint brush.
*Click any buttons that say '''Abs'''.
*In the middle of this panel, there is a list of the nulls linked to the LR-300.
*Click ''bolt''. It will turn bold.
*Next to the ''Abs'' button on the left, there is a palette button. Click it to start painting.
*To change the size of the paint brush, change the slider that says Radius on the weight paint panel.
*Painting is quite straightforward, but there are some limitations to this model.
*The bolt is not quite complete on this model so paint enough of it so that when you deform the bolt it looks like its stretching backward. This is very difficult to explain, but basically when you move the null the top part of the bolt should be stretching back.
NOTE: Sometimes vertices will be very hard to access for painting. If this is the case, select the null you are painting as a normal selection. On the right hand panel under ''Transform'', click Set Neutral Pose. Now move the null around so it stretches out and reveals a vertex that you can't easily paint. Go back to weight painting and paint it. Now select the null as a normal selection and go to Transform&gt;Reset all transforms.
*Save the file once it is fully rigged.
Congratulations! The weapons is now rigged. Next we will now learn how to prepare the models for exporting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Internally, little is known about Reynolds and Reynods.

== Operating System ==
From the telnet login to an ERALink server on June 16, 2008. ERALink reports:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
CentOS release 4.4 (Final)
Kernel 2.6.9-55.EL on an i686
&lt;/source&gt;

On Jan 6, 2010, a different ERALink server reported:
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
CentOS release 4.4 (Final)
Kernel 2.6.9-55.EL on a 2-processor x86_64
&lt;/source&gt;

== Database ==

The underpinning of the ERALink server is a modified IBM UniVerse database version 10.1.16. Since Reynold's adoption of U2 the product line was sold by IBM and is now owned by [http://www.rocketsoftware.com/u2/ Rocket Software], documentation specific to this database can be found [http://www.rocketsoftware.com/u2/pubs/library/100univ/univ_101.html on their website].

== Telnet Credentials ==
It appears as if it is only an era-server running over telnet (insecure might I add). You can start the era-prompt by logging in as &lt;tt&gt;&quot;era&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&quot;eralink&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;. Other users on the system are &lt;tt&gt;rsupport&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;radmin&lt;/tt&gt; both of which have installed home directories.

== Terminal Type ==

We also know that the default terminal is a mutilated proprietary version of &lt;tt&gt;tvi955&lt;/tt&gt; internally referred to as &lt;tt&gt;rtvi955&lt;/tt&gt;. Few terminal emulaters of this sort are available, one of them is by EricCom. The default terminal type of &lt;tt&gt;vt100&lt;/tt&gt; is available and can be set for the bash session with &lt;code&gt;export TERM=vt100&lt;/code&gt; if you have shell access.

==1. What was paper quilling called when the craft first began?==
Paper quilling was originally called '''paper rolling''' or '''paper filigree'''

==2. Know the history of quilling.==
During the Renaissance, French and Italian nuns and monks used quilling to decorate book covers and religious items. The paper most commonly used was strips of paper trimmed from the gilded edges of books. These gilded paper strips were then rolled to create the quilled shapes. Quilling often imitated the original ironwork of the day.
In the 18th century, quilling became popular in Europe where &quot;ladies of leisure&quot; practiced the art. Quilling also spread to the Americas and there are a few examples from Colonial times. Many of the pieces that have been preserved from this time are found religious plaques and artwork.
Today, quilling is seeing resurgence in popularity. The craft has become increasingly popular due to the low cost of the basic material, paper, that is required to make the shapes. It is used to decorate wedding invitations, birth announcements, greeting cards, scrapbook pages, and boxes. Quilling can be found in art galleries in Europe and in the United States and is an art that is practiced around the world.

==3. Know the tools used in quilling==
*Quilling Wand (Slotted Tool)
*Paper strips
*Glue
*Ruler
*Pins and Cardboard (to make eccentric coils if wanted)

==4. Know and be able to correctly make each of the following rolls:==

image:Paper Quilling 1.jpg|1. To make a tight circle, take a quilling wand and a paper strip cut the you desired length. Put the end of the paper strip into the slot on the quilling wand.
image:Paper quilling 2.jpg|2. Then, holding the paper strip kind of taut with your left hand, roll the wand toward your left hand with your right hand 
Image:Paper quilling 3.jpg|3. Keep rolling and once you get to the end of the paper strip, put a tiny dot of glue on the end of the strip and press it against the side of the circle and hold it there for 5-10 seconds for the glue to dry
Image:Paper quilling 4.jpg|4. Now, slip the tight circle off the quilling wand and... voila!! You have made a tight circle.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===b. Loose Circle===
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=300px&gt;
Image:Circle.jpg|1. The loose circle is almost the same as a tight circle. You start off the same way as you did with the tight circle but when you get to the end of the strip, don't put any glue on the strip, but pull the circle off the quilling wand. 
Image:Poof.jpg|2. Now, set it on a table and let it poof out!! 
Image:Glueeee.jpg|3. Then, put a little dot of glue on the end of the paper strip and press it against the side of the circle and hold it there for 5-10 seconds. 
Image:Loose circlee.jpg|4. And now you have a loose circle!! 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===c. Teardrop===
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=300px&gt;
Image:Teardroppaper.jpg|1. To make a teardrop, start out with a loose circle. Pinch one side of the circle into a point

      <comment>/* Optimizations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PVM}}

== Running Parrot ==

Parrot can be run from the command line in a number of modes with a number of different options. There are three forms of input that Parrot can work with directly: '''Parrot Assembly Language''' (PASM), which is a low-level human readable assembly language for the virtual machine, '''Parrot Intermediate Representation''' (PIR) which is a syntactic overlay on PASM with nicer syntax for some expressions, and '''Parrot Bytecode''' (PBC) which is a compiled binary input format.

PIR and PASM are converted to PBC during normal execution. Only PBC can be executed by Parrot directly. The compilation stage to convert PIR or PASM to PBC takes some time, and can be done separately. We'll be talking about these processes a little later.

== Parrot Information ==

To get information about the current Parrot version, type:

 parrot -V

To get a list of command-line options and their purposes, type:

 parrot -h

We'll discuss all the various command-line options later in this book, but it's always good to have multiple resources when a question pops up.

== File Types ==

Files that end in &lt;code&gt;.pbc&lt;/code&gt; are treated as parrot bytecode files and are executed immediately. Files that end in &lt;code&gt;.pir&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.pasm&lt;/code&gt; are treated as PIR or PASM source code files, respectively, and interpreted. To compile PIR or PASM into bytecode, use the &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; switch, as such:

 parrot -o output.pbc input.pir

or

 parrot -o output.pbc input.pasm

Notice that if we use a .pasm file extension, we can output to PASM instead of PBC:

 parrot -o output.pasm input.pir

To force output of PBC even if the output file does not have a .pbc extension, use the &lt;code&gt;--output-pbc&lt;/code&gt; switch. To run the generated PBC file after you generate it, use the -r switch.

To force a file to be run as PASM regardless of the file extension, use the -a switch.

To force a file to be run as a PBC file, regardless of the file extension, use the -c switch. 

== Runtime Options ==

Parrot can operate with a number of additional options too.

=== Optimizations ===

Optimizations can take time to perform, but increase the execution speed of the resulting program. For simple programs, short and sloppy one-time programs, extensive optimizations might not make much sense. You would spend more time optimizing a piece of software then you even spend executing it. However, for  programs which are run frequently, or for very large programs, or programs which must run continuously with good performance, optimizations can be a valuable thing. Compile a program once with optimizations, and the output optimized bytecode can be saved to disk, never needing to be optimized again (unless Parrot integrates better optimizations).

Parrot has multiple optimization options, depending on the extensiveness of the optimizations to be performed. Each can be activated using different commandline switches in the form &lt;code&gt;-Ox&lt;/code&gt; where the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a character representing the type of optimization to perform:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Flag !! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;-O0&lt;/code&gt; || no optimizations, this is the default mode
|-
| &lt;code&gt;-O1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-O&lt;/code&gt; || optimizations without life info (e.g. branches)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;-O2&lt;/code&gt; || optimizations with life info
|-
| &lt;code&gt;-Op&lt;/code&gt; || rewrite I and N PASM registers most used first
|-
| &lt;code&gt;-Ot&lt;/code&gt; || select fastest runcore (default with -O1 and -O2)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;-Oc&lt;/code&gt; || turns on the optional/experimental tail call optimizations 
|}

'''Life info''' is an analysis step where code and data is traced to determine control flow patterns and lifetimes of local variables. Knowing the areas where certain variables are used and not used enables registers to be reused instead of having to allocate new ones. Knowing when certain code is ''unreachable'' enables the optimizer to ignore it completely.

== Run Cores ==

The run core is the central loop of the Parrot program, and there are several different runcores available that specify the performance and capabilities of Parrot. Runcores determine how parrot executes the bytecode instructions that are passed into the interpreter. Runcores can perform certain tasks such as bounds-checking, testing, or debugging. Other runcores have been optimized to operate extremely quickly. Implementation details about the various cores can be found in &lt;code&gt;src/runops_cores.c&lt;/code&gt;.

Different cores can be activated by passing particular switches at the command-line. The sections below will discuss the various runcores, what they do, how they work, and how to activate them.

=== Basic Cores ===

==== Slow Core ====

The default &quot;slow&quot; core treats all ops as individual C functions. Each function is called, and returns the address of the next instruction operation. Many cores, such as the tracing and debugging cores, are based on the slow core design.

==== Fast core ====

The fast core is a bare-bones core that does not perform any special operations such as tracing, debugging, or bounds-checking.

==== Computed Goto Core ====

Computed goto is a feature of some compilers that allows a &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; instruction to target a variable containing the address of a label, not necessarily directly to a label. By caching the addresses of all labels into an array, a jump can be made directly to the necessary instructions. This avoids the overhead of multiple subroutine calls, and can be very quick on platforms that support it. For more information about the workings of the computed-goto runcore, see the generated file &lt;code&gt;src/ops/core_ops_cg.c&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Switch Core ====

The switch core uses the standard C &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; structure to select the next operation to run. At each iteration, a switch is performed, and each case represents one of the ops. After the op has been performed, control flow jumps back to the top of the switch and the cycle repeats. 

Switch statements, especially those that use many consecutive values, are typically converted by the compiler into jump tables which perform very similarly to computed-goto jumps. 

=== Variant Cores ===

The above cores are the basic designs upon which other specialized cores are based.

== mod_parrot ==

Some members of the Parrot team have developed an extension for the Apache webserver that allows Parrot to be used to generate server-side content. The result of this work is &lt;code&gt;mod_parrot&lt;/code&gt;, which can be used to produce web sites using PIR or PASM. This has limited usefulness by itself. However, mod_parrot allows the creation of additional modules for languages with compilers that target parrot. One notable module like this, &lt;code&gt;mod_perl6&lt;/code&gt; is a bytecode module that runs on top of mod_parrot. 

More information about mod_parrot is available at it's website: http://www.parrot.org/mod_parrot

      <comment>/* 1. What are the main uses of Tapa cloth? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|Unknown|Unknown|Household Arts|South Pacific Division/Island Ed.}}

==1. What are the main uses of Tapa cloth? ==
In former times the cloth was primarily used for clothing, but now cotton and other textiles have replaced it. The major problem with tapa clothing is that the tissue is just like paper: it loses strength when wet and falls apart. In spite of this, it was better than grass-skirts, which usually are either heavier and harder or easily blown apart. 

Nowadays tapa is still often worn on formal occasions such as weddings. Another use is as blanket at night. It is also highly prized for its decorative value and is often used as a decorative wall hanging. In Tonga a family is considered poor, no matter how much money they have, if they do not have any tapa in stock at home ready to give as a gift at weddings, funerals and so forth. A tapa given as a gift by a chief or even the royal family is considered highly valuable.

==2. Know three different ways that Tapa cloth is made in the Pacific Islands.== 
==3. Know the trees used for making Tapa cloth in your area.==
Originally, tapa cloth was most likely made from the bark of the Dye-fig (''Ficus tinctoria''), endemic to Oceania. Somewhere in history, during the voyages of migration the Paper mulberry tree (''Broussonetia papyrifera'') was introduced from Southeast Asia. The bark of this tree is much better to use, and put the use of the Dye-fig into oblivion.

==4. a. Explain the steps in making tapa cloth and then demonstrate your knowledge by making a 1/2 meter square tapa cloth.==
As Tonga is the country where tapa is still a part of daily life, the following description is given for that country. Although on other islands the overall process is about the same, there still might be several smaller or larger differences.

In Tonga ''hiapo'' is the name given to the paper-mulberry tree. People have bunches of them growing in a corner of their plantations. They are cut and brought home where the first task is to strip the bark from the trees. The strips are about hand wide and person long. The wood so left over is named ''mokofute''. The bark consists of 2 layers. In the next step the outer bark is to be scraped or split off from the inner bark. This work is called ''ha'alo''. The outerbark is discarded, the innerbark, named ''tutu'' or ''loututu'', is left over. It is first dried in the sun before being soaked.

After this, the bark is beaten on a wooden ''tutua'' anvil using wooden mallets called ''ike''. In the beating the bark is made thinner and spread out to a width of about 25 cm. This phase of the work is called ''tutu'' (or ''tutua''). The mallets are flat on one side and have coarse and fine grooves on the other sides. First the coarse sides are used, and towards the end of the work the flat side (''tā-tuʻa'').  The continuous &quot;thonk&quot; beats of the tapa mallet is still a normal sound in the Tongan villages. If several women work together they can make a concert out of it. In that case there might be one who ''tukipotu'', beats the end of the ''tutua'' to set the rhythm.

When the strips are thin enough, several strips are taken together and beaten together into a large sheet. Some starch from the ''kumala'', or ''manioke'' may be rubbed on places which are unwilling to stick. This part of the work is called ''ʻopoʻopo'', the glue is called ''tou'' and the resulting sheet of tapa is called ''fetaʻaki''. It then consists of two layers of strips in perpendicular direction, the upper one called ''lauʻolunga'' and the lower one ''laulalo''. A knife or sharp shell named ''mutu'' is used to trim the edges, and the pieces fallen off in this process are called ''papanaki''. When the white fetaʻaki is smoked brown, it is called ''sala''.

Often the women of a whole village work together on a huge sheet of tapa. A donation to the church or their chief at an important occasion. Such sheets are about 3 meters wide and 15, or 30, or sometimes even 60 meters long. The 15 meter pieces are called ''launima'' (meaning: five-sheet, because the sheet is 5 squares), and the 30 meter pieces are called ''lautefuhi''.

==4. b. Explain the process of dying tapa cloth using natural dyes and decorate your tapa cloth. ==

The ''fetaʻaki'' is almost always painted. It then becomes ''ngatu'', the Tongan word for the final product. The painting is done over the whole length, but only the central 2.5 meter in the width direction. On both sides there is an unpainted border of about 20 cm wide, which is called the ''tapa'' (in Tonga). In order to paint it, the sheets are first put over a huge wooden drum covered with stencils or ''kupesi''. These stencils are made from coconut front midribs (or any other sticks of a few millimeter thick). These stencils are made in the pattern which will be used. There are a handful of standard ''kupesi'' designs, like the 'Pine road' (the road from the palace to the royal cemetery), or the 'Shield of Tonga', or the 'Lion' (the king), or the 'Dove' (the king as ruler), and more abstract figures like the 'Manulua' (2 birds).

The tapa sheet is put over the drum and the women now rub with force a dabber with some brown paint (made from the ''koka'' tree ''(Bischofia javanica))'' over the sheet. This work is called ''tataʻi''. Where they rub over a rib of the ''kupesi'' more paint will stick to that position while very little will stick elsewhere. In this way the basic pattern is put on the sheet. Once a part is done, they lift up the sheet and proceed to the next strip and so forth. Only when the whole sheet has been preprocessed, then it will be spread out on the ground and with a brush (made from ''Pandanus'' seeds) the women will accentuate the faintly visible marks with some more generous paint, this time made from the ''tongo'', the mangrove ''(Rhizophora mangle)''. Both ''koka'' and ''tongo'' paint are always brown, but the latter is much darker. Black is not used in Tonga, although it is characteristic for Fiji.

It is customary that during the paint process lines are drawn on the ''ngatu'' along the width every 45 cm or more. The ''kupesi'' too are made to the size that they will fit in the divisions thusly made. Such a division is known as ''langanga'' and they are numbered (on the blank ''tapa'') from one to as many as needed for the whole length. When a smaller piece of ngatu is needed, the sheet is cut along a ''langanga'' division. A 4 to 6 ''langanga'' piece is called ''folaʻosi''. An 8 piece is ''fātuua'', while a 10 ''langanga'' piece of ''ngatu'' is known as ''toka hongofulu''. Less common are the double ''fātuua'', named ''fātufā'' or double of that again, the ''fātuvalu''.

These are the traditional ''ngatu'', as evidenced by the extensive vocabulary used (still many more terms exist). Nowadays for the tourist trade other sizes and designs can be made as well done.

==5. Make a collection of a number of different types of tapa cloth designs and outline the purpose for which they were used.==

The GNUmedia are creating and distributing multi-media (text, audio, video, computer code, &amp;c) in a manner compatible with (or in the spirit of) the GNU [[w:GPL|GPL]] and GNU [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|FDL]], including the [[w:CC-by-SA|CC-by-SA]]. Similarly, the use of software tools licensed under the GNU GPL and/or GNU AGPL is key to maintaining multimedia liberation.

For a more complete list of tools see [[GNUmedia/Software Libre|GNUmedia recommended multimedia tools.]]

=GNUmedia Guidelines=
'''Background'''

Computer technology was born out of a community of collaboration and knowledge sharing. In the early 1980s the practice of sharing efforts and ideas was losing momentum. Richard Stallman, taking the initiative to restore the culture he endeared, founded the GNU Project and Free Software Foundation.

GNU and FSF are cornerstones of modern Copyleft.  Copyleft intends to remind persons of freedoms which Copyright takes away and allow them to share these liberties with others. Software Libre is so named to remind us of the distinction between financially free (gratis) and freedoms which are granted (libre).  

Most software users receive comes packaged under various EULAs [End-User License Agreements.] All of these applications are released under the GNU's Not Unix General Public License. The GNU GPL is a liberating license designed [and recently re-designed] to promote software freedom. The freedoms at stake are individuals' ability to access software, examine it's structure, modify the structure to suit one's needs and give a copy of [or redistribute] the software to a friend or person in need.

==Create Multimedia==
There are a number of GPL multimedia tools and GPL harmonious educational resources available, enabling persons to learn and create or modify new and existing cultural artefacts. Utilizing these resources does not mandate that one embrace fully the GPL ideals or perpetuate them with one's own efforts. By experiencing the freedom granted and the empowerment to create with as few encumbrances as possible one might wish to amplify the efforts and ideals of the GNU Copyleft movement.

==Contribute Multimedia==
'''Copyleft Considerations'''

Copyleft allows creators the freedom to selectively license their cultural creations, enabling varying degrees of liberty for other persons. The spectrum of Copyleft extends between the Public Domain, which allows complete liberty with a given work, and Copyright, which has evolved in the last century to restrict access to culture for generations after the initial creation. Some Copyleft fails to preserve the liberties granted for subsequent iterations of the culture if allowing derivative works at all.

*Demonstrate GPL freedoms and contextualize for multimedia.
===Copyleft Multimedia Repositories===
'''Public File Repositories and the Creative Commons'''

Our collective consciousness is expanding with the advancement of digital storytelling and recording devices. A great project is at hand, to help store vast quantities of multimedia, called the Internet Archive (iArchive). the iAarchive allows persons to easily submit cultural works and multimedia artefacts for public access and distribution.

Some multimedia repositories disallow access from non-registered users. Open access is an important feature and is necessary to maintain harmony with GNU Copyleft ideals. Another important function of a multimedia repository is the ability of the users to freely move content to other file mirrors if necessary.
* [http://archive.org iArchive]
* [[commons:Main page|Wikimedia Commons]]

===Copyleft Community Portals===

==Collaborate==
Information and ideas can be amplified when people get together. It is possible for persons to interact, on a global scale, over milliseconds and/or generations. This section intends to explore some helpful tools which enable persons to share and collaboratively evolve multimedia, information and culture.
===Recursive Media===
Explain the importance of derivative works.
==='Real-Time' Collaboration===
In addition to file repositories, there are technologies which enable users to distribute content to one another in 'real- time.' The act of users directly sharing data is sometimes referred to as Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ([[w:XMPP|XMPP]]) is a communications standard for communications and data transfer.  XMPP is an open standard, allowing developers to incorporate it's functionality into software tools and eXtend it's functionality with additional features.

XMPP is not specifically designed for multimedia collaboration, it is a more general means of communication. [[w:Ninjam|NINJAM]], however, is a platform for global, low-latency, audio transfer. Musicians spanning the globe can plug in their instrument or microphone and transmit streaming audio to/from other collaborators!

=Content Management and Website software=
It is economical to host one's own web portal to display and promote self-made and collaborative media. There are quite a few GPL Content Management Systems available to be utilized for self expression and feedback. Below are a few popular and well developed systems.

=Communications Infrastructure and Mass Media=
All the creative freedoms we allow persons with our multimedia are dependent on people having access to 
said contributions. Physical and electronic distribution methods are subject to ownership, unnecessary impediment and/or exploitation. The GNUmedia are dependent on non-discriminatory, equitably accessible, distribution channels and technologies such as:
*Open communications protocols.
*Public bandwidth of the electromagnetic spectrum.
*Patent-free codecs.
*Low-cost production hardware.
*Public access to our national, regional and local broadcast networks.

''Article 27'' of the [http://www.unhchr.ch/udhr/lang/eng.htm Universal Declaration of Human Rights] states:
&quot;Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.&quot; 

We are all 'standing on the shoulders of giants' and it is senseless for our ideas and technology to be 'owned' and monetized by a narrow margin of the global population. Universal access to our mediums of expression is essential for an empirical understanding of our population and cultures to emerge. It is important that we  also aspire for the universal ability to contribute to and improve our culture and the infrastructure by which it is distributed.

{| cellpadding=&quot;15&quot;
 | valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;| The genus '''''Oxalis''''' (Woodbines) contains both native and invasive weedy species that are common throughout the region. Two species are erect annuals, while the third is a creeping perennial. 

All species have trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. On the annual types the leaves are a pale green, while on the perennial creeping species the leaves are purplish. Flowers are small, yellow, and trumpet-shaped with 5 lobes. Horn-like seed pods soon follow, opening explosively when ripe. 

When pulling oxalis, plants should always be put directly into a container (not piled) to avoid broadcasting the seeds. With the exception of very small seedlings, they should never be composted in a cold pile.

The creeping species (''O. corniculatus'') will regrow from small root fragments, so care must be taken to get the entire root. It can be distinguished from the other species by the purplish cast to the foliage and a lower growing habit rooting at the nodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">FET or Field effect transistors are device that find applications just as BJT does but vary on how they operate. BJT is a current controlled device, that is the current that flows via the collector terminal is a function of base current &lt;math&gt;I_c = f(I_b) \,&lt;/math&gt;. Whereas in FET, the current flowing in it is controlled by the voltage. 

FET is similar to BJT. It has a source which is analogous to emitter BJT. It has a drain which is analogous to collector in BJT and has a gate which is similar to base in BJT. The current in FET flows from source to drain, and is a function of voltage applied between gate and source &lt;math&gt;I_{FET}=f(V_{GS}) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

FET's normally have very high input impedance that ranges from few ohms to mega ohms. It has simpler construction and is easy to put in [[w : Integrated Circuit | Integrated Circuits]]. FET's have more temperature stability than BJT. There are different type's of FET's as follows

* JFET (Junction Field Effect Transistor)
* MOSFET (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor)

At the right you can see a schematic of how a JFET is constructed. There are two types of JFET 1. N-channel JFET and 2. P-channel JFET. Let's see how N-channel JFET is constructed. Take a N-type silicon, cut two slots at its left and right and pop in P-type semiconductor in those slots. What results is a N-channel JFET. Ohmic contacts are attached to the top and bottom and they serve as Drain and Source terminals. Ohmic contacts are attached to the P-type material too and they are both tied together and this is called as the gate.

P-Channel JFET has a similar construction where N and P regions of N-Channel JFET are swapped.

[http://wiki.modxcms.com/]

The best system is where everything is centralized so you don't have duplicates of data.
Thats exactly what I'm doing here.
If we want wikibooks to be that central entity, I think the best way would be for wikibooks to negotiate integrating ModX's wiki into their own.

      <comment>Replacing Human_skeleton_front_en.svg with [[File:Human_skeleton_front.svg]] (by [[commons:User:Beria|Beria]] because: [[commons:COM:FR|File renamed]]: rightfull owner).</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Structure=
[[image:Human_skeleton_front.svg|right|thumb|Human Skeleton]]

The human skeleton is designed for structure, support and protection. The first picture on the right shows the structure of the human skeleton, mostly made of bone, with some cartilage. Bones provide the structure, whereas cartilage covers the end of bones are moveable joints, for lubrication and ease of movement.

===Bone Histology===

Bone and cartilage in humans are living tissues, which require nutrients and oxygen same as any other cell. Most of the long shafts of bone in the body are compact bones. Compact bones have many concentric circular arrangements, all close together, and each circle is known as a Haversian system. 

In the haversian systems are osteocytes (which begin their life as osteoblasts), which synthesise and secrete the fibrous protein tropocollagen, and secrete it outside their plasma membrane. Tropocollagen moleclules link up end to end to form collagen fibres, and between these fibres calcium phosphate is deposited. Cells become totally surrounded by and trapped within a matrix collagen and calcium phosphate.

This means bone is a composite material, with collagen giving it tensile strength since collagen fibres are very strong, whereas calcium phosphate gives rigidity and compressive strength.

Living bone is broken down by osteoclasts, allowing bone structure to be altered if need be, for example to repair damage. 

====Cartilage====

Cartilage in the human body is known as hyaline cartilage, and is a translucent tissue that is found covering the ends of bones at moveable joints. The cells inside the cartilage are called chondrocytes, and are responsible for producing and maintaing the matrix where they are. The secretion is 75% water and 25% collagen, leading to a extremely smooth and slippery bone end at joints.

===Axial Skeleton===
[[Image:Gray106.png|right|thumb|Lumbar vertebra]]
The axial skeleton is the middle of the skeleton - the skull, vertebral column, ribs and sternum. The vertebral column is made from 33 vertebrae; 7 cervical (support head/neck), 12 thoracic (chest/rib articulation), 5 lumbar (large muscles of lower back attach to), 5 fused sacral vertebrae, and the 4 fused tail vertebrae - the coccyx. 

The lumbar vertebrae (pictured right) consists of;

*Centrum: Load-bearing part
*Neural Arch: Holds neural canal - spinal column
*Transverse processes: Project outwards/sideways - powerful lower back muscles attach here, requiring the transverse process.
*Neural spine - Backwards pointing process, larger than in thoracic vertbrae.
*Articular processes - On the upper and lower surface, in contact with the vertebrae either side.

[[Image:Gray90.png|100px|right|thumb|Thoracic verterbra]]
The thoracic vertebrae (pictured right) articulate with the ribs and are similar to the lumbar vertebrae except;

*Smaller

===Appendicular Skeleton===

The appendicular skeleton is the limb bones, pectoral girdle and pelvic girdle. Numerous small bones make up the ends of limbs, and there are five digits in each hand/foot, a pendactyl limb system - evidence that all terrestrial vertebrates evolved from a common ancestor.

=Muscles and Movement=

Muscles are specialised tissues whose purpose is to exert force when they contract. There are three types - smooth, cardiac and skeletel. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the alimentary canal and is able to contract slowly and for long periods of time. Cardiac muscle contracts/rhythmically throughout its life. Muscle connected to skeleton, which is responsible for movements under conscious control is skeletal muscle.

==Joints==

When two bones meet a joint is formed, and sometimes movement is allowed, sometimes not, for example in the cranium. However, some joints allow a great degree of freedom.

===Structure===

The limb joints allow a great degree of freedom - ball-socket joints are at femur and pelvis, and arm and pectoral girdle, hinge joints at the elbow and knee. Both these types of joints are known as synovial joints, where bones are able to move substantially. 

A synovial joint consists of  a capsule formed from collagen (may also contain ligaments made from collagen) lined with a thin synovial membrane, cells which secrete small quantities of a clear viscous fluid that reduces friction between the bone ends. The ends of each bone at a joint are covered with thin, extremely smooth hyaline cartilage known as articular cartilage. Articular cartilage working with synovial fluid provides an almost friction free movement.

===Elbow movement===

The elbow has antagonistic muscles, attached by tendons (collagen fibres), that contract to move the bones. Antagonistic muscles refers to the fact that they 'antagonise' each other or that there are pairs of muscles arranged so that one pair can pull in one direction, the other pair in the opposite direction.

===Levers===

A force multiplier is one which multiplies the force exerted by the distance from the pivot - but our biceps do not work like this. Our muscles use a distance multiplier, meaning that the force the biceps have to exert to lift the weight is much greater than the weight itself. The reason for this is that muscles cannot contract over long distances.

==Structure/Function of Striated Muscle==

Striated muscle is known as such because it appears striped under a microscope.

===Histology===

Muscle is formed from many fibres laying parallel, and each fibre is formed from several cells, forming one multinucleate cell surrounded by a plasma membrane know as a sarcolemma. Each fibre cell is filled with parallel structures, each banded with light and dark staining 'fibrils'. Each cell also has many mitochondria for muscle contraction, and the endoplasmic reticulum is comparitivley orderly, and is known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Their cisternae lies at right angles to channels called transverse tubules that are formed from the deep infolds of the sarcolemma.

===Fibril===

Each part of the stripes in a fibril have their own letters. The stripes are known as filaments and are made from two different proteins - myosin and actin. Myosin forms the thick filaments and each filament is made up of many of them lieing side by side. Each myosin molecule has a head, and the filaments branch out from the 'M' line where the tails meet.

Actin forms the thin filaments, and is a globular protein that links up to form long chains, twisted around each other forming a thin filament that's firmly anchored in the Z lines. Two other proteins form the thin filament structure, tropomyosin and troponin. Tropomyosin forms a long thin molecule which lies in the groove between the two actin chains. Troponin is a globular protein which binds to the actin chains are regular intervals along them

===Contraction===

When a muscle contracts, the thin actin filaments slide in between the thick myosin filaments, shortening the sarcomere. The heads of the myosin molecules act as enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate, an ATPase. A relaxed muscle fibre has ADP and phosphate attached to each head. 

A nerve impulse arriving at the muscle introduces calcium ions that bind to the troponin, thus changing its shape. This causes troponin and tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding site, allowing the head of the myosin molecule to bind to its neighbouring actin filament. the head then tilts through 45 degrees, pulling the actin filament towards the centre of the sarcomere. The tilting causes ADP and phosphate to be released and ATP to take their place. This is then hydrolysed, and the energy generated detaches the myosin head from the actin molecule and flips it back to its original position, pulling it further along. This cycle happens over and over during contraction.

====Force Generated====

The millions of myosin molecules acting on millions of actin filaments creates quite a large force - around 40-50N per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / CSA. The more myosin that acts on the actin the larger force is generated.

====Nerve Impulses====

So how does a nerve impulse cause a muscle contraction? At the end of a motor neurone there is a neuromuscular junction, a special type of synapse. The motor neurone axon divides into several branches forming a motor end-plate

:1. The action potential causes an uptake of Calcium ions at the motor end plate
:2. The calcium ions cause vesicles containing acetylcholine to fuse with the presynaptic membrane, diffuse across the cleft and bind with the receptors in the sarcolemma, opening sodium channels.
:3. Sodium Ions flood in through open channels in the sarcolemma, depolarising the membrane and initaiting a new action potential.
:4. This depolarisation spreads down the channels in the sarcolemma (T-tubules formed by the infolding)
:5. Calcium channels open and calcium diffuses out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
:6. Calcium binds to troponin, causing it to change shape, making tropomyosin move to expose myosin binding sites on actin filaments.
:7. Myosin heads bind and filaments slide. (See previous section).

=Effects of ageing=
===Osteoporosis===

Osteoporosis is a degenerative disease that results from a breakdown in the normal repair function in bones, and it affects the bones directly. Bone density gradually decreases, as the rate of the osteoblasts that build bone becomes less than that of the osteoclasts that break it down. This bone mass loss results in bones that are much more likely to break - it is a widespread and common disease, especially in woman. 

Prevention is the usual things - good diet - lack of vitamin D and calcium can increase the risk, exercise, avoiding cigarettes. Women are more likely to develop osterporosis simply because their bone mass is less throughout their lives, but the lack of oestrogen in women that have reached the menopause is through to contribute.

===Osteoarthritis===

Osteoarhtritis is a condition inwhich cartilage at the joints becomes rougher, making joint movement harder and sometimes very painful, causing a loss of mobility. It is due to changes that occur in the collagen and glycoproteins that help to give cartilage its resilence, slowly breaking them down.

**Brief report. 6 patients. Cyberknife RT. Dose 38/4 @ 9.5 Gy/fx

*'''Seoul; 2007''' (2002-2005) &lt;u&gt;ASTRO Abstract&lt;/u&gt; -- &quot;Stereotactic Radiation Therapy of Localized Prostate Cancer Using Cyberknife&quot; (Choi C, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 69(3):S375, Abstract 2307)
**Retrospective. 44 patients, 10 low risk, 9 intermediate risk, 25 high risk. RT 32-36/4.  Median F/U 13 months
**Outcome: 3-year bPFS 78%, OS 100%
**Conclusion: Cyberknife feasible

*'''Virginia Mason; 2007''' (2000-2004) PMID 17336216 -- &quot;Stereotactic hypofractionated accurate radiotherapy of the prostate (SHARP), 33.5 Gy in five fractions for localized disease: first clinical trial results.&quot; (Madsen BL, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Mar 15;67(4):1099-105.)
**Phase I/II. 40 patients, localized PCA. SBRT 33.5/5 in 5 days. Median F/U 3.4 years
**Outcome: Actuarial 4-year bPFS (ASTRO) 70%, (nadir+2) 90% 
**Toxicity: Late G1-2 toxicity GU 45%, GI 37%; no Grade 3-4 toxicity; impotence 23%
**Conclusion: SBRT feasible, with minimal toxicity

===Clinical: Boost===
*'''Barcelona; 2009''' (2001-2004) PMID 19910135 -- &quot;Hypofractionated Boost to the Dominant Tumor region with Intensity Modulated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: A Sequential Dose Escalation Pilot Study.&quot; (Miralbell R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Nov 10. [Epub ahead of print])
**Phase I. 50 patients. Initial conventional 3D-CRT/IMRT 64-64.4 in 1.8-2 Gy/fx, follwed by SBRT boost. 10/2 -&gt; 12/2 -&gt; 14/2 -&gt; 16/2 @ 8 Gy/fx. Rectal balloon with 60 cc air. ADT 66%. 
**Outcome: 5-year bDFS 98%
**Toxicity: 5-year Grade 2+ GI 28%, Grade 2+ GU 18% and not correlated with dose
**Conclusion: Hypofractionated boost dose escalation is feasible, with excellent outcomes and acceptable long-term toxicity
**Comment: See PMID 19250768 for same instutition, concurrent protocol on HDR boost

===Dosimetry===
*'''UC San Francisco''' 
**'''2008''' PMID 18841856 -- &quot;Simulated real time image guided intrafraction tracking-delivery for hypofractionated prostate IMRT.&quot; (Hossain S, Med Phys. 2008 Sep;35(9):4041-8.)
***Treatment planning. Review of intrafraction prostate movements during 50-70 min Cyberknife treatment time, then virtually treated with IMRT plan based on the observed motion over time. Nominal single fraction 9.5 Gy
***Outcome: For most cases, DVH impact minimal (~2%). However, with sporadic movements &gt;5mm, significant change. V100 could be reduced to &lt;85%
***Conclusion: Due to observed large amplitude sporadic prostate motion, online target correction is necessary for hypofractionated IMRT-SBRT
**'''2010''' PMID 20133073 -- &quot;Dose Gradient Near Target-Normal Structure Interface for Nonisocentric CyberKnife and Isocentric Intensity-Modulated Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer.&quot; (Hossain S, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Feb 2. [Epub ahead of print])
***Treatment planning. 8 patients treated with Cyberknife replanned with 9-field IMRT
***Outcome: CK plans better conformity (1.18 vs 1.44) but higher dose inhomogeneity (1.45 vs 1.28). Dose fall-off posterior CK 2.9%/mm vs IMRT 3.1%/mm, all directions 3.6%/mm vs 3.6%/mm
***Conclusion: Cyberknife capable of producing comparable dose gradient as IMRT

*'''San Diego CyberKnife Center; 2008''' PMID 18374232 -- &quot;Virtual HDR CyberKnife treatment for localized prostatic carcinoma: dosimetry comparison with HDR brachytherapy and preliminary clinical observations.&quot; (Fuller DB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2008 Apr 1;70(5):1588-97.)
**Dosimetry. 10 patients treated with CyberKnife. Used HDR protocol 38/4
**Comparison: CK had comparable PTV, less V125 and V150, lower urethral dose, lower bladder Dmax but slower dose fall-off, similar rectal doses, and sharper dose fall-off
**Outcome: 4-month PSA decreased 86%
**Toxicity: acute toxicity mainly GU, IPSS median increase 10 points, return to baseline by 8 weeks, minimal GI toxicity
**Conclusion: It is possible to construct and deliver Cyberknife plans that closely recapitulate HDR dosimetry

**Retrospective. 47 patients, each with 3 fiducial markers. 227 RT fractions reviewed. Also ragiographs at 6 min intervals
**Outcome: sup/inf 2.0 mm, ant/post 1.9 mm, right/left 1.4 mm. Radiographs 0-6 min 1.5 mm greatest, &gt;6 min 0.9 mm greatest
**Conclusion: Average intrafractional movement 2.0 mm or less. Most movement early, and recommend settling-in period before treatment

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Q: Should I do a Factory Reset, what will I lose? ====

A: A factory reset will not delete any recordings, but it will delete all the timers you have set. It will also reset the following:
*Transparency
*Interactive services
*Time slip

More noticeably all the channels will need to be rescanned after a factory reset. The process is described in the [http://www.toppy.org.uk/newusers/manual1d.php manual]

If you wish you may preserve your timers by using [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7049 Channel Manager] to do the factory reset &amp; rescan, alternatively [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1719 UKTimers TAP] is a small easy to use TAP to import/export timers.

When changing between some firmware versions a factory reset is essential to avoid problems.

==== Q: How do I get my remote apart to clean it? ====

A: Look [http://www.topfield-australia.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=74519#74519 here] and [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=157690#157690 here]

A: The following checklist is a good starting point.
*Check the Toppy.Org FAQ first [http://www.toppy.org.uk/faq.php?category=all#faq173 here] &amp; follow links to guides.
*Aerial has been damaged or is inappropriate or is pointing in the wrong direction [http://www.wolfbane.com/cgi-bin/tvd.exe reception predictor].
*Downlead is damaged or of poor quality or with joints in it or very long. [http://www.megalithia.com/elect/cable/index.html CT100]
*Water has got into the cable or aerial connection.
*The supplied short RF coax patch cable at the back of the box is missing. [http://www.toppy.org.uk/newusers/manual1b.php link 2&amp;3]
*Signal is too weak, 65 - 70% is normally about the minimum, quality should be close to 100. [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=78129 Signal TAP]
*Channels at the top end of the frequency range are more affected by atmospherics.
*A masthead amp may help, check power is on if you have one. It is not a universal fix.
*Planned works on your transmitter. [http://www.digitaluk.co.uk/engineering_works]
*Birds on the aerial as discused [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=158395 here]
*Indoor aerials can be trickey discussed [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=158738#158738 here]


Radio ham garbled audio interference has been reported.

==== Q: What firmware should I use on my TF5800PVR ====
The recommended firmware is &quot;TF5800-5.13.65beta&quot; with essential patches added as a minimum.


The unpatched version of the recomended firmware is linked from [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9429 here] and the patching tools and files are all [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~r2-d2/patches.html here].


Some specific patching recommendations have been made &amp; firmware with patches already applied are available to download, for example in the firmware section of [[Topfield_5800/Stable_Toppy|CW's Guide to a Stable Toppy]]. 


When referring to patches a link to SimonC's Firmware Patch Decipherer is often given, for example these are the essential 5800 patches [http://www.toppy.org.uk/~simonc/dp.html?p=HPT2 HPT2]


Anyone wishing to experiment with the 5.14.x &quot;Freeview Playback&quot; firmware should be warned that there are severe problems with the current 5.14.08 &amp; earlier versions of this firmware that will sometimes make it crash &amp; also regularly miss recordings. Some patching recommendations are [http://forum.toppy.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?p=158461#158461 here] if you insist. This firmware is not recommended even though some machines are shipped with this firmware installed.

== Brush line ==

A brush contains six lines, each describing a plane of the brush.

Format:

( r s t ) ( u v w )( x y z ) offset[0] offset[1] angle scale[0] scale[1] contents flags value

Description:

( r s t ) = parenthesized 3-vector representing one point that defines the plane

( u v w ) = parenthesized 3-vector representing one point that defines the plane

( x y z ) = parenthesized 3-vector representing one point that defines the plane

offset[0] = texture shift offset

offset[1] = texture shift offset

angle = the rotation angle

scale[0] = texture scale

scale[1] = texture scale

contents = a set of bit flags:

     bit 27 (134217728) = DETAIL.  Do not encode brush into the BSP tree, only link it for rendering/collision purposes.

flags = [unknown]

value = [possibly radiosity lighting, emitted from a surface]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|Animal Rights}}

Animal rights refers to a broad category of ideas that wishes to raise the moral status of animals beyond current levels. It is distinguished from animal welfare in that animal welfare is relatively unconcerned with human treatment of animals so long as they are treated humanely and without being caused unnecessary pain.

Animal rights views animal life as having an intrinsic value which supersedes the mere avoidance of unnecessary pain. Rather, in the eyes of animal rights advocates, certain rights currently only assigned to humans (e.g., the right to life) should be extended to non-human animals as well.

==Scope and Aim==
This work will focus itself on providing a detailed yet concise report on the concept of animal rights. Rather than providing a set of articles in encyclopedic format of the animal rights movement, the book will focus on defining what the concept of animal rights is, the implications of adopting it, and the reasons for (and against) such adoption.

The book is divided into four main parts:
# The Moral Status of Animals
# The Realities of Animal Life
# Vegetarianism/Veganism
# Beyond Speciesism: A Social Theory

The first part is dedicated to an understanding of the arguments for why we should extend moral consideration to non-human animals*, and why we should undo any prejudice against such an extension (speciesism). The second chapter deals with animal cognition, the conditions of factory farming, animal experimentation, use of animals in entertainment, etc. The third is an exploration of vegetarianism (nutrition facts, the process of becoming vegetarian, etc.). The final chapter is devoted to understand how speciesism can be eradicated within a broader social context; the method of analysis will attempt to parallel those used within feminist and anti-racist sociological writings.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Note that for convenience the term 'animal' is often used in place of 'non-human animal'.

==Research methodology==
The research for this project will be divided into 4 sections, each corresponding with the 4 parts of the book.

# Firstly, a general overview of some major philosophical works on animal rights. The two most important books will most likely be ''Animal Liberation'' by P. Singer and ''The Case For Animal Rights'' by Tom Regan. Both authors and their works will be major figures in this stage of research.
# Secondly, an overview of animal cognition, the conditions of factory farming, and agriculture. This will be the most intensive period of research and will require much peer review/fact checking.
# Third, an overview of vegetarianism. Many vegetarian/vegan blogs and websites exist, and any recipes found while creating this section will likely be added to the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Wikibooks cookbook]].
# Fourth, an examination of the similarities between speciesism and other forms of prejudice (sexism, racism, homophobia, etc.) and how it can be deconstructed.

==Timeline==
The project will begin on October 1st, 2010. The current writer hopes to have finished an anthology of philosophical writings on animal rights by December 31st, 2010. During and after this period, the author will work on the section entitled &quot;The Moral Status of Animals&quot;. The first draft is due to be finished by January 2011.

Other work will be decided upon as preliminary research is conducted.

==Project guidelines==
* Maintain an objective point of view: focus on a balanced presentation of both supporting and detracting arguments.
* Establish rigorous definitions and explanations of individual arguments, facts, and theories.
* Source all writing sufficiently.
* To avoid overlap of work, use the discussion page to determine which members will handle certain sections.
* Any changes that one feels are unwarranted, wrongly done, etc. should be talked about on the discussion page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;Games for Learning – Skills Acquired Through Gaming&lt;/u&gt;

Technology has drastically changed the way our society works and lives.  Computers in particular have had the greatest impact on our currently more efficient lifestyles.  In addition to containing a plethora of programs to make our lives easier, computer and video games have added an extra ingredient to this technological mix.  The use of video games in education is changing the playing field for the way we live and learn.  Some would argue the effectiveness of video games with the claim that they are nothing but a senseless waste of time, leaving students with a clear lack of social skills and a diminished attention span, but studies have proven otherwise.  Given an appropriate game for learning, students will reap numerous rewards that prove beneficial to their everyday lives.  

Consultant and game developer Marc Prensky (2007), developed an inventory of skills that are acquired by students through serious game playing.  According to Prensky, students learn how to cooperate, collaborate and work in teams.   This skill is gained by playing interactive games where group decision-making is involved. Two player games exemplify this practice whereby players face off against one another either in direct combat or by taking turns. Students consult with one another, take turns, and essentially engage in a whole new type of digital social practice.

In addition, students “take prudent risks in pursuit of objectives” and make “effective decisions under stress” (Prensky, 2007).  Games provide students with a safe venue to learn without intimidation or judgment when taking risks and applying new skills.  If mistakes are made while playing, confidence is not lost; the strategy is simply re-attempted until success is reached.  For instance, if one skill does not lead to victory or accomplishment of the objective, the player can deliver another strategy using “scientific deduction, lateral and strategic thinking”(Presnky, 2007).   In the classroom setting, some students may be reluctant to answer out loud in fear of making a mistake, and once the mistake is made, they may become more apprehensive to try again.  Computer games eliminate the anxiety of taking risks that some students experience.  This leads to the persistence, and the mastery and application of new skills.  Games allow students to apply skills and strategies in context in pursuit of their objective.  Whether the skills are mathematical, scientific or literacy based, their application to the game being played becomes meaningful, engaging, motivating, and most important of all, fun.  Success is attained through numerous attempts and failures, and valuable lessons are learned; hence leading to “understanding and dealing with foreign environments and cultures” (Prensky, 2007).  

==SAGE for Learning==

SAGE (Simulation and Advanced Gaming Environments) for learning, is a Canadian organization which studies the potential of technology-based educational games (About SAGE.2004). They look into cognitive factors affecting human learning, such as learning psychology, play theory, and psychology of perception, and study the interplay of these factors with characteristics of popular technology-based games and simulations (About SAGE research.). In addition to adding to the body of knowledge about technological games, SAGE also develops new technology-based games and simulations, which are then used in schools, businesses and hospitals for the purposes of education and training (About SAGE.2004). Their website, http://www.sageforlearning.ca/, features many demos of newly developed games and simulations, which are available in both English and French. 

==Free Educational Games on the Internet==
These days, there are many websites which offer free educational games for students of every age. Here is a small sample of these websites:
* www.funbrain.com
* http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/
* http://www.linktolearning.com/ 
* http://pbskids.org/games/ 

(Funbrain.; Link to learning.; Nobelprize.org.; PBS kids.)

==Educational Games for Children with Developmental Disabilities==
Children with developmental disabilities benefit greatly from technology-based educational games for many of the same reasons that typically developing children enjoy these games; they are motivational, entertaining, challenging, and have fun and colourful graphics. Games that are specialized for specific disabilities are intrinsically motivating, since they are designed to capture the child’s attention and provide reinforcements, such as sound effects and graphics, targeted specifically at children with autism (Calvert, 1999). In addition, many programs that are designed for children with developmental disabilities have features that allow a parent, teacher, or therapist to individualize the program to suit the needs of the specific child and to target their particular areas of improvement. This is important, since the broad spectrum of developmental disabilities causes these individuals to have varying degrees of ability. 
Unfortunately, there are not many games for special needs children which are available for free, and the effective games are often very expensive. The following is a website with some free information and games for special needs children:
www.do2learn.com
Children with special needs can benefit from games that are not specially designed for children with disabilities. They can play, enjoy, and learn from games that are made for typically developing children. They may need to play games targeted to a younger age group, or stick to lower levels of the game.

==Benefits of Online Gaming==
What makes an online game exciting, interesting, social or more fun than another game? Motivation evolves from sensory gratification, role-playing, personality, taste, adrenaline, sociology, immersive and engaging environments, and the element of fun. Games in general motivate ideas. Topics include life, survival, strategy, role-playing, and building relationships. 

Video games can manipulate otherwise unalterable variables. Manipulate otherwise unalterable variables. With simulations of natural systems such as SimEarth, learners can observe the effects of changing the globes oxygen levels, or raising the global temperature.

Enable students to view phenomena from new perspectives. In the simulation Hidden Agenda, learners can assume the position of a president in a Central American country, learning about economics, history, politics, sociology, and culture in the process.

Observe systems behavior over time. For example, in simulations like SimCity or Civilization, learners can observe social systems’ behavior over years or centuries. Similarly, in a Virtual Solar System course, students created models of the Solar System where they could observe the solar system in motion, examining rotations, revolutions, and eclipses (Barnett, Barab, &amp; Hay in review). Whereas most physical models tend to be static, computer based simulations allow you to manipulate time (Herz 1997). Simulation games, such as Railroad Tycoon, add a gaming element in order to bolster student engagement.

Pose hypothetical questions to a system. In historical simulations, such as Antietam, learners can simulate hypothetical events, such as &quot;what if&quot;, visualize a system in three dimensions (Barab, Hay, &amp; Duffy 1999). In the Digital Weather Station, learners use special 3-D tools to visualize weather systems in three dimensions (Hay 1999).

Compare simulations with their understanding of a system. Simulations do not represent reality; they reflect a designers conception of reality (Thiagarajan 1998). For example, SimCity is weighted heavily toward public transportation, reflect author Will Wright’s fondness for public transportation (Herz 1997). Educators can capitalize on this discrepancy and have students examine a simulation for bias or inaccuracies.

Most importantly, thus far, video game research has found no relationship between video game usage and social maladjustment.

==Things to keep in mind==
Emerging technologies hold promise for improving student achievement and teacher quality.
The use of technology within the classroom has shown in various studies to have great benefits for students in cognitive, social and emotional levels and aspects.
Technology has the ability to enhance the length of the users’ or students’ attention span.
Technology allows us to become aware of how we think and to discover how the world functions around us.

The more a student feels that their role and information is validated by the software or peers, through positive reinforcement, they will be more inclined to participate in mathematics and become more socially active within the class. 

The environment should then engage them with the mathematical concepts in such a way that they be able to gradually build up their knowledge and skills as they navigate through the environment, enjoying the learning process and being motivated through the game (Sedig 2008). 

The more comfortable a teacher is with their ability and knowledge to use a computer the more effective their students will learn and benefit from technology. 

Computers do not currently have a strong impact on student learning because most teachers find them to be of limited utility and hard to deploy in their daily teaching, and therefore use them in small doses&quot; (Atwell et al., 2003, p. 280). 

When contrasting classrooms that use technology in an integrated fashion to the child's learning abilities and interests, versus those which seldom use computers or in a way that matches the teacher's traditional pedagogy, we see a discrepancy between the impacts on children's learning. Those students who received proper use of technology often outperform their counterparts from the traditional classroom setting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you try to open a file with .stw extension, you will get a copy of that document that will be called Untitled. That's how templates work. But then you might ask: &quot;How do I then edit a template?&quot;. Go '''File-&gt;Templates-&gt;Edit'''.

==Writer templates==

* (A rather poor) imitation of default Latex article class: multilevel numbering of headings  (useful for books or other longer, highly structured texts e.g. thesis). The default text body style is courier new, which is ideal for editing, as you might spot misspellings easier, but you most probably want to change it before printing. I usually edit texts in web view ('''View-&gt;Web View'''), and zoom in a lot, so that I strain my eyes less, but still I can see the end of line, which is wrapped. (Actually if you edit that way, it will remind you the interface of Lyx word processor).  [http://home.sch.bme.hu/~zslevi/megoszt/ooo_template/numered_hierarchical_stw.stw]

There are definitely many surnames considered as hispanic but that are not from spanish language (or castellano or spanish ). Because you are including in the same group surnames that some people can consider as french surnames as 'Aguirre',Aguire ,Aguerre ,D'aguerre,Daguerre,.............).

What I want to tell you is that there are in your list many last names or surnames as Ayala, Orozco ,Ibarra,Bolivar,Guevara ,Uribe,Urdaneta,Legazpi,Zumarraga,(see 'list of basques'-wikipedia) ....,etc etc that you are considering as Hispanic when other people could consider them as French . The question is that those surnames are not spanish(hispanic) nor french (francophone) ,because actually they are Basque surnames (Basque=vasco,Euskara,lingua navarrorum,vascuence ) .So it can be considered Europeans that spread to America  ,but They dont mean anything in Spanish nor in French.They dont mean anything in Chinese either ,because their meaning can be solved only in basque and after that can be  translated to many other languages as English,Chinese ,Spanish,French or whatever you want.

So they can wrongly considered  as 'hispanic' or  as 'francophone' ,but actually those surnames are not spanish nor french nor chinese nor whatever ,because they are basque.

In that list you have met in the same group (as 'hispanic') surnames that are from 'Castellano'(spanish) language,from 'Euskara'(basque), from 'Catala'(Catalan ),....,that are present in many citizens of Spain,France and Americas'..
.
It would be interesting to study surnames etymology before including them as spanish .Some people of Spain   sometimes try to include them as Spanish or Hispanic ,.....,but Spain lost its colonies in America more that one century ago,...

Thank you very much .</text>

      <comment>Distance Formula</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Coordination Geometry can be used to find the midpoint of two coordinates. For example (8,5)(4,2). The formula is[x+x(2nd)] divided by 2. ,[y+y(2nd)] divided by 2. For this example this would be: [(8+5) divided by 2],[(4+2) divided by 2]. This equals (6,3.5), which is the midpoint between these two coordinates.

The formula for finding the distance between two coordinates, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), is √((x2-x1)²+(y2-y1)²)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The generally accepted range of the saxophone (transposed) is Bb to F two octves and a fifth above. The most comfortable range for playing is somewhere in the middle. A competent player however can play with ease throughout the range, and even above, into the altissimo range.
The first step is to breathe from the diaphragm. 
The are a few ways to learn diaphragm breathing. Breathe as if filling up a bucket, ie. from the bottom of your lungs. To do this keep your shoulders level, and as your diaphragm lowers you should feel your stomach sink and your ribcage expand. Another way to learn is to visualise sleeping. You breathe from your diaphragm when sleeping, so try practising saxophone while asleep to achieve positive breathing technique.
Another step to achieving ease throughout the saxophone's range, is a solid embouchure. Many beginner saxophone players, automatically tense their lips when playing up high, and drop their jaw and loosen their lips when playing low. However this creates intonation problems. To overcome this use the same embouchure and lip strength from low Bb up to high F. This may make the lowest notes harder to play, and the higher notes sound weak. So when playing very low or high (especially below C or above Eb) use a strong stream of air to sound the notes. Using a stable embouchure will fix most intonation problems, and keep your saxophone in tune throughout your range.

To increase proficiency in playing below low C try these exercises.

1. hold low C
2. play C#, B and Bb in turn, playing low C in between each (play each note as a quaver or eigth note, creating an eighth note pattern within bar of 3/4)
3. check intonation with a tuner
4. start by playing slow and gradually increase the speed by playing with a metronome

To increase proficiency in playing above high D.

1. hold high D
2. play Eb, E, F and F# in turn, playing high D in between each (play each note as a quaver or eighth note, creating and eighth note pattern within a bar of 4/4)
3. check intonation with a tuner
4. start by playing slow and gradually increasing the speed by playing with a metronome

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Neutral Point of View ==
You have to wonder how hard it is going to be to achieve a neutral point of view in this book, when the topic is so hotly contested. (See link [[WB:NPOV]] for Wikibooks policy.) Is Animal Rights a field of knowledge that can be taught in a text book anyway, or is is more of a political movement like the Right to Life movement? I don't think there are Wikibooks on Abortion or Gay Marriage for example, and this book seems to present similar difficulties.

== Vivisection or Animal Testing? ==
Vivisection in most dictionaries is defined as surgical operations on living animals, and in common usage is associated with pain or cruelty towards the animal. Animal Testing is a broader term which includes vivisection and other uses of animals in research and testing which do not involve surgery. As this book is supposed to be unbiased, it is preferable to use the more neutral terminology. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 14:10, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

== Separate from Animal Welfare ==
Thank you for keeping this page separate from animal welfare.[[User:Ajkochanowicz|ajkochanowicz]] ([[User talk:Ajkochanowicz|talk]]) 21:30, 14 January 2010 (UTC)

== Different members handling different tasks ==

If different members handle different tasks, then the whole book will become a piece of collage, with different people writing in different tones and styles. Is it not possible to let all members collaborate on areas that interest them?

== Memory-Level Parallelism ==

{{Wikipedia|Memory level parallelism}}

'''Memory-Level Parallelism''' (MLP) is the ability to perform multiple memory transactions at once. In many architectures, this manifests itself as the ability to perform both a read and write operation at once, although it also commonly exists as being able to perform multiple reads at once. It is rare to perform multiple write operations at once, because of the risk of potential conflicts (trying to write two different values to the same location).

Notice that this is not the same as vectorized memory operations, such as reading 4 separate but contiguous 8-bit values in a single 32-bit read.</text>

Concerning categories, I don't see why difference should have a pole, as if every category has a corresponding opposite category.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Greg, thanks for your work here at Wikibooks! It's always good to see new members here. We've been working on an introduction page, [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] to help smooth over some of the differences between our project and WP. That document is always out of date and incomplete, so any feedback you may have about it would be a good help.

Please let me know if you need anything or if you have any questions about how things work around here. In some ways we're very similar to WP, but we also tend to be much nicer and more laid back. Good luck with your work, and good luck with your candidacy! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:25, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

:Many thanks, Whiteknight.  Out of respect to my platform, I'm not likely to contribute much here until I see authentic changes at the Foundation level that show a commitment to ethics, accuracy, and excellence in online media.  It would be like knowingly working in a managerial role for Enron because the folks in the mail room are really nice people.

::That's fine, and I appreciate your politics. I don't want to badmouth, but I'm aware that Wikipedia has some severe problems, and those are things that we need to seriously consider as a complete community. Luckily, Wikibooks has developed a far-different culture and community, and many other sister projects have done so as well. We have been fortunate to learn many lessons the easy way: by seeing Wikipedia's mistakes and choosing not to follow them. The battle at Wikipedia might be an uphill one, but as I hope we've proven here, there is plenty of hope. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:57, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

It is disappointing but hardly surprising. We don't have a huge volume of editors here, and most of the people we do have are already spoken for. Everybody here already has their own pet projects that keep them occupied. Writing a new book or even fixing an old one is far too big a task for most people to tackle casually. It is nice that we've identified the problem, that's the first step in making sure it gets resolved eventually. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:30, 25 January 2009 (UTC)

It's too bad that Thekohser didn't offer to improve anything here if unblocked like was done at Wikiversity; say, [[Wikipedia]], which is linked from [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] and would offer an opportunity to be constructive instead of destructive/obstructive within Wikimedia (if it were even possible for him to maintain a neutral point of view).

It may be that local administrators do not wish to wheel war over someone who hasn't contributed meaningfully here in a year after leaving in a huff because we just weren't active enough.

Perhaps it is time to reconsider the unblock request for Thekohser, being that he is actively contributing now to Commons and to Wikisource, and (through IP self-reversion) to Wikiversity.  Why is Wikibooks particularly afraid of him?  He's even looking out for Wikibooks' financial grant-writers.

I know that my input is not necessary here and now, but in reviewing some of the discussion about me in the Reading Room, I notice that there seems to be some question as to what prompted a call by Jimmy Wales for my global banning, anyway.  The evidence shows that my [http://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity%3ACommunity_Review%2FWikimedia_Ethics%3AEthical_Breaching_Experiments&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=545159&amp;oldid=545155 comment here] on Wikiversity is the straw that broke the camel's back.  Granted, Jimmy and I have had words with one another since about August 2006.  Multiple times over the years I've brought to public attention some sensitive items that he would rather have remained quiet or unnoticed.  Neutral observers can easily figure out what is really going on here, I trust. -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] ([[User talk:Thekohser|talk]]) 13:57, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

::I have been carefully trying to negotiate unblock on Wikiversity under conditions that would respect whatever legitimate needs of the WMF exist, and I expect that unblock to happen soon, the only reason he does not have an unblocked account there already is an unfortunate incident of wheel-warring, which is currently under review by the community. If Thekohser attempts to use Wikiversity or Wikibooks as a platform for ''illegitimate criticism'' of the WMF or WMF users, and this is not locally addressed and interdicted, this will prompt steward intervention. Hence, on Wikiversity, I've assured the community (and those involved with the WMF, if they watch or review) that the contributions of Thekohser will be watched for problems. It is ironic that it appears that it was early on suggested that Wikiversity would be an appropriate place to review WMF &quot;Ethics,&quot; because of the policy there allowing original research. However, what was missing were the combination of established ethical standards for such research, itself, and effective monitoring of the situation for possible abuse. This led to intervention by Jimbo, twice, in 2008 and in March, 2010. Thekohser's analysis of the immediate occasion for Jimbo's action is cogent, and possibly correct, but I recommend he drop it here. It is not relevant. Thekohser was blocked here as part of an action at meta to ''lift'' the global lock and allow local communities to decide. I.e., stewards went around and implemented local blocks that could then be reversed locally. It is unknown why, later, May 30, Mike.lifeguard reinstated the global lock, making all that steward work earlier moot, but I can guess, and it's not a bad reason. But it's really moot for this wiki, which is capable of monitoring and addressing problematic contributions by Thekohser. I do not suggest allowing any of the wikis to be used for &quot;cross-wiki&quot; criticism or disruption, absent standards and monitoring for abuse. There should be no harm at all in allowing Thekohser to make ordinary and useful contributions. If anyone thinks he is straying from that, I recommend they warn him, and if he ignores the warning, take action. Any problematic contributions can be reverted by any ordinary editor, and this can be discussed as needed, without repeating the problems. Good luck, Wikibooks. This is your decision, that's quite clear. The stewards are not telling you what to do. (If they need to, they will!). --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 17:15, 11 August 2010 (UTC)

:::I appreciate the need to have other related subjects addressed but it is somehow obvious that the issues shouldn't be mixed and no chance should be given to mix them. Extending the discussion beyond the issue at hand (the block/unblock) is not productive and risks derailing the process into something that it seems you are indicating has occurred at Wikiversity.
:::I ask you not to cover for now other subjects until the user has been returned to a state of equality.
:::I don't agree with the phrase &quot;If Thekohser attempts to use Wikiversity or Wikibooks as a platform for ''illegitimate criticism'' of the WMF or WMF users, and this is not locally addressed and interdicted, this will prompt steward intervention.&quot; (at many levels), but I think the community, as per the suggestion given on the discussion, should take steps not to allow a repetition of this external intervention. As for the criticism I don't think Wikibooks is the forum for WMF discussion (that would be meta) but I would welcome any intervention if in context to our project. WMF and WMF collaborators aren't perfect and  they should be able address any issue that concerns them.

I'm agreeing with you, the phrase &quot;illegitimate criticism&quot; covers all kinds of criticism that would not be allowed here. My comments gave some history, and that is not criticism, in itself. Sometimes, to understand the arguments that some will raise, it's necessary to have some history. It's a grey area. What's happening on Wikiversity is almost the same as what is happening here. Almost everyone wants the account unblocked or doesn't know about the issue or doesn't care. The involved sysops and 'crats want to be careful, to protect all interests, so the process is taking time. What I wrote about the &quot;if Thekohser uses....&quot; was not a criticism of Thekohser, nor a claim that his criticism has been or would be illegitimate, it was a prediction, the kind of thing that the Foundation, from Jimbo on out, will want local wikis to consider. If the needs of the Foundation are neglected, Foundation functionaries are likely to intervene. We don't want that and they don't want that, they are only likely to do it if they see some kind of emergency.
::::Bottom line: if the Wikibooks community is satisfied that it has the resources to monitor the situation and discover and handle problems locally, responding to concern from the WMF if that's expressed, then unblocking Thekohser is safe. If not, it could be risking future disruption. It might still be harmless, that would be up to Thekohser, really. The global lock, whether legitimate or not, was intended, clearly, to set a default condition; local wikis can then decide whether to move around that or not. I advise caution, but, you should realize, I've been supporting the unblock of Thekohser, and, as a probationary custodian on Wikiversity, did unblock his acknowledged alternate account. There was no damage from that unblock; the disruption on Wikiversity came from wheel-warring on the unblock, and subsequent block enforcement measures, and that is currently being resolved. I have no crystal ball, but right now it looks like 95% that Thekohser will be unblocked within a matter of days, using the same approach as you are using here. My post here was merely to inform this community of what was happening on Wikiversity, as well as a bit of the history, and I've also reported your process on Wikiversity as well. The principles are quite the same, and I agree with the apparent consensus at this point at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Reading_room/General&amp;oldid=1909254#On_the_subject_of_the_block_of_Thekohser_and_the_implications_to_our_local_community.2Fproject]. Thanks. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 18:27, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

:::::As I said this considerations should be discussed at a later time as they aren't related to the current action (they aren't because events didn't happen on this project, haven't been established as a valid reason for the block or having a bearing on the unblock and we already seen that we need to make changes in our local rules to prevent a repetition. It shouldn't also be assumed that the user will engage in any sort of abuse here since he hasn't done it before).
:::::You also need to realize that the user at this time is limited on the way he may participate on any discussion or even considering the situation he is in, it can easily serve to provoke him into making statements that can unnecessarily aggravate the problem. Being blocked is an extremely frustrating situation. We should wait and not give a chance to permit any aggravation by prematurely digging deep on the subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:25, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

== Status report after two weeks ==

It has been approximately two weeks since my request for unblock.  Could someone summarize for me about where we stand on this process, and what is the pathway ahead for us?  It seems to me that the globally-acting agent is the only one acting out of process, without support.  But correct me if I'm wrong. -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] (editing from [[Special:Contributions/68.87.42.110|68.87.42.110]] ([[User talk:68.87.42.110|talk]]) 19:10, 26 August 2010 (UTC))

:We have discussed your situation and it was found that we don't have any motive to block you locally, in fact it has been determined by the normal decision process that the block should not stand as there is no consensus to support it. The only voice objecting to restore you to the normal was by Mike but based in unsubstantiated allegations that you are globally banned. Mike has unilaterally and without backing from the community reblocked you (in violation of the local policy) in a reversal of the action by Adrignola in behalf of the community. At present you are in fact in limbo, you shouldn't consider yourself blocked or banned by the Wikibooks community but without an admin willing to act there is nothing more we can do. This situation you find yourself is not new and is based on the fact that no one is obliged to act, it is comprehensible that Adrignola has excused himself to continue to act further on the subject.
:The only avenues open for you is (non-destructive) civil disobedience as to call and force an action from the community (depending on how you go about it, in special the level of disruption, you will incur the risk that it can backfire on you), to go outside of Wikibooks for instance to an appeal to a steward that is willing to act in behalf of our community and fix your situation or wait that an admin changes his mind or a new one is elected that has the will to enforce our policies and complies with our decision process.
:Keep in mind that part of the community does recognize the injustice of your situation, not based in any support for alleged actions your made outside of Wikibooks, that most of us see as outside of our capacity to act, verify or control (that is the domain of the projects were the alleged actions took place or meta) but recognizes this local situation as an aberration brought to our community from outside that has resulted in unparalleled disregard for our local rules and normal practices.
:Good luck, I (and probably other Wikibookias) will be available and willing to go outside of Wikibooks to make this situation clear or support a proper decision process that will analise and reach a clear decision about the accusations made against you.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:54, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

:::I'm attempting to see in what grounds Pi zero disagrees with the facts as I presented them. It would be interesting and useful if Thekohser himself made an analysis of the situation and establish a log. Since Thekohser is unblocked at Wikiversity keeping it there on his userspace would also create visibility to what is happening on Wikibooks (even making a comparison regarding the process of regularization across projects), this will also prevent confusion regarding signing the edits.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:30, 27 August 2010 (UTC)

::::I don't know for sure, of course, but Pi zero may have been influenced by representations made to him off-wiki by Mike.lifeguard, there have been other signs that this is happening. Pi zero, I'd encourage you to watch for and participate in any process that carefully considers the issues. Lots of stuff gets said that simply is not true, and toss enough mud, some of it sticks. There are very important metacommunity issues involved here, they are larger than Thekohser, or, frankly, I wouldn't be bothering with this. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:04, 27 August 2010 (UTC)

:::Civil disobedience in this case will only be considered so by anyone clinging to the fact that the block was not yet lifted, as meaning that the user is banned from the community.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:05, 27 August 2010 (UTC)

:::: I know that at least two admins where not able to take part in the unblock discussion.  It has a very short life in the reading room.  In short I don't believe it lives up to our usual definition of consensus.  At least three admins (and some editors) currently support the block judging from the recent discussion in the reading room.  I trust Pi Zero to make up his own mind despite who he may have spoken with off wiki.

::::: There is no requirement that all admins participate or that they are always present, but there is at least a presumable expectation that they will extend the administrative task to inspect what other admins are doing. In this case you should have noticed that several blocks were performed and the situation the user was in, long before I felt the need to make the situation more publicly known. I again call your attention to the error you make on the analysis of the issue, there was no need for a consensus, the user was improperly interfered with in the first place, as the original action has no sanction its undoing does not require one.
::::: In fact I hope this is the last time that &quot;time&quot; is called as a validation for the inability of people to properly justify unwillingness to take a position and apply our rules. To this fact and to close this issue about the time available, I call you to examine the date I brought the issue to a more public review and the first time anyone protested about the time frame granted to the discussions, all my posts initiating discussions clearly indicated the time attributed to running them. I dismiss any argument about &quot;no time to participate&quot; if no objection was present about that fact in the 7 days after my initial posts establishing 3 days for the first discussion and 7 days for the second.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:35, 28 August 2010 (UTC)

I understand your position, and why you think I made an error, but I simply disagree with it.  Also, I am not using time as a way of justifying an &quot;unwillingness to take a position&quot;.  I made my position clear in the reading room.  I appreciate that we disagree about the situation, and I hope you recognize there is not as much of a consensus on this issue.

:::::::The points I read you raising are that you don't recognize the  subject because you didn't participate in the discussion, that the situation of Thekohser requires specific consensus to unblock and that you still defend that we are the right forum to discuss the alleged actions of Thekohser outside of Wikibooks.
:::::::I have now demonstrated why I disagree with those views. I've pointed out their problems, that they go against our normal practices and outside of our project's scope. You have yet to demonstrate the opposite, why should we create an exception here? Why should we come to agree with you ?
:::::::I have from the beginning stated that there is no consensus on the subject, that was why I proposed to restore the user situation to the original state of freedom.

Meanwhile, I note that not a bit of work has been completed on [[World War II/Strategic Bombing in Europe]].  Had I been unblocked two weeks ago, I could have completed that section for Wikibooks by now.  This is appearing very clearly now to be far more about political fealty to Mike.lifeguard and Jimmy Wales than about care and concern for the Wikibooks project itself.  I have been unblocked on English Wikisource, Wikimedia Commons, and English Wikiversity, and I have been contributing recently to all three.  I have not noticed one whit of disruption that I've spurred at any of those three projects, and it's been months now on a couple of them.  Could the Wikibooks community please describe for me what ''exactly'' it is that you fear will result from an unblock here that will be damaging to either the project or to the project community?  Perhaps I can offer assurances that those fears will not be realized, if only I knew what they were. -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] (using [[Special:Contributions/68.87.42.110|68.87.42.110]] ([[User talk:68.87.42.110|talk]]) 13:12, 30 August 2010 (UTC))

:I am unfamiliar with the term fealty, you mean a sense of obligation or loyalty?  My objections are based on your actions elsewhere, such as using Cool3's account. I have no real reason to believe you have seen any error in your ways. Moreover, you have a handful of edits over a period of years here, which to me makes claims that you now really want to write a page on strategic bombing seem less than sincere.  In the mean time, if I am wrong, I have recently found out developing textbooks also falls under the scope of WV.

You did not understand the issues when you filed it, and you still do not understand the result. That was about a class project, an integral part of an educational resource for a real university class using Wikiversity for much of its process.

::: I did check a dictionary, I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing some connotation. I will attempt to answer your questions in roughly the order they were asked.  My &quot;evidence&quot; was a statement by you during your steward election, I think you said it was &quot;abundently clear&quot;.  The evidence is strong enough to satisfy me.  No I have not seen the primary evidence myself, but I will take your word. I have no idea if it violated a terms of service.  But I am not filtering through each edit looking for edits I consider disruptive or edits that violate terms of service.  Editing from an account with administrator tools after you had already been blocked is disruptive enough in my book. If you would care to tell me about exactly how you came by this account I would be curious to know.  Was the accout of Cool3 yours from the very beginning, and if so are you also Cool three?

::::Please tell me I didn't type &quot;abundently&quot; (sic).  So, you feel that the evidence shows that editing as an administrator when blocked on another account, doing no visible harm at all to Wikipedia (in fact, helping out quite ably), and admittedly no violation of any terms of service transpiring for activity on the site, is -- in a word -- &quot;disruptive&quot;.  You have a very special perspective, my friend.  I wonder if I were to wipe my mouth with a napkin in a restaurant, would that be disruptive to the other diners?  Anyway, if you are convinced that the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee knows beyond a reasonable doubt that Cool3 was being used by me while Thekohser was blocked, then shouldn't the Arbitration Committee also be able to deduce whether or not the Cool3 account was mine from the beginning, and whether or not I was Cool three?  I would tell you the entire story myself, but I am advised not to issue my own public testimony about this, because I was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=337910971 threatened on Wikipedia] with federal electronic terrorism charges (18 U.S.C. § 1030) if my story happened to incriminate myself.

There are many Wikipedians and other WMF users who are completely clueless on the original meaning of [[w:WP:IAR]]. Many users use and have used alternative accounts, with and without disclosure, and to my knowledge there are no TOS restrictions against this. Community norms might be violated, sometimes, but community norms do not establish a legal requirement, nor do they ''necessarily'' establish a moral one that supersedes IAR or the norms of ordinary human society, which include expectations of fair treatment; whatever moral obligation exists to cooperate within community norms, when a user is openly allowed editing privileges, disappears when the user is blocked or banned, which is one reason why it can be a very bad idea to address disputes by blocking disputants, more than &quot;please step outside the room while this cools off!.&quot; Moral covenants are void when without consideration, for those inclined to legal explanations. Nothing offered, nothing required in return. What, exactly, is the community offering a blocked editor, that the editor has some obligation in return, assuming that he or she accepts the offer?

If I persist in disrespectful treatment, shame on me.
:::::Among other things, activity that improves the project can only be called disruptive in a narrow sense. If we look at the contributions of Cool3, we see evidence of many hours of contributions.

(Thenub has declined (on Wikiversity) to communicate with me by email on this, citing concerns about his identity. Personally, I don't have a great deal of trust in administrators who are not willing to be open about identity, it can cover up much that a community should actually know. But under current policy, that's his privilege. Ordinarily, though, even hostile administrators, on Wikipedia, have often responded to email from me.)

:::::::As to getting banned first, obviously not. However, I do not equate and protect the dignity of administrators, with free rein to libel and defame blocked editors, in the same way as the dignity of those blocked. When I see an administrator standing up for the rights of those who have been abused, arguing for fair treatment consistent with the welfare of the project, and acting for that when possible (it is not always possible!), then I am more likely to assign to myself a responsibility to treat them equally. When one takes on privileged executive power, and exercises it, there arises a responsibility to behave under higher standards. Basically, I expect more of administrators than of ordinary editors, and more of ordinary editors than of blocked editors. Doesn't that seem natural? And, remember, I'm just an ordinary editor here and elsewhere. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 21:11, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

==Suggestions==
First of all, do not take the advice to use Wikiversity to address problems here, unless it is done with extreme caution. That is, you could, at Wikiversity, acknowledge that certain IP edits here are yours. That should not be controversial, but it's also probably not necessary now.

The situation at Wikibooks is difficult, probably because of a shortage of admins to address issues. Adrignola's response is not surprising. He's not willing to wheel-war, unless there is a clear consensus behind him. He's a 'crat. That's his obligation. The problem is that another 'crat is not respecting process, and has misrepresented the truth of the situation, and has clearly been canvassing, presenting arguments elsewhere for his views here, which is also generally contrary to policy. It is known that there is no steward consensus on the meaning of the &quot;ban.&quot; It is clear that there is, in fact, no &quot;ban.&quot; A real ban would mean that a user would be blocked on all WMF wikis, and that's obviously not true, and it is not just Wikiversity.

Normally, it can be called a &quot;ban&quot; when no admin is willing to unblock, or, alternatively, there is a clear community decision to ban -- i.e., an admin unblocking would be violating consensus. However, an admin did unblock here, having reviewed the arguments and consensus, and another admin reversed that without any disruptive behavior or additional evidence. The only evidence was &quot;He's banned and that's that.&quot; Well, obviously Thekohser isn't banned, because an admin was willing to unblock, and there is no community consensus prohibiting that, neither here nor at meta.

Rather, the situation at Wikibooks is that there is an admin and 'crat who believes he owns the place, and if the community isn't willing to address that, ''he owns the place.'' In fact, the whole issue is in limbo. it will take time.

It is possible to address this at meta, but I'd consider it premature. I would not try without identified steward support. Not yet.

So, my suggestion for the near future, Thekohser, is that you follow what was done at Wikiversity. Self-reverted edits, good content, not controversial. Theoretically, the goal of blocks is to prevent disruptive content. Therefore if you do this, you can &quot;suggest&quot; content, and you can list those edits on this page. This isn't &quot;evasive,&quot; if you identify the edits. If the IP is blocked, it will be demonstrating that something is going on besides fulfilling the ''purpose'' of bans. And the community, as it becomes aware, will not support this.

(And if it does, the wiki will likely fail, and you are better off not investing in a sinking ship. But it won't, that's my strong sense.)

Others watching, notice if Thekohser makes self-reverted edits. They should stand out fairly easily, they will be IP edits with a summary that includes &quot;will self-revert per block of Thekohser,&quot; and they will then be self-reverted. If you care to help, review these edits, and restore them if they appear to be good content. Thekohser is not likely to push the edge.

I did most of this work on Wikiversity, with some help. I will not do the work here, because I'm trying to respect that, in some sense, I'm an &quot;outsider&quot; and I might not understand local traditions.

There should be no reason to block the IP, if it is only used for good edits, even more if only for self-reverted edits (because there is no need for anyone who doesn't want to do it to examine the content for suitability), but, hey, there was no reason to block Thekohser here either. So it may happen. Thekohser, please be patient.

And those who think of what I'm suggesting as &quot;encouraging block evasion,&quot; please understand that the ultimate goal of policies and guidelines and procedures is good content, obtained with reasonable efficiency. The &quot;self-reversion&quot; plan produces only good content, as defined by ''unblocked editors,'' taking responsibility for it. I'm encouraging the contribution of good content. Period.

Meanwhile, '''I will ask for this user page to be unblocked, and/or for email to be allowed.''' Thekohser is allowed to send email at meta, I see no reason why not here. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 15:00, 27 August 2010 (UTC)

::Those who care more about enforcing arbitrary rules, and confirming their own prior expressed opinions, than they do about the welfare of the project, can be expected to oppose what I suggested; in any case, if Thekohser elects to proceed in this way, it cannot be stopped. Nor, in fact, should it be.

::'''Thenub, please give me one reason why Thekohser should respect your request.''' Not from your point of view, but from his. You want him to continue to be banned, but for no clear reason, only citations of behavior, without evidence, based on rumors from elsewhere. This is not exactly the way to elicit his voluntary cooperation, and, since your position now makes no sense to him, why should he expect your support in the future, should he cooperate with your request?

::'''The general consensus, confirmed in multiple places, is that wiki users are only to be blocked for misbehavior on the wiki itself,''' and blocking them for behavior elsewhere is a slippery slope, involving hearsay, rumors, political intrugue, personal agendas, none of it verifiable from the clear record of the wiki itself, and thus readily susceptible to disruptive disagreement. On almost every wiki that has considered the issue, recently, a 'crat has unlocked the account so it could be locally unblocked, and it has been unblocked. Except here. Why here? Well, you know why. One administrator and 'crat here, the same person as the steward who implemented the global lock, alone, with no cited support, on May 30, quite apparently without consensus at meta, personally blocked again after Adrignola unblocked based on discussion. He did not base the block on local misbehavior, only on an alleged &quot;global ban&quot; that obviously does not now exist, since Thekohser is now editing freely on a number of significant projects, being Wikisource, Wikinews, Wikiversity, and Commons.

::You can see the global account status at [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ACentralAuth&amp;target=Thekohser]. You can see that Pathoschild, who made most of the standing blocks, see, say, [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Thekohser wiktionary], wrote ''Blocked indefinitely. Reason: requested by Jimbo for disruption/trolling at http://en.wikiversity.org/?diff=548143 (global lock changed to local block to let local community change it)'' '''The purpose of this action was to let local wikis make the decision, and, my guess, to still protect small wikis without the local resources to detect and address feared disruption.''' (That would be the reason for the global lock, which is more normally reserved for cross-wiki vandalism.) On de.wikipedia, you will notice that Thekohser is not blocked. That's because local administration undid the block. But that account is still attached, which simply means that the situation has not yet been addressed there. All the accounts which show today as being detached are also unblocked, except for Wikibooks.

::The discussion on Wikiversity cited as the &quot;request&quot; for this block wasn't a request, it was simply Jimbo's comment, based, apparently, on his intention at the time. Later, '''Jimbo explicitly abandoned such interference in local wiki business.''' Rightly, I and others would deeply respect and consider his requests, but ... he is a human being and sometimes makes mistakes. In the end, WMF wikis depend on the ''community,'' not on any individual, not even one of the Founders.

::If you look at the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=User%3AThekohser&amp;type=block local block log for Thekohser], you will see that Pathoschild blocked, but that a few days later, May 12, Mike.lifeguard reblocked to disallow Talk page access (Thus defeating part of the purpose of Pathoschild's action, by disallowing a normal block request). '''Mike's later reblock, August 13, was clearly wheel-warring, an offense that Jimbo has often decried, because it is highly disruptive and damaging.''' He was asked if he was acting locally or as a steward, and he confirmed that the action was based on his local concerns. If he had claimed to be acting as a steward, it would have been obligatory to address this matter at meta, not here. And, my guess, his steward bit would have been toast. '''The WMF and the steward community consensus does not want to be lording it over local wikis, but rather exists to serve them,''' and they would definitely not want Mike to be violating this, as well as [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Stewards_policy#Transparency violating basic steward policy], which requires that steward decisions be based on open discussion on meta.

::Pathoschild wrote: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Pathoschild&amp;oldid=2101118#Unblock_proceedings_at_Wikibooks], Mike's statements reflect his personal opinion;] '''there is no steward consensus in favour of enforcing the ban in this way.''' My conversion of the global lock into local blocks was supported by steward discussion, although Mike is free to see it as a mistake.''

::Mike, note, in his [http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=globalauth&amp;user=&amp;page=User%3AThekohser%40global&amp;year=2010&amp;month=5&amp;tagfilter= May 30 global lock], gave this summary: ''‎(per discussion)'', implying consensus. However, he [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mike.lifeguard#Global_locks_of_Thekohser_and_Thekohser-2 was asked] about what this meant. His first response was, ''The reality is he's banned, and the ban is being enforced.''

::So I asked again, more specifically, about the &quot;discussion.&quot; His response: ''&quot;Being enforced&quot; is passive voice because I'm not the only person enforcing this, but I couldn't be bothered to figure out who else had locked accounts etc. Jimbo banned him from all WMF projects.  – mike@meta:~$  15:23, 5 July 2010 (UTC)''

::Again, I'd mentioned his use of the &quot;passive voice,&quot; and he chose to respond to that instead of the question about the discussion. I was trying to find where it was decided that Thekohser was globally banned and that it was to be enforced through a global lock. (At that point I did not know about the 'crat workaround.)

::So I asked again, and he finally replied. ''There was both general and specific discussion. Much of the general discussion was in IRC (over a span of weeks); the specific discussion spread between stewards-l, checkuser-l, and some by private email. There's not one place I could point to for &quot;The Discussion&quot; which is why I didn't''

::'''Mike is writing in a way that later creates deniability.''' &quot;I didn't claim that there was a consensus for global locking.&quot; But he has just acknowledged taking steward action without the open discussion required by Steward policy: '''''Discussion of steward actions should occur on Meta, rather than privately, so editors can understand the stewards' decisions.'''''

::Mike went on to say, ''I don't think you noticed that there are other stewards locking his accounts as well.'' Again, he is making an implication without actually lying. I have seen two stewards who locked Thekohser. Turns out -- I hadn't see this before, that Jimbo agreed to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_58#Thekohser global lock on his Talk page on Wikipedia]. That was May 3. Now, Magister Mathematicae had been the first to set a global lock that day. He then unset it, saying ''‎(ok, jimbo cna [sic] do it if it's true)'' So he asked Jimbo, and Jimbo clearly didn't want a &quot;big campaign,&quot; but accepted the idea of using the global lock. But he didn't do what had been suggested. He didn't do it himself. Instead, Magister did it, citing Jimbo's comment. Basing a steward action on discussion off of meta, violating policy. (I'd recommend reading the last comment in that Jimbo Talk page sequence.)

::Pathoschild undid this May 5, and did the local blocks, not citing the Jimbo &quot;permission,&quot; which would clearly be politically problematic, but citing the earlier comment of Jimbo on Wikiversity. Pathoschild has confirmed that his action was based on discussions. But where? I found no trace of this discussion on-wiki. My conclusion? '''It's a political hot potato. At this time, Jimbo was facing an RfC at meta over the very actions he had taken at Wikiversity.''' [[m:Requests_for_comment/Remove_Founder_flag]]. May 5, the RfC wasn't passing, it was at 23:32. But it was about to explode. Comments based on Jimbo's intervention at Commons started pouring in, beginning the 7th. At present, that RfC reached 405:125, and, on May 11, '''Jimbo requested that his intrusive Founder flag permissions be withdrawn.''' He's still got special privileges, but clearly only to allow him to ''see'' what is happening, not to control it.

::There is no way that Jimbo is going to openly support the ban of Thekohser. So is Mike.lifeguard carrying his water? I certainly hope not, and I'm going to assume that (1) Jimbo had a good reason for considering Thekohser banned and for wanting this enforced, but also (2) That reason does not exist any more.

::Why does the reason not exist any more? Well, '''under present conditions, it takes 'crat action to delink the account. No 'crat is likely to do this and then allow Thekohser to run wild.''' The problem of Wikiversity was a local community that was unable to resolve disputes, when there were, in fact, &quot;cross-wiki issues&quot; involved, i.e., the use of Wikiversity as a platform for criticism of &quot;WikiMedia ethics.&quot; I happen to think that such criticism, properly done, is crucial. But it must be done according to carefully crafted guidelines, or it will be extraordinarily disruptive. I want Thekohser's participation in this, it is within his expertise, which is why I assisted his return to Wikiversity. But I very much don't want him to abuse that access, in order to pursue personal &quot;vendettas,&quot; and I trust that he will respect this, because I also trust that he understands my long-term goals, which probably dovetail with at least some of his. He will make positive contributions at Wikibooks, or at least harmless ones, and if he runs outside that and ordinary warnings don't work, he will be blocked again. There is no danger, after all that happened, of a repeat. And, meanwhile, he will make positive contributions here, it is consistent with what he wants to accomplish.

::You may support the ''result,'' of Mike's action, for your own reasons (Cool3? An admin account on Wikipedia that did a great deal of good work, with no allegations of ''actual disruption,'' other than possible identity of the user. Given the value of the work done by Cool3, seems that Wikipedia got the better part of that deal.) But if you cannot recognize the abuse of process involved, I'd seriously worry about your own capacities as a sysop. Would you do the same?

::Stewards most certainly could create and enforce a global ban if they have consensus to do so, or direction from the WMF Board. They have not done so, and the strongest indication we have of apparent consensus appears in the local block log for Thekohser. A default &quot;global block&quot; was established, with local wikis having the right and the ability to reverse it. That was frustrated but not defeated by the global lock. The local account is now detached and an unblock here would be effective.

::'''The most effective argument for unblock for a user like this, I have found, is not prior process failure, but a record of positive contributions.''' That is why the self-reversion approach is suggested to him. Through it, he may establish a record of positive contributions without complicating block enforcement. Because the edits are self-reverted, they do not require immediate attention, it is safe to rely upon complaint of actual and seriously disruptive content (and even such is usually harmless if it has been reverted). Self-reversion with identification of the user in the edit summary is, in fact, proof of cooperation with the community under difficult conditions. Truly disruptive users, I've found, will not agree to do this. They would rather disrupt, they would rather create enforcement difficulties.

::'''Self reversion requires cooperation to be established between a blocked user and unblocked users.''' I have seen this cooperation arise where the cooperating unbanned editor was the very one who had requested the ban in the first place. If you know of any other way to establish cooperation like this (which is based on a mutual desire for actual project improvement that transcends prior disputes), please let me know.

::Thekohser has strong intrinsic motivation to remain within acceptable behavior. I do not believe that a record of self-reverted contributions will count against him when unblock is being considered. They are intrinsically non-disruptive (if they are positive contributions and do not contain ''seriously objectionable'' content, such as gross incivility or outing.)

::That you oppose this, Thenub, exposes the foundations of how you view wiki process. I'm not going to say more of what that means, but this community may ultimately draw its own conclusions from obvious evidence. I urge you to reconsider. Thanks. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 23:06, 30 August 2010 (UTC)

::: That is quite a lot to read.  I understand you have quite a lot of doubt about my abilities as an administrator, and it may be that my opinions differ significantly from the opinions of others.  I find myself in this position often.  If the community ultimately disagrees with me, I can accept that.  I am just pointing out that some users (such as myself) would find this type of action disruptive, particularly if it were carried out on a large scale.  Regardless of the nature of the content added.  Thekohser's only motivation for avoiding this would be he wished to avoid more conflict about the situation. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 02:22, 31 August 2010 (UTC)
::::This is the classic response of someone who has not thought an unfamiliar idea all the way through.
::::*This is not likely to be carried out on a truly large scale, not for long, anyway. But suppose it was. Compare this with ordinary IP socking, say. Which would you prefer, to see block-evading IP edits, not self-identified, requiring review of each one, until the identity is verified and the IP is blocked, and with the edits requiring reversion, or that the blocked editor self-identity, and self-revert? Which one requires more work from the community?
::::*Suppose you believe that the contributions of an editor are worthless disruption. So you see some self-reverted edits. What do you do? Do you review them, wasting your time, so that you can determine that they are truly worthless? Why? Why not simply allow the editor, himself or herself, to ''enforce the block'' by self-reverting? Should you still block the IP? After all, the editor has made it easy to identify it! I'm claiming that, no, you should not, if it is only being used for self-reverted edits. It is *easy* to deal with self-reverted edits, and the work that proceeds after this (to consider the edits for possible restoration) is only done by those who think it might be worthwhile. What, exactly, is the problem with this? Only good content comes out of such a process! In actual practice, this builds cooperation between blocked editors and the rest of the community. Do you want to resolve conflicts or to perpetuate them?
::::*Suppose some unblocked editor is in cahoots with a blocked editor, and simply reverts those edits back in, even if they are in themselves disruptive. Well, that is an identifiable problem behavior of an unblocked account, and that account should be warned, and blocked if needed. I would not advise a sock of a blocked editor to take on restoring the self-reverted edits of a blocked editor, it would attract attention! (And for the same reason, I would not allow IP reversion back in of self-reverted &quot;under ban&quot; edits, creating possible sock suspicions.)
::::*As to some sort of idea that Thekohser gains by &quot;avoiding this,&quot; I don't see anything that would be a gain for him. You would basically shut him out, without any possibility of contribution. Why? To &quot;avoid conflict&quot;? As far as I can see, someone who would raise a conflict over self-reverted edits has their own problems, has some agenda that is quite other than the welfare of the wiki. (I'm not talking about self-reverted edits that are attempting to game the system. As an example, self-reverting &quot;outing&quot; would be no protection, and would remain disruptive. Gross incivility might be the same, it's a judgment call.)
::::*And against your totally unsubstantiated and shallow opinion, I have actual experience with self-reverted edits to point to. When a community is reasonably functional, it works. It worked on Wikiversity. WV, with little cost, gained some good content. And, as I've described, I've seen it work on Wikipedia. So ... why would it not work on Wikibooks? It will work better if this account has Talk page access, so that Thekohser can log in and acknowledge that the IP is his. But that's not necessary, it just helps avoid complications like straw puppetry.
::::You may not realize what depth of experience is behind these suggestions. They are not casual whims.
::::&quot;Regardless of the nature of the content added&quot; betrays a lack of concern for content, in favor of strict adherence to formal rules, even when the ''substance'' of the rules is being respected. That's a decline in understanding, it represents wikiknowledge that has been &quot;stubbed.&quot; Now do you understand? --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:57, 31 August 2010 (UTC)

==Unblocked==

There's a clear community consensus to unblock your account, so I've unblocked it. As I said at the Reading Room, the community has not suggested placing any conditions on the unblock. Thank you for your patience while this process worked its way through. Wikibooks as you know is a small community and lacks a number of the forums (such as an arbcom) of the bigger projects that might have made this process easier. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:02, 9 September 2010 (UTC)

:::There was nothing to arbitrate over. The block proponents didn't have much of a case, and the unblock proponents didn't have much to defend from. This was not a difference between several users that could be resolved by a committee. This was a problem that had to be hashed out with the whole community. -[[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 19:21, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
::::That's probably incorrect. The issue that would have gone to local process would not have been the unblock of Thekohser, but, rather, defiance of expressed consensus and administrative action, through wheel-warring. On Wikipedia, a sysop can lose their bit from wheel-warring, and it may not matter that they were ''right,'' that's not the issue. The issue is process, a very important part of process, which is that ''admins don't wheel-war.'' Mike returned the block of Thekohser to the position that he himself had established (total block, no talk page access, no e-mail), after the block had been lifted by Adrignola. At that point, his obligation would have been to not return to his prior action, insisting on it. The general principle is that, before this is done, and absent a true emergency (what was the emergency?), he should have taken the matter to the community for discussion, if discussion with Adrignola didn't accomplish the matter, and then a decision would be made by ''another'' administrator. He didn't discuss with Adrignola, at least not on-wiki, and this kind of stuff, for transparency, should be on-wiki, at least the arguments should be presented on-wiki.
::::And if there was an emergency, he should have acted, declaring it so, and then consulted the community, not wait for someone else to start further discussion. That's the general obligation of administrators, it's explicit on Wikipedia, which has had to establish the clearest guidelines on this. The arguments against it generally depend on the admin being the &quot;last bulwark against the hordes of spammers, pov-pushers, and trolls&quot; which is how it starts to look to a burned-out administrator who has not realized how to turn most of the work over to the community, who has come to think that, for the welfare of the wiki, he or she must ''own'' it. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 19:56, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

== Mike's farewell ==

Your comment [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Farewell|here]] is somewhat of a nuisance. He is the brain of wikibooks, and that makes it seem like you're glad to see him go. Cheers, [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 19:32, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
:I have mixed feelings about this. He may have been important to WikiBooks at one time, but wikis that depend on one person are in deep trouble, almost certainly. I think that Thekohser's remark was unnecessarily strong, but, knowing Thekohser, it was at least expressing some positive wishes. I tried to make a more neutral comment that acknowledged conflict or opposition without insisting on my side of it. Arlen, I think you should realize that Thekohser was the target of quite a bit of serious assumptions of bad faith, that he did, in fact, put in a lot of work to improve the project, in different ways than Mike, so if he hasn't let go of all the resentments yet, it would not be surprising. That's somewhat of a consequence for the way that Mike went, particularly in the Latter Days. As a community, we need to develop ways to not allow situations to come to that point; we need to start restraining administrators who become too involved before they go off the deep end, and we need to find ways to support administrators before the stress gets to them. Those in the community who sit back, thankful that their Favorite Administrator is in charge, so they don't have to look at and think about problems that come up, some of which can take some Serious Thinking and even Investigation, are actually helping lead the guy down the rosy path. It inflates the guy's ego while, at the same time, not providing the actual support he needs to continue to do a good job. That necessary support includes friends who will criticize, as well as lend a hand. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 19:45, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

:You mean he &quot;was&quot; the brain of Wikibooks?  (Whatever that means, &quot;the brain&quot;.)  I hope that his brain serves him well outside of Wikimedia Foundation projects.  That's a positive, favorable, encouraging farewell! -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] ([[User talk:Thekohser|talk]]) 20:14, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

Regarding your [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;curid=69493&amp;diff=1932481&amp;oldid=1899932 recent edit].  I appreciate your intention was not to stir up trouble, but this edit comes across as purely attacking the integrity of one of our former users.  I would ask you to avoid such edits in the future, they are by their nature disruptive and are likely to result in a block, which is some place none of us wish to return to.  A good rule of thumb might be: if your tempted to start a post with &quot;I don't want to stir up trouble&quot;, then you should probably avoid that post.

:I'll agree, Greg. Making that comment shows that you were aware that your post would create the ''appearance'' of trying to stir up trouble. Otherwise, why would you deny it? If you actually want to avoid stirring up trouble, then pay attention to that as an alarm bell. That doesn't mean that you should not raise an important issue, but that, given all the history, perhaps you should consult with others first, before barging ahead, or be extraordinarily careful about asking yourself the question, &quot;Why am I doing this?&quot; Was the purpose to suggest that Wikibooks start hosting video game manuals? I think that if you were to get really honest with yourself about the purpose there, it really was to &quot;stir up trouble.&quot; You may have all the noble reasons in the world for doing this, you may believe that we would all want to know about actions taken with a conflict of interest, but, after all, this was three years ago and this isn't the place to do ''anything'' about those old actions, except for the question I mentioned, or about, as I shifted the issue there, how Wikibooks makes decisions, which should not be heavily influenced by a single person, no matter how respected. Thanks for your careful consideration of this. By the way, what do you think about the fact that Barack Obama wasn't actually born in the U.S.?
:Just kidding! But that is, in fact, almost as relevant to Wikibooks today as what you brought up.
:You have plenty of other places, much more visible than that Talk page, which hardly anyone watches, to bring up these old issues if you want. Please don't waste the opportunity you have here to continue to make positive contributions to this community. That will, in fact, help your overall cause of ethical reform. --[[User:Abd|Abd]] ([[User talk:Abd|talk]]) 20:32, 15 September 2010 (UTC)
::The only reason my statement of several facts in that post would &quot;stir up trouble&quot; would be that people are uncomfortable with disconcerting facts being presented.  If the Wikibooks architecture and community are so vulnerable to uncomfortable facts, then we might as well just get this over with, and someone hand out the block of my account immediately. Some people have engaged constructively on the general topic of &quot;what do we link to, and what do we suggest as alternatives?&quot;, thanks to my comment that wasn't intended to stir up trouble. It's up to you whether it stirs up trouble, not me. I viewed it as a disconcerting fact.  Sort of like when I pointed out [http://squirtage.answers.wikia.com/wiki/What_age_can_a_child_squirt this page] to Gil Penchina today (via private e-mail), I didn't intend to stir up trouble; I intended to clean up the Internet. -- [[User:Thekohser|Thekohser]] ([[User talk:Thekohser|talk]]) 20:49, 15 September 2010 (UTC)
:::I disagree. Even if I do share your preoccupation and see your criticism to the WMF and Jimbo as useful, the format seems to often be confrontational and is again  out of scope.
:::As Abd pointed out, that forum is to define that particular policy. You could have used the expressed facts in a constructive way as to make a positive change to the policy, but the question you have put forward should be raised at Meta, even if we reached any conclusion it wouldn't have an effect on the policy nor could we act on it, making the objections people are raising congruent.
:::You could have written the same post in ways that called the same attention to the problems without including the final question that indeed creates the issue Thenub314 points out.

::::That's correct, Panic. Thekohser, I assume that you realize that Panic was the prime mover behind your unblock here. The issue is not at all discomfort with facts. Suppose a business meeting of an organization was being held, to determine whether or not to sell a particular piece of property. Someone stands up at the meeting and starts talking about how the decision to buy the property, three years ago, wasn't proper, that there was self-dealing on the part of the then-President of the organization? If you were the chair of this meeting, what would you do? I know you are way more than smart enough to figure this out without a roadmap.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PVM}}

== Run Core ==

We've discussed run cores earlier, but in this chapter we are going to get into a much deeper discussion of them. Here, we are going to talk about opcodes, and the special opcode compiler that converts them into standard C code. We will also look at how these opcodes are translated by the opcode compiler into different forms, and we will see the different runcores that perform these opcodes.

== Opcodes ==

Opcodes are written using a very special syntax which is a mix of C and special keywords. Opcodes are converted by the opcode compiler, &lt;code&gt;tools/dev/ops2c.pl&lt;/code&gt; into the formats necessary for the different run cores. 

The core opcodes for Parrot are all defined in &lt;code&gt;src/ops/&lt;/code&gt;, in files with a &lt;code&gt;*.ops&lt;/code&gt; extension. Opcodes are divided into different files, depending on their purpose:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Ops file !! Purpose
|-
| bit.ops || bitwise logical operations
|-
| cmp.ops || comparison operations
|-
| core.ops || Basic Parrot operations, private internal operations, control flow, concurrency, events and exceptions.
|-
| debug.ops || ops for debugging Parrot and HLL programs.
|-
| experimental.ops || ops which are being tested, and which might not be stable. Do not rely on these ops.
|-
| io.ops || ops to handle input and output to files and the terminal.
|-
| math.ops || mathematical operations
|-
| object.ops || ops to deal with object-oriented details
|-
| obscure.ops || ops for obscure and specialized trigonometric functions
|-
| pic.ops || private opcodes for the polymorphic inline cache. Do not use these.
|-
| pmc.ops || Opcodes for dealing with PMCs, creating PMCs. Common operations for dealing with array-like PMCs (push, pop, shift, unshift) and hash-like PMCs
|-
| set.ops || ops to set and load registers
|-
| stm.ops || Ops for software transactional memory, the inter-thread communication system for Parrot. In practice, these ops are not used, use the STMRef and STMVar PMCs instead.
|-
| string.ops || Ops for working with strings
|-
| sys.ops || Operations to interact with the underlying system
|- 
| var.ops || ops to deal with lexical and global variables
|}

=== Writing Opcodes ===

Ops are defined with the &lt;code&gt;op&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and work similarly to C source code. Here is an example:

 op my_op () {
 }

Alternatively, we can use the &lt;code&gt;inline&lt;/code&gt; keyword as well:

 inline op my_op () {
 }

We define the input and output parameters using the keywords &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt;, followed by the type of input. If an input parameter is used but not altered, you can define it as &lt;code&gt;inconst&lt;/code&gt;The types can be &lt;code&gt;PMC&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;STR&lt;/code&gt; (strings), &lt;code&gt;NUM&lt;/code&gt; (floating-point values) or &lt;code&gt;INT&lt;/code&gt; (integers). Here is an example function prototype:

 op my_op(out NUM, in STR, in PMC, in INT) {
 }

That function takes a string, a PMC, and an int, and returns a num. Notice how the parameters do not have names. Instead, they correspond to numbers:

 op my_op(out NUM, in STR, in PMC, in INT)
               ^       ^       ^       ^
               |       |       |       |
              $1      $2      $3      $4

Here's another example, an operation that takes three integer inputs, adds them together, and returns an integer sum:

 op sum(out INT, in INT, in INT, in INT) {
    $1 = $2 + $3 + $4;
 }

Nums are converted into ordinary floating point values, so they can be passed directly to functions that require floats or doubles. Likewise, INTs are just basic integer values, and can be treated as such. PMCs and STRINGs, however, are complex values. You can't pass a Parrot STRING to a library function that requires a null-terminated C string. The following is bad:

 #include &lt;string.h&gt;
 op my_str_length(out INT, in STR) {
   $1 = strlen($2);  // WRONG!
 }

=== Advanced Parameters ===

When we talked about the types of parameters above, we weren't entirely complete. Here is a list of direction qualifiers that you can have in your op:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! direction !! meaning !! example
|-
| in      || The parameter is an input 
|&lt;pre&gt;
op my_op(in INT)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
| out     ||  The parameter is an output
|&lt;pre&gt;
op pi(out NUM) {
  $1 = 3.14;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
|-
| inout   ||  The parameter is an input and an output:
|&lt;pre&gt;
op increment(inout INT) {
 $1 = $1 + 1;
}
|-
| inconst || The input parameter is constant, it is not modified
| &lt;pre&gt;
op double_const(out INT, inconst INT) {
  $1 = $2 + $2;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

And, in PIR:

&lt;pre&gt;
$I0 = double_const 5 # numeric literal &quot;5&quot; is a constant
&lt;/pre&gt;  
|-
| invar   || The input parameter is a variable, like a PMC
|&lt;pre&gt;
op my_op(invar PMC)
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}

The type of the argument can also be one of several options:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! type !! meaning !! example
|-
| INT || integer value || 42 or $I0
|-
|NUM || floating-point value || 3.14 or $N3
|-
|STR || string || &quot;Hello&quot; or $S4
|-
|PMC || PMC variable || $P0
|-
|KEY || Hash key || [&quot;name&quot;]
|-
|INTKEY || Integer index || [5]
|-
|LABEL || location in code to jump to || jump_here:
|}

=== OP naming and function signatures ===

You can have many ops with the same name, so long as they have different parameters. The two following declarations are okay:

 op my_op (out INT, in INT) {
 }

 op my_op (out NUM, in INT) {
 }

The ops compiler converts these op declarations similar to the following C function declarations:

 INTVAL op_my_op_i_i(INTVAL param1) {
 }

 NUMBER op_my_op_n_i(INTVAL param1) {
 }

Notice the &quot;_i_i&quot; and &quot;_n_i&quot; suffixes at the end of the function names? This is how Parrot ensures that function names are unique in the system to prevent compiler problems. This is also an easy way to look at a function signature and see what kinds of operands it takes.

=== Control Flow ===

An opcode can determine where control flow moves to after it has completed executing. For most opcodes, the default behavior is to move to the next instruction in memory. However, there are many sorts of ways to alter control flow, some of which are very new and exotic. There are several keywords that can be used to obtain an address of an operation. We can then &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; that instruction directly, or we can store that address and jump to it later.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Keyword !! Meaning
|-
| NEXT() || Jump to the next opcode in memory
|-
|ADDRESS(a) || Jump to the opcode given by a. a is of type &lt;code&gt;opcode_t*&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
|OFFSET(a) || Jump to the opcode given by offset a from the current offset. a is typically type &lt;code&gt;in LABEL&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
|POP() || get the address given at the top of the control stack. This feature is being deprecated and eventually Parrot will be stackless internally.
|}

=== The Opcode Compiler ===

The opcode compiler is located at &lt;code&gt;dev/build/ops2c.pl&lt;/code&gt;, although most of it's functionality is located in a variety of included libs, such as &lt;code&gt;Parrot::OpsFile&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;Parrot::Ops2c::*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Parrot::OpsTrans::*&lt;/code&gt;.

We'll look at the different runcores in the section below. Suffice it to say, however, that different runcores require that the opcodes be compiled into a different format for execution. Therefore the job of the opcode compiler is relatively complex: it must read in the opcode description files and output syntactically correct C code in several different output formats.

=== Dynops: Dynamic Opcode Libraries ===

The ops we've been talking about so far are all the standard built-in ops. These aren't the only ops available however, Parrot also allows dynamic op libraries to be loaded in at runtime. 

'''dynops''' are dynamically-loadable op libraries. They are written almost exactly like regular built-in ops are, but they're compiled separately into a library and loaded in to Parrot at runtime using the &lt;code&gt;.loadlib&lt;/code&gt; directive.

== Run Cores ==

Runcores are the things that decode and execute the stream of opcodes in a PBC file. In the most simple case, a runcore is a loop that takes each bytecode value, gathers the parameter data from the PBC stream, and passes control to the opcode routine for execution.

There are several different opcores. Some are very practical and simple, some use special tricks and compiler features to optimize for speed. Some opcores perform useful ancillary tasks such as debugging and profiling. Some runcores serve no useful purpose except to satisfy some basic academic interest. 

=== Basic Cores ===

;Slow Core:In the slow core, each opcode is compiled into a separate function. Each opcode function takes two arguments: a pointer to the current opcode, and the Parrot interpreter structure. All arguments to the opcodes are parsed and stored in the interpreter structure for retrieval. This core is, as it's name implies, very slow. However, it's conceptually very simple and it's very stable. For this reason, the slow core is used as the base for some of the specialty cores we'll discuss later. 
;Fast Core: The fast core is exactly like the slow core, except it doesn't do the bounds checking and explicit context updating that the slow core does.
;Switched Core: The switch core uses a gigantic C &lt;code&gt;switch { }&lt;/code&gt; statement to handle opcode dispatching, instead of using individual functions. The benefit is that functions do not need to be called for each opcode, which saves on the number of machine code instructions necessary to call an opcode.

=== Native Code Cores ===

;JIT Core:
;Exec Core:

=== Advanced Cores ===

The two cores that we're going to discuss next rely on a specialty feature of some compilers called '''computed goto'''. In normal ANSI C, labels are control flow statements and are not treated like first-class data items. However, compilers that support compute goto allow labels to be treated like pointers, stored in variables, and jumped to indirectly.

  void * my_label = &amp;&amp;THE_LABEL;
  goto *my_label;

The computed goto cores compile all the opcodes into a single large function, and each opcode corresponds to a label in the function. These labels are all stored in a large array:

  void *opcode_labels[] = {
    &amp;&amp;opcode1,
    &amp;&amp;opcode2,
    &amp;&amp;opcode3,
    ...
  };

Each opcode value can then be taken as an offset to this array as follows:

  goto *opcode_labels[current_opcode];

;Computed Goto Core: The computed goto core uses the mechanism described above to dispatch the various opcodes. After each opcode is executed, the next opcode in the incoming bytecode stream is looked up in the table and dispatched from there.
;Predereferenced Computed Goto Core: In the precomputed goto core, the bytecode stream is preprocessed to convert opcode numbers into the respective labels. This means they don't need to be looked up each time, the opcode can be jumped to directly as if it was a label. Keep in mind that the dispatch mechanism must be used after every opcode, and in large programs there could be millions of opcodes. Even small savings in the number of machine code instructions between opcodes can make big differences in speed.

This seems a bit ridiculous. I don't really think it is needed, to an extent, it even encourages the use of drugs. Originally I didn't really think anything about it, but if you just read through it, its easy to see this is a very odd book. ([[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 22:42, 20 May 2008 (UTC))
:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' This book doesn't encourage drug use per se, it encourages '''responsible''' drug use. If anything, I think that a book about recreational drugs will actually encourage safety by allowing people to know what they're dealing with. If it weren't for websites like erowid.com (and hopefully someday, Wikibooks), I'd probably have ODed a long time ago. [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] ([[User talk:Hoogli|talk]]) 23:00, 20 May 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I don't think the page should be removed. I don't see that bringing a discussion directly to the VfD before talking to the people working on the book is the best approach (checking the editor and taking in consideration the level of content present), the proposal/issue would have easily been addressed at that level...  This type of action lead to alienating editors and create an environment that enables deletions.  
:In any case [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] stated ''it encourages '''responsible''' drug use.'', I believe that what was intended was that ''it provides guidelines to '''responsible''' drug use.'' It is clear there is no intention to violate NPOV and promote the use of drugs.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:46, 21 May 2008 (UTC)
:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' - '''Weak Keep''' - I'd be more comfortable with keeping this &quot;article&quot; if it was integrated better with the parent article. I'd like it even better if it introduced the article with a disclaimer like, &quot;If you decide to [ruin your life|ignore the safety warnings|become addicted to a habit that likely will bleed you dry of money and may result in your arrest|or something more NPOV :-) ], then you should do so in a responsible manner.&quot; My general feeling is that just because something might be objectionable, it shouldn't be censored. If someone is going to use drugs, they ''should'' be as responsible as possible about it as possible, and this article is better than nothing for explaining that. --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 07:45, May 31, 2008 (UTC)
:'''Strong Delete''' - I've said more than enough about this topic, and even answered critics [[Talk:Recreational Drug Use/General|on the talk page]], and that was more than two years ago.  In those two years, I haven't seen any reasonable or sensible clean up of the page.  It certainly doesn't fit NPOV policies, and indeed far from encouraging responsible drug usage, it encourages amateur pharmacology.  I gave the analogy to amateur nuclear engineering, and I think the comparison is fitting:  Do you really think a &quot;responsible guide&quot; on how to build nuclear weapons and avoiding regulatory authorities on processing nuclear materials is something reasonable for Wikibooks?  I don't think doing the same thing with pharmaceutical chemicals is responsible either.  There is little to be gained by the &quot;parent article&quot; from this content, and its POV is scathingly awful as well.  IMHO this page represents the worst of Wikibooks, and I'm glad that it has come up on the VfD page.  I'm willing to be patient with somebody trying to express a viewpoint and try to clean things up.  I think that time is past and this page needs to go, but I'm willing to let the community at large make up its opinion on things like this.  If there is somebody, somewhere willing to take the kernel of the idea of using drugs responsibly, I might agree to seeing that somewhere, but this simply doesn't cut it.  I highly doubt that something NPOV can be derived from the material on this page, ever.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 19:59, 4 June 2008 (UTC)
::[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' ''&quot;I gave the analogy to amateur nuclear engineering.&quot;'' I disagree with your analogy.
:: ''&quot;Do you really think a &quot;responsible guide&quot; on how to build nuclear weapons and avoiding regulatory authorities on processing nuclear materials is something reasonable for Wikibooks?&quot;'' Yes. A while back, British news reporters broke into a nuclear power plant in The UK exposing how lax security was. I've heard that the airports in The USA have suffered from similar defects. Some critisise those who bring these topics up for showing criminals what is possible. Others are grateful for the efforts made to inform those in power: the electorate.
:: I see your point of view and hope you recognise mine. I fear we'll have to respectfully disagree on this point.
:: Finally, I highly disagree that this topic can't be neutral. It is quite possible to remove overly strong wording and add countering points of view. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:00, 13 June 2008 (UTC)
:{{del}} I agree with Rob, this page was on the chopping block before [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Drugs:Fact and Fiction|[1]]] and survived because of promises that it would be improved and fixed. Also, the talk page (as Rob points out) contains all sorts of false &quot;deals&quot;, promising to improve the module if we just delay deletion a little longer. Let's face the facts: This is a blatant violation of our policies, notably our NPOV policy. It fails our tests on verifiability because most users cannot legally attempt to do so. This page is a disgusting abuse of our policies and our patience and needs to be deleted now. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:50, 4 June 2008 (UTC)
::[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I don't quite see how the [[Recreational Drug Use|Drugs:Fact_and_Fiction]] book only survived &quot;because of promises that it would be improved and fixed&quot;. There were ''demands'' from the two users who wanted it cleaned up or deleted, but the six users who argued for keeping the book did so on the merits of the topic, not promising anything.
:: I, furthermore, don't see the &quot;false `deals`&quot; on the talk pages (neither [[Talk:Recreational Drug Use|Talk:Drugs:Fact and Fiction]] nor [[Talk:Recreational Drug Use/General|Talk:Drugs:Fact and Fiction/General]]). [[Talk:Recreational Drug Use|Talk:Drugs:Fact and Fiction]] does have an appeal from the original author not to delete it. This, however, dates back to the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Recreational_Drug_Use&amp;oldid=302530 8th of December, 2005], 23 days before the the first day the book was precedes the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Requests_for_deletion&amp;diff=350663&amp;oldid=350615 VfD nomination] by about seven weeks. Seen in context, the &quot;plea&quot; was put there after [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Recreational_Drug_Use&amp;diff=302176&amp;oldid=302034 an edit] that deleted a section and added a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cleanup|not linked - add to a bookshelf}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag.
:: As for the facts. I don't see the consensus that this book is NPOV. If there are disagreements about how to present it, I'd echo [[User:Robert Horning]]'s call for [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Recreational_Drug_Use&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=352036 being BOLD]. I don't think we need users to be able to verify statements themselves. If one sees a questionable statement adding a [[Template:Fact]] should be the first step. There is, actually, research done on this topic. The [http://www.newscientist.com/ New Scientist], for example, has a section on [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/drugs-alcohol drugs and alcohol]. I don't agree with personal anecdotes as being very useful for any topic. [http://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/drugs-alcohol/mg19125624.700-medical-cannabis-is-a-blunt-tool.html It seems] to be especially true about this topic. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:35, 16 June 2008 (UTC)
:::I never said that this '''topic''' could never be presented as NPOV.  I merely said that what is written here is never going to reach that point, regardless of how you massage the text.  I'm a little disappointed that you closed the discussion when you clearly were taking sides in the argument, but I'll leave it as it is.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 03:13, 20 June 2008 (UTC)
:{{keep}} I'm not really sure how one would verify a statement like 'know your drug before you use it'.  Nothing on this page encourages drug use.  It doesn't discourage it either which is a nice change from the many publications which try to discourage people from using drugs by lying to them - doing something like that would even encourage many people to try drugs. --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:49, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

Per Rob, the whole thing should be binned.

:{{keep}} This page may not be the finest on Wikibooks, but I don't see the blantant violation of policy. There is furthermore no ro requirement in Wikibook policies that books/modules be cleaned up in any time frame. Collaboration on an under-staffed project like this one takes time. Leaving the material provides a starting point for someone who comes along. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 02:36, 11 June 2008 (UTC)
:{{keep}} I think this book could be very useful as a sound, unbiased guide to entheogens, their usage, and their role in society. For instance, so as to not &quot;condone illicit use&quot;, it could be presented as: &quot;Here's group X, and this is how group X uses drug Y.&quot; Ways in which drug Y influences group X can also be explored, as well. (e.g. How LSD usage among hippies fueled psychedelic art: drawings, paintings, acid rock, etc.) A history of drug prohibition, especially the current &quot;War on Drugs&quot;, would be very informative as well. These are all valid fields of study. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] ([[User talk:PurplePieman|talk]]) 05:58, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

== IMCC and PIRC ==

IMCC and PIRC are two separate parsers for PIR and PASM. Both are written using Lex and Yacc.

== IMCC ==

IMCC, the '''Intermediate Code Compiler''' is the current front-end for Parrot that reads PASM and PIR code. It's a relatively old subsystem, and has proven itself difficult to extend or maintain. IMCC will likely be the &quot;offical&quot; parser for PIR and PASM until the Parrot 1.0 release. However, the plan for the future is to move to a more extensible and more manageable parser, such as PIRC.

IMCC is written using a combination of a Lex tokenizer and a Yacc parser. It includes a number of components, such as register allocators, and code optimizers.

== PIRC ==

PIRC is, in theory anyway, a better alternative to parsing PIR and PASM than IMCC is. However, PIRC is not currently complete, and does not offer the feature set of IMCC yet. There are two different implementations of PIRC: one is a hand-written recursive descent parser, and the other is based on a multi-stage Lex/Yacc parser. The old version, the hand-written recursive descent version, is obsolete and is no longer maintained. We will only talk about the new implementation of PIRC here. 

PIRC is divided into three different parsers:
# A parser for &quot;Heredoc&quot; constructs, strings which are embedded directly into the file.
# A macro parser and text replacer. This is a preprocessor for handling macros and constants.
# A parser for the rest of PIR and PASM

Breaking things up like this proves to keep things much more simple, and reduces the number of states and conditionals that a single large parser would require.

== PIRC Current Status ==

{{info|PIRC is under active development, and it's state may change rapidly. This page may become obsolete. Always refer to the latest documentation in the Parrot repository to get more accurate information about Parrot's current state.}}

PIRC is intended to replace IMCC as the primary front-end to Parrot. However, this changeover might not be made until after the 1.0 release of Parrot. In other words, it's an important development, but the Parrot developers aren't going to wait around for it.

== JIT and NCI ==

JIT, the '''Just in time compiler''' is a system which compiles Parrot opcodes into native machine code for faster execution. NCI, the '''native call interface''' is a subsystem in Parrot that allows it to communicate with compiled library functions. These two systems are very important for Parrot and, as we shall see, they are closely related to one another.

== help me! ==

I need to add images to a book. How do I add pictures I found on Wikipedia?

[[User:Lunakeet|Lunakeet]] ([[User talk:Lunakeet|talk]]) 14:06, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

:It's actually not an uncommon question, and one that we should probably answer in a help page somewhere (if we don't already). Here are some things you could try:
;Best: Click on the image on wikipedia, this will bring you to an information page about the picture. If the picture says that it's from Wikimedia Commons, then you win: Images on commons can be used immediately on any Wikimedia project (Wikipedia AND wikibooks).
;Good: If the image is not on commons, you can probably move it. Go to the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;uselang=fromwikimedia Commons upload page], follow the directions, and have the image moved. Once it is on commons, it can be used immediately on Wikibooks.
;Fair: You can download the image from Wikipedia and upload it directly here to Wikibooks. When doing this, you MUST faithfully reproduce the licensing information, and properly attribute the original author. If you do not, the image will be deleted here. 
I hope this helps you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:57, 5 June 2008 (UTC)
== Hello ==

Hi, I am new around here; I started editing at WP a few months ago. At the moment I focus at rewriting at WP the [[w:History of democracy|History of democracy]] and [[w:Eleftherios Venizelos|Eleftherios Venizelos]] (biography of a greek prime minister). I can contribute on other topics such as chess, physics, maths and history (mainly ancient and medieval). Best wishes, [[User:A.Cython|A.Cython]] ([[User talk:A.Cython|talk]]) 00:38, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

:Hello A.Cython, welcome to wikibooks! We're always happy to have new members around here, and if you've been to WP then you should be up to speed on all the technical details about editing. You will find that our environment here is slower, more relaxed, and less stressful. Some people like that, some people don't. Chess, physics, math, history? We need help in all those areas! Take a look around, find a project that you like, and dive right in! If you have any questions, let us know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:43, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

::Thanks! I do have a question, I just looked at the [[World History]] (the Ancient Greece is underdeveloped) and seems that I will contribute there, at some point. However, since I am a newbie and not a native speaker of the English language I would be grateful if you could show me a couple high quality wiki books. I want to check the style and the way of organizing the references. Thanks in advance. [[User:A.Cython|A.Cython]] ([[User talk:A.Cython|talk]]) 01:05, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

== Greetings ==

Hello, I'm a new user, of course. I'm happy to be part of the wikibooks community and would be willing to help in any way I can, (strong points are Computers (I'm taking the Cisco IT training course to get Net+ and A+ certifications here in 2 or so years) and I'm going to try to help the Japanese Wikibook if i can) so if you need me to do research on anything or help fix pages / revert vandalism, just drop me a message, I'll be on when i can, or if we have a meeting or something like that where we start doing some kind of planning, I'll try to jump on then.

And I apologize in advance for any lapses in spelling I may have, I'm fairly good, but I play games a lot so i may slip back. &gt;.&lt;
[[User:Cysaki|Cysaki]] ([[User talk:Cysaki|talk]]) 02:01, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

:Hello Cysaki, welcome to wikibooks! More computer people is always good, we have a large number of computer books and many of those need some help. If you're interested in doing relevant stuff, you can take a look at [[Network Plus Certification]], [[Networking]], and [[A+ Certification]]. When I was still a student, I found that working on related wikibooks was a good way for me to study for my classes. You don't have to work on these books, we have [[WB:AS|hundreds of other books]] that you can look at, and all sorts of [[WB:WM|maintenance projects]] that you could work on as well. I think [[User:Swift]] was starting to do some cleanup work on [[Japanese]], so you might be able to work with him to make that project go more smoothly. 
:We don't have any kind of planning meetings, although sometimes I wish we did. However, if you come on to IRC at [irc://irc.freenode.net/wikibooks #Wikibooks] on Freenode.net, a few of us chat there. Otherwise, we can always chat here on wiki too, if you need anything. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:19, 11 June 2008 (UTC)
== Uploading Images ==

Hallo - I am new to Wikibooks and struggling a little trying to upload some images.  I have been commissioned to write a help manual for some software and in order to make the help as explicit as possible I have taken a load of screenshots and annotated them.  
I have tried to &quot;upload files&quot; and am told that I do not have administrator permissions.
I have looked at &quot;Wikimedia Commons&quot; but the amount of information I am asked to provide for each image uploaded is more than I was writing in the manual to start with!

There must be an easy way to do this - but I need some direction.

thank you in anticipation
[[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 19:46, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

:This is a common problem, and one that maybe we need to consider fixing. New users are restricted from uploading images here until they are &quot;autoconfirmed&quot;. What this means is that the account must be at least 4 days old before you can start uploading images here. We do this to help cut down on image-based vandalism, where miscreants upload things like pornography. Wikimedia commons doesn't require autoconfirmation, but then again (as you mentioned) they require a lot of information from you. Of course, we require information about copyright status on the images too, but if it's the same for all the images then you can copy+paste it.
:How many images do you have? I might be able to help you with the uploading if you can't wait for autoconfirmation. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:08, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

== Abyssal has some questions... ==

One thing I've noticed here is an almost complete lack of references/inline citations in the various articles. I'd like to contribute specific information on keeping and breeding reptiles and amphibians from a book I have, but would be loathe to not credit the book's author. How is attribution supposed to be handled here?

Also, what exactly is the difference between Wikipedia and Wikibooks? I understand that this place covers some material that Wikipedia excludes (such as how-tos), but could some please elaborate on the differences in detail? For instance what would be included in the Dinosaur Wikibook that wouldn't be included in Wikipedia's Dinosaur Category articles?

Any help for this noob would be greatly appreciated. :D [[User:Abyssal leviathin|Abyssal leviathin]] ([[User talk:Abyssal leviathin|talk]]) 15:46, 14 June 2008 (UTC)

:Here at wikibooks we've generally taken the stance that references could be credited in a separate chapter called &quot;bibliography&quot; or &quot;references&quot; or whatever. This is how things are done in most books, where citations are not usually made inline, but references to sources are made at the end of individual chapters, or at the end of the book. However, this is all up to the author, and you are free to use inline citations if you wish. To create a citation, use the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; and &lt;/ref&gt; tags to create your citation inline, and then use the &lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag where you want the footnotes to appear. The page is parsed from top-to-bottom, so the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag only displays the notes that appear above it.
:The differences between Wikipedia and Wikibooks are numerous. Wikipedia is about collection and display of information, wikibooks is about the teaching and conveying of knowledge.  Wikipedia displays information in an &quot;encyclopedic&quot; way, Wikibooks attempts to teach that information to students. This means that articles at WP tend to be individual, but pages here on wikibooks are formed into books where each page builds on the information presented before. A Wikibook also needs to consider the target audience, and present information that will be understandable to them. Where the Wikipedia article on [[w:Color]] is written in a single way, we would brake that up for different audiences like [[Wikijunior:Colors]] for children, and more advanced books for older readers. I hope this answers your questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:48, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

== can u help me to settle up my C++ programming assingment ==

Actually I have a problem to do my new one assingment in c++ programming for my study...can anybody help me to settle up that assignment? I really don't know how to do it because I fresher in this C++ programming and not expert in this subject..
The question are like this:

A company runs it bussiness by selling houses.The company will get a commission of 7% of the ttal selling price of the house  of the month. The house type sold is given code 'A' for landed house and code 'B' for apartment. The company has asked you to develop a computerized list of sold houses. Assume that the total number of houses sold everymonth is at most 30.Write a C++ program to:

i) read the input data from file;
ii) display the input data in an output file;
iii) sort the data from the lowest to the highest selling price and then display the sorted list in the output file;
iv) calculate the number of houses sold, the total selling prices, the average of the houses selling price and the company commission;
v) display the calculation results in (iv) above in the output file.

The program should be develop in modular form. The program should at least include the following function:
a) void read_data (...) to read the input data from a file;
b) void display_list (...) to display the input data;
c) void sorted_list(...) to sort and display the input data;
d) void compute_result(...) to calculate the items in (iv) above;
e) void isplay_result (...) to display the calculation result in (iv) above.

The input data must be stored as arrays.Display the output in an output file.The program must read the input data until the 'end of file' is false.Make sure the program is not interactive and do not use global variables.

Thanks a lot to anybody who help me to complete the answer for my question...Thanks a million..

Sorry, but this isn't the place to be asking a question like that. Try reading the C++ programming book if you need C++ help. [[User:PiemanXC|PiemanXC]] ([[User talk:PiemanXC|talk]]) 21:42, 5 June 2008 (UTC)







== FlaggedRevs Extension Live on DE.WP ==

The FlaggedRevs extension is gone live on de.wikipedia, and it's an extension that I think we should bring here as quickly as possible. There are many possible configurations available for this extension, although I think we can copy what the Germans are doing for now, and make tweaks to our implementation later if we decide we want them. Here, in a nutshell, is what FlaggedRevs does:

#Allows certain users to be able to &quot;flag&quot; a particular revision of a page. We can choose the user group that we want to give this privledge to (all users, autoconfirmed, patroller/rollbacker, admin, etc). I would venture to guess that giving flagging rights to autoconfirmed users (users with an account more then 4 days old) should be given this right no problem.
#When users come to the page, they can be shown the most current &quot;development&quot; version, or they can see the latest &quot;flagged&quot; version instead. There will probably be an extra tab or extra button or something that would allow people to change between them. We can set it (as I recommend) for readers to see the most recent flagged version, and logged-in users (editors) to see the current development version. Pages which are not flagged will always display the current development version by default.

What this extension does is make it so that readers can see &quot;good&quot; vandalism-free versions of a page. This is a ''must-have requirement'' for us if we want to be making inroads into schools. Teachers do not take kindly to textbooks for young children being filled with vandalism over night. Showing students a vandalism-free version of the page by default would help to reduce many of these concerns. In addition, having &quot;stabilized&quot; versions of pages would help in the construction of PDF versions and published books, which we haven't really gotten involved with yet (but I hope we will!). I would like to get some opinions on configuration settings, and if people do't have too many major complaints I would like to ask the devs to install this extension for us ASAP. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:19, 8 May 2008 (UTC)
:Just to note that there are two user groups introduced by this feature. ''Editors'' may sight a version - I think patrollers or emailconfirmed is fine for that. ''Reviewers'' can review a version (ie a higher level of quality)  - this, I think, should be done by admins, as the highest level of review will be used only for [[WB:FB|Featured Books]]; there is no great need for many users reviewing stuff.
:There are tons of [[mw:Extension:FlaggedRevs#Configuration|config]] options. I will make a [[User:Mike.lifeguard/FlaggedRevs|page]] outlining the exact configuration I'd like to see. It'll be lots of info, and somewhat technical, so it'll be over there. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:17, 8 May 2008 (UTC)
::I would disagree with you a ''tiny little bit'' about user rights. Assuming we want to differentiate between &quot;sighted&quot; and &quot;reviewed&quot; at all (which we probably don't since we don't have the critical mass right now to be making multiple passes over every page), I would say that '''Sighted''' abilities should be given to all autoconfirmed users, and '''Reviewer''' abilities should be given to anybody with +patroller, +rollbacker, or higher (admins, etc). Many books are overseen by authors who are not admins and are not particularly interested in the politics here, and they should be given the tools to sight good pages in their own books without having to jump through hoops (hence, autoconfirmed). The people that we already trust to oversee content and make decisions about quality (rollbackers and patrollers) should get better tools as well. I definitely look forward to seeing your writeup on all the config options. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:05, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

:::I think we ''do'' want to differentiate between sighted and reviewed. If you look at my [[User:Mike.lifeguard/FlaggedRevs|suggestions]], we can autopromote users to Editor (ie they can sight pages). That plus the ability to autoreview in certain cases boots the level at which flagging will happen. I think if we autopromote users to ''Editor'' and give all patrollers &amp; admins ''Reviewer'' we'll have enough hands to make this work. Editors may flag up to the stable level (Editors are autopromoted, so there is not much load). When autopromoting users to editor status we allow the people who know a book best (it's authors) to flag it up to stable level. The threshold for autopromotion should be relatively high (certainly higher than autoconfirmed) so we don't have users doing this who are unfamiliar with how things work. Admins and patrollers may flag up to the featured level (this would be after a [[WB:FBN|FBN]], so not much workload, therefore not much need for many to have those permissions). Stable and Featured are &quot;quality&quot; revisions (ie shown be default whenever possible). &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:33, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

=== Available Options ===

I want to list out some of the possible configuration options here, so we all understand exactly what decisions need to be made. 

;Namespaces:Flagging revisions will only happen in certain namespaces. Mike suggests main, cookbook, wikijunior, image, and template namespaces. I'm tempted to add the &quot;Wikibooks:&quot; namespace too, just because most of those pages are important and shouldn't be messed around with by most users. Then again, partial page protection could serve the same purpose over there.
;How Pages Are Reviewed:We don't just say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to a page being stable, we also have the ability to grade the page against certain metrics. Mike suggests we have metrics like, &quot;references&quot;, &quot;prose&quot;, &quot;spelling &amp; grammar&quot;, and &quot;structure&quot;. For sighting pages, this is fine because it can be done on a per-page basis. However, if we want to use the ''reviewed'' state to denote our featured books, we will want the whole book to be featured and not be giving bad grades to one or two pages.
;How many levels of page quality are there?:Mike suggests 4: useful, good quality, stable, and featured. I might even be willing to drop this down to 3 and do some rearranging (stable, good, featured) or even just 2 (good, featured). The more levels we have, the more of a hassle it could be determining where boundary cases go. Featured books are determined from [[WB:FBN]], good pages can be a person opinion of the reviewer. Adding additional levels seems like overkill to me for now. Of course, as our system is currently, non-admins can promote a book to featured. If we require +reviewer rights to set this on featured books, then normal users cannot do this anymore.
;What should people see when they go to a reviewed page?: When a person goes to a page, should they see the current development version, or the current sighted version? We can split this up according to user group. I suggest that &quot;readers&quot; (people who are not logged in) should see the current stable version by default. Logged-in &quot;editors&quot; would see the current development version by default. 
;Should we allow user comments?:There is an option to allow comments from the reviewer. These are like an edit summary, but when you review a page. I say yes, Mike agrees.
;What flags can different user groups give out?:If we have '''reviewer''' and '''editor''' groups, we need to determine which flags each group can distribute. In a 2-level scheme, editors can hand out the &quot;good&quot; rating on personal opinion, Reviewers can hand out &quot;Featured&quot; in response to [[WB:FBN]]. If we have three levels, an editor can mark pages as &quot;stable&quot;, a reviewer can hand out &quot;good&quot; (on personal opinion or nomination) and &quot;Featured&quot; (in response to [[WB:FBN]]). I don't think that more levels buys us anything in terms of usability. 
There are a few other options that we can manipulate, but I don't think any of them are too important. I default to Mike's suggestions on all additional options. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:51, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

:I personally wouldn't mind a three-level scheme in some places, but as a whole I think it is too much maintenance and overhead for something simple. Here's what I want: anonymous users will see the stable or featured version by default, and logged in users the development copy. Only admins can be reviewers and thus mark pages as featured. Patrollers / rollbackers (and by default admins) can sight and mark pages as stable. This allows a quality crew of people to make the real content decisions and leaves only the high-level featuring of work to the admins (which is relatively rare). I absolutely don't want any autoconfirmed user coming into my book and making decisions on what quality is, and ideally I'd only want my team of editors to flag my book but that's not possible. This feature deserves little usage on the production side and heavy usage on the reader side, so I'd like to keep it tight. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:36, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

::I certainly don't mean to lecture you or anything, but it doesn't really seem like the &quot;wiki way&quot; to limit decision-making to only a select core &quot;team&quot;. I definitely understand your motivations for that, and I don't entirely disagree with it either. A three-level scheme that was essentially &quot;vandalism-free&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;Featured&quot; would probably be acceptable. Any ordinary autoconfirmed joe-schmoe user can verify that a page does not contain vandalism.

:::It's not possible to have sub-groups so discussing the matter won't do us much good, but although I definitely believe this place should be free for editing, if we want to really establish ourselves as professional we need to limit access. I think the stable revision goes along with what the expectations of a patroller are, even higher actually since the flag should be given not to just a vandalism-free page but a revision that is clearly finished in some regard and not caught up with loose ends. If we wanted to have a third group for &quot;vandalism-free&quot; that's fine with me, but I don't really want that to be the version displayed to readers as it's only the first level of editing.

::::I agree with you, but even amongst admins we can't limit what books people mark as what. As a matter of courtesy I probably wouldn't go marking &quot;good&quot; pages in the Muggle's guide, but that doesn't mean that I couldn't if the whim so struck me. I agree entirely about the need for a stable version, teachers absolutely won't use our books unless we have some measure of stability (and this extension is probably just one of many steps we would need to take to get to that point). Readers in general have gotten along just fine looking at pages that are generally free from vandalism, and where that was the only option, it would be better then nothing. Books which are well watched-over and well cared-for would obviously reach higher levels of stable quality, and those higher levels would be shown to the reader instead. We simply don't have the manpower to raise every page of every book to &quot;good&quot; level and require that only &quot;good&quot; pages be shown to readers by default, we are going to need some gradiations, I think, and we are going to have to live with the fact that the majority of our pages will never be sighted anyway. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:36, 8 May 2008 (UTC)

=== Features Page ===

In order to have the FlaggedRevs extension installed here, we need to create a page with our list of configuration options, so the devs can see them all in one place. I have created a page like this here: [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension]], also I have populated it with the proposal that [[User:Mike.lifeguard]] created. I also made one change, reducing the number of flagging levels for a page from 4 to 3. We can use that page to talk about further options, discuss conflicts, and try to reach a concensus on our desired extension configuration. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:51, 4 June 2008 (UTC)

== A horrible thought ==

I'm thinking of renaming [[A Wikimanual of Gardening]] to [[Horticulture]]. The name is a bit too long, and stems from some rather odd advice I recieved when I first arrived on the project. Admittedly, I haven't done a lot of work on it lately, but would like to have it easier to link to from Wikipedia and so on, and maybe a more toned down title will help attract contributors in any case. 

This would be a s**tload of pagemoves (and an even more massive need for re-interwiki-linking!), but I'd like to see the book growing again. The other issue is of course the [[Gardening]] book, which remains primarily a copy of a very old PD book which was partially moved to Wikisource a few years ago (I haven't been able to figure out what title it's under there though, and the person who originally started moving it around anymore). Most of the pages aren't particularly useful (very old info), and are rather POV-ish (the author was not averse to sprinkling in editorial comments and preferences into the text). I'm not sure though about moving WMOG to that name though, since it has a far more technical approach. --[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[meta:Wikimedia Pennsylvania|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;PA!&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:38, 27 May 2008 (UTC)

== Christianity books ==

I've noticed that there is a rather pronounced lack of material relating to the general subject of Christianity here. It is remotely possible that I might be able to do something to address that situation. If I were to try to do so, are there any particular suggestions as to which kind would be best? Perhaps, for example, a history of Christianity, or just of a single church within Christianity, or the sacraments and liturgies, or something else? Any suggestions? [[User:Warlord John Carter|John Carter]] ([[User talk:Warlord John Carter|talk]]) 22:38, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

: I recommended, starting one that your interested in writing about, and know something about. It can be as broad or specific as you want, just try to make sure that what you decide on is clear from the title of the book and from the description of its scope. Avoid bias, generalizing or taking a specific stance on Christianity, because those have been some of problems that have popped up before when writing books about religion here. Also try to be as specific as possible when talking about a specific denomination, keep it balanced and fact based, those will go a long way towards making a good book here that will last. Needless to say religion I believe has been a controversial topic here that's been difficult to cover within Wikibooks [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]] requirements. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:12, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

:: Many of the books which are created on Christianity tend to be shit.  They're either full of Bible quotations or NPOV babble.

::: I had classes in college about the history of judeo-christian religion. The class covered mostly history, with some analytical readings of certain bible passages (more like &quot;you notice the contradictions here?&quot; and less like &quot;notice how great god is?&quot;). The professor was agnostic, and many in the class were athesists, so discussion was lively and secular. ''Those'' kinds of topics are fine here, the &quot;god is good&quot; kinds of books are not.

== I don't like the slogan ==

I have this feeling that this point was raised in the past, but I'm unable to find any relevant discussion, so. Can we change the slogan &quot;Think free. Learn free&quot;? What I don't like about the slogan is that the word &quot;Learn&quot;, which, in my opinion, cheapens textbooks or the idea of the self-study or formal or informal teaching using them. I'm contributing mostly to math books. I don't want readers to get an idea that math is just about learning how to do stuff (e.g., do calculation, apply formulas, etc) and math books tell you how to do that quick and easily. That's not the point at all. Math textbooks (at least not ones for kids) are meant to develop the theory and by doing so they aim to help you deepen the understanding of mathematics. This is clearly more than just &quot;learning&quot; or something you can learn from someone or some books. (And I don't want to go to the grammatical problem of the current slogan or the clichedness? of &quot;think free&quot;. &quot;think free&quot; sounds too trite to me, not to mention &quot;think different&quot;, which is way cooler.) If I am not alone in this thinking, can we come up with something cooler? -- [[User:TakuyaMurata|Taku]] ([[User talk:TakuyaMurata|talk]]) 08:54, 30 May 2008 (UTC)

:I've never liked the slogan either. However, I don't think it's an official slogan so much as it is an artifact of the logo. I don't think anybody chose a slogan separately, it was always just part of the logo. I would love to change it, and i would like to maybe solicit some suggestions from people about it. 
:One problem is that this isn't the &quot;only&quot; wikibooks, there are wikibooks projects in over 120 languages. A slogan that we change here doesn't need to be mirrored on the other projects necessarily, but there is going to be some pressure to do so. Any slogan that we choose, therefore, probably has to take into account nuances and differences in many languages, not just english. This makes the task a little more difficult, and we end up stuck with the current slogan out of sheer inertia. 
:However, it's still something to think about, and maybe it's something that we should pursue. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 04:57, 2 June 2008 (UTC)

:::I have checked google about this and it seems Kansas was about to rule on copyright for lecture notes but can't find the outcome (probably to soon), I found also this page [http://www.ua.edu/academic/facsen/docs/copyrnew.html AA committee discussed the sale of class notes by various commercial companies. 2000].

:::: Many thanks for your research. That's a very interesting page you provide. There does remain the question of whether the notes in question are copies or derivative work. My experience with science lectures is that the lecturer writes a series of structured lectures and then presents them to the students, most of whom copy it verbatim. In that case, it is a copy of a work already created. If the memorandum applies, I can't see how we can get around asking the uploader whether these are copies of the lecturer's notes, or deviate substantially enough to be considered a derived work. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:28, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

== Copyright tag question, uploaded images, all taken from commons (GDFL or PD) and cropped by me ==

Hi, folks. I'm snagging some photos of plants and animals uploaded on commons, and cropping  them for use here in the [[Field Guide]]. Example [[Field_Guide/Birds_-_British_Isles/Passeriformes_Thumbnails#Swallows_and_Martins|here]], which leads off with the photo [[:Image:Tree-Swallow-27527-3-crop.jpg|here]]. (The cropped images are for use in a large thumbnail gallery showing a large number of related species. The purpose is to allow users to scan all the species of a general type, narrow down the specific species they're looking for, and then consult the detail page(s) for the most likely candidate(s). The more detailed the thumbnail is, the more useful it is. So when pastures and fence posts and whatnot consume over half the image real estate, I crop it.)

My question, I didn't see a choice in the copyright tag pull-down menu for public domain, someone else's work, or perhaps it should be called a derivative work? I'm guessing there's a better way to fill out the summary information than the method I chose. If so, would somebody be kind enough to point me in the right direction?

== FireFox 3 Download Day ==

Today is '''FireFox 3 Download Day'''. The new version of the browser has been released, and they are trying to set a Guinness record for the most downloads of a single piece of software in a single day. Firefox is a good browser to use with Wikibooks because most of our cool JavaScript gadgets work better in FF then in Internet Explorer. Some fancy CSS formatting works better too. Wikibooks is certainly very usable with IE, and will always be so, of course.

The open source software movement is closely related to the open content movement, and FireFox is one of the most visible and most successful open source projects.

== WMF Board of Trustees Election ==

There is currently an open election for a new member for the WMF board of trustees. [[User:Anthere]], the current chairman of the board (A woman who has been sympathetic to the sister projects, and on occasion has offered specific help here) is stepping down and her chair needs to be replaced. I think only the one seat is open for election.

A list of all candidates is posted here: [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Board_elections/2008/Candidates/en]. 

Last year, there were some hot tempers and polarizing ideas running around concerning the sister projects, like wikibooks. For people who have never heard the term, &quot;Sister projects&quot; are all the projects which are not Wikipedia (Wikibooks, Wikiversity, Wikinews, Wikisource, etc). Traditionaly, the sister projects have been treated as less important then Wikipedia is, for a number of reasons. Last year, these feelings came to a point, and I made recommendations for and against certain candidates based on their opinions towards Wikibooks and the other sister projects. This year, things seem to be more calm on that front, and I won't make any specific recommendations (several of the candidates are still very WP-centric, however). 

Users who have more then 600 edits prior to May 1st, and at least 50 edits here since then are eligible to vote. I know that this disenfranchises some users, but it was decided at the foundation-level and cannot be changed.

I encourage all Wikibookians to read over the candidates and their statements, and vote at [[Special:Boardvote]]. This is a great way for Wikibooks to get involved in the foundation. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:25, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

:::Some interesting answers particularly from Gregory Kohs, I must confess i took a look at the chapters he was talking about and although i am no expert on American History i could see his point. I took a look at the discussion pages of the chapters to which he refers also and indeed there is talk of inaccurate information in the chapters. If a featured book has disputes about accuracy should it still be featured? On the other hand Wikibooks is a different beast to wikipedia, putting together a whole book from an NPOV is a skill in itself and on history and with all the different nationalities involved in the editing of these books nigh on impossible. Makes you wonder how the wikibook space on the web could be evolved to take account of all the opinions in a text book format and still maintain an NPOV. [[User:Barry Sharpe|Barry]] ([[User talk:Barry Sharpe|talk]]) 19:51, 18 June 2008 (UTC)
::::You're right Barry, and Greg is right too. However, his criticisms of this project aren't entirely unexpected or inaccurate. The bar here is far lower then it is at Wikipedia, it's a function of manpower: We've been in a &quot;habit&quot; (for lack of a more appropriate word) of ''one book, one author''. Even with our long history of forbidding forks, we've been hard-pressed to get much &quot;group&quot; activity on any of our books, with the exception of class projects (which are organized off-site).
::::In making a book &quot;featured&quot;, we tend to do so based on it's size, structure, formatting. With one book per author, we can't possibly expect that we will achieve the benefits of regular wiki projects: NPOV, accuracy, quality. One person can carry a baton so far, and we should commend good efforts even if the result isn't polished and brilliant. Problems with spelling, grammar, facts, these are all things that would be fixed if there were more eyes looking and more hands working, things that we don't have in high abundance. If we demanded perfection, we would not have now, nor would we have ever, any books listed as &quot;featured&quot;. We do not demand perfection, we only inch our way towards it, setting reasonable goals and incrementally raising our expectations.
::::If a book is featured here, it is because the book is better then most books, and serves as a good example for new books. It is precisely why we never call our books &quot;finished&quot;. As the bar gets raised, necessarily some of our featured books will fall below it and will be replaced. I would love to see what Wikipedia's featured articles looked like, back when it was the same size as Wikibooks. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:06, 18 June 2008 (UTC)
:::::Having been working on Wikipedia lately a bit more than Wikibooks, I'd like to point out something:  A great many articles on Wikipedia are also &quot;one article, one author&quot; types as well.  I've written a few even.  Using this criteria as a complaint about Wikibooks can be focused right back at Wikipedia and be just as damaging there as it is here.  Featured books are similar to Featured Articles on Wikipedia, and the standard is incredibly high for something like that.
:::::Karl Wick's [[Organic Chemistry]] is the oldest of all Wikibooks, and IMHO a good book to measure the overall progress of this project.  No, Karl isn't the only person who ever worked on the book, but his style and outline certainly is a dominant feature.  I'd also say that for good or ill, this book is also what has set the standard for how Wikibooks were organized.  A few minor tweaks and improvements in style since them for some other books that IMHO are of much better quality, but it is something good to fall back onto if you want to see the roots of this project.  It also is a showcase to both the problems and the solutions we have faced at trying to organize collaboratively written books.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 04:02, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

== Adding graphs ==

:Unfortunately, there is no automatic way to create graphs in the wiki (i wish there was!), so anything you want to do will have to be by hand. Create images on your own computer and upload them here. That's the most direct way, at the moment. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:46, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

:: Yes, I agree with Whitenight -- except for the part about &quot;upload them here&quot;. It's often better to upload them to Commons (see [[Help:Uploading Images]] for details).
:: Also, I disagree with the part about &quot;no automatic way&quot; -- there is an automatic way that doesn't work very well :-). The [[mw:Extension:EasyTimeline]] can automatically draw a few kinds of very simple graphs, although most people find it too limiting and draw their own graphs anyway.
:: If you have already drawn the images, please upload them in whatever format you have them in, and tag with &quot;public domain&quot; or whatever copyright tag is appropriate.
:: If you haven't drawn the images already, you might find the tips in [[Help:Graphics tutorials]] useful.
:: In particular, saving computer-generated graphs in JPEG causes weird artifacts, so eventually (unless you fix them first) someone will convert those images to (better) PNG or GIF or (best) SVG format.

== [[WB:FBN]] ==

I would like to try to get some more people involved at [[WB:FBN]], where we nominate new books for featured status. This is a quick and easy way to get involved in the community more, and also to affect the level of quality that we display on the main page and also the level that we expect other books to rise to. Here are some things that people could do:
#If you find a good book, nominate it! Anybody can nominate a book, and there are lots of good books out there worthy of being nominated (and more being created every day!)
#Discuss the current nominations, every wikibookian from from absolute newest to the oldest gets a fair say in them.
#Close nominations when they have reached a solid level of support or opposition. You don't need to be an admin to close a nomination, anybody can do it if you are patient and reasonable. We have at least two outstanding nominations that likely could be closed soon, if somebody were up to the task. 
Again, [[WB:FBN]] is a great way for people to get involved, and we need a lot more involvement around here. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:50, 19 June 2008 (UTC)
:Following the &quot;issues&quot; with the US history book, I wonder if we should try and have some sort of regular review of our featured books to ensure that the standard of them is kept high.  I thought of perhaps trying to review all of our featured books once every six months?  It could be a good way to get new users involved in the community by getting people to read through the featured books and offer their opinions.  The way I thought it could work is using this page [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Review]] (an initial stab at it so far, but should give the outline of what I am thinking).  Then have a template on the top of all our featured books something along the lines of &quot;Get involved in wikibooks review this book!&quot;, which could be removed once the book had been reviewed in the current 6 month period.  It could be an easy way for people who come here just to read the information to get involved.  What do people think?  If people think this could work then I'll put some effort into getting a template together and tidying up the page some more. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 12:31, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

Nominate it to be featured. Read a featured book and thought it wasn't all that good? Nominating it to be unfeatured.&quot; That's not to say if people feel like reviewing books every 6 months that they shouldn't.

== [[US History]] - is this a wider problem? ==

The request to have US History removed from the list of featured books seems to me to be part of a wider debate about how we offer books to readers.

Perhaps there could be three categories of books:

# Featured books - books that are an example to others.
# Substantial books - books that have substantial content.
# Other books.

Readers need to know which books have substantial content and which are just skeletons awaiting fleshing out. The term &quot;substantial&quot; does not carry any judgement about the quality of presentation, just that there is a substantial content. Nominations for &quot;Substantial books&quot; would be based on factual accuracy and coverage rather than adherence to stylistic conventions etc.  

This scheme could be implemented by changing the title for &quot;featured books&quot; to &quot;substantial books&quot; and then highlighting the subset of &quot;featured books&quot; within this list. ie:

{{PDF|Acoustics}}
&amp;mdash; {{PDF|Ada Programming}}
&amp;mdash; '''&lt;font color=green&gt;[[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]]&lt;/font&gt;'''
&amp;mdash; [[Algorithms]]
&amp;mdash; [[Anatomy and Physiology of Animals]]
&amp;mdash; {{PDF|Applications of ICT in Libraries}}
&amp;mdash; {{PDF|Arimaa}}
&amp;mdash; {{PDF|Basic Computing Using Windows}}
&amp;mdash; {{PDF|Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine}}
&amp;mdash; {{PDF|Blended Learning in K-12}}
&amp;mdash; {{PDF|Blender 3D: Noob to Pro}}
&amp;mdash; '''&lt;font color=green&gt;[[Chess]]&lt;/font&gt;'''
etc. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 14:26, 24 June 2008 (UTC)

The classification of a subset of &quot;substantial books&quot; as &quot;featured books&quot; is largely a technical issue and could be done by some of our excellent admins who would check that the books met the Wikibook's guidelines. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 14:47, 24 June 2008 (UTC)

: I think quality is as important as substance, and both should be kept in mind when working on books. Books need a consistent style and presentation in order for readers to be able to easily use, navigate and read books. Book needs to be accurate in order for people to correctly learn a subject. Books don't need to have a substantial amount of content in order to teach and explain a subject, or to be good books. There have also been resources with a substantial amount of content, which were not considered books or within Wikibook's scope and were deleted as a result. Quality over quantity is an important concept here. Substance alone does not make a book.
: I don't think this is a wider problem. I think just making all other books easier to find is all that is needed, and that is work-in-progress. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:10, 24 June 2008 (UTC)
::Books that are accurate with enough content to be useful are &quot;substantial books&quot;.  I am glad that we agree that these books are important.
::I agree we should make books easier to find.  But readers do not want to find empty books. There are a lot of empty or nearly empty books in Wikibooks. All I am suggesting is that substantial books should be made easily accessible. In particular, as the criteria for &quot;featured books&quot; are tightened the previously featured books can remain listed as substantial books.[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 16:32, 24 June 2008 (UTC)
:::We only agree on some points. To me something that doesn't consider presentation and style is just enough for a lengthy encyclopedic article, and not enough to make a book. What readers want or don't want isn't something that can be realistically guessed. A small book may be good enough for some readers. I think it would be better to focus on ways to attract contributors to work on existing books, than to further make distinctions between books. By having enough contributors working on books, less books will than be empty. One way to help might be to add {{tlx|inactive}} or {{tlx|book stub}} to books, as a way of marking &quot;empty&quot; books that need help. Other than that I think you should keep in mind that books can become featured again once they improve enough to meet the community's expectations again. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:18, 24 June 2008 (UTC)
:Accuracy has never been something that we've really stressed here, but as the average quality of our &quot;good&quot; books continues to improve, we are going to need not only to check for accuracy but to actually demand it. &quot;Quality&quot;, something we should be striving for, does include factual accuracy.  Our current methods of writing books (typically 1 author, or a small handful of authors per book) doesn't lend itself well to the &quot;many eyes find many problems&quot; mantra that has powered Wikipedia. The idea of the Editorial Board, something that I championed for a while, fell flat because people viewed it as just another form of bureaucracy. However the concept of it, that we could have a formalized review process for books, is a good one I think. We need to be able to closely read the books we are calling &quot;good&quot;, and we need to be able to find strengths and weaknesses in their content and presentation. We could attract outside reviewers to read through our books, and make specific notes and suggestions about what needs to be improved. This would also be an excellent opportunity for outreach, because we would be able to attract people like college professors (who in turn could bring their classes here).
:Wikipedia uses two classifications: good articles and featured articles. The bar to becoming featured is obviously much higher, and the article must pass muster on both content and presentation. A second classification for books might be useful too, books which are &quot;good&quot; are not the same as books which are deserving of a place on the main page. Getting up to a higher level of recognition would require some kind of checking process, looking not just as the book's formatting, but also on the accuracy and completeness of the content. Some kind of a review stage could be the barrier between these two. Almost all printed books have independent editors and reviewers, and it would make good sense for us to adopt that mentality too, at least on some level. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:55, 24 June 2008 (UTC)
::Good points.  As you say, accuracy is of central importance for textbooks.

The division into &quot;featured&quot; for books with good content and good presentation and &quot;good&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot; for books that have acceptable content will give readers the necessary guidance when selecting a book.  I prefer &quot;substantial&quot; to &quot;good&quot; because it does not emphasise approval and stresses that the book is not empty or sparse.  Obviously a &quot;substantial&quot; book should have accurate content however, accurate content does not mean that the book has sufficient scope or an impartial emphasis and, as you point out, without a full [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]] review these issues cannot be exposed in a fair way.
:: The division into &quot;featured&quot;, &quot;substantial&quot; and &quot;other&quot; also answers the problem of removing a book that has substantial and accurate content from the &quot;featured&quot; list.  These books can be reclassified as &quot;substantial books&quot;.  Obviously if a book is full of inaccuracies it should be demoted to &quot;other&quot; until these are corrected. 
::This would actually be quite a small administrative change.  The books on the [[Main page]] could be selected from &quot;featured books&quot; and the [[Featured books]] page could be renamed &quot;substantial books&quot;.  Any substantial books that are &quot;featured&quot; would be highlighted in green or some other colour. This would also allow a smooth re-assessment of the current &quot;featured books&quot; - those that no longer make the grade for presentation could have the highlighting removed and be barred from the main page.

:::How are substantial books any different from featured books or from other books? Featured books are judged already by the requirements you suggest for substantial books. I don't see how substantial books would be any different from how featured books work already nor how substantial books would not involve some sort of judgment call. If I don't get it, how will readers? I think issues already are exposed without an editorial board existing. Issues are already exposed by the community, including readers sometimes, and I think it will become much easier to expose problems with FlaggedRevs. More people involved in the reviewing process the better it reflects the community stance on quality. An editorial board would limit reviewing to a chosen few which would only reflect there opinions. I think both suggestions would just cause unnecessary confusion and complexity. I don't see the benefits, how anything is improved or changed from either suggestion.
:::I think there are other ways to emphasize non-empty books, that could work better and would be easier to do. With the move to Subject pages and using DPL, Subject pages could also include a section of filtered list of books that are not in categories X, Y, Z.

::::The reason for having a separate set of &quot;substantial&quot; books is to offer our readers some books that can really be used as textbooks (ie they are not sparse/empty or dubious).  Wikibooks has a huge number of books that are not suitable for reading at their current stage of development and we need to save the reader from the disappointment of finding endless shells of books.
::::Substantial books would be selected by vote in a similar way to &quot;featured books&quot;.  They could be selected by the more lenient procedure that you suggest ie: &quot;not inactive stubs, do not have NPOV problems, and do not have accuracy disputes&quot;.  I prefer a vote because this encourages the community to take a look at the books.
::::The difference between substantial and featured books would be roughly what Whiteknight suggested.  Being &quot;featured&quot; would mean that the book is not only substantial but is an example of how to produce and format a book and has been subject to a more thorough review.

== [[US History]] - why it went wrong ==

I have just been going over [[US History]] and have discovered numerous stray additions such as biographies of Ghandi, an article on Picasso, a weird section on &quot;believe in hope&quot;, the origin of esperanto, spider webs in space and various other odd contributions.  These were not really vandalism.  They weren't even inaccurate, they were just bizarre.  The original complaint about US History also noted these strange accretions (about Zion etc.).  When I first came across this book about 2 years ago it did not have these odd contributions and was a &quot;good book&quot; if a bit sparse. This reinforces my feeling that books should have fixed editions once they have been voted for as &quot;substantial&quot; or &quot;featured&quot;. Books are too big to be inspected every day to ensure that the bizarre contributions have not been added. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 14:26, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

:That just brings up another interesting point for why substantial books make no sense. With FlaggedRevs we can flag the version that was voted in as featured and won't have to consider changes that happen after it, until a more updated version exists that should be featured instead. Even before a book becomes featured, good versions of a page will be shown to unregistered readers when flagged. FlaggedRevs may even one day make the featured books concept obsolete. I say hold off until FlaggedRevs has become available and has been used for 6 months. If there is still a need to emphasize certain books outside of fixed editions than this can always be brought back up later. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:00, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

:::From what I can see FlaggedRevs is effectively a fixed edition.  I would be in favour of it being applied to substantial books and hence also featured books - which would be the best substantial books.  The process would be first to vote for a substantial book on the basis of accuracy and content, books that passed this vote would get a FlaggedRevs fixed edition.  Substantial books that are examples of the best practice in Wikibooks can then be highlighted, either by vote or by a couple of admins. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 16:55, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

:::The reason that whole books should be available as fixed editions is that wikibooks are supposed to be used as textbooks.  It is no good having a textbook that advances in parts because academics and teachers refer to the books, not to individual modules. Are you sure that you are not suggesting a sort of Wikipedia-isation of Wikibooks where the module becomes the unit of interest rather than the book? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] ([[User talk:RobinH|talk]]) 08:11, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

::In addition to Ghandi, I remember there being a section in the WWII part about a spy, who I have never heard of before. It was recently removed. Woman with a limp or something like that. Maybe that is an interesting story, but it has nothing to do with American History. Other people like Martain Luther, who made large contributions to European Histroy, but none to American, are talked about in there. It's a good book but goes very off the subject.

== Galleries inside of templates ==

Is it possible to use a gallery inside a template?  I've been working on revamping [[Template:Animal sign]] (experimental version is at [[Template:Animal sign2]], but nothing I can think of makes a template argument show up as an image in a gallery.  It seems to just insert the argument name (within the three braces) instead of the argument value.  Help! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:16, 22 June 2008 (UTC)

:Yes its possible to use a gallery inside a template. I've fixed the problems for you. &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; like most custom tags take template arguments as literals. To deal with this common problem the parser function &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#tag:}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; was introduced to be used as a wrapper for tags to allow template parameters to be used. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:32, 22 June 2008 (UTC)
:: Thanks!  It it possible to sneak a couple of gallery options into the mix, such as perrow=&quot;2&quot;  and widths=&quot;300px&quot;? --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:42, 22 June 2008 (UTC)

::Just an expansion of the above point; the gallery tag lends itself to modification by inline styles, in addition to 'perrow', 'widths', and 'heights'.   An example of such style mods and the use of several galleries within a drop control template can be seen at [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Pictures/Images_in_Containers#The_Image_Gallery '''The Image Gallery'''].   The coloring of the 'picture mask' still defeats reason!   Regards, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 13:20, 29 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Extending Parrot ==

Parrot is not just an executable VM, it's a dynamically-linkable library that exports a Parrot API. The API allows add-ons to be developed to extend the functionality of Parrot.

There are two basic APIs or, more specifically, a single API that can be divided into two distinct categories: Those that have access to the internals of Parrot, and those that do not. In general, most extensions will not need deep internal access to Parrot's structures, and most should not rely on them. Parrot's internal structures are subject to change, and relying on a precise format of one for your extension could cause compatibility problems later on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History==

'''Lysergic Acid Diethylamide''' (LSD-25) is synthesized from lysergic acid, formed by ergot, a fungus that grows on rye. It was discovered by Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman in 1938, while he was working at Sandoz. He did not become aware of its effects until 1943, when he accidentally ingested some of the chemical.

During the 50s, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) conducted a secret program known as MKULTRA, which investigated the usage of LSD for mind control and interrogation. [http://www.erowid.org/psychoactives/war/mkultra/mkultra_article1.shtml]

LSD, during its brief history, has been used both spiritually and recreationally. Journalist Tom Wolfe, in his book ''The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'', recorded the adventures of Ken Kesey's hippie enclave, the Merry Pranksters, who often held extravagant parties based around LSD consumption, typically consumed in spiked Kool-Aid.
[[Image:Timothy-Leary-Los-Angeles-1989.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Dr. Timothy Leary, Ph.D.]]
Dr. Timothy Leary was an advocate of LSD use who believed that the chemical could be useful for psychology and spiritual pursuits. He created the catchphrase &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot; to encourage people to &quot;tune in&quot; to LSD, &quot;turn on&quot; to themselves and the world around them, and then &quot;drop out&quot; of the mainstream society, becoming self-reliant and enlightened.

Despite Leary's efforts to get LSD mainstream acceptance, the drug suffered from a lot of negative publicity. Many sensational urban legends sprung up around it. One was concerned with a young person who, while intoxicated on the drug, believed that they could fly, plummeting to their death out of a tall building. This tale appeared to come true in 1969, when Diane Linkletter, the daughter of famed TV show host Art Linkletter, committed suicide in this manner. Art claimed that she had been experimenting with LSD at the time, and went on a crusade against the drug. However, no evidence was uncovered to link her death to LSD usage.[http://www.snopes.com/horrors/drugs/linkletter.asp]

In 1966, Leary founded the League for Spiritual Discovery, a religious organization that had LSD as a sacrament. In 1970, Leary was convicted to a ten-year prison sentence for possession of cannabis, and the League shut down in his absence. In 2006, a [http://www.discovertheleague.org/ new League] started up, ten years after Leary's death.

==Legality==
After its short popularity during the 1960s, many nations, including the US, made LSD illegal. 

In the US, LSD is a Schedule I drug, meaning that the government has determined that it has &quot;a high potential for abuse and serve[s] no legitimate medical purpose.&quot; [http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs4/4260/index.htm#illegal] It is illegal to manufacture, buy, sell, trade, give away, or possess. [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_law.shtml]

==Usage==
LSD can cause effects such as mild hallucinations, sleeplessness, &quot;enhanced&quot; senses (brighter colors, richer sounds, etc.), increased heartrate, appetite loss, and synaesthesia. Synaesthesia is a phenomenon where senses overlap (for example, tasting colors, or seeing sounds). These effects, colloquially known as a &quot;trip&quot;, can last from 8-12 hours. 

[[Image:LSD_match.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Blotter paper tabs, a common method of distributing LSD (with a match head for size reference).]]
Adverse mental reactions (a &quot;bad trip&quot;) may result from negative emotions (or other environmental factors), or an unusually high dosage. These can be manifested as a sense of grim foreboding, anxiety, or even abject panic. To avoid a trip turning bad, it is suggested to create a change of environment (such as a different location, or listening to soothing music), or to remember that the mental effects are just being caused by the drug, and are only temporary.[http://www.thegooddrugsguide.com/info/bad_trips.htm]

The &quot;threshold&quot; (smallest dose with perceptible effects) is 20 micrograms. A &quot;common&quot; dose is between 50 and 150 micrograms. The lethal dosage is 12,000 micrograms, roughly 120 times a common dose.[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_dose.shtml] Hoffman, in his book ''LSD: My Problem Child'', notes: &quot;The danger of LSD lies not in its toxicity, but rather in the unpredictability of its psychic effects.&quot; [http://www.flashback.se/archive/my_problem_child/chapter2.html]

Because of this unpredictability, many users suggest having a &quot;trip sitter&quot; around during the trip, especially if it's the first time. Ideally, the sitter is a known and trusted friend, and knows how to deal with bad trips.

The DSM-IV lists Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) as a syndrome usually linked to LSD use. Victims of HPPD have altered perceptions, similar to those experienced during an LSD trip. Symptoms include seeing flashes of light, patterns in otherwise blank surfaces, and tracers from moving objects. Fortunately, this syndrome is rare.[http://www.drabraham.com/html/hppd.htm]

==Myths==
*LSD and Strychnine
*Chromosomal damage
====Death of Diane Linkletter====

Although flashbacks are real, they are uncommon. The myth that LSD builds up deposits in the body is not supported by evidence; the chemical is entirely water-soluble, and leaves the body entirely within hours of ingestion. [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_faq.shtml] It is now believed that flashbacks are caused by HPPD. (See Usage section, above.)

Hi Bodhi,

I'm afraid that I deleted your input into the Votes for Deletion discussion because it had already been closed. It was probably my fault that you thought it was still open since I forgot to remove the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{vfd}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag from the page. I apologise and hope you're not put off working on Wikibooks.

Finally, I would like to thank you for not just weighing in, but actually helping to improve the page in question.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have noted your contributions to the Muggles' Guide, and do appreciate the help; but I would caution you about checking sources. In particular, the films are &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; a source that we can use; this is about the books. And at the end of Chamber of Secrets, note that the action does occur in McGonagall's office, not Dumbledore's. I have checked the books, and in my edition (Bloomsbury Press, p.240) it quite clearly says &quot;McGonagall's office door&quot;.

Here's the HOW-TO on a very trick and clean CB antenna install in place of the stock one. (If I do say so myself.)

Goal: add CB antenna somewhere very low key, and also to NOT get in the way of the rear glass at all, or to catch too many trees.

Solution: Use good CB antenna in place of OEM AM/FM one, and add an AM/FM/CB splitter.

Parts list on bottom.

=== Installation Instructions ===

First, you must partially unbolt the front fender. Remove top three bolts, and loosen the two side bolts (10 mm). (Fig 1)

Box wrench required for this one bolt (10 mm). (Fig 2)

You need to get your hand, and later a ratchet, behind the fender from the top. (Fig 3)

Everything. (Fig 4)

Double female nut. (Fig 5 &amp; 6)

The converter from AM/FM radio to CB wire plug is a key component. (Fig 7)

Drill out slowly to 3/8&quot;. I drilled about 5 times sizing up as I went to avoid damaging the OEM part. (Fig 8 &amp; 9)

Next file down the top to create an even seat for the antenna double female nut to rest on. (Fig 10)

Trim the trim so the bolt head sticks out the bottom. (Fig 11)

Finished shot. (Fig 12 &amp; 13)

I already have better reception than my first try and that's before tuning SWR or the radio!

Now I just gotta get the SWR tuned!

=== Parts List ===

* Firestik: AR-1A, Match-Maker, CB/AM/FM, CB Antenna Splitter (retail $16)
* Wilson Silver 3' antenna.
* Double female antenna wire connector
* 3' Jumper CB wire ($9)
* Double female 3/8&quot; nut for bottom of antenna (free)
* CB wire to FM wire converter ($9)
* will add spring soon

=== Unsuccessful Swivel Mount ===

Finished product! This was the unsuccessful first installation.  The Firestik swivel mount broke off on the first mile of driving at 70+ mph! It bent down, I pulled over and, well, it broke in my hand. Better than on highway and losing a brand new Wilson Silver! I decided to take a different route this time and drilled out the stock bracket to accept a 3/8&quot; bolt and just mount the CB antenna right to that. I'm going to add a spring to help ease the stress - only problem is I JUST barely clear the garage now.  Check out updated pictures at bottom.

== Bird id template ==

Hi Snakesteuben,

I think you are probably right about the changes you have suggested to [[:Template:Bird id]].  The reason I had done it the way I did was so that I could transclude each bird page into multiple works without worrying about the header level.  In other words, I wanted to do something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
===Subsection===
{{:Field Guide/Great Tit}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
And not have to worry about how the &lt;nowiki&gt;==Description==&lt;/nowiki&gt; would mess up the parent work.  '''However''' - I later decided that the book I wanted to include these in should rather just refer the reader to the [[Field Guide]] instead. There is still a huge clean-up job that needs to be done as a result of the way I ''started'' - these pages were originally part of [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Birds]], so all the pages have that as a prefix.  They all need to be moved.  Maybe we could get one of the bots to do that.

There were a lot of things I wanted to do with the template that I didn't know how to do, and if I had to do it all over again, I'm sure I would have done it differently.  For example, instead of using the tables, I think I'd just use galleries. When I put the template together I didn't know galleries could do all the things they can do. I had thought that galleries were limited to 4 images per row, 180px wide, but that's not the case:
&lt;gallery perrow=2 widths=&quot;300px&quot;&gt;
image:Parus major 4 (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|&lt;center&gt;Adult&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Great Tit nestling.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Great Tit nestling&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Hmmm... maybe there's a way to make the pictures wider rather than just the picture containers wider.  CSS?

Another thing I would absolutely do is name each page according to the bird's binomial name.  And since binomial names are unique to each kingdom (afaik), it might be good to prefix each page name with the kingdom name, a la [[Field Guide/Animalia/Cyanocitta cristata]].

There are a LOT of other things that could be done with categories and DPL's (Dynamic Page Lists (? can't remember what the L stands for)) that would help in creating a key.  The [[v:Bloom Clock]] project is a good example of this.

I am really delighted that someone else has taken an interest in the field guides BTW.  I don't think anyone has touched them in about a year (maybe more), so as far as I'm concerned, you have a free hand to make changes.  There is a lot of room for improvement, so I urge you to experiment. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:15, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

: One other thing... maybe the best way to approach experimentation would be to copy the template into a different one - perhaps calling it &quot;Avian id&quot;, and making the changes there.  Once that's looking decent enough we could move it over the top of the bird id template, or just edit each page that uses the old one.  This approach would keep the existing stuff intact while we/you are in the middle of the major overhaul. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:19, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

:: I found that using galleries within templates is not as easy as I had hoped.  I made some changes to [[Template:Animal Sign|a similar template]] and got some help from [[User:Darklama]].  Unfortunately, it looks like it might not be possible to resize the images in a gallery made within a template.  It also looks like we're stuck with 4 images per row.  But even with those limitations, I think using the galleries in the bird id template would still be better as it eliminates the empty picture boxes.  I don't think the gallery can be placed inside a table though, but I think that's OK.  Let me know what you think. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:18, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

== Field Guide ==

Hi Snakesteuben,

I think we should add a field to the bird id template for synonyms, so that we can list alternate/deprecated binomial names.  Then we an create redirects.  

As it turns out, it's not as easy to add galleries to templates as I thought it would be.  [[User:Darklama]] helped me out a bit with that in the [[Template:Animal sign]] template.  So far it looks like we cannot resize the images and are stuck with four per row at the default (tiny) size.

__TOC__
The Great Tit, Parus major, is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common species throughout Europe and Asia in any sort of woodland. It is resident, and most Great Tits do not migrate.
== Appearance ==
Great Tits are easy to recognize, large in size at 14 cm, with a broad black line (broader in the male) down its otherwise yellow front. The neck and head are black with white cheeks and ear coverts. Upper parts are olive. It has a white wingbar and outer tail feathers. In young birds the black is replaced by brown, and the white by yellow.

Great Tits come in many races, but they fall into three groups. Great Tits in temperate Europe and Asia are essentially green above and yellow below. Great Tits in China, Korea, Japan and southeastern Russia are green above and white or yellow-tinged white below, and birds in India and south-east Asia are grey above and whitish below.
== Voice ==
Like other tits, the Great Tit a vocal bird, and has a large variety of calls, of which the most familiar is a &quot;teacher, teacher&quot;, also likened to a squeaky wheelbarrow wheel. In the 1st Movement of Bruckner's 4th Symphony several Great Tit songs are strung together in a very realistic manner. Interestingly, Great Tits from the two south Asian groups of races do not recognize the calls of the temperate Great Tits, and they may be a separate species.
== Habitat ==
== Nesting ==
Any hole will do for a nest, and it will readily take to nest boxes. The number in the clutch is often very large, but seven or eight white spotted red eggs are normal, with bigger clutches being laid by two or even more hens. The bird is a close sitter, hissing when disturbed.

The nestlings are unusual for altricial birds in having plumage coloured with carotenoids similarly to their parents. In most species it is dun-coloured to avoid predation. The nape is yellow and attracts the attention of the parents by its ultraviolet reflectance. This may be to make them easier to find in low light or a signal of fitness to win the parents' attention. This patch turns white after the first moult at an age of two months, and diminishes in size as the bird grows.

== Remarks ==
Great Tits are primarily insectivores. They prefer protein rich caterpillars during breeding season to feed their young. The bird is popular in the garden due to its acrobatic performances when feeding on nuts or seed. It will join winter tit flocks with other species.
== Vernacular names in other languages ==
* German: Kohlmeise ''f''
* French: Mésange charbonnière ''f''
* West Frisian: Blokmies ''f''
* Portuguese: Chapim-real ''m''

| description = The Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus or Parus caeruleus) is a small passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. The bird is easily recognisable by its blue and yellow plumage.

Blue tits, usually resident and non-migratory birds, are widespread and a common resident breeder throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and western Asia in deciduous or mixed woodlands with a high proportion of oak. They usually nest in tree holes, although they easily adapt to nest boxes where necessary. The main rival for nests and search for food is the much larger Great Tit.

The blue tit prefers insects and spiders for their diet. Outside the breeding season, they also eat seeds and other vegetable-based foods. Blue tits are famed for their skill, as they can cling to the outermost branches and hang upside down when looking for food.

The Blue Tit is classified as a Least Concern species on the IUCN Red List (version 3.1), and as a Green Status species, since 1996, by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the United Kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rationale ==
I propose creating thumbnail pages for each of the top categories in each field guide. Field guides are for bird identification. These online guides will each have hundreds of links on the contents page. If the user knew which of those myriad links to click to see the right picture, (s)he wouldn't need a field guide! Trial and error, drilling up and down and up and down the tree? Myself, I would find that frustrating and spectacularly unhelpful. Using the thumbnail guide, the user can quickly narrow the choices down and zoom in for more info on the likelier candidates. Just like using a paper field guide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of places where you can find good information about Linux networking.

There are a wealth of Consultants available. A listing can be found at LinuxPorts Consultants Database

Alan Cox, the current maintainer of the Linux kernel networking code maintains a world wide web page that contains highlights of current and new developments in linux Networking at: www.uk.linux.org.

Another good place is a book written by Olaf Kirch entitled the Network Administrators Guide. It is a work of the Linux Documentation Project and you can read it interactively at Network Administrators Guide HTML version or you can obtain it in various formats by ftp from the metalab.unc.edu LDP ftp archive. Olaf's book is quite comprehensive and provides a good high level overview of network configuration under linux.

There is a newsgroup in the Linux news hierarchy dedicated to networking and related matters, it is:

''comp.os.linux.networking''

There is a mailing list to which you can subscribe where you may ask questions relating to Linux networking. To subscribe you should send a mail message:

   To: majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu
   Subject: anything at all
   Message:
   subscribe linux-net

On the various IRC networks there are often #linux channels on which people will be able to answer questions on linux networking.


Please remember when reporting any problem to include as much relevant detail about the problem as you can. Specifically you should specify the versions of software that you are using, especially the kernel version, the version of tools such as pppd or dip and the exact nature of the problem you are experiencing. This means taking note of the exact syntax of any error messages you receive and of any commands that you are issuing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Developing a brand new kernel implementation of the tcp/ip protocol stack that would perform as well as existing implementations was not an easy task. The decision not to port one of the existing implementations was made at a time when there was some uncertainty as to whether the existing implementations may become encumbered by restrictive copyrights because of the court case put by U.S.L. and when there was a lot of fresh enthusiasm for doing it differently and perhaps even better than had already been done.

The original volunteer to lead development of the kernel network code was Ross Biro biro@yggdrasil.com. Ross produced a simple and incomplete but mostly usable implementation set of routines that were complemented by an ethernet driver for the WD-8003 network interface card.This was enough to get many people testing and experimenting with the software and some people even managed to connect machines in this configuration to live internet connections. The pressure within the Linux community driving development for networking support was building and eventually the cost of a combination of some unfair pressure applied to Ross and his own personal commitments outweighed the benefit he was deriving and he stepped down as lead developer.

Ross's efforts in getting the project started and accepting the responsibility for actually producing something useful in such controversial circumstances were what catalyzed all future work and were therefore an essential component of the success of the current product.

Orest Zborowski obz@Kodak.COM produced the original BSD socket programming interface for the Linux kernel. This was a big step forward as it allowed many of the existing network applications to be ported to linux without serious modification.

Somewhere about this time Laurence Culhane loz@holmes.demon.co.uk developed the first drivers for Linux to support the SLIP protocol.These enabled many people who did not have access to Ethernet networking to experiment with the new networking software. Again, some people took this driver and pressed it into service to connect them to the Internet. This gave many more people a taste of the possibilities that could be realized if Linux had full networking support and grew the number of users actively using and experimenting with the networking software that existed.

One of the people that had also been actively working on the task of building networking support was Fred van Kempen waltje@uwalt.nl.mugnet.org. After a period of some uncertainty following Ross's resignation from the lead developer position Fred offered his time and effort and accepted the role essentially unopposed. Fred had some ambitious plans for the direction that he wanted to take the Linux networking software and he set about progressing in those directions. Fred produced a series of networking code called the NET-2' kernel code (theNET' code being Ross's)which many people were able to use pretty much usefully. Fred formally put a number of innovations on the development agenda, such as the dynamic device interface, Amateur Radio AX.25 protocol support and a more modularly designed networking implementation. Fred's NET-2 code was used by a fairly large number of enthusiasts, the number increasing all the time as word spread that the software was working. The networking software at this time was still a large number of patches to the standard release of kernel code and was not included in the normal release. The NET-FAQ and subsequent NET-2-HOWTO's described the then fairly complex procedure to get it all working. Fred's focus was on developing innovations to the standard network implementations and this was taking time. The community of users was growing impatient for something that worked reliably and satisfied the 80% of users and, as with Ross, the pressure on Fred as lead developer rose.

Alan Cox iialan@www.uk.linux.org proposed a solution to the problem designed to resolve the situation. He proposed that he would take Fred's NET-2 code and debug it, making it reliable and stable so that it would satisfy the impatient user base while relieving that pressure from Fred allowing him to continue his work. Alan set about doing this, with some good success and his first version of Linux networking code was called Net-2D(ebugged)The code worked reliably in many typical configurations and the user base was happy. Alan clearly had ideas and skills of his own to contribute to the project and many discussions relating to the direction the NET-2 code was heading ensued. There developed two distinct schools within the Linux networking community, one that had the philosophy of make it work first, then make it better and the other of `make it better first'.Linus ultimately arbitrated and offered his support to Alan's development efforts and included Alan's code in the standard kernel source distribution. This placed Fred in a difficult position. Any continued development would lack the large user base actively using and testing the code and this would mean progress would be slow and difficult. Fred continued to work for a short time and eventually stood down and Alan came to be the new leader of the Linux networking kernel development effort.

Donald Becker becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov soon revealed his talents in the low level aspects of networking and produced a huge range of ethernet drivers, nearly all of those included in the current kernels were developed by Donald. There have been other people that have made significant contributions, but Donald's work is prolific and so warrants special mention.

Alan continued refining the NET-2-Debugged code for some time while working on progressing some of the matters that remained unaddressed on the `TODO' list. By the time the Linux 1.3.* kernel source had grown its teeth the kernel networking code had migrated to the NET-3 release on which current versions are based. Alan worked on many different aspects of the networking code and with the assistance of a range of other talented people from the Linux networking community grew the code in all sorts of directions. Alan produced dynamic network devices and the first standard AX.25 and IPX implementations. Alan has continued tinkering with the code, slowly restructuring and enhancing it to the state it is in today.

PPP support was added by Michael Callahan callahan@maths.ox.ac.uk and Al Longyear longyear@netcom.com this too was critical to increasing the number of people actively using linux for networking.

Jonathon Naylor jsn@cs.nott.ac.uk has contributed by significantly enhancing Alan's AX.25 code, adding NetRom and Rose protocol support. The AX.25/NetRom/Rose support itself is quite significant, because no other operating system can boast standard native support for these protocols beside Linux.

There have of course been hundreds of other people who have made significant contributions to the development of the Linux networking software. Some of these you will encounter later in the technology specific sections, other people have contributed modules, drivers, bug-fixes, suggestions, test reports and moral support. In all cases each can claim to have played a part and offered what they could. The Linux kernel networking code is an excellent example of the results that can be obtained from the Linux style of anarchic development, if it hasn't yet surprised you, it is bound to soon enough, the development hasn't stopped.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are after some basic tutorial information on tcp/ip networking generally, then I recommend you take a look at the following documents:

tcp/ip introduction

this document comes as both a text version and a postscript version.

tcp/ip administration

this document comes as both a text version and a postscript version.

If you are after some more detailed information on tcp/ip networking then I highly recommend:

Internetworking with TCP/IP, Volume 1: principles, protocols and architecture, by Douglas E. Comer, ISBN 0-13-227836-7, Prentice Hall publications, Third Edition, 1995.

If you are wanting to learn about how to write network applications in a Unix compatible environment then I also highly recommend:

Unix Network Programming, by W. Richard Stevens, ISBN 0-13-949876-1, Prentice Hall publications, 1990.

A second edition of this book is appearing on the bookshelves; the new book is made up of three volumes: check Prenice-Hall's web site to probe further.

You might also try the comp.protocols.tcp-ip newsgroup.

An important source of specific technical information relating to the Internet and the tcp/ip suite of protocols are RFC's. RFC is an acronym for `Request For Comment' and is the standard means of submitting and documenting Internet protocol standards. There are many RFC repositories. Many of these sites are ftp sites and other provide World Wide Web access with an associated search engine that allows you to search the RFC database for particular keywords.

One possible source for RFC's is at Nexor RFC database.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to Nicholas Stern, global climate change is the defining issue of our time requiring immediate and decisive action (Stern, 2006).  A much required global transformation will emerge from: individual actions, sustainable business strategies, government regulations, and non governmental organization initiatives (Muller &amp; Siebenhuner, 2007).  This paper will argue that the only way that businesses can manage their climate change risk is through the comprehensive implementation of sustainable development strategies.  These strategies require a paradigm shift toward more systems, future and critical thinking skills, by everyone in the company.  This will require the re-education of the workforce from the current, largely one dimensional focus on economic value; to a multi-dimensional, interdependent, values-based, focus on environmental, social and economic issues.  This transformation will be complex and will evolve over the lifetime of a learner.  Businesses will find that education for sustainable development through learner-centred e-learning, within a blended learning program, will be the most efficient and effective means of achieving long-term business survival and prosperity.


'''&lt;big&gt;Opportunities and Risks&lt;/big&gt;'''


For business, the response to global climate change and adoption of sustainable development will be driven by opportunities and risks.  Business opportunities include: new markets, increasing brand equity through corporate social responsibility programs, attraction and retention of labour, and brand differentiation through leadership values (Lovins , Lovins, &amp; Hawken, 1999).  For instance, companies like Unilever have adopted sustainable development for their world-wide Corporate Social Responsibility program in order to enhance and protect brand equity (Unilever, 2008).  Business will also be driven to manage climate change risk: physical risk, regulatory risk, litigation risk and reputation risk (Van Bergen, Soonawala, &amp; Wisse Smit, 2008).  


Mainstream economic theory would have us believe that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet (Daly &amp; Farley, 2004).   The menacing implications of climate change such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide; and the depletion of water, natural resources, and soils, speak to the unsustainable nature of our current economic paradigm.  It has been proposed that the concept of sustainable development and its balance among economic, environmental and social priorities is the basis for shifting to more sustainable practices.  Organizational learning is an essential enabler to achieving sustainability (Siebenhuner &amp; Arnold, 2007).  


'''&lt;big&gt;Sustainability Defined&lt;/big&gt;'''


Sustainability, a term often used interchangeably with the term sustainable development, has been commonly defined as “…development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” (WCED, 1987).  The Brundtland Report (WCED, 1987) identified two key concepts within this term: 1) the concept of  'needs', in particular the essential needs of the world's poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and 2) the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs (WCED, 1987).  Although the concept of sustainable development has been around since 1970, the Brundtland report legitimized it as a template for global decision-making.  The idea that there should be a balance between economic, social and environmental priorities in the decision making process was born.  


Since the notion of sustainable development is centered in the use of new “thinking processes” to realize new values and attitudes; learning and reinforcement of learning must occur continuously and should be part of a lifelong learning process.  


'''&lt;big&gt;Lifelong Learning&lt;/big&gt;'''


The re-education of the workforce for the implementation of sustainable development, and its required shift in thinking must be systemic and evolve over the lifetime of a learner.   The concept of lifelong learning within business returns as an important element in the sustainable development solution. 


Lifelong learning first emerged in the early 1970s, and was briefly popular among intergovernmental think-tanks such as UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD)(Field, 2000). It re-emerged in 1994 in the European Commission, in a White Paper on competitiveness and economic growth.  When the Commission declared 1996 to be the European Year of Lifelong Learning, the idea spread throughout Europe (Field, 2000).  Lifelong learning is a concept that recognizes the accelerated rate of change in industrial society and the advances in technology, information systems and global markets (Merriam &amp; Callarella, 1999).   Lifelong learning signals a shift from a solitary focus on formal schooling to a broader focus that also embraces ongoing learning by adults.  

 
E-learning, inconjunction with face-to-face learning, holds the promise of accessibility and a framework for a sustained engagement in a lifelong learning process.  



'''&lt;big&gt;Education for Sustainable Development&lt;/big&gt;'''


As noted earlier, a shift to sustainability is a change in paradigm for business, which has traditionally viewed economics as a dominant notion within society.  Springett suggests that education on sustainability challenges the “rationality” of the capitalist economic paradigm of production and consumption (Springett, 2005; Siebenhuner &amp; Arnold, 2007).  Many advocates for sustainability question whether incremental changes in business strategy can go far enough, suggesting that transformational change is required (Tilbury, 2002).  Numerous researchers also suggest that a transition to sustainable development must introduce changes in personal values and institutional structures to achieve an environmental, social and economic balance (Gladwin et al, 1995; O’Connor, 1998; Huckle, 1996 as cited in Springett, 2005).


While studying organizational learning for the management of sustainable development, Siebenhuner &amp; Arnold (2007) defined sustainability-oriented learning as a process:

{{TextBox|“… where organizations display behavioural changes that are attributable to a change in the knowledge and value bases as a result of reflexive processes, and where the concept of sustainability served as a fundamental framework” (Siebenhuner &amp; Arnold, 2007, p.341).}}


Numerous researchers have identified that education for sustainable development requires the building of skills in systems thinking, critical thinking, futures thinking, visioning, problem solving and participatory decision-making (Springett &amp; Kearins, 2005; Springett, 2005; Carew &amp; Mitchell, 2008; Wheeler, Zohar &amp; Hart, 2005; Vann, Pacheco &amp;  Motloch, 2006; Galea, 2004 as cited in Tillbury, 2002).  In addition, researchers have identified that specific professional groups such as professional managers, engineers and accountants require reorientation to incorporate sustainability into their professional standard bodies of knowledge (Bebbington, 1997; Carew &amp; Mitchell, 2006; Baas et al, 2000).  


Pedagogical approaches for sustainability must be experiential, inter-disciplinary, based on action-learning and provide “just in time”, real world learning and application opportunities (Wheeler, Zohar, &amp;  Hart, 2005; Siebenhuner and Arnold, 2007; Dieleman and Huisingh, 2005; Bebbington, 1997; Springett, 2005).  Instructional techniques such as the inquiry method lend themselves to the reflective nature of sustainability concepts, where learners “increase their competency as learners” and focus on the learning process rather than a final predetermined answer (Postman &amp; Weingartner, 1969).  


E-learning and blended learning can be designed to meet many of these requirements.  For instance, games and simulations have been used as experiential learning tools for sustainability (Dieleman &amp; Huisingh, 2006).  Given the wide variety of learners in business (front line employees to professionals), it is necessary to use a number of educational techniques to establish and provide long term reinforcement of sustainability attitudes, knowledge and skills.  E –learning or computer based training can play a role in this evolving activity.


'''&lt;big&gt;E-Learning – A Component in Blended Learning&lt;/big&gt;'''


Sustainability-focused workplace learning will redefine e-learning and its contribution to blended learning.  E-learning has been defined many ways including: “the use of computer network technology, primarily over or through the internet, to deliver information and instruction to individuals” (Welsh et al., 2003 as cited in Servage, 2005), “instructional content or learning experiences delivered or enabled by electronic technology” (Commission on Technology and Adult Learning, 2001 as cited in Servage, 2005), and “…us(ing) information and communication technologies (ICTs) to deliver content (learning, knowledge and skills) on a one-way [asynchronous] basis” (Conference Board of Canada, 2001 as cited in Servage, 2005).   

Blended learning incorporates e-learning with various methods of face to face learning.  Blended learning at an organizational level can be defined as:


{{TextBox|“…a purposeful mix of delivery media (particularly face-to-face and various forms of technologies) to improve learning/performance solutions which are derived from the goals and needs of an organization.” (Yoon &amp; Lim, 2007, p.481)}}  


Face to face learning may range from formal instructor-led training to informal peer discussions.  The blend of face to face activities and e-learning provide the best of both worlds and have been proven to be more effective than either method on its own.


In the past, e-learning’s ability to deliver on its promises of customized, “just-in- time”, impactful learning have fallen short (Servage, 2005).  However, e-learning could be effectively used to provide “just in time” reinforcement and coaching on the application of sustainable development concepts.  B&amp;Q Stores, the largest home improvement retailer in the UK, used e-learning to create awareness and reinforce the award-winning work they were doing on sustainability and diversity.  The company reached over 9,500 staff in over 320 stores by using scenarios and case studies from actual B&amp;Q employees featured in interactive e-learning modules.  The e-learning modules were supported by face to face staff meetings and discussions among colleagues (Epic Company, 2007; B&amp;Q Stores, 2004).   


In other situations e-learning can support sustainable development implementation by providing decision making templates for purchasing, tools for policy development, and systems for communicating new policies and procedures.   The Sustainable Development Department in the United Kingdom provides procurement personnel and policy analysts with on-line decision support forms and tools for sustainable development (Sustainable Development UK, 2008). 

  
Sustainability is about people and their way of knowing and acting in the world.  Learning new sustainable ways of knowing and being will depend on learners’ self-awareness, strengths, weaknesses and locus of control, in addition to language, cultural and socio-economic factors (Servage, 2005).  Furthermore, the interdependency of learning and social context for sustainability is critical.  It is for this reason that e-learning, with its ability to use an array of technologies, learning objects, languages and learning theories can help bridge the language, culture and employment divide.  Unlike face to face instructor-led training, e-learning has the ability to provide a choice to a learner about when, how and what they need to learn, thus supporting the principle of androgogy and self directed learning.  Some of the technologies that can be used include: group or individual webcasts, discussion boards, podcasts, simulations and games, blogging, learning objects and e-portfolios (Mason, 2006). Blended with face to face learning, e-learning can be imbedded into organizational learning and operational strategies to create life long learning in sustainability.  


'''&lt;big&gt;Learner Centred E-Learning within a Blended Learning Program&lt;/big&gt;'''


Learner centred education is central to the success of education for sustainable development due to its dependence on aligned values, attitudes and behaviours.  Particularly, the depth and breath of learning theories are critical to the design and implementation of instructional strategies. Critical learning theories include andragogy, self-directed learning, critical reflection, cognitive, and social learning (Waight &amp; Stewart, 2005).  These theories, when properly employed will contribute directly to the success of the implementation of sustainable development strategies.


Knowles identifies andragogy as the art and science of helping adults learn (Knowles, 1980 as cited in Waight &amp; Stewart, 2005). He suggests that adult learners are autonomous, self-directed, motivated, goal oriented, practical and have rich experiences.  In order to value adult learners within a framework of sustainable development, e-learning should incorporate these concepts in meaningful ways.  As in the case of B &amp; Q Stores, the Sustainability and Diversity program used the rich experiences of employees and allowed the self directed use of the materials.  Word of mouth spread the news that the program was interesting which resulted in its successful uptake (Epic, 2007).


Brookfield identified critical reflection theory as a process that engages the learner in reflection of self-images, norms, assumptions, and behaviours (Brookfield, 1986 as cited in Waight &amp; Stewart, 2005).  As noted earlier by Siebenhuner &amp; Arnold (2007), implementation of sustainable development is a change management process that requires behavioural changes that take place when an individual reflects upon their values and newly acquired knowledge.  For instance, a procurement manager many need to learn about, and reflect upon, the environmental, social and economic impacts of unsustainable forestry practices before realizing that only products certified from sustainable forests should be procured.  For this reason, e-learning and blended learning for sustainability need to incorporate critical reflection that challenges the cultural assumptions that make Western society so unsustainable.


Cognitive learning theory refers to a change in thinking patterns over time.  Both dialectical thinking and contextual thought processes affect how learners view knowledge.  In dialectical thinking (Riegel, 1973; Kramer, 1983 &amp; 1989; and Kegan, 1994 as cited in Waight &amp; Stewart, 2005) we understand that our thoughts are affected by our personal histories and culture. As our lives change, so does our interpretation of knowledge and its importance, therefore our understanding of knowledge is constantly changing.  Contextually, we know that social, political and economic forces also shape how we value and view information (Merriam and Caffarella, 1999).   These theories are significant when considering how to communicate sustainability to a multi-cultural workforce or to different cultures around the world at branch plants.  There is no “one size fits all” e-learning or face to face learning solution.  The sustainable development program will need to be situated and sensitive to the cultural, social, political and economic factors faced by the learners in their current context.  An understanding of cognitive theory allows e-learning designers to see how their programs might influence knowledge interpretation and short-term and long-term memory storage (Waight &amp;  Stewart, 2005).


Social learning emphasizes that learning occurs by observing role models (Bandura, 1977,1986 as cited in Waight and Stewart, 2005).  Social learning theory also identifies how behaviours are repeated if they are reinforced and rewarded.  Self-efficacy, which relates to a person's judgment about whether they can successfully learn knowledge and skills, is also an important element to social learning.  Therefore, learning for sustainable development requires: 1) interaction with model business leaders, managers, and peers, 2) building confidence in learner’s abilities pertaining to the application of sustainable development, and 3) developing learning activities that reinforce and reward the learner.   Although social learning plays heavily upon the role of face to face training, peer discussions, coaching, mentoring and meetings; e-learning can be used to build confidence and reinforce learners through interactive e-learning programs.  As a business builds a new balance of norms and values within a company, e-learning can often be the quiet partner that helps employees navigate this new territory.


'''&lt;big&gt;Conclusion&lt;/big&gt;'''


Rising energy prices, resource depletion, water shortages and climate disruption will change the way that businesses fundamentally operate.  The only way to manage these risks is through the comprehensive implementation of sustainable development strategies.  These strategies require a paradigm shift toward more systems, future and critical thinking skills, by everyone in the company.   The re-education of the workforce and its subsequent transformation will be complex and evolve over the lifetime of the business and its employees.  Businesses will find that education for sustainable development through learner-centred e-learning, within a blended learning program, will be the most efficient and effective means of achieving long-term business survival and prosperity.

      <comment>/* IP Addresses, an Explanation */ Should add some information about IPv6 addresses too.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you start building or configuring your network you will need some things. The most important of these are:

= Current Kernel source(Optional) =
Please note:

The majority of current distributions come with networking enabled,therefore it may not be required to recompile the kernel. If you are running well known hardware you should be just fine. For example: 3COM NIC, NE2000 NIC, or a Intel NIC. However if you find yourself in the position that you do need to update the kernel, the following information is provided.

Because the kernel you are running now might not yet have support for the network types or cards that you wish to use you will probably need the kernel source so that you can recompile the kernel with the appropriate options.

For users of the major distributions such as Redhat, Caldera, Debian, or Suse this no longer holds true. As long as you stay within the mainstream of hardware there should be no need to recompile your
kernel unless there is a very specific feature that you need.

You can always obtain the latest kernel source from ftp.cdrom.com. This is not the official site but they have LOTS of bandwidth and ALOT of users allowed. The official site is kernel.org but please use the above if you can. Please remember that ftp.kernel.org is seriously overloaded. Use a mirror.

Normally the kernel source will be untarred into the /usr/src/linux directory. For information on how to apply patches and build the kernel you should read the Kernel-HOWTO.  For information on how to
configure kernel modules you should read the Modules mini-HOWTO. Also, the README file found in the kernel sources and the Documentation directory are very informative for the brave reader.

Unless specifically stated otherwise, I recommend you stick with the standard kernel release (the one with the even number as the second digit in the version number). Development release kernels (the ones with the odd second digit) may have structural or other changes that may cause problems working with the other software on your system. If you are uncertain that you could resolve those sorts of problems in addition to the potential for there being other software errors, then don't use them.

On the other hand, some of the features described here have been introduced during the development of 2.1 kernels, so you must take your choice: you can stick to 2.0 while wait for 2.2 and an updated
distribution with every new tool, or you can get 2.1 and look around for the various support programs needed to exploit the new features.As I write this paragraph, in August 1998, 2.1.115 is current and 2.2 is expected to appear pretty soon.

= Current Network tools. = 

The network tools are the programs that you use to configure linux network devices. These tools allow you to assign addresses to devices and configure routes for example.  
Most modern linux distributions are supplied with the network tools, so if you have installed from a distribution and haven't yet installed the network tools then you should do so.

If you haven't installed from a distribution then you will need to source and compile the tools yourself. This isn't difficult.

The network tools are now maintained by Bernd Eckenfels and are available at: ftp.inka.de and are mirrored at: ftp.uk.linux.org.You can also get the latest RedHat packages from net-tools-1.51-3.i386.rpm

Be sure to choose the version that is most appropriate for the kernel you wish to use and follow the instructions in the package to install.

To install and configure the version current at the time of the writing you need do the following:

               user% tar xvfz net-tools-1.33.tar.gz
               user% cd net-tools-1.33
               user% make config
               user% make
               root# make install

Or to use the Redhat packages:
               root# rpm -U net-tools-1.51-3.i386.rpm

Additionally, if you intend configuring a firewall or using the IP masquerade feature you will require the ipfwadm command. The latest version of it may be obtained from: ftp.xos.nl. Again there are a number of versions available. Be sure to pick the version that most closely matches your kernel. Note that the firewalling features of Linux changed during 2.1 development and has been superceded by ipchains in v2.2 of the kernel. ipfwadm only applies to version 2.0 of the kernel. The following are known to be distributions with version 2.0 or below of the kernel.

               Redhat 5.2 or below
               Caldera pre version 2.2
               Slackware pre version 4.x
               Debian pre version 2.x

To install and configure the version current at the time of this writing you need to read the IPChains howto located at The Linux Documentation Project

Note that if you run version 2.2 (or late 2.1) of the kernel, ipfwadm is not the right tool to configure firewalling. This version of the NET-3-HOWTO currently doesn't deal with the new firewalling setup. If you need more detailed information on ipchains please refer to the above.

= Network Applications Programs = 
The network application programs are programs such as telnet and ftp and their respective server programs. David Holland has been managing a distribution of the most common of these, which is now maintained by netbug@ftp.uk.linux.org.  You may obtain the distribution from: ftp.uk.linux.org.

= IPv4 Addresses, an Explanation = 

Internet Protocol Addresses are composed of four bytes. The convention is to write addresses in what is called `dotted decimal notation'. In this form each byte is converted to a decimal number (0-255) dropping any leading zero's unless the number is zero and written with each byte separated by a `.' character. By convention each interface of a host or router has an IP address. It is legal for the same IP address to be used on each interface of a single machine in some circumstances but usually each interface will have its own address.

Internet Protocol Networks are contiguous sequences of IP addresses.  All addresses within a network have a number of digits within the address in common. The portion of the address that is common amongst all addresses within the network is called the `network portion' of the address. The remaining digits are called the `host portion'. The number of bits that are shared by all addresses within a network is called the netmask and it is role of the netmask to determine which addresses belong to the network it is applied to and which don't. For example, consider the following:



             -----------------  ---------------
             Host Address       192.168.110.23
             Network Mask       255.255.255.0
             Network Portion    192.168.110.
             Host portion                  .23
             -----------------  ---------------
             Network Address    192.168.110.0
             Broadcast Address  192.168.110.255
             -----------------  ---------------



Any address that is 'bitwise anded' with its netmask will reveal the address of the network it belongs to. The network address is therefore always the lowest numbered address within the range of addresses on the network and always has the host portion of the address coded all zeroes.

The broadcast address is a special address that every host on the network listens to in addition to its own unique address. This address is the one that datagrams are sent to if every host on the network is meant to receive it. Certain types of data like routing information and warning messages are transmitted to the broadcast address so that every host on the network can receive it simultaneously. There are two commonly used standards for what the broadcast address should be. The most widely accepted one is to use the highest possible address on the network as the broadcast address.  In the example above this would be 192.168.110.255. For some reason other sites have adopted the convention of using the network address as the broadcast address. In practice it doesn't matter very much which you use but you must make sure that every host on the network is configured with the same broadcast address. 
 
For administrative reasons some time early in the development of the IP protocol some arbitrary groups of addresses were formed into networks and these networks were grouped into what are called classes.  These classes provide a number of standard size networks that could be allocated. The ranges allocated are: 


        ----------------------------------------------------------
        | Network | Netmask       | Network Addresses            |
        | Class   |               |                              |
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        |    A    | 255.0.0.0     | 0.0.0.0    - 127.255.255.255 |
        |    B    | 255.255.0.0   | 128.0.0.0  - 191.255.255.255 |
        |    C    | 255.255.255.0 | 192.0.0.0  - 223.255.255.255 |
        |Multicast| 240.0.0.0     | 224.0.0.0  - 239.255.255.255 |
        ----------------------------------------------------------



What addresses you should use depends on exactly what it is that you are doing. You may have to use a combination of the following activities to get all the addresses you need:



Installing a linux machine on an existing IP network

      If you wish to install a linux machine onto an existing IP
      network then you should contact whoever administers the network
      and ask them for the following information:


   ·  Host IP Address

   ·  IP network address

   ·  IP broadcast address

   ·  IP netmask

   ·  Router address

   ·  Domain Name Server Address


      You should then configure your linux network device with those
      details.  You can not make them up and expect your configuration
      to work.


Building a brand new network that will never connect to the Internet&quot; If you are building a private network and you never intend that network to be connected to the Internet then you can choose whatever addresses you like.  However, for safety and consistency reasons there have been some IP network addresses that have been reserved specifically for this purpose. These are specified in RFC1597 and are as follows:



           -----------------------------------------------------------
           |         RESERVED PRIVATE NETWORK ALLOCATIONS            |
           -----------------------------------------------------------
           | Network | Netmask       | Network Addresses             |
           | Class   |               |                               |
           -----------------------------------------------------------
           |    A    | 255.0.0.0     | 10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255  |
           |    B    | 255.255.0.0   | 172.16.0.0  - 172.31.255.255  |
           |    C    | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 |
           -----------------------------------------------------------



You should first decide how large you want your network to be and then choose as many of the addresses as you require.

= Cunningham-Euwe Variation=
While White's 3.Nf3 prevented the check on h4, Black's third move renews the threat. Here White is almost powerless to stop h4, as 4.g3?! fxg3 5.hxg3 Nf6 saddles White with a weak pawn on g3, and the semi-open h-file cannot be effectively used. He has two main continuations: 4.Bc4 and 4.Nc3. 4.Bc4 is the main line, clearing f1 for the White king to move to. 4.Nc3, however, is also good, with simple development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 4.7L PowerTech V8 Engine Swap ==

Note: All of this info applies to 2.4L and 3.7L gas Libertys. I just can't see someone with a CRD wanting to replace their engine. The CRD has completely different engine mount brackets but does already have the correct transmission (at least in my case - MY 2005). The 2006 CRD uses a PCI TCM rather than the 2006 gas's CAN TCM, which could make swapping in a 2006 Dodge Ram CAN TCM more difficult. The CRD BCM is different from the Gas BCM and will probably expect the TCM to be on the PCI bus. In order to use the CAN TCM in the 2006 CRD you'd probably also need to swap out the CRD BCM for a gas BCM.

=== Emissions ===

In order to be smog legal you'll need to use an engine that is the same model year as your vehicle or newer. You'll also need to be sure you install all of the factory emissions equipment that would normally go with that engine.

=== PCM ===

In order for the engine to be compatible with your factory emissions equipment you'll need to make sure you get the same type of PCM (Powertrain Control Module) as you originally had. There are two types of PCMs: JTEC and NGC. JTEC is the older controller and NGC is the newer controller. There's an easy way to tell the two apart: an NGC PCM has four connectors on it because it integrates the TMC (Transmission Control Module), while the JTEC has three connectors on it because it uses a separate TCM. If you have Sentry Key you'll need to have your VIN number programmed into the new PCM in order to start the Jeep. Simply reprogramming the VIN will create an unerasable DTC, the only way to prevent this DTC is to have the PCM properly reprogrammed using a DRB III so its secret key matches the secret key in your SKIM (Sentry Key Immobilizer Module). You'll want to grab the original PCM and wiring harness when you pick up the engine or you'll be stuck trying to match one later on.

Note: The 2006 Libertys uses a hybrid bus system where the PCM (engine), gas TCM (transmission), and ABM (ABS and ESP) all use the CAN Bus and everything else uses the PCI Bus. The BCM (Body Control Module) acts as a bridge between the PCI Bus and CAN Bus. The 2006 Dodge Ram PCM and TCM also uses CAN, so you might be in luck here.

=== Engine ===

Not that I've done any actual measurements (I can't find any online) but the 4.7L PowerTech V8 is probably the only easily swappable engine that will fit. This engine can be found in the Dodge Dakota, Dodge Durango, Dodge Ram, Jeep Commander and Jeep Grand Cherokee. In my model year, 2005, all of these vehicles except the Dodge RAM utilize the CAN Bus rather than the Liberty's PCI Bus. This means that for the PCM to be electrically compatible with the rest of the Control Modules in my Jeep I have to use an engine out of a Dodge Ram.

=== Transmission ===

All vehicles with the NGC PCM have an integrated TCM, which means that unless you find a way to reprogram it, you're pretty much stuck with the transmission that originally came with the engine. The 2005 Dodge Ram, the only vehicle with an engine compatible with my Liberty, has two transmission options: the 45RFE/545RFE and 48RE. As far as I know, the 48RE is only paired with the Cummins diesels. This leaves the 45RFE/545RFE as the only option. Luckily, the 545RFE should mount perfectly in the Liberty, as it is the same transmission that the Liberty CRD uses.

=== Cooling ===

With the Liberty's relatively small grill and the larger engine, you'll need a more efficient radiator to dissipate all of the heat.
* comment*
With the efficiency of modern cooling systems, the likelihood of upgrading the cooling system being required is fairly slim.

=== Motor Mounts ===

In theory width and height wise the 3.7L should be the same size as the 4.7L. Looking at the service manuals the mounting points on the sides of the two engines look identical. If the 3.7L motor mounts can support the weight of the 4.7L then you should be able to bolt them directly onto the 4.7L and directly into the engine cradle brackets. The 4.7L mounts in the 2002 Grand Cherokee appear to be the same as the 3.7L mounts in our Libertys. The 3.7L wet weight is 422 lbs while the 4.7L wet weight is 474 lbs, making for a weight difference of 52 lbs, which shouldn't pose a problem. Another issue is whether the brackets on the engine cradle can themselves support the weight of the 4.7L. Luckily, for obvious reasons, the added bulk of the 4.7L is forward of the old engine, so clearance in the firewall area shouldn't be an issue. The hardest part of this swap is definitely the motor mounts, if only because the dimensions and fit aren't known.

This is very vague. What type of pepper? What size? Should they be hot, or not? [[Special:Contributions/75.155.167.49|75.155.167.49]] ([[User talk:75.155.167.49|talk]]) 02:54, 17 November 2009 (UTC)

== Great recipe; thanks. ==

I took the recipe and performed it as directed--although to make it vegetarian I went straight from the onion base to the spicy paste and mixed them. I also added chopped potato eighths.

To the person above me: I believe the recipe here calls for kashmiri chili. I don't know what that would be though! Hope that helps.

== The recipe is stellar. ==

This is a great recipe, indeed: strong-flavored and extremely filling. I used Chinese hot chilies, because they retain hotness after stewing. I slightly increased the amounts of all ground spices and poured in twice as much water (chicken stock, actually) because I, too, added chopped potatoes, not peas, and wanted to make sure they cook through. The liquid was gone after 30 minutes. If I make this dish again, I'll add more salt - and more chilies :-) [[User:Invidia|Invidia]] ([[User talk:Invidia|talk]]) 04:27, 12 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Ulica Chorzowska widoczna z Silesia City Center.JPG|350px|right|thumb|Katowice]]

This handbook was written especially for those who want to get to know some basics of a very interesting Slavic language. Silesian is spoken in the south-west of Poland in the Silesia region. If you are interested in Polish, you'll probably be in love with Silesian too! After this course you will be proud to say that you can communicate at a basic level in this language.

The course starts from zero and was prepared for non-Polish speakers, but it will also come in handy for Poles interested in getting to know some Silesian, or the natives trying to refresh their knowledge, or learning the Silesian recent codification (this course is written in modern Silesian alphabet, used on the Internet and in the [[:w:szl:Przodńo zajta|Silesian Wikipedia]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Applications of Second Order DEQs|Applications of Second-Order Differential Equations]] '''&gt;''' [[../Motion with a Damping Force/]]

Simple Harmonic Motion with a Damping Force can be used to describe the motion of a mass at the end of a spring under the influence of friction.

==Laws of Motion==
The friction force is considered to obey a linear law, that to say, it is given by the following expression:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F_f}=-\lambda \vec{v}\,&lt;/math&gt; where
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant and represents the coefficient of friction,
*&lt;math&gt;\vec{F_f}\,&lt;/math&gt; represents the friction force and
*&lt;math&gt;\vec{v}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity.
Note that the minus sign indicates that the friction force always opposes the movement. 

==The Differential Equation of the Motion==
The differential equation of the motion with a damping force will be given by:

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;m\ddot x+\lambda \dot{x} + kx=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In order to obtain the leading coefficient equal to '''1''', we divide this equation by the mass:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ddot x+\frac{\lambda}{m}\dot{x}+\frac{k}{m}x=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

===Non-conservation of energy===
We may multiply the equation of motion by the velocity &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}\,&lt;/math&gt; in order to get an integrable form:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;m\ddot x\dot{x}+\lambda\dot{x}^2+k x\dot{x}=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Now we integrate this equation from '''0''' to '''t''' to obtain an expression for the energy:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;m\frac{\dot{x}^2(t)}{2}+\lambda\frac{x^2(t)}{2}=m\frac{\dot{x}^2(0)}{2}+\lambda\frac{x^2(0)}{2}-\frac{k}{2}\int_{0}^{t}\dot{x}^2dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Denoting the mechanical energy by 
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;E(t):=m\frac{\dot{x}^2(t)}{2}+\lambda\frac{x^2(t)}{2}\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
the variation of energy is given by:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;E(t)-E(0)=-\frac{k}{2}\int_{0}^{t}\dot{x}^2dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
That is to say, if the velocity does not vanish, the system is losing energy. Physically speaking, friction converts mechanical energy into thermal energy.

===Initial condition===
With the free motion equation, there are generally two bits of information one must have to appropriately describe the mass's motion.
#The starting position of the mass. &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;
#The starting direction and magnitude of motion. &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;
Generally, one isn't present without the other. For simplicity, we will consider all displacement below the equilibrium point as &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and above as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

For upward motion &lt;math&gt;v&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and for downward motion &lt;math&gt;v&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Solution===
We look for a general solution in the following form:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;x(t) = e^{st}\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
substituting this solution into the equation, we find the quadratic equation:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;m s^2 + \lambda s + k =0\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
the solution of this equation is given by:
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{-\lambda \pm \sqrt{\lambda^2-4mk}}{2m}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Pituitary Adenoma'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Epidemiology==
*Comprise ~10% of intracranial tumors
*On autopsy found in 5-25%
*Male:female 1:1
*Majority present between 30-50 years old
*Genetic predisposition in [[w:Multiple_endocrine_neoplasia_type_1|MEN-1]]
*Benign histologically
**Nonsecretory ~25%
**Secretory (hormonally active) ~75%
*Typically slow growth with insidious onset of symptoms

==Anatomy==
*Pituitary gland is confined within the sella turcica, part of the sphenoid bone. 
**It measures ~1.5 cm
*Divisions
**Anterior pituitary (from Rathke's pouch): prolactin, growth hormone, ACTH, TSH, FSH, LH, and beta endorphin
**Intermediate lobe (from Rathke's pouch): MSH
**Posterior pituitary (from 3rd ventricle): oxytocin, ADH
*Due to the bony sella enclosure, growth of pituitary tumors is upward

==Clinical presentation==
*Incidental imaging finding
*Local compression
**Pituitary stalk: disruption of prolactin suppression from hypothalamus, leading to PRL overproduction
**Optic chiasm: visual symptoms, including bitemporal hemianopsia and loss of color discrimination
**Cavernous sinus: cranial nerve palsies, particularly ocular palsies
**3rd ventricle: hydrocephalus
**Headaches
*Functional secretory symptoms
**Prolactin (~50%)
***Women: galactorrhea and hypoestrogenism, including decreased menstruation, anovulatory infertility, loss of libido, vaginal dryness
***Men: loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, infertility
**Growth hormone (~25%)
***[[w:Acromegaly|Acromegaly]]: bone enlargement in hand/feet/skull, prominent jaw, cardiomegaly, heat intolerance, weight gain
**ACTH (~20%)
***[[w:Cushing%27s_syndrome|Cushing's disease]]: central obesity (moon facies, buffalo hump), thin skin with striae, hirsutism
***[[w:Nelson%27s_syndrome|Nelson's syndrome]]: hyperpigmentation and muscle weakness
**TSH (&lt;1%)
***[[w:Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroid symptoms]]
**Other hormonal tumors are rare

==Diagnosis==
*MRI
*Endocrine evaluation
**Prolactin level (&gt;100 ng/ml)
**Basal GH level (&gt;10 ng/ml), IGF-1 level, glucose suppression
**Serum ACTH, free cortisol, dexamethasone suppression (&gt;10 ug/ml after 8 hours)
**TSH, T3, T4
**FSH, LH, plasma estradiol, testosterone
*Skeletal survey in acromegaly

==Staging==
*By tumor size
**Microadenoma (&lt;1 cm)
**Macroadenoma (&gt;1 cm)
*By expansion or erosion of the sella (PMID 945663), not uniformly accepted
**Grade 0: Intrapituitary microadenoma with normal sellar appearance
**Grade I: Normal-sized sella (15 × 12 mm) with asymmetry of the floor
**Grade II: Enlarged sella with an intact floor
**Grade III: Localized erosion or destruction of the sellar floor
**Grade IV: Diffusely eroded or destroyed floor


==Treatment Overview==
*Observation for select nonsecreting microadenomas and small prolactinomas
*Microadenoma, not secreting prolactin: surgery
*Microadenoma, secreting prolactin: bromocriptine
*Macroadenoma: multimodality approach, typically surgery, if failed to suppress biochemically, then adjuvant/salvage RT

==Medical Management==
*Primary approach for prolactinomas
**Dopamine agonists - bromocriptine, cabergoline
*Salvage approach for acromegaly, if inadquate control after surgery
**Somatostatin analogues - octreotide, lanreotide
*Symptomatic management for Cushing's disease
**Ketoconazole to suppress cortisol secretion in adrenal glands

==Surgery==
*Goal: 
**Decompress local symptoms 
**Normalize endocrine function for secreting tumors
*Standard surgical approach is a transsphenoidal resection, either microsurgial or transsphenoidal
*For localized secretory tumors, surgical cure rate is 80-90%
*With biochemical failure, on second surgery tumor often found extending through dura into cavernous sinus. Success rate on reoperation tends to be lower
*Mortality 0.5%, significant morbidity ~1.5%

==Conventional External Beam==
*Control of hypersecretion (Perez &amp; Brady)
**Acromegaly ~80%
**Cushing's disease 50-80%
**Hyperprolactinemia ~30%

==Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS)==
*'''Multi-Institutional; 2005''' PMID 15871511 -- &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery for pituitary adenomas: an intermediate review of its safety, efficacy, and role in the neurosurgical treatment armamentarium.&quot; (Sheehan JP, J Neurosurg. 2005 Apr;102(4):678-91.)
**Systematic literature review. 35 studies, 1621 patients treated with SRS. 
**Outcome: Tumor size control ~90%; wide variability in endocrine control
**Toxicity: Risk of hypopituitarism, 2nd tumors, and cerebral vasculopathy appeared less than fractionated RT
**Conclusion: SRS offeres both safe and effective treatment for recurrent or residual pituitary adenomas; in rare instances it may be the best initial treatment

==Proton Therapy==

==Radiotherapy vs Observation==
*'''Netherlands''' (1979-98) PMID 17197121 -- &quot;Immediate postoperative radiotherapy in residual nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma: beneficial effect on local control without additional negative impact on pituitary function and life expectancy.&quot; (van den Bergh AC, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Mar 1;67(3):863-9.)
**Cohort study. 122 pts with nonfunctioning adenomas. 1) Group 1 (Radiotherapy) / residual disease - 76 pts (62%), immediate postoperative radiotherapy at a median of 5.8 months. 2) Group 2 (Observation) / residual disease - 28 pts (23%). 3) Group 3 (No Residual) - 18 pts (15%). 3 pts in group 3 received immediate post-op RT. 
**Median f/u 93 months (Group 1), 71 months (Group 2). 
**Group 1 (RT): progression in 3 of 76 pts (4%). Local control rate 95% at 5 and 10 years. 
**Group 2 (Obs): progression in 16 of 28 pts (57%). Local control rate 49% and 22% at 5 and 10 years. 14 of the 16 pts received RT for salvage (6 RT only, 8 RT + surgery). Control rate after salvage RT 95%.
**Group 3 (No Residual): progression in 1 of 18 pts (6%). 
**Endocrine function: no difference between Groups 1 and 2.
**Conclusion: &quot;Immediate postoperative radiotherapy provides a marked improvement of local control among patients with residual NFA compared with surgery alone, without an additional deleterious effect on pituitary function and life expectancy.&quot;</text>

:No problem. Good luck with your goal, and hopefully you stay around and help us out. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 21:31, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

::Yes, most books are, sadly, inactive. But if you go to Recent Changes (it's over under navigation) you can probably find books that are more active than others. If you want to find books that are complete you should go to Featured Books (also under navigation). [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 00:00, 21 June 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Manchu chinese.jpg|thumb|right|500px]]
This book is a basic textbook for those who wish to learn the Manchu language. The book consists of 24 lessons, and can be divided into three sections:

'''Section 1: Introduction to Manchu grammar and the Manchu script'''

This section includes 12 lessons, each of which includes a short text or dialogue followed by a vocabulary list and then an introduction to a particular grammatical feature of the language. 

Note: 
* Lesson 11 is a summary of all the grammatical features from lessons 1-10 and can be used for revision or can be printed out to be used as a basic Manchu grammar. 
* The Manchu script is not taught until lesson 12 (contrary to most textbooks) due to the difficult nature of the script and the fact that it is much easier to learn the script once you possess a basic vocabulary and understanding of the phonetic features of the Manchu language.

'''Section 2: Readings in the Manchu Language''' 

This section includes 12 readings in the Manchu Language. Each reading includes a vocabulary list, as well as a translation and explanation of the text. 

'''Section 3: Other information on the Manchu Language''' 

This section includes a vocabulary list, further vocabulary as well as some general information on Tungusic languages and a brief introduction to the Jurchen language and script. 

At the bottom of the page there is also a link to the [[Manchu/Library|Online Library of Manchu Language Texts]] which is currently part of this Wikibook. The library is in development.

== Language ==

Manchu is a Manchu-Tungusic language spoken in Northeast China; it used to be the language of the Manchus, and the official language of the Qing dynasty. Nowdays most Manchus speak Chinese and there are far fewer than 60 native speakers of Manchu out of a total of more than 10 million ethnic Manchus. Most native speakers now live in Sanjiazi (三家子) which is a small village about 40km north of Qiqihar (齐齐哈尔) in Heilongjiang province. Although the spoken language is nearly extinct in North East China, the Manchu language lives on in the form of Sibe, which still has 30,000 speakers most of which live in Cabcal Sibe Autonomous County (察布查尔錫伯自治县) near Ili in Xinjiang province, Western China.

Manchu is a member of the Manchu-Tungusic language family which is believed by some scholars to be a branch of the Altaic language family (along with Mongolic and Turkic). Manchu is an agglutinative language that features both vowel harmony and a Subject-Object-Verb sentence structure. Although it is not particularly hard to learn (especially in comparison to Chinese) many would wonder why you would bother learning a language that is spoken by so few people and whose future does not look that promising. Some reasons could include:
* An interest in Manchu-Tungusic languages
* An interest in Qing dynasty history, especially considering the amount of archival material in Manchu
* General intellectual curiosity
* To gain a deeper understanding of Manchu culture
* The script is pretty
* It is an easy way to read the Chinese classics (most of them were translated into Manchu)

==The different sounds of the Manchu language==

The Manchu script consists of 24 Manchu letters to write 25 native Manchu sounds, and 10 letters to write sounds found in Chinese (these 10 letters are  k', g', h', ts', dz', zh', sy' cy', jy' xy' and are dealt with in lesson 12). The 24 native Manchu letters include:

{|
|-
|6 vowels:
| a,e,i,o,u,ū
|-
|18 consonants:
|n,k,g,h,b,p,s,š,t,d,l,m,c,j,y,r,f,w
|-
|......................................
|......................................
|-
|}

===Vowels===

Manchu has the 6 short vowels mentioned above, two long vowels, 7 diphthongs and 1 triphthong:
{|
|-
|Short vowels: 
|a,e,i,o,u,ū
|-
|Long vowels: 
|ii,oo
|-
|Diphthongs: 
|ai,ei,oi,ui,io,ao,eo,
|-
|Triphthong:
|ioi
|-
|......................................
|......................................
|-
|}

===Consonants===

As for consonants, in addition to the 18 consonants mentioned above Manchu has one combined consonant ‘rs’ and two doubled consonants ‘tt’ and ‘šš’.

Notes:

*	Of the 18 consonants, the two that are not pronounced like in English are ‘š’ which sounds like ‘sh’ and ‘c’ which sounds like ‘ch’.
*	The phoneme ‘ng’ is also found in the Manchu language but is not a separate letter.
*	The Manchu script contains front and back versions of ‘k’, ‘g’, ‘h’, ‘d’, and ‘t’.
*       In Manchu transliterations and online the vowel 'ū' is also often written as 'v'
*       In Manchu transliterations and online the consonant 'š' is also often written as 'sh' or 'x'
* No Manchu words start with ‘r’ or two or more consonants. 
* As for endings, Manchu words end in either a vowel or ‘n’. Some loanwords do however end in ‘ng’ e.g. (王 wáng – king). In this respect, it is close to being an open syllable language. Syllables other than the last, however, can have other consonant endings (see next bullet point).
* There are sometimes clusters of consonants between vowels such as in ‘abka’ (heaven) and ‘ilha’ (flower) but these are the final and initial consonants of two separate syllables. In most words however, vowels are separated by single consonants.

==Syllable structure in Manchu==

The Manchu language has the following syllable structures:

{|
|-
|'''Manchu&lt;br&gt; Syllable&lt;br&gt; Structure'''&lt;br&gt;    
|'''Example'''
|-
|V
|‘a-’ in a-ma (father)
|-
|VV
|‘ai’ what
|-
|VC 
|‘am-‘ in am-ban (official)
|-
|VCC
|‘ašš-‘ in aššasun (verb)
|-
|CV
|‘du-’ in du-ka (gate)
|-
|CVV
|‘moo’ (wood)
|-
|CVVC
|‘duin’ (four)
|-
|CVC
|‘den’ (high)
|-
|CVCC
|‘fašš-‘ in fašš-an (effort)
|-
|CVVV
|‘elioi’ (吕 - a Chinese surname)
|-
|}

Out of the above syllable structures, CVVV is extremely rare as it can only occur with the triphthong ‘ioi’; and both VCC and CVCC are also quite rare as they can only occur with one of the two doubled consonants ‘tt’ or ‘šš’ or with the combined consonants ‘rs’.

==Vowel harmony==

The Manchu language is subject to the rules of vowel harmony. This means that only certain vowels can appear together in the same word and that the vowel in the first syllable of a word must be of the same type as the vowel in the second syllable. Note: vowel harmony in Manchu isn’t as strict as in Turkic or Mongolic languages. Manchu vowels fall into the following three categories:

* Front vowels (阴性)		e
* Back vowels (阳性)		a,o,ū
* Neutral vowels (中性)		u,i

In theory, front and back vowels can not exist in the same word, although there are some examples of this (ajige - small). However, neutral vowels can exist with both front and back vowels. There are two forms of vowel harmony:


===Vowel harmony within a stem===
This form of vowel harmony involves the vowels within a particular stem (a word with no suffixes) harmonising. In general one word will only have the following combinations of vowels (the first vowel is the vowel in the first syllable):
&lt;!--
{|
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|‘a’ and one of 
|‘a’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘ū’ 
|-
|‘e’ and one of
|‘e’, ‘i’, ‘u’
|-
|‘i’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘ū’
|-
|‘o’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘ū’
|-
|‘u’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘u’, ‘ū’
|-
|‘v’ and one of 
|‘a’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘ū’  
|-
|}
--&gt;

|- 
||   ||   ||   || X || X || X || style=&quot;background:#ffde00;&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}


Note: the vowel ‘o’ vary rarely exists in a word with other vowels, and if it does it is nearly always with ‘a’,’ū’,’i’ or occasionally ‘e’, but basically never with ‘u’.
The vowels ‘u’ and ‘i’ can go with all other vowels

===Stem-suffix vowel harmony===

Stem-suffix vowel harmony involves the vowels of a stem harmonising with the vowels of whatever suffix is attached to that stem. The rules are a bit different for stems with single, double or multiple syllables:


'''Single Syllable Stems'''
{|
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|'''Stem'''    
|'''Suffix'''
|-
|a    
|a
|-
|-
|o    
|o
|-
|e    
|e
|-
|i,u    
|Usually 'e'
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|}


'''Double Syllable Stems'''
{|
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|'''Stem'''    
|'''Suffix'''
|-
|a-a, a-ū, a-u, o-i, ū-i, a-i, u-i, i-i
|a
|-
|o-o, a-o
|o
|-
|e-e, o-e, e-u, e-i, i-u, u-u
|e
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................   
|-
|}

* Note: there are exceptions to the above rules for double syllable stems, but in most cases the above rules hold.


'''Multiple Syllable Stems'''

* In general, stems terminating in 'a', 'e' or 'o' take the corresponding vowel in the suffix. 
* Stems with multiple syllables terminating in 'i' or 'u' and proceded by 'e' generally take 'e' in the suffix.
* Stems with multiple syllables terminating in 'i' or 'u' and proceded by 'a', 'u' or 'ū' generally take 'a' in the suffix.
* Stems with multiple syllables with 'u' and 'ū' generally take 'a' in the suffix.


Notes: 
* Some suffixes such as ‘de’ ‘-bu’ etc are fixed and do not change.
* Some words use the vowels ‘a’ and ‘e’ to distinguish between masculine and feminine concepts, e.g. haha (man), hehe (woman).
* There are two forms of the letters ‘k’, ‘g’, and ‘h’, a back form for the vowels ‘a’,’o’,’ū’, and a front form for the vowels ‘e’,’u’,’i’. 
* There are also two forms of the letters ‘d’, and ‘t’, a back form for the letters ‘a’, ‘o’, ‘i’, and a front form for the letters ‘e’ and ‘u’.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to Image Processing Toolbox==

The core MATLAB package comes with several rudimentary functions (to be described later) that can be used to load, save, and perform custom functions on images. However, it is often necessary to perform more complicated operations on images. The image processing toolbox allows such manipulations as:

* Direct visualization of images in MATLAB
* Color space conversions (e.g. between [[w:RGB|RGB]], [[w:HSL and HSV|HSV]], [[w:CIELAB|L*a*b*]], and so on)
* Object grouping and data collection
* Filtering and fast convolution
* Fourier analysis of images
* Image arithmetic
* Morphological operations

and many others. 

{{TODO|This is a rather incomplete introduction, expand it to include the other capabilities of the toolbox}}

==MATLAB built-in functions==

To load an image into MATLAB, you can use the &quot;import data&quot; GUI (the same way as you would for a text file or similar), or you can use the &quot;imread&quot; function. To use &quot;imread&quot;, you must have the directory where the image is located in your list of directories. Then use the syntax:

 &gt;&gt; myimage = imread('myimage.extension');

Use of a semicolon is recommended especially here since images contain large amounts of data.

If the image is a color image, MATLAB will (for most data formats that are compatible with it) convert the image data to the RGB color space by default. The separate channels are represented by the ''third dimension'' of the image. The following code separates the channels of the image and indicates the color of each channel.

 &gt;&gt; redchannel = myimage(:,:,1);
 &gt;&gt; greenchannel = myimage(:,:,2);
 &gt;&gt; bluechannel = myimage(:,:,3);

{{NOTE|Care must be taken when doing calculations with images because most image formats are imported as class UINT8, not as class double, to save space. There are many operations which cannot be performed on UINT8 arrays (or, for that matter, on arrays with more than two dimensions). Some of these can be circumvented by using MATLAB's image arithmetic functions but sometimes it will be necessary to convert the image or a portion of it to class '''double''' to manipulate it.}}

Another default function in MATLAB can be used to save images to a new file. The function, &quot;imwrite&quot;, accepts two different syntaxes:

 &gt;&gt; imwrite(myimage, 'nameoffile.extension')

or

 &gt;&gt; imwrite(myimage, 'nameoffile', 'extension')

When using the second syntax, do not use a period before the extension. See the MATLAB documentation for supported file types for import and export.

== MATLAB's image arithmetic functions ==

MATLAB by default imports most images as class '''uint8''', which is not supported by the native addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division functions. In order to overcome this, one option is to convert the images to class '''double'''. However, this will cause memory issues if a large number of images are to be used, or if the images are large. It is also very slow. Therefore, MATLAB provides a better option in its arithmetic functions. MATLAB can perform the following operations using its special arithmetic functions for integers (they also work if either A or B is a constant value):

* imadd(A, B): add two images A and B (equivalent to A + B, due to an operator overload, but this syntax will not work without the image analysis toolbox so it is not recommended, since it'll give a more difficult error to track down in its absence than &quot;function not found&quot;)
* imsubtract(A, B): Subtract two images A and B (equivalent to A - B, but again not recommended since it won't work without the toolbox)
* immultiply(A, B): Elementwise multiplication of two images A and B. Equivalent to A.*B.
* imdivide(A, B): Elementwise division of two images A and B. Equivalent to A./B 
* imlincomb(K1, A1, K2, A2, ..., C): Linear combinations of images A1, A2, etc. This means you end up with &lt;math&gt; K1*A1 + K2*A2 + ... + C &lt;/math&gt;. This is more efficient than using e.g. &lt;math&gt; immultiply(K1, A1) + immultiply(K2, A2) &lt;/math&gt; because the latter rounds after every operation, leading to sometimes significant errors, while the former only rounds at the end.

== Visualization of images ==

To visualize an image or a section of an image, use the ''imshow'' function:

 &gt;&gt; imshow(myimage);

This will show a figure (often scaled down) of the image. You should not attempt to copy this and paste into another program, the RGB values resulting will be different. Use imwrite instead.

== Color space changes and cforms ==

{{TODO|Describe the 'makecform' function, the form of the cform struct, and how to perform the color conversions provided in this function}}

=== A note on color space conversions ===

Note that when converting from device-specific color spaces like RGB to non-device-specific spaces like LAB or XYZ, some inaccuracy will inevitably arise. One reason for this is that RGB values as given by MATLAB are often encoded with a gamma from the camera (and given another gamma by the monitor before displayed on the screen), which makes the relationship between the RGB and LAB values dependent on the internals of the camera and also nonlinear (and difficult to determine accurately). As an approximation, one can often use a power-law function to arrive at the un-modified RGB values, which in theory should be linearly correlated with the LAB values of each pixel:

&lt;math&gt; R' = (R/255)^{1/\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; G' = (G/255)^{1/\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; B' = (B/255)^{1/\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that these equations assume R, G, and B are on the range from 0 to 255, and the computation requires that R, G, and B be converted to class '''double''' from the default class uint8.

== Image filtering ==

MATLAB uses one of two methods, '''correlation''' or '''convolution''', to filter various images. The two operations are identical except convolution rotates the filter matrix 180o before filtering, while correlation keeps it the same. 

=== Convolution ===

{{TODO|Show the principle of the calculation}}

Direct convolution is implemented using both the ''conv2'' method and the ''imfilter'' function. For images, since the filter is much smaller than the image, the direct method implemented in ''imfilter'' (which uses a MEX function to increase speed) is usually faster.

=== FFT method ===

It can be shown that convolution in the space domain (as described earlier) is equivalent to multiplication in the Fourier domain:

&lt;math&gt; A \mbox{ o } B = F^-1 (F(A) * F(B)) &lt;/math&gt;

where F is the Fourier transform operator. If A and B are nearly the same size, performing the Fourier transform of both A and B, multiplying, and inverting the result is often faster than performing the computation directly.

In order to use this method, it is necessary to pad the smaller of A and B with zeros so that both A and B are the same size. The method is actually fastest if both A and B are padded so that they have lengths of a power of 2, since the FFT algorithm is optimized for these sizes. After forming the padded matrices A' and B', compute the FFT of both matrices (using the fft2 function), multiply them, and invert them to find the full convolution (padded with many zeros). Following is some sample code implementing this method, and returning the convolution equivalent to the 'same' parameter in MATLAB:

{{TODO|Put in the code to do this}}


=== Using the image analysis toolbox ===

Filters can be used to blur images in different ways, or to sharpen them. The function ''fspecial'' contains a number of pre-defined filters that you can use for these purposes. The syntax for this function is:

 &gt;&gt; filter = fspecial(''typeoffilter'', parameters);

If no parameters are provided, the default size of the filter is different depending on the type of filter; see [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/images/index.html?/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/images/fspecial.html the MATLAB documentation page] for details. Some other types of filter also have other options, such as the standard deviation in a Gaussian filter.

{{TODO|Make some example images to show the effects of each of these filters}}

You can also use your own filters by simply defining them as a matrix.

{{TODO|Talk about filter design a little}}

To filter an image, MATLAB replaces each pixel of the image with a weighted average of the surrounding pixels. The weights are determined by the values of the filter, and the number of surrounding pixels is determined by the size of the filter used. MATLAB includes a function to do the filtering: ''imfilter''

 &gt;&gt; newimage = imfilter(myimage, filter, parameters);

There are several possible parameters that determine how MATLAB deals with pixels on the edges of an image (since the weighted average at the edges needs something to weigh beyond the image borders). These include padding it with a constant (give imfilter a number in the ''parameters'' spot), reflecting the image across the border (parameters = 'symmetric'),assuming the image is periodic (parameters = 'circular'), or duplicating border pixel values (parameters = 'replicate'). The best method to use depends on the application, so it is best to experiment with them.

Another parameter you can pass is the choice of correlation vs. convolution. Correlation is used by default; pass 'conv' to imfilter to use convolution. Be aware that correlation will rotate your filter, be prepared for this if it is intended to have effects in a certain direction on the image.

==Grammar==



===Nouns=== 

Manchu nouns have number and case but do not really have gender. Nouns can consist solely of a stem such as 'bithe' (book), be formed by adding suffixes to other words, or be formed by adding two nouns together such as 'ahūn deo' (brothers).


The most common suffixes that can be added to words to form nouns include:

{|
|-
|............................................................
|............................................................
|-
|'''Suffixes used with verb stems	'''
|'''Examples'''
|-
| -n	
|taci'''n''' – Learning. From the verb stem '''taci'''mbi (to study)
|-
| -gan, -gen, -gon, -han, -hen, -hon	
|niru'''gan''' – Drawing. From the verb stem '''niru'''mbi (to draw)
|-
| -ku, -kū	
|ana'''kū''' - Key. From the verb stem '''ana'''mbi (to push)
|-
| -cun	
|buye'''cun''' - Love. From the verb stem '''buye'''mbi (to love)
|-
|'''Suffixes used with nouns and verbs'''
|'''Examples'''
|-
| -si	
|usi'''si''' – Farmer. From the noun usin (field)
|-
| -ci	
|adu'''ci'''  - Herdsman. From the noun adun (herd)
|-
| -ji, -lji, -mji, -nju	
|boigo'''ji''' – Host. From the noun boigon (family)
|-
|............................................................
|............................................................
|-
|}


Note: of the above suffixes, the suffixes –ku,-kū are used for instruments, the suffix –cun is used for abstract concepts, and the suffixes –si, -ci, and –ji are used to denote people by what they do (Gorelova, M. P.198). When adding suffixes to nouns, the final ‘-n’ is often dropped.


====Gender of Manchu Nouns====

Nouns usually do not have gender, although some obviously masculine nouns have masculine vowels, while feminine nouns have feminine vowels, e.g. haha (man), hehe (woman), ama (father) and eme (mother).


====Number:====

There are several ways to express the plural in Manchu:

&lt;u&gt;Through the use of the suffix -sa (-se, -so, -si)&lt;/u&gt;
* E.g. manju'''sa''' - Manchu'''s'''
&lt;u&gt;Through use of one of the suffixes -ta, -te, -ri.&lt;/u&gt;
* This is mostly used for family relationships (note final 'n' is often omitted).
* E.g. ama'''ta''' - father'''s'''
* The suffix '-ri' is only used with a few words. E.g. mafa'''ri''' - grandfathers/ancestors
&lt;u&gt;Through the use of adjectives&lt;/u&gt;
* like geren (many/all), eiten (all), tumen (a myriad) or verbally with gemu (all)
* E.g. tumen jaka - The myriad things (万物)


====Case====

Manchu has 5 different cases. Cases can be attached to the proceeding noun or written seperately:

&lt;u&gt;Nominative (no suffix).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This is the natural case and has no suffix. 
* E.g. bithe - book

&lt;u&gt;Genitive (-i, -ni after -ng).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to show the possessive. The suffix -i (-ni) can also be used for instrumental case which shows the means or cause of which something happens. 
* E.g. ere oci mini eme '''i''' bithe - This is my mother''''s''' book (''Possessive'')
* E.g. mafa gurun '''i''' ilha - The fatherland''''s''' flowers (''Possessive'')
* E.g. manju gisun '''i''' arambi - To write '''by means of''' Manchu (''Insturmental'')

&lt;u&gt;Dative/Locative (-de).&lt;/u&gt;
*This case is used to show location or direction (at/to).
* E.g. Direction:  Harbin '''de''' genehe - He went '''to''' Harbin (''Dative'')
* E.g. Location:  Harbin '''de''' manjusa labdu - There are many Manchus '''in''' Harbin (''Locative'')
* E.g. Beijing '''de''' niyengniyeri isinaha - '''In''' Beijing spring has arrived

&lt;u&gt;Accusative (-be).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to make a noun the direct object of an action.
* E.g. i ere bithe '''be''' mini eme de buha - He gave '''this''' book to my mother 
* E.g. te mini eme inenggidari manju gisun '''be''' tacimbi - Now my mother studies '''Manchu''' everyday.
* E.g. be mafa gurun '''be''' hairambi - We love the '''fatherland''' 

&lt;u&gt;Ablative (-ci).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to show point of departure or for comparison.
* E.g. monggo gurun '''ci''' jihe niyalma - The people who came '''from''' Mongolia (''Point of departure'')
* E.g. nikan gisun '''ci''' manju gisun ja - Manchu is easier '''than''' Chinese (''Comparison'')
* E.g. emu inenggi '''ci''' emu inenggi halukan oho - Each day is hotter '''than''' the one before (''Comparison'')

===Pronouns===


====Personal pronouns====

As with nouns, personal pronouns in Manchu also have different cases. The normal form of Manchu personal pronouns is expressed by using the nominative case. See following table for list of all personal pronouns in the 5 different cases:

{| 
|.....................................................
|.................................

|cende
|cembe
|cenci
|-
|.....................................................

|.................................
|-
|}

* The personal pronoun in the nominative case is the ordinary form of the pronoun, e.g. bi = I, si = you, i = he/she/it, be = we (excl.), muse = we (incl.), suwe = you (plural), ce = they/them
* For the singular first personal pronoun &quot;I&quot; the different forms are: nominative '''bi''' &quot;I&quot;; genitive '''mini''' &quot;my&quot;; dative/locative '''minde''' &quot;to/at me&quot;; accusative '''mimbe''' &quot;me&quot;; ablative '''minci''' &quot;from me&quot;. All the other personal pronouns follow the same pattern. 
* As with Chinese, Manchu has two versions of the 1st plural personal pronoun: an exclusive version ‘be’, and an inclusive version ‘muse’.
* To express the idea of oneself, you would use the genitive form of the personal pronoun and follow it with the word ‘beye’ (body). E.g. mini beye (myself), sini beye (yourself).
* The possessive pronoun is formed by adding the suffix ‘-ngge’ after the genitive form of the personal pronoun. E.g. mini-ngge (mine). Ere bithe miningge (this book is mine). 
* The suffix '-ngge' is a possessive suffix which does not change with the rules of vowel harmony. When written it is proceeded by the genetive case and therefore becomes one of '-ingge' or '-ningge'. In the case of use with personal pronouns, it is already proceeded by the genitive form of the pronoun so remains '-ngge'. It can be translated as belong to, and is often written separately from the noun. E.g. ejen ningge - belonging to the master. 

Now for some examples of the different cases:

'''Nominative'''
* '''bi''' manju gisun be tacimbi - '''I''' study the Manchu language 
* '''i''' oci manju niyalma - '''He''' is Manchu

'''Genitive'''
* '''mini''' gucu oci manju niyalma - '''My''' friend is Manchu
* '''meni''' eme oci mafa gurun - '''Our''' mother is the fatherland

'''Dative/Locative'''
* '''sinde''' ai baita bi? - What issue do '''you (at)''' have?
* tere emu debtelin (mw for book) bithe be '''minde''' buki (to give imp) - Can you please give '''(to) me''' this book

'''Accusative'''
* mafa gurun '''membe''' ujime hvwaxabuha - The fatherland raised '''us (object)'''
* bi '''cembe''' emu biya onggolo takaha - I met '''him (object)''' one month ago 

'''Ablative'''
* i '''minci''' juwe se ajige - He is two years younger '''than me'''
* si '''minci''' tulgiyen we takambi? - Apart '''from me''' who do you know?

====Demonstrative pronouns====

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Mashuwen, welcome to Wikibooks! I have looked over your contributions and they are looking quite good so far. However, I must point you to the [[WB:NC|naming convention]], which defines how we designate subpages within the same book. Basically, if you want to link to a page named &quot;pagename&quot; from your title page [[Manchu]], you make a link to &lt;nowiki&gt; [[Manchu/pagename]] &lt;/nowiki&gt; rather than &lt;nowiki&gt; [[pagename]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;. The slash signifies that the page is part of the same book. I'll fix the existing pages to fit the convention, just please keep it in mind for any new pages you wish to add.

Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. Regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt; ([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk to me]]) &lt;/small&gt; 02:33, 21 June 2008 (UTC)
:Hi, I would like to remember you that the numeration of headers in pages is made automatically by the software, so please don't add numbers between &quot;==&quot;. Also, I'd like to ask you to categorize your pages in &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:manchu]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Thank you, have a nice work, --[[User:Ramac|Ramac]] ([[User talk:Ramac|talk]]) 10:03, 28 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Style Rule Notes Drop==
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
{{dropimage|align=center|1=CSS Style Notes|2=&lt;table width=600px align=center&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;HTML Attributes&lt;/big&gt;'''
HTML attributes include such items as ''cellpadding'', ''cellspacing'', and ''align''.   There are also several others which apply to tables.   They all use two terms separated by an equals sign.   It is usual for several such items to be set in the table line.   The general format is:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;attribute1=value1 attribute1=value2 attributeN=valueN&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Note in the above example that the rules are separated by a space.   Another listing, this time with a practical example for the three mentioned attributes is:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;cellpadding=10px cellspacing=8px align=center&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
  
'''&lt;big&gt;CSS Styles&lt;/big&gt;'''
CSS styles have many more formatting rules than do the HTML attributes.   They include all of the colouring, fonts, spacing, padding, margin, and other items.   There are often several of these in a table element, with the table line itself containing most.   The general format is:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style = &quot;property1:value1; property2:value2; ... propertyN:valueN;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Note from the above general form:
:*'''Each style rule''' ''comprises'' a property and a value.
:*'''Separators ''between'' the properties''' and values are ''full colons''.
:*'''Separators ''between'' the style rules''' themselves are ''semi-colons''.
:*'''The entire set''' of rules is ''enclosed'' in double quotes.
:*'''The set forms''' the right hand side of an expression equated to ''style''.
Another listing, which could be placed in a table element, a row element, or a cell element, to set their background and text colors, is just:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;background:lightyellow; color:royalblue;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
Note that the color names have been used, and that they are each spelled as one word.   The two formatting methods are mixed frequently in the same lines as follows:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;align=right width=300px style=&quot;background:lightyellow; color:royalblue;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

'''&lt;big&gt;CSS Style Punctuation Rules&lt;/big&gt;'''
Sometimes style rules look a bit compact and need spread out to make them more readable.  The rules for spacing ''between'' the table elements themselves was covered earlier.  These notes apply to the punctuation '''within a CSS statement'''.

'''Main Points to Avoid'''

*'''Line breaks are ''not'' permitted ''within'' style expressions'''.
*'''Colons and semi-colons must ''not'' have a space ''before'' them.'''

'''These have Latitude'''

*Spaces ''after'' colons and semi-colons are OK.
*Space between a table, row, or cell symbol and the word ''style'' is OK.
*Space around any ''equals'' symbol is OK.
*Space between the style rules and their bounding quotes is OK.
*Optionally, a semi-colon can be placed immediately ''after'' the last style rule.

'''In addition'''

*Compound values like  &lt;nowiki&gt;''2px solid black''&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''must'' be space-separated.
*Attributes ''must'' be separated from CSS style expressions with space.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Cell Spacing Drop Control==
----
{{dropimage|hbgc=floralwhite|width=300px|1=Cell Spacing Summary|2=&lt;table width=500px&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Cellspacing notes'''&lt;/big&gt;
----
::*'''There are two ways to set cell spacing'''; using an ''HTML attribute'' called '''cellspacing''', or using the ''style property'' combination '''border-collapse''' and  '''border-spacing.'''   See the table rules within the main page for the syntax.

::*'''There can be problems''' with the cellspacing attribute.   For example, when a table is to be displayed as the ''parameter of a template'', the template is likely to fail.   To avoid it, the table should be made in HTML, the cellspacing attribute should be removed, and the styles properties should be used for the cell spacing. 

::*'''The border-spacing code''' can take two forms depending upon whether uniform spacing is required or horizontal spacing different from the vertical.   This style sets uniform spacing:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:10px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
and this version sets the horizontal as half that of the vertical cell spacing:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:10px 20px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
::*'''The style property pair functions well''' only when the border-collapse property is present and set to ''separate'', and there is a clear intent as to the spacing.   In some other settings there can be overlaps of borders, and unexpected spacings.

::*'''When both of these two properties is missing''', the cellspacing attribute will set the spacing. 

::*'''The priorities work like this'''.   The border-spacing property's value will '''supersede''' the cellspacing attribute when both are present.   If the border-spacing property is ''omitted'', then the attribute will set the spacing.   Clearly, provided that the pair of style properties is present and specified, the attribute might also be present without any mishap.  

::*'''For best results''', '''always specify both''' ''border-collapse'' and ''border-spacing'' and '''set a spacing value'''.   This is the case even when the intention is to set the collapsed state with zero border-spacing.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

==Table Spaces==
----
{{dropimage|align=center|1=The Table Work Spaces|2=[[image:main table spaces.jpg|600px|center]]
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''The Table Design Spaces'''&lt;/big&gt;
----
Tables have several spaces that require attention in design; in particular, margins, padding, and cell spacing. Refer to the graphic above and the descripions below for their details.

*'''Margins''' are used to create a space between the table and adjacent items on a page.   The four sides of a table can have different margins for each side, or all the same.   In addition to margin, there is a related style property which allows the table to place itself clear of other objects and text.   Margins are not shown on the above graphic. This property is set in the table line styles as follows:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;margin:10px 10px 20px 0px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} 
This code applies table margins to all sides at once, in the sequence corresponding to top, right, bottom, and left. This sequence is common for many such properties. 
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
*'''Table padding''' describes an area immediately within the outer table border. (Table space A in the graphic).   It is used to improve appearance when the contents need a bit more space.   It too can be specified for all sides separately or all together.   This property is set in the table line styles as follows:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;padding:20px 10px 20px 10px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
where this code applies table padding to all sides at once, in the sequence corresponding to top, right, bottom, and left.  This property has no effect on other parts of the table when used in the table line.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
*'''Table spacing''' describes an area around every cell. (Table space B in the graphic).   It exists at the top and sides of the table in addition to any table padding which may be in use.   One value sets the spacing for all of the cells. Adjusting the appearance of parts of borders makes sense only when there is some cell spacing to separate the cell borders.   This CSS property applies only when the borders are not collapsed.  An extra property is therefore needed to set the stage for spacing.   The overall combination for cell spacing in the table line, becomes:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;border-collapse:separate;border-spacing:10px&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
::*''Another'' cellspacing method exists; there is an HTML attribute for ''cellspacing'', which can also set the spacing without the need for a CSS style.   There are issues in its use for certain purposes, such as when an HTML table is to go into some sort of template; it can prevent operation at such times, or not work at all.   When this problem occurs, the above CSS version should be used to correct the problem. It is mentioned here because outside of these exceptions it is quite useful; it needs no stage setting over collapsed or separated borders, and has the typical form:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;cellspacing=10px&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
*'''Cell padding''' describes the space around text in a cell and separates it from the cell border. (Table space C in the graphic). It has an identical code description to ''table padding'' except that it is written in the ''cell'' line.
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;style=&quot;padding:10px 5px 10px 5px;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
It ''cannot'' be written in a style within a ''row'', so when there is much custom padding to be done, any number of style statements for cells become necessary.  There is an HTML attribute which can apply ''padding'' to all cells at once, and it written in the ''table'' line.  It has few problems, unlike the spacing attribute.   It has the typical form:
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;cellpadding=10px&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
*'''Table caption''' is a line of text which is placed above the table and is centered.   This text clearly comes ''inside'' the top margin, and if added, will shift the table downwards slightly.  There is a property to move it to either side or below the table, but the CSS property is not available for all browsers.}}

==Styling the Preformatting Tags==

===The Use of the White-space Property's Pre-wrap Value===
----
At the time of writing, (July 2008), Opera 8 correctly depicts the use of Pre-wrap.  Other browsers are just getting around to adjusting their specifications for its use.   The feature has existed in all CSS versions since CSS 2.1.   It is said that it will be included soon in Firefox version 3, though it is unclear at which point the Internet Explorer will accommodate this feature.   Despite the various browser incompatibilities, it is proposed to describe the use of this method with the hope that the matter will be soon resolved.

The property value finds use in displaying blocks of mark up code with long lines.   At the same time, styling methods are found useful to modify the appearance of the preformatting tags.
In determining whether or not a given browser supports this property value, note whether or not overflow is apparent in the ''narrow'' yellow box example below, and whether or not the box width extends to the right margin; if they do , then the browser ''cannot'' make any use of this feature.

To nonetheless see how the method can be used on a browser which ''can'' display it, follow the sequence of Wikitext code listings below.
      
'''Listing the following table code block in preformatting tags results in overflow...'''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!--Pre-wrap wraps long lines; the rest preformatted.--&gt;
{| cellpadding=7px cellspacing=5px style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgray; font-style:italic; background: transparent; color:maroon; width: 250px;&quot;
|+ '''The Table Caption'''
| This is the table cell text
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''...but by enclosing it in styled preformatting tags...'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;border:none;background:transparent;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; width: 400px;&quot;&amp;gt;
The code block goes here
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

'''...it produces this: Note that the box width and the wrapping of ''long lines'' have been modified:'''
&lt;pre style=&quot; width: 400px;white-space: pre-wrap; font-family: courier new;&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--Pre-wrap wraps long lines; the rest preformatted.--&gt;
{| cellpadding=7px cellspacing=5px style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgray; font-style:italic; background: transparent; color:maroon; width: 250px;&quot;
|+ '''The Table Caption'''
| This is the table cell text
|}&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''The ''further'' addition of style rules like this...'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;border:none;background:transparent;white-space:pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; line-height:2em; border: 1px solid lightgray; background: lightyellow; color: black; width: 400px; font-family: courier new;&quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;!--Pre-wrap wraps long lines; the rest preformatted.--&gt;
{| cellpadding=7px cellspacing=5px style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgray; font-style:italic; background: transparent; color:maroon; width: 250px;&quot;
|+ '''The Table Caption'''
| This is the table cell text
|}
&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


'''...gives ''this'' version of preformatted text, with formats and long-line wrapping...'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; line-height:2em; border: 1px solid lightgray; background: lightyellow; color: black; width: 400px; font-family: courier new;&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--Pre-wrap wraps long lines; the rest preformatted.--&gt;
{| cellpadding=7px cellspacing=5px style=&quot;border:1px solid lightgray; font-style:italic; background: transparent; color:maroon; width: 250px;&quot;
|+ '''The Table Caption'''
| This is the table cell text
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;


Testing the above code block display by copying and pasting it works well.

===Top Sections===

These templates will remove any existing Table of Contents and then remake them in-line with the images.   To save work use the template '''Imageontop''', or '''Textontop''', unless like this example a links box is needed.   In that case use the discrete table code as follows; the two-image result is shown below.

This list contains a selection of ready-made flower image formats.   These make thumbnail images with a base dimension of 250 pixels, have a border on them and a caption.   They are located by default on the ''right'' of the page, though an extra option can be added to specify ''left'', ''right'',  or ''center''.

Copy individual image lines into the '''Sandbox''' or directly into your work to experiment with their formats.   Satisfy ''yourself'' as to the copyright conditions on the individual image pages when planning their use.   For an overview of how to use images, read  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Pictures/The_Quick_Course '''The Quick Course'''], and the other pages in the ''Editing Wikitext/Pictures'' series.

===Structures in Line===
----
Multiple structures can be placed in-line, but because some browsers differ, images should be kept clear of the middle position.   The following line-up works with all three of the Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Opera browsers, though even ''slight'' changes can spoil the rendering.   (IE6 lowers middle images; Firefox shifts centered galleries to the left).   The code can be found in the drop-down box.

'''Style Expression Spacing Rules for WIKITEXT'''
----
'''Main Points to Avoid'''

*Line breaks are ''not'' permitted within style expressions.
*Spaces are not permitted immediately ''before'' colons and semi-colons.

'''These have Latitude'''

*Space between the various table symbols and the word ''style'' is OK.
*Space around any ''equals'' symbol is OK.
*Space between the style rules and their ''outside'' parentheses is OK.
*Spaces ''after'' colons and semi-colons are OK.
*A semi-colon can be placed immediately ''after'' the last style rule.

'''In addition'''

*Compound values like '2px solid black' ''must'' be space-separated.
*Legacy styles ''must'' be separated from CSS style expressions with space.
*HTML ''element'' spacing is itself tolerant.  
*Wikitext tables can be indented for clarity.
----
----


'''Combining the two style rule methods:'''

It is possible to mix the attributes with CSS styles provided that they keep to their own local formats.
That is to say; nothing with an equals sign between the quotes, and no CSS rules outside
of them.   Note that the Wiki apostrophe codes and various HTML codes can still be used for cell and other text.  An example of mixed styles is shown below.

&lt;pre style=&quot;border:1px solid dimgray;background:white;&quot;&gt;
{| border=1 width=300px style=&quot;background:lightyellow;color:maroon;&quot;
| height=100px| ''First'' cell
| style=&quot;background:black;color:white;&quot; width=200px align=center|''Second'' cell
|}&lt;/pre&gt;;

== Uses, Limitations, and Options ==

===Uses===
----
'''Fancy2''' provides a colourful heading, which is ''not'' listed in the TOC. Use [[Template:Fancyh2]] for a TOC listing.  The underline does not extend across the page but only as far as the end of the text.


This template is called for use with:

{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fancy2|This is the First Bit | ; this is the second bit...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}


It does this:


{{fancy2|This is the First Bit | ; this is the second bit...}}

===Limitations===
----
There are limited formats in this version.

Use template '''Fancy3''' for a smaller font.


===Options===
----
;ff:   font family, (default, Lucida Handwriting)
;fw:   font weight, (default, bold)
;fc:   font color, (default, maroon)
;hfs:  heading font size, the first part of the heading, (default, 22pt)
;tfs:  tails font size, the second part of the heading, (default, 50% of that above)

;bgc:  text background color, (default, transparent)
;ta:   text alignment, (default, left)
;bb:   bottom border, the underline, (default, 10px solid lightsalmon)
;p:    padding, (default, 5px 5px 0 5px, for top, right, bottom, and left respectively)

===Uses===
----
'''Fancy3''' provides a colourful heading and is ''not'' listed in the TOC, (Table of Contents). For a TOC listing use [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Template:Fancyh3 '''fancyh3'''] instead.  The underline here applies only to the text area, unlike the h3 version which spans the page. 


This template is called for use with:

{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{fancy3|This is the First Bit | ; this is the second bit...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}


It does this:


{{Fancy3|This is the First Bit | ; this is the second bit...}}



===Limitations===
----
There are limited formats in this version.

Use template '''Fancy2''' for a bigger font.


===Options===
----
;ff:   font family, (default, Lucida Handwriting)

      <comment>/* Silesian alphabet */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lesson 1 - '''''Silesian alphabet and pronunciation''''' ==
It's really important to learn the material from this lesson very carefully. If you learn to pronounce the words incorrectly, you'll do it forever! So, let's start with the alphabet of the Silesian language. Each time I will add the [[w:Help:IPA|IPA signs]] so as to give you the exact pronunciation without recording it.
=== Silesian alphabet ===
{| 
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Aa'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Bb'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Cc'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ćć'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Čč'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Dd'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ee'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ff'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Gg'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Hh'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ii'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Jj'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Kk'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ll'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Mm'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Nn'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ńń'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Oo'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Pp'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Rr'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Řř'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ss'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Śś'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Šš'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Tt'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Uu'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ůů'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ww'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Yy'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Zz'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Źź'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Žž'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
There are also some digraphs in the Silesian language, which don't have a place in the standard alphabet.
&lt;center&gt;
{| 
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ch ch'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Dz dz'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Dź dź'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Dž dž'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Iu iu'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Uo uo'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Uů uů'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''Ůu ůu'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

All right, I'm sure that you don't even have any idea how to read these strange lines and carons above the letters. Carefully read the next chapters — vowels and consonants — and learn how to do that!

==== Digraphs ====

=== Notes ===

=== Stress ===
Usually, stress falls onto the prelast syllable, eg. '''Ame&lt;u&gt;ri&lt;/u&gt;ka''' (''America''). There are of course some exceptions. The nouns which end with '''-cyjo''', '''-syjo''', '''-zyjo''', '''-ńijo''' have two variants of accentuation, eg. the word '''informacyjo''' (''information'') can be said infor&lt;u&gt;ma&lt;/u&gt;cyjo or informa&lt;u&gt;cy&lt;/u&gt;jo. What's interesting, some words of Greek and Latin origin, of which the accentuation is irregular in Polish, is normal in Silesian, eg. '''matematyka''' (''mathematics'') in Polish would be mate&lt;u&gt;ma&lt;/u&gt;tyka, the Silesian people say it usually as matyma&lt;u&gt;ty&lt;/u&gt;ka.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Can i clarify the purpose of this page, since many of the existing topics appear to be trying to teach elementary chemistry, specifically the section on fluoride ions. Therefore is this page intended to serve as a reference for the analytical minded, or is it intended to teach the elementary principles behind each test, as i sense that could take a very long time --[[User:Varnis|Varnis]] ([[User talk:Varnis|talk]]) 21:47, 21 June 2008 (UTC)

== to the lay man ==

if you compare barium sulpahte and silver chloride look the same, likewise lots of people would not be sure if silver chloride is the only white precipitate that exists.
for example barium suplahte and calcium sulphate look very similar in a test tube with liquid.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Multiplication error ==

Dedekind multiplication is tricky. The definition for multiplication as stated currently doesn't work if both numbers are negative. Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_2&lt;/math&gt; both be the cut for the real number -2, which we'll assume has been constructed by other methods for now :). -2 * -2 = 4. Let's consider some number in our two Dedekind cuts. I like -10. &lt;math&gt;-10 \in \alpha_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-10 \in \alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;, so by your definition &lt;math&gt;100 \in \alpha_1 \cdot \alpha_2&lt;/math&gt;. However, 100 is firmly not in the Dedekind cut for 4.  --[[User:Shadytrees|Shadytrees]] ([[User talk:Shadytrees|talk]]) 02:47, 22 June 2008 (UTC)

Your of course correct.  I have made some change that attempts to be closer to the truth, but technically the multiplication as I defined it is still incorrect because this page defines cuts as open.  It may be easier to allow them to be open or closed, and define an equivalence relation.  I shall have to think on this a bit. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:31, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

==Naming==
It seems like a bad idea to call the set of cuts &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; before we prove that it satisfies the axioms we put forth for &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

==Blogging: Applying Information Literacy Concepts in the Secondary Classroom==

===Using new strategies to teach information literacy to the Google Generation: A rationale===

A 2008 study evaluating differences in information behavior between generations[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X X], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y Y], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_generation Google], revealed information gathering characteristics unique to the current crop of high school students. Some findings are unsurprising, such as the youngest generation's general acceptance for digital technology and comfort with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 Web 2.0] tools for social networking. Some results indicated a gap in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy information literacy], such as tendencies to disregard source credibility, bypass libraries, and assign the same value to expert and amateur sources. Most disturbingly, college freshman were found to lack general information literacy skills. Decreasing information literacy in the face of a changing digital information environment indicates more instruction on information literacy with digital formats is needed in the secondary classroom.&lt;ref&gt; Loertscher, D. (2008). What works with the Google generation? ''Teacher Librarian,'' 35(4), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using Web 2.0 tools in the classroom: A focus on blogs===

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University Michigan State University] faculty '''Nicole B. Ellison''' and '''Yuehua Wu''' found in a 2008 study that weblogs, or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogs blogs], can be an effective tool for enhancing course content and teaching information literacy. &lt;ref&gt; Ellison, N. &amp; Y. Wu. (2008). Blogging in the classroom: A preliminary exploration of student attitudes and impact on comprehension. ''Journal of Education Multimedia and Hypermedia,'' 17(1), 99-122. &lt;/ref&gt; Among their student sample, most students found reading blogs more helpful than their own critical analysis of a topic through a formal response paper. Furthermore, when asked to respond to a topic via a blog rather than a traditional paper, the vehicle for their response effected critical analysis very little, creating evenly mixed responses both in favor of traditional writing and blogging.&lt;ref&gt; Ellison, N. &amp; Y. Wu. (2008). &lt;/ref&gt;

===More benefits to blogging===

Blogging creates flexibility in the classroom. Teachers have choice in how to set up their blogs. They may choose to have each student create his or her own blog, or create a single blog for the class to which each student contributes. Likewise, teachers may have all students respond to the same or similar topics, or assign connected but unique topics and avoid repetitiveness. Secondly, blogging adds a collaborative environment to the classroom, allowing teachers from different content areas, librarians, and technology experts to work with students simultaneously. Teachers can expand the classroom even further by using the blog as a tool to address tangents and other &quot;teachable moments&quot; that often get sacrificed for time during the traditional 45- or 90-minute block. Lastly, blogs are a great addition to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_instruction differentiation] toolbox. They can individualize course content according to student interest, give shy students an opportunity to contribute to the class dialogue, and allow students to progress according to ability by continually revising until the product is correct, rather than aiming for a one-time grade. &lt;ref&gt;Glass, R. (2007). Incorporating blogs into the syllabus: Making their space a learning space. ''Journal of Educational Technology Systems,'' 36(2), 145-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A few considerations===

As a relatively new teaching tools, blogs will also create some challenges. For examples, researchers are still undecided as to how the digital environment impacts the quality of student work. In the Ellison study, students reported taking a less formal tone to their writing. This may be problematic if it means students taking the work less seriously, or it could indicate that students will exhibit a more authentic quality to their writing. &lt;ref&gt; Ellison, N. &amp; Y. Wu. (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Glass argues that blogging may enhance student thought and effort because blog's public nature incites competitiveness. &lt;ref&gt;Glass, R. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consideration is anonymity. Allowing students to keep their blogging personas private may encourage a freer expression of idea and, particularly when discussing sensitive or controversial topics, prevent the words of their youth from following students into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt; Ellison, N. &amp; Y. Wu. (2008). &lt;/ref&gt;

===The bottom line===

If implemented well, blogs can enhance curriculum and promote information literacy in the digital environment. '''Richard Glass''' offers a good example. In his study, students began enhancing blogs with images and other visual aids without being asked. Not only did this elevate the course discussion and add to the class's body of knowledge, but it also &quot;enhanced their skills at data manipulation and presentation&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;Glass, R. (2007). &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I speak no ''Nederlands'', but I needed a few words of it for [[:m:User:Jerzy/Template List|a project]], and found that the wikibook [[Dutch]] quickly met my very small needs.

I find myself tempted to make very small changes in the English instructions of that language course, where the excellent and fully understandable English is just slightly awkward. (For instance, the expression &quot;mother tongue speaker&quot; is perfectly clear in context, but 
: if I had chosen that phrase I would have hyphenated &quot;mother-tongue&quot; to make clear its role as an adjectivial phrase (or technically an attributive-noun phrase, I guess) modifying &quot;speaker&quot;, and
: I probably would have in any case chosen instead &quot;native speaker&quot; -- which may be ''more'' ambiguous   but to native speakers of English is so well established that it is probably the clearest way of stating the concept.

I suppose I'm being overly cautious, and shouldn't need any encouragement (after nearly 5 years at en: !); we'll see what happens.</text>

==A.1 What is Anarchism?==

Anarchism is a political theory which aims to create anarchy, ''&quot;the absence of a master, of a sovereign.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, P-J, What is Property: an inquiry into the principle of right and of government, William Reeves Bookseller Ltd., London, 1969. p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, anarchism is a political theory which aims to create a society within which individuals freely co-operate together as equals. As such anarchism opposes all forms of hierarchical control - be that control by the state or a capitalist - as harmful to the individual and their individuality as well as unnecessary.

In the words of anarchist L. Susan Brown:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;While the popular understanding of anarchism is of a violent, anti-State movement, anarchism is a much more subtle and nuanced tradition then a simple opposition to government power. Anarchists oppose the idea that power and domination are necessary for society, and instead advocate more co-operative, anti-hierarchical forms of social, political and economic organisation.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. Susan, The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism and
Anarchism, Black Rose, Montreal/New York, 1993. p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, &quot;anarchism&quot; and &quot;anarchy&quot; are undoubtedly the most misrepresented ideas in political theory. Generally, the words are used to mean &quot;chaos&quot; or &quot;without order,&quot; and so, by implication, anarchists desire social chaos and a return to the &quot;laws of the jungle.&quot;

This process of misrepresentation is not without historical parallel. For example, in countries which have considered government by one person (monarchy) necessary, the words &quot;republic&quot; or &quot;democracy&quot; have been used precisely like &quot;anarchy,&quot; to imply disorder and confusion. Those with a vested interest in preserving the status quo will obviously wish to imply that opposition to the current system cannot work in practice, and that a new form of society will only lead to chaos. Or, as Errico Malatesta expresses it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;since it was thought that government was necessary and that without government there could only be disorder and confusion, it was natural and logical that anarchy, which means absence of government, should sound like absence of order.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Malatesta, Errico, Anarchy, Freedom Press, London, 2001. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anarchists want to change this &quot;common-sense&quot; idea of &quot;anarchy,&quot; so people will see that government and other hierarchical social relationships are both harmful '''and''' unnecessary:

&quot;Change opinion, convince the public that government is not only unnecessary, but extremely harmful, and then the word anarchy, just because it means absence of government, will come to mean for everybody: natural order, unity of human needs and the interests of all, complete freedom within complete solidarity.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Malatesta, Errico, Anarchy, Freedom Press, London, 2001. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

This FAQ is part of the process of changing the commonly-held ideas regarding anarchism and the meaning of anarchy. But that is not all. As well as combating the distortions produced by the &quot;common-sense&quot; idea of &quot;anarchy&quot;, we also have to combat the distortions that anarchism and anarchists have been subjected to over the years by our political and social enemies. For, as Bartolomeo Vanzetti put it, anarchists are ''&quot;the radical of the radical -- the black cats, the terrors of many, of all the bigots, exploiters, charlatans, fakers and oppressors. Consequently we are also the more slandered, misrepresented, misunderstood and persecuted of all.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Sacco, Nicola and Vanzetti, Bartolomeo, The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti, Penguin Books,
New York, 1997. p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Vanzetti knew what he was talking about. He and his comrade Nicola Sacco were framed by the US state for a crime they did not commit and were, effectively, electrocuted for being foreign anarchists in 1927. So this FAQ will have to spend some time correcting the slanders and distortions that anarchists have been subjected to by the capitalist media, politicians, ideologues and bosses (not to mention the distortions by our erstwhile fellow radicals like liberals and Marxists). Hopefully once we are finished you will understand why those in power have spent so much time attacking anarchism -- it is the one idea which can effectively ensure liberty for all and end all systems based on a few having power over the many.

==A.1.1 What does &quot;anarchy&quot; mean?==

The word '''&quot;anarchy&quot;''' is from the Greek, prefix '''an''' (or '''a'''), meaning ''&quot;not,&quot;'' ''&quot;the want of,&quot;'' ''&quot;the absence of,&quot;'' or ''&quot;the lack of&quot;'', plus '''archos''', meaning ''&quot;a ruler,&quot;'' ''&quot;director&quot;'', ''&quot;chief,&quot;'' ''&quot;person in charge,&quot;'' or ''&quot;authority.&quot;'' Or, as Peter Kropotkin put it, Anarchy comes from the Greek words meaning ''&quot;contrary to authority.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter, Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings, Roger N. Baldwin (Ed.), Dover Press, New York, 2002.  p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Greek words '''anarchos''' and '''anarchia''' are often taken to mean '''&quot;having no government&quot;''' or '''&quot;being without a government,&quot;''' as can be seen, the strict, original meaning of anarchism was not simply '''&quot;no government.&quot;''' '''''&quot;An-archy&quot;''''' means ''&quot;without a ruler,&quot;'' or more generally, ''&quot;without authority,&quot;'' and it is in this sense that anarchists have continually used the word. For example, we find Kropotkin arguing that anarchism ''&quot;attacks not only capital, but also the main sources of the power of capitalism: law, authority, and the State.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter, Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings, Roger N. Baldwin (Ed.), Dover Press, New York, 2002.  p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchists, anarchy means ''&quot;not necessarily absence of order, as is generally supposed, but an absence of rule.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt; Tucker, Benjamin R., Instead of a Book, by a man too busy to write one: a fragmentary exposition of philosophical anarchism culled from the writings of Benj. R. Tucker, Haskell House Publishers, New York, 1969. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence David Weick's excellent summary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Anarchism can be understood as the generic social and political idea that expresses negation of all power, sovereignty, domination, and hierarchical division, and a will to their dissolution. . . Anarchism is therefore more than anti-statism . . . [even if] government (the state) . . . is, appropriately, the central focus of anarchist critique.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[Ehrlich, Howard J, Carol Ehrlich, David De Leon, Glenda Morris (eds.), Reinventing Anarchy: What are Anarchists thinking these days?, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London, 1979. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

For this reason, rather than being purely anti-government or anti-state, anarchism is primarily a movement against hierarchy. Why? Because hierarchy is the organisational structure that embodies authority. Since the state is the &quot;highest&quot; form of hierarchy, anarchists are, by definition, anti-state; but this is not a sufficient definition of anarchism. This means that real anarchists are opposed to all forms of hierarchical organisation, not only the state. In the words of Brian Morris:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;The term anarchy comes from the Greek, and essentially means 'no ruler.' Anarchists are people who reject all forms of government or coercive authority, all forms of hierarchy and domination. They are therefore opposed to what the Mexican anarchist Flores Magon called the 'sombre trinity' -- state, capital and the church. Anarchists are thus opposed to both capitalism and to the state, as well as to all forms of religious authority. But anarchists also seek to establish or bring about by varying means, a condition of anarchy, that is, a decentralised society without coercive institutions, a society organised through a federation of voluntary associations.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anthropology and Anarchism,&quot; pp. 35-41, Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed, no. 45, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reference to &quot;hierarchy&quot; in this context is a fairly recent development -- the &quot;classical&quot; anarchists such as Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin did use the word, but rarely (they usually preferred &quot;authority,&quot; which was used as short-hand for &quot;authoritarian&quot;). However, it's clear from their writings that theirs was a philosophy against hierarchy, against any inequality of power or privileges between individuals. Bakunin spoke of this when he attacked ''&quot;official&quot;'' authority but defended ''&quot;natural influence,&quot;'' and also when he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Do you want to make it impossible for anyone to oppress his fellow-man? Then make sure that no one shall possess power.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, G.P. Maximov (ed.), The Free Press, New York, 1953. p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

As Jeff Draughn notes, ''&quot;while it has always been a latent part of the 'revolutionary project,' only recently has this broader concept of anti-hierarchy arisen for more specific scrutiny. Nonetheless, the root of this is plainly visible in the Greek roots of the word 'anarchy.'&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Draughn, Jeff, Between Anarchism and Libertarianism: Defining a New Movement, available at [http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/between.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

We stress that this opposition to hierarchy is, for anarchists, not limited to just the state or government. It includes all authoritarian economic and social relationships as well as political ones, particularly those associated with capitalist property and wage labour. This can be seen from Proudhon's argument that ''&quot;'''Capital''' ... in the political field is analogous to '''government''' ... The economic idea of capitalism, the politics of government or of authority, and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas, linked in various ways. To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them ... What capital does to labour, and the State to liberty, the Church does to the spirit. This trinity of absolutism is as baneful in practice as it is in philosophy. The most effective means for oppressing the people would be simultaneously to enslave its body, its will and its reason.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Nettlau, Max, A Short History of Anarchism, Freedom Press, London, 1996. pp. 43-44].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we find Emma Goldman opposing capitalism as it meant ''&quot;that man [or woman] must sell his [or her] labour&quot;'' and, therefore, ''&quot;that his [or her] inclination and judgement are subordinated to the will of a master.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Red Emma Speaks, Alix Kates Shulman (Ed.), Wildwood House, London, 1979. p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years earlier Bakunin made the same point when he argued that under the current system ''&quot;the worker sells his person and his liberty for a given time&quot;'' to the capitalist in exchange for a wage. &lt;ref&gt;The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, G.P. Maximov (ed.), The Free Press, New York, 1953. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus &quot;anarchy&quot; means more than just &quot;no government,&quot; it means opposition to all forms of authoritarian organisation and hierarchy. In Kropotkin's words, ''&quot;the origin of the anarchist inception of society ... [lies in] the criticism ... of the hierarchical organisations and the authoritarian conceptions of society; and ... the analysis of the tendencies that are seen in the progressive movements of mankind.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter, Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings, Roger N. Baldwin (Ed.), Dover Press, New York, 2002. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; For Malatesta, anarchism ''&quot;was born in a moral revolt against social injustice&quot;'' and that the ''&quot;specific causes of social ills&quot;'' could be found in ''&quot;capitalistic property and the State.&quot;'' When the oppressed ''&quot;sought to overthrow both State and property - then it was that anarchism was born.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas, 3rd Edition, Vernon Richards (Ed.), Freedom Press, London, 1993. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus any attempt to assert that anarchy is purely anti-state is a misrepresentation of the word and the way it has been used by the anarchist movement. As Brian Morris argues, ''&quot;when one examines the writings of classical anarchists. . . as well as the character of anarchist movements. . . it is clearly evident that it has never had this limited vision [of just being against the state]. It has always challenged all forms of authority and exploitation, and has been equally critical of capitalism and religion as it has been of the state.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed, no. 45, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

Anarchy is not synonymous with chaos; nor do anarchists seek to create chaos or disorder. Instead, they wish to create a society based upon individual freedom and voluntary co-operation. In other words, order from the bottom up, not disorder imposed from the top down by authorities. Such a society would be a true anarchy, a society without rulers.

While we discuss what an anarchy could look like in section I, Noam Chomsky sums up the key aspect when he stated that in a truly free society ''&quot;any interaction among human beings that is more than personal -- meaning that takes institutional forms of one kind or another -- in community, or workplace, family, larger society, whatever it may be, should be under direct control of its participants. So that would mean workers' councils in industry, popular democracy in communities, interaction between them, free associations in larger groups, up to organisation of international society.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Anarchism Interview: Noam Chomsky interviewed by Ziga Vodovnik, available at: [http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=6805]&lt;/ref&gt; Society would no longer be divided into a hierarchy of bosses and workers, governors and governed. Rather, an anarchist society would be based on free association in participatory organisations and run from the bottom up. Anarchists, it should be noted, try to create as much of this society today, in their organisations, struggles and activities, as they can.

==A.1.2 What does &quot;anarchism&quot; mean?==

To quote Peter Kropotkin, Anarchism is ''&quot;the no-government system of socialism.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter, Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings, Roger N. Baldwin (Ed.), Dover Press, New York, 2002. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, ''&quot;the abolition of exploitation and oppression of man by man, that is the abolition of private property [i.e. capitalism] and government.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Errico Malatesta, &quot;Towards Anarchism&quot;, Man!, M. Graham (ed.), Cienfuegos Press, London, 1974. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism, therefore, is a political theory that aims to create a society which is without political, economic or social hierarchies. Anarchists maintain that anarchy, the absence of rulers, is a viable form of social system and so work for the maximisation of individual liberty and social equality. They see the goals of liberty and equality as mutually self-supporting. Or, in Bakunin's famous dictum: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;We are convinced that freedom without Socialism is privilege and injustice, and that Socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;The Political Philosophy of Bakunin, G.P. Maximov (ed.), The Free Press, New York, 1953. p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The history of human society proves this point. Liberty without equality is only liberty for the powerful, and equality without liberty is impossible and a justification for slavery. 

While there are many different types of anarchism (from individualist anarchism to communist-anarchism - see section A.3 for more details), there has always been two common positions at the core of all of them - opposition to government and opposition to capitalism. In the words of the individualist-anarchist Benjamin Tucker, anarchism insists ''&quot;on the abolition of the State and the abolition of usury; on no more government of man by man, and no more exploitation of man by man.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Eunice, Native American Anarchism: A Study of Left-Wing American Individualism, De Capo Press, New York, 1970. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; All anarchists view profit, interest and rent as '''usury''' (i.e. as exploitation) and so oppose them and the conditions that create them just as much as they oppose government and the State. 

More generally, in the words of L. Susan Brown, the ''&quot;unifying link&quot;'' within anarchism ''&quot;is a universal condemnation of hierarchy and domination and a willingness to fight for the freedom of the human individual.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. Susan, The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism and Anarchism, Black Rose, Montreal/New York, 1993. p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchists, a person cannot be free if they are subject to state or capitalist authority. As Voltairine de Cleyre summarised: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Anarchism ... teaches the possibility of a society in which the needs of life may be fully supplied for all, and in which the opportunities for complete development of mind and body shall be the heritage of all ... [It] teaches that the present unjust organisation of the production and distribution of wealth must finally be completely destroyed, and replaced by a system which will insure to each the liberty to work, without first seeking a master to whom he [or she] must surrender a tithe of his [or her] product, which will guarantee his liberty of access to the sources and means of production ... Out of the blindly submissive, it makes the discontented; out of the unconsciously dissatisfied, it makes the consciously dissatisfied ... Anarchism seeks to arouse the consciousness of oppression, the desire for a better society, and a sense of the necessity for unceasing warfare against capitalism and the State.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;[Anarchy! An Anthology of Emma Goldman's Mother Earth, pp. 23-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

So Anarchism is a political theory which advocates the creation of anarchy, a society based on the maxim of ''&quot;no rulers.&quot;'' To achieve this, ''&quot;[i]n common with all socialists, the anarchists hold that the private ownership of land, capital, and machinery has had its time; that it is condemned to disappear: and that all requisites for production must, and will, become the common property of society, and be managed in common by the producers of wealth. And ... they maintain that the ideal of the political organisation of society is a condition of things where the functions of government are reduced to minimum ... [and] that the ultimate aim of society is the reduction of the functions of government to nil - that is, to a society without government, to an-archy&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter, Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings, Roger N. Baldwin (Ed.), Dover Press, New York, 2002. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus anarchism is both positive and negative. It analyses and critiques current society while at the same time offering a vision of a potential new society - a society that fulfils certain human needs which the current one denies. These needs, at their most basic, are liberty, equality and solidarity. 

Anarchism unites critical analysis with hope, for, as Bakunin (in his pre-anarchist days) pointed out, ''&quot;the urge to destroy is a creative urge.&quot;'' One cannot build a better society without understanding what is wrong with the present one. 

However, it must be stressed that anarchism is more than just a means of analysis or a vision of a better society. It is also rooted in struggle, the struggle of the oppressed for their freedom. In other words, it provides a means of achieving a new system based on the needs of people, not power, and which places the planet before profit. To quote Scottish anarchist Stuart Christie: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;Anarchism is a movement for human freedom. It is concrete, democratic and egalitarian ... Anarchism began - and remains - a direct challenge by the underprivileged to their oppression and exploitation. It opposes both the insidious growth of state power and the pernicious ethos of possessive individualism, which, together or separately, ultimately serve only the interests of the few at the expense of the rest.''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''Anarchism is both a theory and practice of life. Philosophically, it aims for the maximum accord between the individual, society and nature. Practically, it aims for us to organise and live our lives in such a way as to make politicians, governments, states and their officials superfluous. In an anarchist society, mutually respectful sovereign individuals would be organised in non-coercive relationships within naturally defined communities in which the means of production and distribution are held in common.''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''Anarchists are not dreamers obsessed with abstract principles and theoretical constructs ... Anarchists are well aware that a perfect society cannot be won tomorrow. Indeed, the struggle lasts forever! However, it is the vision that provides the spur to struggle against things as they are, and for things that might be ...''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''Ultimately, only struggle determines outcome, and progress towards a more meaningful community must begin with the will to resist every form of injustice. In general terms, this means challenging all exploitation and defying the legitimacy of all coercive authority. If anarchists have one article of unshakeable faith, it is that, once the habit of deferring to politicians or ideologues is lost, and that of resistance to domination and exploitation acquired, then ordinary people have a capacity to organise every aspect of their lives in their own interests, anywhere and at any time, both freely and fairly.''
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''Anarchists do not stand aside from popular struggle, nor do they attempt to dominate it. They seek to contribute practically whatever they can, and also to assist within it the highest possible levels of both individual self-development and of group solidarity. It is possible to recognise anarchist ideas concerning voluntary relationships, egalitarian participation in decision-making processes, mutual aid and a related critique of all forms of domination in philosophical, social and revolutionary movements in all times and places.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;My Granny made me an Anarchist (The Christie File part 1, 1946-1964), Christie Books, Hastings, 2002. pp. 162-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anarchism, anarchists argue, is simply the theoretical expression of our capacity to organise ourselves and run society without bosses or politicians. It allows working class and other oppressed people to become conscious of our power as a class, defend our immediate interests, and fight to revolutionise society as a whole. Only by doing this can we create a society fit for human beings to live in. 

It is no abstract philosophy. Anarchist ideas are put into practice everyday. Wherever oppressed people stand up for their rights, take action to defend their freedom, practice solidarity and co- operation, fight against oppression, organise themselves without leaders and bosses, the spirit of anarchism lives. Anarchists simply seek to strengthen these libertarian tendencies and bring them to their full fruition. As we discuss in later sections, anarchists apply their ideas in many ways within capitalism in order to change it for the better until such time as we get rid of it completely. The volume of this book discusses what we aim to replace it with, i.e. what anarchism aims for.

      <comment>/* Poise */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">All dance can be interpreted as being a language or expression of yourself therefore it is similar to a language. There is certain words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs and even books that can be written. That will be interpreted by each audience member in a different way yet keeping you're interpretation in mind and following you're every move.

If it's ballet, modern, contemporary, ballroom or latin dance there is certain basic steps and variations that build up the dance to the form you would see and enjoy on stage or on the dance floor.

Here is a few tips to bring you're messages accross better:

== Poise ==

 Poise is To hang in equilibrium; to be balanced or suspended; hence,
 to be in suspense or doubt. [Websters 1913]

 Poise is a dignified and self-confident manner; graceful composure
 and tact in handling difficult social situations. [PJC]

This is important in latin dancing to have an erect manner and a composure and an air of confidence. This translates into how assertive you are in bringing over you're message and how believable it will be. Also it makes you're dancing more beautiful.

Here are some things you can look at to improve your poise.

== Head ==

Head up straight not looking down at the floor. In most latin dances you will be looking at your partner in the basic figures. There is specific places you have to look to make your story come over more convincing. The human is very used to looking at faces and eyes. When you are looking down at your feet or where you are not supposed to look it will be picked up immediately by the bystanders. 

The second part of this equation is that your head is heavy and as such when looking down it not only looks ugly it also throws you off balance when you try to make turns. This make the steps more difficult to dance.

Another less important part of this is that especially, beginner ladies, look at the feet and try to follow, this is not only next to impossible to do but also causes the lady to be a bit out of time. This also causes the lady to miss the lead on her back or the body lead from the man. Look only at the feet when learning the step and the moment you can do the step look up at you're partner. Remember habits you learn while practicing is habits you will use on the dance floor later on.

'''Learn to spot''' -  Spotting is when you keep you're head stationary looking at a spot and when you can not look at that spot anymore move you're head in a fast and controlled way around or to a new position. This is primarily used in turn where the lady would for example look at a man for as long as possible while turning and at the last possible moment move her head around and look at him again. Except for the obvious benefits in balance, it allows you to do many turns without getting disoriented. It looks better and make you're movements look sharper. A turn done at exactly the same speed looks considerably faster when the person is spotting than when they are just turning.

== Back, neck and shoulders ==

In latin dancing the back and neck is straight as possible with the pelvis tilted. When standing against a wall you're back should be touching all the way down. This causes you're abdominal muscles to contract this is exactly what should happen. The whole upper body should be kept upright without pushing out the chest. The arms are round like holding a barrel and the is some distance between the partners even in the closed hold. The shoulders must be kept relaxed at all times not sagging but not pulled up either. A easy way to remember is the same feeling when you put on jacket over the shoulders.

An easy thing for beginners to remember is that when you feel that you are pulling up you are probably pushing back instead of up. Make sure you're ears is above you ankles when standing up straight. The wall exercise above is a good way to get the feeling. I myself choose a spot above my head on the ceiling and then extend my head towards that bringing my back with it.

=== Exercise ===
A good exercise to try is:

* Place you're left hand on your bum and your right hand just below you belly button. 
* Now push you're bum forward while at the same time tilting you're pelvis forward and pushing you're right hand to the back.
* Now released the left hand on your bum and place it just above your belly button. Push you're hands together contracting your abdominal musles.
* Now release your right hand and place it above your left hand move your hands apart. 


You should feel that you're abdominal musles are contracted and you back straight. Not extend you're neck upwards and you have the correct position for latin dancing.

== Arms and hands ==

The arms and hands help interpret the character of the dance. The man and the womans arms and hand differ slightly basically the mans arms and hands are generally straighter and less complex while the woman would use a more feminine round and complex hand. 

The arms are generally used to complete a variation and make it look bigger. A big thing to remember even if there is no space think about what you would do with your arms. Just having the arms flopping about looks pretty bad. Each dance have a definite character and arms can be used in different ways to help interpret the dance.

== Feet and legs ==

Like the arms the legs and feet are used differently in the different dances. The most important thing to remember is that the movement of the hips and body starts at the feet. The foot is placed in the inside of the ball of the foot when move sideways or forward and back for Jive, Cha-cha-cha and Rumba. In the paso there is quite a few variations where this rules does not apply.

Another general principle in latin dancing is that quick steps are generally smaller than slow steps so for example the cha-cha is small while the 123 of the cha-cha is quite large steps.
 

== Dress and shoes ==

Although there is a difference of opinion on this I suggest you dress appropriately for your dancing lesson. When you dress sexy you feel sexy when you wear latin dancing shoes you feel and move like a latin dancer. If you plan to dance more than a couple of months. (Hopefully for the rest of you're life). Invest in a good pair of latin shoes both for the man and the lady but as a beginner the following guidelines will help.

For '''Men''' I suggest a light formal or semi formal shoe. Heavy boots do not lend themselves to latin dancing. Rubber soled sports shoes do not turn easily on a well maintained dance floor. 

For the '''Lady''' I suggest a high healed sandal of shoe that holds the ankle. A loose fitting shoe do not allow proper movement and balance. Rubber soled sports shoes do not turn easily on well maintained dance floors.

==A.1.3 Why is anarchism also called libertarian socialism?==

Many anarchists, seeing the negative nature of the definition of ''&quot;anarchism,&quot;'' have used other terms to emphasise the inherently positive and constructive aspect of their ideas. The most common terms used are ''&quot;free socialism,&quot;'' ''&quot;free communism,&quot;'' ''&quot;libertarian socialism,&quot;'' and ''&quot;libertarian communism.&quot;'' For anarchists, libertarian socialism, libertarian communism, and anarchism are virtually interchangeable. As Vanzetti put it: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;After all we are socialists as the social-democrats, the socialists, the communists, and the I.W.W. are all Socialists. The difference - the fundamental one - between us and all the other is that they are authoritarian while we are libertarian; they believe in a State or Government of their own; we believe in no State or Government.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Sacco, Nicola and Vanzetti, Bartolomeo, The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti, Penguin Books, New York, 1997. p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But is this correct? Considering definitions from the '''American Heritage Dictionary''', we find: 

 '''LIBERTARIAN:''' one who believes in freedom of action and thought; one who believes in free will. 

 '''SOCIALISM:''' a social system in which the producers possess both political power and the means of producing and distributing goods. 

Just taking those two first definitions and fusing them yields:

 '''LIBERTARIAN SOCIALISM:''' a social system which believes in freedom of action and thought and free will, in which the producers possess both
 political power and the means of producing and distributing goods. 

(Although we must add that our usual comments on the lack of political sophistication of dictionaries still holds. We only use these definitions to show that &quot;libertarian&quot; does not imply &quot;free market&quot; capitalism nor &quot;socialism&quot; state ownership. Other dictionaries, obviously, will have different definitions - particularly for socialism. Those wanting to debate dictionary definitions are free to pursue this unending and politically useless hobby but we will not).

However, due to the creation of the Libertarian Party in the USA, many people now consider the idea of ''&quot;libertarian socialism&quot;'' to be a contradiction in terms. Indeed, many &quot;Libertarians&quot; think anarchists are just attempting to associate the &quot;anti-libertarian&quot; ideas of &quot;socialism&quot; (as Libertarians conceive it) with Libertarian ideology in order to make those &quot;socialist&quot; ideas more &quot;acceptable&quot; - in other words, trying to steal the &quot;libertarian&quot; label from its rightful possessors.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Anarchists have been using the term &quot;libertarian&quot; to describe themselves and their ideas since the 1850's. According to anarchist historian Max Nettlau, the revolutionary anarchist Joseph Dejacque published '''Le Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social''' in New York between 1858 and 1861 while the use of the term &quot;libertarian communism&quot; dates from November, 1880 when a French anarchist congress adopted it. &lt;ref&gt;Nettlau, Max, A Short History of Anarchism, Freedom Press, London, 1996. p. 75 and p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term &quot;Libertarian&quot; by anarchists became more popular from the 1890s onward after it was used in France in an attempt to get round anti-anarchist laws and to avoid the negative associations of the word &quot;anarchy&quot; in the popular mind (Sébastien Faure and Louise Michel published the paper '''Le Libertaire - The Libertarian -''' in France in 1895, for example). Since then, particularly outside America, it has '''always''' been associated with anarchist ideas and movements. Taking a more recent example, in the USA, anarchists organised '''''&quot;The Libertarian League&quot;''''' in July 1954, which had staunch anarcho-syndicalist principles and lasted until 1965. The US-based &quot;Libertarian&quot; Party, on the other hand has only existed since the early 1970's, well over 100 years after anarchists first used the term to describe their political ideas (and 90 years after the expression &quot;libertarian communism&quot; was first adopted). It is that party, not the anarchists, who have &quot;stolen&quot; the word. Later, in Section B, we will discuss why the idea of a &quot;libertarian&quot; capitalism (as desired by the Libertarian Party) is a contradiction in terms.

As we will also explain in later sections, only a libertarian-socialist system of ownership can maximise individual freedom. Needless to say, state ownership - what is commonly '''called''' - is, for anarchists, not socialism at all. In fact, as we will elaborate later in this book, state &quot;socialism&quot; is just a form of capitalism, with no socialist content whatever. As Rudolf Rocker noted, for anarchists, socialism is ''&quot;not a simple question of a full belly, but a question of culture that would have to enlist the sense of personality and the free initiative of the individual; without freedom it would lead only to a dismal state capitalism which would sacrifice all individual thought and feeling to a fictitious collective interest.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;The London Years, Five Leaves Publications/AK Press, Nottingham/Oakland, 2005. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the anarchist pedigree of the word &quot;libertarian,&quot; few anarchists are happy to see it stolen by an ideology which shares little with our ideas. In the United States, as Murray Bookchin noted, the ''&quot;term 'libertarian' itself, to be sure, raises a problem, notably, the specious identification of an anti-authoritarian ideology with a straggling movement for 'pure capitalism' and 'free trade.' This movement never created the word: it appropriated it from the anarchist movement of the [nineteenth] century. And it should be recovered by those anti-authoritarians ... who try to speak for dominated people as a whole, not for personal egotists who identify freedom with entrepreneurship and profit.&quot;'' Thus anarchists in America should ''&quot;restore in practice a tradition that has been denatured by&quot;'' the free-market right. &lt;ref&gt;The Modern Crisis, New Society Publishers, Philadelphia, 1986. pp. 154-5.&lt;/ref&gt; And as we do that, we will continue to call our ideas libertarian socialism.

==A.1.4 Are anarchists socialists?==

Yes. All branches of anarchism are opposed to capitalism. This is because capitalism is based upon oppression and exploitation (see sections B and C). Anarchists reject the ''&quot;notion that men cannot work together unless they have a driving-master to take a percentage of their product&quot;'' and think that in an anarchist society ''&quot;the real workmen will make their own regulations, decide when and where and how things shall be done.&quot;'' By so doing workers would free themselves ''&quot;from the terrible bondage of capitalism.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Voltairine de Cleyre, ''&quot;Anarchism&quot;'', '''Exquisite Rebel''', p. 75 and p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; 

(We must stress here that anarchists are opposed to '''all''' economic forms which are based on domination and exploitation, including feudalism, Soviet-style &quot;socialism&quot; -- better called &quot;state capitalism&quot; --, slavery and so on. We concentrate on capitalism because that is what is dominating the world just now). 

Individualists like Benjamin Tucker along with social anarchists like Proudhon and Bakunin proclaimed themselves '''''&quot;socialists.&quot;''''' They did so because, as Kropotkin put it in his classic essay ''&quot;Modern Science and Anarchism,&quot;'' ''&quot;[s]o long as Socialism was understood in its wide, generic, and true sense -- as an effort to '''abolish''' the exploitation of Labour by Capital -- the Anarchists were marching hand-in-hands with the Socialists of that time.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;'''Evolution and Environment''', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Or, in Tucker's words, ''&quot;the bottom claim of Socialism [is] that labour should be put in possession of its own,&quot;'' a claim that both ''&quot;the two schools of Socialistic thought . . . State Socialism and Anarchism&quot;'' agreed upon. &lt;ref&gt;'''The Anarchist Reader''', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the word ''&quot;socialist&quot;'' was originally defined to include ''&quot;all those who believed in the individual's right to possess what he or she produced.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Lance Klafta, ''&quot;Ayn Rand and the Perversion of Libertarianism,&quot;'' in '''Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed''', no. 34&lt;/ref&gt; This opposition to exploitation (or usury) is shared by all true anarchists and places them under the socialist banner. 

For most socialists, ''&quot;the only guarantee not to be robbed of the fruits of your labour is to possess the instruments of labour.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Peter Kropotkin, '''The Conquest of Bread''', p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason Proudhon, for example, supported workers' co-operatives, where ''&quot;every individual employed in the association . . . has an undivided share in the property of the company&quot;'' because by ''&quot;participation in losses and gains . . . the collective force [i.e. surplus] ceases to be a source of profits for a small number of managers: it becomes the property of all workers.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;'''The General Idea of the Revolution''', p. 222 and p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in addition to desiring the end of exploitation of labour by capital, true socialists also desire a society within which the producers own and control the means of production (including, it should be stressed, those workplaces which supply services). The means by which the producers will do this is a moot point in anarchist and other socialist circles, but the desire remains a common one. Anarchists favour direct workers' control and either ownership by workers' associations or by the commune section A.3 on the different types of anarchists). 

Moreover, anarchists also reject capitalism for being authoritarian '''as well as''' exploitative. Under capitalism, workers do not govern themselves during the production process nor have control over the product of their labour. Such a situation is hardly based on equal freedom for all, nor can it be non-exploitative, and is so opposed by anarchists. This perspective can best be found in the work of Proudhon's (who inspired both Tucker and Bakunin) where he argues that anarchism would see ''&quot;[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation stopped everywhere [and] the wage system abolished&quot;'' for ''&quot;either the workman. . . will be simply the employee of the proprietor-capitalist-promoter; or he will participate . . . In the first case the workman is subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience. . . In the second case he resumes his dignity as a man and citizen. . . he forms part of the producing organisation, of which he was before but the slave . . . we need not hesitate, for we have no choice. . . it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers . . . because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two. . . castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society.&quot;'' ['''Op. Cit.''', p. 233 and pp. 215-216] 

Therefore '''all''' anarchists are anti-capitalist (''&quot;If labour owned the wealth it produced, there would be no capitalism&quot;'' [Alexander Berkman, '''What is Anarchism?''', p. 44]). Benjamin Tucker, for example -- the anarchist most influenced by liberalism (as we will discuss later) -- called his ideas ''&quot;Anarchistic-Socialism&quot;'' and denounced capitalism as a system based upon ''&quot;the usurer, the receiver of interest, rent and profit.&quot;'' Tucker held that in an anarchist, non-capitalist, free-market society, capitalists will become redundant and exploitation of labour by capital would cease, since ''&quot;labour. . . will. . . secure its natural wage, its entire product.&quot;'' ['''The Individualist Anarchists''', p. 82 and p. 85] Such an economy will be based on mutual banking and the free exchange of products between co-operatives, artisans and peasants. For Tucker, and other Individualist anarchists, capitalism is not a true free market, being marked by various laws and monopolies which ensure that capitalists have the advantage over working people, so ensuring the latter's exploitation via profit, interest and rent section G for a fuller discussion). Even Max Stirner, the arch-egoist, had nothing but scorn for capitalist society and its various &quot;spooks,&quot; which for him meant ideas that are treated as sacred or religious, such as private property, competition, division of labour, and so forth. 

So anarchists consider themselves as socialists, but socialists of a specific kind -- '''''libertarian socialists'''''. As the individualist anarchist Joseph A. Labadie puts it (echoing both Tucker and Bakunin): 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;It is said that Anarchism is not socialism. This is a mistake. Anarchism is voluntary Socialism. There are two kinds of Socialism, archistic and anarchistic, authoritarian and libertarian, state and free. Indeed, every proposition for social betterment is either to increase or decrease the powers of external wills and forces over the individual. As they increase they are archistic; as they decrease they are anarchistic.&quot;'' ['''Anarchism: What It Is and What It Is Not'''] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Labadie stated on many occasions that ''&quot;all anarchists are socialists, but not all socialists are anarchists.&quot;'' Therefore, Daniel Guerin's comment that ''&quot;Anarchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man&quot;'' is echoed throughout the history of the anarchist movement, be it the social or individualist wings. ['''Anarchism''', p. 12] Indeed, the Haymarket Martyr Adolph Fischer used almost exactly the same words as Labadie to express the same fact -- ''&quot;every anarchist is a socialist, but every socialist is not necessarily an anarchist&quot;'' -- while acknowledging that the movement was ''&quot;divided into two factions; the communistic anarchists and the Proudhon or middle-class anarchists.&quot;'' ['''The Autobiographies of the Haymarket Martyrs''', p. 81] 

So while social and individualist anarchists do disagree on many issues -- for example, whether a true, that is non-capitalist, free market would be the best means of maximising liberty -- they agree that capitalism is to be opposed as exploitative and oppressive and that an anarchist society must, by definition, be based on associated, not wage, labour. Only associated labour will ''&quot;decrease the powers of external wills and forces over the individual&quot;'' during working hours and such self-management of work by those who do it is the core ideal of real socialism. This perspective can be seen when Joseph Labadie argued that the trade union was ''&quot;the exemplification of gaining freedom by association&quot;'' and that ''&quot;[w]ithout his union, the workman is much more the slave of his employer than he is with it.&quot;'' ['''Different Phases of the Labour Question'''] 

However, the meanings of words change over time. Today &quot;socialism&quot; almost always refers to '''state''' socialism, a system that all anarchists have opposed as a denial of freedom and genuine socialist ideals. All anarchists would agree with Noam Chomsky's statement on this issue: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;If the left is understood to include 'Bolshevism,' then I would flatly dissociate myself from the left. Lenin was one of the greatest enemies of socialism.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;'''Marxism, Anarchism, and Alternative Futures''', p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anarchism developed in constant opposition to the ideas of Marxism, social democracy and Leninism. Long before Lenin rose to power, Mikhail Bakunin warned the followers of Marx against the ''&quot;Red bureaucracy&quot;'' that would institute ''&quot;the worst of all despotic governments&quot;'' if Marx's state-socialist ideas were ever implemented. Indeed, the works of Stirner, Proudhon and especially Bakunin all predict the horror of state Socialism with great accuracy. In addition, the anarchists were among the first and most vocal critics and opposition to the Bolshevik regime in Russia. 

Nevertheless, being socialists, anarchists do share '''some''' ideas with '''some''' Marxists (though none with Leninists). Both Bakunin and Tucker accepted Marx's analysis and critique of capitalism as well as his labour theory of value (see section C). Marx himself was heavily influenced by Max Stirner's book '''The Ego and Its Own''', which contains a brilliant critique of what Marx called &quot;vulgar&quot; communism as well as state socialism. There have also been elements of the Marxist movement holding views very similar to social anarchism (particularly the anarcho-syndicalist branch of social anarchism) -- for example, Anton Pannekoek, Rosa Luxembourg, Paul Mattick and others, who are very far from Lenin. Karl Korsch and others wrote sympathetically of the anarchist revolution in Spain. There are many continuities from Marx to Lenin, but there are also continuities from Marx to more libertarian Marxists, who were harshly critical of Lenin and Bolshevism and whose ideas approximate anarchism's desire for the free association of equals. 

Therefore anarchism is basically a form of socialism, one that stands in direct opposition to what is usually defined as &quot;socialism&quot; (i.e. state ownership and control). Instead of &quot;central planning,&quot; which many people associate with the word &quot;socialism,&quot; anarchists advocate free association and co-operation between individuals, workplaces and communities and so oppose &quot;state&quot; socialism as a form of state capitalism in which ''&quot;[e]very man [and woman] will be a wage-receiver, and the State the only wage payer.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tucker, '''The Individualist Anarchists''', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Thus anarchists reject Marxism (what most people think of as &quot;socialism&quot;) as just ''&quot;[t]he idea of the State as Capitalist, to which the Social-Democratic fraction of the great Socialist Party is now trying to reduce Socialism.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Peter Kropotkin, '''The Great French Revolution''', vol. 1, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The anarchist objection to the identification of Marxism, &quot;central planning&quot; and State Socialism/Capitalism with socialism will be discussed in section H. 

It is because of these differences with state socialists, and to reduce confusion, most anarchists just call themselves &quot;anarchists,&quot; as it is taken for granted that anarchists are socialists. However, with the rise of the so-called &quot;libertarian&quot; right in the USA, some pro-capitalists have taken to calling themselves &quot;anarchists&quot; and that is why we have laboured the point somewhat here. Historically, and logically, anarchism implies anti-capitalism, i.e. socialism, which is something, we stress, that all anarchists have agreed upon (for a fuller discuss of why &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalism is not anarchist see section F).

==A.1.5 Where does anarchism come from?==

Where does anarchism come from? We can do no better than quote '''The Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists''' produced by participants of the Makhnovist movement in the Russian Revolution (see Section A.5.4). They point out that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''&quot;The class struggle created by the enslavement of workers and their aspirations to liberty gave birth, in the oppression, to the idea of anarchism: the idea of the total negation of a social system based on the principles of classes and the State, and its replacement by a free non-statist society of workers under self-management.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

So anarchism does not derive from the abstract reflections of an intellectual or a philosopher, but from the direct struggle of workers against capitalism, from the needs and necessities of the workers, from their aspirations to liberty and equality, aspirations which become particularly alive in the best heroic period of the life and struggle of the working masses. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;'' &quot;The outstanding anarchist thinkers, Bakunin, Kropotkin and others, did not invent the idea of anarchism, but, having discovered it in the masses, simply helped by the strength of their thought and knowledge to specify and spread it.&quot;'' [pp. 15-16] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like the anarchist movement in general, the Makhnovists were a mass movement of working class people resisting the forces of authority, both Red (Communist) and White (Tsarist/Capitalist) in the Ukraine from 1917 to 1921. As Peter Marshall notes ''&quot;anarchism . . . has traditionally found its chief supporters amongst workers and peasants.&quot;'' ['''Demanding the Impossible''', p. 652] 

Anarchism was created in, and by, the struggle of the oppressed for freedom. For Kropotkin, for example, ''&quot;Anarchism . . . originated in everyday struggles&quot;'' and ''&quot;the Anarchist movement was renewed each time it received an impression from some great practical lesson: it derived its origin from the teachings of life itself.&quot;'' ['''Evolution and Environment''', p. 58 and p. 57] For Proudhon, ''&quot;the proof&quot;'' of his mutualist ideas lay in the ''&quot;current practice, revolutionary practice&quot;'' of ''&quot;those labour associations . . . which have spontaneously . . . been formed in Paris and Lyon . . . [show that the] organisation of credit and organisation of labour amount to one and the same.&quot;'' ['''No Gods, No Masters''', vol. 1, pp. 59-60] Indeed, as one historian argues, there was ''&quot;close similarity between the associational ideal of Proudhon . . . and the program of the Lyon Mutualists&quot;'' and that there was ''&quot;a remarkable convergence [between the ideas], and it is likely that Proudhon was able to articulate his positive program more coherently because of the example of the silk workers of Lyon. The socialist ideal that he championed was already being realised, to a certain extent, by such workers.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;K. Steven Vincent, '''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism''', p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus anarchism comes from the fight for liberty and our desires to lead a fully human life, one in which we have time to live, to love and to play. It was not created by a few people divorced from life, in ivory towers looking down upon society and making judgements upon it based on their notions of what is right and wrong. Rather, it was a product of working class struggle and resistance to authority, oppression and exploitation. As Albert Meltzer put it: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''&quot;There were never theoreticians of Anarchism as such, though it produced a number of theoreticians who discussed aspects of its philosophy. Anarchism has remained a creed that has been worked out in action rather than as the putting into practice of an intellectual idea. Very often, a bourgeois writer comes along and writes down what has already been worked out in practice by workers and peasants; he [or she] is attributed by bourgeois historians as being a leader, and by successive bourgeois writers (citing the bourgeois historians) as being one more case that proves the working class relies on bourgeois leadership.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;'''Anarchism: Arguments for and against''', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Kropotkin's eyes, ''&quot;Anarchism had its origins in the same creative, constructive activity of the masses which has worked out in times past all the social institutions of mankind -- and in the revolts . . . against the representatives of force, external to these social institutions, who had laid their hands on these institutions and used them for their own advantage.&quot;'' More recently, ''&quot;Anarchy was brought forth by the same critical and revolutionary protest which gave birth to Socialism in general.&quot;'' Anarchism, unlike other forms of socialism, ''&quot;lifted its sacrilegious arm, not only against Capitalism, but also against these pillars of Capitalism: Law, Authority, and the State.&quot;'' All anarchist writers did was to ''&quot;work out a general expression of [anarchism's] principles, and the theoretical and scientific basis of its teachings&quot;'' derived from the experiences of working class people in struggle as well as analysing the evolutionary tendencies of society in general. ['''Op. Cit.''', p. 19 and p. 57] 

However, anarchistic tendencies and organisations in society have existed long before Proudhon put pen to paper in 1840 and declared himself an anarchist. While anarchism, as a specific political theory, was born with the rise of capitalism (Anarchism ''&quot;emerged at the end of the eighteenth century . . .[and] took up the dual challenge of overthrowing both Capital and the State.&quot;'' [Peter Marshall, '''Op. Cit.''', p. 4]) anarchist writers have analysed history for libertarian tendencies. Kropotkin argued, for example, that ''&quot;from all times there have been Anarchists and Statists.&quot;'' ['''Op. Cit.''', p. 16] In '''Mutual Aid''' (and elsewhere) Kropotkin analysed the libertarian aspects of previous societies and noted those that successfully implemented (to some degree) anarchist organisation or aspects of anarchism. He recognised this tendency of actual examples of anarchistic ideas to predate the creation of the &quot;official&quot; anarchist movement and argued that: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''&quot;From the remotest, stone-age antiquity, men [and women] have realised the evils that resulted from letting some of them acquire personal authority. . . Consequently they developed in the primitive clan, the village community, the medieval guild . . . and finally in the free medieval city, such institutions as enabled them to resist the encroachments upon their life and fortunes both of those strangers who conquered them, and those clansmen of their own who endeavoured to establish their personal authority.&quot;'' ['''Anarchism''', pp. 158-9] &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kropotkin placed the struggle of working class people (from which modern anarchism sprung) on par with these older forms of popular organisation. He argued that ''&quot;the labour combinations. . . were an outcome of the same popular resistance to the growing power of the few -- the capitalists in this case&quot;'' as were the clan, the village community and so on, as were ''&quot;the strikingly independent, freely federated activity of the 'Sections' of Paris and all great cities and many small 'Communes' during the French Revolution&quot;'' in 1793. ['''Op. Cit.''', p. 159] 

Thus, while anarchism as a political theory is an expression of working class struggle and self-activity against capitalism and the modern state, the ideas of anarchism have continually expressed themselves in action throughout human existence. Many indigenous peoples in North America and elsewhere, for example, practised anarchism for thousands of years before anarchism as a specific political theory existed. Similarly, anarchistic tendencies and organisations have existed in every major revolution -- the New England Town Meetings during the American Revolution, the Parisian 'Sections' during the French Revolution, the workers' councils and factory committees during the Russian Revolution to name just a few examples (see Murray Bookchin's '''The Third Revolution''' for details). This is to be expected if anarchism is, as we argue, a product of resistance to authority then any society with authorities will provoke resistance to them and generate anarchistic tendencies (and, of course, any societies without authorities cannot help but being anarchistic). 

In other words, anarchism is an expression of the struggle against oppression and exploitation, a generalisation of working people's experiences and analyses of what is wrong with the current system and an expression of our hopes and dreams for a better future. This struggle existed before it was called anarchism, but the historic anarchist movement (i.e. groups of people calling their ideas anarchism and aiming for an anarchist society) is essentially a product of working class struggle against capitalism and the state, against oppression and exploitation, and '''for''' a free society of free and equal individuals.

==A.2.1 What is the essence of anarchism?==

As we have seen, ''&quot;an-archy&quot;'' implies ''&quot;without rulers&quot;'' or ''&quot;without (hierarchical) authority.&quot;'' Anarchists are not against &quot;authorities&quot; in the sense of experts who are particularly knowledgeable, skilful, or wise, though they believe that such authorities should have no power to force others to follow their recommendations (see  section B.1 for more on this distinction). In a nutshell, then, anarchism is anti-authoritarianism.

Anarchists are anti-authoritarians because they believe that no human being should dominate another. Anarchists, in L. Susan Brown's words, &quot;believe in the inherent dignity and worth of the human individual.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Individualism, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Domination is inherently degrading and demeaning, since it submerges the will and judgement of the dominated to the will and judgement of the dominators, thus destroying the dignity and self-respect that comes only from personal autonomy. Moreover, domination makes possible and generally leads to exploitation, which is the root of inequality, poverty, and social breakdown.

In other words, then, the essence of anarchism (to express it positively) is free co-operation between equals to maximise their liberty and individuality.

Co-operation between equals is the key to anti-authoritarianism. By co-operation we can develop and protect our own intrinsic value as unique individuals as well as enriching our lives and liberty for ''&quot;[n]o individual can recognise his own humanity, and consequently realise it in his lifetime, if not by recognising it in others and co-operating in its realisation for others . . . My freedom is the freedom of all since I am not truly free in thought and in fact, except when my freedom and my rights are confirmed and approved in the freedom and rights of all men [and women] who are my equals.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;Michael Bakunin, quoted by Errico Malatesta, Anarchy, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

While being anti-authoritarians, anarchists recognise that human beings have a social nature and that they mutually influence each other. We cannot escape the &quot;authority&quot; of this mutual influence, because, as Bakunin reminds us:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''&quot;The abolition of this mutual influence would be death. And when we advocate the freedom of the masses, we are by no means suggesting the abolition of any of the natural influences that individuals or groups of individuals exert on them. What we want is the abolition of influences which are artificial, privileged, legal, official.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;quoted by Malatesta, Anarchy, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, those influences which stem from hierarchical authority.

This is because hierarchical systems like capitalism deny liberty and, as a result, people's ''&quot;mental, moral, intellectual and physical qualities are dwarfed, stunted and crushed&quot;'' (see section B.1 for more details). Thus one of ''&quot;the grand truths of Anarchism&quot;'' is that ''&quot;to be really free is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as each allows all to do the same.&quot;'' This is why anarchists fight for a better society, for a society which respects individuals and their freedom. Under capitalism, ''&quot;[e]verything is upon the market for sale: all is merchandise and commerce&quot;'' but there are ''&quot;certain things that are priceless. Among these are life, liberty and happiness, and these are things which the society of the future, the free society, will guarantee to all.&quot;'' Anarchists, as a result, seek to make people aware of their dignity, individuality and liberty and to encourage the spirit of revolt, resistance and solidarity in those subject to authority. This gets us denounced by the powerful as being breakers of the peace, but anarchists consider the struggle for freedom as infinitely better than the peace of slavery. Anarchists, as a result of our ideals, ''&quot;believe in peace at any price - except at the price of liberty. But this precious gift the wealth-producers already seem to have lost. Life . . . they have; but what is life worth when it lacks those elements which make for enjoyment?&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Lucy Parsons, Liberty, Equality &amp; Solidarity, p. 103, p. 131, p. 103 and p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

So, in a nutshell, Anarchists seek a society in which people interact in ways which enhance the liberty of all rather than crush the liberty (and so potential) of the many for the benefit of a few. Anarchists do not want to give others power over themselves, the power to tell them what to do under the threat of punishment if they do not obey. Perhaps non-anarchists, rather than be puzzled why anarchists are anarchists, would be better off asking what it says about themselves that they feel this attitude needs any sort of explanation.

==A.2 What does anarchism stand for?==

These words by Percy Bysshe Shelley gives an idea of what anarchism stands for in practice and what ideals drive it: 


&lt;center&gt;'''''The man'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys:'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Power, like a desolating pestilence,'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Pollutes whate'er it touches, and obedience,'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''Makes slaves of men, and, of the human frame,'''''&lt;br /&gt;
'''''A mechanised automaton.'''''&lt;/center&gt;


As Shelley's lines suggest, anarchists place a high priority on liberty, desiring it both for themselves and others. They also consider individuality -- that which makes one a unique person -- to be a most important aspect of humanity. They recognise, however, that individuality does not exist in a vacuum but is a '''social''' phenomenon. Outside of society, individuality is impossible, since one needs other people in order to develop, expand, and grow. 

Moreover, between individual and social development there is a reciprocal effect: individuals grow within and are shaped by a particular society, while at the same time they help shape and change aspects of that society (as well as themselves and other individuals) by their actions and thoughts. A society not based on free individuals, their hopes, dreams and ideas would be hollow and dead. Thus, ''&quot;the making of a human being. . . is a collective process, a process in which both community and the individual '''participate'''.&quot;'' [Murray Bookchin, '''The Modern Crisis''', p. 79] Consequently, any political theory which bases itself purely on the social or the individual is false. 

In order for individuality to develop to the fullest possible extent, anarchists consider it essential to create a society based on three principles: '''liberty''', '''equality''' and '''solidarity'''. These principles are shared by all anarchists. Thus we find, the communist-anarchist Peter Kropotkin talking about a revolution inspired by ''&quot;the beautiful words, Liberty, Equality and Solidarity.&quot;'' ['''The Conquest of Bread''', p. 128] Individualist-anarchist Benjamin Tucker wrote of a similar vision, arguing that anarchism ''&quot;insists on Socialism . . . on true Socialism, Anarchistic Socialism: the prevalance on earth of Liberty, Equality, and Solidarity.&quot;'' ['''Instead of a Book''', p. 363] All three principles are interdependent. 

Liberty is essential for the full flowering of human intelligence, creativity, and dignity. To be dominated by another is to be denied the chance to think and act for oneself, which is the only way to grow and develop one's individuality. Domination also stifles innovation and personal responsibility, leading to conformity and mediocrity. Thus the society that maximises the growth of individuality will necessarily be based on voluntary association, not coercion and authority. To quote Proudhon, ''&quot;All associated and all free.&quot;'' Or, as Luigi Galleani puts it, anarchism is ''&quot;the autonomy of the individual within the freedom of association&quot;'' ['''The End of Anarchism?''', p. 35] (See further section A.2.2). 

If liberty is essential for the fullest development of individuality, then equality is essential for genuine liberty to exist. There can be no real freedom in a class-stratified, hierarchical society riddled with gross inequalities of power, wealth, and privilege. For in such a society only a few -- those at the top of the hierarchy -- are relatively free, while the rest are semi-slaves. Hence without equality, liberty becomes a mockery -- at best the &quot;freedom&quot; to choose one's master (boss), as under capitalism. Moreover, even the elite under such conditions are not really free, because they must live in a stunted society made ugly and barren by the tyranny and alienation of the majority. And since individuality develops to the fullest only with the widest contact with other free individuals, members of the elite are restricted in the possibilities for their own development by the scarcity of free individuals with whom to interact. (See also section A.2.5) 

Finally, solidarity means mutual aid: working voluntarily and co-operatively with others who share the same goals and interests. But without liberty and equality, society becomes a pyramid of competing classes based on the domination of the lower by the higher strata. In such a society, as we know from our own, it's &quot;dominate or be dominated,&quot; &quot;dog eat dog,&quot; and &quot;everyone for themselves.&quot; Thus &quot;rugged individualism&quot; is promoted at the expense of community feeling, with those on the bottom resenting those above them and those on the top fearing those below them. Under such conditions, there can be no society-wide solidarity, but only a partial form of solidarity within classes whose interests are opposed, which weakens society as a whole. (See also section A.2.6) 

It should be noted that solidarity does not imply self-sacrifice or self-negation. As Errico Malatesta makes clear: 

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''&quot;we are all egoists, we all seek our own satisfaction. But the anarchist finds his greatest satisfaction in struggling for the good of all, for the achievement of a society in which he [sic] can be a brother among brothers, and among healthy, intelligent, educated, and happy people. But he who is adaptable, who is satisfied to live among slaves and draw profit from the labour of slaves, is not, and cannot be, an anarchist.&quot;'' ['''Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas''', p. 23] 

&lt;/blockquote&gt; For anarchists, '''real''' wealth is other people and the planet on which we live. Or, in the words of Emma Goldman, it ''&quot;consists in things of utility and beauty, in things which help to create strong, beautiful bodies and surroundings inspiring to live in . . . [Our] goal is the freest possible expression of all the latent powers of the individual . . . Such free display of human energy being possible only under complete individual and social freedom,&quot;'' in other words ''&quot;social equality.&quot;'' ['''Red Emma Speaks''', pp. 67-8] 

Also, honouring individuality does not mean that anarchists are idealists, thinking that people or ideas develop outside of society. Individuality and ideas grow and develop within society, in response to material and intellectual interactions and experiences, which people actively analyse and interpret. Anarchism, therefore, is a '''materialist''' theory, recognising that ideas develop and grow from social interaction and individuals' mental activity (see Michael Bakunin's '''God and the''' '''State''' for the classic discussion of materialism versus idealism). 

This means that an anarchist society will be the creation of human beings, not some deity or other transcendental principle, since ''&quot;[n]othing ever arranges itself, least of all in human relations. It is men [sic] who do the arranging, and they do it according to their attitudes and understanding of things.&quot;'' [Alexander Berkman, '''What is Anarchism?''', p. 185] 

Therefore, anarchism bases itself upon the power of ideas and the ability of people to act and transform their lives based on what they consider to be right. In other words, liberty.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Assistive Technology in Education:
		 An Critical analysis of the “Highs” and the “Lows” 
	

	Currently, educators in schools are instructing growing numbers of children with special needs in both self-contained and regular classroom settings (Hopkins, 2004). By trying to make the curriculum accessible to all students, teachers are incorporating a wide variety of tools in order to satisfy the wide range of needs that students require (Poel, 2007). As educators, our quest is to sidestep any barriers that may stand in the way of our students’ success and we are achieving this by implementing various assistive technologies in the classroom (Milone, 2000). It is the intention of this paper to shed some light on the misconceptions that surround assistive technology and introduce the reader to both the benefits and drawbacks of assistive technology so that they can make a more informed judgment on the topic.

	Notably, the greatest misconception amongst educators is the idea that all assistive technology is incredibly “high--tech”. These days when the words assistive technology are employed, the image of a computer comes to the forefront.  The reality however is that for centuries, teachers were incorporating “low” tech assistive technological alternatives into their programs to aide their students’ success (Lewis, 1998).  Any technology, when employed in a manner that is instructive and aids a student with acquisition of information, becomes by definition an assistive technology.  Examples of low tech assistive technologies are items such as eyeglasses, canes, highlighters, wheel chairs, calculators and pencil grips. Examples of more high technological assistive technologies include items such as speech to text software, calculators that talk, and voice activated computers (Learning Disabilities Association, Minneapolis, MN, 2006).

 
What exactly is Assistive Technology?


Assistive Technology (AT) represents any item, piece of equipment, product or system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, which is used to directly assist, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with learning disabilities (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] 20, Chapter 33, Section 1401 [25] USA). Since disabilities can impose barriers to full participation in school, at work, and in other important areas of life, it is only fair in an egalitarian society to provide Assistive Technologies that offer ways to surmount those barriers, and create a more level playing field so to speak (Lewis, 1998). Assistive Technology certainly does not claim to remedy every disability, it is simply another tool that is implemented to help a user with a learning disability accomplish a task with a degree of independence. If the appropriate technology is selected, it can notably aid individuals with disabilities to participate more so than they could without any aids. Assistive technologies therefore provide a vehicle to help individuals with disabilities move towards a more inclusive educational setting (Hopkins, 2004).



The Great Debate: Do We Really Need AT’s: An Examination of the Myths and Realities of Assistive Technology


	Assistive technology is shrouded in a great deal of controversy amongst educators and the general public alike. After conducting a great deal of research, the learning disability society of Canada published a fact sheet to help elucidate the use of technology and to lessen the misunderstandings surrounding the issue.


MYTH #1:  
	Many people believe that AT is a ‘cop out’, meaning that it is not so aptly named and cannot assist individuals with disabilities to work towards a greater independence (Learning Disability Association of Canada, 2003).


REALITY: 
	 Despite any debate to the contrary, any tool that may assist a student in receiving a fair and just education should never be viewed as a cop out. Many researchers have gone so far as to liken assistive technology to a cognitive prosthesis (Cavalier, Ferretti, &amp; Okolo, 1994).  The reality of this scenario of course is that just as an individual who requires a wheelchair, which incidentally is an assistive technology, individuals with learning disabilities also require technology to help them ameliorate the difficulties experienced in areas of reading, writing, mathematics and a plethora of other areas (Learning Disability Association of Canada, 2003). Consider the student with a visual impairment who has difficulty reading. If the student cannot read with vision, then educators must elicit another avenue to help the student learn to read. Teachers can provide work that has been translated into braille they can present the materials being taught in an auditory manner, depending on the student and their learning style (Burgstahler &amp; Nourse, 2000). Programs like Kurzweil can be used to download text materials and convert them to speech for students and screen-reading software like Jaws produced by Henter-Joyce can act as a students guide when they are using computers. It works with the computer’s software to verbally communicate what is on the computer screen (Vaccarella, 2001).


MYTH#2
	Another widely circulating myth is that assistive technologies are superfluous and a luxury at best (The Learning Disability Society of Canada, 2003).


REALITY:
	 Would anyone question a student wearing a pair of glasses or getting around in a wheelchair as taking luxuries upon themselves?  No, and this is because these technologies are necessitated in order for people with disabilities to circumvent their disabilities and participate more freely in every day life (Johansen, 1997). Certain Individuals require assistive technologies throughout their entire educational careers, they are not just resources that are used sporadically as a recreational aid. AT is imperative if individuals with disabilities are to work towards independence in order to help foster a sense of autonomy (Grimaldi &amp; Goette, 1999). Exemplary of this are studies revealing that when various computing assistive technologies are employed by students, they encourage creativity and greater problem solving as the students energy is put into the creative aspect of their work rather than the physical energy they would have to exert the aid/aids (Lewis, 1998). 


MYTH#3:
	As the confusion around assistive technology swirls, the ‘one size fits all’ mentality is also believed to be a solution. This refers to the idea that one AT will work for any and all impaired students (Learning Disability Association of Canada, 2003).


REALITY:
	AT’s must be subject to continuous change and what once aided a student previously may not aid them today. Suiting the assistive technology to the student is a very personal and individualized experience. Different tools work for different students, just as various teaching strategies are used to meet the needs of our varying student base. As such, assistive technologies can indeed aid students with a broad range of learning disabilities and these technologies can help people of all ages and needs. Taking the time to find the appropriate tools that work for an individual can provide great success and not providing these tools would serve against our greater educational goals of equality and fairness (Watts, O’Brian &amp; Wojcik, 2004).


Current Criticisms and Areas Requiring Further Consideration


	There are various factors that should be considered when discussing the topic of assistive technologies. Consider these criticisms of AT from the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada. 
	One finding, that is very problematic, is that students are not properly trained to use certain assistive technologies and are not afforded the appropriate amount of time to use them. 
	Another finding is that some technologies are matched inappropriately to the students needs, often times resulting in the technology being too complicated for the student to employ. Combined with a lack of funding this means less training time is available for the student to become adequately familiar themselves with the AT.
	 Educators have also been found to not have the know-how to appropriately adapt or repair the technologies they are utilizing. If the educator has not mastered the use and logic behind the AT’s application, how will the student? 
	Parents too are not spared from this criticism. It is invaluable for them to also become aware of the technologies being used to aid their children, just as aware of the subject matter being taught day to day (Smith &amp; Kelley, 2007). This parental concern also extends outside the school as parents can provide additional supports at home to enhance the AT’s familiarity and subsequent success rates for their child. On a more macro institutional level, criticism must be brought to the academic institutions that prohibit the AT’s from leaving the classroom. As such, homework continues to be a problem for a student who uses assistive technology (Specht, Howell &amp; Young, 2007). Disabling this possibility  is  tantamount to disabling the average student without a disability from taking their books home. How can we not view these as existing on the same fairness continuum? 
	On the whole, the most common concern raised is that Assistive Technologies have not been successfully integrated into the day to day activities of a disabled student, whether at home or in the classroom (Learning Disabilities of Canada, 2003). This concern involves addressing all of the above criticisms and will remain a potent consideration for our current and future educators to research and assuage.


Why should we have assistive technology in schools?

	In our classroom, the implications for our students are quite profound. Learning is a highly complex and individualized process. There are many faculties that must be tapped into, a learner must be able to acquire, store and illustrate that knowledge.  However, the reality is that learning strategies and study skills may not be the same for most students. Not every student communicates in the same manner and for some, communicating can become a very laborious and painful endeavour. It is imperative that as educators we are open to and aware of all of the technologies available to us to aid our students who do not fit an outdated cookie cut model of what the average student is.“To persons with disabilities, technology is a means of empowerment; denying them that option exacerbates their disability's effects.” (Lewis, 1998 p 25). Here is a passage written by a student with a visual impairment that has such profound implications for education and why educators should harness any technology, whether it be rudimentary or cutting edge technology, to assist their students:

	I grew up with assistive technology. When people think of assistive technology, they think of complicated machines and hard-to-use computer programs. But that isn’t what assistive technology is. A white cane, for example, is an assistive technology. A magnifying glass is also an assistive technology. Assistive technology means something that helps a person do something that is otherwise hard to do. Glasses, for example, help near-sighted individuals see things far away, therefore they are an assistive technology. Through seven stages of education, I have been slowly introduced to new assistive technologies. 
Starting with Senior kindergarten, I was introduced to the white cane. By performing sweeping gestures with it, I can find if there is anything in front of me when the cane hits it. 
	In grade one, I was made familiar with the Perkins Brailler. This cleverly crafted piece of technology allows blind or visually impaired people to write and read. Six keys on this machine, when pressed, punch a hole through a paper inserted into the Perkins, creating a small bump on the other side. Each key will materialize a bump on a different location. By combining these six bumps, different letters are made. This type of writing is called Braille. Three other buttons are also present on this machine: space, next line, and backspace.
	In grade two, I was introduced to the CCTV. This machine magnifies anything you put under it onto a large screen. You can also change some settings such as contrast and zoom percentage. This product is designed for only those with a visual impairment. Because I was more blind than sighted, this piece of equipment did not help me. 
	In grade three, I was introduced to the computer. By using a screen reading program called Jaws, I could hear anything on the screen with the touch of a button. This program opened new doors and lit passageways for my future. I no longer needed to tediously type on a loud, slow Perkins. With this program, I could read documents, brows the internet, and even play games.
	In grade four, I was introduced to the Braille Note. This machine is almost like a computer, except it was smaller, and had limited functionality. It was like a laptop. Whenever I couldn’t go to my computer, or needed to do work in class, I would use this machine’s word processor, complete with it’s own spell checker and formatting options. After I was done typing, I could transfer my document on to the computer and print it out. This machine was a big help.
	Through different levels of education, I was introduced to different assistive technologies, each better than the previous. But the assistive technologies were not the only things that helped me become confident and a hard worker. It was the support of my parents, and my wonderful teachers. I think that if I was introduced to these technologies, and they helped me, every other student in the world who needs them should have the right to have them, no matter what age, sex, country or ethnicity. Here I conclude by saying that assistive technology, truly is assistive, no matter if it is a pair of glasses or a complicated computer.

					-Hussain, Gifted Grade 6 student.

	
As a teacher who is currently teaching this wonderfully gifted student with a visual impairment, I can personally attest to the necessity of AT’s. I am constantly bewildered at how education can be seen as anything resembling adequate or fair without AT’s mandated existence and application. The fact alone that AT’s are not addressed in the preservice curriculum for educators is proof positive we have much work to do in addressing issues of equality and fairness. Without having educators understand the value and necessity of these tools, how can we provide students with the tools needed to fully realize their potential? Quite frankly, to have even one student prohibited from a fair and equal education is to fail all students and to that end serious changes must be made to the application of, and appreciation of, the ideological justifications behind Assistive Technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic premises ==
There are some basic operating principles that are foundational to the concept of Open Source PIM. At the center of this foundation is a fundamental assumption: the user of software is in the best position to determine what meets her own individual needs. Those in the position of expertise in the realm of software delivery should therefore not assume that &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;.

=== Range of user abilities ===
Effective Open Source PIM should provide the user with a range of abilities, these include:

* ability to mix-and-match disparate components with minimal switching costs or downtime
* ability to evaluate and distinguish between various options with minimal effort
* ability to decouple independent elements of a system in ways that do not &quot;break&quot; re-integration with other systems
* ability to use a consistent set of operating metaphors and a unified work flow
* ability to change operating metaphors without loss of information

== Specific methods ==
* recognition over recall
* selective recall
* selective attentiveness

=== Recognition over recall ===
Give the user the most opportunities possible to direct their interactions through recall of past interactions, and recognition of commonly-understood interactions.

* maximize use of common metaphors
* maximize use of explanatory metaphors for
* phased-reduction distractive elements such as &quot;eye candy&quot; and &quot;entertainment&quot;
** these can be useful and effective in initial phases, but eventually the user will be less interested in the application and more interested in simply getting something done

=== Selective recall ===
There will always be some arbitrary elements that the user will have to commit to memory. A common example are &quot;keyboard shortcuts&quot; used in some large applications. The principle of selective recall dictates that the end-user should be allowed the flexibility to ''choose'' which elements she wishes to commit to memory, and which elements she would rather submit to &quot;recognition-over-recall&quot;. 

Allowing the user to choose which parts of an application are important enough to memorize, and which are only ancillary produces significant benefits. Moreover, it is possible to design interfaces that easily facilitate this kind of choice with well-established practices. 

For example, in the case of keyboard shortcuts, the user should be able to:
* choose which actions get assigned and re-assigned to which keyboard shortcuts
* get a quick preview of which keyboard shortcuts are already assigned and where, to avoid assignment collisions
* have quick access to menus for individual actions that are not assigned to keyboard shortcuts
* filter and incrementally search through visual menus for actions not assigned to keyboard shortcuts

=== Selective attentiveness ===
The user can only focus on a limited range of inputs. Selective attentiveness, therefore, is a principle that emphasizes minimalism and reduction of awareness to only that which is specifically relevant at any given point in time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Processing XML often involves the creation of intermediate XML fragments for subsequent processing.  Here is an example of two approaches, one using multiple passes on the same data, the other a constructed intermediate view of the data.

== MusicXML ==

[http://www.recordare.com/xml.html MusicXML] is an XML application for recording music scores.  There is a range of software which produces and consumes MusicXML.


There are two styles of MusicXML with two related schemas, one in which measures are within parts (partwise), the other in which parts are within measures (timewise).

An example of a MusicXML partwise score is [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Music/examples/MozartPianoSonata.xml Mozart's Piano Sonata in A Major, K. 331]

Here is a sample definition of a note: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;note&gt;
   &lt;pitch&gt;
      &lt;step&gt;A&lt;/step&gt;
      &lt;octave&gt;3&lt;/octave&gt;
   &lt;/pitch&gt;
   &lt;duration&gt;2&lt;/duration&gt;
   &lt;voice&gt;3&lt;/voice&gt;
   &lt;type&gt;eighth&lt;/type&gt;
   &lt;stem&gt;down&lt;/stem&gt;
   &lt;staff&gt;2&lt;/staff&gt;
   &lt;beam number=&quot;1&quot;&gt;begin&lt;/beam&gt;
   &lt;notations&gt;
      &lt;slur type=&quot;stop&quot; number=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/notations&gt;
&lt;/note&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Notes Range ==

The Recordare site has some sample code to demonstrate the use of XQuery to process MusicXML [http://www.recordare.com/good/max2002%2Dupdate.html]. The first script finds the lowest and highest notes in the score. The script shown on the site is not conformant to the current XQuery standard, but a few minor changes brings it up-to-date.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

declare function local:MidiNote($thispitch as element(pitch) ) as xs:integer
{
  let $step := $thispitch/step
  let $alter :=
    if (empty($thispitch/alter)) then 0
    else xs:integer($thispitch/alter)
  let $octave := xs:integer($thispitch/octave)
  let $pitchstep :=
    if ($step = &quot;C&quot;) then 0
    else if ($step = &quot;D&quot;) then 2
    else if ($step = &quot;E&quot;) then 4
    else if ($step = &quot;F&quot;) then 5
    else if ($step = &quot;G&quot;) then 7
    else if ($step = &quot;A&quot;) then 9
    else if ($step = &quot;B&quot;) then 11
    else 0
  return 12 * ($octave + 1) + $pitchstep + $alter
} ;

== Ancestor access ==

The path to the measure in which a note is located 
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $highmeas := string($highpitch[1]/../../@number)
&lt;/source&gt;

uses a fixed set of steps back up the hierarchy.  This limits the application of this script to one type of MusicXML schema because the position of the measure in the hierarchy is different in the two schemas. When the script was written, the ancestor axis was not supported but it is now, so those lines are more generally expressible as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $highmeas := string($highpitch/ancestor::measure/@number)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Note-to-midi==

The function to convert notes to midi numbers uses nested if-then-else expressions.  XQuery lacks a switch expression which might be used but a clearer approach would be to use a lookup-table, defined either locally in the script or stored in the database.

Here  a sequence of notes is created as a look-up table.  This is bound to a global variable which is used in a revised note-to-midi function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable  $NOTESTEP := 
(
   &lt;note name=&quot;C&quot; stepNo=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;D&quot; stepNo=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;E&quot; stepNo=&quot;4&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;F&quot; stepNo=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;G&quot; stepNo=&quot;7&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;A&quot; stepNo=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;B&quot; stepNo=&quot;11&quot;/&gt;
);

declare function local:MidiNote($thispitch as element(pitch) ) as xs:integer
{
  let $alter := xs:integer(($thispitch/alter,0)[1])
  let $octave := xs:integer($thispitch/octave)
  let $pitchstepNo := xs:integer($NOTESTEP[@name = $thispitch/step]/@stepNo)
  return 12 * ($octave + 1) + $pitchstepNo + $alter
} ;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Intermediate XML  ==

The original script required repeated access to the original MusicXML source.  An alternative approach would be to create an intermediate structure to hold the midi notes and use this in subsequent analysis.  This structure is a computed view of the original notes augmented with derived data - the midi note and the measure.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
 
let $midiNotes :=
       for $pitch in  $part//pitch
       return 
             &lt;pitch&gt;
                     {$pitch/*}
                     &lt;midi&gt;{local:MidiNote($pitch)}&lt;/midi&gt;
                     &lt;measure&gt;{string($pitch/../../@number)}&lt;/measure&gt;
             &lt;/pitch&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

and this view is then used to locate the high and low notes and their position in the score:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

let $highnote := max($midiNotes/midi)
let $lownote  := min($midiNotes/midi) 

let $highpitch := $midiNotes[midi = $highnote]
let $lowpitch := $midiNotes[midi = $lownote]
 

&lt;/source&gt;
== Revised script ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare variable  $NOTESTEP := 
(
   &lt;note name=&quot;C&quot; step=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;D&quot;  step=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;E&quot; step=&quot;4&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;F&quot; step=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;G&quot; step=&quot;7&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;A&quot; step=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;,
   &lt;note name=&quot;B&quot; step=&quot;11&quot;/&gt;
);

declare function local:MidiNote($thispitch as element(pitch) ) as xs:integer
{
  let $alter := xs:integer(($thispitch/alter,0)[1])
  let $octave := xs:integer($thispitch/octave)
  let $name := $thispitch/step
  let $pitchstep := xs:integer($NOTESTEP[@name = $name]/@step)
  return 12 * ($octave + 1) + $pitchstep + $alter
} ;

let $doc := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Music/examples/MozartPianoSonata.xml&quot;)
let $part := $doc//part[./@id = &quot;P1&quot;]
 
let $midiNotes :=
       for $pitch in  $part//pitch
        return 
             &lt;pitch&gt;
                     {$pitch/*}
                      &lt;midi&gt;{local:MidiNote($pitch)}&lt;/midi&gt;
                       &lt;measure&gt;{string($pitch/ancestor::measure/@number)}&lt;/measure&gt;
              &lt;/pitch&gt;
   
let $highnote := max($midiNotes/midi)
let $lownote  := min($midiNotes/midi) 
 
return
&lt;result&gt;
  &lt;low-note&gt;
      {$midiNotes[midi = $lownote]}
  &lt;/low-note&gt;
  &lt;high-note&gt;
     { $midiNotes[midi = $highnote]}
  &lt;/high-note&gt;
&lt;/result&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==

Although arguably a cleaner, more direct design, the second script relies on the construction of temporary XML nodes which are then the subject of XPath expressions.  These temporary XML nodes are handled differently in different implementations.  In older verisons of eXist each is written to a temporary document in the database which creates an performance overhead and problems of garbage collection.  In the 1.3 release, intermediate XML nodes remain in memory, resulting in a major performance improvement.

There is however another problem with this approach.  The size of the intermediate node may exceed pre-set, but configurable, limits on the size of constructed nodes.

=Installation and configuration=

==Display options==
It is recommended to set your display/graphics card to use 24 or 32 bits per pixel.
The 16-bit mode will work for Eeschema, but in Pcbnew the display will not function correctly under Linux in this mode.

==Initialization of the default configuration==
A default configuration file (kicad.pro) is supplied in kicad/template. It serves as the template for each new project. It can be modified or added to if necessary, usually for the list of libraries to load. Run Eeschema via kicad or directly (Linux command; /usr/local/kicad/bin/eeschema). Update the configuration and then save it in /usr/local/kicad/template/kicad.pro

With Windows, to add a new library with Eeschema, go to '''Preferences''' --&gt; '''Library''' --&gt; Click on the '''Add''' button.  Find the new library file (.lib extension), highlight it &amp; click the '''Open''' button.  Click the '''OK''' button when done.

==Principles of use==
In order to manage simply a project, i.e. all the files it constitutes (representing schematics, printed circuit boards, supplementary libraries, manufacturing files for phototracing, drilling and automatic component placement), it is recommended to create a project:
Create a working directory for the project (using kicad or by other means).
In this directory, use kicad to create the project file (file .pro) via the  icon.

  '''It is strongly recommended to use the same name for the project and its directory.'''

Kicad creates a file with a .pro extension that maintains a number of parameters relating to project management (such as the filename of the principal schematic, list of libraries used in the schematics and PCBs). The default names of both the principal schematic and the printed circuit board are based upon the name of the project. Thus, if a project called example was created in a directory called example, the default files created would be:

'''example.pro''' project management file.

'''example.sch''' principal schematic file.

'''example.brd''' printed circuit board file.

'''example.xxx''' various files created by the other utility programs.

'''example.cache.lib''' cache file of the libraries used in the schematic (backup of the components used)

=Use=


==Main Window==
The main window is composed of a tree view of the project, a pane containing buttons used to run the various utilities, and a message window. 

The menu and the toolbar can be used to create, read and save project files (*.pro).

==Project tree view==

[[Image:Kicad_utility_tree_view.png|left|The project tree]]

Double-clicking on [[Image:Kicad_utility_tree_view_eeschema_file.png]] runs the schematic editor, in this case opening the file interf_u.sch

Double-clicking on [[Image:Kicad_utility_tree_view_pcbnew_file.png]] runs the layout editor, in this case opening the file interf_u.brd

Double-clicking on [[Image:Kicad_utility_tree_view_cvpcb_file.png]] runs the footprint assign program (Cvpcb), in this case opening the file interf_u.net

Right (image) clicking allows files operations

==Toolbar==
[[Image:Kicad_utility_toolbar_new_project.png|left]] Create a configuration file for a new project.  If the template kicad.pro is found in kicad/template, it is copied into the working directory.

[[Image:Kicad_utility_toolbar_open_project.png]] Open an existing project.

[[Image:Kicad_utility_toolbar_save_project.png]] Update (save) the current configuration.

[[Image:Kicad_utility_toolbar_archive_project.png]] Create a zip archive of the whole project (schematic files, libraries, pcb, etc).

Should those be :=  instead?  I'm not entirely clear on the diff in P6 between = and := (more like a ref assignment, right?) but if this is NQP, it should be :=, right?  Hmm, you have also:

  @myarray[1] := 5;
  @b := (@a[3], @a[2], @a[1); 

which is an illegal list usage in NQP but not p6 maybe - just clear up the p6/NQP context of these examples? [[User:Afbach|Afbach]] ([[User talk:Afbach|talk]]) 02:39, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

'nother nit:

   1. We've received a &quot;Hello&quot; or a &quot;Goodbye&quot;, and the system will print a success method.
   2. We've received a different word, and we will receive an error message.
   3. We've received too many words, not enough words, or something that isn't a word. This will cause a parse error.
 Try it!

Maybe #2 as:

   2. We've received a different word, and we will receive the &quot;failure, we found ...&quot; message.

As for &quot;try it&quot; - sure wish there were an easy way to do so ... ;-&gt; [[User:Afbach|Afbach]] ([[User talk:Afbach|talk]]) 02:55, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for the input, you're right that I've made a few mistakes when entering in some of the code. The &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; is an assignment, where the &lt;code&gt;:=&lt;/code&gt; is called a &quot;bind&quot;. I'm not exactly clear on the difference myself, but NQP does not currently allow the former. You're also right that NQP does not currently have a &quot;list context&quot;, so the example you cited is likely me switching into P6 mode, and not in NQP mode like I should be.  I'll work on these things, thanks! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:40, 23 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The 3rd Nerve Palsy==

'''Stem:'''  ''This patient presents with a headache.  Please examine his eyes.''

===Key Features===  
*dilated pupil
*abducted and depressed eye with reduced movement
*ipsilateral ptosis

===Look for===
*IV nerve palsy  (tilt head towards side of lesion)
*V  nerve palsy  (corneal reflex, sensation V1 / V2)
*VI nerve palsy  (lateral rectus palsy)
*Contralateral UMN signs in Limbs = Weber's D

===Example presentation===
	This patient has a left 3rd nerve palsy, evidenced by a dilated pupil, and an abducted and depressed globe, with paralysis of movement and ptosis.  There are no other cranial nerve abnormalities.  The cause may be a berry aneurysm, causing headache and compressing the nerve.  I would also consider a diabetic 3rd nerve palsy, or hypertension – although these would spare the pupil; or also a stroke in the midbrain, which would usually be accompanied by contralateral pyramidal signs; or a lesion in the cavernous sinus.

'''Stem:''' ''This patient has difficulty speaking.  Please examine the relevant cranial nerves and proceed.''

==Key Signs==

*XII:
**Bulbar
***Tongue weakness
***wasting
***fasiculations
**Psudobulbar
***Spastic – unable to protrude
*IX / X
**Decreased voluntary palate elevation
**Gag hyperreactive (PB) or absent (B)
*VII
**Weakness of facial movement (both)
**Normal movement with laughing
*V
**Weakness of jaw opening / closure (both)
**Jaw jerk increased (PB) or absent (B)

'' (B = bulbar / PB = psuedobulbar / PMA = progressive muscular atrophy)''

*Upper / Lower Limbs:
**Inspection:  Wasting / Fasiculations
**Power:  Predominantly distal weakness, esp of finger abduction
**Reflexes:  Usually present in wasted muscles, although may be absent in SMA. Extensor plantar
**Sensation:  Normal
*Higher centres:  Normal function
*Speech – nasal (bulbar) or indistinct / “Donald Duck” (PB)

==Proceed to==
*? PEG tube
*Respiratory weakness
** Forced Expiratory Time
** Spirometry / Ask for RFTs

==Example Presentation==

This patient has clincal features of motor neurone disease, including mixed bulbar signs such as tongue wasting and fasiculations, with pseudobulbar signs such as increased gag reflex and jaw jerk.  In the upper and lower limbs, there are mixed upper and lower motor neurone signs, with extensor plantars, and weakness of the distal muscles, confirming the diagnosis.  I would also consider ordering an EMG / nerve conduction studies which I would expect to show denervated muscles with fibrillations, but normal conduction velocities.

      <comment>/* Ingredients */general cleanup, typos fixed: parmesan → Parmesan using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

Cappeletti in Brodo is a very simple and very delicious Italian pasta soup, made with Cappeletti (small meat or vegetable filled) ravioli. It's delicious on a cold day, getting in from a long day at work, and without much time to devote to preparing a tasty meal. Best served with some home made garlic bread and a healthy salad.

==Ingredients==

*250Gr packet of Cappelletti pasta pillows
*1/2 litre of water but more water to be added to thin out the soup if required
*2 good quality chicken stock cubes 
*1/2 cup of single cream
*1 pinch of ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]] (as much as can be held between the finger/thumb)
*A dash of [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*A handful of chopped parsley
*A dash (you decide how big or small!) of sweet sherry
*Fresh grated Parmesan to serve

==Procedure==

#Bring the water to a rolling boil and add the stock cubes and let dissolve.
#Add the Cappelletti pasta and cook according to the instructions on the packet
#Add the cream and the parsely about 2 minutes before the end of the cooking, and turn down the heat
#Add the slug of sherry just before serving (or indeed if serving to children, the sherry can be added to the grown-up's plate ''after'' serving!!)

Let stand for a few minutes (whilst you pour a glass of wine, seat the guests and distribute the Garlic bread... which is a must with this dish)... serve, sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese...and enjoy.

Further serving suggestion might include a green salad, or a cold bean salad.

Note: the number for 15 is irregular


====Manchu ordinal numerals====

Ordinal numbers in Manchu are formed by adding ‘-ci’ to the end of the cardinal form of the number. In the case of numbers that end in an ‘n’, the final n is dropped (except for in the case of juwan and tumen). E.g:
* emuci	(First)
* juwe tanggv susai emuci (251st)
* ningguci	(Sixth)
* minggaci 	(One thousandth) 
* juwanci	(Tenth)
* tumenci	(Ten thousandth)
* juwan duici (Fourteenth)


====Manchu distributive numerals====

Distributive numerals can be formed by adding the suffix ‘-ta’, ‘-te’ or ‘-to’ depending on the rules of vowel harmony. E.g.:
* ilata (one of three)
* tofohoto (one of 15)
* emte (one each).


====Manchu multiplicative numerals====

As for multiplicative numerals, one can either use the word ‘ubu’ (times), or use one of the postpositions such as ‘mudan’ (time), ‘jergi’ (time). E.g.:
* juwe ubu (twice)
* juwe mudan (twice)
* juwe jergi (twice) 


====Manchu fractions====

Fractional numerals can be formed by either using the genitive or ablative case, or by using the dative/locative case in combination with the word ‘ubu’ (times). E.g
* sunja i emu (1/5)
* sunja ci emu (1/5)
* sunja ubu de emu ubu (1/5).

===Adjectives===


Adjectives can be divided into:
* Original Adjectives(性质形容词) 
* Adjectives formed from other words (派生形容词)


====Original adjectives====

Original adjectives are adjectives that are not formed from other types of words. Original adjectives can be divided into:

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives describing special features of a person or an object.&lt;/u&gt;

For example:
* amba (big)
* ajige (small)
* golmin (long)

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives describing the character (nature) of a person or object.&lt;/u&gt;

For example:
* sain (good)
* ice (new)
* fe (old)

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives describing the action or change of state of a person or object.&lt;/u&gt;

For example:
* hanci (near)
* labdu (many)
* goro (far away)


====Adjectives formed from other words====

These are adjectives that are formed by adding suffixes (subject to the rules of vowel harmony) to nouns, verbs, or original adjectives.
Adjectives formed from other words can be divided into:

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives formed from nouns&lt;/u&gt; 

These adjectives are formed by adding the suffix '''‘-ngge’, ‘-ngga’''', or '''‘-nggo’''' to the end of a noun. This suffix is similar in many ways to Chinese 的 (except it is not a true possessive suffix). For example, enduri (spirit/神) --&gt; enduri-'''ngge''' (holy/神圣的) and can basically be translated as &quot;to possess the quality of....&quot;. 

The suffix '-ngge' but not '-ngga' or '-nggo' later became a proper possessive suffix (like Chinese 的). When written it is proceeded by the genetive case and therefore becomes one of '-ingge' or '-ningge'. In the case of use with personal pronouns, it is already proceeded by the genitive form of the pronoun so remains '-ngge'. It can be translated as 'belongging to', and is often written separately from the noun. E.g. ejen ningge - belonging to the master. 

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives formed from verbs&lt;/u&gt;

These can be divided into three types:
* Adjectives that can be formed from verbs by adding the suffix '''‘-cuka’, ‘-cuke’'''.
* Adjectives that can be formed from verbs by adding the suffix (these are also occasionally used to form adjectives from nouns) '''‘-shvn’, ‘-shun’ ‘-hvn’, ‘-hun’'''.
* Adjectives that can be formed from verbs by adding the suffix '''‘-su’, ‘-be’, ‘-ba’'''.

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives formed from original adjectives&lt;/u&gt;

These adjectives are formed by adding the suffix '''‘-linggv’, ‘-linggu’''' to the end of original adjectives. Note: adjectives that end in an ‘n’ drop the ‘n’ when adding the suffix ‘-linggu’, or ‘-linggv’. The suffix ‘-linggu’ can be translated as ‘very’. E.g. if you add ‘-lingu’ to the adjective amba (big) you get ambalinggu (huge).

====Forms of Manchu adjectives====

Manchu adjectives have three different forms (级):

&lt;u&gt;The normal form (原级)&lt;/u&gt;

This is the normal form of the adjective and does not include any suffixes. E.g:
* den alin (high mountain)
* ice bithe (new book)

&lt;u&gt;The comparative form (比较级)&lt;/u&gt;

This form only applies to original adjectives, and involves a comparison, i.e. bigger, smaller etc. To form the comparative form a suffix is added to the end of the adjective to change its meaning. The main suffixes are:
*	-kan (-ken, -kon, -gan, -gen, -cen)
*	-liyan (-liyen), -meliyan
*	-shun, -shvn
*	-si
*	-linggv (-linggu) (see 5.2)

With these suffixes the final ‘n’ of the adjective stem is dropped when the suffix is added. E.g. ‘den’ (high) + -ken becomes ‘deken’ (higher, comparatively high). Examples of the use of these suffixes include:

|'''Suffix'''
|'''Meaning'''
|'''Example'''
|-
| -kan, (-ken, -kon, -gan, -gen, -cen)
|Rather, somewhat
|ambakan (somewhat bigger)
|-
| -liyan (-liyen), -meliyan
|A bit, somewhat
|adaliliyan (a bit similar)
|-
| -linggv (-linggu)	
|Very
|ambalinggv (huge, very big)
|-
| -shvn (-shun)	
|Rather	
|aibishvn (rather swollen)
|-
| -si
|Rather
|ajigesi (rather small)
|-
|........................................................
|........................................................
|........................................................
|-
|}

The comparative can also be formed by placing the word ‘majige’ (a bit) before the adjective. E.g majige amba (a bit big). When creating comparative constructions, the ablative case marker is used: 

* E.g. nikan gisun '''ci''' manju gisun ja - Manchu is easier than Chinese
* E.g. emu inenggi '''ci''' emu inenggi halukan oho - Each day is hotter than the one before 



&lt;u&gt;The superlative form (最高级)&lt;/u&gt;

The superlative form of the Manchu can be formed by placing an adverb before the adjective. For example:
* ‘jaci’ - jaci amba – very big
* ‘umesi’ – umesi sain – very good

It can also be formed by using the comparative construction, or by use of the genetive case. For example:
* geren ci amba - bigger than all (the biggest)
* ujui uju oyonggo baita - the first of the first important thing (the most important thing)

''By: Renu Kumar''

'''Introduction'''

“An e-portfolio is a digitized collection of artifacts, including demonstrations, resources, and accomplishments that represent an individual, group, community, organization, or institution.  This collection can be comprised of text-based, graphic, or multimedia elements archived on a Web site or on other electronic media such as CD-ROM or DVD” (Lorrenzo &amp; Ittelson, 2005, p. 1).  They can also be defined as “personalized, Web-based collections of work, responses to work, and reflections that are used to demonstrate key skills and accomplishments for a variety of contexts and time periods” (Lorrenzo &amp; Ittelson, 2005, p. 3). 
 

There are mainly three types or applications of e-portfolios: Course portfolio, Program portfolio, and Institutional portfolio (Stefani, Mason, &amp; Pegler, 2007).  Course portfolios are usually assembled by students for one course.  They document and reflect upon the ways in which the student has met the outcomes for that particular course.  They can also be part of course assessment.  Program portfolios are developed by students to document the work they have completed, the skills they have learned, and the outcomes they have met in an academic program or department.  Students can use them to show-case their work to prospective employers.  Institutional portfolios are mainly used as personal development planning tools in which each individual’s records are documented, including future plans and extra-curricular activities.  


E-portfolios are being used to meet a variety of learning requirements such as Assessment (demonstrate achievement against a criteria), Presentations (evidence learning in a persuasive way), Learning (document, guide, and advance learning over time), Personal development, and Multiple owners (allowing more that one person to contribute and participate in the content) (Stefani et al., 2007). 


Student e-portfolios are a product of faculty-assigned, print-based student portfolios from the mid-80s (typically used in art-related programs and in disciplines with mostly writing components, such as English and communication studies).  They gained prominence in higher education during the mid-90s and continue to be increasingly popular (Lorrenzo &amp; Ittelson, 2005).  E-portfolios are an obvious extension to paper-based folios in this e-learning age with some added advantages.  With digital portfolios, it is easier to rearrange, edit, and combine materials.  They offer a variety of layouts and storage of different forms of content both multimedia and text-based.  The student can use hyperlinking to connect documents together linking between the portfolio elements and also external sources and references.  This makes it easier to make associations between different subject areas, learning experiences and artifacts. And finally, e-portfolios are portable and mobile.  The e-portfolio can be potentially accessed anywhere in the world and can be replicated and shared with others.  


'''Impact on Education''' 

If implemented well e-Portfolios can encourage reflective practice, peer and self-evaluation, and assessment.  They can provide an ongoing basis for student’s planning and goal setting.  They could enable and encourage professional learning and promote self-development.  They can cater to a wide range of learning styles.  Students have different learning strategies and e-portfolios can support this diversity.  They can provide a framework for formative and summative assessment.  


Reflection plays a key role in the successful implementation and outcomes of e-portfolios especially in higher education.  “Reflection is an essential feature of a deep approach to learning.  Structuring the practice of reflection transforms it into learning experience” (Stefani et al., 2007, p. 61).  E-Portfolio software allow for various activities that support this learning style.  For example at the beginning of a course, the student can be asked to reflect on what they don’t know, what they would like to learn, and how they want to go about it.  Students can keep a learning journal throughout the course in which they record their thoughts, observations, feelings, and questions.  A ‘critical incident diary’ also works well in e-portfolio software.  The aim of developing reflective learners is to encourage students to be more self-aware and self-critical; to be honest about themselves, and open to criticism and feedback.  An e-portfolio with reflective processes and mentoring by the teacher can develop these qualities in students.  


The use of an e-portfolio over a whole program is becoming relatively common especially at American universities and colleges.  E-portfolios have the potential to facilitate discussion among students and assessors on their work in the context of their prior work, their identified, and future goals.  Teaching students the skill of setting goals for themselves is a life skill like reflection which is critical.  E-portfolio provides the option for peer commenting and allows integrating it directly with student’s work.  Peer commenting on student work is usually a great incentive for improving the quality and effort that students invest in their work. 


Another process facilitated by e-portfolios is mentoring (Stefani et al., 2007).  A number of teachers have noted that while providing advice and guidance to students throughout the course via e-portfolio may seem to be very time consuming activity, it is invaluable as a means of increasing students’ understanding of their own learning.


Helen Barrett, a strong advocate for e-portfolios, comments that a “portfolio’s whole purpose is to foster learning and document growth over time is based upon a constructivist model of learning” (Stefani et al., 2007, p. 74).  She suggests that “portfolio authoring reflects that tenets of constructivism in that it allows for students to begin their learning at many different starting points. Formative feedback or critique challenges the student’s original insights prompting reflection and revision. In this sense, the portfolio is a tool to support the process of learning, and assessment is formative.  The portfolio becomes a story of learning owned by the learner” (Stefani et al., 2007, p. 74).  Jackson believes we should be encouraging students to construct new knowledge rather than to show how much transmitted knowledge they have retained.  This is a ‘constructivist’ view, one which is very important in teaching and learning currently.  This pedagogical approach is frequently associated with e-learning along with student-centered learning (Jackson, 2003).  


Moreover, if the student ‘e-portfolio space’ is linked with the learning management systems like Blackboard, WebCT, or Moodle, then students will have access to full records of their performance both formative and summative assessments.  


'''Issues and Implications'''

A number of the issues are associated with student e-portfolios and an exhaustive list was compiled by Lorenzo and Ittelson (2005) in their article.  Below is a subset of those issues that I believe are critical:

1.	Is a student e-portfolio considered an ‘official’ representation of a particular learning experience?  If the student is allowed to update or change the e-portfolio, is it still ‘official’?

2.	As e-portfolios accumulate year after year, more servers and maintenance are required.  How long should an e-portfolio remain at an institution after the student graduates?  Should students be allowed lifetime access to e-portfolio after they graduate?  Should alumni be charged a fee to keep their e-portfolios on an institution’s servers?

3.	Who owns the e-portfolio? Is it the institution? Should anyone other than the student be able to make changes to the student’s e-portfolio?

4.	How are e-portfolios evaluated so that they are valid?  How do we validate the material added by students to e-portfolios as student’s authentic work? 


''Other challenges are implementation driven:''

1.	How many and what kind of servers will be necessary to hold increasing numbers of e-portfolios?  

2.	How will PERPA regulations impact an e-portfolio system?

3.	What policies are needed for governing information access, security, and privacy? How will they be determined and controlled?

4.	How will an e-portfolio system authenticate that all the work, documentation, and demonstrations were created by the author?

5.	Who owns the records? Can it be transferred to another institution?

6.	Can it be exported to another format for offline usage?

7.	How likely is it that the students and faculty will accept and use the e-portfolio system?

8.	What are the policies around long term maintenance and deletion of e-portfolios?

It is critical for institutions to think through these issues as part of the development and implementation process. 


'''Drawbacks'''

Just like any new technology, e-portfolios have drawbacks as well.  One significant drawback is the limitation to students who are illiterate in technology (Lau, 2005).  Students need to have the right equipment and software in order to work on e-portfolios.  Moreover, students might spend a lot of time focusing on the design rather that on the content (Lau, 2005).  From an administrative point of view, it can be time consuming and labor-intensive for large groups.  For an effective use, it requires proper student and staff training and instruction.  There might be some privacy issues as well.  It might enable plagiarism if it is available via the internet of ones original work, ideas, and thoughts.  The ability for the student to modify contents after evaluation may alter the intended purpose.  And finally, if it is used for grading purposes, it might require some sort of standardization so that it is easier to evaluate.


'''E-Portfolio Software'''

There are several software products available in the market both commercial, open-source, and proprietary for e-portfolio systems.  Some of the commercial ones include eportfolio.org, Taskstream and the built-in portfolio components for learning management systems such as Blackboard and WebCT.  There are several open source products available as well.  Some of the most common ones are Elgg and OSPI.  Many institutions also decide to develop software in-house as it can be customized and provides more flexibility.  Tools such as Blogs, Wikis, e-Journals, and Dreamweaver can also facilitate similar processes and achieve successful outcomes.


'''Case Studies'''

Few institutions have begun to adopt e-portfolios based on their needs and requirements.  Here are few case studies with different models.


1)	'''Linking the e-portfolio and PDP into Masters in Pharmacy degree at Strathclyde School of Pharmacy in UK.'''  The overall goal of the project was to enhance employment prospects for the students.  Students were encouraged to build their evidence of learning and development by means of ‘diary entry’.  The e-portfolio was implemented via SPIDER, a virtual environment developed within the department (http://spider.pharmacy.strath.ac.uk).  The students were provided with support and guidelines around reflection, self-assessment, and self-evaluation.  (Stefani et al., 2007).

2)	'''Alverno (Liberal Arts College for women), the e-portfolio at an institutional level. ''' (http://www.alberno.edu/academics/dpp.html).  Some of the key uses were providing a means for students to record their internships, volunteer, and community service work, and to build a resume.  Allowing students to store multimedia files; audio and video and enabling faculty and students to view it anytime, anywhere they have internet access.  (Stefani et al., 2007).

3)	'''Lifelong E-Folio Minnesota.'''  (http://www.efoliominnesota.com) It is a multimedia first statewide portfolio system that provides all Minnesota residents, including students enrolled in Minnesota schools, educators and others a free life-time e-portfolio with up to 3MB storage space.  (Lorrenzo &amp; Ittelson, 2005).


'''Conclusion'''

There are very promising educational opportunities for e-portfolios across various disciplines, applications, and institutions.  Although many have begun to adopt e-portfolio technology and research on them, they are not mainstream higher educational technology.  Many institutions are still struggling with the implementation of Learning Management systems.  Nevertheless, it is essential to explore this technology as it has the potential to support the varied learning styles of our Digital Natives.  In this era of knowledge economy where most of the future jobs are not yet defined it is critical for students to plan ahead.  E-portfolios basis as a constructivist model of learning further develops students’ reflective practice, goal setting, and self-evaluation and assessment.

      <comment>/* Italian Advances */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== North Africa ==
=== Italian Invasion of Egypt ===
Things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa almost from the start. Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussars had seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya. In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief, General Lastucci. On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and apparent heir to Mussolini, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.

Mussolini ordered Balbo's replacement, Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, to launch an attack into Egypt immediately. Graziani was the commander of the Italian Tenth Army in Libya. He complained to Mussolini that his forces were not properly equipped for such an operation. Graziani further complained that an attack into Egypt could not possibly succeed. Mussolini ordered Graziani to attack anyway.

At the time, General Wavell's Middle East Command included some 36,000 troops (including support and administration units) based within Egypt to defend against 250,000 Italian Invaders. On September 13, a large element of Graziani's Italian Tenth Army re-took Fort Capuzzo and crossed the border between Libya and Egypt. The Italian advance proved to be a struggle. One division got lost, and many engines over-heated. On the opening day of the offensive, the Italians dropped paratroopers into Sollum. The British, being greatly outnumbered, left mines and retreated. After four more days, Graziani halted the advance, citing supply problems. During this time the Italians captured a number of British airfields. Despite Mussolini urging Graziani to continue the advance, the Italians dug in at Sidi Barrani and established several fortified camps. Graziani was now 60 miles in Egypt and 80 miles west of the British defences at Mersa Matruh. He planned to return to the offensive after his troops had been resupplied. During the offensive, 120 Italians and 40 British were killed.

==East Africa ==
=== Italian Advances ===
Starting in June 1940, the Italians tested the resolve of the British and Commonwealth forces along the borders of the Sudan and Kenya and in the shipping lanes of the Red Sea.

On June 13, early in the morning, three Italian Caproni bombers appeared and bombed the Rhodesian air base at the fort located at Wajir in Kenya. The Rhodesian aircraft were still warming up and preparing to take-off on a dawn patrol. The Capronis bombed the fort, the landing-ground, and nearby housing. The King's African Rifles (KAR), then garrisoning the fort, lost four killed and eleven wounded. Two Rhodesian aircraft were badly damaged and a large dump of aviation fuel was set on fire. Following this, the air base at Wajir received regular visits from the Italians every second or third day and the Rhodesian pilots were made to realize the significant shortcomings in speed and fire-power of the Hawker Hardys they themselves flew.

At dawn on June 17, the Rhodesians struck back and supported a successful raid by the KAR on the Italian desert outpost of El Wak in Italian Somaliland, some ninety miles northeast of Wajir. The Rhodesians bombed and set alight the thatched mud huts and generally harassed the enemy troops. But, since the main fighting at that time was centered around Italian advances towards Moyale in Kenya, the Rhodesians concentrated on that town. In conjunction with the South African Air Force, the Rhodesians undertook the task of reconnaissance and bombing in that disputed area.

Early in July, Italian forces in Eritrea crossed the Sudan border and forced the small British garrison holding the railway junction at Kassala to withdraw. The Italians also seized the small British fort at Gallabat, just over the border from Metemma, some 200 miles (320 km) to the south of Kassala. Even the villages of Ghezzan, Kurmuk and Dumbode on the blue Nile were conquered. Having taken Kassala and Gallabat, however, the Italians decided to venture no further - because of lack of fuel - and they proceeded to fortify Kassala with anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts, and strong-points. The Italians sent a brigade-strong garrison to Kassala.

In Kenya, after heavy fighting, the Italians occupied &quot;Fort Harrington&quot; in Moyale. At the end of July, Italian forces reached Debel and Buna. These small villages, nearly one-hundred kilometers from the Ethiopian-Kenyan border, were to be the deepest points inside Kenya reached by the Italian army.

In the first days of August, an Italian force of irregular Eritreans raided Port Sudan as a prelude to the Italian campaign to conquer British Somaliland.

On August 3, 1940, approximately 25,000 Italian troops invaded British Somaliland. The Italians were commanded by General Guglielmo Nasi.

The Italian force attacking British Somaliland in August included five colonial brigades, three Blackshirt battalions, and three bands (banda) of native troops. The Italians had armoured vehicles (a small number of both light and medium tanks), artillery, and, for the moment, superior air support.

The Italians were opposed by a British contingent of about four-thousand men consisting of the Somaliland Camel Corps (commanded by Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater), elements of the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion King's African Rifles (KAR) and the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesian Regiment, the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment, and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch.

The Italians advanced in three columns, with the western column advancing towards Zeila, the central column towards Hargeisa, and the eastern column towards Odweina in the south. Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone commanded the strong central column. Colonel Chater, used his camel corps to skirmish with and screen against the advancing Italians as the other British and Commonwealth forces pulled back towards Tug Argan.

On August 5, within two days of the invasion, the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were taken. The occupation of Zeila effectively sealed British Somaliland off from French Somaliland. Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns combined to launch attacks against the main British and Commonwealth positions at Tug Argan.

On August 7 the British and Commonwealth forces in British Somaliland received reinforcements with the arrival of the 1st Battalion 2nd Punjab Regiment. On August 11, a new commander, Major-General Reade Godwin-Austen, reached Tug Argan.

But, early on August 15, Godwin-Austen concluded that further resistance to the Italians would be futile in Tug Argan. He contacted the British Middle East Command headquarters in Cairo, Egypt. Godwin-Austen requested and received permission to withdraw his forces from British Somaliland. The determined effort of the Black Watch battalion, which covered the retreat, allowed the entire British and Commonwealth contingent to withdraw to Berbera with reduced losses. By August 17, most of the contigent was successfully evacuated from Berbera to Aden. Rather than evacuate, the Somaliland Camel Corps was disbanded.

      <comment>/* Slytherins */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I think it is amazing that J.K. Rowling put the diadem in the 6th book. I mean, no one suspected that an old, &quot;tarnished tiara&quot; could have importance. All the connections and puzzle pieces are amazing.
:The diadem I can see... but the Snitch? Carrying that from the first book all the way to the seventh — '''that's''' a connection. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:11, 6 December 2008 (UTC)

== Slytherins ==

None of the Slytherins being anti-Voldemort is a bit unlikely.Almost as if there is a bad race after all while it would be better if you had found pro-Voldemorts among all houses and anti-Voldemorts in all houses.

:I will mention that Slytherin himself left the school because they would not accept his &quot;pure-bloods only&quot; rule for the entire school. As such, the Sorting Hat will have incorporated, to the best of Gryffindor's ability, Slytherin's biases, so Slytherin House will be predominantly Pure-Blood wizards, many of whom will have the pure-blood bias we see so plainly in the Gaunts, Blacks, and Malfoys. Even in those wizards who are only half Wizard descended, like Snape and Riddle, the Hat will select often on Pure-Blood bias.

:More than that, though, is the idea that a committee (or group) does nothing unless a strong person in the group drives it in his chosen direction. Slytherin will be lead, by OotP, by Draco and Pansy to a large extent; it is always Draco and Pansy who we see initiating things, first in Draco and Harry's shared classes, and later for the whole house. Yes, there likely will be Slytherins who are anti-Voldemort, but they will stay quiet out of fear of being branded &quot;Muggle lovers&quot; and thus Blood traitors.

:The bias towards Slytherin's views does match, almost exactly, a bias towards Voldemort's views, and so Slytherin house would tend to echo Voldemort in any event. Given this perception, even if an anti-Voldemort Slytherin tried to make himself known, no Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff would be likely to believe him. It is this sort of understanding of human nature that makes the books so convincing.

:As for there being no Voldemort sympathizers in other houses, I hold up the example of Peter Pettigrew, a Gryffindor. The fact that none others are named is inconclusive... we do get the feeling that Harry doesn't trust everyone in the DA, and certainly doesn't trust everyone in the school to be anti-Voldemort.

Hi all. I'm interested in working on this wikibook. I am studying Swahili and creating content could be a productive way to study. I've never created wiki content before so this will be a learning experience. Best. --[[User:ThanatosUroboros|ThanatosUroboros]] ([[User talk:ThanatosUroboros|talk]]) 01:29, 24 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Description==

'''Eeschema''' is powerful schematic capture software, available under the following operating systems :

* Linux
* Windows XP/2000

Whatever the system used, the generated files are completely compatible from one system to another.

'''Eeschema''' is “integrated” software because all of the functions of drawing, control, layout, library management and access to the PCB design software are carried out from within Eeschema.

It also allows hierarchical drawings, using multi-sheet diagrams .

It is intended to work with printed circuit software such as PCBNEW, to which it will provide the Netlist file, which describes the electrical connections of the PCB to design.

'''Eeschema''' also integrates a component editor which allows the creation, editing, and visualization of components, as well as the handling of the symbol libraries (Import, export, addition and deletion of library components).

'''Eeschema''' also provides the following additional but essential functions needed for modern schematic capture software :

* Design rules check (D.R.C.) for the automatic control of incorrect connections, the inputs of components left unconnected…
* Export of the layout files to POSTSCRIPT or HPGL format
* Printing the layout files on a local printer.
* Bill of Materials generation.
* Netlist generation for PCB layout or simulation software.

==Technical overview==

This 32 bit software is limited only by the memory size available.

There is thus no real limitation to the component count, number of component pins, connections, sheets…

'''Eeschema''' allows simple or multi sheet diagrams.

In the case of multi sheet diagrams, the representation is hierarchical, and the access to each sheet is then immediate.

'''Eeschema''' use cases for multi sheet diagrams:

Simple hierarchies ( each diagram is used only once)

Complex hierarchies ( some diagram is used more than once (multiple instances) )

Flat hierarchies ( some diagrams not explicitly connected in a master diagram)

The maximum size of the drawings is always adjustable from A4 format to A0 and from A to E format.</text>

=General Commands=

==Access to the commands==
You can reach the various commands by:

* Clicking on the menu bar (top of screen).
* Clicking on the icons on top of the screen (general commands).
* Clicking on the icons on the right side of the screen (particular commands or “tools”).
* Clicking on the icons on the left side of the screen (Display options).
* Clicking on the mouse buttons (important complementary commands). In particular a right click opens a contextual menu, depending on the element under the cursor (Zoom, grid and edition of the elements).
* Function keys of the keyboard: 
**F1, F2, F3, F4, Insert and space keys.
**The “Escape” key often allows the canceling of a command in progress.
**The ”Insert” key allows the duplication of the last element created.


Here are the various possible accesses to the commands.

[[Image:Eeschema_access_to_the_commands.png|center]]

==Commands with the Mouse==
===Basic commands===

'''Left button'''

* Single click : displays the characteristics of the component or text under the cursor.
* Double click: edit (if the element is editable) this component or text.

'''Right button'''

* Opens a pop-up menu.

===Operations on blocks===
You can move, drag, copy and delete selected areas in all Eeschema menus.

Areas are selected with the left mouse button. The command is completed with the release of the button.

By holding one of the keys “Shift”, “Ctrl”, or the 2 keys “Shift and Ctrl”, during selection this results in the copying, dragging or deletion of the selected area.


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|+ '''Command Summary'''
|-
| Left mouse button || Move selection
|-
| Shift + left mouse button || Copy selection
|-
| Ctrl + left mouse button || Drag selection
|-
| Control + Shift + left mouse button || Delete selection
|}


The command is executed at button release.

During selection move :

* Click again to place back the elements.
* Click right button to cancel.

If a move bloc command has started, an other command bloc can be slecteted by Pop Up menu (mouse, right button)


==Hot keys==
The hot keys are not case sensitive.

* The ? key displays the current hot keys list.
* The Preference menu manage the hot keys.

The hot keys can be programmed by users

To do it:

# Create or recreate the hotkey file
# Edit the file (it is commented).
# In order to use the new hot keys setup, Reread the hotkeys config file (or re-run '''EESchema''').


==Selecting the grid size==
The cursor moves on a grid, which can be displayed or not (this grid is always displayed in the library management menus ).

You can change the grid size via the pop-up menu or the Preferences/Options menu.

The default grid size is 50 mil (0.050 &quot;) or 1,27 millimeters.

One can also work with the average (20 mil) or fine grid(10 mil).

This is not recommended for usual work.

This average or fine grid is especially intended to design or handle components with large numbers of pins (several hundreds).

==Selecting Zoom==
To change “Zoom”:

* Right click to open the Pop-up menu and select the desired zoom.
* Or use the function keys:
** F1: Zoom in
** F2: Zoom out
** F3: Redraw
** F4: Center around the cursor, or simple click on the mouse middle button (without moving the mouse)
* Window Zoom: Mouse drag, with the middle button.
** Mouse weel: Zoom in / Zoom out
** SHIFT+Mouse weel: Up/down panning
** CTRL+Mouse weel: Left/Right panning

==Displaying the coordinates of the cursor==
The display units are in inches (inch or “) or millimeters.

However, '''Eeschema''' always works internally with 1/1000 of an inch.

The following information is displayed at the bottom right hand side of the window :

* The zoom factor.
* The absolute position of the cursor.
* The relative position of the cursor.
* The relative co-ordinates (x, y) can be reset with the space bar.
* The coordinates posted will then relate to this point.


==Menu Bars==
This menu allows the opening and saving of schematics, the program configuration, and it also contains the help menu.


==Upper toolbar==
This toolbar gives access to the main functions of '''EESchema'''.


Create a new schematic.

Open a schematic.	

Save complete schematic (with the whole hierarchy).

Select the sheet size and title block editing.

Call component editor Libedit (Examination, modification, and editing of library components).

Display libraries (Viewlib).

Call the “navigator”, to display the tree structure of the diagram hierarchy (if it contains sub sheets) and the immediate selection of any sheet of the hierarchy.

Remove the selected elements during a move block.

Copy selected elements in the clipboard during a move block.

Copy last selected element or block in the current sheet.

Undo: Cancel the last change (up to 10 levels).

Redo (up to 10 levels).

Open print menu.

Call CVPCB.	

Call PCBNEW.

Zoom in and out, around the center of screen.	

Redraw of the screen and optimal Zoom.	

Call the menu of components localization and texts.

Creation of the netlist (Pcbnew , Spice .... format).

Component annotation.

ERC (Electrical Rules Check) : automatic checking of electrical connections.

Generate the BOM (Bill of materials) and/or hierarchical labels.

Import a stuff file from Cvpcb (fill the footprint field of components)


==Right toolbar icons==
This toolbar  gives access to tools for:

- Component placement, wires and buses, junctions, labels,texts…

- Navigation in the sheets hierarchy.

- Creation of hierarchical subsheets and connection symbols.

- Component deletion.


The detailed use of these tools is described in the chapter “ Diagram Creation/Editing”.

'''An outline of their use is given below.'''

Stop the order or tool in progress.

Navigation in the hierarchy: this tool makes it possible to open the subsheet of the displayed schematic (click in the symbol of this subsheet), or to go back up in the hierarchy (click in a free area of the subsheet)

Call the component placement menu.

&quot;Powers&quot; placement menu.

Wire placement.

Bus placement.

Wire to bus connections. These elements have only a decorative role and do not allow connection; thus they should not be used for connections between wires.

Bus to bus connections. They can only connect two buses between themselves.

“No connection” symbols. These are to be placed on component pins which are not to be connected. This is useful in the ERC function to check if pins are intentionally left not connected or are missed.

Local label placement. Two wires may be connected with identical labels in the same sheet. For connections between two different sheets,you have to use global symbols.

Global label placement. This makes it possible to place a connection between a subsheet and the root sheet which contains the subsheet symbol.

Junction placement. To connect two crossing wires, or a wire and a pin, when it can be ambiguous. (i.e. if an end of the wire or pin is not connected to one of the ends of the other wire).

Hierarchical label placement. This makes it possible to place a connection between a sheet and the root sheet which contains this sheet symbol.

Hierarchical subsheet symbol placement (resizable rectangle). You have to specify the file name to save the data of this “subsheet”.

Global label importation from subsheet, in order to create a connection on a subsheet symbol. Global labels are supposed to be already placed in this subsheet.

For this hierarchy symbol, the created connection points are equivalent to a traditional component pin, and must be wired.

Global label creation in subsheets to create connection points. This function is similar to the previous one which does not require already defined global symbols.

Lines for framings… Only decorative, and does not perform a connection.

Placement of comment text. Only decorative.

Delete selected element.

if several superimposed elements are selected, the priority is given to the smallest (in the decreasing priorities : junction, NoConnect, wire, bus, text, component). This also applies to hierarchical sheets. Note: the “Undelete” function of the general toolbar allows you to cancel last deletions.</text>

*Typically monoarticular
*Young and middle-aged adults
*Not clear whether it is a chronic inflammatory process or a neoplastic process
*Work-up MRI, though presence of hemosiderin may overestimate size of lesion
*Primary treatment is surgical resection, although complete resection may be difficult to obtain
*Adjuvant therapy may include radioactive isotopse (Y90) or external beam RT
*For EBRT, University of Florida review recommends 35 Gy in 14-15 fractions

==Translation==

'''Readings from the Dao De Jing (道德经)'''

&lt;u&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/u&gt;

There are ways but the way is uncharted; There are names but not nature in words; Nameless indeed is the source of creation but things have a mother and she has a name. The secret waits for the insight; Of eyes unclouded by longing; Those who are bound by desire see only the outward container. These two come paired but distinct by their names. Of all things profound, say that their pairing is deepest, the gate to the root of the world.


&lt;u&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/u&gt;

Since the world points up beauty as such, there is ugliness too. If goodness is taken as goodness, wickedness enters as well. For is and is-not come together; Hard and easy are complementary; Long and short are relative; High and low are comparative; Pitch and sound make harmony; Before and after are a sequence. Indeed the Wise Man's office is to work by being still; he teaches not by speech but by accomplishment; he does for everything, neglecting none; Their life he gives to all, possessing none; And what he brings to pass depends on no one else. As he succeeds, he takes no credit and just because he does not take it, credit never leaves him.


&lt;u&gt;Chapter 4&lt;/u&gt;

The Way is a void, used but never filled: An abyss it is, like an ancestor from which all things come. It blunts sharpness, resolves tangles; It tempers light, subdues turmoil. A deep pool it is, never to run dry! Whose offspring it may be I do not know: It is like a preface to God.


&lt;u&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/u&gt;

Is then the world unkind? And does it treat all things like straw dogs used in magic rites? The Wise Man too, is he unkind? And does he treat the folk like straw dogs made to throw away? Between the earth and sky the space is like a bellows, empty but unspent. When moved its gift is copious. Much talk means much exhaustion; better far it is to keep your thoughts!


&lt;u&gt;Chapter 11&lt;/u&gt;

Too much colour blinds the eye, Too much music deafens the ear, Too much taste dulls the palate, Too much play maddens the mind, Too much desire tears the heart. In this manner the sage cares for people: He provides for the belly, not for the senses; He ignores abstraction and holds fast to substance.

**pinch mixed herbs (optional)
**milk or egg to glaze

== Preparation ==
#Pre-heat the oven to 190ºC (370ºF or gas mark 5)
#Divide the pastry into two equal portions, roll it out and line a 20 cm (8 inch) oven proof dish with one portion
#Add the bacon to the eggs and mix. The bacon can be fried or grilled if preferred
#Add any seasoning or herbs
#Now pour the mixture from step 4 into the dish. Moisten the edge of the pastry then cover the dish with the second portion of pastry
#Seal the edges. Make a small hole in the centre to allow steam to escape. The pastry can be brushed with a beaten egg or milk to improve the browning.
#Bake for about 35-40 minutes.

First enter the text of the question in the '''Question Body''' text box and then enter the options from which the quiz taker will have to choose.  You can enter up to 99 options.  '''Remember''' you must check the box beside the correct option.   Only one option can be correct for a Multiple Choice Question and the user will either get full marks for a correct answer or no marks for an incorrect answer.

Select '''Individual Option Feedback''' to give the quiz-taker feedback that is specific to the option selected.

As with the multiple choice question, you enter a range of answers for the quiz taker to choose from.  This time there can be more than one correct answer.  '''Remember''' to tick all the answers that are correct. The quiz-taker only receives points if he selects all the answers that are correct - otherwise he gets no points. If you want to award points for a partially correct answer, use the [[../Partial Credit/]] question.

For this type of question you can input a range of possible correct answers.  For example if there are abbreviations commonly used you can include them, with all possible varieties of punctuation - if Saint Peter was the answer, you could allow for St Peter; Saint Peter; and St. Peter.

In the Question Options properties window you can opt to require that the [[../../Quiz Options/Question Options/Fill in the Blank Question Options|capitalization]] of the answer be correct.

You can change the length of the &quot;blank&quot; by adding as many underscores _______ as you need.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; | In addition if have you the latest Professional Version of Question Writer you can opt to allow some error and to award full or partial marks to students who come close enough.  You can specify how close by changing the %error allowed.  The default setting is 30%, meaning 3 errors in a 10 letter word or 1 in a 4 letter word.

An error can be one of the following:
# Wrong letter (Necessery)
# Missing letter (Necesary)
# Extra letter (Neccessary)
# Two letters switched around (Recieve)
# Where case-correct answers are required, switching the case of a letter is also marked as a single error. (washington)

[[Image:QW3Seq preview.png|center]]

In this type of question you will be asking the quiz taker to place a selection of statements in the correct order.  You should be sure that there is only one correct order (unlike the example!).    The quiz taker will be able to drag and drop the answers into a grid.


[[Image:QW3Sequence.png|center]]

You can opt to award marks only to quiz-takers who get the entire sequence correct - or you can award partial credit where some pairs have been correctly sequenced relative to each other.
[[../../Quiz Options/Advanced Settings/Question Scoring|Question Scoring Options]]

See the Question Writer Blog article for detailed information on how the partial credit scoring works with Sequencing Questions. [http://www.questionwriterblog.com/archives/2008/02/sequencing_question.html]

In this question type you can ask the quiz taker to write a short Essay.  The subject of the essay is described in the Question Body box and you can limit the height of the text box entering the number of lines. Essay questions are not automatically scored and so the feedback for these questions is limited to a single piece of text, written in advance. You can switch this feedback off by unticking '''Display Feedback Page for Essay Questions''' in [[../../Quiz Options/Other Labels|Quiz Options - Other Labels]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Matching==

With this type of question you are asking the quiz taker to match pairs; for example countries and capital cities or heroes and heroines.  The quiz taker will be able to drop and drag one element of the pair to make the match.

 [[Image:QW3Matching.png|center]]

You can opt to award marks only to quiz-takers who get the all the matches correct - or you can award partial credit proportional to how many correct matches have been made.

You can also limit the number of matches that are displayed each time a questions is used.  This is useful if you have a large data set and a single question showing all the possible matches would not be feasible.  You can use this feature to limit the number of matches and then reuse the question either in the same quiz or in a different quiz.  This example [[http://www.questionwritertracker.com/quiz/11679/Q49MG7WY.html]] contains all 50 US states and capitals but you could also for example use this feature for periodic table symbol questions or indeed for any other large datasets.

The Partial Credit question type is a powerful multiple choice question that allows you to specify the number of points awarded for each option and also the number of answer options that the quiz taker can choose.  This allows you to award partial credit for partially correct answers and implement negative marking schemes to discourage quiz-takers from guessing answers.

For more information see [[../Scoring Questions/]] and [[../../Quiz Options/Question Options/Question Scoring Options|Question Scoring Options]] in Quiz Set Up.{{clr}}

Metadata is data about data.  It is useful if you are organising a lot of questions, you can use metadata to describe each question.  You can '''add''' Metadata to any question by right clicking while your mouse is over the question in the Action Pane and selecting the add option.  The metadata properties window will open and you can add four metadata elements to the question:

*Title
*Description
*Identifier
*Keywords

The question will then appear with the blue circle '''information''' icon below it in the quiz tree.{{clr}}
|}


[[Image:QW3Pro Metadata.jpg|center]]

The Title you use in the metadata will be used as an identifier for the question in the Question Writer Tracker as well as when setting conditions to evaluate scores for [[Question Writer Manual/About Questions/Question Evaluation|Custom Feedback]].

The '''Explanation''' question is not really a question type.  You can use it to add text and/or an image to a page in the quiz, without needing to have an interactive element of score.  This is useful if you want to:

*add an introduction or explanation to a section
*give the quiz taker a break in the middle of a long quiz, or
*provide some reading material for a comprehension question{{clr}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Scoring Questions==

As you enter each question you can assign the points awarded for that question.  This allows you to apply a different weighting to each question.  You can also choose whether or not to display the points awarded for each question in [[Question Writer Manual/Quiz Options/Question Options/General Question Properties|Quiz Options - Question Options - General Question Properties]].

You set the pass score for the quiz as a percentage of the overall mark by entering the percentage as a number in the [[../../Quiz Options/Quiz Details|Quiz Details]] properties.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |
Partial Credit style questions allow you to assign different points for different answer options.  Negative points for answer options can also be awarded this way. You can also choose whether those negative points are set against  the overall points for a quiz by checking the '''Allow Overall Negative Marks''' box in the [[../../Quiz Options/Question Options/Question Scoring Options|Question Scoring Options]] section of Question Options in the Quiz properties. &lt;br&gt;

Partial credit scoring can also be used with Matching and Sequencing questions to allow you to award partial credit for partially correct answers in these question types. The partial credit scoring for Matching questions is straightforward enough - it is proportional to the number of correct matches the quiz-takers makes.

When Partial Credits are applied to sequencing questions you can give most of the marks where the quiz-taker knows the basics and extra credit for those fully in command of the topic.  The scoring is based on correct relative pairs; the number of possible pairs depends on the number of elements or choices.  If you have 6 elements you will have 15 possible relative pairs.  The scoring works by subtracting the number of incorrect pairs from the number of correct pairs and maps it to the number of points available for the question.  The mark is given rounded to the nearest whole number.  For more detail on how this works see the February 2008 blog posting[http://www.questionwriterblog.com/archives/2008/02/].


===Multiple Scores===
Question Writer 4 lets you define multiple scores for all question types - except Explanation or Essay type questions where there is no automatic scoring.  You can use this to show the scores for different topics within a quiz or keep track of different factors in a Myers-Briggs type questionnaire.

Right click on a question to add one or more scores to the question and give the score a name in the properties box.  Question Writer will track the overall score for the quiz but you will also be able to reference scores defined by name when showing feedback or displaying scores on screen.


[[File:QW Multiple score.jpg|center]]

Scores can also be evaluated according to your set conditions and [[Question Writer Manual/About Questions/Question Evaluation|Custom Feedback]] can be shown according to the values of different scores.

You can read some more about multiple scores in this August 2011 blog article.[[http://www.questionwriter.com/blog/multiple-score-tracking.html]]{{clr}}

= Scotch Gambit =
Black can continue the Scotch with 4...Bc5 5.c3 and now 5...Nf6 will transpose into a safe variation of the Giuoco Piano. Alternatively, he can transpose into the Two Knights Defense with 4...Nf6 and White has now two sound options: the obvious 5. e5 and 5. O-O. In the first case 5. e5 white goes for maintaining a strong center and an open game with chances for both sides. 5. O-O gives away the pawn, and while taking it might seem risky due to 6.. Re1 it's perfectly sound, and white will only get his pawn back.

Black can instead accept the gambit with 5...dxc3 but this is riskier because White will gain a lead in development. A possible continuation is 6.Nxc3 (Grandmaster Sveshnikov has played 6.Bxf7+!? Kxf7 7.Qd5+ followed by 8.Qxc5) 6...d6 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Nd5 Nge7 9.Qc3 0-0.''Göring Gambit'''. This gambit is quite similar to the [[wikipedia:Danish Gambit|Danish Gambit]].

===Uses===

'''Template name:Image2ontop'''
Makes a three columned table and places the Table of Contents, (TOC), in it.   Allows two separate images with captions to be placed to its right, level with the top of the TOC.   Saves space and looks better than the large expanse of white space which usually exists to the right of the TOC.

Because the TOC text can vary and because the TOC has its own internal sizing algorithm, a ''widthleft'' option is provided to adjust the width of the leftmost cell, if necessary.

Note that the table can be placed ''anywhere'' on the page, so text could exist above it.   To reduce any excessive gap between such text and the images, consider placing the template in-line with the end of the top text.

===Limitations===
----
I cannot figure out how to fully manage the mind of the TOC so the ''widthleft'' option was found necessary to ''unwrap'' TOC entries on occasion.

Images vary in size so it is important to select images of about the right shape before scaling.   Scale the images to the same height if possible by specifying the height of each exactly and exaggerating the width to a considerable extent.   In this way the software picks the least size to match the specification, which will be the one you want.   [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Pictures/Tiled_Images '''Tiled Images'''] contains further examples of such scaling, but see the code below for a typical example which can be run in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Sandbox&amp;action=submit '''sandbox'''].   (You will need to type a few dummy headings there to generate the Table of Contents.)

{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{image2ontop|[[Image:Narcissus pseudonarcissus (daffodills) - 1.jpg|900x230px]]|Caption 1|[[image:crocus_4.jpg|1000x230px]]|Caption 2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

Provision for ''two'' images is made, but '''if captions are not needed, use &lt;nowiki&gt;template:textontop&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' with images scaled and in-line  within the text space.   In this way, a variable number of images could be included. 

===Parameters===
----
There are four parameters; left image code, left caption, right image code, and right caption.  

===Options===
----
;widthleft:   width of the leftmost table cell, with the Table of Contents, (TOC).Default 200px.
;cp: all-round cell padding, default 5px
;background: background color, default transparent.
;border: perimeter border, default none.

Provision for ''three'' images is made, but '''if captions are not needed, use &lt;nowiki&gt;template:textontop&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' with images scaled and in-line  within the text space.   In this way, a variable number of images could be included. 

===Parameters===
----
There are six parameters;
;1:   Image 1 code, for example: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:A_sunflower.jpg|1000x220px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
;2:   caption 1, any text or text template eg; &lt;nowiki&gt;Template: Caption&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
;3:   image 2 code
;4:   caption 2
;5:   image 3 code
;6:   caption 3

===Options===
----
;widthleft:   width of the leftmost table cell, with the Table of Contents, (TOC).Default 200px.
;background: background color, default transparent
;cp: all-round cell padding, default 5px

'''Introduction'''

The Internet has heightened global communication. And with this heightened communication has come an emphasis on socialization resulting in the emergence of a number of active communities whose purpose is to collaboratively and freely create, share, and distribute useful resources, knowledge, artifacts, processes and the like. A prime example is the emergence of the open source community, which freely, openly, and collaboratively creates highly functional and useful software. Another example is the emergence of the Open Educational Resource (OER) community, which borrows much of its philosophical underpinnings from the open source community. The OER community freely, openly, and collaboratively creates credible, useful learning resources. This short chapter introduces interested readers to OERs; specifically, what they are, their ontogeny, some current examples of implementation, and some issues, challenges, and trends facing the OER community.


'''What are OERs?'''

Jan Hylén (2005) suggests the most widely used OER definition is as follows: “Open Educational Resources are digitized materials offered freely and openly for educators, students and self-learners to use and re-use for teaching, learning and research.” 

Further, Hylén suggests an OER is comprised of three things:
# Learning Content;
# Tools;
# Implementation Resources.

Learning content consists of a wide range of digital learning materials from full courses to modules to small knowledge assets. These materials could be in single mode form, such as textual material, or multimodal form, such as audio, video, and textual material. Further, these materials could be comprised of static knowledge objects such as electronic textbooks and web pages, or dynamic knowledge objects such as animations, simulations, and games.

OER tools refer to software and systems for authoring, repurposing, using, sharing, and distributing learning content. These tools include authoring tools for creating learning materials, search engines for locating learning resources, content repositories for storing learning materials, learning management systems for organized distribution of learning materials, and social networking tools for establishing online learning communities related to OERs.

Implementation resources refer to the licenses, such as Creative Commons licensing (see Liang, 2004, pp. 78-85), that enable publication and distribution of OERs while taking into consideration intellectual property and copyright. As well, implementation resources comprise support materials to help producers design effective learning content, and to help learners use learning content most appropriately.

OERs are dependent on three principles:
# Openness;
# Free availability;
# Customizability.

Openness is a measure of the accessibility of OERs. Ideally, OERs should be accessible to all who wish to use them and have as few restrictions attached to them as possible. Free availability infers that OERs should be made available without cost. Customizability entitles users to repurpose (should they wish to do so) pre-existing OERs to meet specific, local needs, and in some cases make derivative works.

Generally, OERs are created to meet specific, local needs, but then are made available for others to adapt should they wish to do so. The result is an ongoing collection of user-generated resources that are collaboratively and continuously developed, used, altered, redeveloped, and reused. Bruns (2007) refers to this continuous, user-led, collaborative cycle as “produsage”. 

OERs are content objects. They do not represent the full teaching and learning experience as there are many other elements that go into the design of learning, such as the pedagogical principles used and the assessment strategies employed. Teachers and self-directed learners may use OERs, but each makes decisions about when, how, and in what context OERs are used, or how chosen OERs may be altered to meet specific needs. In other words, a course is more than just its content.


'''Ontogeny of OERs'''

According to Wiley (2006), the concept of OERs evolved, initially, from the concept of learning objects. Wiley suggests learning objects made popular the notion that digital learning materials could be developed with reuse and reapplication in mind. In the mid to late 1990s the open source software movement emerged as a legitimate alternative model to proprietary software development. Wiley speculated that the principles of open source could be applied to content and as such coined the term “open content” (in 1998) to represent this possibility. Thus the principles of openness and free availability become established with respect to digital learning materials. In 2001 Creative Commons licensing was developed by Larry Lessig (Wiley, 2006). Creative Commons licensing made it possible to distribute user generated digital learning materials while still respecting intellectual property and copyright. The result was a more credible, legal, and flexible licensing structure. Included in the licensing structure was a provision to allow derivative works, which made customization of created content a possibility. As such, the principle of OER customizability became established. UNESCO became interested in open, freely available, and customizable learning materials to help meet the educational needs of all humanity, particularly the developing world. A forum was held in 2002 by UNESCO which resulted in the adoption of the term “Open Educational Resources” to describe such learning materials.


'''OER Project Examples'''

The number of OER projects and initiatives is growing steadily worldwide. Some examples include:

# The OpenCourseWare (OCW) Consortium (http://www.ocwconsortium.org/): In 2001 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced that it would attempt to make the content of its courses freely available online for public, noncommercial use. Since then many institutions worldwide have followed suit. The result is the OCW Consortium, which acts as a portal to a variety of OCW. More than 200 institutions from around the world are currently members of the Consortium. Membership requires institutions to publish at least 10 courses for free, public access. The goals of the Consortium are to:
#* Extend the reach and impact of open courseware by encouraging the adoption and adaptation of open educational materials around the world.
#* Foster the development of additional open courseware projects.
#* Ensure the long-term sustainability of open courseware projects by identifying ways to improve effectiveness and reduce costs. (“OCW Consortium”, n.d.).
# MERLOT (http://www.merlot.org/): Multimedia Educational Resources for Learning and Online Teaching is a learning object repository containing the metadata and links to a number of learning objects in a variety of discipline areas. (Note: MERLOT does not house the learning objects; its database contains metadata and links to contributed learning objects. As such, it is more aptly described as a “referatory” rather than a repository.) Access to the resources is free. Membership is also free. Members may contribute learning materials and create personal collections. MERLOT includes a provision to allow peer review of contributed learning objects.
# Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org/): Wikipedia is a web application that allows users to contribute reference material as well as edit and append existing contributions. The result is a collaboratively developed, dynamic, freely accessible, freely available, extensive collection of encyclopedic reference material. The Wiki phenomenon has spawned a number of sister OER projects including WikiEducator and Wikibooks.
# Open Learning Initiative (OLI) (http://www.cmu.edu/oli/): Developed at Carnegie Mellon, the goal of the OLI project is “… to help the World Wide Web make good on its promise of widely accessible and effective online education.” (n.d.). The result is a number of open and free online courses which anyone may take.
# Rice Connexions (http://cnx.org/): The Connexions web site describes its philosophical make-up as follows: “Connexions is an environment for collaboratively developing, freely sharing, and rapidly publishing scholarly content on the Web. Our Content Commons contains educational materials for everyone — from children to college students to professionals — organized in small modules that are easily connected into larger collections or courses. All content is free to use and reuse under the Creative Commons ‘attribution’ license.” (n.d.).
# OER Commons (http://www.oercommons.org/): The Open Educational Resources Commons is an online portal designed “To provide a single point of access through which educators, students, and all learners can search, browse, evaluate, download, and discuss open educational resources (OER) that are freely available online.” (n.d.). OER Commons houses a number of learning resources (from Kindergarten through to college) in a variety of disciplines.
# OpenContent (http://www.opencontent.org/): OpenContent is a portal with links to a variety of resources, including a blog and wiki, related to open content.
# CLEA (http://open.senecac.on.ca/clea/): Create Learn Engage Activities on the Web is a web application that allows registered users to author and publish online learning activities. Further, authors have the option to allow their activities to be copied, edited and republished by others. Registration is free. Non registered users can still access and use all the learning activities made available by the various authors for free.


'''Issues, Challenges, Trends'''

At the core of the OER movement is the issue of openness. There remains the question as to whether a culture of openness is something that will be embraced more fully, or be adopted by only a few. On one hand advocates argue that openness is the only way to the future, particularly for publicly funded institutions. For example, Wiley (2007) suggests that OERs will become a service provided by higher education in order to maintain competitiveness. On the other hand some argue that there is no clear understanding of what “open” means and what the implications of adopting an open philosophy may be (Downes, 2006). For example, there is a sense that the attractiveness of an open philosophy will mean many will use, but few will contribute. The ambiguity of the term “open” is expected as the OER community is in its relative infancy; nonetheless, working out what openness will come to represent is a challenge for the future.

Another challenge facing the OER community is the issue of sustainability. Wiley (2007) defines sustainability in an OER context as “an open educational resources project’s ongoing ability to meet its goals.” In order to maintain momentum, meet respective goals – and to survive – a number of OER projects have adopted a wide range of sustainability models. Downes (2006) lists a number of these broken down into funding, technical, content, and staffing models. It appears there is no single, reliable solution to the sustainability challenge and that in order to expand the breadth, depth, and reach of OERs, a number of different sustainability models will need to be entertained, each unique to the local needs of a project. Downes (2006) suggests the way forward is to find ways for producers and consumers of OERs to do things for themselves. Further, he suggests that ”… the sustainability of OERs … requires that we think of OERs as only part of a larger picture, one that includes volunteers and incentives, community and partnerships, co-production and sharing, distributed management and control.”

At the Expert Meeting on Open Educational Resources held in Sweden in February, 2006, four sessions were held on key OER topics. Session 1 dealt with Intellectual Property Rights and Licenses for Open Content. A key issue was the need for flexible, easy-to-use and implement licensing in order to combat the restrictive licensing automatically attached to created works, while still respecting copyright, intellectual property and moral rights. One example of Open Content licensing is Creative Commons licensing. Fitzgerald (2007) concludes that “… open content licensing will provide a vitally important facility for sharing and reshaping knowledge in the name of culture, education and innovation.” Session 2 dealt with Developments and Trends in the Field of Open Educational Resources. Key findings included the need to localize content, to reach a critical mass of users not just content, and to establish a research agenda around OERs. Session 3 dealt with Arguments for Institutional Participation in OERs. It was suggested that participation in OER initiatives was “the right thing to do” as it speeds up innovation, fosters social equity, and promotes social responsibility. Session 4 dealt with Models for Sustainable Open Educational resources. Two approaches to sustainability were discussed. The first centred on the institutional model, which approached the production and distribution of OERs from a centralized perspective. The second approach centred on the community model, which approached the production, distribution, and use of OERs from a decentalized perspective. These approaches co-exist and require different models to sustain themselves and to scale to meet the needs of users.


'''Conclusion'''

Tim O’Reilly (1999) in Lessons from Open-Source Software Development asked: “And as the Internet, rather than the desktop, becomes the focus for new applications, do current open-source projects teach principles of large-scale collaborative work that can be applied fruitfully to endeavors other than software development?” One possibility is Open Educational Resources (OERs). The OER movement is still relatively new and key challenges of scalability and sustainability need to be resolved; however, momentum is building. A promising way forward is The Cape Town Open Education Declaration. This declaration represents a statement of principle and community action. The first paragraph of the declaration states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are on the cusp of a global revolution in teaching and learning. Educators worldwide are developing a vast pool of educational resources on the Internet, open and free for all to use. These educators are creating a world where each and every person on earth can access and contribute to the sum of all human knowledge. They are also planting the seeds of a new pedagogy where educators and learners create, shape and evolve knowledge together, deepening their skills and understanding as they go (2007).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The full potential of OERs is to create, in essence, the great equalizer that makes knowledge available for all. The future holds the answer as to whether the full potential of OERs will become realized.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
What is a drug? Why do people take drugs? What are the effects drugs have on the body? This book will serve to answer questions, give facts, and dispel persistent rumors spread about drugs.  First we need to describe what the word &quot;drugs&quot; refers to.

== What are drugs? ==
Colloquially, drugs often refer to illicit drugs. More broadly, a drug is any chemical substance that, when absorbed into the body of a living organism, alters normal bodily function. Of course this covers all medical drugs, from aspirin and penicillin to heroin and arsenic.  

This book will focus on primarily drugs used outside of medical need. These are, generally speaking, psychoactive drugs which taken for any other reason than medical benefit. 

'''Recreational drug use''' is the use of chemical substances for enjoyment or entertainment purposes. Due to lack of cultural background, weak social support, technological alteration of natural occurring compounds for potency or profit and no control about product quality, consumer age limits or mental state, this practice can be extremely dangerous, leading to death, damage to self and dependency.

'''Religious drug use''' is the use of chemical substances in religious rites or with religious connotations, practiced by Native-Americans and South American tribes. Due to the high level of understanding and experience, these culture have in handling the naturally occurring compounds, there is a low risk involved, some of the practices can even aid in correcting dependencies on other substances.

'''Cultural and creative use''' due the effect of some of the drugs in brain chemistry some people rely in drugs to augment creative capability and establish new paths for problem solving and self understanding. Can lead to drug abuse and dependency.

'''Functional use''' some drugs are used to temporarily or permanently alter physical or mental limitations. This can also lead to drug abuse and dependency.

Notice that we do not use the term &quot;illegal drug&quot;.  There are several reasons for this.  First the definition of what is legal varies from country to country.  Secondly some drugs that are abused, taken at levels beyond the recommended dosages, or even prescribed medically or sold over the counter lead to addiction and are legal drugs. Drug use is generally regulated for the safety of the public, but the exact legal status of any substance is dependent on country and/or jurisdiction and political and religions positions.

* A psychoactive drug is '''any''' substance that alters your perception or senses.
* A addiction causing drug is '''any''' substance that creates physical or psychological dependency in its use.

      <comment>/* Deliriants */ corrected &quot;differs&quot; to &quot;differentiates&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hallucinogens''' are drugs that alter sensory input to the brain. This creates an altered sense of reality, as well as a change in emotions and thought patterns. Hallucinogens can connect the three forms of the psyche, delivering thoughts and feelings that would normally remain only subconscious. It is because of this that hallucinogens can cause life-changing experiences.

Hallucinogens are divided into 3 categories - [[#Psychedelics|Psychedelics]], [[#Dissociatives|Dissociatives]], and [[#Deliriants|Deliriants]]

====Psychedelics====
Psychedelics are distinguished from the other two subclasses by their lack of addicting qualities, and the remarkable experiences one often has under their influences. Most (but not all) psychedelics are non-toxic and have a very high [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/LD50|LD50]]. This means that the user would have to ingest or take very large amounts of the drug, many times that of a recreational dose, in order to kill themselves. The experiences, however, can sometimes be extremely overwhelming, driving users to seek emergency assistance. It is strongly recommended that there be a sober sitter to watch over users, especially first-timers.

Most psychedelics work by interacting with serotonin and serotonin receptors in the brain. Effects include increased breathing and heartrate, dilated pupils, dehydration, increased color perception, a state of empathetic well-being (feeling as if though one is at peace with everyone and everything), and visual distortion: things may appear to move, shapes appear on textures and exhibit a kaleidoscope-like effect, lighting dramatically changes for no apparent reason.

Despite their non-toxicity, many psychedelics are known for the nausea, and in some cases vomiting, that they may cause.

Primary psychedelics include Indoles (Tryptamines, Lysergamides, Ibogoids) and certain Phenethylamines.

=====Tryptamines=====
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Mushrooms|Psilocybin and Psilocin (Magic Mushrooms, Shrooms)]]
''The proceeding 4 drugs all have a 5-Methoxy N,N analogue that effectively increases the potency of the drug''
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/DMT|Dimethyltryptamine (DMT)]], and chemically similar drugs
*Dipropyltryptamine (DPT), and chemically similar drugs
*Diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), and chemically similar drugs
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/aMT|Alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT)]], and chemically similar drugs
There are literally thousands of possible Methyltryptamines, but their effects are usually very similar to the four above.

=====Lysergamides=====
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/LSD|Lysergic acid Diethylamide (LSD)]]
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/LSA|Lysergic acid Amide (LSA)]]

=====Ibogoids=====
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Ibogaine|Ibogaine]] (Also used to treat severe opiate addiction)

=====Psychedelic Phenethylamines=====
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Mescaline|Mescaline]], the primary active drug in psychedelic cacti
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/2C|The 2C Drug Class]], a collection of numerous synthetic drugs created by [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Alexander Shulgin|Alexander Shulgin]]

=====Psychedelic Amphetamines=====
*2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM, STP), similar to [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/LSD|LSD]] in effects, with a much longer duration)
*2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine (DOB), similar to [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/2C|2C]] class drugs
*2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI), similar to [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/2C|2C]] class drugs
*Bromo-DragonFLY, possibly the most potent hallucinogen alongside [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/LSD|LSD]]

----

Secondary Psychedelics mix the effects of [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Stimulants|Stimulants]] and Hallucinogens. They tend to lack the intense visual effects that most other psychedelics have, and instead replace it with a more empathic feeling of well-being and happiness.

=====Empathogens=====
These drugs cause the brain to release excess amounts of seretonin, and can cause hangovers where the user feels depressed and fatigued the day after use. This can lead to a strong psychological addiction. It is strongly recommended that users allow their bodies to recover for several weeks between uses.

*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/MDMA|Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy)]]
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/MDA|Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA)]], similar to MDMA, though less potent and with more visual effects

=====Cannabinoids=====
Cannabinoids are a unique class of drugs. Although subclassed as a psychedelic, cannabinoids exhibit features of all three classes of drugs. Cannabinoids are created naturally by the body and regulate a large number of body functions. It is because of this that they have several medical uses, from pain relief, to appetite stimulation, to anti-nauseants.

*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Marijuana|Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Cannabis, Marijuana)]]
*[http://www.urinetesting101.com/ Marijuana Tests]

Several synthetic and extremely potent cannabinoids exist, and are now documented for killing brain cells and stopping neuron growth.

====Dissociatives====

Dissociatives are a subclass of hallucinogens that work by blocking or altering sensory perception (Including senses that are perceived by the unconscious mind), creating a feeling of disconnection and depersonalization from one's body and reality, but also leading to some uncomfortable side effects. Many dissociatives are strong depressants as well, and large doses can slow down the heart or breathing to the point of death. Generally they are not physically addicting, but can be habit forming if used repeatedly in a short time span. Because of this, it is recommended that users give their body at least a week between uses to heal.

The experience on most dissociatives is described as being dream-like. Like with [[#Psychedelics|Psychedelics]], a mixing of the senses can lead users to believe they can see sounds, or taste textures. However, hallucinations are uncommon, but can be achieved in dark areas.

Primary dissociatives are NMDA antagonists.

=====NDMA Antagonists=====
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/DXM|Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide/Polistirex (DXM)]], found in most OTC cough suppressants, most popularly, Robitussin
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Ketamine|Ketamine]]
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/PCP|Phenylcyclohexylpiperidine (PCP, Angel Dust)]], a drug rumoured to cause violent actions in normally non-aggressive individuals
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Ibogaine|Ibogaine]], also a [[#Psychedelic|Psychedelic]]
*Tiletamine, a non-recreational tranquilizer

=====Kappa Opioid Receptor Agonists=====
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Salvia|Salvinorin-A, and lesser C (Salvia divinorum)]], the most potent naturally occurring substance known to man (potency referring to the minute amount needed to reach an effect).

=====Inhalants=====
*[[/N2O|Nitrous Oxide]]

=====Amanita Muscaria=====
The following 3 substances are found in the [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Amanita|Amanita muscaria]] species of mushroom. Although they are not all dissociative, the combination of all three of them is considered to be.
*Muscimol, GABA-A agonist
*Ibotenic acid, NDMA agonist
*Muscarine, Deliriant

----
====Deliriants====

Deliriants are very similar to [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Dissociatives|dissociatives]], and are considered to be true hallucinogens because the visuals they produce are hard or impossible to tell apart from reality. Users under their effects will often have full intellectual conversations with people who aren't actually there. They will also find it hard to tell the difference between aspects of reality. Some people may see their own reflection and believe it is another person copying their actions. Users often retain awareness of their physical surroundings, but are consciously impaired. Almost all deliriants are toxic enough that only a small amount differentiates a recreational dose from a deadly dose.

The natural reference for deliriants is described as being similar to sleepwalking in a nightmare.

Deliriants are either Tropane based or Antihistamine based.

=====Tropanes=====
The first three tropanes are naturally occurring in various plants, including Deadly Nightshade, and the more commonly known [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Datura|Datura (Jimson Weed)]]
*Atropine #
*Scopolamine # 
*Hyoscyamine # 

The final tropane is the only Deliriant that is considered non-toxic
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/QNB|3-Quinuclidinyl Benzilate]]

=====Antihistaminics=====
Antihistaminics can produce delirious effects at several times the clinical dosage. The side effects are considered unpleasant by many, and considerable overdosage can lead to coma or death.
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Dramamine|Diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl)
*[[Drugs:Fact and Fiction/Dramamine|Dimenhydrinate]] (Dramamine, Gravol)
*Cyclizine (Marezine or Marzine)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Stimulants===
Stimulants create a fast rush of euphoria and energy, usually by speeding up cognitive processing and the central nervous system. Breathing and heart rate increase, thoughts race, minds speak. Although generally lacking in visual effects, many stimulants cause a general feeling of well being, and the increased thought processing allows for greater enjoyment of your surroundings, including music. Because of the increase in breathing an heart rate, most stimulants become quite dangerous at excessive doses. In moderation and at recreational doses however, most are relatively safe.

Most stimulants work by causing the brain to increase the level of neurotransmitters available for use (i.e. Seretonin and Dopamine). Once their effects wear down however, the user experiences a depressive crash because of the sudden reversal of effects. This often leads to redosing, which can quickly become habitual and very addicting. Stimulant users should have strong will power, and the ability to tell themselves 'no', and stick with it - Less they wish to join the many individuals that have succumbed to addiction.

====Plant Stimulants====
A good number of stimulants are derived from plants. So naturally the plants themselves also have a stimulant effect. Though not generally as strong as any purified stimulant, the plants are very safe to use as a stimulant on a frequent basis and can generally be enjoyed free of major side effects.

*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Coca|Coca]]
*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Kratom|Kratom]]
*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Khat|Khat]]

----

====Methylxanthines====
Methylzanthines are a group of 3 mild stimulants based upon the Xanthine molecule. Best known amongst them is Caffeine, which is the only Xanthine to have recreational value. The remaining two are found naturally in chocolate and tea and have high toxicity if attempted to be used recreationally. All Xanthines are diuretic (that is, they increase frequency of urination).

*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Caffeine|Caffeine]]
*Theophylline
*Theobromine

----

====Sympathomimetic Amines====
Sympathomimetic drugs include the common stimulants that everyone has heard so much about in the media. From Cocaine, to Ecstacy, to Amphetamines, to Crystal Meth. Almost every recreational stimulant is a part of this subclass.

*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Cocaine|Cocaine]]
*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Ephedrine|Ephedrine]]
*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Pseudoephedrine|Pseudoephedrine]]
*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Methcathinone|Methcathinone]]

=====Amphetamines=====
Amphetamines are not a true class of drug, but rather a way of a grouping several drugs with similar effects together. Amphetamines work primarily by releasing stored dopamine, norepinephrine and seretonin in the brain, as well as blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. This combines a feeling of pleasure (Seretonin) with a speedy rush of energy (Norepinephrine is very similar to adrenaline).

*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Amphetamine|Amphetamine]]
*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Meth|Methamphetamine]]
*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Adderal|Adderall]]
*[[{{FULLBOOKNAME}}/Ritalin|Methylphenidate (Ritalin)]]

=====Stimulant Empathogens=====
See [[#Empathogens|Psychedelic Empathogens]] - These are the same drugs.

====Cholinergics====

{{mbox templates}}
This is the {{tl|imbox}} or '''image message box''' meta-template.

It is used to build message box templates for file (image) pages. It offers several different colors, uses default images if no image parameter is given and it has some other features.

This template works almost exactly like {{tl|ambox}} and uses the same parameters.

=== Usage ===
Simple usage example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{imbox | text = Some text.}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{imbox | text = Some text.}}


Complex example:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{imbox
| type      = style
| image     = [[File:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px|link-]]
| style     = width: 400px; 
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{imbox
| type      = style
| image     = [[File:Emblem-question-yellow.svg|40px|link=]]
| style     = width: 400px; 
| textstyle = color: red; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;
| text      = The message body text.
}}

=== Image message box types ===
The following examples use different '''type''' parameters but use no image parameters thus they use the default images for each type.

{{imbox
| type = speedy
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;speedy&lt;/u&gt; – Speedy deletion templates.
}}
{{imbox
| type = delete
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;delete&lt;/u&gt; – Deletion templates.
}}
{{imbox
| type = content
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;content&lt;/u&gt; – Major warnings and problems.
}}
{{imbox
| type = style
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;style&lt;/u&gt; – Minor warnings and problems.
}}
{{imbox
| type = notice
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;notice&lt;/u&gt; – Notices and messages of any kind, both permanent and temporary.
}}
{{imbox
| type = move
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;move&lt;/u&gt; – Move and rename messages and proposals.
}}
{{imbox
| type = protection
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;protection&lt;/u&gt; – Protection templates.
}}
{{imbox
| type = license
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;license&lt;/u&gt; – License template.
}}
{{imbox
| type = featured
| text = type=&lt;u&gt;featured&lt;/u&gt; – Featured image templates.
}}

=== Other images ===
The default images shown above are mostly for convenience. In many cases it is more appropriate to use more specific images. These examples use the '''image''' parameter to specify an image other than the default images.

{{imbox
| type  = style
| image = [[Image:Gnome-dev-camera.svg|42px]]
| text  = type = style &lt;br /&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Gnome-dev-camera.svg|42px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This image is used for {{tl|cleanup-image}}. 
}}
{{imbox
| type  = move
| image = [[Image:To Commons.svg|52px]]
| text  = type = move &lt;br /&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:To Commons.svg|52px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This image is used for {{tl|copy to Wikimedia Commons}}. 
}}
{{imbox
| type  = license
| image = [[Image:Heckert GNU white.svg|48px]]
| text  = type = license &lt;br /&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Heckert GNU white.svg|48px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This image is used for the GFDL license templates such as {{tl|GFDL}}.
}}

=== Special ===
Some other parameter combinations.

{{imbox
| text  = No type and no image given ('''default''')
}}
{{imbox
| image = none
| text  = No type and '''image=none''' – No image is used and the '''text''' uses the whole message box area.
}}

{{imbox
| type = license
| image = [[Image:Imbox license.svg|40px]] &lt;br /&gt; [[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Shuttle.svg|30px]]
| text  = type = license &lt;br /&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Imbox license.svg|40px]] &amp;lt;br&gt; [[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br /&gt; imageright = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Shuttle.svg|30px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

{{imbox
| type = license
| image = [[Image:Imbox license.svg|40px]] &lt;br /&gt; [[Image:Ambox warning yellow.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Shuttle.svg|30px]]
| text  = '''This file is in the [[w:public domain|public domain]] because it was created by [[w:NASA|NASA]].'''
&lt;br&gt;Note that use of NASA logos, insignia and emblems are restricted per US law.
}}

{{imbox
| type       = license
| image      = [[Image:Imbox license.svg|40px]]
| text       = 
type = license &lt;br /&gt; image = &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Imbox license.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br /&gt; below = &lt;nowiki&gt;{{imbox | type = content | text = '''This license tag is deprecated!''' }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| below = 
  {{imbox
  | type = content
  | text = '''This license tag is deprecated!'''
  }}
}}

=== Parameters ====
List of all parameters:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{imbox
| type  = speedy / delete / content / style / notice / 
          move / protection / license / featured
| image = none / [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| imageright = [[Image:Some image.svg|40px]]
| style = CSS value
| textstyle = CSS value
| text  = The message body text.
| below = More text or another imbox.
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''type'''
:If no '''type''' parameter is given the template defaults to type '''notice'''. That means it gets a blue border.

'''image'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''image''' parameter is given the template uses a default image. Which default image it uses depends on the '''type''' parameter. 
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;image = [[Image:Gnome-dev-camera.svg|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''none''' = Means that no image is used.

'''imageright'''
:'''No parameter''' = If no '''imageright''' parameter is given then no image is shown on the right side.
:'''An image''' = Should be an image with usual wiki notation. 40px - 50px width are usually about right depending on the image height to width ratio. (But the message box can handle images of any size.) For example: 
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;imageright = [[Image:Nuvola apps bookcase.png|40px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:'''Anything''' = Any other object that you want to show on the right side.

'''style'''
:An optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] value used by the entire message box table. Without quotation marks &lt;code&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt;. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;style = margin-bottom: 0.5em;&lt;/code&gt;

'''textstyle'''
:An optional [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] value used by the text cell. For example:
::&lt;code&gt;textstyle = text-align: center;&lt;/code&gt;

'''text'''
:The message body text.

'''below'''
:A full width area below the images and text area. Can take a text or any kind of object, for instance another imbox:
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;below = {{imbox | type = content | text = This license tag is deprecated. }} &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

=== Technical details ===
Namespace &quot;Image:&quot; was renamed to &quot;File:&quot; on 11 December 2008. This template was created long before that, and that is why it is named &quot;imbox&quot; as in &quot;image message box&quot;.

If you need to use special characters in the text parameter then you need to escape them like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
{{imbox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

{{imbox
| text  = &lt;div&gt;
Equal sign = and a start and end brace { } work fine as they are. 
But here is a pipe {{!}} and two end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
And now a pipe and end braces &lt;nowiki&gt;|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
}}

This template uses the imbox CSS classes in [[MediaWiki:Common.css/Mboxes.css]] for most of its looks, thus it is fully skinnable.

Internally this meta-template uses HTML markup instead of wiki markup for the table code. That is the usual way we make meta-templates since wiki markup has several drawbacks. For instance it makes it harder to use [[m:Help:ParserFunctions|parser functions]] and special characters in parameters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GtkRadiant/NAV
|previous=Brush Manipulating
|current=Basic Transformation
|next=The CSG Tools
}}
There are four basic tools used to transform brushes, of which only two are frequently used, these are the ''Default'' or ''QE'' activated by clicking [[Image:QEButtonRadiant.png|22px]], the ''rotate'' tool activated by clicking [[Image:RotateButtonRadiant.png|22px]] or by pressing '''R''', the ''scale'' tool activated by clicking [[Image:ScaleButtonRadiant.png|22px]] and the ''transform'' (move) tool activated by clicking [[Image:TransButtonRadiant.png|22px]] or pressing '''W'''.

===The QE Tool===
The ''QE tool'' (lets call it that) is the tool you will use the most when transforming brushes, it can move, create and scale brushes (not in the same way as the scale tool though). To move a brush with the ''QE tool'', simply click ''within'' the brush (after selecting it) and drag the mouse.

Creating brushes is also as simple as dragging the mouse over the grid (while holding down the left mouse button). The newly created brush will then appear where the last selection was. Now if this is hard to understand, the brush can only be created in two dimensions, which are different depending on what view you are in, the ''third'' dimension is then taken from the previous selection. If you still don't get it, try it out.

The final function of the ''QE tool'' is to scale brushes, if you have ever used a 3D modelling software such as 3Ds Max or Blender, you will realize this is similar to the ''Extrude'' tool of those applications.
You can scale a brush by clicking ''outside'' the brush to scale (after selecting it) and dragging the mouse while holding down the left mouse button. This will then ''extrude'' the brush where you drag. You ''will'' use this a lot.
[[Image:RotateLinesRadiant.png|right|frame|The ''rotate lines'' how they appear in the 3D view.]]
===The Rotate tool===
The ''rotate tool'', also called ''free rotate'' is used to (guess what) rotate brushes freely. However this usually distorts the texture so it's not really recommended to be used on stuff where the texture alignment matters. However it's good to rotate things like rocks where it doesn't matter.
For things where it matters, use the rotate and flip tools [[Image:TransformButtonsRadiant.png|130px|border]] instead. They will make sure the textures stay aligned.

To use the ''rotate tool'', drag the lines to rotate along one axis only and drag between the lines to rotate the selected brush freely.

''Note: This tool is very useful for rotating models since the textures don't get disorted there''

===The Scale tool===
The ''scale tool'' is used to (getting used to it by now eh) scale brushes. However, like the rotate tool, this tool will also mess up the texture alignment. Usually, it's better to use the ''QE tool'' to scale brushes.

To use the ''scale tool'', drag the colored lines to scale along one axis and he yellow box to scale along all axis.

''Note: This tool is very useful for scaling models since the textures don't get disorted there''

===The Transform tool===
''The transform tool'' should be called move tool, since that is what it does, it moves stuff, entities, brushes, models. When the tool is activated, three big arrows, one for each axis will appear in the 3D view, and 2 big arrows will appear in the grid (2D) view.

Dragging these arrows will move the object back and forth along the respective axis, dragging the cyan box in the middle will allow you to move the selected object in any direction.

&lt;!-- If anyone bothers to use this [[Image:DragArrowsRadiant.png|right|frame|The two transformation arrows how they appear in the grid view.]] go for it --&gt;</text>

== A Puzzle ==

A sudoku puzzle can be expressed in matrix form.  Here is part of one from a Times book of sudokus.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;sudoku name=&quot;Times 1 p1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;matrix&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col&gt;6&lt;/col&gt;
            &lt;col&gt;1&lt;/col&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col&gt;3&lt;/col&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col&gt;2&lt;/col&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col&gt;5&lt;/col&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col&gt;8&lt;/col&gt;
            &lt;col&gt;1&lt;/col&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;
            &lt;col&gt;7&lt;/col&gt;
        &lt;/row&gt;
        &lt;row&gt;
            &lt;col/&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== The Main script ==

The main script is passed a URL referencing the problem XML file.  The matrix format is converted to a sequence of cells, the puzzle solved, the resultant cell list converted back to a matrix and the matrix printed. The elapsed time of the solution search is computed and displayed after the initial problem and the solution.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
import module namespace su = 'http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/wiki/sudoku' at 'sudoku4.xqm';

declare option exist:serialize 'method=xhtml  media-type=text/html';

declare function local:duration-as-ms($t) {
      round((minutes-from-duration($t) * 60 + seconds-from-duration($t)) * 1000 )
};

let $url := request:get-parameter('url',())
let $sudoku :=doc($url)/sudoku
let $p := $sudoku/matrix
let $pc :=  su:matrix-to-cells($p)
let $start := util:system-time()
let $ps := su:solve($pc)  
let $finish := util:system-time()
let $elapsedms := local:duration-as-ms($finish - $start)
let $s := su:cells-to-matrix($ps)

return 
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Solving Sudoku problem {string($sudoku/@name)}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;table border = '1'&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{su:matrix-to-table($p)}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{su:matrix-to-table($s)}&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;/table&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Elapsed time in milliseconds : {$elapsedms}&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Functions ==

This module defines the necessary functions to support a brute force, depth-first search of the solution tree. Two representations of a sudoku puzzle are used here:
 nested columns within rows  -  element(matrix) - the input format
 list of cells with explicit row and column numbers  - element(cells)

The algorithm starts with the cell list representation. The number of possible solutions to every empty square is calculated.  If there there is a cell with only one value, that cell is added to the list of cells and the algorithm continues.  If there is more than one possible value for a cell, the algorithm iterates over the possible values, positing that each in turn is the correct value. If there is no possible value, that partial solution is infeasible and that solution path is abandoned, returning null and the next possible cell value will be tried.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;

Time

I'm not so sure this is as short as the author said. Gotta take chop times into account. The cook time is 15 minutes, I'd put the prep at at least 5, if you're a whiz with a knife.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'd recommend an edit. The bit about the brown stuff at the bottom of the pan? That's called fond, and the act of adding the broth later to break up the fond is called deglazing.

Cook books should educate, and a bit of simple terminology would probably help this article. Good recipe, though.</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

[[Image:QW3Web Settings Properties.jpg|center]]

===Send Results via Website to Email===

If you tick this box you will be able to enter an email address in the text box.  Make sure that you input the correct address of the email account where you would like the results to be sent. By default, all results sent to that email address will be automatically received and stored by the Question Writer Tracker server. To change the settings so that the results are only emailed and not stored by the Tracker server you must register with Question Writer Tracker and change the account preferences associated with that email address.

Please note that if you publish your quiz on the Question Writer Tracker service, this setting will be ignored, and all results will be sent to the e-mail address associated with your Question Writer Tracker account.

===Send Results Before Showing Any Feedback===

If you tick the '''Send Results Before Showing Any Feedback''' box, the results will be sent to the server before any feedback is displayed to the quiz-taker. This prevents the quiz-taker from shutting down the quiz after he sees what his score is, but before his results have been transmitted.

===Use a Custom Results Server===

If you're using your own script to process results, you can enter the address of your own server and results will be sent here. By default, Question Writer's server address will appear in this box.

===Use a Customs Results Backup Server===

You can also define the backup server, which is used if the main server can't be reached. If you're not using a backup server, just make this the same as the main server, and the quiz will continue to try to reach the main server until it is reachable. By default, Question Writer's server address will appear in this box.
 
===What must the server reply?===

If your custom server successfully saved the results, it must imperatively reply &quot;&lt;OK/&gt;&quot;. If you do not reply anything, QW will consider that there is a problem and try again and again.

[[Image:QW3Web Settings Properties.jpg|center]]

If you wish you can direct the quiz taker to a new web page when they complete the quiz.  You do this by ticking the box in the '''After Quiz''' section and entering the relevant web address.  Please note, the automatic forwarding will only work when the quiz is published - not during the preview.

If the quiz opened as a pop up window, you may want the quiz window to close when it is complete. This is useful for situations where the quiz taker needs to go back to their previous window that may not be web based. Enter this URL http://www.questionwriter.com/common/close.html to attempt to close the quiz window.

===Browser Options===
If you tick the '''Maximise Quiz in Browser''' tick box this will ensure that the quiz expands to fill as much of the browser window as possible. Sometimes this stretching will distort the quality of a bitmap (jpeg/gif) style background and you may prefer to have the quiz always shown at its default resolution.

===User Responses Recovery===

The power can get cut, hardware can fail, the browser can crash, the test taker can close the browser by mistake, the internet connection can go down, the whole internet can go down, the results server and backup server can fail.

By ticking this box you can ensure that if something goes wrong while a user is taking a test, they can just bring the test up again, and all their answers will still be there. The timer will be set at the correct value too.

The responses are saved locally in the browser every 10 seconds, and the responses are deleted when the user sucessfully exits the test. The only time you might not want to use this feature is if you're collecting sensitive information, and you don't want to have this information stored on the user's computer.

The feature also works in combination with randomization, so it'll bring up the correct pre-randomized version of the test when the user re-enters the quiz.{{clr}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Randomization==
Randomization is useful if you are expecting quiz takers to re-sit the quiz repeatedly.  You can create a quiz with a large pool or bank of questions and set Question Writer to randomly select a specific number of questions from this bank.  The more questions in your question bank the better as it reduces the chances that they will see the same questions time after time.


[[Image:QW3 Quiz Details random.jpg|center]]


If you tick the box to use randomization, the quiz will automatically select a random set of questions from the total question bank in the root level of your quiz.  You also specify how many questions you want to ask.  This will be reflected in the number of questions you add to your question bank. For example you might set the value to 10. 10 questions will then be selected from the question bank for this quiz and asked in a random order. If you have 10 or fewer questions in the question bank, then all of the questions will be asked, but still in a random order.

Randomization works by generating a specified number of randomized quizzes when you publish the quiz - then one of these 'pre-randomized' quizzes is selected for the user to take when they access the quiz. You set or change the number of pre-randomized quizzes to be loaded as part of the 
[[Question_Writer_3_Manual/Quiz_Options/Quiz Details/Pre-Randomized|Quiz Details]] set up.  Remember to upload all of the files generated when you publish the quiz online.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; | 
With the '''Professional Version''' you can randomly choose which sections are used too. Quiz randomization randomizes what's directly inside the quiz and doesn't change what is inside sections or subsections. (Either a whole section will be asked or not asked and count as one selection.)

Section properties also allows you to further randomize what appears inside sections.

===Randomization Seed===
If you want to create a randomized quiz and have an identical paper copy you will need to use this feature which provides &quot;consistent randomization&quot;.  When you tick the box the quiz will be randomized in the same way each time. To change the randomization, just choose a different the seed number - each seed number creates a different, but predictable randomization.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Moderating Online Discussions for Learning''' ==


Moderation is yet one more process that has been remediated from the classic form – that of presiding over a meeting – to the more modern example of e-moderators – one who presides over an electronic, online conference or meeting.  Computer-mediated conferencing in this format requires a much broader range of expertise; from computer skills to inter- and intra-personal communication (Salmon, 2000).  Moderating an online discussion for learning is a very complicated task.  More so than in face to face courses, the ‘teacher’, ‘moderator’, or ‘facilitator’ must work to see that instructional objectives are met, while providing a friendly environment in which to work. It becomes the moderators goal to not only evaluate content for clarity and subject matter, but he or she must also be aware of the need for learners to build concepts by working together.  Such cooperative learning can flourish in online environments only if they are treated as separate from their face to face predecessors.   In fact, it has been suggested that when these conferences fail, it is because of an inability of a e-moderator to carry-over the skills of face-to-face leadership to the online setting during the initial stages (Collins &amp; Berge, 1997).

Salmon (2000) notes that most e-moderators are most often active in the first 1-3 weeks of the conference.  At this point the activities need to be very structured in order to allow students to explore different aspects of the program and conference, as well as to develop a comfort level with the material.  During this time the e-moderator often works as a group facilitator, conference developer and content provider.  It is also important to provide the rules for the conference and to start to develop the shared understandings and trust that will allow the conference to flourish (Salmon, 2000).

As the conference develops, Salmon (2000) refers to the experience of a case study of the Open University Business School in Wales, in which the e-moderator withdrew from active participation.  This allowed for the students to develop a commitment to each other and to the activities themselves.  Thus the conference became more reflective and the role of ‘expert’ was no longer required.

In online learning environments the terms ‘separate’ and ‘connected’ ways of knowing are becoming more popular (Love &amp; Guthrie, 1999).  Rather than used to assess student work, these themes are used to help users understand the level to which they are communicating effectively in an online forum.  Each post can be evaluated based on its demonstration of either separate or connected ways of knowing, however, it is possible to demonstrate a combination of the two types.  ‘Separate Knowing’ is represented in posts that are objective, use logic to defend theories, and are critical of new ideas unless they are well supported with facts or come from someone whose authority in the area is respected.  ‘Connected Knowing’ is represented in posts that are more empathetic, try to understand the shared experience that has led to the knowledge, and will offer to help others if possible (Clinchy, 1996).
 
Some studies have demonstrated that males often demonstrate more separate ways of knowing versus females who generally demonstrate more connected ways of knowing.  Yet for a truly collaborative group to succeed, both ways of knowing must be represented (Clinchy, 1996).   Clinchy (1996) also notes that a single post often displays both of these characteristics.

This brings to light another important point of moderating online discussions: though we often assume everyone understands how to function appropriately in online situations we often forget that many users have had no training in the specific skills necessary to survive in an online environment.  Chau (n.d.) comments that, “Students have to learn to respect perspectives that are very different from their own. Without non-verbal cues such tone, gesture, and facial expression, it is more likely for someone to misinterpret a comment which sometime results in flaming (i.e. heated, hostile exchange of comments).”  Feenberg &amp; Xin (n.d.) add to this,
 
''This situation poses a special problem for teaching since student motivation to participate must be maintained through recognition of contributions to the discussion despite the lack of the tacit signs of attention and appreciation that play such an important role in the face-to-face classroom. We will discuss this problem in more detail in the section on moderating which follows this one.''

It is very possible, especially with younger students, that a contributor will take a comment out of the context in which it was written.  Here the e-moderator must select the best way to stop the escalating behaviour, whether using email, a phone call, or, if possible, a face to face meeting to help to remedy the situation (Chau, n.d.).  In respect to these difficulties, the instructor/e-moderator must play a coaching role as well.  His or her job changes from delivering the curriculum to facilitating an environment in which students gain the key learning experiences necessary from the online activities developed.  Coaching must focus on how to keep discussions on topic and when and where to add comments to promote connected ways of knowing (Chau, n.d.).

The e-moderator must also ensure that the community with which they work are ‘absorbed’ into the online discussion.  Absorption is a term that comes from the work of Erving Goffman who also referred to the term, ‘engrossment’ as a description of the sociological factors that compel us to participate in social encounters like sports and games.  “The concept of absorption refers to the sharing of purpose among people who do not necessarily form a community but have accepted a common work or play as the context for an intense, temporary relationship. The term nicely describes participants' feelings about an exciting online discussion. They are 'absorbed' in the activity as one might be in a game of poker or tennis.” (Freenberg &amp; Xin, n.d.)  The moderator needs to work within these structures by welcoming new users and maintaining lines of communication with those returning.  The more a user feels encouraged by the environment in which the discussion takes place, the more absorbed he or she will become.  Chau (n.d.) suggests that moderators should go a step further by bringing so called ‘lurkers’ – those that read, but rarely, if ever, contribute to the discussion – into the fold by sending them private messages encouraging participation.   

Lastly it is important to understand the role of the moderator in a learning environment.  It has been made clear that this is a very different role from that of the face to face facilitator, but what exactly are the duties of an e-moderator?  Chau (n.d.) suggests that the majority of tasks revolve around the discussion it self, not surprisingly.  Firstly it is important that the questions themselves be carefully created in order to promote discussion.  Bloom’s Taxonomy is a categorization of questions divided based on the learning that can be generated by a given question.  Single-word answer questions, so called, ‘copy and paste’ questions, and those requiring little thought take the lowest level.  Evaluation questions, or those which call for the answerer to choose between a set of options and describe why he or she has made that choice, are found at the highest level (Bloom, 1984).  E-moderators should incorporate questions from all levels of the taxonomy in any online discussion.  Furthermore, an e-moderator must create clear guidelines that help users understand exactly what is and is not allowed in the discussion forum.  Lastly, an e-moderator will be called on during the course to reword questions if the discussion gets ‘off track’ and to provide feedback, summarize the discussion to date and recap previous discussion to reinforce the learning objectives (Chau, n.d.).

Moderators of online discussions for learning have a much more difficult task than they often realize.  It is through their hard work that students are able to develop not only a course subject matter understanding, but the skills required to appropriately socialize online.  In a society which is moving more and more toward electronic communication, it is necessary for students and moderators alike to become well grounded in the theory of disembodied communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Question Properties==

This window contains a series of tick boxes relating to the appearance of the question on the screen, most of which are self explanatory.

[[Image:QW3advset general.png|center]]

===Show Question Number===

The question number can be displayed at the top of each question page using this option

===Randomize Question Options===

This randomizes the order in which answer options are displayed in Multiple Choice, Multiple Response and Partial Credit question types. In Sequencing and Matching question types, options are always randomized.

===Display Point Values For Questions===

The number of points awarded for each questions is shown to bottom right hand side of the question if this option is selected.

===Display Title With Each Question===

This option displays the title of the quiz at the top of each question page.

===Use Image Zooming===

When an image or piece of Flash is displayed with a question, it can optionally be shown in the top left hand corner and zoomed to full size when the mouse moves over it. If this option is not selected, the image appears at its default size at the top of the question.

===Fill In The Blank Answers Must Use Correct Capitalization===

This determines whether the scoring for Fill In The Blank style questions is case sensitive. If the required answer was 'Blue' but the user entered 'blue' - they would not score any points if this option is selected.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |
By ticking this box you can give quiz takers credit for an answer that is not 100% correct in the sequencing and matching question types.  For matching questions a score based on the number of correct matches is awarded. For sequencing questions, a more complex scoring method is used by calculating the number of correct relative pairs sequenced. (There's an article here that goes into more detail, [http://www.questionwriterblog.com/archives/2008/02/sequencing_question.html]). {{clr}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Text Settings==

This section allows you to use HTML or a variety of embedded fonts (selected from a drop down box) and to select a different font  or font size for your title or body text to replace the default fonts set up within the theme used.

[[Image:QW3 Text settings.jpg|center]]


===Use HTML To Format Text===

When this option is switched on, you can change the way text is displayed by using HTML formatting. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags bold. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags italic. 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;Arial&quot; size=&quot;24&quot; color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Arial Red at point size 24&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the text inside the tags point size 24, color red, font face Arial. Relative sizes can be used - eg -2,-1,+1,+2 to make the text relatively larger or smaller. Absolute sizes can be used also - eg 36. Absolute sizes smaller than 8 are treated as HTML sizes (1 is very small, 7 is very large). Font colors can be HTML colors(red, yellow, white etc) or RGB style colors (color=&quot;#FFCCFF&quot;) 


[[Image:QW3 Using html1.jpg|left]]

[[Image:QW3 Using html2.jpg|right]]

{{clear}}
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Center Alignment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This causes a new paragraph to be created and any text in that paragraph to be aligned in the center. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This creates a new line.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;superscript&lt;/sup&gt;
E = MC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the enclosed text appear as a superscript.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;subscript&lt;/sub&gt;
The chemical symbol for Oxygen is 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
This will make the enclosed text appear as a subscript

HTML formatting can be used in all text fields with one exception - it cannot be applied to the text that appears on next and back buttons.

===Embed Font===

When the quiz taker enters text at the keyboard, the quiz can either use a system font or (with this option checked) an embedded font. Using an embedded font guarantees that the font will be used and the chosen characters will be available. You can ensure that all the letters and accents that a user might want to enter are embedded by choosing the right character set for the quiz taker's language.

The embedded font is used in the Fill in the Blank and Essay style questions. It is also used when the user is prompted for Name/UserID at the start of the quiz.

For text entry in Japanese and other languages with large character sets, it is usually better to switch off this option as the number of characters is very large and leads to a very large file size.

===Override Title Text Font===
Each theme can define a different font to use in the quiz for titles - you can override that selection by choosing your own font here.

===Override Title Text Font Size===
As well as changing the font used you can also change the default font size for the titles.  This could be useful eg if you want to display your quiz using an OHP and need to make sure everyone in the room can read the text.

===Override Body Text Font===
Each theme can define a different font to use in the quiz for body text - you can override that selection by choosing your own font here.

The body text font is also used for text entry, next and back button text, and generally any text that isn't Title text.

===Override Body Text Font Size===
You can override the default font size used in the body text.  This might be useful eg if you have particularly long questions and have trouble fitting them on to a single page.

I don't know if anyone has received this issue but in the step of changing the Map Input axises to all Z. I found that when I rendered the image it just looked like the gradient of white to black. I had to set all the axises to Y to achieve the heightmap. Anyone know what might be happening? I tried doing it twice and got the same result.
: Not sure.  In the version I'm using (2.44), Z is the up axis.  Perhaps in newer versions you can change which axis is up.  I know that was some feedback to the Blender Foundation not too long ago, and they may have taken it to heart. [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] ([[User talk:Moohasha|talk]]) 20:31, 15 December 2008 (UTC)

== Shortcut? ==

Can't you just skip the '''entire''' adjusting the camera section and just take a screen shot from the shaded above view, and crop out the extra with whatever program you like? I would show my results, but this is my first time editing on this site, and I cant figure out how to add pictures...
Oh wait! I just noticed the plus of having the export as the exact size you need, so you don't have to resize, is that the only benefit?
: Yeah, that's the main benefit.  Graphics engines really like textures to be in powers of 2, so by setting up the camera and capturing the rendered image, you can save it as a 512x512, or 1024x1024, or whatever else real easily.  And sorry for the delay.  I haven't checked this article in a long time! =P [[User:Moohasha|Moohasha]] ([[User talk:Moohasha|talk]]) 20:29, 15 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

If you have the '''Professional Version''' of Question Writer you can add your own background image or piece of Flash in place of the one from the theme. See also [[../../../Look and Feel/Change Background and Loader|Background Image]].{{clr}}

| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | [[Image:QW3 Pro star icon.png]]

Use this option to adjust the quality of any jpg images used.  Set the size/image quality balance to suit your own quizzes.  If your quiz is designed for use on a CDROM - usually you'll want to have high quality images and a large file size.  If the quiz is to be available over the internet you'll often want a lower quality image and a smaller file size to minimize quiz download times.{{clr}}

===Flash Version===
You can choose which version of Flash your images will be saved and published as - by selecting from the drop down box.  The higher the version number that you select, the better the image quality will be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Number of Pre-Randomized Quizzes==

If you're using any randomization in your quiz or sections, Question Writer handles this by generating a number of pre-randomized quizzes when you publish. One of these is selected at random each time a quiz-taker accesses the quiz. It is usually better to have more rather than less of these pre-randomized quizzes as this minimizes the possibility that two quiz-takers will see the same quiz or the same quiz-taker will see the same quiz twice in a row.

Balance this against the time it takes to publish your pre-randomized quizzes and the space that the pre-randomized quizzes will take up.



[[Image:QW3Pre Randomized.jpg|center]]


See [[../../../Frequently Asked Questions/Randomization|Frequently Asked Questions]] for an idea of how this can be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Report Options==
A series of tick boxes allow you customize the appearance of the results screen, with the option to add your own message for quiz takers who have passed or failed.  You can also choose not to show the results at all.  The results screen will be shown at the end of the quiz along with any feedback that you have chosen when setting up the '''[[../../Quiz Details/Feedback Method|Feedback Method]]''' in Quiz Details.

You can select from the 3 choices in the drop down box:

*After Each Question
*End of Quiz
*No Question Feedback

If you select '''After Each Question''', the quiz taker will see if they answered correctly as soon as they click on the next question button.

If you select '''End of Quiz''', the quiz taker will be shown their performance on each question as a review at the end of the quiz.

If you select '''No Question Feedback''', the quiz taker will not receive feedback on individual questions.

===Allow User To E-mail Report to===

You can give the quiz taker the option to press a button on the final report screen to email their report. This will use the user's e-mail client and the user will have the opportunity to change the e-mail address / report details.

[[Image:QW3 email results.jpg|center]]


This is a convenience for the user - the results by e-mail service offered in the [[../../Web_Settings/Send_Results_over_the_Internet|Web Settings]] is much more reliable for most purposes.

===Allow User To Print Report===
You can give the quiz taker the option to press a button on the report screen to print their report. This can be a good way to provide a certificate for the quiz-taker.

| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; | '''''Why am I not receiving E-mail results?'''''{{clr}}
|}

There can be a number of reasons why you might not be receiving the results by e-mail.

===1. Quiz Set Up===
Check you have ticked the box in [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings/Send Results over the Internet|Send Results over the Internet]] and given a correct email address for the results to be sent to.

Important Note: If you are publishing your quiz to the Question Writer Tracker service, this setting will be ignored and the e-mail address associated with your Question Writer Tracker account will be used instead.
  
You should make sure that the url for the results server and back up results server are correct.  If you are not using your own custom server, the address for the server should be - http://www.questionwritertracker.com/collator/results.php?email=&lt;br&gt;
and for the back up server - http://www.xquestion.com/results/resultsqw3.php?email=&lt;br&gt;

Note: Don't add your e-mail address to the end of these links. That will be done automatically.
[[image:QW3Web Settings Properties.jpg|center]]


You should then choose the '''[[../../Save and Publish/Publish your Quiz/Publish to the Web|Publish to the Web]]''' option in Publish menu and upload all (at least 3) files to your website. See [[../../Save and Publish/Create a Web Page|Create a Web Page]] for more information on uploading files to your web page.

===2.  Quiz Taker Set Up===
The quiz taker needs to have internet access to send the results through to our server. Check they can access these websites to ensure they have access to the main server and backup server.&lt;br&gt;
http://www.questionwritertracker.com &lt;br&gt;
http://www.xquestion.com

The quiz taker should access the quiz through the webpage (index.html) for results to be sent by e-mail.  See [[Question Writer 3 Manual/Save and Publish/Create a Web Page|Create a Web Page]] for an idea of how you can do this.

===3. E-mail Box Set Up===
We send a lot of e-mails with results and some mail programs get confused and think these e-mails are spam. Check your spam box and any e-mail filter rules to ensure that the results are not being sent to spam. In some instances, your e-mail service provider may not forward the e-mails to you if it identifies them as spam. If this happens we recommend you alert your e-mail service provider, but often the fastest way to correct this is to set up another e-mail box to receive the e-mail. Many people have had good success with Gmail. http://www.gmail.com

===4. Set up your results server account===
You might find it easier to view your results online with the results server [http://www.quiz-software.com/qwresults/].  You can register to view your results online. You may also subscribe/unsubscribe from the results by email service here. 

There is more information about the results service in the chapter on [[../../Save and Publish/Results|Results]].

You can enter most symbols and equations using the HTML formatting feature. The formatting allows subscripts and superscripts which are particularly useful for mathematical and chemistry formulae. See '''[[../../Quiz Options/Appearance Settings/Text Settings|Text Settings]]''' to learn how to include HTML formatted text.

If you need to enter symbols which are not included in the current HTML set, you can write your equation using some other software eg in MSWord and then take a snapshot.  You can then load this image to the question.  For more information on adding images see [[../../About Questions/Adding Questions|Adding Questions]].

Yes!  This is a feature of the online interface. You can access it here
http://www.questionwritertracker.com
You'll need to register and log-on to view the results.  You'll see a small Excel icon beside the quizzes - click on this to download the results as an Excel file.

You can have more questions in your quiz than are asked at each attempt. Use the [[../../Quiz Options/Quiz Details/Randomization|randomization]] to select a number of questions from a larger bank of questions in the quiz on each attempt.

If you're asking 10 questions on each try - set the quiz up to ask 10 questions randomly selected from the 100 or 1,000.  Or have sections containing 10 questions each, and randomly select one from each section.

The default for generating pre-randomized quizzes is set at 5 - you can increase this to, eg, 50-100 to ensure a good random spread for 10 from 1000.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{navigation|Book=Algebra
|current=Arithmetic
|previous=Who should read this book
|next=Order of Operations
|cat=Algebra (book)}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Arithmetic is the process of performing certain operations on constant numbers or variables. There are seven arithmetic operations covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, roots, and logarithm.

==Addition==
{{wikipedia|Addition}}

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ 1 + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

To define the number one is a rather difficult task, but we all have a good intuitive sense of what &quot;oneness&quot; is.  Oneness is the property of having or thinking of a singular quantity. For example, think of when you have one dollar, one bushel of potatoes, or one light year.  From here we can recursively (that is, relating to the last one) define the natural numbers by assigning a new name for each new number of ones that we have:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| 1 || 1 || one
|-
| 2 || 1 + 1 || two
|-
| 3 || 1 + 1 + 1 || three
|-
| &amp;#8942; || &amp;#8942; || &amp;#8942;
|-
| n || 1 + 1 + … + 1 || n ones
|}

Now that we have named the numbers we can define addition as the process of counting how many ones we have. For example,
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ 5 + 3 = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + (1 + 1 +1)  = 8&lt;/math&gt;

[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Addition Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Addition Problems&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;

==Subtraction==
{{wikipedia|Subtraction}}

Subtraction can likewise be defined as counting initial quantity of ones and removing some amount of them. For example:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ 5 - 3 = (1+1+1+1+1) - (1+1+1) = 2 &lt;/math&gt;
means 5 ones remove 3 ones, leaving a result of 2 ones.

[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Subtraction Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Subtraction Problems&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;

==Multiplication==
{{wikipedia|Multiplication}}

Multiplication is a shorthand (that is, a faster way of writing something) for repeated addition. For example:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ 5\cdot3 = 15 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
What this means is to add up '3' 5 times; or add up '5' 3 times.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ 5\cdot3 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15 &lt;/math&gt;

[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Multiplication Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Multiplication Problems&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;
Note that in some regions and cases, it is better to use the cross symbol (&lt;math&gt; \times &lt;/math&gt;) or the letter &quot;x&quot; instead of the dot. Most regions use the dot instead of the cross symbol because the cross symbol looks like the letter &quot;x&quot;.

==Division==
{{wikipedia|Division (mathematics)}}
Division is the opposite of multiplication. 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{6}{3} = 2 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

This example asks if six is 1+1+1+1+1+1, and three is 1+1+1, then how many sets of three can we break six into?  The answer is of course 2, because

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\ 6 = 1+1+1+1+1+1 = (1+1+1)+(1+1+1) = 3 + 3 &lt;/math&gt;; two sets of three.

[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Division Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Division Problems&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;

Division is the first operation where a problem arises.  In all the previously defined operations (addition, subtraction, and multiplication) we could perform the operation on any pair of numbers we chose.  However, with division we cannot divide by zero.  Much will be said about this fact throughout the course of this book, and even through your studies in all of mathematics.

== Exponentiation ==
{{wikipedia|Exponentiation}}
What are exponents?

''Exponents'' are a shorthand used for repeated multiplication of the same number.  Remember that when you were first introduced to multiplication it was as a shorthand for repeated addition.  For example, you learned that: 4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;5.  The expression &quot;4 &amp;times; &quot; told us how many times we needed to add. Exponents are the same type of shorthand for multiplication. Exponents are written in superscript (that is, a smaller number written above) after a regular-sized number. 

For example: 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 2 = 8. The number in larger font is called the base. The number in superscript is called the exponent.  The exponent tells us how many times the base is multiplied by itself. In this example, 2 is called the base and 3 is called the exponent.

The expression 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is read aloud as &quot;2 raised to the third power&quot;, or simply &quot;2 cubed&quot;.

Here are some other examples:

6 &amp;times; 6 = 6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (This would read aloud as &quot;six times six is ''six raised to the second power''&quot; or more simply &quot;six times six is ''six squared''&quot;.) &lt;br&gt;
7 &amp;times; 7 &amp;times; 7 &amp;times; 7 = 7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; (This would read aloud as &quot;seven times seven times seven times seven equals ''seven raised to the fourth power''&quot;.  There are no alternate expression for  ''raised to the fourth power''.  It is only the second and third powers that usually get abbreviated because they come up more often.  When it is clear what is being talked about, people often drop the words &quot;raised&quot; and &quot;power&quot; and might simply say &quot;''seven to the fourth''&quot;.)


In general, an exponent of a number to power of n
:; a &amp;times; a &amp;times; a ... = &lt;math&gt;a^n &lt;/math&gt;  
The base is a and it is multiplied by itself n times.

When we look at exponents again later in this book we will see that changing the type of number used for the exponent begins to have some very sophisticated results.  To get a feel about why some people enjoy math read about [[w:euler's identity#Mathematical beauty | mathematical beauty]] and the equation &lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Exponent Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Exponentiation Problems&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;

== Roots ==
{{Wikipedia|Square root|Cube root|Nth root}}

What are Roots?

''Roots'' are the opposite for exponents.  It's easy, although perhaps long, to compute exponents given a root.  For instance 7*7*7*7 = 49*49 = 2401.  So, we know the fourth root of 2401 is 7, and the square root of 2401 is 49.  What is the third root of 2401?  This [[w:nth_root_algorithm|article]] gives a formula for determining the answer, while this [[w:nth_root|article]] gives a detailed explanation of roots.  

Finding the value for a particular root is difficult.  This is because exponentiation is a different kind of function than addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  When we graph functions we will see that polynomials that use exponentiation use curves instead of lines.  Using algebra we will see that not all of these polynomials are functions, that knowing when a polynomial is a relationship or a function can allow us to make certain types of assumptions, and we can use these assumptions to build mental models for topics that would otherwise be impossible to understand.

For now we will deal with roots by turning them back into exponents.

The positive nth root of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is represented as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[n]{x} = r&lt;/math&gt;.  We get rid of the root by raising our answer to the nth power, &lt;math&gt;r^n = x.\!\,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
[[Algebra/Arithmetic/Root Problems|'''&lt;u&gt;Problems Using Roots&lt;/u&gt;''']]
&lt;/center&gt;

==Logarithm==
{{Wikipedia|Logarithm}}

Logarithm is an operation that is similar to exponentiation and roots.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lead-acid batteries have a very low energy-to-weight ratio, a low energy-to-volume ratio and the ability to supply high surge currents (i.e: the cells maintain a relatively large power-to-weight ratio). Due to these features and their low cost, they are used in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by automobile starter motors.
[[File:UL20712.jpg|thumb|Lead Acid Rechargeable Battery]]


==History==
Lead-acid batteries was invented in 1859 by French physicist '''Gaston Planté'''. These batteries are the oldest type of rechargeable battery.

==Specifications and Design==
* Open-circuit (quiescent) at full charge: 12.6 V to 12.8 V (2.10-2.13V per cell)
* Open-circuit at full discharge: 11.8 V to 12.0 V
* Loaded at full discharge: 10.5 V.
* Continuous-preservation (float) charging: 13.4 V for gelled electrolyte; 13.5 V for AGM (absorbed glass mat) and 13.8 V for flooded cells
&lt;br&gt;
All voltages are at 20 °C (68 °F), and must be adjusted -0.022V/°C for temperature changes. Float voltage recommendations vary, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Precise float voltage (±0.05 V) is critical to longevity; insufficient voltage (causes sulfation, explained later) which is almost as detrimental as excessive voltage (causing corrosion and electrolyte loss). After full charge, terminal voltage drops quickly to 13.2 V and then slowly to 12.6 V.
&lt;br&gt;
* Typical (daily) charging: 14.2 V to 14.5 V (depending on manufacturer's recommendation)
* Equalization charging (for flooded lead acids): 15 V for no more than 2 hours. Battery temperature must be monitored.
* Gassing threshold: 14.4 V

===Equations===
The lead-acid cell (usually part of a battery) also works on the principal of redox reactions. In its case the anode is a sheet of metallic lead immersed in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;. The lead oxidises according to the following equation:

Pb&lt;sub&gt;(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 


The cathode is a sheet of lead dioxide, also immersed in H2SO4(aq), which is reduced:


PbO&lt;sub&gt;2(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4(s)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;(l)&lt;/sub&gt;


Thus the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; is the electrolyte.

==Sulfation==
Lead-acid batteries lose the ability to hold a charge when discharged for too long due to sulfation, the crystallization of lead sulfate. Sulfation occurs in all lead-acid batteries during normal operation. It clogs the grids, impedes recharging and then expands, cracking the plates and destroying the battery. Sulfation can be avoided if the battery is fully recharged when there is no charge in the battery. The process can often be at least partially prevented or reversed by a ''desulfation'' technique called pulse conditioning, in which short but powerful current surges are repeatedly sent through the damaged battery. After some time, this procedure breaks down and dissolves the sulfate crystals, restoring some of the capacity.

==Safety Concerns==
Lead is extremely toxic. Long-term exposure to even tiny amounts of lead can cause brain and kidney damage, hearing impairment and learning problems in children.

==Maintenance==
* Ammonia can neutralize spilled battery acid.
* Surplus ammonia and water evaporate, leaving an ammonium sulfate residue.
* Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is also commonly used for this purpose.

== Solution ==
{{Helpful hint|hint=You may need to review [[General Chemistry/Solubility|solubility]] and [[General Chemistry/Properties of Solutions|the properties of solutions]].}}
All ionic compounds are soluble in water to some extent, but the degree of solubility varies. While some compounds dissolve almost completely, others dissolve to such a small extent that they are simply called ''insoluble'' compounds. Such compounds include calcium sulfate, silver chloride, and lead hydroxide. Generally, ionic compounds whose component ions have larger charge magnitudes are less soluble because the ions are attracted too much to dissociate.  A soluble compound will dissociate because of the attractions with the surrounding water molecules are strong enough to separate the ions.

For an ionic compound to dissociate, the forces of attraction between its component ions and the surrounding water molecules must be greater than the forces of attraction between the ions within the compound. When introduced to an aqueous environment, ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, sodium hydroxide, and ammonium bromide dissolve because of this.

== Solubility Constant ==
{|border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{AB}_{(s)} \xrightarrow{water} \hbox{A}^+_{(aq)} + \hbox{B}^-_{(aq)}&lt;/math&gt;
| This reaction shows an ionic compound AB dissolving into its ions A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and B&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{[\hbox{A}^+] [\hbox{B}^-]}{[\hbox{AB}]}&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the equilibrium constant for the reaction.  Water is excluded because, although involved, it is not a product or reactant.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;K_{sp} = [\hbox{A}^+] [\hbox{B}^-]&lt;/math&gt;
| Because the undissolved AB is a solid, pure substance, it can be excluded from the expression.  The result is the '''solubility constant K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  It measures the degree of solubility of an ionic compound.
|}

If two or more of the same ion are created by the dissociation of one particle of the ionic compound, the molar concentration of this ion is raised to the power of how many such ions there are. For example, when calcium chloride dissociates, two chloride ions are created in the dissociation of one particle, so the concentration of the chloride ion is squared when calculating K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_{sp} = [\hbox{Ca}^{2+}] [\hbox{Cl}^-]^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

{{Info|1=
K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is the equilibrium constant for the dissolution reaction above.
*If K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is much ''greater'' than 1, the substance is '''soluble'''.
*If K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is very ''close'' to 1, the substance is '''slightly soluble''', or soluble only in very low quantities.
*If K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is ''less'' than 1, the substance is '''insoluble'''.}}

An example of a slightly soluble substance is calcium hydroxide.  In very minute quantities, it will dissolve completely, but in large quantities it remains mostly undissolved.

== Calculations with K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; ==

=== Finding K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; ===

It would not be an uncommon situation if you know a substance's ''solubility'' (g/mL), but you need to know its K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; value.  Follow this example:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;K_{sp} = [\hbox{Ca}^{2+}][\hbox{OH}^-]^2&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the solubility constant for calcium hydroxide.  We wish to determine is numerical value, but we only know that its solubility is 0.185 g per 100 mL.
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{0.185~g}{0.100~L} \times \frac{1.00~mol}{74.09~g} = 2.497 \times 10^{-2}~mol/L&lt;/math&gt;
| We need to know its '''molar solubility''', so we convert units and divide by molar mass.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;K_{sp} = (2.497 \times 10^{-2})(4.994 \times 10^{-2})^2 = 6.23 \times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;
| Now, plug in the molar solubility into the K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; expression.  Notice that the hydroxide concentration is doubled because there will be twice as many moles as the undissolved substance.
|}

We have now determined the K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; value for calcium hydroxide.  It will allow us to determine other information about solutions containing these ions, such as percent ionization and the formation of precipitates.

{{TextBox|1=
;Questions for the reader
Lead(II) iodide is slightly soluble in water.  It forms a bright yellow precipitate if too much is dissolved.  You have determined that 0.75 g will dissolve in one liter of cold water.  What is the molar solubility of lead(II) iodide?  What is the K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; value?

After heating the water, the solubility rises to 4.3 g per liter.  What is the new K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; value?}}

A similar process can be used to determine a substance's solubility by working backwards from the solubility constant.

=== Percent Ionization ===

Once an ionic compound's K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; value is known, it is possible to determine the ''percent ionization'', or relative amount of dissociated ions.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;K_{sp} = [Ag^+]^2[SO_4^{2-}] = 1.20 \times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;
| We know the K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; for silver sulfate, which is slightly soluble, and we want to know the percent ionization.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;1.20 \times 10^{-5} = (2x)^2 \times (x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = 0.0144&lt;/math&gt;
| Substitute ''x'' for the concentration of sulfate and ''2x'' for silver.  Solve for x.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;percent~ionized = \frac{0.0144~mol/L}{2.00~mol/L} = 0.72 %&lt;/math&gt;
| We now know the maximum concentration of the ions.  Any remaining silver nitrate will be undissolved because the solubility has been exceeded and the solution is saturated.  To determine percent ionization, we must know how much silver sulfate was dissolved.  For this example, assume 1.00 mole was dissolved into 0.500 L of water.
|}

As you can see, the percent ionization decreases as the amount of solute increases.  This is because the solution is saturated and no more ions will dissociate.

{{TextBox|1=
;Question for the reader
Lithium fluoride has a K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.84 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.  If 1.5 g are dissolved, what will be the percent ionization?
}}


=== Precipitates ===

Obviously, the dissociate reaction occurs in reverse if there are too many ions.  In this case, the solution is saturated, and any excess ions will solidify and form a precipitate.

If two soluble solutions are mixed, but the can form an insoluble compound, a precipitate will form.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;K_{sp} = [\hbox{Ag}^+][\hbox{Cl}^-] = 1.77 \times 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;
| For example, a solution of silver nitrate is mixed with a solution of sodium chloride.  Both are soluble.  Silver chloride, however, is insoluble.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{.001~g~\hbox{AgNO}_3}{170~g/mol} = 5.9 \times 10^{-6}~mol~\hbox{Ag}^+&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{.001~g~\hbox{NaCl}}{58~g/mol} = 1.7 \times 10^{-5}~mol~\hbox{Cl}^-&lt;/math&gt;
| If 1.00 mg NaCl and 1.00 mg AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are dissolved into 1.00 L of water, will a precipitate form?
|-
| &lt;math&gt;Q = (5.9 \times 10^{-6})(1.7 \times 10^{-5}) = 1.0 \times 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q &lt; K_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| No, a precipitate will not form.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{.002~g~\hbox{NaCl}}{58~g/mol} = 3.4 \times 10^{-5}~mol~\hbox{Cl}^-&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;Q = (5.9 \times 10^{-6})(3.4 \times 10^{-5}) = 2.0 \times 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;
| Now, another milligram of sodium chloride is dissolved.
|-
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q &gt; K_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| The extra chloride ions will bond with silver ions and form a solid precipitate.
|}

In this case, the precipitate would probably be too small and dilute to be noticed.  As more ions are added, however, the solution will become visibly cloudy.

{{TextBox|1=
;Question for the reader
Calcium carbonate has a K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; of 3.36 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;.  In a 0.01 M solution of calcium chloride (soluble), how many moles of sodium carbonate (also soluble) can be added before precipitates form?}}

This application chapter discusses the use of embedded control systems in home and building automation systems, sometimes called domotics and immotics. A short introduction to home automation systems and their components is followed by an analysis of the evolution of embedded systems in domotics.

==Introduction==
Home automation is a form of building automation, only on a smaller scale and (most of the time) of a lower complexity degree. Both types of systems try to ''fill in the specific automation'' ''requirements of private homes and buildings'', hereby increasing the comfort and security of the users and improving on overall energy efficiency. Not all home automation systems
posses these characteristics, simpler (cheaper) systems only focus on comfort or security.

Home automation systems come from the need of automating processes in the house of e.g.
an immobile elderly person, a handicapped person,...
Building automation systems originate from the simple fact that it is easier to control lots of systems remotely from one place instead of running around, controlling each of these systems manually. 
(HVAC and chilled / hot water systems come to mind)

Now that electronics are becoming more affordable and implemented in people's houses, the
urge for electronic comfort is increasing by the day. Hence the growth of the domotics market.

===Tasks===
Home and building automation systems can perform a magnitude of tasks. Nowadays there is almost no limit to the tasks such an automation system can perform. As long as the task itself is not impossible to perform with current mechanical/electronic systems, the only limit is the customers budget.

Some applications of home automation systems include but are not limited to: 
*Control of lighting
*Control of HVAC
*Control of doors, windows, curtains, gates, …
*Access to and control of security systems
*Access to and control of multimedia systems, home entertainment systems

Since this document discusses embedded control systems in home and building automation systems, it is not necessary to give an accurate view of the tasks than can be completed by such an automation system. More information can be found here: Home automation and building automation.

===Component functions===
Home automation systems commonly exist of several components, which are all part of the complete system. Each of these components can perform a function, some components are multifunctional.

Most components functions can be categorized into 3 categories:
*Input
*Output
*Control

Some components can be used for input, output and control. A multimedia terminal for example can be used for:
*Input (using keyboard, switches, … )
*Output  (display, loudspeakers, … )
*Control (controlling other components like dimming the lights, closing the curtains, …).

In the early days of home automation, a system could be nothing more than a central switching box with timers and some logic modules, with switches wired throughout the house to be used as input and relays / actuators to be used as output.

At the time of writing this document, there is no simple way of categorizing the components of an automation system into input/output/control, since most components incorporate all three functions. Later on in this document this will be the baseline for an analysis of the evolution of home automation systems.

====Input Functions====
Input functions are mostly performed by components called sensors. Sensors can be anything from a simple on/off switch to a capacitive proximity switch to a complex audio/video recognition system.

Some examples of sensors:

* Switch
* Motion sensor
* humidity / pressure sensor
* Light sensor (photodiode, photoresistor )
* Temperature sensor ([thermistor, thermocouple, resistance thermometer, thermostat )
* Video/audio acquisition sensor (video camera, microphone )
* Smoke detector
* Flow sensor
** Fluids (flowmeter, mass flow meter )
** Electricity meter

A lot of the more complex sensors need some electronics to condition the sensor signal and transform it into a signal suitable for the home automation system. 

====Output functions====
Output functions are mostly performed by components called actuators. Actuators use a signal from the automation system to change the state of an object in the controlled environment (e.g. switching AC power to the circuit feeding the light bulbs, moving an object).

Some examples of actuators:
*Electro-mechanical switches ([[wikipedia: Relay | relays]] )
*Electronic controllers:
**[[wikipedia: Dimmer | Dimmers]]
**[[wikipedia: Power switch | Power switches]]
**[[wikipedia: Motor controller | Motor controllers]]
*Mechanical actuators:
**[[wikipedia: Motor | Motor]]
**[[wikipedia: Pneumatic actuator | Pneumatic actuator]]
**[[wikipedia: Linear actuator | Linear actuator]]
**[[wikipedia: Solenoid valve | Solenoid valve]]

To get an actuator to do something useful in an automation system, most of the time it has to be equipped with extra mechanical/electric systems. A stepper motor e.g. won’t do much unless it’s attached to something, a fluid control valve for example. The output function is thus being performed by a combination of a basic actuator in conjunction with some additional systems.

====Control functions====
Control functions are somewhat different than input/output functions in that their functionality itself is not so easy to describe. 
Control functions can be a lot of things, including but not limited to:
*Setting an output after a timer has reached a certain state
*Setting an output after a logical combination of inputs has occurred
*Setting a diversity of outputs after an input occurs
*Contacting an external service when an input occurs ([[wikipedia: Smoke detector | smoke alarm]]/[[wikipedia: Security system | security]] breach)

Control functions are performed by a control unit, but since there are so many different forms of systems and again due to the changing nature of home automation systems in time, it is difficult to describe the system that performs these control functions.
Systems performing control functions can be as simple as a few logical gates or as complex as a full-blown mainframe.

===Communication===
Evidently, there is a need for a communication system between all these components. Since the birth of home and building automation systems, a multitude of standards has popped up.

In the early days of home automation systems, communication occurred over simple copper wiring. There was no need for high data speed or interference shielding. At the time of writing a lot more possibilities exist for communication in such systems.

For example:
*Simple copper wiring (elder days)
*[[wikipedia: Telephone line | Telephone line]]
*[[wikipedia: Parallel communication | Parallel communication]]
*[[wikipedia: Serial communication | Serial communication]]
*[[wikipedia: Coax | Coax]]
*[[wikipedia: Infrared | Infrared]]
*[[wikipedia: Twisted pair | Twisted pair cable]]
*Electric powerlines:
**[[wikipedia: Power line communication | Power line communication]]
**[[wikipedia: X10 industry standard | X10]]
**[[wikipedia: INSTEON | INSTEON]]
**[[wikipedia: Universal powerline bus | Universal powerline bus]]
*[[wikipedia: Fibre optics| Fibre optics]]
*[[wikipedia: Wireless | Wireless]]

All these communication means have their own characteristics, discussing them falls out of the scope of this document.
Which standard uses which communication method can be found on the general Wiki page about [[wikipedia: Home automation | Home automation]].

==Embedded control systems in Home / Building automation systems==
===Design characteristics===

First of all a short list of embedded control system design characteristics and their application to the current subject of home/building automation systems. These are the characteristics a design engineer has to keep in mind when designing such an automation system:


'''High importance characteristics''':

*''Focused functionality'': a home/building automation system typically has one fixed set of functionalities, and its design is optimized for this specific set. An example set of functionalities consist of improving user comfort and security while saving energy

*''Boot-up time'': home automation systems are supposed to be in working state at all times. Timers keep ticking, lights need to be switched on/off immediately, …

*''Safe failure modes'': domotics can fail but there should be a provision for safe failure in emergency states such as power spikes, loss of power, break-down of components. When failing a home automation system should give back control to the users of the home without for example closing down the house and switching off all the lights.

*''Communication'': since most recent home/building automation systems consist of a large number of subsystems, there is an inherent need for communication between these subsystems.

*''Energy consumption'': low energy consumption is necessary since the newer energy-friendly home automation systems strive to lower the house’s energy usage (e.g. by planning energy-consuming tasks at night or closing the curtains on time to save on heating fuel)

*''System adaptibility'': 
**Most recent automation systems require custom installations and settings due to the uniqueness of the house / building. Therefore the installer should be able to choose the necessary components for the current configuration, combine them to a working system and set them up to his/her or the end-user's wishes.
**Most recent automation systems are capable of working on a higher abstraction level (see further in this document). Therefore the user should be able to adjust such an automation system, setting up his/her own 'mood settings', room configurations, colour tastes, voice recognition, ... without the help of an installer / customer service.


'''Medium importance characteristics''':

*''Space constraints'': the ideal home/building automation system takes up no space in the home/building it controls, it should be invisible except for the input/output.

*''Long life time'': home automation systems must be in working state as long as possible since costs to replace it are higher than replacement costs for simple appliances (e.g. breaking into wall to insert new cables vs. replacing a coffee machine).

*''Cost'': cost is getting more and more important with rising prices (including heating oil, building materials etc.). So a low-cost home automation system is more attractive. On the higher end of the scale cost is less important since the high-end domotics systems are semi-custom built for that customer and most of the time very expensive.

*''Temperature and humidity'': sensors and/or actuators for outdoor use can be succumbed to high temperature (sunlight) or high humidity (rain). Protection against temperature and humidity is necessary for components for outdoor use and components for use in bathrooms / swimming pools / sauna / …

*''Shocks and vibrations'': components of automation systems must be able to withstand small shocks and vibrations coming from users abuse etc. but most of them are not protected to prolonged exposure to shock / vibrations.

*''EMC'': embedded systems in home/building automation should not be disturbed by (nor disturb themselves) other devices in their environment.

*''Remote servicing'': since more and more of the components in home/building automation systems use a mixed software/hardware setup, there is a need to be able to monitor each component and upgrade the software part of it remotely. 

*''Superior quality'': most users expect their home automation systems to work all the time, without bugs or errors. Since quite a large part of today’s home automation components consist of recent electronics in combination with software to control the electronics, the expectancy for perfect quality is not as high as it could be. However for the high-end automation systems there is a correlation between cost and quality expectancy, making build quality more important.

*''Watchdogs'': in case of failure the system needs to reset itself so that the user does not need to interact.
We discuss watchdogs more in [[Embedded Control Systems Design/Design Patterns#Watchdog timer]].

'''Low importance characteristics''':

*''Dependability by redundancy'': some application domains request 100% robustness against failure of hardware or software components, which requires these components to be provided multiple times. This, however, is not the case for home/building automation systems. Doing so would eradicate the low cost characteristic.

*''Space hardened'': Not applicable to home/building automation systems (no home/building automation systems in space yet)

===System complexity===
Since there has been a large evolution in home/building automation systems it follows that there has also been an evolution in the technologies used in these systems.

Home/building automation systems span a few decades already and the available technologies evolved over time. Categorizing home/building automation systems in general is very difficult thanks to the change in used technologies.

Therefore an analysis of these systems during their evolution seems in place. On the whole these automation systems can be said to belong to one of following three categories:
*Category 1: ''Centralized hardware – centralized software''
*Category 2: ''Distributed hardware – centralized software''
*Category 3: ''Distributed hardware – distributed software''

The trend that can be seen in the evolution of home/building automation system is that they evolve from category 1 to 3 throughout their existence.

More general information concerning the categories can be found in the section [[Embedded Control Systems_Design/Categories of system complexity | Categories of system complexity]].

====Category 1: ''Centralized hardware – centralized software''====

''picture schematically describing the centralized/centralized character''

The first category is also the one that occurred most in the early days of home/building automation systems. Due to available technologies (the beginning of the semiconductor era) it seemed logical to have a centralized hardware/software setup. This consisted of 1 rack or machine which contained nearly all the necessary hardware and, if applicable, software parts of the system.

A simple switching box with some timers and logical circuits would be sufficient if provided with e.g. switches as inputs and relays as outputs. 
Later on, when PLC’s were getting into play, systems got a little more complicated, but it was still of the same centralized type.

=====Pro/con=====
*An advantage of this type of system is that there is no complex hardware/software involved in the system (no operating system needed), making the system straight-forward to design, implement and maintain.

*A disadvantage however is the complexity of the cabling from and to the central machine. When numbers of inputs and outputs go up, so does the number of cables. With larger buildings the lengths (and thus cost) of the cables can become an argument to opt for another complexity of system.

*Another disadvantage is the lack of flexibility when using such a system. When using a PLC for example, a flexible program will have to be written or the software code will have to be adapted with each hardware update. The necessity to install new cables for each extra input/output is also not very flexible, it rather makes this type of systems suitable for installation when building or upgrading the house/building but unsuitable for installing when the house/building is already built and finished.

=====Abstraction level=====
The user abstraction level of this type of systems is rather low. This means that for the simplest of these systems the user directly controls the outputs with one input or a logical combination of inputs, the more complex using multiple inputs and timers to set the outputs. For example a user switches a zone of lighting on or off, sets the house to night mode (close the curtains, switch off all the lights except the one outside by the door, …). 

In systems with a higher abstraction level the user could, for example, switch the living room to ‘Romantic mode’ or ‘Movie mode’. These kind of abstractions are difficult to program on the simpler category 1 systems (since they are quite inflexible), going up in system complexity eases the task of implementing higher abstraction levels.

=====Communication=====
This type of system mostly uses standard electrical wiring (low voltage for the inputs, low/high voltage for the outputs). Since there is no communication between different components of the system other than a voltage difference used for inputs/outputs, there is no need for a specific communication protocol.

====Category 2: ''Distributed hardware – centralized software''====

''picture schematically describing the distributed/centralized character''

The second category consists of the type of systems found in most lower to middle class home/building automation systems of today and the high end systems of earlier.

They consist of a central controller (mostly an embedded processor or a PC type controller) which runs specific software on an operating system (specific or generic, depends on the implementation). This central controller is then connected to a field bus or busses, which connect it to its hardware peripherals. 

The hardware peripherals can also have an embedded processor, but they do not run an operating system.
The software can be found only on the central controller, which uses the field bus to communicate with its peripherals and gather inputs / set outputs.

=====Pro/con=====
*A big advantage of this type of system is its flexibility software-wise. The central controller can easily be reprogrammed for another setup, new peripheral additions, system upgrades, … Since software only resides on the central controller, only the central controller has to be updated.

*The fact that the system complexity is a little higher can be an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on the context (developer(s) experience, manpower, development budget, …). When experience and budget (time-wise and financially) allow, this higher system complexity allows for more variated functionality, higher abstraction levels and higher flexibility. When experience and budget aren’t up to the job, the higher complexity can be a big time-eater in the development process. So in short, design and implementation of this type of system requires more manpower, experience and budget when comparing to a category 1 system.

*An advantage is the fact that shorter and less complex cabling can be used. Inputs/outputs for each room can be routed to a room interface module which is connected to the field bus. Only the field bus then connects the interface module and the central controller. This saves some installation trouble and it also simplifies expansion of the room’s inputs/outputs if the interface module allows for expansion.

*Another advantage over category 1 systems is the flexibility hardware-wise. As long as the newly added/upgraded hardware peripheral is compatible with the field bus protocol, no extensive hardware changes are necessary. Only the software needs to be updated.

*A disadvantage for this type of system is that it is bound to a specific field bus, which means there’s still a cable running through the house/building. This compromises interoperability between different manufacturers, different field bus generations, …
The hardware peripherals are not very sophisticated, they only consist of a hardware layer, no software involved. This is benificient for the robustness of the hardware peripherals but compromises the system’s flexibility.

=====Abstraction level=====
In comparison with category 1 systems, a higher abstraction level can be achieved. It’s easier to implement on the more powerful central controller, but still the software is quite problem specific and the ‘abstraction levels’ need to be programmed into the software. This does not make for a user-friendly input for these ‘abstraction levels’ since the user needs to update the software of the central controller manually to implement them.

In systems of category 3, if implemented, the user can setup his or her own ‘abstraction levels’ at user interfaces throughout the house, without having to meddle with the central controller’s software. This is not possible for category 2 systems (in a strict sense) because there is no bi-directional communication between central controller and hardware peripherals.

=====Communication=====
A multitude of field busses have been developed for the sole purpose of serving in home/building automation systems, including e.g. Batibus. Naming all field busses ever used for these systems and describing them is beyond the scope of this document.

Also it would not be correct to list domotic standards here since most of these standards use multiple means of communication, mixing category 2 and 3 communication methods. 

====Category 3: ''Distributed hardware – distributed software''====

''picture schematically describing the distributed/distributed character''

The third type of systems is found in the newest home/building automation systems and some of the most expensive older systems. 
Here a total home/building automation system consists of multiple sub-systems of category 1 or 2, linked together using a software and communication layer. Communication between these sub-systems can occur via a lot of different networking technologies (RF, wireless, optical, …). 

While systems of category 1 or 2 were synchronous, most category 3 systems work in an asynchronous way, due to every subsystem having its own controller (with or without an operating system).

For example: every room in a house is a sub-system of category 2, controlling the lighting, the curtains, the multi-media content, the temperature, … Every room has its own controller used for setting inputs or outputting music/video/security info/… Each room is controlled by the room’s controller while there are controllers which can control a room’s controller. 

For example when going on a vacation, every room has to switch off the power as to save as much energy possible, but it might come in handy to have a light on in a random room every night as to give the impression somebody’s home. The room’s controller must then have some priority scheme to decide which command to listen to.

=====Pro/con=====
*A disadvantage for this type of system is the high complexity of the total system, requiring a lot of manpower, experience and budget to develop and implement such a system. This includes protocol compatibility, sub-system software and hardware compatibility, multiple products using different software for different functionality, …

*An advantage is the multitude of available communication methods and the possibility of mixing them in the total system, making the system very flexible for various installation types and updates at a time after installation completion.

*An advantage is the flexibility when updating software since sub-system by sub-system can be updated without shutting down the whole system.

*Another advantage is the reliability of the total system. If the controller of one room fails, then only that room would be incontrollable (if it is not controllable from the next room or from a central controller). If there are 2 controllers in 1 room and one fails, then the room would still be functionally accessible through the other controller.

*An advantage can also be found in the fact that the system can be highly ‘customized’ to suit the user’s needs due to the widely embedded software and controllers on a higher abstraction level.

=====Abstraction level=====
With systems of category 3, the highest degree of abstraction can be attained due to their high processing power and extensive software flexibility. The hardware is more of a generic kind while the software makes up for the functionality of the different components.

''picture of a high abstraction level interface for home automation systems''

A highly user-friendly interface which can control different abstraction layers aids the user greatly to implement his or her custom ‘abstraction levels’. If the user likes soft jazzy music, dimmed lights, the curtains closed, the hearth lit etc. when he’s having a romantic evening, he could program a ‘Romantic’ abstraction program which, when called, closes the curtains, switches off television, puts on some soft jazzy music, dims the lights and lights the hearth.

This type of system is very suitable for high level automation control, but this also means that the software has to be flexible and robust, even more than in categories 2 and 1. This doesn’t get any better since the user will have a lot more interaction with this kind of system than with simpler types of systems.

=====Communication=====
These systems use a mix of different communication technologies, including twisted pair, electrical wiring, radio frequency, coaxial, optical, …

An overview of these different communication technologies and which standard uses which technology is out of the scope of this document, but information about these can be found on their respective Wikipedia page or on the general [[wikipedia: Home automation | home automation page]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Throughout history there have been many different theories and changing ideas about the universe, building upon and contradicting each other. Great minds have measured the planets and calculated their distance and movements. One of the early societies that was famed for the accuracy and inventiveness of their theories was that of Ancient Greece. 

As early as 230BC, Aristarchus of Samos suggested a heliocentric model of the universe and correctly ordered the planets in distance from the sun. His ideas were not accepted and mainstream and mathematicians such as Aristotle still supported a geocentric model. Aristotle’s contributions to astronomy covered theorems about the substance of the stars and their philosophy. For all of the ancient world and much of the modern, astronomy and astrology were intermingled and indistinguishable. Ptolemy was born over 200 years after Aristarchus’s and Aristotle’s death. Greek by birth, he lived and studied in Roman Egypt. He based his models on existing observations, using methods developed by the Babylonians. His geocentric proposal was widely accepted until Copernicus’s time. It proposed that the earth was stationary and the stars and each of the planets rotated around it in spheres.

Copernicus was born in Poland in 1473 almost 1400 years after Ptolemy. His most profound contribution was to challenge the geocentric model and propose a heliocentric one citing Aristarchus. He proposed that the sun was the centre of the universe and ordered the planets around it. Tycho Brahe did not adopt Copernicus’s model but designed an altered geocentric one, in which the sun orbited the earth and the other planets orbited the sun. This was the model accepted by the church when conventional geocentrism was implausible but Copernican heliocentrism considered sacrilegious. Johannes Kepler, a contemporary of both Copernicus and Brahe, Was the first to suggest that the planets moved in ellipses. He also discussed observations and theories with Galileo.

Galileo, born 1564, supported Copernicus’s theories. He is famous for his methods, which were very observation and experiment based rather than the abstract approach of the ancients. He also combined mathematics and science, which had previously been thought of as different pursuits. His dedication to observation and study, lead him to question the authority of the philosophers and theologians in the field of science. This was a new and dangerous idea. Designing his own telescopes, he discovered satellites of other planets and suggested that they were orbiting these planets. He also discovered sunspots and lunar craters. Newton was born in 1643, in England. He is most famous for discovering gravity and proposing that it affected far away stars and planets. He also had a great impact on telescopy, enabling for more accurate observation. He supported a heliocentric model of the solar system and showed how it would be possible with his laws of motion and theories on gravity.

==Ptolemy's Model==

Ptolemy- they lived from 90–168AD in Roman Egypt. He based his calculations on existing observations made by his predecessors and used methods developed by the Babylonians. In the ancient world, there were catalogues of constellations that have been developed in Babylonia. These detailed the twelve zodiac regions and their movements relative to the sun’s position during the year. Ptolemy understood how the earth related spatially to other bodies and in his Almagest he laid the foundations for modern trigonometry. His work was taken as the definitive source for so many years because he organised such a massive body of information into a clear format. However, he lived in an age where science, maths, philosophy and religion were intertwined. His model of planetary movements was based on the Apollonian one. It works on the theory that the planets, moon, and sun move in spheres around the earth, though not necessarily with the earth at the centre. This accounts for the bizarre motions of the planets as seen from the earth, explained now by the sun being at the centre of the solar system.

      <comment>/* Acceleration of a Rigid Body */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Acceleration of a Rigid Body==

The linear and angular accelerations are the time derivatives of the linear and angular velocity vectors at any instant:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \dot{v} = \dfrac{d \, _a v}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{_a v(t + \Delta t) - \,_a v(t)}{\Delta t}
&lt;/math&gt;,
and:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \dot{\omega} = \dfrac{d \, _a \omega}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{_a \omega(t + \Delta t) - \,_a \omega(t)}{\Delta t}
&lt;/math&gt;

The linear velocity, as seen from a reference frame &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, of a vector &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, relative to frame &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; of which the origin coincides with &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a v_q = \, ^b _a R \, _b v_q + \, _a \omega_b \times \, ^b _a R \, _b q
&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the above expression gives the acceleration of the vector &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \dot{v}_q = \dfrac{d}{dt} \, ^b _a R \, _b v_q + \, _a \dot{\omega}_b \times \, _a ^b R \, _b q + \, _a \omega_b \times \dfrac{d}{dt} \, ^b _a R \, _b q
&lt;/math&gt;

The equation for the linear velocity may also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a v_q = \dfrac{d}{dt} \, ^b _a R \, _b q = \, ^b _a R \, _b v_q + \, _a \omega_b \times \, ^b _a R \, _b q
&lt;/math&gt;

Applying this result to the acceleration leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \dot{v}_q = ^b _a R \, _b \dot{v}_q + \, _a \omega_b \times \, ^b _a R \, _b v_q + \, _a \dot{\omega}_b \times \, _a ^b R \, _b q + \, _a \omega_b \times \left( ^b _a R \, _b v_q + \, _a \omega_b \times \, ^b _a R \, _b q \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

In the case the origins of &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; do not coincide, a term for the linear acceleration of &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, is added:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \dot{v}_q = \, _a \dot{v}_{b,org} + \, ^b _a R \, _b \dot{v}_q + \, _a \omega_b \times \, ^b _a R \, _b v_q + \, _a \dot{\omega}_b \times \, _a ^b R \, _b q + \, _a \omega_b \times \left( ^b _a R \, _b v_q + \, _a \omega_b \times \, ^b _a R \, _b q \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

For rotational joints, &lt;math&gt;_b q&lt;/math&gt; is constant, and the above expression simplifies to:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \dot{v}_q = \, _a \dot{v}_{b,org} + \, _a \dot{\omega}_b \times \, _a ^b R \, _b q + \, _a \omega_b \times \left( _a \omega_b \times \, ^b _a R \, _b q \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The angular velocity of a frame &lt;math&gt;\{c\}&lt;/math&gt;, rotating relative to a frame &lt;math&gt;\{b\}&lt;/math&gt;, which in itself is rotating relative to the reference frame &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, with respect to &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \omega_c = \, _a \omega_b + \, _a ^b R \, _b \omega_c
&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \dot{\omega}_c = \, _a \dot{\omega}_b + \dfrac{d}{dt} \, _a ^b R \, _b \omega_c
&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing the last term with one of the expressions derived earlier:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a \dot{\omega}_c = \, _a \dot{\omega}_b + \, _a \omega_b \times \, _a ^b R \, _b \omega_c
&lt;/math&gt;

==Inertia Tensor==
The [[wikipedia:Moment of inertia#Moment_of_inertia_tensor|inertia tensor]] can be thought of as a generalization of the scalar moment of inertia:
:&lt;math&gt;
_a I = \begin{pmatrix}
I_{xx} &amp; -I_{xy} &amp; -I_{xz} \\
I_{xy} &amp; I_{zz} &amp; -I_{yz} \\
I_{xz} &amp; -I_{yz} &amp; I_{zz} \\
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Newton's and Euler's equation==
The force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;, acting at the center of mass of a rigid body with total mass&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, causing an acceleration &lt;math&gt;\dot{v}_{com}&lt;/math&gt;, equals:
:&lt;math&gt;
F = m \dot{v}_{com}
&lt;/math&gt;

In a similar way, the moment &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, causing an angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\dot{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
N = \, _c I \dot{\omega} + \omega \, _c I \omega
&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;_c I&lt;/math&gt; is the inertia tensor, expressed in a frame &lt;math&gt;\{c\}&lt;/math&gt; of which the origin coincides with the center of mass of the rigid body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The source code for plug-in development consists of the class definitions for all of the interface classes between Opticks and the plug-in, the class definitions for the plug-in base classes, a module definition file, and the default ModuleManager C++ source code.

The plug-in library contains compiled code that must be linked with the plug-in at compile time.  The library contains the implementation of the plug-in base classes.  The library's base filename is 'PlugInLib'.  The library has been compiled for Windows and Solaris.  The exact name of the library file depends on the naming conventions for the different operating systems.  For Windows, the library is PlugInLib.lib and for the Solaris operating systems, the library is libpluginlib.a.  Regardless of the operating system being used, this library must be statically linked into the plug-in.

The toolkit contains five sample plug-ins in a single module.  One of the five sample plug-ins is only available on the Windows platform.  The sample module and plug-in source code are contained in the /Toolkit/SamplePlugIns directory.  They demonstrate a variety of functionality that plug-in may need to implement.  The module contains full source code for all plug-ins and a project file for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Autism and Technology ==
&lt;br&gt;
'''Introduction'''

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The acquisition of language is one of the most important events in child development. Through language, one is able to communicate their thoughts, feelings and ideas in ways that, through gesture alone, we simply cannot. Although debates between Environmentalist and Nativist theorists have been long-standing, neither argues that for most children, learning to speak is a relatively ordinary process, which develops at a similar (albeit, individual) rate (Sroufe, Cooper, &amp; DeHart, 1996). However, for the growing population of children diagnosed with autism, acquiring language is not so natural (Larney, 2002). This population of youngsters generally has delays in receptive and expressive language acquisition, or may never become verbal (Butler, 1999). For these children, communication is a difficult feat. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;As the number of mainstreamed children with autism in primary classrooms grows, how can teachers accommodate their successful language acquisition? What can be done to ensure that children with autism receive language instruction that is equitable, considering their very different needs? This paper will explore typical and autistic language acquisition, along with the benefits of computer technology in the classroom as a language intervention for children with autism.


'''Typical Language Acquisition'''

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Language learning typically begins very early in life. Long before a child is able to purposefully articulate a word to convey an idea, he or she will experiment with different functions of speech (Kuhn, Siegler, Damon, &amp; Lerner, 2006). From birth until approximately twelve months of age, infants engage in five different forms of prelinguistic vocalization. The first of these is the baby’s primary form of communication: crying. Although it seems obvious that an infant will cry to convey any sort of need or distress, what is quite remarkable is that the baby will cry differently to signal different types of discomfort (Sroufe et al., 1996).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Around the two month mark, infants will begin to make noises when expressing pleasure. These noises, called “cooing”, are composed mainly of vowel sounds (Sroufe et al., 1996). Cooing leads in to the next stage in prelinguistic vocalization, in which babies engage in vocal play. During this stage, infants will experiment with the pitch and volume of their voices (Hoff-Ginsberg, 1997). 
	
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The fourth stage, called “canonical babbling”, is when babies’ vocalizations really begin to sound like speech. During canonical babbling, which occurs at around six months of age, infants begin to make consonant-vowel combinations, like “ba-ba-ba” and “di-da-di” (Ingram, 1989). Until this point in their language development, babies are not yet constrained to the phonemes of their native language. Studies have shown that babies who are deaf from birth, progress at about the same rate up until this fourth stage. Deaf infants are generally slower, however, at producing the consonant-vowel sounds which define the canonical babbling stage. It is therefore thought that the sounds made in the first three stages of prelinguistic vocalization are limited to infants’ physical abilities to speak, while the consonant-vowel combinations of the canonical babbling stage are more affected by what babies hear around them (Sroufe et al., 1996). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Conversational babbling, or jargon, is the fifth stage of prelinguistic vocalization. During this stage, the intonation and stress a child uses in his or her not-yet-intelligible speech, mimics that of adult language (Sroufe et al., 1996). For example, a child may raise their tone at the end of a string of babbled “words”, clearly signalling a question. The babbling also begins to mimic the child’s native language, in that he or she will use certain sounds more often than others, depending on the sounds most often heard in their native language (Sroufe et al., 1996). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Around the one year mark, many children begin to say their first words. They start to use one-word sentences, or holophrases, to make requests (Hoff-Ginsberg, 1997). At approximately two years of age, toddlers go through a vocabulary spurt, during which they acquire new words at a very fast pace. Around this same time, their holophrases turn into two-word sentences, generally composed of nouns, adjectives, and verbs. This is called “telegraphic speech”, because the child uses the fewest words necessary to convey an idea (Kuhn et al., 2006). Once a child has entered the telegraphic speech stage of language acquisition, their understanding of syntax and other linguistic components also begins to expand (Sroufe et al., 1996). They do, however, continue to make linguistic errors, such as “overregularization”, which occurs when the child uses rules for past tense and pluralizing, to irregular verbs and nouns (James, 1990)– thus, “go” may become “goed” and “mouse” may be pluralized as “mouses”. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A distinction should be made between a child’s expressive and receptive vocabularies. Children typically have much larger receptive vocabularies, meaning that they can understand many more words than they are able to produce (Sroufe et al., 1996). It is therefore not at all unusual for a toddler to be able to follow commands long before they are able to say very many words. It is important to remember that there is a lot of individual variation in the pace at which all children acquire both expressive and receptive language. Cause for concern may arise when a child’s language development lags far behind the norm, or when their expressive or receptive language is significantly impaired.


'''Language Acquisition in Autism'''

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Impairments in linguistic communication are a major feature of autism. About 50% of all children with autism never develop useful language skills, and the other half learn to speak significantly later than typically developing children. Some begin to speak, but lose this ability in infancy. Others are able to acquire a varied vocabulary, but will use language in an awkward manner (Mash &amp; Wolfe, 2005). For example, they may string together words which do not form a coherent sentence, or they may say things out of context. Many children with autism develop delayed or immediate echolalia, which is a repetition of a word or sentence that the child has heard (Ozonoff, Rogers, &amp; Birtha, 2003). Pronoun reversal is also very common, especially with the words “I” and “you”. When asked, “What do you want to eat?” a child with autism may reply, “You want macaroni and cheese”.  Those with sufficient language skills may continuously talk about their interests. This is referred to as “perseverative speech” (Mash &amp; Wolfe, 2005).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is imperative that children diagnosed with autism begin a therapy program with a large language acquisition component immediately. Early intervention is one of the most important factors in the linguistic success of a child with autism (Lord &amp; Spence, 2006). But in order for a treatment program to be successful, the child has to be attentive, interested, and willing to participate. As classroom teachers, how can we aid in the language acquisition of mainstreamed autistic children, who are becoming more and more common in today’s classrooms? One method that has been found to be effective is the integration of computer software programs in addition to teacher instruction.


'''Autism and Computer Technology'''

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is a fairly large body of literature attesting to the fact that children with autism greatly benefit from computer technology in their education (e.g., Calvert, 1999; Heimann, Nelson, Tjus, &amp; Gillberg, 1995; Maurice, Green, &amp; Luce, 1996; Moore &amp; Calvert, 2000, (Bosseler &amp; Massaro, 2003; Hetzroni &amp; Tannous, 2004; Passerino &amp; Santarosa, 2008; Williams, Wright, Callaghan, &amp; Coughlan, 2002). Computer programs that are meant to aid in the language acquisition of children with autism are intrinsically motivating, since they are designed to capture the child’s attention and provide reinforcements, such as sound effects and graphics, targeted specifically at children with autism (Calvert, 1999). In addition, many programs have features that allow a parent, teacher, or therapist to individualize the program to suit the needs of the specific child and to target their particular weaknesses. This is important, since the broad spectrum of autism causes these individuals to have varying degrees of ability. 
The motivational deficit hypothesis points out that children with autism suffer from a global lack of motivation (Jarrold, Boucher, &amp; Smith, 1993). The exact reasons for the lack of motivation are uncertain. Some believe that children with autism have unusual reinforcer hierarchies and therefore receive greater reinforcement from repetitive, self-stimulatory behaviour, known as stimming (Jarrold et al., 1993). Others suggest that these children have a hard time carrying out certain actions due to attention difficulties, a history of task failure, or competing behaviours (Stahmer, 1995). Due to the interesting nature of the programs, along with little to no opportunity for task failure, it has been found that children with autism tend to focus better and remain more attentive to instruction when they are using the computer, as opposed to simply listening to a teacher. In addition, many computer programs made especially for individuals with autism are programmed in a way that reduces self-stimulatory behaviour while still offering reinforcement for positive actions (Hetzroni &amp; Tannous, 2004). For example, if a child clicks on a certain word in a vocabulary game, an animated character may come out and do a short dance. To prevent the child from continuously clicking on the same word for the purposes of stimming, the program may be designed so that something else happens when a word is clicked a second time. The child is therefore more likely to continue with the game or program, rather than getting stuck at one point and being unable to move on.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The intrinsically motivating properties of computers help children with autism to increase their attention spans during lessons. In an experiment by Moore and Calvert (2000), in which a computer program that they designed to help autistic children gain a larger vocabulary was tested against teacher instruction, it was found that the children in the computer group were attentive 97% of the time, compared to only 62% of the time with a teacher. The success of Moore and Calvert’s (2000) specific program was rooted in the fact that behavioural approaches to the treatment of autism, such as immediate reinforcement of positive behaviour, was combined with graphics, sounds, and colours along with a lot of opportunity for success. The combination of multisensory stimuli has been shown to improve memory for new vocabulary (Bosseler &amp; Massaro, 2003). This is true not only for children with autism. “The potential to present multiple sources of information, such as text, sound and images, in parallel” (Bosseler &amp; Massaro, 2003) makes computer programs effective, as well as fun and exciting for children, thus keeping their attention and allowing them to benefit more fully from the instruction (Doherty &amp; Rosenfeld, 1984).

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is likely due to the high rates of motivation to interact with computers that other interesting findings have been recorded regarding the use of computer technology in intervention programs for autistic children. Not only do the children pay greater attention when using a computer, but there is an increase in task completion and accuracy of answers to questions regarding what they have learned (Chen &amp; Bernard-Opitz, as cited in Hetzroni &amp; Tannous, 2004). In addition, there seems to be an rise in the autonomy levels of some individuals. This may be due to the fact that using the computer allows the child to make their own decisions and, in essence, take greater control of their learning than when simply listening to a teacher and performing requested tasks (Passerino &amp; Santarosa, 2008). Teaching independence is a major goal in intervention programs for autistic children. 
For children who already have some functional language ability, using computer programs to aid in communication is beneficial. In a study by Hetzroni and Tannous (2004), after a few weeks of using a computer program aimed at improving communication, autistic children who had some verbal ability were better able to use the vocabulary that they already had. Their immediate and delayed echolalia decreased significantly, and their use of appropriate speech increased. There was also an increase in initiation of conversations; something rarely seen in children with classic autism. What is perhaps most important is that the children in the study were able to generalize the skills that they learned to real-life settings. Generalization of skills is a difficulty faced by most individuals with autism and with most intervention programs. In Hetzroni and Tannous’ (2004) study, their particular computer program included simulations of various natural settings and situations, such as brushing teeth in a bathroom. These realistic settings allowed the children in the study to be able to use the learned vocabulary in real life. It would have been interesting to see whether the vocabulary was generalized to locations other than those used in the computer simulations.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Although it seems that the use of computers for children with autism is highly beneficial, computers should not take the place of teachers and therapists, but rather complement their work (Passerino &amp; Santarosa, 2008). Teacher instruction is still necessary, as real life interactions are important. In order for children to gain full benefits from computer interventions, it is essential that the teachers, parents, and therapists are properly trained in the use of the programs (Williams et al., 2002). In addition, just like other therapies for children with autism, the computer programs must be used daily in order for the students to show any progress. In a study by Lovaas (1987), it was noticed that teachers found it difficult to allow their students to use the programs daily. This was because, as the children got better at the tasks on the computer, the teachers assumed that the work had become too easy for them. However, children with autism need a lot of repetition as it takes them longer to learn new skills, and they tend to lose these skills quickly without practise.


'''Conclusion'''

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The language acquisition of children with autism can be supported by computer technology. The computer is not meant to replace teachers, but rather to act as a resource and tutor for the child. The reinforcing qualities of computer programs designed to help autistic children learn language, make them an excellent addition to any classroom with autistic children.

You can easily create '''subsections''', just by right clicking to '''add''' a section while your mouse is over the higher level section.


[[Image:Qw3Pro add section.jpg|center]]

When you have added the section, if you right click you can open the section's properties window.  You can then add the information for that section.


[[Image:QW3 Section properties.jpg|center]]


You can give each section a title, to help you when organizing your quiz and you can vary the time allowed for completion of each section.  You can choose whether or not to apply randomization to each section.  If you wish to group questions for your own organizational reasons, but don't want the questions to appear to the quiz taker in this same grouping you can tick the '''Flatten section...''' box.  For more information on using randomization in sections a short video tutorial is available here: [http://www.questionwriter.com/tutorial/sections/].{{clr}}

For example you want to set a quiz with easy, medium and hard questions and randomly select 30 questions from a pool of 90.  You will want the generated quiz to have 10 easy, 10 medium and 10 hard questions.  Even with a random selection of questions you can guarantee the balance by grouping the questions under 3 sections (Easy, Medium and Hard) and then choosing to ask 10 questions selected randomly from each section.

You can easily achieve this by leaving these questions outside the sections, and apply randomization as part of the section properties.

&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The setlocale() function is used to set and retrieve the current locale. If ''locale'' is '''NULL''', the current locale is returned. Otherwise, ''locale'' is used to set the locale for the given ''category''.

''category'' can have the following values:

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  '''Value''' !! '''Description'''
|-
| LC_ALL || All of the locale
|-
| LC_TIME || Date and time formatting
|-
| LC_NUMERIC || Number formatting
|-
| LC_COLLATE || String collation and regular expression matching
|-
| LC_CTYPE || Regular expression matching, conversion, case-sensitive comparison, wide character functions, and character classification.
|-
| LC_MONETARY || For monetary formatting
|-
| LC_MESSAGES || For natural language messages
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Some things to note:'''
#This tense (and all perfect tenses) uses a form of the irregular helping verb ''haber'' (meaning to have done). As this is the future perfect indicative, it takes the simple future indicative form of ''haber''.
#The past participle of a regular verb is formed by adding -''ado'' to the stem of an -AR verb, and -''ido'' to the stem of an -ER or -IR verb.
#As the structure for this tense is a form of ''haber'' with the past participle, '''there are no irregular verbs in this tense'''. Any irregularity would come from a verb with an irregular past participle, but the ''haber'' + past participle structure still holds true.
#While the past participle is oftentimes the same word as the adjective form of a verb (''las palabras &lt;u&gt;habladas&lt;/u&gt;'' - the &lt;u&gt;spoken&lt;/u&gt; words), the past participle itself is not an adjective, and therefore does not have to &quot;agree&quot; with the subject. '''Regardless of the subject's gender or number, the past participle remains the same.''' ''Ellas habrán hablado'', NOT ''ellas habrán habladas''.
#Be careful not to confuse the past participle with the gerund. ''habré hablado'', not ''habré habla'''n'''do''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Themes==

The simplest way to change the look of your quiz is to choose a new '''theme'''.   This is very easy to do.

Both the Standard and Professional versions of Question Writer come with a range of themes.

You can find out when new themes are released by subscribing to the Question Writer Newsletter, or you can read the regular updates on the blog. [http://www.questionwriterblog.com]


[[Image:QW3Themes.png|center]]

 
To add or change the theme, click the 'Switch Themes' button.   A list of themes will appear and you can select a different theme.  A dialogue box will appear telling you that the theme has been changed.  


[[Image:QW3Themeslist.jpg|center]]


You can then '''Preview''' the quiz to see how it looks with the new theme.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Include Image==

You can add an image to each individual question by ticking the 'Add Image' checkbox in the question property details.  You can follow the same steps to add audio or video content to your quiz.  


[[Image:QW3Add_image.png|center]]


To '''add an image''', simply tick the include image box and then use the browser to select and insert the image of your choice.  The image should be in a .jpg or .gif format.  Once you have selected the image you want using the '''Add Files...''' button you click the '''Use File''' button and the image will appear in your question.

[[Image:QW3Image.jpg|center]]


If you want quiz takers to be able zoom the image with their mouse, tick the 'Use Image Zooming' checkbox in [[Question_Writer_Manual/Quiz_Options/Question_Options/General_Question_Properties|General Question Properties]].

If you right click on the answer option on the relevant answer, and select '''Add''' then '''Content'''.  By right clicking on '''Content''' you can then select '''Image'''.   A window will open where you can add the image file that you need.


[[Image:QW4 Add image content.jpg|center]]


Adding images in this way gives you the option of setting the size of the image and it's alignment in the page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Adding Flash Animation==

You can add flash animations to a question by creating your animation with a Flash tool, exporting it as Flash 8 (or earlier) and attaching it to your question.  You add your Flash animation file in the same way as you would add an image, see the section on [[../../About Questions/Adding Questions|Adding Questions]] for more information.

Image zooming also applies to Flash content - if you want quiz takers to be able zoom the Flash content with their mouse, tick the 'Use Image Zooming' checkbox in the Question Options [[../../Quiz Options/Question Options/General Question Properties|General Question Properties]]. Usually if the Flash is interactive, you'll want this switched off.

Using Flash content is a good way to include audio and video in your quiz.

The steps that you will take to add audio to a question will vary depending on which version of Question Writer you are using.  If you are using Question Writer 3 please follow this [[Question Writer Manual/Look and Feel/Adding Audio/Question Writer 3|link]].

You can add audio files to both the Question and to the Answer options (if you are a user with a Professional license) and the files can be in either MP3 or .swf format.  

===Adding Audio to a Question===

There are two possible ways that you can add audio to a Question, though the second method is only available to users with a Professional license.

The first method is to follow the steps for [[Question Writer Manual/Look_and_Feel/Include_Image|adding an image]], only instead of an image file you add your audio file.

|-
| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | [[Image:QW3 Pro star icon.png]]
| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |The second method is to right click on your question and select '''Add - Content'''


[[File:QW4 Question content.jpg|center]]


and then '''Add-Audio''' and select your audio file.  


[[File:QW4 Question content choices.jpg|center]]


If you use this method you can adjust the alignment of the audio player in the page.

===Adding Audio to Answer Options===

| style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot; | [[Image:QW3 Pro star icon.png]]
| style=&quot;border-left: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 5px;&quot; |You can add audio to answer options in Partial Credit, Matching, Sequencing and Plugin Question types.

To add audio to the Answer Options follow the steps shown in [[Question_Writer_Manual/About_Questions/Question_Options|the Adding Options]] section of the About Questions chapter.{{clr}}

You will be able to see an example of an audio quiz online by following this link [http://www.centralquestion.com/accents].

If you have the Professional version of Question Writer, you can adjust the image quality of jpg images using the sliding scale in the [[../../Quiz Options/Appearance Settings/Jpeg Image Quality|Appearance Settings-Jpeg Image Quality]] properties window.   {{clr}}
|}


In both Standard and Professional versions, you can also adjust the Flash Version of the published images in [[../../Quiz Options/Appearance Settings/Publish as Flash Version|Appearance Settings - Publish as Flash Version]].  Flash saved as version 8 will display a better resolution image.

If you own the Professional Version you can customize the appearance of your quiz by adding your own background image and by changing the screen loader image.  This is done as part of the Quiz Properties in [[../../Quiz Options/Appearance Settings/Override Background Images|Override Background Images]].  You add the images in the same way that you add an image to a question ([[../../About Questions|About Questions]]).  You can use any .gif,.jpg or .swf (v8 or earlier).  This means that your quiz can fit seamlessly into your website or corporate brand.

For best results, use images with the same dimensions as the theme you are using. The most common size is 800x600. Higher resolution is generally better - but often a jpeg/bitmap style background won't look so good when it is resized for the browser. Instead - switch off the web setting, 'maximize in browser', or even better, use vector images inside a Flash file for the best results. 

=== What Dimensions To Use ===
To find out the right dimensions for the theme you're using - deselect the web setting 'maximize in the browser', then publish for the web and have a look at the html code in the published file . . . there will be a line similar to, 

&lt;pre&gt;
writeFlash(&quot;v&quot;+rand(10)+&quot;italy.swf&quot;,&quot;800&quot;,&quot;600&quot; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
The 800 and 600 are the exact dimensions that the theme uses. 

Alternatively, you can also look at the .qws or .qwz files directly with notepad to find the values . . . they look like 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;pair name=&quot;flashmoviewidth&quot; value=&quot;800&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;pair name=&quot;flashmovieheight&quot; value=&quot;600&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Question Writer API==

There is a code library to help creating Question Writer quizzes. If you'd like to export to the Question Writer format from your .NET application or website, you can use this [http://www.questionwriter.com/docs/QW_API.dll QW_API.dll] - there's also full documentation on how to use it [http://www.questionwriter.com/docs/CentralQuestion_Documentation_API_word2003.doc]

Question Writer Professional supports importing questions in two formats (click on the item to see more detail about formatting requirements):

*[[../Importing Questions/Moodle XML format|Moodle XML format]]
*[[../Importing Questions/text format|Text Format (.txt and .rtf)]]


If you want to import a file, you simply select '''Import''' from the menu bar and click on either '''Text Format''' or '''Moodle XML'''. A pop up window will appear asking you to select the file that you want to import.{{clr}}
|}



[[Image:Qw3 text import.jpg|center]]



A new quiz window will appear containing the questions that you have imported.  You will have to enter your Quiz Title and Introduction Screen details, and set the quiz up for feedback etc.

The importer doesn't always work perfectly - there can be a lot of variation in the way questions are formatted. If you experience difficultly importing a set of questions - send the file you're importing to '''support@questionwriter.com''' and we will do our best to correct any problems with the import routine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Flash Lite 2==

Flash Lite 2 is a Flash player for mobile phones [http://www.adobe.com/products/flashlite/]. Flash Lite 2 can manage basic Question Writer quizzes as long as the theme is kept simple and the questions are limited in number (about 10 with no feedback or 5 with feedback). This will improve as phones use more memory and better processors.
 
There is some sample Question Writer content for FlashLite 2 [http://www.questionwriter.com/samples/flashlite](double size in browser, click here to download .swf to try on your phone [http://www.questionwriter.com/samples/flashlite/realtor.swf]). 

The sample uses the scenario of an estate agent (or realtor) entering details of a new rental property. It works well as a quick and easy form - it can be used for form filling in a situation where a keyboard isn't practical. It uses the texting mechanism so can be completed with one hand. 
Here's the theme download (.qws) [http://www.questionwriter.com/themes/flminimalism.qws] 

Android 2.2 supports Flash 10 and this is an excellent way to run your quizzes on mobile devices. The quizzes will run on Android 2.2 phones in the same way that they run on desktop browsers. Question Writer includes a theme with a 320x480 resolution that can be used for best effect with mobile phones.

You can read some more about this and see Question Writer running on a phone using an Android app here: [http://www.centralquestion.com/archives/2009/08/flash_quiz_on_the_htc_hero.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==PlayStation Portable==

The Playstation Portable is a mobile gaming device that now supports Flash 6, and so you can run Question Writer tests and quizzes on it. It has a large screen for a mobile device, with widescreen proportions (480x272). You can use the existing themes with the PSP, but it looks best with a theme that is specifically designed for it.

Here's a sample quiz that we've made for the PSP, [http://www.questionwriter.com/samples/pspquiz] (or here, stretched for desktop use [http://www.questionwriter.com/samples/pspquiz/desktop.html]), the source for the quiz [http://www.questionwriter.com/source/tests/gamesknowledge.qwz], and the theme (.qws) [http://www.questionwriter.com/themes/bluenymph.qws]  file too. 

Kudos to Radu Chiotan [http://www1.discreet.com/site/freelance.nsf/0/438eb324080814f285256d11003c4061?OpenDocument]  for creating a great theme and Delia Mihai [http://www.delira.deviantart.com/gallery/] for the cool background.

[[Image:QW3 Play Station.jpg|center]]

When publishing for the PSP - there are a few things to take into account:  
#Turn off the '''[[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings/Browser Options|Maximize in browser]]''' option - this will ensure the quiz appears at the correct size.
#Users can't use the keypad to tab between the buttons. Users must use the pointer device and X button.
#It's a good idea to avoid the use of scrollbar, this will help to preserve memory on the device.
#You'll get between 5 questions with feedback or 20 questions without running out of memory - it depends on all the factors that go into your quiz - more question types, with scrollbars and feedback, and complex buttons and themes all increase pressure on the memory and can lead to an 'out of memory' error on the device.
#Users have to click once on the Flash before starting the quiz to focus/activate it.
#Users can download tests and quizzes to use offline, or live on the internet.
#The PSP runs quite a bit more slowly than desktop flash, users will have to wait a second or two after clicking a button for the effect to show up.
#PSP supports Flash 6, but Flash 6 doesn't allow sending results to our service.  There is a way around this if you send the results back to your own server.  Flash 7 is required to use the 'Results by Email' service.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Simple computations with Mathematica===
 (1-1/7)*(1+2/3)^2
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\frac {50}{21}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
  (25)^(1/2)
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;5\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1307674368000\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

 Sqrt[56.81]

 %^2
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;56.81\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Using variables with Mathematica===
Like any other programming language, Mathematica allows us to assign values to named variables. This often 
makes programs more readable and it allows us to save results for use later in the calculation.
Here, 2.14 is assigned to the variable ''p''. We can then compute &lt;math&gt;p-\ln  \left( p \right) &lt;/math&gt; so that ''p'' is evaluated (replaced by) as 2.14:
 p=2.14
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2.14\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 p - Log[p]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.379194171\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
You can also use more than one variable in a single expression:
 x = 2*a-p
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\,a- 2.14&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 x-Sqrt[a*p]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\,a- 2.14- 1.462873884\,\sqrt {a}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 expr = a*x^2 + b*x + c == 0
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{a{x}} ^{2}+bx+c==0\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Commands to manipulate expressions in Mathematica===
Mathematica has a wide range of commands to help you manipulate expressions:
 f = (a+b)^6
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f:=\left (a+b\right )^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Expand[f]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{a}^{6}+6\,{a}^{5}b+15\,{a}^{4}{b}^{2}+20\,{a}^{3}{b}^{3}+15\,{a}^{2}{b}^{4}+6\,a{b}^{5}+{b}^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Factor[%]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left (a+b\right )^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 %%
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{a}^{6}+6\,{a}^{5}b+15\,{a}^{4}{b}^{2}+20\,{a}^{3}{b}^{3}+15\,{a}^{2}{b}^{4}+6\,a{b}^{5}+{b}^{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Sin[x]^2+Cos[x]^2
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left (\sin(x)\right )^{2}+\left (\cos(x)\right )^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Simplify[%]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Here, the ''%'' symbol recalls the last computation made by Mathematica. ''%%'' means you recalls the computation made two steps back. ''%%%'' will recall the answer to the computation make three steps back.  If you wish to recall answers father back, you will have to have assigned them to a variable. 

You can also substitute values for the variables in an expression with the command ReplaceAll usually entered /.
 x^2+x+1 /.x-&gt;2
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;7\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


The command ''N'' calculates a floating point (numeric) approximation of an expression. You may also specify the desired precision.
 N[Sqrt[3]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.732050808\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 N[Sqrt[3], 50]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.7320508075688772935274463415058723669428052538104\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Defining a function with Mathematica===
You define a function using patterns (_) and SetDelayed ( :=)

 f[t_]:=Sin[t] - t

 f[2*x + 2]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-2 x+\sin (2 x+2)-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Calculus with Mathematica===
Derivatives of expressions can be taken with the D command:
 D[f[t],t]
Multiple partial derivatives can be given as a list.  To take the derivative of g with respect to u then v:
 D[g[u,v,w],u,v]


Mathematica can be used to find a primitive, indefinite integral or anti-derivative of an expression.
 Integrate[1/(1+x^3),x]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\tan ^{-1}\left(\frac{2
   x-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)}{\sqrt{3}}+\frac{1}{3} \log (x+1)-\frac{1}{6}
   \log \left(x^2-x+1\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 
Mathematica can also compute definite integrals:
 Integrate[f[t],{t,0,Pi}]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2-\frac{1}{2}\pi^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

NIntegrate is used for numerical integration:
 NIntegrate[f[t],{t,0,Pi}]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;1.57079633\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Limits, sums and products with Mathematica===
You can also find numeric and symbolic values of sums, limits and products using respectively the functions ''sum'', ''limit'' and ''product'':
 Limit[(2*t-3)/(3*t+4),t-&gt;Infinity]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Limit[(2*t-3)/(3*t+4),t-&gt;-4/3,Direction-&gt;-1] (*right-bound of the limit*)
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Sum[i^2,{i,1,10}]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;385\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Product[1/i,{i,1,10}]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;=\frac{1}{3628800}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Solving equations with Mathematica===
The ''Solve[eqn,x]'' function tries to find the value of ''x'' in ''eqn''. You can also use more variables or more equations using ''Solve[{eqn1,eqn2,...},{x,y,...}]
 Solve[2*t+3==-t+6*Sqrt[2]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left\{\left\{t\to -1+2 \sqrt{2}\right\}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Solve[t-15/4*u==5/2*(u-t)+3,u]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left\{\left\{u\to \frac{2}{25} (7 t-6)\right\}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
 Solve[{a-b==2,a+3*b==7},{a,b}]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left\{\left\{a\to \frac{13}{4},b\to \frac{5}{4}\right\}\right\}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The following Mathematica sequence will find the determinant of the 6&amp;times;6 matrix whose ''i'', ''j''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;th entry contains ''ij''.
 &lt;small&gt;In[1]:=&lt;/small&gt; Det[Array[Times, {6, 6}]]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[1]=&lt;/small&gt; 0

So the determinant of such a matrix is 0 (i.e. it is singular).

The following numerically calculates the root of the equation ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2, starting at the point ''x'' = -1.

 &lt;small&gt;In[2]:=&lt;/small&gt; FindRoot[Exp[x] == x^2 + 2, {x, -1}]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[2]=&lt;/small&gt; {x -&gt; 1.3190736768573652}

Mathematica can do integral and differential calculus, in particular evaluation of integrals in terms of special functions. For example:

 &lt;small&gt;In[3]:=&lt;/small&gt; Integrate[x/Sin[x], x]//OutputForm
 &lt;small&gt;Out[3]=&lt;/small&gt; x (Log[1 - E&lt;sup&gt;I x&lt;/sup&gt;] - Log[1 + E&lt;sup&gt;I x&lt;/sup&gt;]) + I (PolyLog[2, -E&lt;sup&gt;I x&lt;/sup&gt;] - PolyLog[2, E&lt;sup&gt;I x&lt;/sup&gt;])

Here, &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;I&lt;/tt&gt; are the fundamental constants e and i respectively, and &lt;tt&gt;PolyLog[s,z]&lt;/tt&gt; is the polylogarithm function &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Li}_s\left(z\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Symbolic sums can be calculated. For example:

 &lt;small&gt;In[4]:=&lt;/small&gt; Sum[z^k/k^s, {k, 1, Infinity}]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[4]=&lt;/small&gt; PolyLog[s, z]

For[start, test, incr, body] executes start, then repeatedly evaluates body 
and incr until test fails to give True.

''Example:&lt;br&gt;''
&lt;pre&gt;
For[x=1, x&lt;5, x=x+1, Print[&quot;x=&quot;,x]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

===While Loop===
While[test, body] evaluates test, then body, repetitively, until test first fails to give True.

''Example:&lt;br&gt;''
Define a Function f[x]
&lt;pre&gt;
f[x_] := (x^2 -1)/(x+1)
&lt;/pre&gt;
Use the function in a while loop to calculate the sum of those terms.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
i=0; While[i &lt; 0, tot += f[i]; i++].
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that the roles of ; and , are reversed relative to the C programming language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Multiple programming paradigms ===
Mathematica permits multiple approaches to programming. Consider this example: we want a table of values of gcd(''x'', ''y'') for 1 &amp;le; ''x'' &amp;le; 5, 1 &amp;le; ''y'' &amp;le; 5.

The most concise approach is to use one of the many specialized functions:

 &lt;small&gt;In[3]:=&lt;/small&gt; Array[GCD, {5, 5}]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[3]=&lt;/small&gt; {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 2, 1}, {1, 1, 3, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 4, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1, 5}}

There are at least three other approaches to this:
 &lt;small&gt;In[4]:=&lt;/small&gt; Table[GCD[x, y], {x, 1, 5}, {y, 1, 5}]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[4]=&lt;/small&gt; {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 2, 1}, {1, 1, 3, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 4, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1, 5}}

An [[w:APL (programming language) | APL]]-style approach:
 &lt;small&gt;In[5]:=&lt;/small&gt; Outer[GCD, Range[5], Range[5]]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[5]=&lt;/small&gt; {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 2, 1}, {1, 1, 3, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 4, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1, 5}}
&lt;tt&gt;Outer&lt;/tt&gt; corresponds to the generalized outer product operator, &lt;tt&gt;Range&lt;/tt&gt; corresponds to the iota operator. &lt;tt&gt;Outer&lt;/tt&gt; admits general functions, whether they be named, or ''anonymous''. Anonymous functions are specified by using &lt;tt&gt;#''n''&lt;/tt&gt; to as the function argument and appending an &amp;. The above function could be equivalently specified as &lt;tt&gt;Outer[GCD[#1, #2] &amp;, Range[5], Range[5]]&lt;/tt&gt;.

An approach using loops:
 &lt;small&gt;In[6]:=&lt;/small&gt; l1 = {}; (* initialize as empty list, since we want a list in the end *)
 Do[l2 = {};
 Do[l2 = Append[l2, GCD[i, j]], {j, 1, 5}];
 l1 = Append[l1, l2], (* append the sublist, that is, the row *)
 {i, 1, 5}]

 &lt;small&gt;In[7]:=&lt;/small&gt; l1
 &lt;small&gt;Out[7]=&lt;/small&gt; {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 2, 1}, {1, 1, 3, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 4, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1, 5}}
Observe that this solution is considerably larger than the previous ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Common structures and manipulations ===
One guiding principle in Mathematica is a unified structure behind almost all objects representable in Mathematica. For example, the expression &lt;math&gt;x^4+1&lt;/math&gt; if entered will be represented as if it were written:
 &lt;small&gt;In[8]:=&lt;/small&gt; x^4 + 1
 &lt;small&gt;Out[8]=&lt;/small&gt; 1+x&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

If the &lt;tt&gt;FullForm&lt;/tt&gt; command is used on this expression however:
 &lt;small&gt;In[9]:=&lt;/small&gt; FullForm[x^4 + 1]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[9]=&lt;/small&gt; Plus[1, Power[x, 4]]

All objects in Mathematica, except atomic ones such as symbols, numbers, and strings, have the basic form ''head''[''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''...''] (which may be displayed or entered in some other fashion). For example, the head of the above expression is &lt;tt&gt;Plus&lt;/tt&gt;. Lists have this structure too, where the head is &lt;tt&gt;List&lt;/tt&gt;, and the elements are ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. The concept of ''head'' is defined for atomic objects as well (&lt;tt&gt;Symbol&lt;/tt&gt; for symbols, &lt;tt&gt;Integer&lt;/tt&gt; for whole numbers, etc.), but they have no extractable subparts.

This principle permits ordinary expressions unrelated to lists to be operated on with list operators:
 &lt;small&gt;In[10]:=&lt;/small&gt; Expand[(Cos[x] + 2 Log[x^11])/13]&lt;nowiki&gt;[[2, 1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;small&gt;Out[10]=&lt;/small&gt; 2/13
The reverse can also occur -- lists can be modified to behave like ordinary expressions:
 &lt;small&gt;In[11]:=&lt;/small&gt; Map[Apply[Log, #] &amp;, {{2, x}, {3, x}, {4, x}}]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[11]=&lt;/small&gt; {Log[x]/Log[2], Log[x]/Log[3], Log[x]/Log[4]}
where the &lt;tt&gt;Apply&lt;/tt&gt; function changes the head of its second argument to that of the first, and &lt;tt&gt;Map&lt;/tt&gt; behaves like the [[higher-order function|map function]] found in many functional languages. Note that &lt;tt&gt;Log[b,x]&lt;/tt&gt; is the base &lt;tt&gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; logarithm, which is [[Logarithm#Change of base|converted]] to &lt;tt&gt;Log[x]/Log[b]&lt;/tt&gt; on input.

Because of this equivalence between a regular mathematical object represented in Mathematica to that of a simple list structure, some built-in Mathematica functions permit ''threading'', where functions map themselves over lists without much further specification. Indeed, &lt;tt&gt;Apply&lt;/tt&gt; threads itself over lists when invoked as
 &lt;small&gt;In[12]:=&lt;/small&gt; Apply[Log, {{2,x}, {3,x}, {4,x}}, 1]
 &lt;small&gt;Out[12]=&lt;/small&gt; {Log[x]/Log[2], Log[x]/Log[3], Log[x]/Log[4]}
where the third argument being a 1 specifies that &lt;tt&gt;Apply&lt;/tt&gt; replaces the heads of its argument only at the first level in the list, which is what we want, and is equivalent to the above example.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To produce a simple 2D plot of ''f(x)'' versus x use the &quot;Plot&quot; command.  The simple plot structure is written as &quot;&lt;code&gt;Plot[f(x),{x,lower_bound,upper_bound}]&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

''Example:''
 Plot[x^2+4,{x,-5,5}];

Two functions can be plotted together using the form &quot;&lt;code&gt;Plot[{f(x),g(x)},{x,lower_bound,upper_bound}]&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.

 Plot[{x^2 + 4, 10 Sin[x]}, {x, -5, 5}];

{{recipesummary|Cookie recipes|Three dozen|10-11 minutes or until brown.|2}}

== Ingredients ==

* ½ cup non-dairy [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* ½ cup non-dairy [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 1 cup brown sugar
* ½ a banana
* 8-12 oz. vegan chocolate chips
* 2 tsp (5ml) baking powder
* 1 tsp (5ml) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (whole wheat pastry flour recommended but all-purpose white also works)

== Procedure ==

#Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
#Cream shortening, margarine, and sugar together in a mixer.
#Add banana to the sugar and butter mixture.
#Mix all the dry ingredients together. Slowly add to the wet mixture.
#Add chocolate chips.
#Roll small portions into balls and place on a cookie sheet.
#Bake 10-11 minutes, or until slightly browned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Introduction to Modx===
You may have heard of Joomla! or Drupal or any other number of CMS's, but they all have the same, uneditable, uniform feel to them. There is no way to break free of the bonds that tie you down to the system. This is not true with a relatively new addition to the CMS scene, Modx. Modx is powerful and fast, while still being 100% customizable in every way. It does not matter what you want to do in Modx, if it can be done in PHP, it can be done in this powerhouse of a framework.
==What is Modx?==
Modx is several things. It is a customizable web application builder, a website builder, a content management system (CMS) and much more. Basically, it is a powerful tool for creating almost anything you want in an easy to use graphical user interface (GUI).

Thanks for your work on the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]].  Are you related to [[User:Lwan98]]?  If so, tell him I said &quot;Hi!&quot; --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 19:12, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

== [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Currency|Currency]] Honor ==

I had marked the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Currency|Currency]] Honor complete because it does have complete answers - though only for the USA version.  I think we should put it back that way, but I'm open to reasons to not do that.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 21:16, 5 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

=Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation=
Moves: '''1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 Nbd7'''

This knight move is a natural one in the Najdorf, and it also stops Bxf6, doubling the Black pawns. Although not as popular as the move 6...e6, it is a solid, respectable alternative to the main line. Both sides will usually castle queenside. Black, using his knights and light-squared bishop, will attempt to pressure e4. White, on the other hand, will try to get play on the a2-g8 diagonal and the central files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">
==The different sounds of the Manchu language==

The Manchu script consists of 24 Manchu letters to write 25 native Manchu sounds, and 10 letters to write sounds found in Chinese (these 10 letters are  k', g', h', ts', dz', zh', sy' cy', jy' xy' and are dealt with in lesson 12). The 24 native Manchu letters include:

{|
|-
|6 vowels:
| a,e,i,o,u,v
|-
|18 consonants:
|n,k,g,h,b,p,s,x,t,d,l,m,c,j,y,r,f,w
|-
|......................................
|......................................
|-
|}

===Vowels===

Manchu has the 6 short vowels mentioned above, two long vowels, 7 diphthongs and 1 triphthong:
{|
|-
|Short vowels: 
|a,e,i,o,u,v
|-
|Long vowels: 
|ii,oo
|-
|Diphthongs: 
|ai,ei,oi,ui,io,ao,eo,
|-
|Triphthong:
|ioi
|-
|......................................
|......................................
|-
|}

===Consonants===

As for consonants, in addition to the 18 consonants mentioned above Manchu has one combined consonant ‘rs’ and two doubled consonants ‘tt’ and ‘xx’.

Notes:

*	Of the 18 consonants, the two that are not pronounced like in English are ‘x’ which sounds like ‘sh’ and ‘c’ which sounds like ‘ch’.
*	The phoneme ‘ng’ is also found in the Manchu language but is not a separate letter.
*	The Manchu script contains front and back versions of ‘k’, ‘g’, ‘h’, ‘d’, and ‘t’
*       In Manchu transliterations and online the vowel 'v' is also often written as 'ū'
*       In Manchu transliterations and online the consonant 'x' is also often written as 'sh' or 'š'
* No Manchu words start with ‘r’ or two or more consonants. 
* As for endings, Manchu words end in either a vowel or ‘n’. Some loanwords do however end in ‘ng’ e.g. (wang – king). In this respect, it is close to being an open syllable language. 
* There are sometimes clusters of consonants between vowels such as in ‘abka’ (heaven) and ‘ilha’ (flower) but these are the final and initial consonants of two separate syllables. In most words however, vowels are separated by single consonants.

==Syllable structure in Manchu==

The Manchu language has the following syllable structures:

{|
|-
|'''Manchu Syllable Structure'''    
|'''Example'''
|-
|V
|‘a-’ in a-ma (father)
|-
|VV
|‘ai’ what
|-
|VC 
|‘am-‘ in am-ban (official)
|-
|VCC
|‘axx-‘ in axxasun (verb)
|-
|CV
|‘du-’ in du-ka (gate)
|-
|CVV
|‘moo’ (wood)
|-
|CVVC
|‘duin’ (four)
|-
|CVC
|‘den’ (high)
|-
|CVCC
|‘faxx-‘ in faxx-an (effort)
|-
|CVVV
|‘elioi’ (吕 - a Chinese surname)
|-
|}

Out of the above syllable structures, CVVV is extremely rare as it can only occur with the triphthong ‘ioi’; and both VCC and CVCC are also quite rare as they can only occur with one of the two doubled consonants ‘tt’ or ‘xx’ or with the combined consonants ‘rs’.

==Vowel harmony==

The Manchu language is subject to the rules of vowel harmony. This means that only certain vowels can appear together in the same word and that the vowel in the first syllable of a word must be of the same type as the vowel in the second syllable. Note: vowel harmony in Manchu isn’t as strict as in Turkic or Mongolic languages. Manchu vowels fall into the following three categories:

* Front vowels (阴性)		e
* Back vowels (阳性)		a,o,v
* Neutral vowels (中性)		u,i

In theory, front and back vowels can not exist in the same word, although there are some examples of this (ajige - small). However, neutral vowels can exist with both front and back vowels. There are two forms of vowel harmony:


===Vowel harmony within a stem===
This form of vowel harmony involves the vowels within a particular stem (a word with no suffixes) harmonising. In general one word will only have the following combinations of vowels (the first vowel is the vowel in the first syllable):
{|
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|‘a’ and one of 
|‘a’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘v’ 
|-
|‘e’ and one of
|‘e’, ‘i’, ‘u’
|-
|‘i’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘v’
|-
|‘o’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘v’
|-
|‘u’ and one of
|‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘u’, ‘v’
|-
|‘v’ and one of 
|‘a’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’, ‘v’  
|-
|}

Note: the vowel ‘o’ vary rarely exists in a word with other vowels, and if it does it is nearly always with ‘a’,’v’,’i’ or occasionally ‘e’, but basically never with ‘u’.
The vowels ‘u’ and ‘i’ can go with all other vowels


===Stem-suffix vowel harmony===

Stem-suffix vowel harmony involves the vowels of a stem harmonising with the vowels of whatever suffix is attached to that stem. The rules are a bit different for stems with single, double or multiple syllables:


'''Single Syllable Stems'''
{|
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|'''Stem'''    
|'''Suffix'''
|-
|a    
|a
|-
|-
|o    
|o
|-
|e    
|e
|-
|i,u    
|Usually 'e'
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|}


'''Double Syllable Stems'''
{|
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................    
|-
|'''Stem'''    
|'''Suffix'''
|-
|a-a, a-v, a-u, o-i, v-i, a-i, u-i, i-i
|a
|-
|o-o, a-o
|o
|-
|e-e, o-e, e-u, e-i, i-u, u-u
|e
|-
|...................................................    
|...................................................   
|-
|}

* Note: there are exceptions to the above rules for double syllable stems, but in most cases the above rules hold.


'''Multiple Syllable Stems'''

* In general, stems terminating in 'a', 'e' or 'o' take the corresponding vowel in the suffix. 
* Stems with multiple syllables terminating in 'i' or 'u' and proceded by 'e' generally take 'e' in the suffix.
* Stems with multiple syllables terminating in 'i' or 'u' and proceded by 'a', 'u' or 'v' generally take 'a' in the suffix.
* Stems with multiple syllables with 'u' and 'v' generally take 'a' in the suffix.


Notes: 
* Some suffixes such as ‘de’ ‘-bu’ etc are fixed and do not change.
* Some words use the vowels ‘a’ and ‘e’ to distinguish between masculine and feminine concepts, e.g. haha (man), hehe (woman).
* There are two forms of the letters ‘k’, ‘g’, and ‘h’, a back form for the vowels ‘a’,’o’,’v’, and a front form for the vowels ‘e’,’u’,’i’. 
* There are also two forms of the letters ‘d’, and ‘t’, a back form for the letters ‘a’, ‘o’, ‘i’, and a front form for the letters ‘e’ and ‘u’.


== Nouns==

Manchu nouns have number and case but do not really have gender. Nouns can consist solely of a stem such as 'bithe' (book), be formed by adding suffixes to other words, or be formed by adding two nouns together such as 'ahvn deo' (brothers).


The most common suffixes that can be added to words to form nouns include:

{|
|-
|............................................................
|............................................................
|-
|'''Suffixes used with verb stems	'''
|'''Examples'''
|-
| -n	
|taci'''n''' – Learning. From the verb stem '''taci'''mbi (to study)
|-
| -gan, -gen, -gon, -han, -hen, -hon	
|niru'''gan''' – Drawing. From the verb stem '''niru'''mbi (to draw)
|-
| -ku, -kv	
|ana'''kv''' - Key. From the verb stem '''ana'''mbi (to push)
|-
| -cun	
|buye'''cun''' - Love. From the verb stem '''buye'''mbi (to love)
|-
|'''Suffixes used with nouns and verbs'''
|'''Examples'''
|-
| -si	
|usi'''si''' – Farmer. From the noun usin (field)
|-
| -ci	
|adu'''ci'''  - Herdsman. From the noun adun (herd)
|-
| -ji, -lji, -mji, -nju	
|boigo'''ji''' – Host. From the noun boigon (family)
|-
|............................................................
|............................................................
|-
|}


Note: of the above suffixes, the suffixes –ku,-kv are used for instruments, the suffix –cun is used for abstract concepts, and the suffixes –si, -ci, and –ji are used to denote people by what they do (Gorelova, M. P.198). When adding suffixes to nouns, the final ‘-n’ is often dropped.


====Gender of Manchu Nouns====

Nouns usually do not have gender, although some obviously masculine nouns have masculine vowels, while feminine nouns have feminine vowels, e.g. haha (man), hehe (woman), ama (father) and eme (mother).


====Number:====

There are several ways to express the plural in Manchu:

&lt;u&gt;Through the use of the suffix -sa (-se, -so, -si)&lt;/u&gt;
* E.g. manju'''sa''' - Manchu'''s'''
&lt;u&gt;Through use of one of the suffixes -ta, -te, -ri.&lt;/u&gt;
* This is mostly used for family relationships (note final 'n' is often omitted).
* E.g. ama'''ta''' - father'''s'''
* The suffix '-ri' is only used with a few words. E.g. mafa'''ri''' - grandfathers/ancestors
&lt;u&gt;Through the use of adjectives&lt;/u&gt;
* like geren (many/all), eiten (all), tumen (a myriad) or verbally with gemu (all)
* E.g. tumen jaka - The myriad things (万物)


====Case====

Manchu has 5 different cases. Cases can be attached to the proceeding noun or written seperately:

&lt;u&gt;Nominative (no suffix).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This is the natural case and has no suffix. 
* E.g. bithe - book

&lt;u&gt;Genitive (-i, -ni after -ng).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to show the possessive. The suffix -i (-ni) can also be used for instrumental case which shows the means or cause of which something happens. 
* E.g. ere oci mini eme '''i''' bithe - This is my mother''''s''' book (''Possessive'')
* E.g. mafa gurun '''i''' ilha - The fatherland''''s''' flowers (''Possessive'')
* E.g. manju gisun '''i''' arambi - To write '''by means of''' Manchu (''Insturmental'')

&lt;u&gt;Dative/Locative (-de).&lt;/u&gt;
*This case is used to show location or direction (at/to).
* E.g. Direction:  Harbin '''de''' genehe - He went '''to''' Harbin (''Dative'')
* E.g. Location:  Harbin '''de''' manjusa labdu - There are many Manchus '''in''' Harbin (''Locative'')
* E.g. Beijing '''de''' niyengniyeri isinaha - '''In''' Beijing spring has arrived

&lt;u&gt;Accusative (-be).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to make a noun the direct object of an action.
* E.g. i ere bithe '''be''' mini eme de buha - He gave '''this''' book to my mother 
* E.g. te mini eme inenggidari manju gisun '''be''' tacimbi - Now my mother studies '''Manchu''' everyday.
* E.g. be mafa gurun '''be''' hairambi - We love the '''fatherland''' 

&lt;u&gt;Ablative (-ci).&lt;/u&gt; 
* This case is used to show point of departure or for comparison.
* E.g. monggo gurun '''ci''' jihe niyalma - The people who came '''from''' Mongolia (''Point of departure'')
* E.g. nikan gisun '''ci''' manju gisun ja - Manchu is easier '''than''' Chinese (''Comparison'')
* E.g. emu inenggi '''ci''' emu inenggi halukan oho - Each day is hotter '''than''' the one before (''Comparison'')


==Pronouns==


===Personal pronouns===

As with nouns, personal pronouns in Manchu also have different cases. The normal form of Manchu personal pronouns is expressed by using the nominative case. See following table for list of all personal pronouns in the 5 different cases:

* The personal pronoun in the nominative case is the ordinary form of the pronoun, e.g. bi = I, si = you, i = he/she/it, be = we (excl.), muse = we (incl.), suwe = you (plural), ce = they/them
* For the singular first personal pronoun &quot;I&quot; the different forms are: nominative '''bi''' &quot;I&quot;; genitive '''mini''' &quot;my&quot;; dative/locative '''minde''' &quot;to/at me&quot;; accusative '''mimbe''' &quot;me&quot;; ablative '''minci''' &quot;from me&quot;. All the other personal pronouns follow the same pattern. 
* As with Chinese, Manchu has two versions of the 1st plural personal pronoun: an exclusive version ‘be’, and an inclusive version ‘muse’.
* To express the idea of oneself, you would use the genitive form of the personal pronoun and follow it with the word ‘beye’ (body). E.g. mini beye (myself), sini beye (yourself).
* The possessive pronoun is formed by adding the suffix ‘-ngge’ after the genitive form of the personal pronoun. E.g. mini-ngge (mine). Ere bithe miningge (this book is mine). 
* The suffix '-ngge' is a possessive suffix which does not change with the rules of vowel harmony. When written it is proceeded by the genetive case and therefore becomes one of '-ingge' or '-ningge'. In the case of use with personal pronouns, it is already proceeded by the genitive form of the pronoun so remains '-ngge'. It can be translated as belong to, and is often written separately from the noun. E.g. ejen ningge - belonging to the master. 

Now for some examples of the different cases:

'''Nominative'''
* '''bi''' manju gisun be tacimbi - '''I''' study the Manchu language 
* '''i''' oci manju niyalma - '''He''' is Manchu

'''Genitive'''
* '''mini''' gucu oci manju niyalma - '''My''' friend is Manchu
* '''meni''' eme oci mafa gurun - '''Our''' mother is the fatherland

'''Dative/Locative'''
* '''sinde''' ai baita bi? - What issue do '''you (at)''' have?
* tere emu debtelin (mw for book) bithe be '''minde''' buki (to give imp) - Can you please give '''(to) me''' this book

'''Accusative'''
* mafa gurun '''membe''' ujime hvwaxabuha - The fatherland raised '''us (object)'''
* bi '''cembe''' emu biya onggolo takaha - I met '''him (object)''' one month ago 

'''Ablative'''
* i '''minci''' juwe se ajige - He is two years younger '''than me'''
* si '''minci''' tulgiyen we takambi? - Apart '''from me''' who do you know?

Note: the number for 15 is irregular


===Manchu ordinal numerals===

Ordinal numbers in Manchu are formed by adding ‘-ci’ to the end of the cardinal form of the number. In the case of numbers that end in an ‘n’, the final n is dropped (except for in the case of juwan and tumen). E.g:
* emuci	(First)
* juwe tanggv susai emuci (251st)
* ningguci	(Sixth)
* minggaci 	(One thousandth) 
* juwanci	(Tenth)
* tumenci	(Ten thousandth)
* juwan duici (Fourteenth)


===Manchu distributive numerals===

Distributive numerals can be formed by adding the suffix ‘-ta’, ‘-te’ or ‘-to’ depending on the rules of vowel harmony. E.g.:
* ilata (one of three)
* tofohoto (one of 15)
* emte (one each).


===Manchu multiplicative numerals===

As for multiplicative numerals, one can either use the word ‘ubu’ (times), or use one of the postpositions such as ‘mudan’ (time), ‘jergi’ (time). E.g.:
* juwe ubu (twice)
* juwe mudan (twice)
* juwe jergi (twice) 


===Manchu fractions===

Fractional numerals can be formed by either using the genitive or ablative case, or by using the dative/locative case in combination with the word ‘ubu’ (times). E.g
* sunja i emu (1/5)
* sunja ci emu (1/5)
* sunja ubu de emu ubu (1/5).

== Adjectives==


Adjectives can be divided into:
* Original Adjectives(性质形容词) 
* Adjectives formed from other words (派生形容词)


====Original adjectives====

Original adjectives are adjectives that are not formed from other types of words. Original adjectives can be divided into:

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives describing special features of a person or an object.&lt;/u&gt;

For example:
* amba (big)
* ajige (small)
* golmin (long)

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives describing the character (nature) of a person or object.&lt;/u&gt;

For example:
* sain (good)
* ice (new)
* fe (old)

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives describing the action or change of state of a person or object.&lt;/u&gt;

For example:
* hanci (near)
* labdu (many)
* goro (far away)


====Adjectives formed from other words====

These are adjectives that are formed by adding suffixes (subject to the rules of vowel harmony) to nouns, verbs, or original adjectives.
Adjectives formed from other words can be divided into:

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives formed from nouns&lt;/u&gt; 

These adjectives are formed by adding the suffix '''‘-ngge’, ‘-ngga’''', or '''‘-nggo’''' to the end of a noun. This suffix is similar in many ways to Chinese 的 (except it is not a true possessive suffix). For example, enduri (spirit/神) --&gt; enduri-'''ngge''' (holy/神圣的) and can basically be translated as &quot;to possess the quality of....&quot;. 

The suffix '-ngge' but not '-ngga' or '-nggo' later became a proper possessive suffix (like Chinese 的). When written it is proceeded by the genetive case and therefore becomes one of '-ingge' or '-ningge'. In the case of use with personal pronouns, it is already proceeded by the genitive form of the pronoun so remains '-ngge'. It can be translated as 'belongging to', and is often written separately from the noun. E.g. ejen ningge - belonging to the master. 

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives formed from verbs&lt;/u&gt;

These can be divided into three types:
* Adjectives that can be formed from verbs by adding the suffix '''‘-cuka’, ‘-cuke’'''.
* Adjectives that can be formed from verbs by adding the suffix (these are also occasionally used to form adjectives from nouns) '''‘-shvn’, ‘-shun’ ‘-hvn’, ‘-hun’'''.
* Adjectives that can be formed from verbs by adding the suffix '''‘-su’, ‘-be’, ‘-ba’'''.

&lt;u&gt;Adjectives formed from original adjectives&lt;/u&gt;

These adjectives are formed by adding the suffix '''‘-linggv’, ‘-linggu’''' to the end of original adjectives. Note: adjectives that end in an ‘n’ drop the ‘n’ when adding the suffix ‘-linggu’, or ‘-linggv’. The suffix ‘-linggu’ can be translated as ‘very’. E.g. if you add ‘-lingu’ to the adjective amba (big) you get ambalinggu (huge).


These suffixes are summarised in this table:

====Forms of Manchu adjectives====

Manchu adjectives have three different forms (级):

&lt;u&gt;The normal form (原级)&lt;/u&gt;

This is the normal form of the adjective and does not include any suffixes. E.g:
* den alin (high mountain)
* ice bithe (new book)

&lt;u&gt;The comparative form (比较级)&lt;/u&gt;

This form only applies to original adjectives, and involves a comparison, i.e. bigger, smaller etc. To form the comparative form a suffix is added to the end of the adjective to change its meaning. The main suffixes are:
*	-kan (-ken, -kon, -gan, -gen, -cen)
*	-liyan (-liyen), -meliyan
*	-shun, -shvn
*	-si
*	-linggv (-linggu) (see 5.2)

With these suffixes the final ‘n’ of the adjective stem is dropped when the suffix is added. E.g. ‘den’ (high) + -ken becomes ‘deken’ (higher, comparatively high). Examples of the use of these suffixes include:
		
{|
|-
|........................................................
|........................................................

|-
|'''Suffix'''
|'''Meaning'''
|'''Example'''
|-
| -kan, (-ken, -kon, -gan, -gen, -cen)
|Rather, somewhat
|ambakan (somewhat bigger)
|-
| -liyan (-liyen), -meliyan
|A bit, somewhat
|adaliliyan (a bit similar)
|-
| -linggv (-linggu)	
|Very
|ambalinggv (huge, very big)
|-
| -shvn (-shun)	
|Rather	
|aibishvn (rather swollen)
|-
| -si
|Rather
|ajigesi (rather small)
|-
|........................................................
|........................................................
|........................................................
|-
|}

The comparative can also be formed by placing the word ‘majige’ (a bit) before the adjective. E.g majige amba (a bit big). When creating comparative constructions, the ablative case marker is used: 

* E.g. nikan gisun '''ci''' manju gisun ja - Manchu is easier than Chinese
* E.g. emu inenggi '''ci''' emu inenggi halukan oho - Each day is hotter than the one before 



&lt;u&gt;The superlative form (最高级)&lt;/u&gt;

The superlative form of the Manchu can be formed by placing an adverb before the adjective. For example:
* ‘jaci’ - jaci amba – very big
* ‘umesi’ – umesi sain – very good

It can also be formed by using the comparative construction, or by use of the genetive case. For example:
* geren ci amba - bigger than all (the biggest)
* ujui uju oyonggo baita - the first of the first important thing (the most important thing)


== Verbs==

====Introduction====

Manchu verbs (except for three non-changing verbs) all consist of a stem and a final. The dictionary form of a Manchu verb is the present tense form, which includes the verb stem and the suffix ‘-mbi’.  E.g.: Arambi (to write) consists of ara + -mbi. All changes for mood or tense in Manchu verbs are done by removing the suffix ‘-mbi’ and by adding another suffix to indicate the tense or mood of the verb (more on this later).

Manchu verbs can be divided into:
* &lt;u&gt;Original verbs (固有动词)&lt;/u&gt; – These are verbs that are not derived from nouns, adjectives or other verbs and include verbs such as ‘arambi’ (to write) etc.
* &lt;u&gt;Verbs derived from other words (派生动词)&lt;/u&gt; – These are verbs that are derived from either nouns, adjectives or other verbs (see voice of Manchu verbs).

Verbs derived from nouns and adjectives are usually formed by adding one of the following suffixes (see table for list of common suffixes) to the end of a noun or an adjective (note the final ‘n’ of the noun or adjective being turned into a verb is usually dropped):

{|
|-
|.........................................

|'''Verb formed by adding suffix'''
|-
|‘-ta’ (te, to)
|dasan (politics, management)
|dasatambi (to put in order) 
|-
|‘-da’ (de, do)
|jali (crafy)
|jalidambi (to cheat)
|-
|‘-na’ (ne, no)	
|acan (a union)
|acanambi (to meet)
|-
|‘-la’ (le)
|aba (a hunt)	
|abalambi (to hunt)
|-
|‘-ra’ (re, ro)	
|gisun (language)
|gisurembi (to speak)
|-
|‘-xa’ (xe, xo)	
|adali (similar)
|adalixambi (to be similar)
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

====Regular, irregular and non-changing verbs====

Verbs can also be divided into three categories depending on the change in the verb suffix:

&lt;u&gt;Regular verbs&lt;/u&gt; – These are verbs that follow regular suffix change patterns.

&lt;u&gt;Irregular verbs&lt;/u&gt; – These are verbs that don’t follow regular suffix change patterns (see irregular verb table 8.3 for full list).

&lt;u&gt;Non-changing verbs&lt;/u&gt; – These are three verbs that only have one fixed form. These verbs consist of only a verb stem, although grammatically, they feature all the same properties as regular and irregular verbs. The three non-changing verbs are:
* ‘bi’ – To have (有). 
* ‘akv’ – To not have (没有).
* ‘joo’ – To forget about it, not worry about it (算了)



====Tense (时) in Manchu verbs====

Unlike say French, the conjugation of Manchu verbs is constant regardless of the person doing the action. I.e. the conjugation for you went and I went would both be 'gene'''he''''. This means only one suffix has to be learnt for each of the tenses. It is convenient to split Manchu tenses into simple tenses (of which there are three) and complex tenses all of which are formed from the simple tenses with the addition of either converbs (such as -me or -fi) or auxiliary verbs (such as bi).

====Voice (态) in Manchu verbs====

Manchu verbs have seven different voices (态). The first voice is the subjective voice, which is the normal verb form. All other voices are formed by adding a suffix between the stem of the verb and the final ‘-mbi’. This forms a new verb. For example: taci-mbi (to study), taci-bu-mbi (to teach). Tacibumbi is the active form of the verb tacimbi and therefore has a completely different meaning. Note: suffixes for tense and mood can be added to the end of the new form of the verb as the suffixes for voice are part of the verb stem. E.g. tacibuha  (I taught), tacibura (I will teach) etc.

The seven voices (note the two directional voices count as one voice) are:

&lt;u&gt;1) 主动 Subjective&lt;/u&gt;

This is the normal voice of the verb and does not take any suffix. E.g. 
* tacimbi - To study

&lt;u&gt;2) 使动 Active (-bu-, -(m)bu-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice shows that you are doing the action to something or someone. You would usually use the case marker ‘be’ to show what you are doing the action to. E.g.
* bi simbe manju gisun taci'''bu'''ha - I taught you Manchu
* bi imbe gene'''bu'''he - I let him go

&lt;u&gt;3) 被动 Passive	(-bu-, -(m)bu-)	&lt;/u&gt;

This voice shows that the action is being done to you. You would usually use the case marker ‘de’ to indicate the direction of the action. E.g. 
* bi tere de tanta'''bu'''ha - I was bashed up by him

&lt;u&gt;4) 方向去 Dir (to)	(-na-, -ne-, -no-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice shows the direction of an action and is similar to English ‘to go’. E.g.
* bithe hvla'''na'''mbi - To go and read
* si bithe uda'''na'''ci - If you go and buy books

&lt;u&gt;5) 方向来 Dir (fr)	(-ji-, -(n)ji-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice shows the direction of an action and is similar to English ‘to come’.E.g.
* bithe hvla'''ji'''mbi - To come and read
* Xiao Wang ya erinde isin'''ji'''mbi? - When does xiao Wang arrive?

&lt;u&gt;6) 齐动 Cooperative	(-ca-, -ce-, -co-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice indicates that an action is being done by a group. It is similar to the English word ‘together’. E.g.
* tese tacikv de efi'''ce'''mbi - They are playing together at school 
* eten i forgon de urgule'''ce'''he - Together we celebrate in victory

&lt;u&gt;7) 互动 Reciprocal	(-nu-, -ndu-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice is used to indicate reciprocal action. It is similar to the English word ‘each other’. E.g.
* nadan gurun ada'''ndu'''me nakarakv - The seven kingdoms fought each other without end
* niyalmasa ishunde aisila'''ndu'''mbi - The people help eachother out

&lt;u&gt;8) 连续 Continuous	 (-da-,-de-;-ta-,-te-;-xa-,-xe-,-xo-; -ca-,-ce-,-co-; -ja-,-je-, -jo-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice is used to indicate the continuous nature of an action and is like English ‘always’, or ‘often’
* bi simbe aisila'''ta'''mbi - I often/always help you

====Forms (式) of the Manchu verb====

The Manchu verb has 6 basic forms:


&lt;u&gt;1) Affirmative &lt;/u&gt;

This is the normal form of the verb. E.g.
* bi te manju gisun be tacime ilihabi - I am currently studying Manchu
* boode mini ama bi - My father is at home
* bi abalara de indahvn gamambi - I take dogs when I go hunting


&lt;u&gt;2) Negative&lt;/u&gt;

This form is the negative form of the verb. Manchu unlike English forms the negative form of a verb by adding suffixes to the verb stem. The two negative forms of Manchu verbs are:

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Present negative 
| -rakv
|ara'''rakv'''
|Don’t write
|-
|Past negative
| -hakv  (-hekv, -hokv)
|ara'''hakv''' 
|Didn’t write
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the negative form are:
* bi harbin de gene'''hekv''' - I did not go to Harbin
* bi manju gisun be gisure'''rakv''' - I don't speak Manchu


&lt;u&gt;3) Interrogative&lt;/u&gt;

This is the question form of the verb. The interrogative form has both a positive and a negative form. The negative form is then further divided into a present and past negative interrogative form. The negative interrogative from is basically formed by adding -n to the end of the negative form of the verb (see table):

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Interrogative
| -o
|arara'''o'''?
|Are you writing?
|-
|Negative Interrogative (present)
| -rakvn
|ara'''rakvn'''? 
|Are you not writing?
|-
|Negative Interrogative (past)
| -hakvn(-hekvn, -hokvn)
|ara'''hakvn'''? 
|Did you not write?
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the interrogative form are:
* si abalara de indahvn gamambi'''o'''? - Do you take dogs when you go hunting?
* si xiao wang be tuwa'''rakvn'''? - Do you not see Xiao Wang?
* si harbin de gene'''hekvn'''? - Haven't you been to Harbin?


&lt;u&gt;4) Imperative&lt;/u&gt;

The imperative form is the form of the verb that is used when you want to tell somebody to do (or not do) something. In Manchu there is a polite imperative form, a negative imperative form and a normal imperative form (see table):

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Imperative
|
|ara 
|Write!
|-
|Imperative (negative)
|ume ……. -ra (-re, -ro) 
|ume ara'''ra'''
|Don’t write
|-
|Imperative (pol 1)
| -rao   (-reo, -roo)
|ara'''rao''' 
|Write please
|-
|Imperative (pol 1)
| -ki
|bu'''ki'''
|Please give
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the imperative form are:
* tuwa (look!)
* inde '''ume''' tuwa'''ra''' - Don't look at him
* si gala be obu'''roo''' - Wash your hands please
* minde tere bithe be bu'''ki''' - Can you please give me that book


&lt;u&gt;5) Optative&lt;/u&gt;

The optative form is where you want another person to do something. There are three different optative forms in Manchu (see table):

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Optative 1 
| -kini 
|ara'''kini''' 
|May he write
|-
|Optative 2
| -cina 
|ara'''cina''' 
|I hope you will write
|-
|Optative 3
| -kini sembi
|mara'''kini sembi'''
|I want you to return
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the optative form are:
* si ere buda be jacina - I hope you will eat this food
* bi simbe harbin hoton de genekini sembi - I want you to go to Harbin


&lt;u&gt;6) Desiderative&lt;/u&gt;

The desiderative form is where you want to do something. It corresponds to English I want to, or I will. Note the -ki form of the desiderative can also be used as a polite imperative. There are two different desiderative forms in Manchu (see table):

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Desiderative 1
| -ki
|ara'''ki'''
|I will write
|-
|Desiderative 2
| -ki sembi
|taci'''ki sembi'''
|I want to study
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the desiderative form are:
* bi sinde majige okto bu'''ki''' - I will give you some medicine
* bi amga'''ki sembi''' - I want to sleep


====Converbs (副动词)====

The main converbs in Manchu are:


&lt;u&gt;1) Coordinative	-me	&lt;/u&gt;

This converb modifies the following verb and can be used to link several verbs. It also expresses simultaneous action, or can be used to start a quote. E.g.
* ai baita be ara'''me''' genembi? (what are you going to do)	
* yacin gvlmahvn sakda niman i boode efi'''me''' genehe (the black rabbit went to the old mountain goat's house to play.)
* suwe ai erinde guri'''me''' jihengge? (when did you move here?)
* ajige xanyan gvlmahvn jabu'''me''':... (the small white rabbit said:....)


&lt;u&gt;2) Subordinative	-fi	&lt;/u&gt;

Refers to a sequence of actions where one action is completed before another one begins. It is like English 'then', and also a bit like 'because' E.g.
* bi gene'''fi''' tuwaki (I will go and (then) have a look)	
* ajige yacin gvlmahvn lafu sogi be gai'''fi''', hendume:&quot;yeyede baniha!&quot;  (the small black rabbit took the bok choi and then said: thank you grandfather)
* yacin gvlmahvn ningge jetere jaka akv o'''fi''', geli sakda niman i boode sogi baime genehe (As the small black rabit had nothing to eat, he then went to the old mountain goat's house to ask for more vegetables)


&lt;u&gt;3) Conditional	-ci&lt;/u&gt;

This is the conditional converb and is similar to English 'if'. E.g.
* bi tuwa'''ci''' (if I look)	
* jalan de suwe akv'''ci''' ergen de jurgan akv ni (If this world did not have you all, then life would have no meaning)
* si Harbin de gene'''ci''' (if you go to Harbin)


&lt;u&gt;4) Durative	-hai (-hei, -hoi)&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is used to express that an action occurs or continues at the same time as another action is performed. E.g.
* necimbi'''hei''' yabumbi (to continuously invade)	


&lt;u&gt;5) Terminative	-tala (-tele, -tolo)	&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is used to show that an action occurs up to a certain time.
* ara'''tala''' (until he writes)
* te'''tele''' (till now)	 


&lt;u&gt;6) Instrumental	-tai (-tei, -toi)&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is used to show that an action is being forced
* buce'''tei''' daharakv (I will not submit even if I die)	


&lt;u&gt;7) Preparative	-nggala (-nggele, -nggolo)&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is like English ‘before’
* utala inenggi o'''nggolo''' (several days ago)


&lt;u&gt;8) Concessive	-cibe	&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is like Enlgish ‘although’
* tuttu bi'''cibe''' (although it is like that)


&lt;u&gt;9) Alternative	-ralame (-relame, -rolame)&lt;/u&gt;	

This converb is used to show that two actions are being performed at the same time
* bi yabu'''ralame''' tuwambi (looking as I’m going along)


&lt;u&gt;10) Simultaneous	-mbime&lt;/u&gt;	

This converb is used to show that one action is occurring (or not) while another action takes place
* si baita be sambi se'''mbime''', ainu takarakv (while you say you know about the matter, how come you don’t?)

====auxiliary verbs (助动词)====

Three important auxiliary verbs in Manchu are:
* sembi – sembi means ‘to say’
* ombi – ‘ombi’ can be translated as ‘to become’, ‘to be’, ‘to act as’,  
* bimbi – ‘bimbi’ can be translated as ‘to be or ‘is’.



====Irregular verbs (table)====

This table is a list of all the irregular Manchu verbs and their irregular forms. Note a blank space indicates that this form of the verb is regular. Note verbs where the suffix ‘-fi’ becomes ‘-pi’ or ‘-mpi’ are not included.

==Adverbs==

Adverbs are words that modify other words except for nouns. Adverbs usually express the time, place or degree of an action and typically answer questions such as how?, when? why? or where? Manchu adverbs can be primitive adverbs which are indeclinable words such as ‘inu’ (yes) or they can be formed by adding suffixes (usually case markers) to the end of nouns, or pronouns. Most numerals can also be used as adverbs.


Some common Manchu adverbs include:

===Verbs (Part 1)===


====Introduction====

Manchu verbs (except for three non-changing verbs) all consist of a stem and a final. The dictionary form of a Manchu verb is the present tense form, which includes the verb stem and the suffix ‘-mbi’.  E.g.: Arambi (to write) consists of ara + -mbi. All changes for mood or tense in Manchu verbs are done by removing the suffix ‘-mbi’ and by adding another suffix to indicate the tense or mood of the verb (more on this later).

Manchu verbs can be divided into:
* &lt;u&gt;Original verbs (固有动词)&lt;/u&gt; – These are verbs that are not derived from nouns, adjectives or other verbs and include verbs such as ‘arambi’ (to write) etc.
* &lt;u&gt;Verbs derived from other words (派生动词)&lt;/u&gt; – These are verbs that are derived from either nouns, adjectives or other verbs (see voice of Manchu verbs).

Verbs derived from nouns and adjectives are usually formed by adding one of the following suffixes (see table for list of common suffixes) to the end of a noun or an adjective (note the final ‘n’ of the noun or adjective being turned into a verb is usually dropped):

|-
|‘-xa’ (xe, xo)	
|adali (similar)
|adalixambi (to be similar)

====Regular, irregular and non-changing verbs====

Verbs can also be divided into three categories depending on the change in the verb suffix:

&lt;u&gt;Regular verbs&lt;/u&gt; – These are verbs that follow regular suffix change patterns.

&lt;u&gt;Irregular verbs&lt;/u&gt; – These are verbs that don’t follow regular suffix change patterns (see irregular verb table 8.3 for full list).

&lt;u&gt;Non-changing verbs&lt;/u&gt; – These are three verbs that only have one fixed form. These verbs consist of only a verb stem, although grammatically, they feature all the same properties as regular and irregular verbs. The three non-changing verbs are:
* ‘bi’ – To have (有). 
* ‘akv’ – To not have (没有).
* ‘joo’ – To forget about it, not worry about it (算了)



====Tense (时) in Manchu verbs====

Unlike say French, the conjugation of Manchu verbs is constant regardless of the person doing the action. I.e. the conjugation for you went and I went would both be 'gene'''he''''. This means only one suffix has to be learnt for each of the tenses. It is convenient to split Manchu tenses into simple tenses (of which there are three) and complex tenses all of which are formed from the simple tenses with the addition of either converbs (such as -me or -fi) or auxiliary verbs (such as bi). See table:

'''The small white rabbit and the small black rabbit'''

A small white rabbit and a small black rabbit went to an old mountain goat's house to play. The old mountain goat gave some of the bok choi he had grown to them. The small black rabbit took the bok choi and said: &quot;thank you grandfather&quot;. The small white rabit did not take the bok choi and pleaded (to the old mountain goat):&quot;please grandfather, can you give me some bok choi seeds!&quot;. The old mountain goat gave him some seeds. After the little white rabbit returned home, he ploughed the soil in the garden and planted the seeds. After several days had passed the seeds sprouted small bok choi stalks. The small white rabbit dilligently watered the plants, fertilised the plants, removed any weeds and killed any insects. The bok choi grew quickly as if it had been pulled up. 


The small black rabbit took the bok choi the old mountain goat gave him home. Each day he did not work, and when he was hungry he would take some of the bok choi the old mountain goat had given him and eat it. The bok choi became less and less each day, and after a few days it was all eaten. As the small black rabit had nothing to eat, he then went to the old mountain goat's house to ask for more vegetables. On the road there he (the small black rabbit) saw the small white rabbit walking towards the old mountain goat's house carrying a carrying pole of bok choi. The small black rabbit thought this was very strange and asked: &quot;small white rabbit, where did you get these vegetables from?&quot; The small white rabbit answered: &quot;I grew them myself, only if you grow vegetables yourself will you have more than enough vegetables&quot;.

===Verbs (part 2)===



====Voice (态) in Manchu verbs====

Manchu verbs have seven different voices (态). The first voice is the subjective voice, which is the normal verb form. All other voices are formed by adding a suffix between the stem of the verb and the final ‘-mbi’. This forms a new verb. For example: taci-mbi (to study), taci-bu-mbi (to teach). Tacibumbi is the active form of the verb tacimbi and therefore has a completely different meaning. Note: suffixes for tense and mood can be added to the end of the new form of the verb as the suffixes for voice are part of the verb stem. E.g. tacibuha  (I taught), tacibura (I will teach) etc.

The seven voices (note the two directional voices count as one voice) are:

&lt;u&gt;1) 主动 Subjective&lt;/u&gt;

This is the normal voice of the verb and does not take any suffix. E.g. 
* tacimbi - To study

&lt;u&gt;2) 使动 Active (-bu-, -(m)bu-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice shows that you are doing the action to something or someone. You would usually use the case marker ‘be’ to show what you are doing the action to. E.g.
* bi simbe manju gisun taci'''bu'''ha - I taught you Manchu
* bi imbe gene'''bu'''he - I let him go

&lt;u&gt;3) 被动 Passive	(-bu-, -(m)bu-)	&lt;/u&gt;

This voice shows that the action is being done to you. You would usually use the case marker ‘de’ to indicate the direction of the action. E.g. 
* bi tere de tanta'''bu'''ha - I was bashed up by him

&lt;u&gt;4) 方向去 Dir (to)	(-na-, -ne-, -no-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice shows the direction of an action and is similar to English ‘to go’. E.g.
* bithe hvla'''na'''mbi - To go and read
* si bithe uda'''na'''ci - If you go and buy books

&lt;u&gt;5) 方向来 Dir (fr)	(-ji-, -(n)ji-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice shows the direction of an action and is similar to English ‘to come’.E.g.
* bithe hvla'''ji'''mbi - To come and read
* Xiao Wang ya erinde isin'''ji'''mbi? - When does xiao Wang arrive?

&lt;u&gt;6) 齐动 Cooperative	(-ca-, -ce-, -co-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice indicates that an action is being done by a group. It is similar to the English word ‘together’. E.g.
* tese tacikv de efi'''ce'''mbi - They are playing together at school 
* eten i forgon de urgule'''ce'''he - Together we celebrate in victory

&lt;u&gt;7) 互动 Reciprocal	(-nu-, -ndu-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice is used to indicate reciprocal action. It is similar to the English word ‘each other’. E.g.
* nadan gurun ada'''ndu'''me nakarakv - The seven kingdoms fought each other without end
* niyalmasa ishunde aisila'''ndu'''mbi - The people help eachother out

&lt;u&gt;8) 连续 Continuous	 (-da-,-de-;-ta-,-te-;-xa-,-xe-,-xo-; -ca-,-ce-,-co-; -ja-,-je-, -jo-)&lt;/u&gt;

This voice is used to indicate the continuous nature of an action and is like English ‘always’, or ‘often’
* bi simbe aisila'''ta'''mbi - I often/always help you

====Forms (式) of the Manchu verb====

The Manchu verb has 6 basic forms:


&lt;u&gt;1) Affirmative &lt;/u&gt;

This is the normal form of the verb. E.g.
* bi te manju gisun be tacime ilihabi - I am currently studying Manchu
* boode mini ama bi - My father is at home
* bi abalara de indahvn gamambi - I take dogs when I go hunting


&lt;u&gt;2) Negative&lt;/u&gt;

This form is the negative form of the verb. Manchu unlike English forms the negative form of a verb by adding suffixes to the verb stem. The two negative forms of Manchu verbs are:

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Present negative 
| -rakv
|ara'''rakv'''
|Don’t write
|-
|Past negative
| -hakv  (-hekv, -hokv)
|ara'''hakv''' 
|Didn’t write
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the negative form are:
* bi harbin de gene'''hekv''' - I did not go to Harbin
* bi manju gisun be gisure'''rakv''' - I don't speak Manchu


&lt;u&gt;3) Interrogative&lt;/u&gt;

This is the question form of the verb. The interrogative form has both a positive and a negative form. The negative form is then further divided into a present and past negative interrogative form. The negative interrogative from is basically formed by adding -n to the end of the negative form of the verb (see table):

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Interrogative
| -o
|arara'''o'''?
|Are you writing?
|-
|Negative Interrogative (present)
| -rakvn
|ara'''rakvn'''? 
|Are you not writing?
|-
|Negative Interrogative (past)
| -hakvn(-hekvn, -hokvn)
|ara'''hakvn'''? 
|Did you not write?
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the interrogative form are:
* si abalara de indahvn gamambi'''o'''? - Do you take dogs when you go hunting?
* si xiao wang be tuwa'''rakvn'''? - Do you not see Xiao Wang?
* si harbin de gene'''hekvn'''? - Haven't you been to Harbin?


&lt;u&gt;4) Imperative&lt;/u&gt;

The imperative form is the form of the verb that is used when you want to tell somebody to do (or not do) something. In Manchu there is a polite imperative form, a negative imperative form and a normal imperative form (see table):

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Imperative
|
|ara 
|Write!
|-
|Imperative (negative)
|ume ……. -ra (-re, -ro) 
|ume ara'''ra'''
|Don’t write
|-
|Imperative (pol 1)
| -rao   (-reo, -roo)
|ara'''rao''' 
|Write please
|-
|Imperative (pol 1)
| -ki
|bu'''ki'''
|Please give
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the imperative form are:
* tuwa (look!)
* inde '''ume''' tuwa'''ra''' - Don't look at him
* si gala be obu'''roo''' - Wash your hands please
* minde tere bithe be bu'''ki''' - Can you please give me that book


&lt;u&gt;5) Optative&lt;/u&gt;

The optative form is where you want another person to do something. There are three different optative forms in Manchu (see table):

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Optative 1 
| -kini 
|ara'''kini''' 
|May he write
|-
|Optative 2
| -cina 
|ara'''cina''' 
|I hope you will write
|-
|Optative 3
| -kini sembi
|mara'''kini sembi'''
|I want you to return
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the optative form are:
* si ere buda be jacina - I hope you will eat this food
* bi simbe harbin hoton de genekini sembi - I want you to go to Harbin


&lt;u&gt;6) Desiderative&lt;/u&gt;

The desiderative form is where you want to do something. It corresponds to English I want to, or I will. Note the -ki form of the desiderative can also be used as a polite imperative. There are two different desiderative forms in Manchu (see table):

{|
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|Desiderative 1
| -ki
|ara'''ki'''
|I will write
|-
|Desiderative 2
| -ki sembi
|taci'''ki sembi'''
|I want to study
|-
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|.........................................
|-
|}

Some further examples of the desiderative form are:
* bi sinde majige okto bu'''ki''' - I will give you some medicine
* bi amga'''ki sembi''' - I want to sleep

# Big older brother where did you come from?
# I came from Seoul (Wang Kyeong (Korean) or Wang Jing(Chinese) means 'City of King', which means Seoul) in Korea
# Where are you going now?
# I am going towards the Capital city
# When did you leave Seoul?
# I set out on the first day of the month
# You left on the first day of the month, now it has nearly been half a month. How is it that you have only arrived here?
# A friend fell behind so I am travelling slow to wait for him, and that is way I am late.
# Has that friend caught up?
# This is that friend, he came yesterday
# Do you estimate that you will be able to make it to the capital by the end of the month?
# How would I know? If the heavens are kind and our health (body) is okay, then we should be able to.
# You are Korean! What free time did you have to study Chinese that well.
# I originally studied with Chinese people, and therefore I know a bit of Chinese
# Who did you study with?
# I studied at a Chinese school
# What type of books did you study?
# I studied the analects, Mengzi(Mencius) and some elementry school books.
# What classwork do you have each day
# Each day I get up at day break and go to school to study with my teacher. After class I go home and eat, and after that I go back to school to write and to recite books in front of my teacher.
# What books do you recite?
# I recite the Analects, Mengzi and some elementry school books.
# What classwork do you do after you have finished reciting the books?
# In the evening (after it becomes night) the teacher does a ballot to see who has to recite from memory. If the person can recite from memory  then my teacher gives them an avoid punishment card, if they can't then the managing Xiucai then tells them to lie down and they get hit three times with a piece of wood.
# How can it be that you get an avoid punishment card from the ballot to see who has to recite from memory?

==Grammar==

===Verbs (part 3)===


====Converbs (副动词)====

The main converbs in Manchu are:


&lt;u&gt;1) Coordinative	-me	&lt;/u&gt;

This converb modifies the following verb and can be used to link several verbs. It also expresses simultaneous action, or can be used to start a quote. E.g.
* ai baita be ara'''me''' genembi? (what are you going to do)	
* yacin gvlmahvn sakda niman i boode efi'''me''' genehe (the black rabbit went to the old mountain goat's house to play.)
* suwe ai erinde guri'''me''' jihengge? (when did you move here?)
* ajige xanyan gvlmahvn jabu'''me''':... (the small white rabbit said:....)


&lt;u&gt;2) Subordinative	-fi	&lt;/u&gt;

Refers to a sequence of actions where one action is completed before another one begins. It is like English 'then', and also a bit like 'because' E.g.
* bi gene'''fi''' tuwaki (I will go and (then) have a look)	
* ajige yacin gvlmahvn lafu sogi be gai'''fi''', hendume:&quot;yeyede baniha!&quot;  (the small black rabbit took the bok choi and then said: thank you grandfather)
* yacin gvlmahvn ningge jetere jaka akv o'''fi''', geli sakda niman i boode sogi baime genehe (As the small black rabit had nothing to eat, he then went to the old mountain goat's house to ask for more vegetables)


&lt;u&gt;3) Conditional	-ci&lt;/u&gt;

This is the conditional converb and is similar to English 'if'. E.g.
* bi tuwa'''ci''' (if I look)	
* jalan de suwe akv'''ci''' ergen de jurgan akv ni (If this world did not have you all, then life would have no meaning)
* si Harbin de gene'''ci''' (if you go to Harbin)


&lt;u&gt;4) Durative	-hai (-hei, -hoi)&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is used to express that an action occurs or continues at the same time as another action is performed. E.g.
* necimbi'''hei''' yabumbi (to continuously invade)	


&lt;u&gt;5) Terminative	-tala (-tele, -tolo)	&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is used to show that an action occurs up to a certain time.
* ara'''tala''' (until he writes)
* te'''tele''' (till now)	 


&lt;u&gt;6) Instrumental	-tai (-tei, -toi)&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is used to show that an action is being forced
* buce'''tei''' daharakv (I will not submit even if I die)	


&lt;u&gt;7) Preparative	-nggala (-nggele, -nggolo)&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is like English ‘before’
* utala inenggi o'''nggolo''' (several days ago)


&lt;u&gt;8) Concessive	-cibe	&lt;/u&gt;

This converb is like Enlgish ‘although’
* tuttu bi'''cibe''' (although it is like that)


&lt;u&gt;9) Alternative	-ralame (-relame, -rolame)&lt;/u&gt;	

This converb is used to show that two actions are being performed at the same time
* bi yabu'''ralame''' tuwambi (looking as I’m going along)


&lt;u&gt;10) Simultaneous	-mbime&lt;/u&gt;	

This converb is used to show that one action is occurring (or not) while another action takes place
* si baita be sambi se'''mbime''', ainu takarakv (while you say you know about the matter, how come you don’t?)

====auxiliary verbs (助动词)====

Three important auxiliary verbs in Manchu are:
* sembi – sembi means ‘to say’
* ombi – ‘ombi’ can be translated as ‘to become’, ‘to be’, ‘to act as’,  
* bimbi – ‘bimbi’ can be translated as ‘to be or ‘is’.



====Irregular verbs (table)====

This table is a list of all the irregular Manchu verbs and their irregular forms. Note a blank space indicates that this form of the verb is regular. Note verbs where the suffix ‘-fi’ becomes ‘-pi’ or ‘-mpi’ are not included.

===Adverbs===

Adverbs are words that modify other words except for nouns. Adverbs usually express the time, place or degree of an action and typically answer questions such as how?, when? why? or where? Manchu adverbs can be primitive adverbs which are indeclinable words such as ‘inu’ (yes) or they can be formed by adding suffixes (usually case markers) to the end of nouns, or pronouns. Most numerals can also be used as adverbs.


Some common Manchu adverbs include:

{| cellpadding=&quot;15&quot;
 | valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;|'''''Cyperus esculentus''''' (yellow nutsedge) is a perennial, grass-like plant that is a common perennial weed of gardens and lawns. The leaves are shiny and yellowish, with spiny flowers appearing in late summer. 

The plant spreads aggressively by underground stolons, and in late summer also produces small starchy tubers. The plant can grow back from very small root fragments, so the soil should be loosened with a claw-type cultivator when pulling, and diligence is required for several months to attain full control

Wet or compacted soils favor the growth of this plant, so improving soil structure and drainage is the most effective long-term control.

==Translation==

# Each person makes a wooden card and writes their name on it. The cards are all put in a container and the Xiucai in charge takes the container, shakes it, and takes out one of the cards. The person whose card is chosen then needs to recite something, and if they recite well then the teacher will give them a get out of punishment card. On the card it is written: &quot;avoid three hits with the wood &quot;, and on top of it there is a seal. If the person can't recite (the text), they can take out the card and tear it up, and use their previous acheivement to avoid getting hit.  If the person doesn't have a get out of punishment card, then they will certainly receive three hits with the wood.
# What do you study Chinese for?
# Although what you say may be so, I still think that it is not completely like that. Now that the emperor has unified the four seas, and all is ruled under heaven, the places where (the populous) uses Chinese are many. As for our Korean language, it is only used in Korea (Korean land). When you pass Yizhou and arive in Chinese territory, because everyone speaks Chinese, if somebody asks you a question and you stare and are unable to answer, what kind of a person will other people look at you as? 
# Did you study Chinese because you like it or because your parents told you to study it?
# My mother and father told me to study it
# How many years have you studied for?
# I have studied for more than half a year
# Do you know it all?
# I know a bit because I live and study with Chinese Xiucai (students) each day 
# What kind of person is your teacher?
# He is Chinese
# How old is he?
# 35 years old
# Does he teach diligently?
# Our teacher is originally (very) humble, and therefore is very dilligent in his teaching.
# Out of the Xiucai how many are Chinese and how many are Korean?
# Exactly half are Chinese and half are Korean.
# Are there also bad students?
# Why would there not be bad ones? Although the the head Xiucai reports the bad students to the teacher and they get hit, they do not know fear. In this the Chinese children's nature is really bad. The Korean students seem a bit more well behaved.
# Big older brother where are you going now?
# I am also going towards the capital city.
# As you are going to the capital city, and I am Koren and am not familiar with the way, how would it be if I was to accompany you as a friend?
# That is very good, we shall go together.
# Older brother what is your surname?
# My surname is Wang

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lepidoptera includes butterflies, moths, and skippers.

== Development ==

Butterflies undergo complete metamorphosis, that includes four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (imago).

==== Egg ====
Eggs are extremely varied among lepidopterans. Many species can be identified by their eggs. Eggs are generally laid on the ''host plants'' of lepidopterans, so that once hatched the larva will have a food supply.

==== Caterpillar ====
Like other larvae, the only purpose of this stage is growth. During this stage the caterpillar spends most of its time eating. In this stage, the caterpillar's anatomy is quite simple. Its eyes are very simple, only capable of determining light from dark. The caterpillar has 3 pairs of true legs located on its thorax, and 5 pairs of false legs called ''prolegs'' on its abdomen. Also, the digestive tract is particularly pronounced in this stage, making up most of the internal organs of the caterpillar.
The appearance of caterpillars is also quite varied. Some are described as &quot;worms,&quot; with only bare, plain-coloured bodies. Some are bare, but have more brightly coloured bodies. Others have hair or spines that have poisons that aid in self-defense.

==== Chrysalis ====
[[Image:Pupation - Inachis io.jpg|200px|thumb|right|the process of pupation]]
After a number of growth periods, called instars, a caterpillar will find a spot, often a plant (other species may burrow into the ground), and forms a pupa. The lepidopteran may form something called a ''cremaster'' so that it remains attached to the plant it has chosen. The cremaster is made of silk. Species called silkmoths will spin a cocoon made of silk.
The pupa of a lepidoptera is called a chrysalis. During this stage a process called ''histolysis'' occurs, in which the organs of the caterpillar &quot;dissolve&quot; and reform in a process called ''histogenesis''. Many species overwinter in this form.

Hi Kahuroa,

Thanks for your contributions to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Outreach/Maori Lore|Maori Lore]] honor.  I am certainly not an expert on the subject, though I do find it fascinating.  So far, all the answers that have been added have been gleaned from places such as Wikipedia.  Please feel free to add more information, and if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:12, 28 June 2008 (UTC)
: I just just your contribution history, and apparently, I should thank you for more than just the work you did yesterday.  Looks like you did a lot of the writing about Maori in Wikipedia which I imported here.  Thanks so much for that!  I obviously found it useful! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:28, 28 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Importance in this Digital Age==

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy Information literacy] has become an important skill for students to gain before they enter real world. Information literacy can be defined as being able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use it effectively . In the past there was one main way to get information and it was by going to a library and finding a published source. Technology has made more and more information readily available. The digital age has brought about new sources that in the past would never have been even thought of. The Internet provides us with a background on almost any topic imaginable. To be literate one must find the information in a reasonable amount time. Because there is so much information pinpointing what you need and what you don’t has become a necessary skill. Using the correct search engine and searching with the correct specifications could save you hours by locating the correct information. There is much more to being literate than finding information. You must be able to decipher between good and poor sources. Some websites have information that is inaccurate and has no basis. It is important that we are aware of where the information we gather originates. Each source must be evaluated before it is used.  It is imperative that we model new ways of teaching and learning in today's society.  We need to help our students be successful in the 21st century -- the world in which we now live is constantly changing.  We need to help prepare our students for occupations that do not even exist today.  We have transitioned from using desktop-based applications to new online tools, and ultimately we are able to work differently.  The web is now highly interactive, not merely a one-way street where someone controls the content.  We need to provide new tools to our students so that they are prepared for the new challenges our world will bring them.</text>

==What is an Information Literacy Model and how is it relevant?==

In 1989, the American Library Association (ALA) endorsed a widely held definition for Information Literacy, as the &quot;ability to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information&quot; (ALA,*). With the ability to connect to the Web, student access to all types of information is expanding.  Because of this influx of information, students need to learn how to locate credible sources. A variety of information literacy models are available to help students locate reliable sources.  These models provide steps for planning and conducting meaningful research.  Educators are free to edit a model to fit the individual needs of a student, a classroom, or a discipline.

==Information Literacy Models==

There have been several models developed to help locate reliable information in the digital age. WebQuests, 5As and the Scientific method models have all been created to facilitate information literacy skills in the digital age. 

* [http://www.virtualinquiry.com/inquiry/webquest.htm Webquests] provide a technology rich learning experience which utilizes several internet resources.
 
* The [http://www.virtualinquiry.com/inquiry/as.htm 5As] model lists five steps which help students become information literate. According to this model one must ask a key question, access relevant information, analyze information, apply it toward a task and finally assess the end result.
 
* The [http://www.virtualinquiry.com/inquiry/inquiry2.htm scientific model] method applies the scientific method towards information literacy. All of these models allow the users to walk through a problem by using technology.


Three of the most popular types of models include Search and Use, Information Inquiry, and Discipline Specific. Many different models exist within each of the three types. Search and Use models often involve gathering and processing information. 

* [http://www.virtualinquiry.com/inquiry/models.htm '''Search and Use'''] include the 5As, FLIP IT, REACTS, and InfoZone. 

* '''Information Inquiry models''' focus on questioning, researching, and analyzing the information at hand. The 8Ws, I-Search, Pathways to Knowledge, [http://webquest.sdsu.edu/ Webquests], and the Research cycle are all examples of this type of model. 

* '''Discipline Specific models''' are designed to aid in further understanding of a particular subject. The most common Discipline Specific model is the Scientific Method. Others include [http://www.mathoutofthebox.org/ Math Out of the Box], [http://www.primarysourcelearning.org/db/LE/display.php?p=Overview&amp;k=173 Zoom-In Inquiry], and the Suchman Inquiry model. 

While these are just a few of the examples of literacy models, many more exist, and creating a literacy model that is tailored to your classrooms needs can be a fun and exciting challenge (Callison &amp; Lamb, 2006; Moss, 2008; Primary Source Learning, 2007; Prince William County Public Schools, 2008)!

==Models Effectiveness==

These information literacy models are effective tools and allow students to analyze information in a systematic method. They serve as a guide for students to learn and also as a guide to help teachers teach the concept of information literacy. These models can be very effective if teachers utilize them. The models show students that they can and should question the information presented to them, and they give students a method with which to judge. Many of these models use graphic organizers or numbered steps to help students break up their search of visualize what they are doing. They present a chronological order to help the student progress through the questioning path. They are directed to students and can be found for every grade and skill level. All of these tools are practical tools that will help organize student thought so that they may learn new information.

==Comparison of Information Literacy Models==

[[Image:Figure_2.1.jpg#file|right|thumb|Figure 2.1 provides a visual comparison of various stages from a few strategies]]

Information literacy requires students to utilize their critical thinking skills in order to successfully uncover and synthesize information.  Although designed to foster and promote inquiry by the students, each strategy has its own unique recipe to achieve this goal.  

The Search &amp; Use strategies are designed to promote higher-order thinking and decision making by students.  The Information Inquiry Model provides opportunities for revision and reconsideration of the information while encouraging its integration.  The Discipline Specific Models, unlike the others, were designed for certain areas of study, such as math and science.

== Information Literacy Theories ==

What is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Information_Literacy_in_the_K12_Classroom/Chapter_1.1 information literacy]? This ambiguous term can possess a slightly different meaning from one individual to the next. In this chapter we will explain the meaning of information literacy according to two different theories: [http://wwwfp.education.tas.gov.au/english/critlit.htm critical literacy theory] and [http://www.psychologymatters.org/selfdetermin.html self-determination theory]. As you read how each theory relates to information literacy, think about how you employ each, if any, of the theories in your classroom.



===Critical Literacy Theory===	

Critical literacy theory originates from Paolo Freire who threw out the idea that the focus of education should be the transferring of information from one source (e.g. teachers, books, and computers) to the student. Instead, critical literacy theory encourages readers to question the information they come across rather than passively accept it. So, as educators, we need to teach students the tools to read critically and individually.

How does this affect information literacy? In itself, critical literacy theory challenges the status quo of what individuals should do with the information they ingest. In relation to information literacy, critical literacy theory moves the once vague definition toward a brighter and more efficient light. Though, before a solid definition is given, we must clearly define information and literacy as separate entities in the critical literacy theory bubble. Information is the “raw material” we use to solve our problems, and we use it to create individual understandings and identities. Literacy consists of “multiliteracies”, similar to Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences. Each type of literacy is unique to its setting. An example is academic literacy which is “the ability to read, interpret, and produce information valued in academia.” (Elmnorg, 2006)
Combining the two, information literacy can be defined as the ability to be a self-sufficient learner who asks questions, and is able to develop a unique interpretation of the given information.



===Self-determination Theory===

Self-determination theory originates from Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, and refers to an intrinsic motivation to do something, in our case to learn, versus extrinsic motivation. An example of being intrinsically motivated would be when students are able to choose what topic their research project will cover. An example of being extrinsically motivated is if the teacher tells the students exactly what topic their research needs to cover, thus not allowing any choice in the project. According to Sherry Crow (2007), intrinsic motivation is the key to productive information literacy because students need to desire searching for and interpreting information. If students are given opportunities of choice, they feel a sense of self-initiation, and thus the need for autonomy are met, and they are more likely to succeed at the task, and learn more along the way.

How does this fit in with information literacy? According to Crow, &quot;The goal is to assist all students in becoming active and creative locators, evaluators, and users of information to solve problems and to satisfy their own curiosity&quot; through the use of “21st century information skills.” The educational mission now lies in developing a way to teach information literacy to our youth rather than figure out its definition.

Informational Literacy With ELL Learners

Informational literacy is important to all learners but has special importance for the job of TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) and ELLs (English Language Learners). This type of learner is not only learning the academic aspects of the content material, but also learning linguistic proficiency of another language.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==ESL and Information Literacy==
'''Information Literacy and English Language Learners'''

Educators of students who are learners of the English language attending English-speaking schools are charged with a large responsibility with regard to their students' academic success - now and in the future. As a classroom teacher, the idea of getting curriculum across to [http://www.alliance.brown.edu/tdl/ell.shtml English-language learners] is daunting enough, but the added responsibility of ensuring that these students are prepared for higher education and careers in the digital age presents an even greater challenge. Given that many English-language learners may not have access to technology and many digital devices at home, educators must work with their students to set goals utilizing available educational technology in order to help them become and stay competitive in the academic community. It is important for the teacher to ensure that students not ony have access to the tools, but are allocated the time needed to practice and really learn [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_literacy#Specific_aspects_of_information_literacy information literacy] skills.

==Development of Information Gathering Skills==

According to S.C. Yang (2001), English-language learners often approach digital-age resources with both &quot;excitement and anxiety.&quot; In order to help these students to become informational literate, teachers must approach the instruction utilizing educational technology in a learner-centered, project-based and goal-directed manner. For example, students can accomplish many technology and research objectives through the creation of informational brochures that go along with curriculum. Students set goals for their final product, conduct the research and produce the project using educational technology. A sample lesson plan for this type of activity entitled, [http://reta.nmsu.edu/lessons/desktop/lessona.html &quot;Desktop Publishing: Sell Your Hometown Brochure,&quot;] may be found at the New Mexico State University website. Utilizing technology for information gathering purposes requires that students develop effective critical thinking skills and problem-solving strategies, which for the educator of English-language learners means making the instruction interactive and individualized with specific project goals to be met. (Bagnole &amp; Miller, 2003) [http://school.discoveryeducation.com/schrockguide/webquest/sld003.html WebQuests] are an excellent activity for elementary and secondary students to use for utilizing information literacy skills. Further, in order to effect success in instruction of English-language learners in information gathering activities, their access to and practice with technological resources must be regular and intensive. (Bagnole &amp; Miller, 2003) There are many problem-based lesson plans availaible for helping students increase information gathering skills, that may be easily adapted for use with ESL students. [http://www.coe.uga.edu/epltt/LessonPlans/martypalmer.html| The New Infotectives: Tracking Down Good Information on the Web] is a one such lesson plan.

==Using Technology to Develop Language Skills==

In the past, teachers of English-language learners have used various media such as audiotapes, television, and videotapes in an effort to further develop English language skills. (Masterson, 2008) These media are still useful, however the use of the additional digital technology available today opens the door to many more learning opportunities for these students. The text, graphics, sounds, and video available through technology today encourage immersion in the language. Successful use of technological resources by English-language learners can give them ownership of their learning and a sense of power or self-confidence.

==Verbal Interaction with Electronic Resources==

Educators need to provide English-language learners with a language-rich environment in which they are afforded many opportunities to interact verbally with their peers. Computers offer a nonjudgmental resource for verbal interaction. Computer read alouds, music, and sound effects provide English-language learners with an audible language source. Computer books may be used to facilitate verbal language learning in that students may be read to by the software, read the books themselves, read the books aloud, and share ideas or opinions about the books with other students. The [http://www.icdlbooks.org/ International Children's Digital Library] offers children's literature in the form of free computer books, written in a number of languages, that may be read by students of all ages.

==Development of Vocabulary==

Beginning English learners need to experience the vocabulary visually and contextually. Given that the very nature of digital technology is graphic, computers offer ESL students a very contextual, as well as nonthreatening, environment. Students can interact with the computer and learn the English vocabulary using a variety of visual experiences. Schools may purchase various software packages for use with vocabulary development, but there are several online sources as well.

* [http://teacher.scholastic.com/activities/bll/ Building Language for Literacy] is a Scholastic site for early language learners that gives audio feedback to students to help build vocabulary, identify letters, and lay the groundwork for successful decoding skills. 
* [http://www.tv411.org/vocabulary/ TV411 Vocabulary] is a site that offers various vocabulary lessons (such as &quot;Finding New Ways to Say Something&quot; for older learners with real-life applications. 
* [http://www.eduplace.com/tales Wacky Web Tales] is a fun site in which students create new stories by filling in the blanks with the types of words requested (i.e., singular noun, large number, country, etc.). The premise of this site is similar to an &quot;Ad-Lib.&quot;

==Reading and Writing Development==

When English-language learners are beginning to learn their second language, all types of exposure to language are helpful in developing their literacy skills. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital Digital technology] offers a fun and interesting way to practice those literacy skills. While writing for early language learners tends to be difficult, and instruction needs to be guided to reduce frustration, the use of computer graphics and technically-related projects may increase the enjoyment of writing for these students. (Ybarra &amp; Green, 2003) Through the use of classroom blogs and discussion boards, students may practice their reading and writing skills in, again, a nonthreatening environment. Online dictionaries (such as [http://www.wordcentral.com/home.html Merriam-Webster's Word Central]), spell-checking devices, and grammar-checking devices make it easy for students to edit their own work. The completion of projects researched and produced using technology (such as brochures and newspapers) give English-language learners the opportunity to synthesize their informational literacy skills with the reading and writing skills they have acquired.

==Conclusion==

As the population of our country changes due to the increase of immigrants from other nations, and schools in the U.S. often educate student populations with multiple home languages, educators need to employ the educational technology available to them to help these students achieve academic success. Educators need to ensure that English-language learners set goals, engage in the language, are afforded access to and rigorous practice in utilizing technology resources for development of information gathering skills, verbal ability, vocabulary development, reading and writing development. Through the regular use of technology, students are empowered and made responsible for their own learning. (Mydlarski, 1999) All students - ESL and other - may acquire the content knowledge required, along with the informational literacy skills needed in order to be competitive in the academic world of tomorrow.

== Information Literacy and Differentiation ==


Differentiated instruction addresses the challenge of fully engaging a classroom of students with a variety of learning styles and abilities. It involves adjusting the curriculum, teaching strategies, and classroom environment to meet the needs of all students. [http://cainc.com/professional-development/topics/DiffInstruction/index.htm Differentiation ]tailors instruction to each individual’s diverse learning styles and abilities since all students do not learn in the same way or at the same pace (Lewis, n.d.). A differentiated classroom respects the heterogeneity among and between learners and modifies the curriculum so that learning, growth, and individual success are maximized for all students (Peterson, 2006).

Through assessment of students’ skills, interests, background knowledge, readiness, and preferences in learning styles, teachers gain insight on the most appropriate ways to differentiate instruction to diverse learners who are studying within the same curriculum (Hall, 2002). The range of diversity may include differentiation to be based on special needs or gifted abilities (Haywood, n.d.). [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_intelligences Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences]includes tailoring the content, process, and products to meet learning preferences as displayed in the figure below. Assessment is also used as a reflective tool to continually adjust instruction to optimize the learning experience.

[http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/mi/w1_interactive1.html Multiple Intelligence Self Assessment]

[[File:HG_Chart_differ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Howard Gardner and Multiple Intelligence]]


In order for differentiation to be successful, there needs to be an appropriate balance of teacher-selected and student-selected options. The teacher uses a variety of instructional strategies that are principle driven. Clearly established goals and criteria are present as students work in a flexible range of collaborative settings (Hall, 2002). Through differentiation, the teacher respects the needs of all students and modifies the learning environment to meet them. 

[http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlissues/acrlinfolit/infolitoverview/infolitforfac/infolitfaculty.cfm Information literacy] provides students with the knowledge and skills to effectively access information, while accurately evaluating and assessing that information to see if it is what is needed. True information literacy calls upon a combination of a rich variety of skills and knowledge. If educators are to instill such skills into a classroom with a diverse community of learners, differentiation must be employed. These particular Information Literacy skills include questioning, identifying and collecting, evaluating, sense making, reflecting and refining, using, and assessing information and resources. Specific lesson plans to implement and teach these skills can be found at the [http://www.kn.pacbell.com/wired/21stcent/sitemap.html#questioning 21st Centuries Literacies].

== Motivation ==


A key to motivating students in any learning situation is to connect the information to the real world. If students can understand how knowledge they are learning in a classroom relates and can be applied to situations outside the schoolroom walls, they will better comprehend the information and be more motivated to learn. Going further, if educators differentiate their lessons, students will have an added incentive to learn through a lesson designed to meet their learning needs. A variety of strategies can be utilized by teachers that develop students' information literacy while differentiating in ways that motivate the learner. The following table summarizes Barbara Gross Davis's (1993) strategies for increasing student motivation in the classroom.



[[File:Chart_motivation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Strategies to Motivate Students]]


== Strategies ==

Though an independent process, information literacy is best taught as an integration within the content areas. There are four main types of learning approaches that teachers can utilize to incorporate the acquisition of information literacy skills while meeting the learning needs of individual students. Those approaches are:


* [http://www.centralischool.ca/~bestpractice/resource/index.html Resource-based learning:]
**Students construct meaning through an interaction with a wide range of print, non-print, and human resources.
** [http://english.unitecnology.ac.nz/resources/units/planets/home.html A unit on the solar system] can use the resource-based learning model as an example. Students can examine the solar system through books, websites, posters, charts, videos, and perhaps even a trip to an observatory.

* [http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/inquiry/index.html Inquiry-based learning:]

[http://www.slideshare.net/ulamb/differentiated-instruction-strategy-raft# This Power Point]provides ideas for using the RAFT (Role, Audience, Format, Topic) strategy to differentiate content and provide students with choices for self-directed learning. This is an excellent cross-curricular strategy that provides teachers with ready-made ideas to start &quot;RAFTing&quot; today.

Another great differentiation strategy is using [http://www.slideshare.net/ulamb/using-graphic-organizers-to-differentiate-instruction graphic organizers]. This presentation will explain the concept and provide ideas for implementation. 


This [http://www.slideshare.net/ulamb/di-lesson-plan-template lesson plan] template will guide you with questions that aide in the creation of a differentiated lesson. 


** Students learn by doing

** [http://english.unitecnology.ac.nz/resources/units/planets/home.html A unit on the solar system] One example of an inquiry-based lesson that also incorporates technology is to teleconference students researchers working in the field to ask them questions regarding a particular unit of study.

* [http://www.imsa.edu/programs/pbln/overview/mission.php Problem-based learning:]Students collaborate to solve problems and reflect on their experiences.

** One way to incorporate problem-based learning into the classroom would be a [http://www.ncsu.edu/pbl/pdf/hugandkiss.pdf lesson in which students role play,] assuming roles such as town manager, parents, school boards officials, architects to determine the best use of an inheritance. Should they build a new library or a recreational center? 

** [http://www.edutopia.org/project-learning Project-based learning]Students explore real-world problems and challenges. For example, Scholastic offers a lesson in which students [http://teacher.scholastic.com/activities/wwii/memory/index.htm create a World War II memory book.]The site explains how to interview people who lived and possibly fought during the war as well as how to publish the results of their interviews. 

View the Edutopia [http://www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning-overview video to generate more ideas on Problem Based Learning]

[[File:FilmRoll-small.png|40px|http://www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning-overview]] 


Using the above models can help teachers not only provide lessons that are exciting, but they also differentiate lessons. They would be motivating as well because students can make connections across the curriculum. In addition, they show students how knowledge learned inside the classroom can connect to the world outside the classroom. Adding technology and Web 2.0 tools can further students' development of information literacy. These may include student blogs were they may reflect on reading assignments so that they can better evaluate and assess knowledge or creating oral family history podcasts as a means to question the world around them in an attempt to better understanding it.

&quot;Innovations in technology have facilitated the use of these methods and learning approaches and often revitalize students' interest in learning. Engaging students in the learning process - encouraging them to ask and answer questions, having them use a rich variety of resources, providing real-life situations to help them grasp content, and creating learning environments where they can work collaboratively with others to further their understanding of curriculum - is what helps them gain lifelong learning information skill&quot; (AT&amp;T Education, 2008).

|next=Chapter 6.1}}


== Information Literacy and Technology Tools ==
 

There are many tools that are available for students to use for information literacy. The tools help students find information, analyze and understand the information, and then use the information. The three main tools available for student use for information literacy are:

* the internet

* collaboration tools

* sharing tools



== The Internet ==
 

The new web 2.0 allows students to find information much more easily than before. Students can use various search engines to help them find information much more easily than before. There are many different search engines. There are also websites that review each search engine, such as [http://searchenginewatch.com/ search engine watch]. Students can go to a website like search engine watch and find a search engine that will be most helpful to their research. There are also search engines built specifically for students, such as [http://kids.yahoo.com/ Yahoo Kids].



== Collaboration Tools ==
 

The collaboration tools that are available allow students to work together outside of their classroom. The most widely used collaboration tools in classrooms are wikis and blogs.


* [[Introduction to Information Literacy in the K12 Classroom/Chapter 6.1 Blogs | Blogs]] are a way of writing ones thoughts and ideas about topics that may be shared with many people. A student’s collaborating partners may reply and give them feedback or their opinions on the subject. What a great way to keep an electronic journal! Students can also gain other thoughts on events or other things that may have happened. There are many blog sites for students to choose from. Many school systems are using their own applications to allow students to express themselves in a smaller area. [http://www.angellearning.com Angel] and [http://http://blackboard.com/us/index.bbb Blackboard] are examples of applications schools are utilizing. 

 
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki Wikis] allow for similar collaboration that will permit several people to write and adjust the writing on the same posting without sending a reply. [http://www.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia] is probably the best example of a wiki. There are numerous other sites that allow for this tool to be utilized.


* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging Instant Messaging](IM) allows for communication in real time and can garner a response in seconds. Most ISps allow for some sort of instant messaging. [https://my.screenname.aol.com/_cqr/login/login.psp?seamless=novl&amp;sitedomain=sns.aimexpress.aol.com&amp;lang=en&amp;locale=us&amp;authLev=2&amp;siteState=ver%3a1%252c0%26ac%3aAE%26ld%3aaimexpress.aol.com%26uv%3aAIM%26lc%3aen-us%26ud%3aaol.com%26br%3aWebSuite-AimExBeta AOL] instant messenger is an example of IM. 


* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_telephony Internet Telephony] is also being introduced. Voice over Internet Protocol (VolP) allows conversations over the internet. [http://www.skype.com/ Skype] is probably the most common telephony. [http://www.voip.com/ Voip] is another example of internet telephony. 


* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter Twitter]is another tool that students can use to collaborate with other students. Students can log into their Twitter account and in 140 characters or less, post updates or websites for others to view. 

     View the [http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=2191d23fab7566e28bec Inquiry Learning Video] Twitter video tutorial to learn more  [[Image:FilmRoll-small.png|40px|http://www.teachertube.com/view_video.php?viewkey=2191d23fab7566e28bec ]].

* [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Information_Literacy_in_the_K12_Classroom/Chapter_6.2 Open Source Software] is another tool that schools can use to create more collaboration possibilities.  These are applications where the user can download the entire program free of charge. In general, the definition provides for your freedom to use, modify and redistribute the software in any way you wish. There are no licensing fees to pay, and any costs associated with open source software typically are for staff training or specialized support from a third-party company for implementation assistance (Hirsch, 2009, para.6).



== Sharing Tools ==


There are also sharing tools that allow students to share websites, movies, and photos. Students can use social bookmarking sites (such as [http://del.icio.us/ delicious]) and share their favorite websites with their friends. More importantly, when students use these social bookmarking sites, they can log onto any computer and access their favorite websites. There are also websites which allow students to upload their movies or photos to share with classmates or the public. These sharing websites allow students to showcase their talents and collaborate with others.



== Activity ==

If you do not have a blog, watch the video ''Blogs in Plain English'', about how to create a blog and then bot to Blogger.com to  [http://www.blogger.com create a blog now!] If you already have a blog, choose one tool described here and reflect on how you can use this tool in your classroom.

== Information Literacy and the Application of Technology Tools ==


As mentioned in the Tools section, Information Literacy in the Digital Age, requires students and teachers to be able to access and manipulate a variety of technological instruments. With so many tools to choose from, proper application of a tool can some times be difficult to figure out.

Information Literacy Digital Age tools also promote professional development, which allows teachers, administrators and librarians to have regular conversations, take actions and to determine appropriate goals and objectives for its schools and maintain a wiki to share agendas, notes and ideas between schools (Derry, B. 2008 p. 23). According to Derry, not only do these Information Literacy tools create engaging learning activities that challenge students to think at a higher level, they also educate staff on the use and integration of skills and strategies (Derry, 2008 p. 24) for the betterment of these students' learning experiences. 

These Information Literacy Digital Age tools may include wikis, social networking, digital storytelling (PhotoStory and Podcasting) tools; as well as interactive whiteboards, (Derry, 2008 p. 24), blogging, screencasting, streaming videos, Podcasts, Skype, digital video communication and other Web 2.0 tools to construct new paradigms for teaching and learning (Derry, 2008 p. 25). 

When should we use a blog vs. a Wiki? And, at what point should the librarian step in to help our students understand how to utilize the technological tools available to them?

Need help deciding? Maybe this can help: 


[[Image:Choices.jpg|thumb|200px|center|View the [http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cj1Uo9VgO Wikis Vs. Blog Screencast]]]

==Wikis ==


The Wiki is an instrument of collaboration and cooperation. A teacher can use the Wiki to help students improve their writing as well as their editing and revising skills. Through a small research project, or written assignment, students can work in small groups to peer edit or collaborate on written assignments . Wikis can also be used for distance learning with students who have a variety of needs (Birch, 2008).
Ideas for using wikis in the classroom include:


* Storing Web sites and bibliographies that might enhance a research project, as well as critique these websites for the information provided
* Groups mind-mapping and brainstorming of ideas
* Connecting with home schooled children to discuss assignments and papers
* Editing and annotating lessons to help students see how to and what to edit in their papers using proper techniques
* Post critical or analytical statements directly on the work being looked at, students have a better time when they can write directly on a piece and see the correlation of their ideas to the work itself
* Collaborating with distance learners in another district or country--the more students interact with others who have different values and ideals, the more understanding, tolerant and worldly they become (perhaps even running a community outreach program or generating ideas for a community service project

To take it up a notch, use a Wiki to keep track of student projects. Each project has its own page where students can post progress reports and add images, audio and other files. Or, make the project classwide: ask students to collaborate on a study guide, a manual, an encyclopedia or a glossary. Culinary students can help each other improve recipes, IT students can collaborate on developing source code, and future teachers can work out hypothetical lesson plans (Imperatore, 2009, p. 30).

For career exploration, students can create a Wiki for career resources that describes different jobs and the education and training required, as well as local employment opportunities. Introducing Wikis in the classroom is not without its challenges. &quot;Wikis conflict with traditional assumptions about authorship and intellectual property,&quot; according to contributors on http://writingwiki.org. This Web site encourages educators to introduce students to the conventions of collaborative work, creating a style guide for the Wiki and discussing how contributors will be recognized (Imperatore, 2009, p. 31).

Look to [http://Wikispaces.com Wikispaces] and [http://PBwiki.com PBwiki] to help you begin! More Ideas can be found at [http://blog.pbwiki.com/2007/08/24/15-educators-respond-how-would-you-use-pbwiki-in-your-classroom/ How do educators use Wikis?] and [http://classroomblogging.wikispaces.com/%3E+Using+Wikis Ideas with Wikis!]

==Blogs ==

Blogs are used for more personal reflections, journaling, or responding to prompts. Students can use them for book discussions, publishing daily work, getting to know one another, or as writing practice (Barret, 2006; Barrios 2004). Teachers may find blogs useful for posting homework assignments, updating classroom activities, and observing/creating classroom portfolios (Teaching Today 2007). 

* Publish daily, by responding to prompts given by the teacher to think critically on course content and its application to the world
* Give updates to real world issues: surviving after an environmental disaster, overcoming an illness, losing a loved one--have students reach out with&lt;br&gt;their blog to offer support and keep up with current events to share in class
* Provide links to interesting facts and ideas that will effect the students like rezoning of a school district, budget increases/decreases, implementation&lt;br&gt;of school uniforms etc. Have the students think critically and respond to the situation, while also commenting on fellow classmates blogs
* Post daily homework problems for mathematics that the students can write out a small paragraph describing the thought process to discovering the answer
* Have students use blogs to post questions and allow other students to help respond and answer each others questions--it encourages community and critical&lt;br&gt;thinking in the classroom
* Use the blog to post important due dates for students work. If there are any questions about assignments, students can take the initiative to post and&lt;br&gt;discuss on the blog with their instructor.

The following blogging websites give teachers excellent examples of how mathematical teachers, history teachers and science teachers are using a blog format to share and to find new strategies in the teaching and learning of their content area. Teachers display lesson plans, resources, puzzles, quizzes presentations, other valuable links, and much, much more. 

The teachers are finding interesting and useful ways to journal their thoughts, discuss relevant problems and solutions, and make available to students and teachers, current 21st Century learning activities. As well, it gives students a voice in their learning and to think and write about their content subjects and publish it online.

In fact, there are many websites for blogging in different content areas. Any teacher can go to an online searching tool and place “blogging websites for”, along with whatever content area they are looking, for in the search box and find many useful websites.

== Google Wave ==

Google just introduced a new powerful tool, Google Wave, in May 2009.  The most important aspect of this reinvented new tool is open sourced.  What we can do with this powerful tool is almost anything possible that we used to do separately – emails, chat, blog, wiki, game, comments on document, video, maps, twitter, ... you name it all within Google Wave.  And we are able to do it by real-time live collaboration and communication.  

Harris stated, “Students collaborating on an assignment could use a wave to collect, organize, and publish a final document without having to repeatedly exchange word processor files” (Harris, 2009).  

One of the significant characteristics in Google Wave is that it provides live translation of our text as we type in chatting.  “Just imagine the potential for enhancing communication in schools and librries” (Harris, 2009).
I view this is just a beginning of a huge impact ahead of us.  How can educators get ready for our students?  I truly hope this topic will be updated by the future contributors because it is very interesting to watch the progress.

== More Importantly: Why? ==


Using the new tools: wiki’s, blogs, podcasting, etc. in your classroom will create a learning environment that the students enjoy being part of. They will become more focused, engaged and excited about their learning experiences because it is what they know and do best. Robyn Henderson of the University of Southern Queensland states that, &quot;they are using literacies as part of daily sociocultural practices and are laying the foundations on which to build future knowledge and expertise (Henderson, 2008, p. 14).

According to &quot;Wikis and Blogs: Your Keys to Student Collaboration and Engagement,&quot; an article in Today's Classroom Teacher by Catherine Imperatore, Wikis and blogs can strengthen reading and writing skills and teach students about the new literacy of the Internet age. If setup properly, these tools ensure privacy and safety. Reluctant students who do not speak up in class, feel empowered when they use a Wiki or when they Blog. And there is a sense of ownership when students use these tools, because they pay greater attention to detail when their work is published online (Imperatore, 2009, p. 30).

As well, they LOVE technology and are eager to learn how to use new tools. You as a teacher can also learn from your students because for most of us, our students know more than we do when it comes to technology. When it comes to assessing what students are actually learning by using the tools. It is the same way you assess them every other day, expect that you have to be willing to allow the students to be more creative with their final products. A good source of information is: a Rating Scale.There are a wide variety of opinions when it comes to using the “new tools” in the classroom. However, we live in the digital age and we must prepare our students for an even more technology competitive world if we want them to succeed!

[[Image:VertexEdgeRadiant.png|right|frame|''Top:'' A brush with vertex editing activated. &lt;br&gt; ''Bottom:'' The same brush with edge editing activated.]]
Edge editing and vertex editing are two very useful techniques which are used to fine-tune the look of brushes.

'''Edge editing''' lets you select any edge and move it around, while keeping all other edges in place, '''vertex editing''' allows you to do the same, but instead of edges, you can select the vertices (corners) of a brush.

To use edge editing any brush and press '''''E''''' or click [[Image:EdgeButtonRadiant.png|22px]] to switch to edge editing mode. A green dot will appear on every edge of the brush, '''''SHIFT+CLICK''''' any of the green dots to select them, turning them blue. You may select more than one dot at once. Once selected, you can use the [[GtkRadiant/Basic Transformation|basic transforming tools]] to rotate, scale or move the selected dots.

Vertex works exactly the same way, press '''''V''''' or click [[Image:VertexButtonRadiant.png|22px]], but this time, you select the corners of the brushes. All the basic transformation tools will still be available. You can also use vertex editing to edit [[GtkRadiant/Glossary#patchmesh|''patch meshes'']].

''Note: By pressing '''F''' you can enter the face editing mode, which works almost like the two others, but lets you select faces instead of vertices or edges.''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There has been a push to embrace collaborative learning in education. Simultaneously, there is also an increasing demand for the integration of digital technology in education. As a result, the online discussion group has emerged. The online discussion group allows participants to engage in collaborative learning within a digital environment. The idea of group collaboration as a means to construct knowledge has become a widely accepted approach to pedagogy. Drawing on Vygotsky’s social development theory, the online discussion group provides a space for participants to engage in dialogue and develop a dynamic learning community which enhances and enriches understanding of content (Kayler and Weller, 2007). Two major forms have come to typify online discussion: the chat and the forum. The chat is characterized as a synchronous conversation that occurs between multiple participants who are online at the same time, allowing questions and responses to be posted simultaneously. The forum, however, is asynchronous and does not occur in real-time. Therefore, participants are afforded the flexibility and convenience to provide reflective and thoughtful contributions to an online discussion at their leisure (Wall Williams, Watkins, Daley, Courtenay, Davis, Dymock, 2001). The convergence of digital technology and collaborative learning has made the online discussion group increasingly popular in education, but questions have surfaced regarding relevant assessment and evaluation of such student interaction.

Advocates for online discussions have described them as tools that allow for an enriched learning experience that results in a higher order of thinking. In her research, Meyer (2003) observed that students involved in a threaded, asynchronous online discussion tend to exhibit a higher level of thinking that may not be seen in the classroom, particularly when they contribute comments that are exploratory in nature. Meyer (2004) also identifies the value in the written document that is produced in an online discussion that can be referred to and analyzed by both student and teacher at any time for assessment purposes.

Educators engaging their students through online discussion have discovered that successful participation and positive online collaboration must be perceived as a major component of course assessment, and therefore must include the integration of assessment activities (Goodfellow and Lea, 2005). According to researchers Hara, Bonk and Angeli (2000), initial assessment of online discussion emerged through a framework of content analysis established by F. Henri that categorized the learning process evident in electronic messages. The specific criteria identified in Henri’s framework included “student participation, interaction patterns, social cues, cognitive skills and depth of processing, and metacognitive skills and knowledge” (Hara, Bonk, Angeli, 2000, p. 121). Highlighted in this framework is the consideration of general student participation, the social interactions that occur in collaborative learning, as well as the quality and depth of contributions to the discussion, all of which has served as a general foundation for further development of assessment frameworks.

Meyer (2004) compared four different frames of assessment in an effort to determine the most appropriate assessment tools for online discussion.  The study focused on King and Kitchener’s model of reflective judgement that is intended to capture students’ reasoning skills, Perry’s framework of intellectual and ethical development, Garrison’s cognitive-processing model designed for measuring critical thinking, and Bloom’s taxonomy, selected as a familiar method to classify student contributions. Meyer found there was a lack of consistency across frames of assessment, leading her to suggest that each framework measures unique qualities of student learning. She indicated that all four frames had something useful to offer and recommended that using a combination or variety of these frames for assessment purposes would be more beneficial for online forums.

Although her study was directed towards higher education, Meyer stated that, “one can see that the frames could also capture younger students’ thinking among the lower and middle levels of the frameworks. In other words, these four frames may be suitable for a range of student abilities and ages” (Meyer, 2004, p. 111). Since online discussion groups are quickly being applied at all levels of the education spectrum, this may be a very valuable notion for all educators.

In a different study, Holmes (2005) used Biggs and Collis’ SOLO Taxonomy method of assessment for a threaded discussion group. According to Holmes, the SOLO taxonomy is typically used to evaluate the complexity and depth of student learning outcomes. Using the taxonomy, responses in an educational discussion are coded according to how the content relates to assigned tasks. Responses could include social or unrelated content (prestructural), one-dimensional or very simple content (unistructural), several task aspects could be mentioned (multistructural), relevant and coherently integrated content (relational), or task aspects could be reconceptualized to show advanced thinking (extended abstract) (Holmes, 2005).

Holmes (2005) found that the majority of the content in the discussion’s posts were classified relational (30%) or unistructural (27%), indicating an interesting dichotomy between relevant knowledge construction and simple, one-dimensional exchanges. However, a separate study conducted by McLoughlin and Panko (2002) that also used the SOLO taxonomy to assess online discussion suggested that this assessment tool is hierarchical and does not consider the collaborative aspects of knowledge construction in its assessment.

On the surface, it appears that one consistent message has been revealed in this research area: unlike many traditional forms of assessment, there is not one single or best-fitted assessment tool that is recommended for the purpose of evaluating online discussion. Like most other areas of education, it seems to be up to the discretion of the course designer or instructor to select the assessment tool that best suits specific evaluation criteria or skills that online activities are intended to develop (McLoughlin and Panko, 2002). 

According to Goodfellow and Lea (2005), the dilemma with online discussion assessment tools is because the very nature of the technology has allowed for a unique type of literacy to emerge. They argue that although online discussion is predominantly a written collaborative construction, it should be considered a unique genre of writing that reveals different literacy practices to form knowledge and understanding. As such, varied and unique formal assessment must also be developed, posing a significant challenge due to rhetorical complexities arising from this new form of literacy that are not quite understood by student, teacher, or course designers (Goodfellow and Lea, 2005).

As research continues in this area, researchers appear to unite in support of the collaborative qualities provided by online discussion groups and continue to encourage course designers to take careful consideration of this when developing online tasks, making them open-ended, unambiguous and engaging (Holmes, 2005). Although assessment tools continue to be weighed against each other, Hara, Bonk and Angeli (2000) state that every online discussion has the potential to be very unique, and so evaluation criteria may have to be identified on a case-by-case basis.

Technically speaking, models are pre-compiled geometry parts which can be included in a map, if you didn't get that, they are objects, which can be used in your map, this includes stuff like chairs, tables, trees, you get it. These models are supplied with the game you make the maps for, not GtkRadiant itself, so they are different for each game which means you might not recognize any of the models used in the examples.

Models are usually made using modelling software such as ''3ds Max'' or ''Blender'', and for the ''id tech 3'' engine, they usually come in the ''.md3'' format.
Using models, or even making your own can really simplify making your map, or at least visually spicing it up. The next chapters will teach you more about models.</text>

There are two different ways of adding models to your map, the first one involves the ''misc_model'' entity and the second involves the ''misc_model_static'' entity. The difference being that models included in the map using the ''misc_model'' entity are treated as normal brushes by the compiler , and will therefore included in the ''.bsp'' file the compiler creates. Models included using the ''misc_model_static'' are not included within the geometry of the map itself, but rather loaded by the game loading the compiled ''.bsp'' file.

To clarify, if you would make a map with a forest, and you would use, say three different types of trees, resulting in 3 different tree models, now, you would use each of those models twenty times in order to make that forest. If you would be using regular ''misc_model'' entities, each of those three models would get copied twenty times and then placed into the ''.bsp'' by the compiler. This means that if, for simplicity each model would be one MB big, the ''.bsp'' file would end up being 60 MB. However, if ''misc_model_statics'' are to be used, the compiler just stores the points where each model is to be displayed, not the model itself which is instead loaded into memory 60 times by the game engine when playing (loading) the map, but not when compiling it..

Now it would seem that ''misc_model_statics'' are far superior to regular ''misc_models'', however since the ''misc_model_static'' is practically ''invisible'' to the compiler, some useful features can't be used when using ''misc_models''.

Here is a pros and cons list:
*''misc_model''

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[category:Manchu|Lesson 12 - The Manchu Script]]
==History and orgin of the Manchu script==

[[Image:Alphabet mandchou (Encyclopédie).jpg|right|600px]]

The current Manchu script is a Semitic script from the Aramaic group of Semitic scripts and is written vertically from left to right (although it was originally written horizontally from right to left). The script was spread east via Nestorian Christians and was adopted by the Sogdians, then the Uyghurs and the Mongols, before finally being adopted by the Manchus. Prior to Nurhaci's adoption of the current Manchu script, the Jurchens (ancestors of the Manchus) used the Jurchen script to write the Jurchen language (which is in effect the precursor to modern Manchu). The early Jurchen script was invented in 1120 by Wanyan Xiyin, acting on the orders of Wanyan Aguda. It was based on the Khitan script, that was inspired in turn by Chinese characters. However, because Chinese is an isolating language and the Jurchen and Khitan languages are agglutinative, the script proved to be cumbersome. The written Jurchen language died out soon after the fall of the Jin Dynasty, though its spoken form survived until the end of the sixteenth century, when Manchu became the new literary language.


According to the Veritable Records (manju-i yargiyan kooli); (滿洲實錄 Mǎnzhōu Shílù), in 1599 the Manchu leader Nurhaci decided to convert the Mongolian alphabet to make it suitable for the Manchu people. He decried the fact that while illiterate Chinese and Mongolians could understand their respective languages when read aloud, that was not the case for the Manchus, whose documents were recorded by Mongolian scribes. Overriding the objections of two advisors named Erdeni and G'ag'ai, he is credited with adapting the Mongolian script to Manchu. The resulting script was known as 'tongki fuka akū hergen' (script without dots and circles).  


In 1632, Dahai added diacritical marks to clear up a lot of the ambiguity present in the original Mongolian script; for instance, a leading 'k', 'g', and 'h' are distinguished by the placement of no diacritical mark, a dot, and a circle respectively. This revision created the Standard script, known as 'tongki fuka sindaha hergen' (script with dots and circles). As a result, the Manchu alphabet contains little ambiguity. Recently discovered manuscripts from the 1620s make clear, however, that the addition of dots and circles to Manchu script began before their supposed introduction by Dahai.

==How to learn the Manchu script==

There are basically two different ways one can learn the Manchu script:
* Learn it as if it was an alphabet (as is done outside of China)
* Learn each of the syllables separately (there are a lot of them) via the '12 characters'. Most Chinese students of the language learn Manchu this way.

This book will introduce both methods. It is suggested that students first learn the 24 letters for sounds native to Manchu (the 10 letters to transliterate Chinese sounds should be excluded at first) as an alphabet and once they are familiar with these 24 letters they can then work through the '12 character tables' (which are just tables of all the different syllables that can be formed by adding a final to one of the letters) so as to gain greater exposure to the script, and also understand the different rules for writing different syllables. By learning the Manchu script this way, students have the advantage of not being burdened with learning hundreds of syllables when they start learning Manchu, and by just learning the 24 letters they can therefore get a basic grasp of the script very quickly. Students can then move on to the 12 character tables and gain a deep understanding of how the script works without having to spend hours memorising each syllable (the syllables are easy to recognise once you know the 24 letters). Once students are familiar with the 24 letters native to Manchu they can then learn the 10 letters used to write Chinese sounds.  

As mentioned in the introduction to this book, the Manchu script is only taught in lesson 12, as opposed to at the beginning of the book like in most other textbooks. The reason for this is the fact that it is much easier to decipher the script when the student has a basic grasp of the phonetic features of Manchu and a reasonable vocab.

==The 24 letters of the Manchu script==

If we analyse the Manchu script as if it was an alphabet (as opposed to a syllabic script) then the Manchu script has 6 letters to represent the six Manchu vowels, and 18 letters to represent Manchu consonants. As with most other Semetic scripts, each letter of the Manchu script has an independent, an initial, medial and final form.


If we start first with the 6 vowels (See letters 1-6 in the above chart). The characters are 1='a', 2='e', 3='i', 4='o', 5='u', 6='v'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want every selection list in your form to be customized to the context of the situation.  Selection lists need to be dynamically generated by a series of context aware services on the web server.

== Method ==
XForms are powerful because they can load all the codes in a form from a single instance in the model.

This for instance, if you would like to customize what selection lists are displayed to a user based on their role or other property in their session, such as what department or group they are associated with.

== Method ==

This can be done by using session variables stored on the server.  You can alternatively store the user in a cookie on the client and then use this information to look up the correct information.

Assume you have an XML file that associates a user with their roles:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Users&gt;
   &lt;User&gt;
      &lt;LoginID&gt;jdoe&lt;/LoginID&gt;
      &lt;Roles&gt;
          &lt;Role&gt;project-manager&lt;/Role&gt;
          &lt;Role&gt;glossary-code-table-admin&lt;/Role&gt;
      &lt;/Roles&gt;
   &lt;/User&gt;
   &lt;User&gt;
      ...
&lt;/Users&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

These roles can be in a session variable (see session) or you can have a function that looks up the role from the LoginID.

When the forms load, a script can be executed that loads all the code tables into an instance in the model:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:model&gt;
   &lt;xf:instanace src=&quot;all-codes.xq?LoginID=jdoe&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/xf:model&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Online communities offer many opportunities for students and educators to connect with each other to expand their knowledge and receive instantaneous feedback, critique, and moral support about ideas, research, curriculum, and education. Much debate revolves around when a particular learning community began or if in fact a community has been established in the virtual world. As well, the research on the effects and benefits of online communities is mixed. Despite this, online communities are in extensive use and will challenge educators to rethink how they assess and evaluate their students given the number of online communities created by students. These online communities being created to allow for students to work on assignments together which much more ease and speed instead of meeting of meeting face to face. Complicating the debate surrounding criteria for the establishment and existence of online communities is the differences between learning communities and communities of practice (CoPs). 

Online learning communities require access to technology and the ability to use it effectively, it requires membership, shared goals, shared purposes, the ability to retain and project identity, shared knowledge, member participation or contributions, and trust. Stuckey, Hedberg, &amp; Lockyer (2002) argue that “some may confuse an online portal, database, network, listserv, or interest group for a learning community In contrast to learning communities, Stuckey et al. contend that learning portals and hubs have varied members, limited connections between members, and a mentality of users as consumers of information not generators or contributors of knowledge (i.e., they are passive users).” Online communities are interactive, where sharing of knowledge among community members takes place and where knowledge is created, consumed, shared, and expanded.

According to Wenger et al. (2002), a community of practice “describes a group of people, who form relationships that are essentially focused on shared objectives, concerns, interests, ideas, or a common set of problems related to a practice, domain, or topic. Members of a CoP are part of a social network that share a fervent concern about a topic or idea and who deepen their knowledge of this topic by continuing to interact about it. As a social network, a CoP lives for and through the relationships and the ties that connect people to one another.”

An online CoP is similar to an online community in that there is a need for trust, mutual understanding, respect, cooperation, and the development of knowledge. What distinguishes an online CoP from an online community is that in the CoP there is a passion for innovation and knowledge creation towards developing a more solid practice. There is a shared vision and an ongoing effort for improving practices through participation in an online CoP. Members will usually continue to meet face-to-face when possible in a CoP whereas in an online learning community members are (for the most part) are unknown to each other and there is a weak responsibility by individuals to the community. According to Hung and Nichani (2002) “CoPs are characterized by tight-knit groups of people who know each other well. They have been working together for some time, and they are bound together by their shared practice and identity”.

Although online CoPs are increasing in number, educators are still hesitant to enter into CoPs for a number of reasons:
•	Culture of Sharing and Trust – some people do not share information very well and lack trust in the technology (medium). 
•	Values of Teaching &amp; Learning – some teachers isolate themselves and do not contribute to the building of their profession. Others are reluctant to continue to learn.
•	Subject Area Limitations – people do not feel they can contribute because of limited knowledge (joining a community of practice concerning a subject they do not feel comfortable with). 
•	Time – lack of time to participate online
•	Copyright Fears – fear that their work will be scrutinized and vulnerable for others to use or copy.
•	Quality Concerns – distrust in others contributions or the quality and safe use of technology
•	ICT skills – lacking skills (older generation)
•	Limitations and availability of technology (and costs!) – Technology may not be available or within cost expectations.

Wenger (1998) detailed five specific stages of community development. Initially there is a stage where people see the potential of working together and sharing ideas after finding each other’s communalities and joint interests (i.e., “Potential Phase”). Next, these interests may coalesce into a more formalized CoP with a purpose, membership, and schedule (i.e., “Coalescing Phase”). In the third stage, the identity of the CoP is more firmly established, relationships are built and maintained among members, experiences are documented, trust and commitment emerge, and new members are initiated (i.e., “Active Phase I”). Near the end of this stage, relationships and connections are more explicitly pursued outside the CoP as members interact with other practices within the company or other companies (i.e., “Active Phase II”). Fourth, member engagement in that CoP is no longer as intense and some activities dissipate or are closed out and perhaps archived (i.e., “Dispersed Phase”). Finally, when the community ceases to exist, there are some people who attempt to preserve and remember it through stories and rituals (i.e., “Memorable Phase”). In order for a CoP to be successful, members need to maintain trust, identity, and interaction between members which allows the CoP to remain somewhere in the third stage. CoPs require members to develop strong lasting ties and individually feel a strong responsibility to the success and continuance of the community. 

When a CoP is functioning well (in the “Active Phase”) a number of interactions increase and in many cases the CoP forms links with other CoPs and professionals. In phase three a number of activities are taking place according to Wenger
•	Problem solving and knowledge creation
•	Seeking members with similar experiences or expertise 
•	Reusing or discussing assets 
•	Coordination of projects 
•	Mapping knowledge and identifying gaps
•	Discussing new and ongoing developments 
•	Documentation and archiving of projects 
•	Negotiation of ideas
•	Encouraging innovation and evaluation of practices

In order for an online community of practice to be successful, the technology supporting it needs to meet the needs of the community (and support it’s identity) as well as the needs of the individual (and support their identity). Wenger (2001) outlines that a technology steward is a good prerequisite for a successful online CoP. The technology steward role requires understanding of the relevant technologies for communities, the inventiveness of the technology for serving the community perspective, and supporting the way the community uses technology and ideas about the technology which come from inside the community. Once the technology to support the CoP is in place, Wenger states that ongoing monitoring by the technology steward is essential to ensure for ease of use and learning, to search for possible opportunities for evolution of the technology, and to ensure ease of use for participants from the user’s perspective.  

Examples of technologies, both synchronous and asynchronous, that have been developed for online communities include Communispace (http://www.communispace.com/),   CommunityZero (http://www.ramius.net/products/communityzero/index.cfm), iCohere (http://www.icohere.com/), and Web Crossing (http://www.webcrossing.com/Home/).

Other technologies  which have been adapted for Cop and not specifically designed for CoPs include eRoom, Groove, Quickplace, Blackboard, Moodle, WebCity, Livelink, Meetme, Mindshare, SharePoint, or WebSphere, PhP Nuke, Plone, Vignette, WebEx, PlaceWare, HorizonLive, and NetMeeting. MSN Messenger, Usenet, and Yahoo Groups are also used.

      <comment>Fixed/changed &quot;mandatory first argument&quot; to &quot;name of last function argument&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==== va_arg ====

{{C++ Programming/Syntax|
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;cstdarg&gt;
type va_arg( va_list argptr, type );
void va_end( va_list argptr );
void va_start( va_list argptr, last_parm );
&lt;/source&gt;
}}

The va_arg() macros are used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.

#First, you must have a call to va_start() passing a valid '''va_list''' and the name of the last argument variable before the ellipsis (&quot;...&quot;). This first argument can be anything; one way to use it is to have it be an integer describing the number of parameters being passed.
#Next, you call va_arg() passing the '''va_list''' and the type of the argument to be returned. The return value of va_arg() is the current parameter.
#Repeat calls to va_arg() for however many arguments you have.
#Finally, a call to va_end() passing the '''va_list''' is necessary for proper cleanup.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int sum( int num, ... ) {
  int answer = 0;
  va_list argptr;            

  va_start( argptr, num );            

  for( ; num &gt; 0; num-- ) {
    answer += va_arg( argptr, int );
  }           

  va_end( argptr );           

  return( answer );
}             
                

int main( void ) {            

  int answer = sum( 4, 4, 3, 2, 1 );
  printf( &quot;The answer is %d\n&quot;, answer );           

  return( 0 );
}  
&lt;/source&gt;

This code displays 10, which is 4+3+2+1.

Here is another example of variable argument function, which is a simple printing function:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void my_printf( char *format, ... ) {
  va_list argptr;             

  va_start( argptr, format );          

  while( *format != '\0' ) {
    // string
    if( *format == 's' ) {
      char* s = va_arg( argptr, char * );
      printf( &quot;Printing a string: %s\n&quot;, s );
    }
    // character
    else if( *format == 'c' ) {
      char c = (char) va_arg( argptr, int );
      printf( &quot;Printing a character: %c\n&quot;, c );
      break;
    }
    // integer
    else if( *format == 'd' ) {
      int d = va_arg( argptr, int );
      printf( &quot;Printing an integer: %d\n&quot;, d );
    }          

    *format++;
  }            

  va_end( argptr );
}              
                

int main( void ) {             

  my_printf( &quot;sdc&quot;, &quot;This is a string&quot;, 29, 'X' );         

  return( 0 );
} 
&lt;/source&gt;

This code displays the following output when run:

 Printing a string: This is a string
 Printing an integer: 29
 Printing a character: X

==About this book==
'''Hoş geldiňiz''' ([[w:IPA|IPA]]: [hoʃ geldiŋið]), or welcome, to the Turkmen Wikibook, perhaps the only learning resource available which can teach you the [[:w:Turkmen language|Turkmen language]] for free! Besides, isn't that what the ''wiki'' philosophy is all about, as well as letting others edit these free resources?! Speaking of the latter, anyone can freely contribute to this growing Wikibook (Turkmen: ''Wikikitap''), so if you would like to add extra content&lt;ref&gt;In this context, &quot;adding extra content&quot; refers to adding extra content to a particular existing page. If you would like to start a new page, please consult [[User:Runningfridgesrule]], the creator of this Wikibook, before doing so. If he finds that you've added crap to his book, he certainly won't be pleased...&lt;/ref&gt; or correct any errors, feel free to do so by clicking on the ''edit'' button at the top of the page. It's that simple!

===Characteristics of this book===
This book is written in [[w:British English|British English]], so all the usual rules apply, for example: ''colour'', not ''color''; ''holiday'', not ''vacation'', etc.. It is assumed that those who don't speak British English shouldn't have a problem with this and should be able to understand British English.

The Turkmen in this book is in the Latin script rather than the now-defunt Cyrillic alphabet. However, despite the fact that the Cyrillic alphabet is no longer used to write Turkmen, for those interested, the [[Turkmen/Alphabet|Alphabet]] page of this book will touch on it. There can also sometimes be variances in the letters used in Turkmen to denote a particular sound, for example Ňň as opposed to Ññ, or Ýý as opposed to Ÿÿ. In this Wikibook, the letters '''Ňň''' and '''Ýý''' shall be used.

===The Turkmen language===
:''See also'': [[w:Turkmen language|Wikipedia:Turkmen language]]
The Turkmen language is one of the many [[:w:Turkic languages|Turkic languages]] spoken in [[:w:Eurasia|Eurasia]], thus being similar, at differing levels, to languages such as [[Azerbaijani]], [[Turkish]] and [[Uzbek]], among other Turkic languages. It is spoken by approximately 9 million people worldwide; it is spoken by 3,430,000 people in [[:w:Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]], and by approximately an additional 5,500,000 people in other countries, including [[w:Iran|Iran]] (2,000,000), [[w:Iraq|Iraq]] (1,500,000), [[w:Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] (500,000), and [[w:Turkey|Turkey]] (1,000,000).

Although knowing another Turkic language is an advantage to learning Turkmen, this book assumes no prior knowledge of any Turkic language at all, so don't worry. In some ways Turkmen is an easy language to learn. Unlike Russian or Spanish, Turkmen has no genders. There are no irregular verbs. For the most part, words are written exactly as they are pronounced. Finally, Turkmen's grammatical case system is remarkably simple once understood, and has almost no exceptions.

The greatest difficulty for beginning Turkmen speakers will probably be adapting to Turkmen's elaborate system of grammatical suffixes, or &quot;tag words&quot; and learning to re-order their speech so that the predicate (verb) is the last thing spoken. Also, many simple English grammatical structures (such as &quot;to have&quot;, &quot;to need&quot;, or &quot;to be able to&quot;) are handled differently in Turkmen.

==About==
{{Wikipedia|Turkmen alphabet}}
The Turkmen alphabet was first written in a modified form of the [[w:Arabic alphabet|Arabic alphabet]], until about 1930, when a Latin script was introducted. The Latin script was replaced in 1940 when all Turkic people in the Soviet Union were required to adopt the Cyrillic script. Finally, in 1995, the '''''Täze Elipbiýi''''' or New Alphabet, was formally introduced by former president [[:w:Saparmurat Niyazov|Saparmurat Nyýazow]] to re-align Turkmenistan with the non-Soviet world. (Similar new alphabets have been introduced in Uzbekiztan and other republics.)

The New Alphabet is currently used for street signs and political slogans, but there is a severe deficit of other reading materials. Almost all Turkmen books in print use the Cyrillic alphabet, and despite the national-wide trainings that have taken place, and televised instructional programs, the New Alphabet has yet to gain popular acceptance. Nevertheless, the Latin alphabet is the official writing system of Turkmenistan, and for this reason, as well as the fact that the Latin alphabet seems better suited to the Turkmen language, this book will be teaching you Turkmen in the Latin alphabet. Having said that, though, for those interested, this page will also be showing the Cyrillic alphabet, too. It would certainly be worth taking a look at the [[#Comparison table|comparison table]] at the bottom of the page, where sound clips of certain letters can also be found.

===Latin alphabet===
The thirty letters of the Latin Turkmen alphabet are as follows:
{| cellpadding=4 style=&quot;font-size:large; text-align:center;&quot; summary=&quot;Turkmen in the Latin script, all 30 letters, capital and lowercase&quot; align=center

==Vowel harmony==
&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;#006666&quot;&gt;ÇEKIMLI SES&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#CC0000&quot;&gt;YLALYMY&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
'''&lt;font color=&quot;#006666&quot;&gt;Vowel&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#CC0000&quot;&gt;harmony&lt;/font&gt;'''

One very interesting feature of Turkmen is that all vowels can be divided into two groups, the '''front vowels''' (''inçe çekimli sesler'') and the '''back vowels''' (''ýogyn çekimli sesler''). Front vowels are pronounced higher in the throat and are more nasal, while back vowels are pronounced lower in the throat and are more guttural. The front vowels are ä, e, i, ö, and ü. The back vowels are a, y, o, and u. The &quot;harmony&quot; lies in the fact that all Turkmen words of Turkic origin are pronounced either entirely with front vowels, like ''kädi'' (pumpkin) or ''köwüş'' (shoe), or with back vowels, like ''doganlyk'' (brotherhood) or ''mugallym'' (teacher). Grammatical and verb suffixes also follow vowel harmony, being divided into two groups for front-vowel words and back-vowel words. For example, the front-vowel plural suffix ''-ler'' would be added to kädi to form the word for &quot;pumpkins,&quot; whereas the back-vowel plural suffix -lar would be added to mugallym to produce &quot;teachers.&quot; In short, front vowels go with front vowels and back vowels with back. Subsequent suffix appendices will more completely explain applications of this rule.

Turkmen has many Russian words, such as ''telewizor'' (television) and ''radio'' (radio), that have simply been incorporated into the language. These are spelled exactly according to the original Russian and often have both front and back vowels within one word. Such is true for the numerous Turkmen words of Persian and Arabic origin, such as ''kitap'' (book), ''dükan'' (shop), and ''serdar'' (leader). In these cases, consistent with the general rule for vowel harmony in Turkmen, the final vowel of the word determines the vowel harmony for suffixation.

{{Wikipedia|Vowel harmony}}
Verbs in Turkmen adhere consistently to vowel harmony. All verbs belong to one of two groups determined by their infinitive forms: those ending in ''-mak'', and those ending in ''-mek''. The suffixes for all ''-mak'' verbs have only back vowels, whereas only front vowels will be found in the suffixes of ''-mek'' verbs. Examples of this will follow in the explanations of verb tenses.

==Conclusion==
Obviously everything covered in this page is extremely important and without it you can't learn Turkmen properly, so if you didn't get anything, it might be worth reading the page, again, just like you would with a normal book. If you feel that you understand everything, look at the following checklist and check whether you can check all of the points:
===Checklist===
*I know the Latin Turkmen alphabet off by heart, in the right order.
*''(Optional)'' I know the Cyrillic Turkmen alphabet off by heart, in the right order.
*I understand the concept of vowel harmony.

'''It is definitely worth doing [[/Exercise|this exercise]], too, just to reinforce the information that you've just learned.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==World War I==
Before one can understand why World War II happened, they must first understand why World War I happened. 
[[Image:WWIchartX.svg|thumb|250|The Alliances prior to WWI.]]
===Prelude===
On June 28th, 1914, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary was assassinated by Serbian terrorists. Austria quickly deemed Serbia responsible and demanded retaliation. At this time, Europe was a tangle of secret alliances between major powers. France and Russia supported Serbia while Germany supported Austria-Hungary. On July 23, 1914, an ultimatum was sent to Serbia with ten demands, some so extreme that the Serbian reply included reservations and rejected the sixth demand. The Serbians, relying on support from Russia, removed acceptance of the sixth key demand (the draft reply had accepted it), and also ordered mobilization.  In response to this, Austria-Hungary issued a declaration of war on July 28. Russia began to mobilize, and after denying a German request to stop, Germany declared war on Russia. Germany was sure that France would come to the support of Russia, so they also declared war on France. 

Initially, Britain remained neutral but when German invaded Belgium in order to execute the  Schlieffen Plan, Britain was drawn into the war.
===Central Powered Succes===
The war on the Western Front drew into a stalemate, as both sides dug trenches through Western France and suffered heavy casualties only to advance a few miles and be pushed back. On the Eastern Front, a seesaw war ensued, with both sides attacking, advancing then retreating. In 1915 Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire came onto the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary, collectively known as the Central Powers. Italy joined the Allied side in 1915, with the promise of territorial expansion. In 1915, Bulgaria and Austria-Hungary conquered Serbia and Montenegro. They pushed to the Greek border. Several attempts by the Ottoman Empire to seize the Suez Canal from the British failed, and an Ottoman offensive into Russia proved to be a catastrophy. The greatest allies success came in the German colonies, which were seized by the Japanese and the British.
[[Image:Australian infantry small box respirators Ypres 1917.jpg|thumb|250px|Australian troops in a trench wearing Gasmasks.]]
===Turning the Tide===
In 1917 Russia was forced out of the war after the Tsar was overthrown. However, the United States entered the war on the side of the allies. Germany realised that its only chance to win the war was to push to Paris before American troops arrived. After initial success, the offensive stalled and when American troops began to arrive, Germany suffered major defeats. Germany's allies began to collapse as well. After an Allied breakthrough in Macedonia, Bulgaria surrendered on  September 29, 1918. After the fall of Baghdad and Jerusalem, the Ottomans surrenderd on October 30. An Italian breakthrough into Austria-Hungary resulted in their surrender on November 4. Germany agreed to a cease-fire on November 11.

==The Treaty==
Negotiations between the Allied powers started on January 18 in the Salle de l'Horloge at the French Foreign Ministry, on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Initially, 70 delegates of 26 nations participated in the negotiations. Having been defeated, Germany, Austria, and Hungary were excluded from the negotiations. Russia was also excluded because it had negotiated a separate peace with Germany in 1917, in which Germany gained a large fraction of Russia's land and resources.

===French Aims===
France had lost some 1.5 million military personnel and an estimated 400,000 civilians to the war, and much of the western front had been fought on French soil. To appease the French public, Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau wanted to impose policies deliberately meant to cripple Germany militarily, politically, and economically so as never to be able to invade France again.

===British Aims===
Prime Minister David Lloyd George supported reparations but to a lesser extent than the French. Lloyd George was aware that if the demands made by France were carried out, France could become the most powerful force on the continent, and a delicate balance could be unsettled. Lloyd George was also worried by Woodrow Wilson's proposal for &quot;self-determination&quot; and, like the French, wanted to preserve his own nation's empire. Like the French, Lloyd George also supported secret treaties and naval blockades.[[Image:Council of Four Versailles.jpg|thumb|250px|The big four. Lloyd George, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, Georges Clemenceau, President Woodrow Wilson.]]

===American Aims===
The United States took a more conciliatory view toward the issue of German reparations. American Leaders wanted to ensure the success of future trading opportunities and favourably collect on the European debt, and hoped to avoid future wars. Before the end of the war, President Woodrow Wilson, along with other American officials including Edward Mandell House, put forward his Fourteen Points which he presented in a speech at the Paris Peace Conference.

===Results===
The treaty was signed on June 28, 1919. It said that Germany was solely responsible for the war, and the size of the military was greatly reduced. Germany was not allowed to have an airforce. 

Germany was compelled to yield control of its colonies, and would also lose a number of European territories. Most notably, the province of West Prussia would be ceded to the newly independent Second Polish Republic, thereby granting Poland access to the Baltic Sea via the &quot;Polish Corridor&quot;, and turning East Prussia into an exclave, separated from mainland Germany.

{{legend|#ddefd0|Administered by the League of Nations}}
{{legend|#ffffcf|Annexed by neighbouring countries}}
{{legend|#f6d3a9|Weimar Republic}}]]
In Europe, Germany lost Alsace-Lorraine to France, Northern Schleswig to Denmark, the Prussian provinces of Posen and of West Prussia to Poland and a small amount of territory to Belgium. In addition, the Province of Saar would be under control of the League of Nations for 15 years, and the Rhineland demilitarized. The total sum of war reparations demanded from Germany—226 billion Reichsmarks in gold (around £11.3 billion)—was decided by an Inter-Allied Reparations Commission. In 1921, it was reduced to 132 billion Reichsmarks (£4,990 million).

In Chapter X of CME, SPT states that 
the derivative (at a given point)
can be viewed as the slope of the tangent to a curve (at that point).
Let's use our software to examine slopes.

Consider parabolas of the form:

    &lt;math&gt; y = (x - h)^2 + v &lt;/math&gt;

The ''h'' variable induces a rightward shift of the parabola
if ''h'' is positive and a leftward shift if ''h'' is negative.
The ''v'' variable induces an upward shift
if  positive and a downward shift if negative.
Thus, these curves 
bottom out at the point &lt;math&gt;(h,v)&lt;/math&gt;.
For &lt;math&gt;h = 3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v = 1&lt;/math&gt;,
we get:

    &lt;math&gt; y = (x - 3)^2 + 1 &lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math&gt; y = (x - 3)(x -3) + 1 &lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math&gt; y = x^2 - 3x - 3x + 9 + 1 &lt;/math&gt;
    &lt;math&gt; y = x^2 - 6x + 10 &lt;/math&gt;
    
Plotting the parabola yields:

[[File:ch10-figure01.png|center]]

We can see from the plot that when &lt;math&gt;x = 3&lt;/math&gt;,
the curve bottoms out and the tangent at the point should
be horizontal, having a slope of
zero. To the right of that point, the slope rises to
the left, so the derivative in that area should be
positive. To the left of the bottom point, the slope
rises to the left, so the derivative in that area
should be negative.

To confirm our intuition, we shall encode the parabola
as a sum of terms:

    var y = term(1,:x,2) minus term(6,:x,1) plus term(10,:x,0);

and take the derivative:

    var y' = y . diff(:x);

Let's look at ''y'' and its derivative at &lt;math&gt;x = 2,3,4&lt;/math&gt;:

    sway&gt; y . value(2)
    INTEGER: 2
    sway&gt; y . value(3)
    INTEGER: 1
    sway&gt; y . value(4)
    INTEGER: 2

    sway&gt; y' . value(2)
    INTEGER: -2
    sway&gt; y' . value(3)
    INTEGER: 0
    sway&gt; y' . value(4)
    INTEGER: 2

Just as we suspected.

==Solving problems==

Let's take a break from programming and use the software
we've been given to solve some problems given in CME.

According to CME, To find a minima or maxima
of a curve with independent variable ''x'',
you take the derivative,
set the derivative to zero, and then solve
for ''x''. At that point, the slope of the original
is zero and therefore must be the highest point
on the peak or the lowest point in a valley.
As CME states, you don't know for sure if
the zero slope represents a peak or if it
represents a valley, but it must be one or the 
other.

The process for solving for ''x'' is much like the process
for simplifying an expression; it is a complex task beyond
the scope of this text. So we will not be able to
find minima/maxima symbolically. 
However, thanks to Sir Isaac Newton, we will be able to
perform this task numerically.

For the rest of this chapter, we will dispense with our
object approach and take a functional approach, as the
whole purpose for using objects was to perform symbolic
tasks. Adapting our previous object approach to perform
numeric tasks such as finding minima/maxima is left as
an exercise.

==A Blast from the Past==

To begin, we must learn how to represent polynomials and their
derivatives as numeric Sway functions.
Remember our ''ratio'' function from Chapters 3 and 4? We used
it to compute &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; numerically:

    function ratio(x,dx,y)
        {
        var dy = y(x + dx) - y(x);
        dy / dx;
        }

In Sway, not only are we allowed to return numbers, strings
and environments (objects) from functions,
we can also return functions themselves. We will use
this fact to build numeric derivative functions.

----
At this point, you should read about
[[../Reference/ReturningLocalFunctions|returning local functions]]
in the Sway Reference Manual.
----

So rather than use the ratio function which requires us to
pass in the same ''y'' function over and over,
we will define a function to return a customized ''ratio'' that
takes only the ''x'' value as an argument.
Looking at the code will help 
immensely:

    function derivative(y,dx)
        {
        function ratio(x)
            {
            var dy = y(x + dx) - y(x);
            dy / dx;
            }
        }

Since the last expression in the ''derivative'' function
is the definition of ''ratio'', it is the ''ratio'' function that
is the return value for ''derivative''.
Now, we can pass and ''x'' value to both the original function and
its derivative.

As always, let's test, using this polynomial as a guinea pig:

    &lt;math&gt; 3 x ^ 2 - 10 x + 5 &lt;/math&gt;

Representing this polynomial numerically as a Sway function, we have:

    function y(x)
        {
        3 * (x ^ 2) - (10 * x) + 5;
        }
      
    var y' = derivative(y,0.000001);

We would expect the symbolic derivative of ''y'' to be:

    &lt;math&gt; 6 x - 10 &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
we would expect &lt;tt&gt;y(2)&lt;/tt&gt; to yield -3 and
&lt;tt&gt;y'(2)&lt;/tt&gt; to yield 2.

    sway&gt; y(2);
    INTEGER: -3
    sway&gt; y'(2);
    REAL_NUMBER: 2.0000029988

The imprecision in the second result is again due to working
with real numbers rather than integers.&lt;ref&gt;
We could try to increase the precision by using a smaller
value for ''dx''. However, we run the risk of outstripping
the native precision of Sway's real numbers which carry a 
limited number of significant digits. Someday, Sway may have
''infinite precision'' integers and reals,
like a good language should.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==A good fixation==

A necessary next step in finding minima/maxima numerically is to
be able to find a ''fixed point'' of a function. If a function
has a fixed point (and not all functions do), then there is
a value ''x'' such that:

    &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x&lt;/math&gt;

For example, the cosine function has a fixed point near
0.7390851332:

    sway&gt; cos(0.7390851332);
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.7390851332

I say ''near'' because Sway does not show all the significant
digits, by default.

Finding a fixed point is algorithmically simple:

    function fixedPoint(f,x)
        {
        if (f(x) == x)
            {
            x;
            }
        else
            {
            fixedPoint(f,x + f(x) / 2);
            }
        }

If, for the given ''x'', &lt;math&gt;f(x) != x&lt;/math&gt;, we
try again with a new value of ''x''. Conveniently,
the average of ''x'' and &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a mathematically
sound value for our next try.

Although this code illustrates the approach well, there are
a few things wrong with it. The first problem is that f(x)
is calculated twice. For efficiency's sake, we should
calculate it once:

    function fixedPoint(f,x)
        {
        var next = f(x);
        if (next == x)
            {
            x;
            }
        else
            {
            fixedPoint(f,x + next / 2);
            }
        }

The next problem is due to the limited precision of
real numbers in Sway. Because real numbers cannot be
represented exactly, it is usually unwise to make
equality comparisons between real numbers at the
extremes of their precision. Therefore, unless you
know better
(and in the case of fixedPoint, you ''don't'' know better),
you should check instead if the numbers are within some
small amount:

    var FIXED_POINT_DELTA = 1e-10;

    function fixedPoint(f,x)
        {
        var next = f(x);
        if (abs(x - next) &lt; FIXED_POINT_DELTA)
            {
            x;
            }
        else
            {
            fixedPoint(f,x + next / 2);
            }
        }

The ''abs'' (absolute value) function is used since &lt;tt&gt;x - next&lt;/tt&gt;
might be a large negative value, which would also be less than
&lt;math&gt;1 * 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;
Note the attempt to avoid hard-wiring a number like 1e-10 in the
body of ''fixedPoint''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

We need an initial value for ''x'' when we call ''fixedPoint''.
It turns out that 1.0 is almost always a good guess, so let's
hard-wire it. Here is a neat trick for doing that:

    function fixedPoint(f)
        {
        function helper(f,x)
            {
            var next = f(x);
            if (abs(x - next) &lt; FIXED_POINT_DELTA)
                {
                x;
                }
            else
                {
                helper(f,x + next / 2);
                }
            }
        helper(f,1.0);
        }

The essence of the trick is to rename your function for which
you wish to fix some arguments to a nice name like ''helper''.&lt;ref&gt;
Remember to rename the recursive calls, as well. Forgetting to
do so is the most common error in performing this transformation.
&lt;/ref&gt;
You then wrap that function with a function having the original
name, making ''helper'' a local function. Then the last thing
you do in the wrapper function is call the helper, fixing the
values of the desired argument. 

We can improve this latest version by noting that ''fixedPoint'''s
formal parameter ''f'' is bound to the same value
as ''helper'''s formal parameter ''f'', so we can remove
''helper'''s version in both the definition and call:

    function fixedPoint(f)
        {
        function helper(x)
            {
            var next = f(x);
            if (abs(x - next) &lt; FIXED_POINT_DELTA)
                {
                x;
                }
            else
                {
                helper(x + next / 2);
                }
            }
        helper(1.0);
        }

Don't forget to change the recursive calls as well.

==Newton's Transformer==

Newton came up with a clever way to find out where a polynomials
(and other differentiable functions) have a value of zero. He
said that a zero of some function ''f'' is also a fixed point
of a new function derived from ''f''.
This new function,
&lt;math&gt;f_{NT}&lt;/math&gt;, is:

    &lt;math&gt;f_{NT}(x) = x - \frac{f(x)}{f\,'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, to find a zero of some function, we generate
a new function using Newton's Transform and pass
the transformed function to our fixed point finder.
The value it returns is our zero!

First, let's implement Newton's Transform:

    function NewtonsTransform(f)
        {
        var f' = derivative(f,0.000001);
        function y(x)
            {
            x - (f(x) / f'(x));
            }
        }

Now let's test our polynomial:

    &lt;math&gt; y = 3 x ^ 2 - 10 x + 5 &lt;/math&gt;

We implement it using a Sway function, as before, and
create the derivative function:

    function y(x)
        {
        3 * (x ^ 2) - (10 * x) + 5;
        }
      
    var y' = derivative(y,0.000001);

Where does function ''y'' produce a zero?

    sway&gt; fixedPoint(NewtonsTransform(y));
    REAL_NUMBER: 0.6125741133
    sway&gt; y(0.6125741133);
    REAL_NUMBER: -1.441567e-10

Given our inherent imprecision, 0.6125741133 does seem to be near
a zero for ''y''.
How about ''y'''?

==Before you decide to put this book down and have a cuppa...==
In addition to everything you've learned this lesson, it is also imperative that you learn the vocab in the &quot;Vowel harmony&quot; section of this test, as it WILL come up later on in another exercise, so write all the words down and learn them. '''You have been warned...'''

'''&lt;font color=&quot;#CC0000&quot;&gt;What is&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#006666&quot;&gt;your name?&lt;/font&gt;'''

'''&lt;big&gt;S&lt;/big&gt;alam''', or hello, and welcome to your first official class! OK, so I bet that now you really want to learn Turkmen, right? Well then, let's start off with our names!

Throughout this lesson we will be analysing part of a conversation between a Turkmen man called '''Murat''' and a Turkmen woman called '''Bahargül'''. Let's begin...

==Siziň adyňyz näme?==
&quot;''Siziň adyňyz näme?''&quot; or &quot;What is your name?&quot; is, for obvious reasons, a very important phrase to learn. The phrase literally translates word-by-word as ''Your name what?''. The word ''näme'' simply means &quot;what&quot;, and like other Turkmen question words, it always goes to the end of the sentence.

Read the conversation between Murat and Bahargül below:

:'''''Murat:''' Salam!''&lt;br/&gt;
:'''''Bahargül:''' Salam.''&lt;br/&gt;
:'''''Murat:''' Siziň adyňyz näme?''&lt;br/&gt;
:'''''Bahargül:''' Meniň adym Bahargül. Siziň adyňyz näme?''&lt;br/&gt;
:'''''Murat:''' Meniň adym Murat.''&lt;br/&gt;

Although there might not be words in there that you understand, it should be pretty obvious what each sentence means, considering that you already know how to say ''salam'' and ''siziň adyňyz näme?'', and that you know their names, too. Before you can read the translation for this conversation, first let's look at some important grammatical points.
===Cases===
Like Russian or German, Turkic languages have a system of '''grammatical cases'''. Cases are defined by changes that occur to a word when it is placed in different grammatical context. English has cases for personal pronouns. For example: &quot;I see him&quot;, &quot;He sees me&quot;. Not &quot;Me sees he&quot;, &quot;Him sees I&quot;. Turkmen, however, has six cases, and these cases are used for all words, not just personal pronouns. The six Turkmen cases are: the nominative, used for the subject of the sentence; the genitive, similar to English possessives; the dative, used to show directed action; the accusative, which is similar to the English &quot;direct object&quot;; the locative, which shows locality; and the instrumental, which is used to show origin.

While six cases might seem a bit overwhelming at first, it should be noted that the case suffixes simply replace our English prepositions such as &quot;from,&quot; &quot;at,&quot; &quot;with,&quot; &quot;in,&quot; &quot;on,&quot; and &quot;to&quot;. Also, the rules for their use are remarkably simple and inflexible, unlike those of the Russian cases.

In the case of the conversation that we were looking at, cases were used with personal pronouns (e.g. ''Siziň''). These follow fairly straightforwardly from the regular case endings. For now, though, we will only be learning the nominative and genitive cases. As you can see, its all fairly straightforward, except for '''ol''' which changes to '''on-''' in every non-nominative case. To make a pronoun genitive, simply add '''-iň''' or '''-yň''', depending on the pronoun's vowel harmony.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=center
|-
!Case
!I
!you (singular informal)
!he/she/it
!we
!you (plural or formal)
!they
|-
|'''Nominative'''
|men
|sen
|ol
|biz
|siz
|olar
|-
|'''Genitive'''
|men&lt;u&gt;iň&lt;/u&gt; ''(my)''
|sen&lt;u&gt;iň&lt;/u&gt; ''(your)''
|on&lt;u&gt;yň&lt;/u&gt; ''(his/her/it's)''
|biz&lt;u&gt;iň&lt;/u&gt; ''(our)''
|siz&lt;u&gt;iň&lt;/u&gt; ''(your)''
|olar&lt;u&gt;yň&lt;/u&gt; ''(their)''
|-
|}

That's all fairly easy, but you still can't say ''My name is'' in Turkmen if you only know how to make a pronoun genitive. Unlike English, the Turkmen language also adds a suffix to the object of possession. This may at times be redundant ('''Meniň kaka&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt; geldi.''' = My father-(my) came.) but often the possessive participle is omitted ('''Kaka&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt; geldi.''' = Father-(my) came.) so the suffix alone shows possession, for example, ''adym Murat'' alone still means ''My name is Murat'', even without using ''meniň''.

The suffix added to a noun depends on it's vowel harmony, so using the words ''kaka'' (father), ''eje'' (mother), ''at'' (name) and ''it'' (dog), let's look at the suffixes which need to be added:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=center
|-
!Vowel ending

|My&lt;br/&gt;'''-m'''&lt;br/&gt;kaka&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt; - my father&lt;br/&gt;eje&lt;u&gt;m&lt;/u&gt; - my mother
|My&lt;br/&gt;'''-ym''', '''-im''' ('''-um''', '''-üm''')&lt;br/&gt;ad&lt;u&gt;ym&lt;/u&gt; - my name&lt;br/&gt;it&lt;u&gt;im&lt;/u&gt; - my dog
|Our&lt;br/&gt;'''-myz''', '''-miz'''&lt;br/&gt;kaka&lt;u&gt;myz&lt;/u&gt; - our father&lt;br/&gt;eje&lt;u&gt;miz&lt;/u&gt; - our mother
|Our&lt;br/&gt;'''-ymyz''', '''-imiz''' ('''-umyz''', '''-ümiz''')&lt;br/&gt;ad&lt;u&gt;ymyz&lt;/u&gt; - our name&lt;br/&gt;it&lt;u&gt;imiz&lt;/u&gt; - our dog
|-
|Your (sing., informal)&lt;br/&gt;'''-ň'''&lt;br/&gt;kaka&lt;u&gt;ň&lt;/u&gt; - your father&lt;br/&gt;eje&lt;u&gt;ň&lt;/u&gt; - your mother
|Your (sing., informal)&lt;br/&gt;'''-yň''', '''-iň''' ('''-uň''', '''-üň''')&lt;br/&gt;ad&lt;u&gt;yň&lt;/u&gt; - your name&lt;br/&gt;it&lt;u&gt;iň&lt;/u&gt; - your dog
|Your (pl., formal)&lt;br/&gt;'''-ňyz''', '''-ňiz'''&lt;br/&gt;kaka&lt;u&gt;ňyz&lt;/u&gt; - your father&lt;br/&gt;eje&lt;u&gt;ňiz&lt;/u&gt; - your mother
|Your (pl., formal)&lt;br/&gt;'''-yňyz''', '''-iňiz''' ('''-uňyz''', '''-üňiz''')&lt;br/&gt;ad&lt;u&gt;yňyz&lt;/u&gt; - your name&lt;br/&gt;it&lt;u&gt;iňiz&lt;/u&gt; - your dog
|-
|His/her/it's&lt;br/&gt;'''-sy''', '''-si'''&lt;br/&gt;kaka&lt;u&gt;sy&lt;/u&gt; - his/her/it's father&lt;br/&gt;eje&lt;u&gt;si&lt;/u&gt; - his/her/it's mother
|His/her/it's&lt;br/&gt;'''-y''', '''-i'''&lt;br/&gt;ad&lt;u&gt;y&lt;/u&gt; - his/her/it's name&lt;br/&gt;it&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt; - his/her/it's dog
|Their&lt;br/&gt;'''-sy''', '''-si'''&lt;br/&gt;kaka&lt;u&gt;sy&lt;/u&gt; - their father&lt;br/&gt;eje&lt;u&gt;si&lt;/u&gt; - their mother
|Their&lt;br/&gt;'''-y''', '''-i'''&lt;br/&gt;ad&lt;u&gt;y&lt;/u&gt; - their name&lt;br/&gt;it&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt; - their dog
|-
|}

As mentioned already, the noun alone already indicates possession, so pronouns such as ''meniň'', ''seniň'', etc., don't HAVE to be used. For example, in Turkmen ''My name is John'' could either be ''Meniň adym John'' or simply just ''Adym John''.

As you can see in the above table, possessive suffixes for nouns are not only about vowel harmony, but also whether the noun, in it's nominative form, ends in a vowel or a consonant.

You've also probably noticed that '''at''' changes to '''ad-''' when a suffix is added to it. The word '''at''' is merely one of the few irregularities of the Turkmen language, and its good that you're getting used to it at an early stage.

===Is?===
You may be wondering what the word for &quot;is&quot; is in Turkmen. The truth is, there isn't one.

If you tried to translate &quot;he is&quot; by itself into Turkmen, or any Turkic language for that matter, it would be impossible. If you tried to translate &quot;he is good&quot; into Turkmen, it would translate as ''o ýagşy'', which would translate word-by-word back into English as &quot;he good&quot;.

It works in the same way in &quot;Siziň adyňyz näme?&quot; and &quot;Meniň adym...&quot;, which literally translate word-by-word as &quot;Your name what?&quot; and &quot;My name...&quot; respectively.

===Sentence order===
Turkmen, like other Turkic languages, follows an '''SOV''' ([[w:Subject Object Verb|Subject Object Verb]]) sentence order. Don't know what [[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[w:Object (grammar)|object]] or [[w:Verb|verb]] are? Let's look at a very basic demonstration in English, which uses SVO instead of SOV:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;Bobby&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;kicked&lt;/font&gt; the ball.'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''S'''&lt;/u&gt;ubject&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''V'''&lt;/u&gt;erb&lt;/font&gt; &lt;u&gt;'''O'''&lt;/u&gt;bject&lt;/center&gt;

In this case, ''Bobby'' is the subject, because he is the one kicking the ball (i.e. the subject is the word executing or otherwise attributed to the verb); ''kicked'' is the verb because it is a word of action (i.e. verbs show what is taking/has taken/will take place); and ''the ball'' is the object because it is being kicked by Bobby (i.e. something happens to the object by the subject by means of the verb).

Now that we've established what the subject, object and verb actually are, you'll be able to understand that in Turkmen, the subject goes first, then the object, and then the verb. This is true in most cases, but in some instances, mostly in sentences without verbs such as ''O ýagşy'' or ''Siziň adyňyz näme?'', the sentence order is just SO. Unlike in English, in which all sentences need to have verbs, in Turkmen certain things such as &quot;he is nice&quot; can be demonstrated, as shown in the [[#Is?|Is?]] section of this page, without the use of a verb.

On the other hand, as a result of pronouns not being needed in Turkmen, sentences can also be verb only, such as &quot;geldi&quot; (he came), although the subject (he) is still technically in the verb, so &quot;geldi&quot; itself is both a subject and a verb. If you look at it in this sense, then you'll find that all Turkmen sentences have at least a subject.

We will look at verbs in more detail at a later stage in this book.

'''It is certainly worth practising everything you've learned in this lesson with an exercise. [[/Exercise|Click here to do this lesson's exercise.]]'''

It is also worth reading about [[:w:Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[w:Object (grammar)|object]] and [[w:Verb|verb]] on Wikipedia for a better explanation of these things.

In September 1919 the German army assigned a soldier named Adolf Hitler, in his new position as investigative officer, to a meeting of the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (German Workers' Party, abbreviated DAP). During the meeting Hitler took umbrage with Gottfried Feder, the speaker, arguing that Bavaria should be wholly independent from Germany, and two days later on September 14, Hitler joined the party.

Hitler began to transform the party, renaming its militia from the Rollkommandos to the Ordnertruppen. On February 20, the party added National Socialist (Nationalsozialistische) to form the initials NSDAP, or Nazi Party. Four days later Dr. Gottfried Feder and Hitler announced the 25-point programme of the party. Throughout the year Hitler began to lecture at Munich's beer halls, with the police monitoring him. Hitler delivered lectures with titles such as Political Phemenenon, Jews and the Treaty of Versailles.

On July 11, 1921, Hitler resigned from the party after Anton Drexler, the party's leader, proposed dissolving the party into a larger Kampfbund coalition. Hitler rejoined once the policy was abandoned as a result of his withdrawal and on July 28 assumed control of the party by outcasting Drexler. 

Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome Hitler decided that a coup d'état had to be instigated in order to seize control of the country. In May, elements loyal to Hitler within the army helped the SA to procure a barracks and its weaponry but the order to march never came.
When the beer hall putsch failed, Hitler was sentenced to five years imprisonment. He served only a little over eight months and used the time in jail to dictate the first volume of Mein Kampf. After the putsch the party was banned, but contested 1924's two elections by proxy as the National Socialist Freedom Movement. In the German election, May 1924 the party gained 32. In Bavaria the NSDAP took 15.9% and in Thuringen 10.5% of the vote. The lowest vote tally was in Schaumburg-Lippe with just 2.48% of the total vote. Overall 6.55% (1,918,329) voted for the Movement.

Hitler was released from Landsberg Prison on December 20, 1924 and less than three months later on February 16, 1925 – prompted by Hitler’s promise to aim at attaining power only through legal means – the ban on the Nazi party was lifted. 

In the German election, May 1928 the Party achieved just 12 seats (2.8% of the vote) in the Reichstag. The highest provincial gain was again in Bavaria (5.11%) though in three areas the NSDAP fail to gain even 1% of the vote. Overall the NSDAP gained 2.63% (810,127) of the vote. 
===Violence and Success===
During this time, the party's tactics moved to violence. After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler the SA marched into the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders.  In September Goebbels led his men into Neukölln, a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire. On January 14, 1930 Horst Wessel got into an argument with his landlady – the Nazis said it was about rent, but the Communists alleged it was over Wessel’s soliciting of prostitution on her premises – which would have fatal consequences. The landlady happened to be a member of the KPD, and contacted one of her Rotfront friends, Albert Hochter, who shot Wessel in the head at point-blank range. Wessel had penned a song months before his death which would become Germany’s national anthem for 12 years as the Horst-Wessel-Lied). Goebbels also seized upon the attack and the two weeks Wessel spent on his deathbed to premier the song. The funeral was designed to be a propaganda opportunity for the Nazis, however the Rotfront stole Wessel’s wreath and wrote ‘pimp’ onto it. Along with Horst Wessel, the year 1930 resulted in more deaths due to political struggles than the previous two years combined. 

On April 1 Hannover enacted a law banning the Hitlerjugend (the Hitler Youth), and Goebbels was convicted of high treason at the end of May. Bavaria banned all political uniforms on June 2 and on June 11 Prussia prohibited the wearing of SA brown shirts and associated insignia. The next month Prussia passed a law against its officials holding membership of either the NSDAP or KPD. Later in July Goebbels was again tried, this time for ‘public insult’, and fined. The government also placed army officers on trial for &quot;forming national socialist cells&quot;.

Hitler sent shockwaves through the Reichstag obtaining 107 seats (18.3%, 6,406,397 votes) and becoming the second largest party. In Bavaria the party gained 17.9% of the vote though for the first time this total is outnumbered by most other provinces. An unprecedented amount of money was thrown behind the campaign. Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for usage in Berlin alone. Furthermore in areas where NSDAP campaigning was less rigorous the total was as low as 9%. The Great Depression was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success. Yet against this legal backdrop the SA began it's first major anti-Jewish action when on October 13 1930 groups of brownshirts smashed the windows of Jewish-owned stores at Potsdamer Platz.

===Hitler Comes to Power===
In March 10 1931, with street violence between the Rotfront and SA spiralling out of control, breaking all previous barriers and expectations, Prussia re-enacted its ban on brown shirts. Days after the ban SA-men shot dead two communists in a street fight, which led to a ban being placed on the public speaking of Goebbels, who side-stepped the prohibition by recording speeches and playing them to an audience in his absence.

Ernst Röhm, in charge of the SA, put Count Micah von Helldorff, a convicted murderer and vehement antisemite, in charge of the Berlin SA. The deaths mounted up, with many more on the Rotfront side, and by the end of 1931 the SA had 47 men killed, and the Rotfront recorded losses of approximately 80. Street fights and beer hall battles resulting in deaths occurred throughout February and April 1932, all against the backdrop of Adolf Hitler’s competition in the presidential election which pitted him against the monumentally popular Hindenburg. In the first round on March 13 Hitler had polled over 11 million votes but was still behind Hindenburg. The second and final round took place on April 10: Hitler (36.8% 13,418,547) lost out narrowly to Paul von Hindenburg (40% 19,359,983) whilst KPD candidate Thälmann gained a meagre percentage of the vote (10.2% 3,706,759).

The attacks continued, and reached fever pitch when SA storm leader Axel Schaffeld was assassinated. At the end of July the Nazi party gained almost 14,000,000 votes securing 230 seats in the Reichstag. Energised by the incredible results Hitler asked to be made Chancellor. Papen offered the position of Vice Chancellor but Hitler refused.

In November 1932, Papen left office and two months later secretly told Hitler that he still held considerable sway with Hindenburg and that he would make Hitler chancellor as long as he could be the vice chancellor. On January 30 Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of a coalition government of the NSDAP-DNVP-Centre Party. The SA and to a lesser extent the SS lead torchlight parades throughout Berlin. In the coalition government three members of the cabinet including Hitler and also Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick and Hermann Göring as Minister Without Portfolio were Nazis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/u&gt;

Within the past two decades, the inclusion movement has evolved whereby a majority of citizens have equal access to appropriate instruction, resources and services.  Only since the 1990s have institutions of higher learning recognized the need to establish and/or improve support systems and services for students with a disability.  (Fitchen, C.S., Asuncion J.V., Barile, M., Robillard, C., Fossey M.E. &amp; Lamb, D., 2003)   Technological advances in the 21st century have contributed to Internet reliance and “postsecondary entities, like the rest of our society, use the Internet more and more for the things that they do” (WEBAim, n.d., p.7).  The “Web is becoming an everyday part of life for many people” (Berry, n.d., p.1).


Fallis (2005) discusses the responsibility that universities have towards the creation of a “democratic life with special obligations regarding accessibility and inclusion” (p. 3).  The environment in and around the university has evolved from isolation and exclusion, to segregated educational settings, to inclusive educational institutional environments where people with disabilities are in the classroom as full, participating members with access to appropriate resources.  More recently, government, administrators, educators, parents and students alike, have realized that education is a fundamental right of all Canadians and have established laws and processes to become more student “friendly” and include individuals with a disability in all aspects of education.   


Including students with diverse disabilities in mainstream “can be a difficult and complex matter” (Loreman, T., Deppeler, J. &amp; Harvey, D., 2005, p.3).   “Each student’s needs are unique and must be considered afresh when an accommodation request is made.”  (Ontario Human Rights Commission, 2004, p.5)  According to Hill (1992), in order for a student with a disability to have a successful and positive experience in university two obstacles must be overcome, including availability of specialized services to “maximize the student’s ability to participate fully in the chosen course of studies” (p. 49) and “the campus must be physically accessible” (p. 49).  The specialized services include providing access to the Internet which will provide access to information and facilitate communication.  According to Kaye (2000) “Computer technology and the Internet have a tremendous potential to broaden the lives and increase the independence of people with a disability.”  (p.1)  


&lt;u&gt;'''Education as a Matter of Social Justice'''&lt;/u&gt;

“Discrimination pervades our structural institutions, and to the extent that schools are microcosms of the larger society, they are not immune to its effects.”  (Dei, G., James-Wilson, S. &amp; Zine, J., 2002, p.2)   Barriers to education have significant implications on the social structures of society, the labour market, healthcare and other elements.   A lack of proper education can manifest into one’s livelihood resulting in possible unemployment, increased social ineptness, incompetence, dependency, poverty and other issues.  Individuals with disabilities have suffered from this injustice and until recently, were marginalized, often with inequitable access to education.    Although there have been significant developments in technology in recent years “the computer revolution has left the vast majority of people with disabilities behind” (Kaye, 2000, p.1).  


Education must be accessible and society must recognize that each individual is a contributing member.  “When one student is not a full participant in his or her school community, then we are all at risk.”  (Sapon-Shevin, 2003, p.27)   Individual differences, unique characteristics and differing abilities must be recognized and reflected in a “whole” society.    Hutchinson (2001) provides a historical account of inclusion as it relates to the educational system.  It has been well documented that until very recently people with a mental disability were often marginalized and placed in institutions without exposure or access to resources, programs and people.  Although significant strides have been made to remove barriers, the Ontario Human Rights Commission (2004) maintains that “a significant number of students with disabilities continue to face obstacles in their attempts to access educational services in Ontario”. (Ontario Human Rights Commission, 2004, p. 5)  The Ontario Human Rights Code “guarantees the right to equal treatment in services, without discrimination on the ground of disability.  Education, in its broadest sense, is a “service” within the meaning of the Code.”  (Ontario Human Rights Commission, 2004, p.6)   The Government of Ontario, through the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, is committed to removing all barriers by the year 2025.  (Government of Ontario, 2005)   


Universities have a vital role to play in the development and establishment of democracy and “must be accountable for their contributions to democratic life” (Fallis, 2005, p. 3).   Fallis (2005) discusses the idea of a liberal education and its relevancy and importance to building a democratic and prosperous society.  Accessibility is a key component of Fallis’ (2005) position, recognizing that “accessibility is measured by whether visible minorities, persons with disabilities, and aboriginal peoples are able to attend (p.13).   


&lt;u&gt;'''Inclusion and Higher Education'''&lt;/u&gt;

“One cannot understand the mission of the modern Canadian university without understanding its responsibility to be accessible to all who are capable of and willing to undertake university study.”  (Fallis, 2005, p. 12)  Higher education for students with a disability serves many purposes and is so important as it provides a means to enriching life through the fulfillment of personal goals, accessing jobs, offers financial independence and social prestige, lowers unemployment, improves quality of life and the standard of living.  (Fitchen et al., 2003)    


In February 2005 the Honourable Bob Rae released a report and subsequent recommendations relating to the status of postsecondary education in the province.   As the report suggests, “persons with disabilities can face formidable barriers to accessing postsecondary education” (Government of Ontario, 2005, p.69).   Issues including transition from high school to university, early identification of the students’ disability or needs, access to technology, stronger linkages and partnerships between secondary and postsecondary, service provision while at university and transitional services for students with a disability entering the workplace are all components of accessibility which must be further addressed if the inclusion agenda is to progress.  


In order to more fully understand and address the various challenges and barriers encountered by students with a disability, and create a more inclusive environment, Fuller, M., Healey, M., Bradley, A. &amp; Hall, T. (2004) offer several recommendations for “supporting disabled students’ learning” (p.315).  Accessibility for students with a disability is individualistic and can include whether the students are “are able to attend” (Fallis, 2005, p.13).   Attendance, though, is not just limited to one’s physical presence; it also includes participation through assistive devices which make online communication a viable learning alternative.   Education serves as “a core public commitment for social citizenship, because full membership requires equality of opportunity, which education can help to provide”.  (Fallis, 2005, p.17)     


The New York Education Department (2000) discusses the many advantages and benefits to having students with a disability involved in higher education.  Aside from increased enrolments and access to a more diverse talent pool, the New York Education Department (2000) notes that students with a disability “make very concrete contributions besides addition to the overall academic and campus life experience” (p.7). 


“It is only the past two decades that North American institutions of higher education have begun to recognize the need to deliver disability related services to people with disabilities.”  (Fitchen et al., 2003, p.7)  Hill (1992) found that “both small and large institutions are attempting to accommodate special needs students” (p.72)   Wilchesky (1986) as cited by Hill (1992) attributes an increase in enrolment to four main reasons including the pressure from advocacy groups to improve access to higher education, an emphasis on the recruitment of “non-traditional” students, the increased awareness on the mission of the university to provide more access to higher education, services and resources, and the passage of legislation.  


One of the key elements to achieving accessibility involves the provision of opportunities, programs, courses and services “to fit the needs of a variety of learners” (Smith, D.C., Cameron, D.M., Gorbet. F., Henerderson, C. &amp; Stephenson, B.M., 1996, p.26).  In the 21st century, access includes removing barriers to technology and making certain adjustments so that information can be readily available on the Internet.    Cox and Klas (1996) indicate that institutions of higher learning have responded to many challenges related to physical limitations or barriers encountered by architectural structures.   However, the issue of knowing and understanding the full extent of one’s disability, such as a learning disability, remains problematic.  Nelson and Lingnugaris/Kraft (1989) also address the issue of service provision for students with a disability and indicate that “a clear understanding of learning disabilities is lacking in many college programs” (p.2).   


For students with a disability the issue of access to education has become very important, in particular access “to the environment of the Internet” (Rowland, 2000, p.1).  According to Rowland (2000), “the web is a fundamental tool in postsecondary education” (p.3) and that “the intent of postsecondary education is to help prepare an educated citizenry to become participatory, productive members” (p.3).  Without access to the Internet the student experience is limited which in turn, compromises one’s capacity to learn and succeed.  


There are many barriers which prevent and/or limit Internet access for students with a disability.  According to Kaye (2000), people with disabilities “have among the lowest rates of use of these technologies” (p.13).  Issues such as cost, insufficient access to specialized software and “lack of awareness of the potential benefits of this technology” (Kaye, 2000, p.13) may contribute to limited accessibility.   Heaviside,. S., Rowand, C., Hurst, D. and McArthur, E. (2000) further add that “insufficiently trained special education teachers” (p.1) is a major issue.  


The attitude of faculty toward students with a disability and the types of accommodations that must be provided by faculty to appropriately address the student needs is also a challenge.  Hill (1992) notes the concern over accommodating “the learning disabled student at the postsecondary level” (p.74) and the limitations experienced by faculty in accommodating students because of insufficient information or knowledge about the nature of the disability and how to appropriately deal with the situation.  


&lt;u&gt;'''Closing Remarks'''&lt;/u&gt;

Within the last two decades, society has witnessed the progression of a more inclusive education system which includes more access to online information and communication.   With the establishment of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) significant inroads have been made “to make it easier for people with disabilities to use the Web” (W3C, 2005, p.2).


A “postsecondary education is no longer a luxury of the wealthy but a necessity for anyone who wants to enjoy a decent lifestyle” (Wall &amp; Sarver, 2003, p. 282).  Fallis (2005) discusses at length the mission of the university and in particular its responsibility to society.  As Fallis (2005) argues, society must expand the dialogue to include students with a disability who are valued, contributing members of this society.  In Ontario, the government is committed to furthering the inclusion agenda.  “Ontario colleges and universities must be highly responsive not just to enrolments…but to the variety of needs those students have.  Institutions should explore both traditional and innovative approaches to the provision of postsecondary education to find a blend that responds to their students’ needs.”  (Smith et al., 1996, p.72) 


An inclusive system of education promotes unity and is beneficial in a variety of ways.  “Many of the accessibility solutions described in WAI materials also benefit Web users who do not have disabilities.”  (W3C, 2005, p.2)   The inclusion movement is still progressing and “postsecondary education must evolve in a way which provides the opportunity for a high-quality learning experience to every Ontarian who is motivated to seek it and who has the ability to pursue it”. (Smith et al., 1996, p. 5)

__NOTOC__{{commonscat|Knots}}{{wikipedia|Knot}}

Several types of knots can be distinguished for a variety of purposes. Although in many cases any knot can be used for any specific purpose, these specialised knots have been invented to be able to perform any specific job in the most efficient way (e.g. facilitating untying after a job has been done).

==Contents==

===Introductory material===

*[[/Introduction/]]
*[[/Rope/]]
**[[/Natural fibre/]]
**[[/Synthetic fibre/]]
**[[/Webbing/]]
**[[/Caring for cordage/]]
*[[/Properties of knots/]]
*[[/Components/]]

===Basic knots===
{{see also|:Category:Knots/Basic knots}}

This is a simplified list of knots which keeps a balance between usage for many purposes, reasonably good performance (e.g. easy untying, difficulty of laying the knot) and a fair amount of simplification (to avoid needing to learn a great number of them). These basic knots will still allow you to help yourself out in survival situations and in low-tech construction (e.g. in the developing world).
[[File:EdioWerplijnsteek.jpg|thumb|A [[Knots/Heaving knots/Heaving line knot|heaving line knot]]]]

* '''[[/Loop knots/Bowline|Bowline]]''' for making a loop
* '''[[/Binding knots/Constrictor|Constrictor]]''' for tying a rope to something solidly
* '''[[/Lashing/Diagonal lashing|Diagonal lashing]] and [[/Lashing/Round lashing|round lashing]]''' for holding pieces of structures together in low-tech construction
* '''[[/Stopper knots/Figure-eight knot|Figure-eight knot]]''' for making a part of a rope too big to fit back through a hole
* '''[[/Hitch knots/Lark's head|Lark's head]]''' for vertically (gravitational tensing) hanging, or horizontally (if tension is assured) link a rope to another or to an object if slippage can be avoided by that object structure, position and or stability.
* '''[[/Binding knots/Reef knot|Reef knot]]''' a specialization of the '''Lark's head''' for tying two lines or the ends of a single line together such that they will secure something that is unlikely to move much, initial tension will make it more reliable than the simpler '''Lark's head''' if constant tension is not guaranteed.
* '''[[/Bend knots/Sheet bend|Sheet bend]] and [[/Bend knots/Double sheet bend/|double sheet bend]]''' for tying two ropes together in general situations
* '''[[/Hitch knots/Two half hitches|Two half-hitches]]''' for quickly tying a rope to something

===More knots===

The list of knots is extensive, but common properties allow for a useful system of categorization. For all the knots, see [[:Category:Knots]].

;[[/Bend knots/]] :A knot uniting two lines (for knots joining two ends of the same line, see [[/Binding knots/]] or [[/Loop knots/]] [[w:list of bend knots|(list of bends)]].
;[[/Binding knots/]] :A knot that restricts object(s) by making multiple winds [[w:list of binding knots|(list of binding knots)]].
;[[/Coil knots/]] :Knots used to tie up lines for storage [[w:Coil knot|(coil knots)]].
;[[/Decorative knots/]] :A complex knot exhibiting repeating patterns often constructed around and enhancing an object [[w:list of decorative knots|(list of decorative knots)]].
;[[/Heaving knots/]] :Knots that make a line easier to throw. 
;[[/Hitch knots/]] :A knot tied to a post, cable, ring, or spar [[w:list of hitch knots|(list of hitch knots)]].
;[[/Lashing/]] :A knot used to hold (usually) poles together [[w:Lashing (ropework)|(lashing)]].
;[[/Loop knots/]] :A knot used to create a closed circle in a line [[w:list of loop knots|(list of loop knots)]].
;[[/Slip knots/]] (or Running) :A knot tied with a hitch around one of its parts, contrasted. with a loop, which is closed with a bend.  A slip knot can be closed, a loop remains the same size [[w:Slip knot|(slip knots)]].  
;[[/Seizing knots/]] :A knot used to hold two lines or two parts of the same line together [[w:Seizing|(seizing)]].
;[[/Sinnet knots/]] :A number of lines interwoven in a pattern [[w:Sennit|(sinnets)]] [[File:Affenfaust vier Kugeln.jpg|thumb|Some [[Knots/Heaving knots/Monkey fist|monkey fists]]]]
;[[/Rope splicing/]] :A method of interweaving strands of rope to join sections together.  More time consuming but usually stronger than simple knots [[w:list of splices|(list of splices)]].
;[[/Stopper knots/]] :A knot tied to hold a line through a hole [[w:Stopper (knot)|(stoppers)]].
;[[/Trick knots/]] :A knot that is used as part of a magic trick, a joke, or a puzzle [[w:trick knot|(trick knots)]].
;[[/Whipping/]] :A binding knot used to prevent another line from fraying.

'''Welcome''' to my user page.  I am active on the [[:w:en:User:Kahuroa|English Wikipedia]], on [[:commons:User:Kahuroa|Wikimedia Commons]], and I am a Bureaucrat on the [[:mi:User:Kahuroa|Māori Wikipedia]] where I took the number of articles from 400 to over 6000.
* I help out on pages relating to the Māori people of New Zealand, and also Polynesia and the Pacific generally. 
* I am interested in subtropical and tropical trees and plants, especially those of the northern [[:w:en:North Island|North Island]] and the South Pacific.
* One of the biggest contributions I make to Wikipedia, as far as using up my own time goes, is to create and source images to illustrate the articles. I have uploaded over 350 of [[:Commons:Category:Files by User:Kahuroa|my own photos]], almost 150 [[:Commons:Category:PD Old files uploaded by User:Kahuroa|Public Domain files]], and I have also started bringing photos in from other libraries such as [[:w:en:User:Kahuroa/flickr|flickr]].

==Translation==


# 你家住那裡？ 
# 我住在遼東城內。 
# 你有什麼事要到京城去？ 
# 我趕這馬帶去賣。 
# 若是那樣最好。
# 我們趕帶的這馬及馬上所馱的夏布、葛布也是賣的，你我既然都到同一個地方去做生意，一齊做伴去的便是了。
# 阿哥你原來是走過的人，京城的馬價如何？
# 新近我有相識的人來說，這一向馬價很好，這一等的馬值十五兩，這一等的馬值十兩。
# 葛布的價錢好不好呢？ 
# 葛布價錢說是與去年的價錢一樣。 
# 京城的食物短缺嗎？富裕嗎？ 
# 我問認識的那個人，據說他將要來時，八分銀子一斗白米，五分銀子一斗小米，一錢銀子十斤麵，二分銀子一斤羊肉。
# 這樣的話，與我去年在京城時的價錢一樣。
# 我們今天晚上到那裡去住宿？ 
# 我們往前行十里地方，有一個店，名叫瓦子店，我們不論早或晚到那裡去住宿，倘若過去了的話，那邊二十里之地，沒有人家，那樣的話，前面趕不到村莊，後面又回不到店，我們到那裡去住宿吧！到的早時，好讓我們的馬、牛歇息，明日早點走吧！
# 從這裡到京城大概還有五百餘里路，若上天眷顧身體安好時，再過五天諒可到達吧！
# 從這裡到京城有幾里路？ 
# 我們去到後在那裡住好呢？ 
# 我們往順城門官店去住，從那裡離馬市也近些。 
# 你說的是，我的心裡也是這樣想了。 
# 每年我們從遼東去的客人們，不住別處，都住在那裡，去年我也在那裡住過，很好。
# 你的這些馬牛，每夜吃的草豆共需多少錢？
# 一個夜晚每匹馬各五升豆一束草，通共合計需二錢銀子，因地方收成豐歉不一樣，草豆價錢貴賤也不同，要是草豆歉收的地方則需三四錢銀子，要是草豆豐收的地方則需二錢銀子。
# 這匹馬的腳步如何？ 
# 這匹馬的腳步也不算很好，但因有一點小走，所以似乎比駑馬強些，此外別的都不好。
# 你帶這馬和葛布到京城去賣了之後，還要買些什麼貨物帶回朝鮮地方去賣？
# 我到山東濟寧府東昌高唐去收買絹子綾子棉花，到王京去賣。
# 你如果到那裡去做生意，有一點利益嗎？ 
# 那也還好，我去年跟著一位漢人伙伴到高唐去收買些棉絹，帶到王京去賣後得了一些利益。
# 你是以多少價錢在原地購買那些綾絹棉的，到王京去以多少價錢出售呢？
# 我買的小絹一匹三錢，染成淡紅做裡子，綾子一匹二錢，染成鴉青與淡紅，染絹子一匹給價二錢，染綾子一匹，鴉青的是一匹三錢，淡紅的是一匹二錢，綿花一斤六錢銀子。到王京去賣，絹子一匹值細葛布二匹，折銀一兩二錢，綾子鴉青的一匹值葛布六匹，折銀子三兩六錢，淡紅的值葛布五匹，折銀子三兩，棉花四兩值葛布一匹，折銀子三錢，除了牙稅不計外，再算時獲利很多。
# 你從錢到京城裡賣了貨物，又買棉絹到王京去做生意時，往返走了幾個月。
# 我從去年以來攜帶馬匹和葛布到京城去都賣完了，五月裡到高唐去收買棉絹，由直沽坐船過海，十月裡到了王京，將近年終，把貨物都賣了，又買了這些馬匹夏布葛布帶來了。
# 這三個人是你的親戚呢？或是相遇而來的呢？以前因未及請教姓名，現在敢請賜告，這位阿哥貴姓？
# 這位姓金，是我姑母所生的表哥，這一位姓李，是我舅舅所生的表哥，這一位姓趙，是我鄰居的伙伴。
# 你這位表兄弟，想是遠族的表兄弟吧！
# 不，我們是親表兄弟。 
# 雖然這樣，你們沿路隨便互罵戲謔，全無迴避。
# 實在太得罪了啊！我們走路時，若禮讓行走時一定會打瞌睡，所以故意開玩笑啊！
# 我們暫且休說閑話吧！眼前這個便是瓦子店，去找個很乾淨的店住宿，讓牲口歇息吧！
# 岔路口北邊這個店是我以前住過的房子，我們到這裡去住宿吧！
# 噯喲主人阿哥在家啊，這一向貴體與府上都好嗎？
# 好，王姓大哥來了嗎？多時不見了，你們各位伙伴從那裡遇見來的？
# 我們沿路相遇做伙伴到京城去。 
# 你這店裡草豆都有嗎？ 
# 草豆都有，豆是黑豆，草是穀草，這穀草好，若是稻草時，牲口等多有不吃的。
# 黑豆多少一斗，草多少一捆？ 
# 豆是五十個錢一斗，草是十個錢一捆。
# 這是真的嗎？你不要再瞞我。 
# 阿哥你這是什麼話？你也是走熟的客人，我們如同一家，我怎麼敢胡說，你不信的話，到別的店裡去試問，可得知我的真假。
# 我想你也不是騙我的人，有什麼去試問之處？

==Translation==

# 我們的馬十一匹，共量六斗豆，給十一捆草。這鍘刀不快，這麼多草怎麼切得了，主人你到別處借一口快鍘刀拿來吧。
# 這樣的話，我去借，這口鍘刀也是我們同族人家的，他原來不肯借，因受不了我再三請求，好不容易才勉強給了，很銳利，你小心些使用不要把人家的刀口崩壞了。
# 這位伙伴切的草很粗，牲口怎麼吃，細細的切吧！我看這人好像不大會煮豆，你先燒火，鍋子滾了以後再放豆，但再一滾就將切了的草，撒在豆的上面覆蓋著，不要燒火，不要讓它走了氣，這樣的話，自然而然就熟了啊！
#  客人們你們看，我會不會燒火，我若是不會燒火，不是白白喝風嗎？
# 你不要多說話，趕緊去做五人份的飯吧！
# 你要吃什麼樣的飯呢？
# 給我們五個人做三斤麵的餅吧！
# 我去買菜餚。
# 你若去買菜餚，到隔壁家去買豬肉，是今天才殺的新肉。
# 多少錢一斤？
# 二十個錢一斤。
# 這樣的話，主人你替我去買，因買一斤肉不要太肥的，買瘦一點的肉，切大塊一點炒熟了拿來吧！
# 主人如果來不及做，我們伙伴裡頭派出一人來炒肉吧！
# 我不會炒肉。
# 這有十麼難處，把鍋刷洗乾淨，燒火，鍋熱時放進半盞白麻油，油沸後把肉倒進鍋裡，用鐵勺翻炒半熟後再把鹽、醬、水、胡椒、醋、蔥各樣物料撒進去，把鍋蓋覆蓋上去，不讓它出氣，燒一次火以後就熟了啊！
# 這肉熟了，你嚐嚐看，鹹淡如何？
# 我嚐得有一點淡，再放些鹽吧！
# 主人阿哥，我明天五更時分早點啟行，在你府上住宿的價錢及做飯的價錢算一算吧！一個晚上住宿的人所需房錢，做飯的價錢，餵馬的草料，總計多少？
# 你稱了三斤麵，每斤十個錢，共計三十個錢，切了一斤肉二十個錢，四個人，每人房錢及火錢十個錢，共計四十錢，黑豆六斗，每斗五十個錢，共計三百個錢，草十一捆，每捆十個錢，共計一百一十個，合計該五百個錢。
# 我們的草豆麵，都是來你家裡買的，你少算一點如何？
# 好吧好吧，就算四百五十個錢吧！
# 若是這樣，伙伴們你們三人都出，記著數目，到北京時，再合計總數給吧！
# 若是那樣，我都給他。
# 伙伴們你把豆撈出來，在冷水裡泡著，等馬歇息一會兒慢慢的餵，開始餵時，只將豆和水拌著，到五更時將豆都給牠吃，若是這樣時，馬吃的多，且肚子能飽。倘若先給豆時，那馬只揀了豆吃，將草都拋撒了，疲乏時暫勿飲水，等吃一點空草後再飲。各自睡一會兒，輪著起來用心餵馬才好，如果只推在一人身上，必至眈誤。今天是二十二曰，五更時候一定有月光，雞叫時起來便走吧！
# 主人家點個燈拿來，我們整理睡處。 
# 燈點來了，掛在牆壁上。
# 像這樣的土炕上面怎麼睡，若有草蓆的話，拿幾塊來吧！
# 因為我家沒有蘆蓆，所以送來這三塊草蓆，你們將就鋪一個晚上吧！
# 主人家你把火埋起來，我們明天五更時候清早就走。
# 是，就這樣吧！客人們歇息，我看看門戶就睡。
# 來吧！暫且不要走，我有話問你，我上回由北京來時你們這店西邊二十里處，有一座橋塌了，現在修好了沒有？
# 早已修好了，比以前高二尺，寬三尺，做得很好。
# 若是這樣我們明天可以放心早早的去啊！
# 你不要早去，我聽說前頭路不好。
# 噯喲！以前一點也沒有這樣過，現在怎麼有這樣的歹人出現呢？
# 你不知到，從去年以來，因天旱，田禾欠收，年歲飢荒，所以歹人出來。
# 你不用為我們耽心，不要緊，我們只趕幾匹馬去，又並沒有什麼好財貨，那盜賊要把我們怎樣？
# 不要這樣說，盜賊怎麼知道你們有沒有錢，小心些比較好。
# 去年六月我們這裡有一個客人在纏帶裡裝著一卷紙，背在腰上，在路旁樹底下蔭涼地方歇息睡著，被一個賊從那裡走過看見了，以為腰上所背的東西是錢物，突生惡念，就揀起一塊大石頭把那人的頭上打了一下，打出腦漿來死了。那賊把那人的腰帶解開來看時，因為只是紙，就從那裡悄悄的躲避走了，官府捉不到打殺沒有名字的罪犯，白白的把無辜的地主在近鄰人疑猜刑訊，別處將那賊捉住送來後，這一件事才弄清楚了。
# 去年又有一個客人，驢背上馱著兩筐棗子行路時，有一個騎馬的賊帶著弓箭，從後頭追上來，走到酸棗林無人空曠地方，從背後射箭，那人滾落地上後，那賊心想已經死了，便趕著那驢子往前走。那位客人中箭昏迷許久甦醒過來時，恰好碰到捕盜官來巡邏，那位客人清清楚楚的稟告，捕盜官帶著弓兵，往前走到二十里地方捉拏時，那賊射中一兵，從馬上跌下來，向西逃跑。捕盜官跟蹤到村裡，調了一百個壯丁，帶了弓箭器械，在山谷周圍包圍拏獲那賊後回來看那中箭的人，那人左胳膊雖中箭受傷，尚非致命，現在那賊在官牢內監禁著，誰不知道呢？
# 噯喲！既然這樣，早說路上不好的話，我們並無緊急事情，何故早走，等到天亮時慢慢的去有何耽誤之處，天亮時再走吧！
# 客人們好好睡吧！
# 主人家我又忘了一件事，我們這馬不曾飲水，歇息的工夫去飲水，那裡有井？
# 那房子後面有井。
# 有沒有打水的柳罐呢？ 
# 井很淺，用繩柳罐打水，井旁有飲馬的石槽。
# 若是這樣，把柳罐繩子都找來吧！
# 都在井旁。
# 還有話請問你，那柳罐若不沈水怎麼辦？
# 你若不會使柳罐下沈時，可在柳罐上面栓一塊石頭。
# 這個我也知到，你不必教。
# 我們輪著起來用心餵馬，常言道，馬不吃夜草不肥，人不得橫財不富。
# 我們把拌草餵馬後去飲水，沒有盛草的筐子，用什麼東西帶草呢？
# 若是沒有，暫且用葛布衫裹草帶去，我送豆水去。
# 這主人家做事很不爽快，攪豆棒一根也沒有。
# 算了，就拿我們的拄杖來攪豆。
# 暫且在炕上坐著歇息一會兒，等馬吃完這些草去飲水。
# 如果我們都去時，無人可看顧這炕了。
# 留一個看顧炕，此外別的人牽馬去時，有什麼好怕的，就是一人也不留，這店裡的門若是關緊時有什麼人能進來。
# 常言道，年年防飢，時時防賊，你依我的話留一人看顧炕吧！
# 我們留誰看炕，三人同行時必定勞累年輕人。
# 算起這個，我們三人理應前往。
# 這山谷很窄，馬牽的多時過不去，我們分兩次牽去。
# 你的水打得很熟了，你先去打水，我們兩個在後頭牽馬去。
# 我去打水，你們帶馬來。
# 剛才把兩柳罐水倒進這槽裡，飲馬吧！
# 這匹馬水喝的略足，這匹馬水喝的恰恰好。
# 這水少了再打一罐倒進去吧！
# 拿柳罐來，我試學打水，這柳罐一點不往旁邊倒，怎麼樣才能打水呢？
# 我教你，把柳罐繩子稍微提起來，往下扔一下，水自然被盛起來。
# 我從前雖曾看過人打水，但不曾學過，今天自已一試才得明白了。

#[[/Notes on contributors/]]

We invite interested readers to co-edit and comment on [[/Feminist Invitational Collaboration in a Digital Age: Looking over Disciplinary and National Borders/]], which serves as the first chapter of the Wikibook '''Gender, Communication, and Technology: Women's Creative Networking Across Disciplinary and National Borders'''. 

We hope to develop this Wikibook and relevant resources together with teachers and students in different universities; we are open to many sorts of collaboration. We also welcome discussion of the chapters and ideas for collaboration. For discussion, click on &quot;discussion&quot;; for editing, click on &quot;edit this page&quot; (see tabs on the top of this page); For contributions on other book chapter topics, click on [[/Other book chapter topics/]].

We suggest starting with a list of guidelines for our Wikibook:

#A commitment to keep the conversation about diversity and unity alive throughout the collaboration; 
#A commitment to a fluid and circuitous process of collaboration; 
#A commitment to the active recruitment and support of minority people and diverse viewpoints; and
#A commitment to encouraging these voices to have special advisory roles in the work to contribute to diversity of experiences and viewpoints. 

Invitational collaboration assumes that bringing many perspectives into the conversation is not left to chance. We are writing about academic research and discussion. Yet, we are proposing much more diversity of contributions than is usually present in academic discussions.

'''Please, make sure that your additions are your own work, not copied from other sources.''' '''And please enter your name in the section of [[/Notes on contributors/]].  Thank you!'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Opticks supports processing almost any type of remote sensing data and makes adding capability easy. Using the plug-in architecture and public interface, you can quickly add your own processing algorithms or support for new types of remote sensing data. The plug-in architecture and public interface enable hundreds of developers to extend the capabilities of Opticks while minimizing conflicts. Opticks is also open source and licensed under LGPL 2.1. This means you can easily extend Opticks functionality, provide the capability to the open source community, or even embed it in your commercial application. 

Opticks development features:

* Extensive API. Hundreds of classes with hyper-linked documentation. See the Opticks 4.1.1 API.
* LGPL v2.1 license. This license allows any plug-ins that you write to be placed under your own license, be it a commercial or open-source.
* Large development community. Over a hundred developers and twenty organizations are already developing with Opticks.
* Native Opticks functionality built using the public API. Over 150 plug-ins included in the core software.
* Software development help using the developer mailing list and mailing list archives. Ask questions of the project team members and get your development questions answered.
* Access to the full source code. Access to the Opticks source code isn't necessary to start building your own plug-ins. However, the source code is available if you want to extend the core capability or need help understanding Opticks. The source code is available on the downloads page.

Visit the Opticks site for more information: http://www.opticks.org

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Online learning communities as an integral part of blended learning strategy'''


''Introduction''

Nowadays, the concept of an online community is becoming increasingly popular in education as it encourages collaborative learning. While building a learning community continues to be one of the challenges in online education, a blended learning approach, that integrates the strengths of face-to-face and computer-mediated instructional modes (Graham, 2006), enables one to develop a sense of community and enhance the quality of interaction among community members (Guldberg &amp; Pilkington, 2006; Owston, Wideman, &amp; Murphy, 2008). In blended learning environments, an online community creates opportunities for learners to interact informally, network, mentor, and learn from one another. Students’ engagement in an online community enables them to share tacit knowledge and increase individual effectiveness (Kaplan, 2008).


''Concept of an online learning community''

A community usually refers to a group of people with common interests living in a particular area (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2008). The emergence of computer conferencing tools, social networking platforms and web-based collaboration technologies has shifted a physical place-based concept of community building to a web-based concept (Bringelson &amp; Carey, 2000; Palloff &amp; Pratt, 1999). There are currently many different terms designating the meaning of an online learning community: virtual or online, web- or Internet-based learning communities, communities of practice, or knowledge networks. 


An online learning community (OLC) is a web-based learning environment replete with the latest digital technologies where interconnected learning participants communicate, collaboratively construct their knowledge, and share their personal experiences (Palloff &amp; Pratt, 1999; Preece, 2000; Richardson, 2006). OLCs are often characterized by active interaction, collaborative learning, socially constructed meaning, sharing resources, and expressions of support and encouragement (Palloff &amp; Pratt, 1999). Powazek (2002) describes an online community as a group of connected individuals with a strong emotional bond provided with web tools, for instance, bulletin boards, chat rooms and threaded discussions, for continuous participation and open discussion among members of the community. In contrast to social networks, OLCs utilized in educational practice incorporate the process of learning, knowledge construction, and community building with the purpose of developing a strong sense of community among learners and achieving mutually the intended learning goals (Downes, 1999; Palloff &amp; Pratt, 1999; Rovai, 2001). Harasim, Hiltz, Teles, &amp; Turoff (1997) describes an online learning community as “a group of people who use computer-mediated communications (CMC) to learn together, at the time, place, and pace that best suits them and is appropriate to the task” (p. 4). 


Online communities are created on the basis of shared common interests, collaboration and with the aid of CMC.  They evolve through the same stages as face-to-face communities (Palloff and Pratt, 1999; Shaffer &amp; Anundsen, 1993). However, in the process of achieving group connectedness and collaboration, the participants of online communities often feel less nervous and reserved, compared to the members of face-to face communities. Such liberation of the online participant is explained by the absence of verbal, physical, social, racial and other discriminatory cues that appear in a natural communication (Macduff, 1994; Palloff &amp; Pratt, 1999; Trend, 2001).   


From a design perspective, online learning communities can be emergent and designed. An emergent, or natural, OLC is developed by learning participants themselves for the purpose of information sharing and exchange of personal experience. The functioning of such community is characterized by an unscheduled engagement, a high level of learners’ intrinsic motivation, and a specified interaction context which is based on common interests of the community members.  The designed, or customized, OLCs are developed for educational needs by technology corporations, e.g. Tapped In©, My e-coach©, etc. The customized online community platforms are previously equipped with a set of different communications and collaboration tools, storage and sharing capabilities, technical and moderation support. Instructors often use these community solutions to build online groups for their students to meet particular learning goals (Harasim et al., 1997; Mayer, 2005).


''Components of an online learning community''

Besides appropriate digital interactive and collaborative facilities, an OLC has the following attributes: (a) a common vision of a community agenda, (b) active participation and collaboration, and (c) establishment of trust (Preece, 2000; Rovai, 2000; Wang, Sierra, &amp; Folger, 2003). Considering the physical separation of participants in OLC, it is necessary to form a sense of community at the beginning of its development (Rovai, 2001). Often, the participants are expected to introduce each other to the community and share their own experiences, needs, interests, goals and expectations with the rest of their members. In the further process of community development, the learners strengthen their community identity through their acceptance of responsibilities inherent in OLC membership and active participation in mutual knowledge building, collaborative activities, problem-solving, decision-making, peer evaluation and others (Palloff &amp; Pratt, 1999; Preece, 2000; Wang, Sierra, &amp; Folger, 2003). 


While participating in activities designed for OLC, learners and instructors share various roles. Instructors serve as facilitators, community builders, instructional managers, coaches, and moderators. Wenger (1998) emphasizes that teachers are learning resources not because of their institutionalized status and pedagogical intentions but because they share the same membership with their students and embody their identities as participants in a learning community, ''“[a teacher ] … brings into the subject matter the concerns, sense of purpose, identification, and emotion of participation”'' (p. 276-277). Learners, in turn, take on knowledge construction, collaboration and process management (Palloff &amp; Pratt, 1999). 


Lastly, it is necessary to develop the feeling of trust among members within an online learning community (Rovai, 2001; Wang, Sierra, &amp; Folger, 2003). Rovai (2001) describes trust as the feeling of safety and support.  Trust is associated with reciprocity of personal experiences, emotions and beliefs with one another (Wang, Sierra, &amp; Folger, 2003). Palloff and Pratt (1999) point out the importance of discussing with each other such issues, as openness, honesty, safety, and privacy, in order to maintain a secure and well-integrated environment.


Use of an online learning community in blended learning environments
For online learning communities to be effective in blended learning, they must be integrated fully into its pedagogical framework (Kaplan, 2008). Building an online learning community usually starts with engagement of learners in well-organized introductions through web-based technologies prior to a face-to-face meeting. This provides an opportunity to reinforce the personal relationships between learners, establish community etiquette and ground rules, and speed up the processes of openness, sharing, and collaborative learning when learners eventually meet in person. 


Following a face-to-face meeting, OLC should provide opportunities for learners to be engaged in structured interactive experience, for instance, guided online discussions, brainstorming, sharing group projects, discussing findings from literature review, team research, and receiving mentoring from peers and instructors. It makes possible to extend personal relationships, strengthen group interaction and, on the whole, enrich students’ learning experience: 

:::''Once learning communities are truly functional and connected to the world in meaningful ways, teaching events can be designed around them as resources to their practices and as opportunities to open up their learning more broadly. Again, there is a profound difference between viewing educational design as the source or cause of learning and viewing it as a resource to a learning community'' (Wenger, 1998, p. 271).


''Benefits of online learning communities for blended learning''

Recent studies have revealed several benefits of the application of online learning communities in blended learning environments. The incorporation of OLC in blended learning programs brings out new alternatives to build a sense of community, advance conventional ways of communication, collaboration and knowledge building. Initial face-to-face sessions motivate students to online interaction and strengthen the connections among students for their continuous collaboration and learning success in the online community (Palloff &amp; Pratt, 1999). For example, a strong majority of participants reported that given opportunities to share experience and innovative ideas in face-to-face sessions assisted them not only to strengthen professional connections, but also to decrease the feeling of isolation (Owston, Wideman, &amp; Murphy, 2008).


Students indicated the importance of the reflections in order to be successful in the learning process. In particular, they refer to the use of discussion boards as an interactive facility of OLC where they can express their opinions, comment on their peers’ postings and provide critical feedback (Menchaca, 2006; Owston, Wideman, &amp; Murphy, 2008). While evaluating the work of their peers, the students adhere to collaborative rather than competitive positions and, therefore, they build respect for others’ beliefs and develop a supportive learning community (Wang, Sierra, &amp; Folger, 2003). 


In OLCs, students are exempt from any discriminatory cues of face-to-face communication and, thus, concentrate their learning on the meaning of message (Harasim et al., 1999).  Also, OLCs allow learners to receive the same and elaborated messages from several sources in various media formats over time. For instance, a topic discussed in a face-to-face classroom, can be elaborated on in the online community, and actual examples are stored in the online shared repository (Rossett, Douglis, &amp; Frazee, 2003).
Through the use of OLC interactive properties, a teacher can foster different learning styles while teaching students (Menchaca, 2006; Richardson, 2006; Rovai, 2001). As an illustration, “social learners” prefer to collaborate with other participants in synchronous chat discussions. In contrast, “readers and writers” prefer to reflect on their learning through asynchronous discussion boards (Menchaca, 2006). 


''Conclusion''

The incorporation of online learning communities in blended learning is gaining in popularity at a rapid rate. The reviewed literature suggests that the use of online communities in blended learning opens up the opportunities for informal learning and mutual engagement in the creation of learning products. Even though researchers have studied intensively the structure and impact of online communities on the student learning process, learning through an online community is still a new field and much needs to be examined to better understand the learning architecture of an online community and what factors influence a common sense of community, meaningful interaction, active engagement in knowledge construction and sharing.

==A Brief History of Literacy==

Before we consider the current definitions of [[w:Information_literacy|information literacy]] and their ramifications on classroom pedagogy, we should take a look at the historical context of information literacy and of [[w:literacy|literacy]], in general. In 1965, Ernest Roe spoke of &quot;'promoting the efficient use' of resources&quot; in The Australian Journal of Education. The term &quot;information literacy&quot; was first coined by Paul Zurkowski in 1974 in a report entitled The Information Service Environment, Relationships and Priorities (Bundy, 2004, p. 45). The present-day definition of &quot;information literacy&quot; comes from the 1989 Presidential Committee on Information Literacy's ''[http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlpubs/whitepapers/presidential.cfm Final Report]''. This report states that &quot;[t]o be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information&quot; (American Library Association, para. 17).

The concept of literacy, however, existed long before Ernest Roe and Paul Zurkowski began speaking of information literacy. Literacy has been defined as the ability to sign one's own name, to read and write, both in a rudimentary or in an advanced manner, and has even been limited to the ability to read and write in Latin (Davis, n.d., para. 1; Stroup, 2001, para. 1). The concepts of literacy versus [[w:functional literacy|functional literacy]] are stilled argued today. In ancient times, literacy rates are estimated to have been no more that 15% and that no more that 5% of the population engaged in advanced studies (Davis, n.d., para. 1). In the Middle Ages, literacy was generally associated with the ability to speak, read, and write Latin, regardless of the ability to speak, read, and write in one's own vernacular (Stroup, para 1). According to Stroup, &quot;[b]y the 16th century, the invention and advancement of printing technology in Europe, and the growing use of languages other than Latin, resulted in an explosion in literacy levels, extending even to people of traditionally lower social classes, such as peasants and merchants&quot; (2001, para. 1).

In the United States, Kenneth Lockridge estimates that, by the late 1700s, over 80% of New England males could sign their wills and that over half of the rest could read (Schudson, 1978, p. 39). In Massachusetts, the [[w:Massachusetts_School_Laws|&quot;Old Deluder Act&quot; of 1647]] required that each town establish a grammar school. Students in these schools were taught reading from the New England Primer, which contained, among other things, a pictorial alphabet. The entry for &quot;A&quot; reads: &quot;In Adam's Fall, We Sinned all&quot; (Newman, 2002).

In the mid-1800s, William Holmes McGuffey, a lifelong educator with an interest in promoting public education, developed his ''[http://www.lib.virginia.edu/small/exhibits/hoos/images/reader.JPG Eclectic Readers]''. McGuffey thought that education and religion went hand in hand and his ''Readers'' reflected those beliefs (National Park Service). As you can see, literacy during these times was directly related to business and religion.

The United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ([[w:Unesco|UNESCO]]) has defined and redefined the concept of literacy. In 1951, it defined a literate person as one &quot;who can with understanding both read and write a short, simple statement on his every day life&quot; and, in 1978, revised it to mean one's ability to &quot;engage in all...activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning in his group and community and also for enabling him to continue to use reading, writing, and calculation for his own and community's development&quot; (Stroup, para. 2). This revision reflected a movement towards ''functional'' literacy, including mathematics and other methods of communication as adequate for literate individuals.

Today, we view literacy in many lights. Rather than looking at literacy as an all-encompassing concept, we acknowledge multiple literacies including, but not limited to, media, computer, visual, and, of course, information literacies. We no longer focus so much on one's ability to read and write but on one's ability to use those skills to function as a member of their community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are some health related issues to know about before playing a game. All gamers should be aware of these.


== Main Health Issues ==

===Sore Joints/Muscles===
Sometimes, when playing a video game(s) for a prolonged period of time, your joints or muscles will become sore and tired. Experts recommend a fifteen-minute to half-an-hour break from video games every hour to two hours.

===Seizures and Epilepsy===
People who are photosensitive should consult a physician before playing a game due to the risk of seizures. 

==Debated Health Issues==
===Mental Effects===
Many argue the topic as to whether video games can drive a person to suicide or to homicides. Although studies have been conducted and concluded that video games cannot do this, people with mental health issues should be monitored while playing video games.

== Forward ==


The development of this book is part of an education course, ITEC521 Information Literacy in the Digital Age, at the University of Mary Washington College of Graduate and Professional Studies in Fredericksburg, VA. The book's primary [[Introduction to Information Literacy in the K12 Classroom/Contributors | Contributors]] are graduate students and preservice teachers.

The goal of this project is two fold; 


* to create a student-authored textbook that highlights important concepts as they relate to information literacy in the digital age that can be utilized by K12 teachers around the world, and 


* to empower each teacher author with knowledge of digital literacy, effective communication, collaborative participation, and the idea that technology is an effective tool as it relates to each of these skills that can be transfered into their classroom.


Please take time to explore this book and let us know what you think. The Discussion tab on each page or the Talk tab are two locations within our book that you can leave comments, suggestions, or information pertaining to particular authors, content, or pages themselves. We look forward to your participation and feedback.


Each chapter of this book was researched and written by one to two students and edited by the entire class. Each section has media added to enhance the content and meaning on each page. The supplemental section for each chapter will provide any worksheets or additional information that was deemed important for that particular chapter.


Thank you for taking a look at our book we hope you find it useful and meaningful.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Every gamer is different, and therefore will enjoy different video games. Choosing the right game type is important for the overall enjoyment of the game.

&lt;!-- Leave comments about triple eqaulity sign section organization at talk page before making any edits to it, please. --&gt;
===First Person Shooter===
First person shooters, commonly known as FPS games, demand a moderate-level of concentration while playing. These games can be easily played by both hardcore and casual gamers, and are a popular type of game.

FPS games nearly always feature only a first-person perspective. Usually these types of games use projectile weapons, namely guns, however some have been known to use swords, knives, and bows in their gameplay.

===Roleplaying Games===
Technically, all games are roleplaying games(RPGs), which require you to play a role, however most games deemed as 'true' roleplaying games contain a system of levels and statistics, as well as missions in the form of quests. These games require a moderate to high level of concentration while playing, and are designed for hardcore gamers. 

These games can feature either first-person or third-person perspective, and many times contain a system of fighting, usually along with a wide array of weapons, in their gameplay.

=== Platformers ===
Many platforming games are old and considered classics. However, there are newer platforming games out in stores, so if you want a taste of the old times or you want to walk right into the action, platforming games are for you. Generally played by casual gamers, it isn't hard to be a hardcore gamer playing platforming games.

Contrary to popular belief, platforming games can be either 2D or 3D. Platforming games are most commonly the former, and feature a side scrolling view. These games commonly include enemies with jumping as the main attack to defeat them, as well as bosses similar to the enemies.

=== Puzzle ===
Puzzles were made way back when they didn't have video games. Puzzle games keep these creations 'alive', in a sense. These games usually focus on one main puzzle, although there are some out there that focus on many different puzzle types, or many similar puzzles. Some brain training games also include puzzles.

Puzzle games are usually 2D, and are usually played by the casual gamer. Puzzles have also been incoporated into many other genres of games, and playing puzzle games can help you become better at other types of games.

=== Online Games ===
Online games are a dime a dozen. Many of them are 2D, although you can find some that are 3D. There are many sites which house popular online games, two of which being [http://addictinggames.com] and [http://miniclip.com]. Online games can be very addicting, and are many times used as a stress reliever. 

Online gamers are usually casual, although some are hardcore. Many online games appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers due to the fact that many fangames can be found online, which appeal to the casual gamer more than the actual games do.

==== Massively-Multiplayer Online Games ====
Massively-multiplayer online games are usually referred to as MMOGs. MMOGs are very popular, and always include some sort of multiplayer interaction. MMOGs can either be text-based or graphical, with most of the graphical MMOGs being 3D.

Massively-multiplayer online games can be multiplayer versions of many game types, such as first-person shooters(MMOFPS) and roleplaying games(MMORPG). Depending on the type of multiplayer game you choose, it can be harder or easier to play as simply a casual gamer.

== Templates TOCleft, TOCright, and TOClimit not working as needed - Probably needs an admin to fix ==

Hello. I am trying to limit the Tables of Contents in some really long lists in the Wikibooks Bartending Manual.

I followed the help on Meta for working with TOCs for articles. It led me to exactly what I was looking for on Wikipedia. I didn't notice (at first) that it was under a heading of &quot;Wikipedia specific&quot;. Here's the help section: [w:Wikipedia:Section#Limiting_the_TOC|Limiting the TOC]

I tried just updating the {{tl|TOCright}} template using Wikipedia's as the source, but I think the problem is this:
 class=&quot;toclimit-{{{limit}}}&quot;

Wikipedia probably uses either JavaScript, CSS, or something to dynamically reduce the size of the TOC based on that ''class''.

Is there a way to patch Wikibooks to support that highly useful feature? If not, is there a Wikibooks way of doing something similar of which I am not aware?

The page I'm editing is [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary]]. Unless somebody changes it back, you will see that the TOC on the right runs A-Z, except that under B, all the drink names are now showing. That is because I changed them from ; to ===== as per an earlier comment posted on the Talk page. Changing the drink names to heading 5's does make sense. The formatting looks identical, but more importantly, it makes it possible to link directly to the drink here.

That is an important feature for what I'm trying to do. Namely, help improve both Wikibooks and Wikipedia by moving tiny &quot;recipes&quot; over from Wikipedia into our bartending manual (which is why I need to link to the individual recipies), and link from the manual back to Wikipedia for drinks that already have an encyclopedic article about the drink. This has been a goal of both the Wikipedia WikiProject Mixed Drinks and the Wikibooks WikiProject Bartending for over a year now.

I would really appreciate some help. Since I'm a little new to the bureaucratic processes here at Wikibooks, I wasn't sure where else to make this request. If this is the wrong place, please don't bite me. Just help me move the request wherever it belongs. Thanks! --[[User:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;#C71585&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;'''Willscrlt'''&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;(&lt;font color=&quot;#4169E1&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Willscrlt|'''T'''alk]]&amp;middot;[[Special:Contributions/Willscrlt|'''C'''ntrb]]&lt;/font&gt;)&lt;/small&gt; 08:35, 23 May 2008 (UTC)

: After looking at this a bit more, it seems like it's just some CSS (and maybe some JavaScript) that needs to be added to the monobook styles. How does that get done, and who does it? I'm not talking about recreating the wheel here... just copy the bits already working from the English Wikipedia over to here. There actually are several things I've noticed that don't quite work the same from a template level here that work fine at the English Wikipedia and some other Foundation wikis. Fortunately, several things do work here that don't on others (i.e., some, but not all, of the Monobook tweaks are installed here that help with templating). --&lt;font face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;[[User:Willscrlt|'''&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Will&lt;/font&gt;'''&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;scrlt&lt;/font&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Willscrlt|&lt;font color=&quot;royalblue&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt; 16:32, 8 June 2008 (UTC)

I have fallen for the ''can't make a parameter code work within preformatting tags'' pitfall.

It's too late for me; I am a blunderer!

But it's not too late for you: Save yourselves! Learn it now!    

I thank you, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 17:23, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

:I figured out what your problem is. Check out [[User:Whiteknight/Template sandbox]] and [[User:Whiteknight/Sandbox]] for the solution. It doesn't have all the fancy formatting (although you could probably use some kind of HTML span or something to add the fancy stuff). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 17:46, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

Hi, I am sorry but I cannot understand your solution.   I was trying to make an improved preformatted text template by using style rules in the preformatted text tag.   In fact, ''that'' part is '''entirely practical'''; all of the font and colorings could be changed.

The problem in making a template to do this is that, although the ''styles'' are honoured, when you reach the point where you do the multi-bracketted parameter specification in the template design, because the template's ''outside'' tags are preformatting tags, the parameter design code is treated as if it were just text.   That is, there is no way to make such a template.

The preformatting tag formats '''can be improved as an inline style''' though, if a better format is all that is needed.   For example, inline styling ''within'' the tags gives:
&lt;pre style=&quot;text-align:left;border:none;background:papayawhip;color:maroon;font-family:Arial;overflow:auto;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;This text is in preformatting tags,
and note that there is no dotted border now.
There is a 10pt Arial font.
The background and text are now coloured.&lt;/pre&gt;
This is the text in plain tags: 
&lt;pre&gt;This text is in preformatting tags,
and note that there is no dotted border now.
There is a 10pt Arial font.
The background and text are now coloured.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
Wouldn't it be nice if a template ''were'' possible.   I ''now'' think that it would be impossible.
Thanks for your comments anyway;  Regards, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 17:51, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

:Its not impossible. I tweaked it some the other day, and tweaked it some more today. Here is the exact styling using {{tlx|prettypre}}:
{{prettypre|background=papayawhip|color=maroon|font=normal 12pt Arial|This text is inside prettypre. Notice how there are no borders, the font is 10pt Arial, and the background and text are colored.}}
:--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:52, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

::Nice one!-but I still cannot follow how you did it.   You seem to have another template there that I am not familiar with.   Good job!  Now, while genius is upon you, do you think you could get the powers that be to introduce a ''line-continuation'' character for markup the way that VBA has?  Regards, [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 12:52, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

Normally text is already considered one continuous
line if there is no blank lines in-between. Like
I am doing here. In the future questions like this
should really be asked in the [[WB:TECH|Technical
Assistance Reading Room]] --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:25, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

: The best approach is to upload the photo to [http://commons.wikimedia.org The Commons], as they do not have a waiting period (Wikibooks has something like a four day waiting period between registration and upload privs).

::As Jomegat said, go to the commons. It can be a bit of a hassale(as it was for me) but it makes everything a little bit easier, especially if you work on more than just wikibooks.

:::Actually, we're less concerned with porn etc. than with things being uploaded with no license/source info, false info, copyvio, etc. The idea with requiring autoconfirmed is that folks will be forced to wait and might read the relevant policy or even just the info at [[Special:Upload]] before uploading.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Reality of Internet Filtering/Blocking  

By G. Chabrol.

While every educator will agree that the value of the computer and the Internet as an educational aid to learning is no longer debatable, there remain grave concerns about how much inappropriate material is on the Internet and how best to avoid it reaching students.  As students become more computer savvy, this situation becomes more acute as they soon find ways to access it anyway.  Besides the social (communication) and political (freedom of speech) ramifications of this issue, an additional problem is that digital technology is not static.  It is constantly evolving, changing and expanding.  As soon as a solution protocol is found, the technology improves and the issue of filtering is exacerbated.  But is Internet filtering/blocking desirable?  The overwhelming point of view in the literature suggests that it is not desireable.

The issue is succinctly stated by T. A. Callister Jr. et el. In, Just Give It To Me Straight: A Case Against Filtering The Internet:

“One of the most controversial and contentious issues surrounding the use of new information and communication technologies, especially in schools and libraries, is whether or not authorities should filter students’ access to the Internet.  Like other kinds of “filter”, Internet filters keep out “bad” content while allowing “good” content to pass through (Callister et el.2004). 
  
Callaister et el. Agrees that every parent has a right to monitor what their children are exposed to on the Internet and television.  But “Schools and libraries, on the other hand, have a wider educational responsibility to expose students to a broader range of ideas, experiences and point of views” (Callister et el.).  More schools than ever are being equipped with computers with access to the internet.  This is both a good thing and a problematic in other ways.  It is good for the purpose of education and learning as students are hooked up to the world and there is no limit to research potential.  Conversely, they can and will in all likelihood be exposed to inappropriate material, often unsolicited.   It then must fall on the teacher/school to ensure a secure screening method is used.  They must screen for content and be aware of the Board’s policies on this matter.  Many Boards for instance have policies prohibiting the use of inappropriate language, hate material, racist comments, sexism, etc.  

There are any numbers of ways to do this.  For instance, computers in the lab/class could be blocked by the teacher to certain sites which are deemed inappropriate.  Or, the computer could be loaded only with specific material peculiar to the curriculum thus excluding the need to use the internet.  Some schools use site licenses to load DVD’s and run all programmes from it.  Alternatively, where Boards of education may have their own servers, as many of them do today, access to certain sites are blocked centrally.  What level of access is desired is determined by such things as grade level and Board policy.  However, the practice of denial of access is a controversial issue.  For instance, as noted in her book, “Access Denied”, Lynn Sutton (2006), from as far back as 2000, “the Commission On Online Child Protection presented its final report (COPA, 200) to the congress” (Sutton, p.11).  Essentially, “The report stated that the best internet filtering technologies can be highly effective in directly blocking access to content that is harmful to minors, but noted that there are significant concerns about first amendment issues when filters are used in libraries and schools” (Sutton, p.11).  By and large, “the vast majority of content is blocked because it is sexually explicit, though chat rooms, email and software downloads are also formats that are commonly blocked” (Sutton, p.11).

In 2004, L.B Ayre conducted a study that also looked at the status of filtering technology (Sutton, p.11).  He noted that filters used several methods for blocking data: word blocking…and site blocking, which matches URLs against a list of predetermined sites (Rosenburg, 2001) (Sutton, p.11).  Another commission to study the use of Internet filtering technology was the Committee to Study Tools and Strategies for Protecting Kids from Pornography and Their Applicability to Other Inappropriate Internet Content” of the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board of the National Resource Council” (Sutton, p.11).  They found that “due to the nature of filters, ‘underblocking’ and ‘overblocking’ errors are inevitable” (Sutton, p.11).  Based on this study, one of their findings was that “while the issue of underblocking and overblocking should not, in and of in itself, rule out filters as a useful tool, the extent of underblocking and overblocking is a significant factor in understanding and deciding the use of filter” (Sutton, p.12) (Thornburg ).  They further noted legal challenges to government – mandated filters focused primarily on underblocking and overblocking problems” (Sutton, p.12).  But perhaps their more telling conclusion is that “social and educational strategies”, more than technologies are most useful. (Sutton, p.12)

At the same time, schools, perhaps motivated among other things, by the fear of liable suites{Change to &quot;libel suits&quot;, please?}, are increasingly installing filtering technology ostensibly for the protection of students.  For instance, “since 2001, the children internet protection act requires schools receiving the federal communication commissions universal service e-rate discount to install “technology protection measures” (i.e. filters) on computers with internet access” (Sutton, p.12).  Because of this action, “according to Cattague and Farris (2001), the e-rate program has been largely responsible for the increase in internet access in public schools” (Sutton, p.12).  This notwithstanding, Sutton argues, the individual rights to free speech remains important and would be challenged if the government should impose limits.  The advantages of filters in school libraries was studied by Josh (2001), Powell and Bailey (1999).  They found that the reduced chances of a student accessing “inappropriate material must be balanced against the knowledge that any kind of commercial filter will almost certainly block appropriate material, with a corresponding risk of violating students’ “first amendment right” (Sutton, p.13).  This position is not unanimous however.  According to some speech advocates such as Callister and Burbules, (2003); Knanich (2004) and Willard, (2003), they are quite open in their assertion that using filters are over-protective and “damaging in the long run” (Sutton, p.12).

All of this is not lost on the students.  As more students become technologically savvy, they are becoming increasingly more frustrated with limitations on their Internet access in schools” (Sutton, p.13). Levin and Arafeh (2000) conducted studies that looked at the attitudes and behaviours of students using the Internet in schools.  In their work, they used qualitative methods to describe these students’ reactions.  They summarize the frustration by students this way: “while many students recognize the need and or desire to shelter teenagers from inappropriate material and adult-orientated commercial ads, they complain that blocking and filtering software raise significant barriers to their legitimate, educational use of the internet” (p.19) (Sutton, p.13).  

In her book, “Access Denied”, Lynn Sutton (2006), noted “[B]ecause of the legal controversies surrounding the Children’s Internet Protection Act in recent years, the literature has been filled with various kinds of studies and opinion pieces on the effectiveness of filters” (p.13).  She noted that the Kaiser study that is reported in Richardson, et el., 2002, looked at the differences that filters made in removing a large amount of harmless material (p.13). The authors of this study focussed their attention on adolescents’ use of the Internet for health reasons.  “The objective of the study was to measure how much pornography-blocking software used in schools and libraries limits access to health information Web sites” (p.13).  They found that: 

“The use of filtering software in public schools is of special concern, because adolescents’ health concerns often focus on issues related to sexuality, and because those who do not have computers at home rely on schools and libraries for Internet access (p. 2888) (p.15). 

The author (of this study) also stated that there is a “surprising lack of empirical studies on blocking errors” (p.15).  As a methodology, they used simulations of searching of health information questions.  What they found was surprising.  “The results showed only minimal overblocking of litigitimate health sites at the “least restrictive” level, but significantly more overblocking at the “most restrictive” level”. (Sutton, p.14).  They also noted that the amount of overblocking varied according to the topic, but such topics as “safe sex’ was blocked much more extensively than others such as breast cancer, for instance.  These findings prompted the authors of the study to put forth the following warning:   
There may be principled reasons why some schools or libraries choose to block more than pornography, including some kinds of health information.  These decisions, however, should be viewed as important policy decisions and not mere technical configuration issues to be left to network administrators” (p. 2893).

The importance of this argument is emblematic of the discourse in this field.  For instance, as Sutton (2006) points out, “in a statement to the Kaiser Study, noted free speech activist Nancy Williard (2002) emphasized the dangers of oveblocking at the most restrictive level and states “this study clearly demonstrates the concerns about placing reliance on filtering software” (p.3).  Countering this position, H. Auld, author of the article “Filters work: Get over it” in American Libraries (2003) believes that he study’s findings indicated that filters, when operated at their least restricted setting, posed only a minor impediment to searching for health information (for instance)” (Sutton, p.15)   Another impediment to access is that schools that implement internet blocking software will block at a minimum tens of thousands of sites inappropriately because the Web pages are miscategorised (p.15).  So in effect, “the level of filter settings can be identified as a key element in the overall effectiveness of a filtering program”(Sutton, p.15).  

So in conclusion, although Internet filtering/blocking software has been subjected to some intellectual scrutiny in recent years, it is fair to say that, given that there is no clear consensus on its usability, and given that the proliferation of inappropriate material is not likely to end any time soon, a good deal more needs to be done if a viable solution is to be found.  In all likelihood, total agreement on this issue will not be found as the issue is too complex.  But whatever is developed, a crucial caveat must be adhered to according to Kaiser.  He warns “Any complete discussion of the literature on filtering technology must include an accounting of legal challenges to government-ordered restrictions on Internet speech” (p.16).  As is agreed by all, protection of our children is crucial.  How we go about doing this remains the challenge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Brian, I moved your section to its own section. I think that the Introduction to information literacy can be all encompassing, introducing each of the sections and chapters. What do you think? What does everyone think? I can be out voted here.

I think this works well as a subsection of the introduction.  The intro can address the book and then the reader can move on to some background.  This still introduces the concepts and prepares them for the meat of the book to come.  I would like some suggestions on how to make this piece more interactive.  Unfortunately, the history of literacy is not terribly interactive in nature.  I still plan to add some questions and sites at the bottom.  Any suggestions for interactivity?--BM</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Before the Battles==
The Battles of Lexington and Concord are generally considered the start of the American Revolution. British General Thomas Gage, the military governor and commander-in-chief,  received instructions, on April 14, 1775, from Secretary of State William Legge, the Earl of Dartmouth to disarm the rebels, who had supposedly hidden weapons in Concord, and to imprison the rebellion's leaders.

On the morning of April 16, Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 50 men under the command of Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment into the surrounding country to intercept messengers who might be out on horseback. This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past, staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness. The Lexington Militia in particular began to muster early that evening, hours before receiving any word from Boston.

Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith received orders from Gage on the afternoon of April 18 with instructions that he was not to read them until his troops were underway. They were to proceed from Boston &quot;with utmost expedition and secrecy to Concord, where you will seize and destroy… all Military stores… But you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants or hurt private property.&quot; 

The rebellion's ringleaders – with the exception of Paul Revere and Joseph Warren – had all left Boston by April 8. They had received word of Dartmouth's secret instructions to General Gage from sources in London long before they had reached Gage himself. Samuel Adams and John Hancock had fled Boston to the Hancock-Clarke House, home of one of Hancock's relatives in Lexington where they thought they would be safe.

The Massachusetts Militia had indeed been gathering a stock of weapons, powder, and supplies at Concord, as well as an even greater amount much further west in Worcester, but word reached the Colonists that British officers had been observed examining the roads to Concord. On April 8, they instructed people of the town to remove the stores and distribute them among other towns nearby.

===Warning the Colonists===

Between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m on the night of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told William Dawes and Paul Revere that the King's troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's intelligence suggested that the most likely objectives of the British Army's movements later that night would be the capture of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. They worried less about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord. The supplies at Concord were safe, after all, but they thought their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and alert Colonists in nearby towns.

Dawes covered the southern land route by horseback across Boston Neck and over the Great Bridge to Lexington. Revere first gave instructions to send a signal to Charlestown and then he traveled the northern water route. He crossed the Charles River by rowboat, slipping past the British warship HMS Somerset at anchor. Crossings were banned at that hour, but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode to Lexington, avoiding the British patrol and later warning almost every house along the route. The warned men and the Charlestown colonists dispatched additional riders to the north.
[[Image:Paul Revere's ride.jpg|thumb|250px|The ride of Paul Revere.]]
After they arrived in Lexington, Revere, Dawes, Hancock, and Adams discussed the situation with the militia assembling there. They believed that the forces leaving the city were too large for the sole task of arresting two men and that Concord was the main target. The Lexington men dispatched riders in all directions (except south), and Revere and Dawes continued along the road to Concord. They met Samuel Prescott at about 1:00 a.m. In Lincoln, these three ran into a British patrol led by Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment and only Prescott managed to warn Concord. Additional riders were sent out from Concord.

Revere and Dawes, as well as many other alarm riders, triggered a flexible system of &quot;alarm and muster&quot; that had been carefully developed months before, in reaction to the British colonists' impotent response to the Powder Alarm. &quot;Alarm and muster&quot; was an improved version of an old network of widespread notification and fast deployment of local militia forces in times of emergency. 

Around dusk, General Gage called a meeting of all of the senior officers of his army at the Province House. He informed them that orders from Lord Dartmouth had arrived, ordering him to take action against the colonials. He also told them that the senior colonel of his regiments, Lieutenant Colonel Smith, would command, with Major John Pitcairn as his executive officer.

==Lexington==
The British began to awaken their troops at 9 p.m. on the night of April 18 and assembled them on the water's edge on the western end of Boston common by 10 p.m.

As the British Army's advance guard under Pitcairn entered Lexington at sunrise on April 19, 1775, 77 Lexington militiamen, led by Captain John Parker, emerged from Buckman Tavern and stood in ranks on the village common watching them, and spectators watched from along the side of the road. Parker was later supposed to have made a statement that is now engraved in stone at the site of the battle: ''&quot;Stand your ground; don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.&quot;'' 

Rather than turn left towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, at the head of the advance guard of light infantry companies from the 4th, 5th and 10th Regiments of Foot, decided on his own to protect the flank of his troops by first turning right and then leading the companies down the common itself in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. These men ran towards the Lexington militia loudly crying &quot;Huzzah!&quot; to rouse themselves and to confuse the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies lay behind the village meeting house on the road back towards Boston.
[[Image:Battleoflexingtonengraving.jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle of Lexington]]
Pitcairn then apparently rode forward, waving his sword, and yelled ''&quot;Disperse, you rebels; damn you, throw down your arms and disperse!&quot;'' Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home, but, because of the confusion, the yelling all around, and due to the raspiness of Parker's tubercular voice, some did not hear him, some left very slowly, and none laid down arms. Both Parker and Pitcairn ordered their men to hold fire, but suddenly a shot was fired from a still unknown source. 

Some witnesses among the regulars reported the first shot was fired by a colonial onlooker from behind a hedge or around the corner of a tavern. Some observers reported a mounted British officer firing first. Both sides generally agreed that the initial shot did not come from the men on the ground immediately facing each other. 

Witnesses at the scene described several intermittent shots fired from both sides before the lines of regulars began to fire volleys without receiving orders to do so. A few of the militiamen believed at first that the regulars were only firing powder with no ball, but then they realized the truth, and few, if any, in the militia managed to load and return fire. The rest ran for their lives.

The light infantry companies under Pitcairn at the common got beyond their officers' control. They were firing in different directions and preparing to enter private homes. Upon hearing the sounds of muskets, Colonel Smith rode forward from the grenadier column. He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly. The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter, and, once they were rounded up, the light infantry were then permitted to fire a victory volley, after which the column was reformed and marched towards Concord. At Lexington, the British had suffered one killed, while the colonists had suffered 8 killed.

==Concord==
The militiamen of Concord, uncertain of what had actually transpired at Lexington, were not sure whether to wait until they could be reinforced by troops from towns nearby, or to stay and defend the town, or to move east and greet the British Army from superior terrain. As the regulars began to approach, they did all of these. The Minutemen watched from a hill as Smith deployed light infantry against them. They began a series of marching retreats into the town. Some had occupied a hill in the town and now argued about what to do next, while others approached with the regulars behind them. The Lincoln militia arrived and joined in the debate. Caution prevailed, and Colonel James Barrett surrendered the town of Concord and led the men across the North Bridge to a hill about a mile north of town, where they could continue to watch the troop movements of the British.

Using the detailed information provided by Loyalist spies, the grenadier companies searched the small town for military supplies. When the grenadiers arrived at Ephraim Jones's tavern, by the jail on the South Bridge road, they found the door barred shut, and Jones refused them entry. According to reports provided by local Tories, Pitcairn knew cannon had been buried on the property, so, holding the tavern keeper at gunpoint, he ordered him to show him where the guns were buried. These turned out to be three massive pieces, firing 24-pound shot, much too heavy to use defensively, but very effective against fortifications, and capable of bombarding the island city of Boston from the mainland.

Colonel Barrett's troops, upon seeing smoke rising from the village square and seeing only a few companies directly below them, agreed to march back towards town from their vantage point on Punkatasset Hill to a lower, closer flat hilltop about 300 yards (300 m) from the North Bridge over the Concord River. This land belonged to Major John Buttrick, who led the Minuteman units under Barrett. It was also their muster (training) field. Two British companies from the 4th and 10th held this position, but they marched in retreat down towards the bridge and yielded the hill to Barrett's men.

Five full companies of Minutemen and five of militia from Acton, Concord, Bedford and Lincoln occupied this hill along with groups of other men streaming in, totaling at least 400 against the light infantry companies from the 4th, 10th, and 43rd Regiments of Foot under Captain Laurie, a force totaling about 90–95 men. Barrett ordered the Massachusetts men to form one long line two deep on the highway leading down to the bridge, and then he called for another consultation. While overlooking North Bridge from the top of the hill (which would after 1793 have a road built on it called Liberty Street), Barrett and the other Captains discussed possible courses of action.

At this moment, they first saw the smoke from the burning gun carriages and barrels rising over Concord, and many thought the regulars had set the town alight. Barrett ordered the men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon. Then he ordered them to advance. Both British companies used as guards were ordered to retreat back across the North Bridge, and one officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance. Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia advanced in column formation on the light infantry, keeping to the highway only, since the highway was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.

The inexperienced Captain Walter Laurie of the 43rd Regiment of Foot, in nominal command of this little detachment, then made a poor tactical maneuver. When he found his summons for help to the grenadiers downtown produced no results, he ordered his men to form positions for &quot;street firing&quot; behind the bridge in a column running perpendicular to the river. This formation was appropriate for sending a large volume of fire into a narrow alley between the buildings of a city, but not for an open path behind a bridge. Confusion reigned as regulars retreating over the bridge tried to form up in the street-firing position of the other troops. Lieutenant William Sutherland, who was in the rear of the formation, saw Laurie's mistake and ordered flankers to be sent out. But he was from a company different from the men under his command, and only four soldiers obeyed him. The remainder tried as best they could in the confusion to follow the orders of the superior officer.

Shots soon rang out and the battle began. The few front rows of colonists, bound by the road, and blocked from forming a line of fire, managed to fire over each others' heads and shoulders at the regulars. The musket balls plunged down out of the sky down into the mass of regular troops. Four of the eight British officers and sergeants at the bridge, leading from the front of their troops as officers did in this era, were wounded by the volley of musketry coming from the British colonists. 

The regulars found themselves trapped in a situation where they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Leaderless, terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy, their spirit broken, never having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled to the safety of the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center.

==Continued Fighting==
The colonists were stunned by their success. No one had actually believed each side would shoot and kill each other. Some advanced; many more retreated; and some went home to see to the safety of their homes and families. Colonel Barrett eventually began to recover control and chose to divide his forces. He moved the militia back to the hilltop 300 yards (270 m) away and sent Major Buttrick with the Minutemen across the bridge to a defensive position on a hill behind a stone wall.

Smith, leader of the British expedition, heard the exchange of fire from his position in the town moments after he had received a request for reinforcements from Laurie. Smith assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead towards the North Bridge himself. As these troops marched, they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them. Smith was concerned about the four companies which had been at Barrett's. Their route to return safely was now gone. Then he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall, and he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers to take a closer look.

These men, unaware of what had happened, marched back from their fruitless search of Barrett's farm. They passed unharmed by Barrett's militia on the muster field and through the tiny battlefield, saw dead and wounded comrades lying on the bridge, including one who looked to them as if he had been scalped, which angered and shocked the British soldiers. They then passed sullenly over the bridge, unharmed by Buttrick's Minutemen. The regulars all returned to the town by 10:30 a.m. Even after a small skirmish, and with superior numbers, the British colonists still did not fire yet unless fired upon, and this time the regulars did nothing to provoke them. The British Army continued to destroy colonial military supplies in the town, ate lunch, reassembled for marching, then left Concord after noon.

As the day wore one, there were more conflicts between the regulars and the colonists. Three British companies were ambushed by the colonists, and the remaining officer even considered surrendering, until a full brigade with artillery of about 1,000 men under the command of Hugh, Earl Percy arrived to rescue them.

The fighting grew more intense as Percy's forces crossed from Lexington into Menotomy. Fresh militia poured gunfire into the British ranks from a distance, and individual homeowners began to fight from their own property. Some homes were also used as sniper positions. It now turned into a soldier's nightmare: house-to-house fighting. 

Percy lost control of his men, and British soldiers began to commit atrocities to repay for the purported scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties at the hands of a distant, often unseen enemy. Based on the word of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and shoot at the column. Percy proceeded to give orders to the flank companies to clear these colonial militiamen out of such places.

Many of the junior officers in the flank parties had difficulty stopping their exhausted, enraged men from killing everyone they found inside these buildings. The British troops crossed the border into Cambridge, and the fight grew more intense. Fresh militia arrived in close array instead of in a scattered formation, and Percy used his two artillery pieces and flankers at a crossroads called Watson's Corner to inflict heavy damage on them.

A large militia force arrived from Salem and Marblehead. They might have cut off Percy's route to Charlestown, but these men halted on nearby Winter Hill and allowed the British to escape. Some accused the commander of this force, Colonel Timothy Pickering, of permitting the troops to pass because he still hoped to avoid war by preventing a total defeat for the regulars.

==Aftermath==
In the morning, Gage awoke to find Boston besieged by a huge militia army, numbering 20,000, which had marched from throughout New England. This time, unlike during the Powder Alarm, the rumors of spilled blood were true, and the Revolutionary War had begun. The militia army continued to grow as surrounding colonies sent men and supplies. The Continental Congress would adopt and sponsor these men into the beginnings of the Continental Army. Even now, after open warfare had started, Gage still refused to impose martial law in Boston. He persuaded the town's selectmen to surrender all private weapons in return for promising that any inhabitant could leave town.

'''Troposphere'''
    
The troposphere begins at the Earth's surface and extends up to 4-12 miles (6-20 km) high varying from the equator to the poles. At the equator it is around 11-12 miles (18-20 km) high, at 50°N and 50°S, 5½ miles and at the poles just under four miles high. The troposphere is the most dense layer of the atmosphere due to it containing 75% of the atmosphere's mass. And is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, small traces of other gases, and almost all of the atmosphere's water vapor. As the gases in this layer decrease with height, the air becomes thinner. Therefore, the temperature in the troposphere also decreases with height. As you climb higher, the temperature drops from about 62°F (17°C) to -60°F (-51°C). However sometimes the temperature does not decrease with height in the troposphere, but increases. Such a situation is known as a temperature inversion. Temperature inversions limit or prevent the vertical mixing of air. Such atmospheric stability can lead to air pollution episodes with air pollutants emitted at ground level becoming trapped underneath the temperature inversion.

The troposphere is the layer where most of the world's weather takes place. Since temperature decreases with altitude in the troposphere, warm air near the surface of the Earth can readily rise, being less  dense than the colder air above it. In fact air molecules can travel to the top of the troposphere and back down again in a just a few days. Such vertical movement or convection of air generates clouds and ultimately rain from the moisture within the air, and gives rise to much of the weather which we experience. The troposphere is capped by the tropopause, a region of stable temperature. Air temperature then begins to rise in the stratosphere. Such a temperature increase prevents much air convection beyond the tropopause, and consequently most weather phenomena, including towering cumulonimbus thunderclouds, are confined to the troposphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Quilting is a sewing method done either by hand, by sewing machine, or by a longarm quilting system. The process uses a needle and thread to join two or more layers of material together to make a quilt. Typical quilting is done with three layers, the top fabric or quilt top, batting or insulating material and backing material. The quilter's hand or sewing machine passes the needle and thread through all layers and then brings the needle back up. The process is repeated across the entire piece where quilting is wanted. A straight or running stitch is commonly used and these stitches can be purely functional or decorative and elaborate.

Another technique for securing the quilt layers is tying. Tying refers to the technique of using thread, yarn or ribbon to pass through all three layers of the quilt at regular intervals. These &quot;ties&quot; hold the layers together during use and especially when the quilt is washed. This method is easier and more forgiving if the quilt is made by hand. Tied quilts are called, depending on the regional area, &quot;lap&quot;, &quot;comfort&quot; or &quot;comforter&quot;, among other names.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Traditional Quilting Processes'''
Traditional quilting is a six-step process that includes: 1) selecting a pattern, fabrics and batting; 2) measuring and cutting fabrics to the correct size to make blocks from the pattern; 3) piecing (sewing cut pieces of fabric together using a sewing machine or by hand to make blocks) blocks together to make a finished &quot;top&quot;; 4) layering the quilt top with batting and backing, to make a &quot;quilt sandwich&quot;; 5) quilting by hand or machine through all layers of the quilt sandwich; and 6) squaring up and trimming excess batting from the edges, machine sewing the binding to the front edges of the quilt and then hand-stitching the binding to the quilt backing. Note: If the quilt will be hung on the wall, there is an additional step: making and attaching the hanging sleeve.

'''Definitions'''
* Piecing: Sewing small pieces of cloth into patterns, called blocks, that are then sewn together to make a finished quilt top. These blocks may be sewn together, edge to edge, or separated by strips of cloth called sashing. Note: Whole cloth quilts typically are not pieced, but are made using a single piece of cloth for the quilt top. 

* Layering: Placing the quilt top right side up atop the batting and the backing, which is right-side out.

* Quilting: Sewing the three quilt layers together, using stitches in decorative patterns, called motifs, or in utilitarian patterns, such as straight lines, using bigger stitches.

* Borders: Typically strips of fabric of various widths added to the perimeter of the pieced blocks to complete the quilt top. Note: borders may also be made up of simple or patterned blocks that are stitched together into a row, before being added to the quilt top.

* Binding: Fabric strips cut on the bias or straight of the grain, sewn together, making a long strip that will fit the perimeter of the quilt, which is typically machine sewn to the front side of the edge of the quilt, folded over, and hand sewn to the back side of the quilt. 

* Quilting: Stitching through all three layers of the quilt sandwich, typically by hand or machine in decorative patterns, which serves three purposes: 1) to secure all three layers to each other, and 2) to add to the beauty and design of the finished quilt, and 3) to trap air within the quilted sections, making the quilt as a whole much warmer than its parts; for example, a single layer or all three layers used separately. Quilting is usually completed by starting from the middle, and moving outward toward the edges of the quilt. Examples: simple or complex geometric grids, &quot;motifs&quot; traced from published quilting patterns or traced pictures, complex repeated designs called ''tessellations,'' or stitching within the seam line itself, i.e., stitching in the ditch. 

Note 1: Quilting can be elaborately decorative, comprising stitching fashioned into complex designs and patterns. The quilter may choose to emphasize and add to the richness of the quilting, by using threads that are multicolored and/or metallic, or that contrast highly to the fabric. Conversely, the quilter may choose to make the quilting disappear, using &quot;invisible&quot; nylon or polyester thread, and stitching in the ditch (in the seam line). Some quilters draw the quilting design on the quilt top before stitching, while others stitch &quot;freehand.&quot; 

Note 2: While the majority of quilt tops are pieced from many smaller patches of fabric (patchwork quilts), in which the patterns of individual blocks, or the pattern created by combining the blocks is the emphasis, whole cloth quilts typically use a single, non-figural piece of fabric and the elaborate quilting is the emphasis. Polished chintz, sateen or other shiny fabrics are often used in whole cloth quilts to aid in emphasizing the intricately detailed quilting stitches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is a guide for anyone who would like to learn how to program a game using the program RPG Maker 2003. It will give you the ability to create maps, make unique characters and items, code special events, and much more. It will introduce every concept (to the best of it's ability) from the blatantly obvious to those much more in depth.

Make sure you don't get confused. This book will probably be of NO help whatsoever for RPG Maker 2000 or RPG Maker VX, as well for any other future or past versions. It specifically focuses on functions within the RPG Maker 2003 version. So before you start, make sure that the version you are using is, indeed, RPG Maker 2003. If not, I recommend you close this book now before you do more harm than good.

It will try its best to give you all of the information needed to create your video game, so good luck, and be the best game maker you can be!

==The Interface==
RPG Maker 2003 is a program to help you make RPGs, so to make it simpler, it created a very simple interface to use. Just about everything you'll need to start is already included with your RPG Maker program CD, but if it isn't, you should be able to download it off of the internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chips sets are one of the biggest pieces of RPG Maker 2003, because without them, you can't create the dungeons or towns your characters will explore. They've got so many interesting aspects about them, an entire section is dedicated to them.

==Uploading==

First, you need to know how to get them onto RPG Maker 2003. First of all, you would open the Resources Catalog. Make sure to click on the ChipSet folder, or you could be importing them to the wrong area, and won't be able to open it. Next, click &quot;Import&quot;, and select the file you would like to import to the game. It will show you a preview of the image, and then after looking at it, you can determine whether you definitely want it in there, or if you'd like a different one instead.

This next part is CRUCIAL. To access your new chipset as a map tileset, you MUST open the Database Catalog. Click on the Tileset tab. From here, you can upload, modify, name, and edit any new or existing maps. To upload your new chipset to be usable as a map tileset, make sure you have enough numbers (on the left hand side of the window) to accompany it. If not, click on the Array Size button, and increase the array by one. Make sure you click on that new number, or you could be replacing an existing map! After you click on it, look to the center of the window. There will be two boxes at the top, one with the label &quot;Name&quot; and the other with the label &quot;Tileset File&quot;. You can name the map tileset or upload the chipset first, since order doesn't matter, as long as they both get done! Click the two dots next to the box under the lable &quot;Tileset File&quot; to choose the file you want as your new map tileset. There! You are (basically) all done with uploading your map!

==Customizing==

Unless, of course, you don't want your characters walking where they aren't supposed to! Before you can use your new map, you have to customize it first. If you look below those two boxes, then you will see another box with a scroll bar containing your uploaded chipset! This is the work area for customizing your new map tileset. This book will explain it all in the best of it's ability.

You are able to edit both the lower layer and the upper layer of the map. The lower layer is presented with three major buttons, a fourth less major button, and a small area for the water tile animation. The upper layer is presented with three major buttons only. Make sure you don't get the two confused, okay?

===Lower Layer===

====Terrain====

The first button on the lower layer tab is the terrain button. By clicking this, you are able to change the terrain of any tile. You can choose the terrain on your right, and change the terrain of the tile by simply clicking on it. You have many terrains to choose from, and can make more if your little heart desires it!
[[Image:RPG001.JPG|left|frame|The Tilesets tab in the database.]]
====Passibility====

The second button on the lower layer tab is the passibility button. This button is probably the most tricky of the buttons shown. It has three possibilities for a tile's passibility. First is the Circle. This means that if a tile is showing this on it, it can be passed from any direction at any time. The second is the Cross. When this is shown above a tile, then it means that that particular tile cannot be passed. Lastly is the Star. This is a specialty marking, and it means that the character can pass BEHIND the tile. For example, if you have a trunk of a tree as a tile, you can make it so the character can pass behind it, like in real life.

====Directional Passibility====

The third button on the lower layer tab is the directional passibility button. Don't get this confused with the second button. This gives specifics for most of the passibilities. For example, the tree trunk from before. If you want your character to be able to walk in front of it, but not head through it to get behind it, then you can change it's directional passibility. It will show you four arrows, from the four main directions your character can move. By clicking on one of the arrows, it will turn into a dot. This means that your character CANNOT move in that direction while it stands on that tile. Removing all of the arrows will be the same as marking it with a Cross. It cannot be passed at all.

====Uniform Terrain====

The button &quot;Set Uniform Terrain&quot; simply means that ALL of the tiles will be set with the same terrain. So if you want this, simply click on the terrain you want it to be, and then click that button. All of the tiles will be transformed into that terrain.

====Water Tile Animation====

The water tile animation area is for the water tiles animations, obviously. You can set how it will be animated, and what speed it should animate at. It will show you a sample tile above it, so you can see how it looks.Now it's time to see the upper layer tab. It's a LOT more simple than the lower layer, and most of the functions are the same, so less explaining is a lot more necessary!

===Upper Layer===

====Passibility====

As with the lower layer, all of the shapes mean the same thing under the passibility button. Circle means you can pass, Cross means you can't, and Star means only from behind.In addition to passibility, it ALSO has directional passibility. This is EXACTLY the same as the lower layer, so please refer to that to find out how it works.

====Counter Flags====

The only difference between the two is the counter flag button. This button allows you to tell it which tiles should act like a counter. Any tile that is told to act like a counter acts in the following: when your character presses the Action button on the counter, and another character or NPC stands on the opposite side, the characters are able to interact with each other. When there is a diamond, it means that it is to act like a counter, and when there isn't a diamond, it shouldn't act like a counter. Very simple.

==Extra Stuff==

Well, that is all there is to know about tilesets. There ARE a couple of special facts about them that will be listed below for everyone's common knowledge, in case you want to make your own from scratch.

*In addition to the Circle, Cross, and Star, there is a FOURTH setting, which is impossible to access. It is the Square, which makes the tile act like a wall, where you can pass horizontally, but not vertically. EDIT: It is not impossible to access the square, you have to put the tiles in a special area. I, however, have not quite found the area.
*Each tile for a tileset is a 16X16 pixel square. One tileset (as the program will recognize) is composed of 16 rows of 30 chips. The total image size should be 480X256 pixels.
*It only accepts two types of images: PNG image types, and XYZ image types. It will also only recognize those of the correct size as well.
*All pictures need to be in 256 colors, or else it won't be accepted. RM2k3 (RPG Maker 2003) will also accept 256 color bitmaps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, now that you know about the outline for the maps, let's introduce you to the maps themselves. They have a lot of features that may come in useful for any game-creators out there, and this book will try it's best to introduce you to them all.

Maps are the basis of a game; without them, your characters have nowhere to start, and nowhere to go. They have nothing to interact with, and, all in all, your game would be a very boring one.

==Organization==

Maps can be organized in the Map Folder area. This area is where you will select the maps you will work on in the Map Editor. Naming them is important, because you might be making a hundred or more maps, and you'll need to know which is which. organizing them is also important, as several maps can be grouped according to their placement in the game you are creating.

==Creating a New Map==

There is a window that opens when you create a new map (you can create a new one by right clicking the main folder or any existing map or folder and click &quot;New Map&quot;). This book will explain everything that can be found on that window.
NOTE: You can also open this window by right clicking the map you want to edit, and clicking &quot;Map Properties&quot;.

===Name===

This box is where you name your map. Make sure it's something you can recognize, and serves to summarize what the map is about. It's crucial that you know what your own maps are for.

===Tileset===

This box is where you select the tileset you want for your map. You can choose any of the ones that you have uploaded and coded (look at [[RPG_Maker_2003/ChipSets|Tileset]]).

===Dimensions===

These boxes are for the dimensions of your map. They can enlarge or shrink your map to any size that you need, but they do have minimums and maximums of 20X15 and 500X500, respectively. The first number refers to the number of tiles across, and the second refers to the number of tiles going up and down.

===Wrapping===

This simply refers to whether you can walk across the edge of a map and appear on the other side. If you activate Vertical Wrapping, when you walk off the top of bottom of the map, you'll keep going down, but from the top of the screen. It's the same for Horizontal Wrapping. And the Both selection just applies both Vertical and Horizontal Wrapping to your map. This is useful for World Maps to make it seem as if your map is an actual globe.

===Enemy Encounters===

This area is for any enemies you want your characters encountering on your map. Simply right click or double click on the first spot on the box, and insert whatever enemy you want on that map.

===Encounter Rate===

This box is to determine how often you want the monsters you inserted in the Enemy Encounters area to appear. The lower the number is, the less often they will appear. Conversedly, the higher the number is, the more often they will appear.

===Settings===

This contains several smaller areas. First is the &quot;Use Parallax Background&quot; option. This simply means that if there are blank areas on your map (this will be explained later), it will be replaced instead with a picture of your choice as a background. This is useful for areas like in an airship or in space. Your choice. If you activate this, the other options become available. You can choose your background in the box immediately below it. Simply click the &quot;set&quot; button, and pick which picture you want as your Parallax background. After you choose your background, then you can choose if you want it to scroll or not. Choosing a horizontal scroll means that you can have it scroll horizontally. If you don't choose auto-scroll, it means that as the character moves, the background will scroll. Choosing auto-scroll means that even if the character stays still, the background will move. As with the encounter rate, the lower the number for speed, the slower it is, and the higher it is, the faster it moves.

===BGM===

This stands for Background Music. It has three options: Same as Parent Map, Entrust to Event, and Specify. If you choose Same as Parent Map, then the map will have the same BGM as the map that it is beneath. For example, if you right click on an existing map and choose a new map, then the map you clicked on would be the parent map. Next is Entrust to Event. This simply means that if you have an event that activates BGM, then it will acknowledge that, and not mess with it. Events will be discussed in a later chapter. Last is the Specify setting. This means that you choose which BGM that this specific map will have.

===Battle Background===

This option is for the background that appears behind the monsters and characters when you enter a random encounter. It has three options you can choose: Same as Parent Map, Use Terrain Settings, and Specify. If you choose Same as Parent Map, then it will use the same Battle Background that is used in the parent map. If the parent map doesn't specify a particular battle background, then it will automatically use the second choice. Use Terrain Settings means that whatever terrains you chose for a specific tile (see [[RPG_Maker_2003/ChipSets|Tileset]]), it will use the battle background that you chose for that specific terrain (this will be discussed in a later section below). Lastly is the Specify setting. It is exactly the same as the BGM setting. You have to tell it which battle background to use whenever the characters experience a random encounter.

===Teleport===

This means you can allow or forbid the ability to teleport out of the map. You have three choices. Once again, you have the As in Parent option, you have the Allow option, and the Forbid option. Choosing the first one means that it will have the same setting as the parent map. Choosing the second means that you allow it, and the third means you forbid it, as in their names. The next three has the same options, so this book will forego the trouble of writing it out again.

===Escape===

This means you can allow or forbid the ability to escape. This is NOT the same as teleporting. This means that you can teleport out of it, but not to an entirely unrelated map. As with a dungeon, you escape out of the dungeon to the entrance, but no farther.

===Save===

This means you can allow or forbid saving in that map. Allowing means that the save option in the main menu is available, and forbidding makes it unaccessible.

==Random Dungeon Generator==

This is a very special feature, allowing the program itself generate a dungeon for you. It has several options which will be explained to the best of this book's ability. To find it make a new map, the in the top right hand corner it says &quot;Use random Dungeon Generator&quot; tick the box if you'd like to use it.

===The Dungeon Generator Guidelines===

This area is a set of options that tell the program how to make the dungeon. You can choose whether or not you want your dungeon to have a Single Winding Passage, Rooms linked with Passages, a Maze-like Passage Structure, or an Open Room with Obstacles. Also, it has and option of whether or not to surround the map with wall tiles. This means if it should make the map look more realistic, and have the wall tiles shown from respective angles.

====Single Winding Passage==== 

This is an option that makes, as in its' name, a single winding passage. Sometimes, it could overlap itself, but it is usually very simple, and starts at one place and ends at another. You are also able to change the width of the passages using the Passage Granularity option. You can make a 1X1 tile width, or a 2X2 tile width. The only difference there is the width of the passage. Nothing else.

====Open Room with Obstacles====

This is an option that uses the obstacles you choose at the bottom and places them randomly throughout an open room. This is by far one of the least successful ways of making a map, unless the map is very small.

===Tile Selection Area===

This area allows you to choose tiles for the dungeon generator to use. Make sure to choose carefully, because it may not look as good otherwise!

*Ceiling - This is the tile it will use as the ceiling. In other words, it will be the tile that surrounds all of the passages and rooms.

*Lower Wall - This is the tile it will use as the lower wall, or if you don't want an upper wall, as the main wall.

*Upper Wall - If you choose to use it, this will couple the Lower Wall, and create a combination wall. It's good to use if you want to make a shadow effect.

*Floor A, B, and C - B and C are optional floors, but A is not. You can choose whichever tile to use as the floor. If you want more than one floor, then you can make B and C active, and create a multi-floor tiled dungeon.

*Obstacle A, B, and C - Once again, like the Floors, you have to have an Obstacle A, but B and C are up to you. These are the obstacles that will be used in the fourth option. It's not highly recommended to use the random dungeon generator for the placement of obstacles, because it repeats too much. It is much better to place obstacles by hand for that personalized touch.

==Layers==

Finally, we have the layers to talk about. The layers are the crux of the maps, as the maps are the crux for the game. The layers give the map it's flavor, so to speak. Without them, maps would seem too boring, and in fact, there would be only one.

First is the Lower Layer. This is the main layer that you use to make floors, walls, ceilings, and most other landscapes. You usually want to create the map using this first.

Second is the Upper Layer. This layer gives obstacles and objects for interaction. This gives the Lower Layer its detail, and allows the characters to have a real journey!

Last is the Event Layer, the most important layer of them all. This allows your characters to interact with NPCs, with chests, objects, doors, and other things. It allows music to play in the background, characters to speak, and the ability to teleport from map to map. Events do many things for the game, and without them, your game will just be a game where characters walk and do battle without a story line. Events will be explained more in the Tutorials chapter.

Well, that's all there is to talk about maps. This book has given all it could to make sure you have all the knowledge for maps. Onwards we go!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, I decided to start a good WikiBook on the program RPG Maker 2003 because, upon searching the books in existence, I couldn't find but one book on it, and personally, I thought that it could've done a little better. I will be coming with updates every so often, because I work on it everyday, and I try to get all of my information right by testing it with the program and looking at the program.

Hope you enjoy it!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
[http://brightkite.com/ BrightKite ] provides a service to micro-blog your location and message to a service to geocode the address, map it, find other tweeters nearby and forward to other micro-blogs.

However for UK users the service lacks the availability of an SMS service. The following scripts provide a basic SMS tracker service, allowing a user to text an address and a message to an SMS service and see that location on a generated map. This simple application does not provide the social aspects of BrightKite, being confined to creating a simple track.

== Implementation ==

=== Dependencies ===
==== eXist-db Modules ====
* xmldb - to update the track
* datetime - for date formatting
* util - serialize to convert XML to CDATA

==== Other ====
* an SMS two-way service
* GoogleGeocoding service
* kml-based mapping such as GoogleMap or GoogleEarth

== The Track structure  ==

Each track is represented as a single XML file, containing a  unique name, a title, one or more mobile phone numbers and a list of events.  Each event is time-stamped and contains the original address, its latitude and longitude when geo-coded and a message. A local namespace is used for the XML data and for associated functions. Full address geo-coding is not supported in the UK due to copyright restrictions on full addresses and postcodes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;track xmlns=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/exist/geo&quot; &gt;
    &lt;name&gt;wiki&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;mobile&gt;44771234578&lt;/mobile&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Demo Track&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;entries&gt;
         &lt;entry date=&quot;2008-06-12T09:56:08.593Z&quot;&gt;
            &lt;address&gt;bristol parkway station&lt;/address&gt;
            &lt;location latitude=&quot;53.580320&quot; longitude=&quot;-0.683640&quot; ambiguous=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;message&gt;Waiting for the paddington train&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry date=&quot;2008-06-12T10:30:51.454Z&quot;&gt;
            &lt;address&gt;swindon&lt;/address&gt;
            &lt;location latitude=&quot;51.558418&quot; longitude=&quot;-1.781985&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;message&gt;Nice empty train&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;/entry&gt;
        &lt;entry date=&quot;2008-06-12T10:51:12.429Z&quot;&gt;
            &lt;address&gt;didcot parkway&lt;/address&gt;
            &lt;location latitude=&quot;51.610994&quot; longitude=&quot;-1.242799&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;message&gt;Grey and its been raining&lt;/message&gt;
        &lt;/entry&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

== In-bound messages ==

Inbound messages have the structure:

&lt;pre&gt;
   geo {address} ! {message}
&lt;/pre&gt;

SMS messages are sent to the UWE SMS two-way service described in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery/String_Analysis#SMS_service here].  The router uses the first word to route the message to the associate service, in this case track2sms.xq.  This service is invoked viat HTTP, passing the prefix ('''prefix'''), the originating mobile number ('''from'')  and the text of the message ('''text''') following the prefix.

The script uses the originating mobile number to find the associated track.  If there is one,  the message is parsed into the address and message text. The address is passed to the Google geocoding service.  If the address is recognised, a new event is created and appended to the rest of the events in the track and a confirmation returned to the originator (via the SMS two-way service).

   let $response := doc($url)
   for $placemark in $response//kml:Placemark
       let $point := $placemark/kml:Point/kml:coordinates
       let $latlong := tokenize($point,&quot;,&quot;)
       return 
              &lt;geo:location latitude=&quot;{$latlong[2]}&quot;   longitude=&quot;{$latlong[1]}&quot;/&gt;

then 
   let $address  := 
       if (contains($text,$sep))
       then normalize-space(substring-before($text,$sep))
       else normalize-space($text)
   let $message := substring-after($text,$sep)
   let $location := geo:geocode($address)
   return
       if (exists($location) and count($location)=1)
       then 
             let $update :=

&lt;/source&gt;

== Generating the Map ==

The track is identified by name and a KML file of the events on the track is generated.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare namespace  geo =  &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/exist/geo&quot;;
declare namespace kml = &quot;http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1&quot; ;

declare function geo:entry-to-kml($entry  as element(geo:entry)) as element(Placemark) {
   let $location := $entry/geo:location
   let $latlong := concat($location/@latitude,&quot; &quot;,$location/@longitude)
   let $dt := datetime:format-dateTime($entry/@date,&quot;yy/MM/dd HH:mm&quot;)
   let $popup := 
   &lt;div  xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;{string($entry/geo:address)}&lt;/h3&gt;
       &lt;p&gt; {string($entry/geo:message)} &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
   return 
     &lt;Placemark&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;{$dt} &amp;#160;{string($entry/geo:title)}&lt;/name&gt;
         &lt;description&gt;
           {util:serialize($popup,&quot;method=xhtml&quot;)}
         &lt;/description&gt;
         &lt;Point&gt;
             &lt;coordinates&gt;
                 {string-join(($location/@longitude,$location/@latitude),&quot;,&quot;)}
             &lt;/coordinates&gt;
         &lt;/Point&gt;
   &lt;/Placemark&gt;
};


declare option exist:serialize  &quot;method=xml indent=yes 
     media-type=application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml&quot;; 

declare variable  $name := request:get-parameter(&quot;name&quot;,());
declare variable $track := //geo:track[geo:name=$name];

let $dummy := response:set-header('Content-Disposition',concat('inline;filename=',$name,'.kml;'))
return
&lt;kml xmlns=&quot;http://earth.google.com/kml/2.1&quot;  &gt;
&lt;Folder&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;{$name}&lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;{$track/geo:title}&lt;/title&gt;
      { for $entry in $track//geo:entry
        return  geo:entry-to-kml($entry)
     }
&lt;/Folder&gt;
&lt;/kml&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Example Map ==

[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Tracker/map.xq?name=wiki Google Map]

Note that one address has been miscoded but the feedback allowed the address to be changed and resent.  

== To do ==

# edit track to remove or correct  bad geo-coding
# add events from a browser

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Short Biography==

My name is Rob, and I was born on Long Island on March 15, 1991.  I have remained on Long Island for the rest of my life and am currently attending high school.  I am interested in Math and science and hope to improve Wikipedia by editing any mistakes/typos I see.  I have become a participant of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Physics]].

==My Future==

I hope to go to a four year college to study [[Physics]] as well as other areas in [[Math]] and [[Science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Prefered attribution styles==
The smallest attribution that is acceptable (if space is painfully tight) is my alias, &quot;'''Willscrlt'''&quot;, which is generally (but not 100%) unique across the Internet; it would also be very nice if you could hyperlink my alias to &quot;'''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;http://willscrlt.com/&lt;/span&gt;'''&quot; or to my Wikimedia Commons profile, &quot;'''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Willscrlt&lt;/span&gt;'''&quot; to eliminate any ambiguity. You could also use my real name, &quot;Will Murray&quot;, but you must further identify ''which'' Will Murray by either providing my website address, &quot;'''Will Murray (&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;http://willscrlt.com/&lt;/span&gt;)'''&quot;, or my alias, &quot;'''Will Murray (“Willscrlt”)'''&quot;. Combining all of that together, along with a link to the source material, results in my '''''preferred attribution''''' given here:

{{ #switch: {{lc:{{{Required|{{{required|y}}}}}}}} | n | no = The above attributions are not required, but they are really appreciated! }} You may alter the text or reformat the attribution to match layout or other standards, but please include as much relevant information as you can. Hyperlinks should be active whenever possible.


==Citing dates and versions==
Generally you should cite the specific version of the wiki page, image, or other material since wikis are frequently updated and the information you are referencing may change or even disappear. In MediaWiki (the software that powers sites like [[m:w:Main Page|Wikipedia]], [[m:b:Main Page|Wikibooks]], and [[m:commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]], the date that the resource was last modified is  shown at the bottom of every page. Resources also have a link to a &quot;''permanent version''&quot; (also called a &quot;''permanent link''&quot; on several sites). These permanent version links (or &quot;permalinks&quot;) link directly to the exact revision of the resource as it exists at that moment in time. Even if somebody completely changes the material later, by using a permalink, your citation still makes perfect sense to anyone following that link in the future.


==Bibliographical citation styles==
If you wish to cite my work for educational, technical, or professional publication, one of the following formats may be more appropriate. All of these would satisfy any attribution requirements that might be required to reuse the work.
* I am not an expert on citations, styles change over time, and free style guide resources occasionally disagree with each other on some of the finer points of formatting. I have no need or desire to purchase each of the style guides below to verify that everything is 100% correct, so use this as a general guide only. Chances are, if you need to use one of these styles, you probably know better than I how it should be formatted. If you spot errors, please [[{{#ifeq: {{ns:project}} | Commons ||commons:}}User talk:Willscrlt|let me know]] so I can fix them.
* If you are citing a collaborative work (i.e., one where multiple people contributed to the finished product, as is the case on many Wikipedia and Wikibooks pages, replace my name with &quot;'''{{SITENAME}} contributors'''&quot; in the examples below.
* Be sure to read the section on [[#Citing dates and versions|citing dates and versions]] to better understand how to cite the correct modification dates and use permalinks.
* The section headings link to the best free style guide resource I could find for each style. [http://www.library.kent.edu/page/10603 Kent State University Library] has links to many useful resources. Another useful reference is SourceAid's [http://www.sourceaid.com/citationbuilder/ Citation Builder], which helps generate MLA, APA, CMS, and CSE citations semi-automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Virtual Environments: Second Life''' ==

by '''Patricia Glogowski''' '''[http://monitorhypothesis.typepad.com]'''

This wikibook chapter discusses Second Life, a virtual environment. The first part of this article, Introduction, gives a brief introduction to virtual environments and to the features of Second Life.  The second part of this article, Characteristics of Second Life, discusses the theoretical features of virtual environments. The third part, Uses of Second Life &amp; Projects in Second Life, focuses on uses of Second Life for social activism, education, and language teaching and learning. The final part of this article, Criticisms, Problems, and Limitations, includes a discussion of the most serious social problems occurring in Second Life and the constraints that individuals face when using Second Life.

== '''Introduction''' ==

'''Virtual Environments'''

Virtual environments are complex visual and audio-based, immersive environments where individuals interact with one another via avatars or digital representation of themselves. These environments are quite distinct from Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG). Whereas MMORPG are games where content is designed by developers and consumed by players, virtual environments are places where residents co-construct physical and social content through socialization and collaboration. The content of many virtual environments is co-constructed collaboratively by residents through creativity, invention, taking on identities, and experimentation. “Practices of the participants, their actions, conversations, movements, and exchanges come to define the world and continually infuse it with new meanings” (Thomas &amp; Brown, 2007).


'''What is Second Life?'''

One of the more popular virtual environments that has emerged recently is Second Life. Second Life was launched on June 23, 2003 by Linden Labs. It is widely popular with individuals in their early 30s (Generation X), and, according to the Kzero research group, it has 13 million registered accounts, which makes it one of the largest virtual environments (Virtual Worlds). Although residents do not need to own land, some purchase or lease parcels of land from Second Life real estate developers who, in turn, purchase the real estate from Linden Labs. Plots of virtual real estate in Second Life can range in price from $100 to $1000 US or more. Linden Labs lists three types of land: mainland regions, islands (private regions), and open spaces. Residents who are interested in buying land, bid for it on the Second Life auction (Types of Land ). Land is also available for rent; the prices are US $50 per region per day (Types of Land). Real estate trading as well as other economic activities that take place in Second Life are done in Second Life currency, the Linden Dollar.


'''Main Grid and Teen Grid'''

Second Life consists of the following parts: the Main Grid where adult residents create their spaces and the Teen Grid which is designed for residents aged 13 -18 only. Adults who want to work with teenagers in the Teen Grid need special clearance to enter the Teen Grid and are restricted to their approved projects. Adult residents entering the Teen Grid need to create a new avatar which can be used on the Teen Grid only; if they use the avatar from the Main Grid, they cannot return to it once they leave or communicate with other adult avatars on the Main Grid.


'''Ownerships of Content'''

In January 2007, Linden Labs released its client source code under the GPL free software license (Embracing the Inevitable) which made it possible for residents to own the content they create. The physical content of the space, the ownership of objects, buildings, natural settings, or clothing created by the residents is in the hands of the residents, which means residents can own, sell, or give away the objects that they have created. They commonly license them under the Creative Commons. The possibility to own objects created in Second Life is one of the main features that distinguishes Second Life and other such similar environments from the MMMORG games where players do not own the content.

== '''Second Life Characteristics''' ==


'''Distributed Networks'''

Second Life is characterized by distributed networks as its residents are geographically, demographically, and generationally dispersed. Thomas &amp; Brown (2007) also suggest that the distributed networks are, at the same time, co-present as, for any interaction to take place, residents’ avatars are in the same space.


'''Participatory Culture'''

According to Ondrejka (2008), another characteristic that makes Second Life unique is its participatory culture (culture of interacting, sharing, and collaborating) characterized by innovation and creativity. Participatory culture is integral for Second Life to function as the social and physical content of the environment is collaboratively authored, preserved, modified, and maintained by its residents (Robbins qtd. in Arreguin, 2007) through the process of what Yowell (Yowell, qtd. in Arreguin, 2007) and Thomas &amp; Brown (2007) call “networked imagination.” To explain this further, it is the collective or network imagination of Second Life residents that leads to the creation of urban and natural spaces where the residents congregate, and it is the collective imagination of the residents that results in defining the purpose to meet in those spaces. These purposes can range from social gatherings to educational initiatives such as lectures or workshops.


'''Social Interaction'''

Because it is the residents of Second Life who are the creators and developers of the physical and social content, the quality and complexity of this virtual environment depend entirely on residents’ agency - their willingness, frequency, and quality of interactions. It is up to the residents to decide to what degree they become involved in this space. This, according to Ondrejka (2008), largely depends on residents’ needs, desires, and constraints. It is also worthy to point out that, in contrast to interactions in other Web 2.0 applications, such as blogging, wikis, or microblogging which are sequential, the interaction in Second Life and other similar virtual environments is always synchronous.


'''Learning as a Social Practice'''

Because the content is co-constructed by its residents, Second Life is an environment where learning occurs through social interaction. Ondrejka (2008) labels it as peer-to-peer pedagogy learning which is modelled on the apprenticeship model put forward by Vygotsky (Vygotsky, 1978) and which takes place in communities of practice created by learners (Wenger, 1998). “Rather than requiring learners to become proficient in all Second Life skills, students are encouraged to become dependent on each other’s talents and strengths to the point of leading and teaching each other” (Arreguin, 2007). Learning in Second Life is predominantly driven by the needs of the individual. Ondrejka (2008) points out that there is no pre-set curriculum and that learning is regulated primarily by the needs of the learners. According to Robbins (Robbins qtd. in Arreguin, 2007) knowledge is pulled by the learners rather than pushed at a student. Robbins also stresses that the roles of the learner and instructor change as a result of this; the learner becomes an instructor and the instructor becomes a learner. Learning in Second Life occurs through formal and informal instances that include conventions, conferences, workshops and demonstrations organized and led by more experienced residents or through informal peer-to-peer synchronous voice or text chats. Learning in Second Life is also supported by exchange of knowledge, expertise, and information through a mash-up of technologies that are used along with Second Life. Thus, Second Life residents continue to learn by interacting outside of Second Life by writing blogs, collaborating on wikis, joining Facebook groups, exchanging short comments on microblogging applications such as Twitter, participating in conversations on listservs, sharing images on Flickr, and sharing resources on del.icio.us or other social networking sites.



== '''Uses of Second Life &amp; Projects in Second Life''' ==


'''Social Activism'''


'''Homelessness'''

Since its launch in 2003, Second Life has been used for various purposes: social activism, politics, education, and professional development. An example of social activism in Second Life was a project that aimed to alert Second Life residents to the plight of homeless children living in developing countries. The project was launched by The Messengers of Peace Association (Mensajeros de la Paz), a Non-Governmental Organization based in Spain that works with needy and socially-disadvantaged groups in developing countries. This NGO created a homeless teenager avatar in December 2007. The avatar did not own any land and was living in a cardboard box stuffed with newspapers and a sign that said, “Help a child have a second opportunity in his First Life“ (Doctorow, 2006). The intention behind creating this avatar was to use the newest technologies to alert wider audiences to the plight of poor and disadvantaged people. Salvador Dinez, one of the designers of the project stated, “We think Second Life and other forms of new technologies can be a great way to connect with young people and make them a little more conscious about the huge population in the real world needing help, and it doesn't cost much to guarantee the future of another human being” (Doctorow, 2006).


'''Labour Protests'''

Another example of social activism was a labour strike organized in September 2007 in Second Life by Italian workers working at an IBM plant in Italy who were protesting the $1, 377 pay cut. The labour protest took place at the IBM corporate campus and marketing site in Second Life that the company’s UK sector has been using for developmental purposes (Au, 2007a).


'''Politics'''

The decision by the government of Sweden to open its embassy in Second Life with the view to promote tourism and travel (Sweden) was a perfect illustration of how important technology has become as a tool to reach wider audiences. Yet another example of political activism was the opening of the France's New Front Party Headquarters in Second Life. This met with violent protests from the Second Life residents that involved virtual throwing of grenades, detonations, and setting buildings on fire (Au, 2007b).

It has become clear that Second Life is an important place for social activism aimed at addressing real life issues that have been traditionally dealt with in real life. Companies, governmental, and non-governmental institutions increasingly seek to establish their presence in this virtual environment as they realize that they can reach more geographically, demographically, and socially distributed audiences.


'''Education'''


'''Universities and Colleges'''

Many universities and colleges have established their presence in Second Life either with pre-built campuses or by creating opportunities for students to engage in project-based learning. One of the examples is the initiative, “Stepping into History,” developed by Alliance Library System in cooperation with Learning Times. The project was developed to explore the possibilities of teaching history in an interactive way with live talks and interaction with historical characters in re-created historical settings. This project is an example of shifting students' learning from text-based knowledge acquisition to learning in a highly-interactive multimedia environment where students can build their knowledge via image, voice, and live, synchronous interactive exercises.

Other initiatives include the Ohio University Virtual Lab which does research on Second Life or University of Cincinnati Second Life Community, just to name a few. Individual educators have also started various initiatives to create educational spaces which are devoted to education. A good example of that are the Islands of jokaydia, a self-funded group of islands that provides a space for educators to collaborate and explore how virtual worlds can be used in education and the arts.

Another example of educational development is the newly launched Education Grid or the Global Kids Digital Media Project.


'''Medicine and Sciences'''

Medical schools are using Second Life for medical stimulations. One example of that is the Ann Myers Medical Center. The purpose of establishing medical schools in Second Life is to train medical students and nurses through case presentations which are expensive or dangerous to perform in real life. Medical research and visualization of disorders have also been documented in Second Life. An example of that is the Visual Virtual Documentation of Schizophrenia which aims to familiarize medical students with the details of the illness. Research institutions have also established scientific research centres to create immersive science learning experiences. Some of the examples include projects developed by Drexel University and the University of Denver.


'''Language Teaching and Learning and Professional Development'''

Language teaching has not lagged behind in establishing its presence in Second Life. The British Council has developed a number of initiatives to build places for English language instruction in Second Life . The Second Life English group started by a language teacher in Germany has established itself at the English Village and has been operating since 2006. Its mandate is to provide free resources and support to language teachers and learners. A real language school, the Avatar Languages School, based entirely in Second Life offers English language classes in Second Life.
The annual SLanguages conference (hosted within Second Life) is a 24-hour variety of workshops, PowerPoint sessions and discussions, field trips, and hands-on building activities. The conference took place in May 2008 and will be held again in May 2009. The event focuses on the use of Second Life and other 3D virtual worlds in language education.

== '''Criticisms, Limitations, and Problems''' ==


'''Financial Constraints'''

One of the main criticisms of Second Life is the financial cost of using this environment. Establishing a permanent presence in Second Life requires substantial financial investment, especially recently when the land prices have increased (Linden, 2006). Land prices vary depending on the region and whether one owns or rents. In addition to land prices, residents also pay monthly maintenance fees that range from $5 US to $195 US depending on the size of their land (Knowledge Base). Linden Labs also states on its website, “To purchase land in Second Life, you must have a Premium account, current payment information on file, and your account must be in good standing (i.e. not delinquent). You may also be required to have a clean disciplinary record. Linden Lab reserves the right to refund your purchase if you do not meet our minimum criteria for land ownership” (Knowledge Base).

Another prohibitive issue that limits the use of Second Life are the hardware requirements needed to run the Second Life client software. This translates into a substantial economic investment that many individuals or educational institutions cannot afford. 


'''Educational Constraints and Criticisms''' 

In addition to these financial constraints, using Second Life for educational or other purposes involves a steep learning curve that involves learning how to function in the environment and how to build the physical content. In addition to basic skills, building educational spaces and bringing learners into Second Life requires creativity, time, patience, and innovation. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the content created by residents will be educationally valuable. A further criticism of teaching in Second Life is the misguided pedagogy of using Second Life and other newest technologies to teach in old ways; often it’s the traditional, teacher-centred, unidirectional teaching transferred into a new environment. 


'''Ethical Problems'''


'''Misbehaving, Virtual Vandalism, and Griefing''' 

Social misbehaving, virtual vandalism, and what’s commonly known as griefing are the most common social problems in Second Life. Those who engage in griefing are called Griefers. “Griefers are so-called because they create grief. Their antics are designed to interrupt proceedings in virtual worlds and games usually for no other reason than because they can. Attacks … are triggered by a program code that generates self-replicating objects. Much like email spam, these “griefspawn” attacks can chew up system resources and slow down performance. They can sometimes even trigger network crashes” (Jardin, 2006). In 2006, a virtual assault by griefers took place on the virtual estate of a self-proclaimed virtual millionaire, Anshe Chung (Ailin Graef RL). According to the news report, in a staged, virtual protest, “A torrent of pixelated male genitals rained upon the victim” (Second Life). Another example of griefing was cited by Michael J. Bugeja, Director of the School of Journalism and Communication at Iowa State University, who gave an example of cyber-shooting at the Ohio University virtual campus in Second Life. “Last May, in the wake of the shootings at Virginia Tech, a visiting avatar entered the university's Second Life campus and fired at other avatars” (Bugeja, 2007 ). 


'''Sex-based Economy''' 

The most serious accusation and criticism against Second Life is ethical. Most Second Life land is used for recreational purposes where residents engage in the economy-based activities that include gambling, nightclub hopping, and sexual activities and exploitation. One example of that is a news report ran by a Hawaii television station that described a single mother who amassed a fortune running virtual brothels (Pai, 2007). Another news report reported a number of incidents of sexual exploitations (Twohey, 2008). 


'''Child Pornography'''

Other accusations that have surfaced were those of child pornography. In response to that, Linden Labs issued a statement condemning all illegal activities in Second Life and warning about strict and irreversible punishments. In their response, “Accusations regarding child pornography in Second Life”, Linden Labs indicated that sex involving minors and child pornography constitute illegal activity. They also state that residents are responsible for the content of the space and that such illegal activities are not tolerated. The punishment for two avatars that were photographed engaging in sexual activity (one avatar appeared to be a minor) was a permanent ban from Second Life (Linden, 2007). 


'''Criminal Activity in Second Life''' 

Michael Bugeja further points out to the liability that educators face when they bring learners into Second Life. “What about a complaint by a student who agrees to meet the teacher's avatar outside of class but in-world and then witnesses or engages in an unwanted virtual act? Or a claim of emotional distress filed by a student exposed to virtual shootings or any number of sexist, racist, homophobic, or offensive avatar behaviours? Who is responsible?” (Bugeja, 2007). Many questions have also arisen as to what constitutes and what does not constitute criminal activity in virtual space and whether criminal activity in virtual space can be or should be considered the same as it is in real life. Regina Lynn, a journalist for Wired, in her discussion of virtual rape, for example, makes the case against it. She states that virtual rape although traumatic cannot be treated as real-life rape (Lynn, 2007).


'''Punishment '''

Linden Labs’ response to the unwanted sexual acts and other criminal activities in Second Life includes a series of punishments that range from warnings, suspension, and then banishment for life from Second Life. For the purpose of suspension, Linden Labs has created a prison stimulator, “The Corn Field,” where misbehaving avatars are locked up. The virtual prison contains one-way teleport terminal which does not allow an avatar to escape since communication to the Main Grid of Second Life is permanently cut off (Walsh, 2006 ).



== '''Conclusions''' ==

Second Life is a complex, audio-visual, immersive environment where individuals represented by their avatars, take on new identities and create physical and social content in which they interact with others. Individuals’ identities are replicated from real life, augmented, or significantly modified. An increasing number of researchers agree that engagement in virtual environments is supplemental to real life presence and virtual identities are supplemental to real life identities. Many activities taking place in Second Life serve educational and other valuable purposes. Many institutions have established their presence in Second Life to create highly immersive educational experiences that are too expensive, dangerous, or not feasible in real life.

However, social activities in Second Life have not always been positive. Some residents engage in violent, sexually explicit, and morally questionable behaviour. Although certain measures have been taken by Linden Labs to assure security and safety, this newly emerging social environment has not been yet thoroughly regulated, and its safety and security largely depend on the residents and their intentions. While Second Life has shown a lot of potential as a virtual venue for valuable activities, including education and social activism, some of its drawbacks cannot be ignored. It remains to be seen whether Second Life can indeed be the next great tool in education.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to detect duplicate terms as the user types within a field of a form.

== Method ==
We will create a form that sends a request to the server each time a letter is typed into a field.  The form will call a ReST web service and pass the current term as a parameter.

== Sample XQuery ==
The following query can be used on the server to detect duplicates.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare namespace request=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/request&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xml media-type=text/xml indent=yes&quot;;
let $term-name := request:get-parameter('term-name', '')
let $collection := '/db/terms'
return
if (not($term-name)) then
   &lt;error&gt;
      &lt;message&gt;Error: term-name argument required&lt;/message&gt;
   &lt;/error&gt;
else
&lt;result&gt;{
  if (collection($collection)/Term[TermName/text()=$term-name or Abbreviation/text()=$term-name])
    then &lt;true/&gt;
    else &lt;false/&gt;
}&lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

This query takes a single parameter and returns a true or false element.

'''$BASENAME/xqueries/term-exists.xq?term-name=Product'''

If the term exists in the database it will return the following:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;result&gt;
   &lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== XForms Application ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html
   xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
   xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;
   xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; &gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
       &lt;title&gt;Duplicate Detection Example&lt;/title&gt;
       &lt;xf:model&gt;
           &lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;term&quot;&gt;
               &lt;data&gt;
                   &lt;term-name&gt;Product&lt;/term-name&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/xf:instance&gt;
            &lt;xf:submission id=&quot;check-for-duplicate&quot; method=&quot;get&quot; 
                    action=&quot;term-exists.xq&quot; 
                    instance=&quot;term&quot; replace=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/xf:model&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Check Term&lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;xf:input ref=&quot;term-name&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xf:label&gt;Term: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
          &lt;/xf:input&gt;
          &lt;xf:submit submission=&quot;check-for-duplicate&quot;&gt;
               &lt;xf:label&gt;Check for Dups&lt;/xf:label&gt;
          &lt;/xf:submit&gt;
     &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Now we have a simple XForms that calls a web service and returns a true/false record.  Our next step is to make this test occur in the background as the user types and display a warning message as a duplicate has been detected.

== Adding Character-by-Character Testing ==
Now we have two tasks.  We need to fire off the event to the server as the user types and we need to bring the information back without interrupting the user.

First we want to add an event to the input field that sends a message each time a character is typed into the input field:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:input ref=&quot;term-name&quot; incremental=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:label &gt;Term: &lt;/xf:label&gt;
   &lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-value-changed&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:send submission=&quot;check-for-duplicate&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/xf:input&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Capture of Fort Ticonderoga==
===Concerns===
Even before shooting in the American Revolutionary War started, American Revolutionaries were concerned about Fort Ticonderoga. The fort was a valuable asset for several reasons. First of all, within its walls were a number of cannons and massive artillery, something the Americans had in short supply. Secondly, the fort was situated in the strategically important Lake Champlain valley, the route between the rebellious Thirteen Colonies and the British-controlled Canadian provinces. After the war began at the Battle of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the Americans decided to seize the fort before it could be reinforced by the British, who might then use the fort to stage attacks on the American rear. It is unclear who first proposed capturing the fort: the idea has been credited to John Brown, Benedict Arnold, and Ethan Allen, among others.

===The Capture===
Two independent expeditions to capture Ticonderoga—one out of Massachusetts and the other from Connecticut—were organized. At Cambridge, Massachusetts, Benedict Arnold told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety about the cannon and other military stores at the lightly defended fort. On May 3, 1775, the Committee gave Arnold a colonel's commission and authorized him to command a secret mission to capture the fort.
[[Image:Fort Ticonderoga 1775.jpg|thumb|250px|Ethan Allen demanding the surrender of Fort Ticonderoga]]
Meanwhile, in Hartford, Connecticut, Silas Deane and others had organized an expedition of their own. Ethan Allen assembled over 100 of his Green Mountain Boys, about 50 men were raised by James Easton at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and an additional 20 men from Connecticut volunteered. This force of about 170 gathered on May 7 at Castleton, Vermont. Ethan Allen was elected colonel, with Easton and Seth Warner as his lieutenants. Samuel Herrick was sent to Skenesboro and Asa Douglas to Panton with detachments to secure boats. Meanwhile, Captain Noah Phelps reconnoitered the fort disguised as a peddler. He saw that the fort walls were in a dilapidated condition and learned from the garrison commander that the British soldiers' gunpowder was wet. He returned and reported these facts to Ethan Allen.

On May 9, Benedict Arnold arrived in Castleton and insisted that he was taking command of the operation, based on his orders and commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety. Many of the Green Mountain Boys objected, insisting that they would go home rather than serve under anyone but Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no documented evidence exists about what the terms of the agreement were. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation.

One guard tried to stop the invaders by firing a shot, but the musket flashed in the pan. The only injury was to one American, who was slightly injured by a sentry with a bayonet.

===Crown Point and Fort St. Johns===
Seth Warner marched a detachment up the lake shore and captured nearby Fort Crown Point, garrisoned by only nine men. On May 12, Allen sent the prisoners to Connecticut's Governor Jonathan Trumbull noting that &quot;I make you a present of a Major, a Captain, and two Lieutenants of the regular Establishment of George the Third.&quot;

Arnold took a small schooner and several bateaux from Skenesboro north with 50 volunteers. On May 18, they seized another garrison at Fort St. Johns along with the Enterprise, a seventy ton sloop. Aware that several companies were stationed twelve miles (19 km) down river at Chambly, they loaded the more valuable captured supplies and cannon, burned the boats they could not take and returned to Crown Point.
[[Image:Benedict Arnold.jpg|thumb|200px|Benedict Arnold]]
Ethan Allen and his men returned home. Benedict Arnold remained with some Connecticut replacements in command at Ticonderoga. At first the Continental Congress wanted the men and forts returned to the British, but on May 31 they bowed to pressure from Massachusetts and Connecticut and agreed to keep them. Connecticut sent a regiment under Colonel Benjamin Hinman to hold Ticonderoga. When Arnold learned that he was second to Hinman, he resigned his Connecticut commission and went home.

===Aftermath===
Although Fort Ticonderoga was no longer an important military post, its capture had several important results. Because rebel control of the area meant that overland communications and supply lines between British forces in Quebec and Boston were severed, British war planners in London made an adjustment to their command structure. Command of British forces in North America, previously under a single commander, was divided into two commands. Sir Guy Carleton was given independent command of forces in Quebec, while General William Howe was appointed Commander-in-Chief of forces along the Atlantic coast, an arrangement that had worked well between Generals Wolfe and Amherst in the Seven Years' War. In this war, however, cooperation between the two forces would prove to be problematic and would play a role in the failure of the Saratoga campaign in 1777.

==Bunker Hill==
===British Strategy===
Boston, being on a peninsula, was largely protected from close approach by the expanses of water surrounding it, dominated by British warships. With the troops in the city able to be resupplied and reinforced by sea, a simple &quot;strangulation&quot; siege could be very protracted, and might be ultimately unsuccessful. Were the besieging Continentals able to bombard the city, on the other hand, the progress of the ongoing siege could be greatly hastened. If a position could be taken (and fortified) close to the city, an artillery bombardment could be begun.

The Charlestown Peninsula started from a short, narrow isthmus at its northwest, extending about one mile (1,600 meters) southeastward into Boston Harbor. Bunker Hill is an elevation (110 feet or 34 meters) at the north of the peninsula and Breed's Hill, at a height of 62 feet (19 meters), is more southerly and nearer to Boston. The town of Charlestown occupied the flats at the southern end of the peninsula. At its closest approach, less than 1,000 feet (300 meters) separated Charlestown Peninsula from the Boston Peninsula, specifically an area occupied by Copp's Hill at about the same height as Breed's Hill. Both sides seem to have realized Charlestown's importance at about the same time.

===American Defenses===
On the night of June 16-17, Colonial Colonel William Prescott led 1,500 men onto the peninsula in order to set up positions from which artillery fire could be directed into Boston as part of the siege of that city. At first, Putnam, Prescott, and their engineering officer, Captain Richard Gridley, disagreed as to where they should locate their defense. Initial work was performed on Bunker Hill, but Breed's Hill was closer to Boston and viewed as being more defensible, and they decided to build their primary redoubt there. Prescott and his men, using Gridley's outline, began digging a fortification 160 feet (50 m) long and 80 feet (25 m) wide with ditches and earthen walls. They added ditch and dike extensions toward the Charles River on their right and began reinforcing a fence running to their left.
[[Image:Map of the Battle of Bunker Hill area.jpg|thumb|250px|The American defenses.]]
===The Battle===
In the early predawn, around 4 a.m., a sentry on board HMS Lively spotted the new fortification. Lively opened fire, temporarily halting the Colonists' work. Aboard his flagship HMS Somerset, Admiral Samuel Graves awoke irritated by the gunfire which he had not ordered. He stopped it, only to reverse his decision when he got on deck and saw the works. He ordered all 128 guns in the harbor to fire on the Colonists' position, but the broadsides proved largely ineffective since the guns could not be elevated enough to reach the fortifications.

It took almost six hours to organize an infantry force and to gather up and inspect the men on parade. General Howe was to lead the major assault, drive around the Colonist's left flank, and take them from the rear. Brigadier General Robert Pigot on the British left flank would lead the direct assault on the redoubt. Major John Pitcairn led the flank or reserve force. It took several trips in longboats to transport Howe's forces to the eastern corner of the peninsula, known as Moulton's Hill. On a warm day, with wool tunics and full field packs of about 60 pounds (27 kg), the British were finally ready by about 2 p.m.
[[Image:Battle of bunker hill by percy moran.jpg|thumb|250px|The British Attack.]]
The Colonists, seeing this activity, had also called for reinforcements. Troops reinforcing the forward positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments of 200 men, under Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals). Stark's men took positions along the fence on the north end of the Colonist's position. When low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north ending at the water's edge on a small beach. Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one fire until the regulars passed it. Private (later Major) John Simpson, however, disobeyed and fired as soon as he had a clear shot, thus starting the battle. The battle of Bunker Hill, had begun.

General Howe detached both the light infantry companies and grenadiers of all the regiments available. Along the narrow beach, the far right flank of the Colonist position, Howe set his light infantry. They lined up four across and several hundred deep, led by officers in scarlet red jackets. Behind the crude stone wall stood Stark's men. In the middle of the British lines, to attack the rail fence between the beach and redoubt stood Reed's men and the remainder of Stark's New Hampshire regiment. To oppose them, Howe assembled all the flank companies of grenadiers in the first line, supported by the 5th and 52nd Regiments' line companies. The attack on the redoubt itself was led by Brigadier General Robert Pigot, commanding the 38th and 43rd line companies, along with the Marines.

Prescott had been steadily losing men. He lost very few to the bombardment but assigned ten volunteers to carry the wounded to the rear. Others took advantage of the confusion to join the withdrawal. Two generals did join Prescott's force, but both declined command and simply fought as individuals. By the time the battle had started, 1,400 defenders faced 2,600 regulars.
[[Image:Bunker Hill by Pyle.jpg|thumb|250px|The continued British Attack.]]
The first assaults on the fence line and the redoubt were met with massed fire at close range and repulsed, with heavy British losses. The reserve, gathering just north of the town, was also taking casualties from rifle fire in the town. Howe's men reformed on the field and made a second unsuccessful attack at the wall.

In the third British assault the reserves were included and both flanks concentrated on the redoubt. This attack was successful. The defenders had run out of ammunition, reducing the battle to close combat. The British had the advantage here as their troops were equipped with bayonets on their muskets but most of the Colonists did not have them.

The British advance, and the Colonists' withdrawal, swept through the entire peninsula, including Bunker Hill as well as Breed's Hill. However, under Putnam, the Colonists were quickly in new positions on the mainland. Coupled with the exhaustion of Howe's troops, there was little chance of advancing on Cambridge and breaking the siege.

==Aftermath==
The British had taken the ground but at a great loss; 1,054 were shot (226 dead and 828 wounded), and a disproportionate number of these were officers. The Colonial losses were only about 450, of whom 140 were killed (including Joseph Warren), and 30 captured (20 of whom died later as POWs). Most Colonial losses came during the withdrawal. Major Andrew McClary was the highest ranking Colonial officer to die in the battle (also reportedly the last casualty). 

Afterwards, British General Henry Clinton remarked in his diary that &quot;A few more such victories would have shortly put an end to British dominion in America.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Plan==
As the conflict around Boston was in a stalemate, American Continental Congress sought a way to seize the initiative elsewhere. Congress had previously invited French-Canadians to join the American Revolution as the fourteenth colony, but this was rejected. Therefore, a plan was devised to drive the British Empire from the primarily francophone colony of Quebec. Two expeditions were undertaken.
[[Image:American quebec 1775.jpg|thumb|250px|The American Invasion Plan.]]
Congress authorized General Philip Schuyler, commander of the Northern Department, to mount an invasion to drive British forces from Canada. He sent General Richard Montgomery north with an invasion force. General George Washington, who had recently been appointed General and Commander-In-Chief, also sent Benedict Arnold towards Quebec City with a supporting force.

==Mongomery's Expedition==
Philip Schuyler was to have led the invasion. On September 12, 1775, he led an expeditionary force to Fort St. John (Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu), where he addressed the populace with a proclamation promising the respect of &quot;their persons, property, religion, and liberties.&quot; But Schuyler fell ill and was replaced by Brigadier General Richard Montgomery. On September 16, 1775, Montgomery marched north from Fort Ticonderoga with about 1,700 militiamen.

They arrived on September 19 and, after a forty-five day siege, they defeated the British at the Battle of Fort St. Jean on November 3. Montgomery's troops continued north and occupied Saint Paul's Island on November 11, crossing to Pointe-Saint-Charles on the following day.

Montreal fell without any fighting on November 13, as Major-General Guy Carleton, the governor of Quebec, had escaped to Québec City with his troops.

Montgomery then moved towards Quebec City with the bulk of his troops on November 28, leaving Montreal under the command of General David Wooster. The historic Château Ramezay served as Continental Army HQ in Montreal.

==Arnold's Expedition==
===Preperations===
The second expedition was led by Benedict Arnold. In 1775, the Continental Congress generally adopted Arnold's plan for the invasion of Canada, but Arnold was not included in the command structure for the effort. Thus rebuffed, Arnold returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and approached George Washington with the idea of a supporting eastern invasion force aimed at Quebec City. Because there had been little direct action at Boston after the Battle of Bunker Hill in June, many units were bored with garrison life and eager for action. Washington agreed with Arnold's proposal. He appointed Arnold a colonel, and together they visited each line unit to ask for volunteers.

Arnold eventually selected a force of 750 men. Washington added Daniel Morgan's company and some other riflemen. The frontiersmen, from the Virginia and Pennsylvania wilderness, were better suited to wilderness combat than to a siege.
[[Image:Richard Montgomery - Project Gutenberg etext 20110.jpg|thumb|200px|General Richard Montgomery.]]
===The Expedition===
The plan called for the men to cover the 180 miles (290 km) from the Kennebec River to Quebec in 20 days. They expected to find relatively light defenses since British Commander Carleton would be busy handling Schuyler's forces at Montreal. Arnold sent ahead to Fort Western (in the Province of Maine) to have supplies and bateaux readied for his force. The expedition moved by sea and spent five days at Fort Western organizing supplies and preparing the boats.

The men expected to go up the Kennebec River and then descend the Chaudière River to Quebec. After staying for three days at Colburn's Shipyard in Gardinerston, where Reuben Colburn built the bateaux at Washington's request in just 15 days, they set out from Fort Western on September 25. Their troubles began almost immediately.

The bateaux were built from green, split pine planks because of a lack of dried lumber at that time of year and were basically flat bottom rafts that could not be rowed but had to be poled against the stream. Colburn traveled with the army, repairing the bateaux as they went, but in hauling them upstream and lowering them down the Chaudiere, many supplies and some men were lost. Rain and violent storms ruined more. Lieutenant Colonel Roger Enos turned back with his division, taking 300 men and some of the supplies with him.

The maps the expedition had started with were faulty, since the British frequently allowed publication of incorrect maps to deceive future enemies. The journey turned out to be 350 miles (560 km), not 180. After the expedition ran out of supplies, the men began to eat anything, including their dogs, their shoes, cartridge boxes, leather, moss, and tree bark. On November 6, the expedition reached the south shore of the St. Lawrence River; Arnold had 600 of his original 1,100 men.

However, Arnold thought they could still take the city. The defenders were only about 100 British regulars under Lieutenant Colonel Allen Maclean, supported by several hundred poorly organized local militia. If the Americans could scatter the militia with accurate fire, they could overwhelm the outnumbered regulars. When they finally reached the Plains of Abraham on November 14, Arnold sent a negotiator with a white flag to demand their surrender, but to no avail. The Americans, with no cannons, faced a fortified city. When the frigate Lizard moved into the river to cut off their rear, they were forced to withdraw to Pointe aux Trembles.

Finally, on December 2, Montgomery came down river from Montreal with 300 troops and bringing captured British supplies and winter clothing. The two forces united, and plans were made for an attack on the city.

==The Battle of Quebec==
The attack began at 4:00 a.m. on December 31, 1775, with Montgomery launching signal rockets. The British were prepared for the Continental assault, as deserters from the Continental Army were straggling into Quebec.
[[Image:Death of Gerneral Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec by John Trumbull 1786.jpg|thumb|250px|The death of Montgomery]]
The two brigades were supposed to meet at the tip of the St. Lawrence river and move into the walled city itself. However, the fortifications proved to be too strong to be taken by force. Montgomery's brigade advanced along the river coastline under the Cape Diamond Bastion, where they came to a blockhouse barricade at Près-de-Ville manned by about 30 French-speaking militia. Montgomery advanced his brigade towards it at a walk, and the militia responded with a volley that cut down Montgomery and the brigade's two other highest ranking officers. The next highest ranking officer ordered a retreat, while the militia continued to snipe at them.

Benedict Arnold was unaware of Montgomery's death and his attack's failure, and he advanced with his main body towards the northern barricades. They were fired upon by British and local militia manning the wall of the city. Upon reaching a street barricade at a street called Sault au Matelot, Arnold was wounded in the left ankle by a musket ball and was taken to the rear. With Arnold out of action, his second-in-command, Daniel Morgan, took command and captured the first street barricade. But while awaiting further orders, the colonists were attacked from the street and surrounding row houses by hundreds of militia. A British counterattack reoccupied the first barricade, trapping Morgan and his men within the narrow streets of the city. With no way of retreat and under heavy fire, all of Morgan's men surrendered. By 10:00, the battle was over, with Morgan surrendering himself and the last pocket of Continental resistance in the city.
[[Image:Canadian militiamen and British soldiers repulse the American assault at Sault-au-Matelot.jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle of Quebec.]]
Arnold refused to give up and—despite being outnumbered three to one, the sub-freezing temperature of the winter and the mass desertions of his men after their enlistments expired on December 31, 1775—laid siege to Quebec. This siege had little effect on the city.

Arnold (now a Brigadier General) was reinforced with Wooster's brigade in March 1776, bringing their strength to 2,000 men.

==The British Counter-Attack==
On May 6, 1776, a small squadron of British ships under Captain Charles Douglas arrived to relieve Quebec with supplies and troops, forcing the Americans to immediately retreat. A few weeks later, British forces in Quebec were strengthened by even more troops under General John Burgoyne and Hessian mercenaries. Another attempt was made by the Revolutionaries to push back towards Quebec, but it failed at Trois-Rivières on June 8, 1776. The new American commander, General Thomas, died of smallpox.

Carleton then launched his own invasion and defeated Arnold in the Battle of Valcour Island in October. Arnold fell back to Fort Ticonderoga, where the invasion of Canada had begun. The invasion of Canada ended as a disaster for the Americans, but Arnold's improvised navy on Lake Champlain had the effect of delaying a full-scale British counter thrust until the Saratoga campaign of 1777. Carleton was heavily criticized in London for not pursuing the American retreat from Quebec more aggressively, and so command of the 1777 offensive was given to General Burgoyne instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sway and the Sway Interpreter==

Consider a computer program designed to help people read an essay.
The simplest task one might ask of this program is the meaning of a word. For
example, one might ask the program the meaning of the word 'expeditious'
to which the program might reply, 'adjective: characterized by quickness'.
An online dictionary is an example of such a program.
By analogy, one could imaging a similar program designed for people
learning how to program. In this case, one would ask the
meaning of a word or phrase in a programming language,
rather than a human language.
Such a program is known as an ''interpreter'' because it translates
phrases from a 'foreign' language (the programming language) to their
meanings (which presumably, we will understand).
The Sway interpreter can answer those types of requests quite easily: To
see that this is so, one starts up the Sway interpreter by issuing the
command sway in response to the system prompt.

&lt;code&gt;
    % sway
    sway&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;

Here, the &lt;tt&gt;% sway&lt;/tt&gt; represents a command to get the Sway interpreter
going. The interpreter signals its
readiness to handle requests by issuing the Sway prompt &lt;tt&gt;sway&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. Consider
someone typing the number 3 and then a semicolon at the Sway prompt:

&lt;code&gt;
    sway&gt; 3;
    INTEGER: 3
&lt;/code&gt;

In the remainder of the text, the person who started up the Sway
interpreter (or is running a Sway program) is known as the ''user''. The
user has just asked the Sway interpreter to evaluate or give the meaning
of 3. The semicolon after the 3 can be thought of as a signal to the
interpreter that the request has been completed, much like the period at
the end of a sentence. The interpreter reads in the request and responds
with the phrase &lt;tt&gt;INTEGER: 3&lt;/tt&gt;. In this text, requests to the interpreter
will, in general, be preceded by the Sway prompt. Responses by the
interpreter will, in general, follow requests. Sometimes, when the
response by the interpreter is not of interest, the response will be omitted.

The response of the interpreter is two-fold; first the type of the
result is displayed (in this case INTEGER) and then the meaning or value
of the result (in this case 3). This is much like looking up a word
in a dictionary. First the type of word (or part of speech)
is given (e.g. noun, verb,
adjective) followed by the meaning of the word. Unlike a dictionary,
a word in Sway always has one meaning. Sway, as with most programming languages,
has a small number of simple types: integers, real, numbers, strings,
and symbols.

The Sway interpreter, in general, evaluates expressions. As a rule,
one signals the end of an expression using the semicolon. In response
to an expression, the interpreter determines its value. As will be seen,
the Sway interpreter can evaluate much more complicated expressions than
integers.

      <comment>The theory of playing by ear</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Playing by ear


Anyone can play by ear with some training but unlike me (Andy Weighell), I was born with the talent. My parents say that it is in my genes. That it was passed on from my Romanian blood. Some people are born with perfect pitch and like playing by ear it can also be learnt. I am going to buy a violin and want to be able to play it. I can play be ear (musically) and so I should be able to play it. I believe that because I was born with the gift of playing by ear, I can play an instrument that I have not played before and pick out the notes. I am going to attempt to play the electronic violin. I am going to try and prove my theory in less than one month. I am attempting this in 3-4 weeks. I shall practice every night for 1-2 hours and by the end of the 3-4 weeks I think that I will be able to play the violin at a standard of which a violinist would play after 3-4 years of playing. I have done is before with the Saxophone, the accordion and the piano. I started playing the piano at the age of about 3-4 years of age and still am at the age of 17. I started playing the Accordion and the Saxophone without any help (what so ever) now I can play them at grade 4 standard. This can be a hard technique to gather but when you have the skill of playing by ear then you can play almost anything and with the theory at grade 5 standard the note reading and the rhythm, it should be easier. I will commence this activity on the 9th of July 1990. I, like with the accordion and the saxophone will attempt this is without any help.

|}

The Professional version allows you to use any .jpg or.gif file as a background image. You can also use any Flash image/animation (up to Flash version 8) as a background. 

You can set this up as part of the quiz properties, in Appearance Settings - Override Background Images.  You will see a section called '''[[../../Quiz Options/Appearance Settings/Override Background Images|Override Background Images]]''' where you can change the background image of the quiz, the loader or the finish screen by browsing for and selecting the file name of your image.

You can use Photoshop or Paintshop to create the images and Flash Studio to create Flash files. See also [[Question Writer Manual/Look and Feel/Change Background and Loader|Background Image]] for more information about the images you can use.

Question Writer also provides a commercial custom theme creation service. There are more details here 
http://www.questionwriter.com/pricing/custom-development.html

|}

You can't import data directly into Question Writer from a database.  However you can export from the database to the [[../../Extras/Importing Questions|Text Import Format]] and import these files into Question Writer.

If you're using the 'results by e-mail' service, in addition to sending you the results by e-mail, we also store all of your results for you in a database. Once you're logged into this service, you can also download the results and responses as a excel file. See the Chapter on [[../../Save and Publish|Save and Publish]] for more details on this.

If this functionality doesn't suit your needs, you can have the quiz send the results and responses to your own server using the [[../../Quiz Options/Web Settings/Send Results over the Internet|Custom Results Server]] - however you may need a programmer to help process the results into your own database. 


To help with this, we have made available a small PHP application that allows you to have results from your Question Writer quizzes written to your own MySQL database.

You can download it here [http://www.questionwriter.com/collator.html]

It comes with installation instructions, but you'll need to be able to set up a database and upload some files to your webserver. It stores the data it receives in two tables - one table for the quiz results, and one table that stores the responses to the individual questions. Once the data is in your database, you'll need to decide what to do with it.
We have kept it fairly basic - you won't need anything more than MySQL 4+ and PHP 5+ and you might well get away with less.

There is a keyboard navigation facility in Question Writer - it uses the standard keyboard navigation commands - use TAB to choose the right control and enter to hit it. 

As the enter key (or return key) is used in essay questions, it can't be used solely for advancing through questions, but the TAB/Enter is a well known and supported keyboard navigation method.

Yes, using the latest version of Question Writer 4 you can ask different questions based on previous responses by setting conditions and evaluating the scores based on these conditions.  You can read more about this in [[Question Writer Manual/About Questions/Question Evaluation|Custom Feedback]] and [[Question Writer Manual/About Questions/Skipping and Branching|Skipping and Branching]].

Unfortunately there is no automatic search feature.  You can set up the questions in sections or some kind of section hierarchy which would help to find similar questions.  

Another idea is to scan for duplicate questions.  You can do this by opening the source file (the .qwz) in Word or a text editor and search for the search term - this will help you at least know if the question is present. '''(Do not resave in the text editor)'''

There are currently 3 versions of Question Writer available:

*Basic - this is available free for personal use
*Standard
*Professional

For full features and prices of the three versions see the website [http://www.questionwriter.com/features.html].

You'll also find a description of these versions in the [[../../Introduction|Introduction]] to this manual.  

If you have not used Question Writer before you can download the Trial version and try it out. Download from the Question Writer Website. [http://www.questionwriter.com/downloadpages/download-quiz.html]

You may also see mention of 'Personal' and 'Publisher' Edition in the blog or Support Forum.  The Personal Edition was the version 2 equivalent of (and has now been replaced by) the Basic Version.  Publisher Edition was designed for use by developers and is no longer available to license.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have changed Collaboration Tools  area take a look. I changed it visually. Do you like it? Does it pull out your message. What did I do? I added Bold headings and bullets. I also embedded the hyperlink into the text (video on youtube) Does this make it simpler to view instead of the full URL. Take a look. What do you think? Can this be done anywhere else on your page? Or is it best not to do these formatting edits? You be the judge.

Activity section. Where is the video I am supposed to view?

Resources. Spell these out more. APA format would be better.

Design on page. Make sure whether you want : after each new section title or not. Sometimes you have this and sometimes you do not. Also, do you want the section titles to be bold or not.


It looks good to me.  I see the blog video there for the activity. Since the resources are  mainly websites, I thought it was easier to view the way we set it up. -Shannon</text>

According to the American Association of School Librarians (AASL):

•	Reading is a window to the world

•	Inquiry provides a framework for learning

•	Ethical behavior in the use of information must be taught

•	Technology skills are crucial for future employment needs

•	Equitable access is a key component for education

•	The definition of information literacy has become more complex as resources and technologies have changed

•	The continuing expansion of information demands that all individuals acquire the thinking skills that will enable them to learn on their own

•	Learning has a social context

•	School libraries are essential to the development of learning skills

Four standards have evolved to meet these needs. The AASL further divides these standards into four sections entitled:

•	Skills

•	Dispositions in Action

•	Responsibilities

•	Self-Assessment Strategies

As teachers and students work together to utilize these standards, they become capable 21st Century learners, ready to enter the Digital Age.

The information for this wiki has come directly from “Standards for the 21st-Century Learner” found at http://www.ala.org/aasl/standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fortification of Dorchester Heights==
On July 3, George Washington arrived to take charge of the new Continental Army. Forces and supplies came in from as far away as Maryland. Trenches were built at the Dorchester Neck, and they were extended toward Boston. Washington reoccupied Bunker Hill and Breeds Hill without opposition. However, these activities had little effect on the British occupation.

Subsequently, in the winter of 1775–76, Henry Knox and his engineers used sledges to retrieve 60 tons of heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga. Bringing them across the frozen Connecticut River, they arrived back at Cambridge on January 24, 1776. Weeks later, in an amazing feat of deception and mobility, Washington moved artillery and several thousand men overnight to occupy Dorchester Heights, overlooking Boston. Since it was the middle of winter and the continental army was unable to dig into the frozen ground on Dorchester Heights, rather than entrenching themselves, Washington's men used logs, branches and anything else available to fortify the position overnight. General Gage observed that it would have taken his army weeks to build Washington's earth fort. The British fleet ceased to be an asset, because it was anchored in a shallow harbor with limited maneuverability, and the American guns on Dorchester Heights were aimed at the fleet.

Washington had hoped General William Howe and his troops would either flee or try to take the hill. At early morning on March 5, Washington rallied the troops by reminding them that it was the sixth anniversary of the Boston Massacre. Initially, Howe ordered an attack on the hill that would have probably been reminiscent of Bunker Hill. However, a snow storm quickly rolled in and halted any chance of a battle. By the time the storm had subsided, Howe's aides had convinced him of the folly of an outright attack. He sent word to the colonists that the city would not be burned to the ground if they were allowed to leave unmolested. Finally, on March 17, the British forces departed Boston and headed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, taking many loyalists with them.

I have migrated over from Wikipedia.

I have no specific intentions towards Wikibooks at the moment, besides general browsing and the occasional edit or small contribution.  Judging by Wikipedia, anything in the future would probably involve film serials, pulp magazines or authors such as Robert E. Howard.

      <comment>Created brief serial module</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Film serials were a type of film popular in the first half of the Twentieth Century. They were created early in film history as a hybrid format.  The first serial, ''What Happened to Mary?'', was released in the United States by Edison Studios in 1912.  At this time most films were short subjects, usually only two reels in length.  This did not, however, provide much time to develop elements such as plot or characterisation.  Some producers were experimenting with longer &quot;feature&quot; films but this was very expensive and resisted by some studios.  The serial format allowed a compromise between the two by combining individual short episodes (or chapters) into a longer narrative.  The overall narrative is the distinction between a film serial and a film series.  The individual episodes of the latter would have independent, stand alone plots while containing the same characters.

It was the second American serial, ''The Adventures of Kathlyn'', in 1913 that set the standard for the format.  It was a collaboration between William Selig and the Chicago Tribune newspaper based on the success of ''What Happened to Mary?''.  Each of the thirteen chapters in the serial, bar the concluding chapter, ended in a cliffhanger, with some element of the plot incomplete.  The addition of cliffhangers to the format was extremely successful and they were used in almost every subsequent serial production.  So integral were they to the format that serials themselves were often referred to &quot;Cliffhangers&quot;.

As feature films became standard, rather than an expensive experimental format, the film serial lost its original purpose.  The format continued for some time, however, with the aim shifting towards the children's entertainment market.  The coming of sound presented another significant problem for the film serial.  Serials had become known for their action and stunt sequences but early sound recording equipment was expensive and bulky.  Most studios could not afford this equipment and those that could did not believe it was possible to film action sequences with sound.  In 1929, Mascot Pictures released the first serial with partial sound, called ''The King of the Kongo''.  Other serials followed suit for a time but it was Universal Pictures that released the first all sound serial, a western called ''The Indians Are Coming'', in late 1930.  Once it had been proven to be possible, most other studios began releasing sound serials of their own although some, such as Pathé, dropped out of the industry altogether.

The sound era of serials were dominated by three studios.  Universal Pictures, which began serial production in 1914, continued regular production, the only major studio of the silent era to do so.  Universal serials took advantage of the company's other assets and featured stronger writing and technical quality than those produced by rival studios.  Mascot Pictures continued for a few years until 1935 when it was merged with other companies to become the serial unit of Republic Pictures.  Republic serials were known for their action, stunts and special effects.  Columbia Pictures was the last of the three to begin serial production, with 1937's ''Jungle Menace''.  Their serials were often cheaply made, even compared to the low budgets of other serial productions, but were still popular.

The end of the serial format came with the end of World War Two.  Production costs increased with material becoming more expensive and unionisation, which had previously been stopped by the Great Depression, became widespread.  Serial budgets had never been large and could not cope well with the changes.  Many cost saving measures were introduced or exploited more fully than had been the case in the past.  For example, later serials contain large amounts of stock footage, with entire scenes taken from earlier productions and edited into the newer releases.  At about the same time the typical serial audience was being stolen by the arrival of television.  The threat from the new medium was compounded by television showings of the older, better produced, serials in competition with the newer releases in theaters.

Universal was the first to end its serial production with ''The Mysterious Mr. M'' in 1946. This left only two serial producers, who continued regular but diminishing production into the next decade.  Republic was the next to stop, ending with ''King of the Carnival'' in 1955.  Columbia spent one year as the only company still producing serials until ''Blazing the Overland Trail'' in 1956.

==Examples==

The most famous serial of the silent era, and still iconic to this day, is ''The Perils of Pauline''.  It was released by Pathé in 1915 with actress Pearl White playing the title character.  It was the French studio's first American success, began the golden age of the silent serial and launched Pearl White's career as the &quot;Queen of Serials&quot;.  Not all of this serial survives but prints of many episodes are available commercially.

''Flash Gordon'', released by Universal in 1936, is the most famous example of the sound serial era.  Buster Crabbe played Flash Gordon and Charles Middleton was cast as Ming the Merciless.  This serial was Universal's attempt to regain an adult audience for the format and benefitted from a larger budget in addition to the studio’s access to props and material from their own feature films.  It did not gain the adult audience but it was a commercial success.  Much like ''The Perils of Pauline'', it made Buster Crabbe the &quot;King of Serials&quot; and began the golden age of the sound serial.  It was followed by two sequels, ''Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars'' (1938) and ''Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe'' (1940), as well as the semi-sequel ''Buck Rogers'' (1939) which also starred Buster Crabbe in the title role.

Columbia, which managed to acquire more licensed properties than the other studios, had one of its most influential releases in 1943's ''Batman''.  The production was cheap, with unintentional humour and poor direction but it remained popular.  It was followed by one sequel, ''Batman and Robin'' (1949), but it's major successor came decades later on television.  Theater showings on the serial, with all fifteen chapters in one sitting under the title &quot;An Evening with Batman and Robin&quot;, became very popular for their &quot;camp&quot; value in the 1960s.  This led the commissioning in 1966 of the Batman television series starring Adam West and Burt Ward.  The serial is also responsible for the now standard appearance of the character Alfred in all media and the style of the television show affected the original comics for several years.

Republic had many successes, with the entire sixteen serial run directed by William Witney and John English, between ''The Lone Ranger'' (1938) and ''Dick Tracy vs. Crime Inc.'' (1941), considered as the best.  Highlights include ''Drums of Fu Manchu'' (1940), which featured strong use of cinematography to add to the suspense, ''Mysterious Doctor Satan'' (1940), originally intended as a Superman adaptation, and especially ''Adventures of Captain Marvel'' (1941), which was the first film adaptation of a superhero comic.  ''Spy Smasher'' in 1942, directed by William Witney alone, is also often cited as Republic's best.

=== Usage ===
This template provides a quick shorthand for writing ruby characters in HTML.

The template takes three arguments,
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{ruby|&lt;character&gt;|&lt;ruby&gt;|&lt;suffix&gt;|&lt;additional ruby&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

When writing words consisting of multiple characters, you will have to evaluate where to best split the ruby markup up.

'''Examples:'''
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Markup
! Result
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{furi|犬|いぬ}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{ruby|犬|いぬ|}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ruby|食|た|べる}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{ruby|食|た|べる}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ruby|日本|にほん|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{ruby|日本|にほん|}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ruby|家|いえ||house}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{ruby|家|いえ||house}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ruby|飛|と|ぶ|fly}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{ruby|飛|と|ぶ|fly}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ruby|のみ|||only}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{ruby|のみ|||only}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ruby|{{ruby|食|た|べ}}{{ruby|尽|つ|くす}}|||consume}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
| {{ruby|{{ruby|食|た|べ}}{{ruby|尽|つ|くす}}|||consume}}
|}

For writing Japanese furigana, please use {{tl|furi}} instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Troubles==
As relations between Great Britain and its American colonies became increasingly strained, the Americans set up a shadow government in each colony, with a Continental Congress and Committees of Correspondence linking these shadow governments. As soon as fighting broke out in April 1775, these shadow governments took control of each colony and ousted all the royal officials. Sentiment for outright independence grew rapidly in response to British actions; the options were clarified by Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, released in January 1776.
[[Image:Declaration_independence.jpg|thumb|300px|The signing of the declaration]]
==Draft==
The &quot;Lee Resolution&quot; presented by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia on June 7, 1776, read (in part): '&quot;Resolved: That these united Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.&quot;' The Second Continental Congress formed a committee, consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut (the &quot;Committee of Five&quot;), to draft a suitable declaration to frame this resolution. The committee decided that Jefferson would write the draft, which he showed to Franklin and Adams. Prior to deciding on Jefferson, both Adams and Franklin turned down the offer, citing that if they wrote it people would read it with a biased eye. Franklin himself made at least 48 corrections, including changing the slogan &quot;Life, Liberty and Property&quot; to &quot;Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot; Jefferson then produced another copy incorporating these changes, and the committee presented this copy to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776.

On July 2 the Congress voted for independence by approving the Lee Resolution, twelve delegations voting in favor while the New York delegation abstained. (New York did not cast its vote for the Lee Resolution until July 9.)

The full Declaration was reworked somewhat in general session of the Continental Congress. Congress, meeting in Independence Hall in Philadelphia, finished revising Jefferson's draft statement on July 4, approved it, and sent it to a printer. At the signing, Benjamin Franklin is quoted as having replied to a comment by Hancock that they must all hang together: &quot;Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately,&quot; a play on words indicating that failure to stay united and succeed would lead to being tried and executed, individually, for treason.
[[Image:Thomas Jefferson rev.jpg|thumb|200px|Thomas Jefferson, the author of the declaration]]
==The News Arrives==
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and the Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as &quot;Dunlap broadsides&quot;. The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8. One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10. The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.

On July 19, Congress ordered a copy be &quot;engrossed&quot; (hand written in fair script on parchment by an expert penman) for the delegates to sign. This engrossed copy was produced by Timothy Matlack, assistant to the secretary of Congress. Most of the delegates signed it on August 2, 1776, in geographic order of their colonies from north to south, though some delegates were not present and had to sign later. Late signers were Elbridge Gerry, Oliver Wolcott, Lewis Morris, Thomas McKean, and Matthew Thornton (who, because of a lack of space, was unable to place his signature on the top right of the signing area with the other New Hampshire delegates, William Whipple and Josiah Bartlett, and had to place his signature on the lower right). As new delegates joined the congress, they were also allowed to sign. A total of 56 delegates eventually signed.

Three delegates never signed. Robert R. Livingston, a member of the original drafting committee, was present for the vote on July 2 but returned to New York before the August 2 signing. John Dickinson, a member of the Continental Congress from Pennsylvania, refused to sign. He was against separation from Great Britain and labored to change the language of the Declaration of Independence to leave open the possibility of a reconciliation. Thomas Lynch voted for the Declaration but could not sign it because of illness.

'''Before''' you go ahead and publish to the web check the Web Settings properties and make sure that you have ticked the [[../../../Quiz Options/Web Settings/Browser Options|Browser Options]] box to maximise the quiz in the browers and given a link for quiz takers to jump to after completing the [[../../../Quiz Options/Web Settings/After Quiz|quiz]].

When you select '''Publish to the Web''', Quiz Writer will create files for you to load your quiz onto your website. 
&lt;br&gt;

 [[Image:QW3Export_to_HTML.jpg|center]]

You will be asked if you would like to open the directory with the files.  Say '''Yes''' and you will see a directory with at least 3 files:

*an HTML document (*.html )
*one or more Shockwave Flash file (*.swf) 
*And a Jscript Script File (*.js)

If you are using pre-generated random quizzes there will be an .swf file for each quiz generated.  


 [[Image:QW3HTML_directory.jpg|center]]


All the files contained in the directory have to be uploaded to your website in a new folder or directory.  The actual process for doing this will depend on your website.  If you do not already have a website see [[../../Create a Web Page|Create a Web Page]] for some help in making your own website and publishing your quizzes online or you could just [[../Publish to Question Writer Tracker/]].

If you choose to publish to '''SCORM''', Question Writer will create single file. This will be a zip file and is a SCORM 1.2 compliant package. You'll be able to import this file into your SCORM compliant LMS (Learning Management System) / VLE (Virtual Learning Environment). 

When users attempt the quiz in the LMS/VLE, the quiz will send back the overall score and the results for each individual question to the LMS/VLE.

If you are using Question Writer with a LMS you might also want to read this blog article from August 2011 on things to check if the import process is not going smoothly [[http://www.questionwriter.com/blog/scorm-how-to-debug-your-lms.html]].

==Uses, Limitations, Parameters and Options==
----
===Uses===
----
'''Template name:Image1ontop'''
Makes a three columned table and places the Table of Contents, (TOC), in it.   Allows one text block and one image with a separate caption to be placed to its right, level with the top of the TOC.   Saves space and looks better than the large expanse of white space which usually exists to the right of the TOC.   The text block will start to wrap when it pushes the image to the right margin, and assumes that there is enough text to fill the vertical space.  

Because the TOC text can vary and because the TOC has its own internal sizing algorithm, a ''widthleft'' option is provided to adjust the width of the leftmost cell, if necessary.

Note that the table can be placed ''anywhere'' on the page, so text could exist above it.   To reduce any excessive gap between such text and the images, consider placing the template in-line with the end of the top text.

===Limitations===
----
I cannot figure out how to fully manage the mind of the TOC so the ''widthleft'' option was found necessary to ''unwrap'' TOC entries on occasion.

Images vary in size so it is important to select images of about the right shape before scaling.   Scale the images to an appropriate height to match the top text block, and/or the TOC.   Remember that when testing this template in the sandbox you will need to type a few dummy headings there to generate a Table of Contents.

{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{image1ontop|Text block here|[[Image:Hawthorn_blossom.jpg|300px]]|Image caption here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}


===Parameters===
----
There are three parameters; 1=text block, 2=image code, and 3=Image caption.  

===Options===
----
;widthleft:   width of the leftmost table cell, with the Table of Contents, (TOC).Default 180px.
;align:       text block alignment, defaults left; options; left,right,center, or justify

When I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, I was put on a Low Sodium Low Fat diet.  After my bypass operations, I was homebound and obsessed over my diet.  I experimented with many foods, and learned a whole new way to cook.  I started a blog for the recipes.  Some I created, some I sourced.

aspiring writer

There are old games being discovered om auction sites, attics and sales, both of the card variety and the board. Sometimes without complete directions. I would like to commit my personal collection of such to Wikibooks. All will include proper licensing if need be. But, I will focus on out of copyright rules first.  Long ago I hand transcribed rules for a 1900s era game and it is all over the internet now. It currently resides in my userspace. The [[W:Touring (card game)]] is largely of my writing and thus will expand here with some useful notations of possible use.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article had several mistakes, and has a lot to be improved:

I've corrected\added the following:

I mentioned that this is a symmetric finite quantum well. This has some unique features (which I have not yet mentioned) such as the existence of a bound state for any well depth, and the fact that the solutions can be chosen at an even and odd basis.

The definiton of V(x) was wrong (I corrected it).

The section about unbound states was completely wrong. There was no mention of the fact that unbound modes are doubly degenerate continuum modes i.e. any energy is allowable (unlike the bound states). This was even proved mathematically based on wrong assumptions on the meaning of an even/odd mode. Also the author was not carefull about when sin equals zero and did not treat that case seperately.

The previous writer wrote &quot;An unbound state must still adhere to parity laws, so we will still have odd and even wavefunctions&quot;,

The above is wrong because of the degeneracy. Thus one can take combinations of even and odd modes which do not adhere to parity laws. The correct way is to say that because Parity and the Hamiltonian are commutative (The potential is symmetric), a basis can be found in which the eigenmodes bound and unbound states are even and odd functions. This does not mean that this is the only basis!

Eran 4/7/08

== Future Changes ==

I changed the unbound section so it has no mistakes (To the best of my knowledge), but I'm sure it could be improved much further, by showing sample solutions of continuum modes and expanding the section about the resonances where the anplitudes above the well become very high.

The modes need to be normalized.

I think the page could be ameliorated by noting the relation of the potential well to optical waveguides and Fabri Perot resonances (Constructive interference).

      <comment>Majority of Linux distributions have configuration files and doesnt change any scripts to set up Networking.  And for laptops, there is NetworkManager that handel the roaming computer</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a few different approaches to Linux system boot procedures. After the kernel boots, it always executes a program called `init'. Many distributions are using a SysV-style init program, predominantly sysvinit developed by Miguel van Smoorenburg, though others are experimenting with replacements. Anyhow, the SysV init program reads its configuration file called &lt;tt&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/tt&gt; and commences the boot process.

Despite the fact that the init program is always the same, the setup of system boot is organized in a different way by each distribution.

Usually the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/tt&gt; file contains an entry looking something like:

 si::sysinit:/etc/init.d/boot

This line specifies the name of the shell script file that actually manages the boot sequence. This file is somewhat equivalent to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in MS-DOS.
There are usually other scripts that are called by the boot script and often the network is configured within one of many of these.

The following table may be used as a guide for your system:

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Distrib. | Interface Config/Routing          | Server Initialization
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Debian   | /etc/init.d/network               | /etc/rc2.d/*
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        RedHat   | /etc/rc.d/init.d/network          | /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/*
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Slackware| /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1                | /etc/rc.d/rc.inet2
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that Debian and Red Hat use a whole directory to host scripts that fire up system services (and usually information does not reside within these files, for example Red Hat systems store all of system configuration in files under /etc/sysconfig, whence it is retrieved by boot scripts). If you want to grasp the details of the boot process, my suggestion is to check &lt;tt&gt;/etc/inittab&lt;/tt&gt; and the documentation that accompanies init. Linux Journal is also going to publish an article about system initialization, and this document will point to it as soon as it is available on the web.

Most modern distributions include a program that will allow you to configure many of the common sorts of network interfaces. If you have one of these then you should see if it will do what you want before attempting a manual configuration.



               -----------------------------------------
               Distrib   | Network configuration program
               -----------------------------------------
               RedHat    | /usr/bin/netcfg
               Slackware | /sbin/netconfig
               -----------------------------------------

To configure network you usually change some files to configure and set up networking and not change these scripts.
