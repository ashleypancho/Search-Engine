==Basic heapsort==

With an existing [[Data Structures/Min and Max Heaps|heap]] data structure, a basic heapsort is simple to implement.

===[[wikipedia:Common_Lisp|Common Lisp]]===

This is an almost direct translation of the heapsort pseudocode found at Wikipedia, taking a list of scalars as input.
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(define macro
  troca (left right)
  &quot;Swap left and right values.&quot;

    ((tmp))

    (setf ,right ,left)
    (setf ,left tmp)))

(define
    shift-down (a start end)
  &quot;Shifts the elements down the heap.&quot;
  (let ((root start)
        (child)
        (swap))
    (loop
      (if (&lt;= (+ (* root 2) 1) end)
          (progn
           (setf child (+ (* root 2) 1))

               (setf swap (+ child 1)))
           (if (not (eql swap root))

                (setf root swap))
             (return-from sift-down)))
        (return)))))

    heapify (a)
  &quot;Makes the input list a heap by repeatedly sifting down.&quot;

    heap = list(lst)

    # Make it into a heap
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    for i in xrange(len(lst)):
        lst[i] = heapq.heappop(heap)
&lt;/source&gt;

==In-place heapsort==

The disadvantage of the basic method is its memory requirement; it requires both an array and a heap of size ''n''.

If we realize that heaps can be stored as arrays, a solution presents itself: Store the heap in the same array as the unsorted/sorted elements.

===[[wikipedia:C programming language|C]]===
This is a fast implementation of heapsort in C, adapted from ''Numerical Recipes in C'' but designed to be slightly more readable and to index from &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void heapsort(int arr[], unsigned int N) 
{
    int t; /* the temporary value */
    unsigned int n = N, parent = N/2, index, child; /* heap indexes */
    /* loop until array is sorted */
    while (1) { 
        if (parent &gt; 0) { 
            /* first stage - Sorting the heap */
            t = arr[--parent];  /* save old value to t */
        } else {
            /* second stage - Extracting elements in-place */
            n--;                /* make the heap smaller */
            if (n == 0) {
                return; /* When the heap is empty, we are done */
            }
            t = arr[n];         /* save lost heap entry to temporary */
            arr[n] = arr[0];    /* save root entry beyond heap */
        }
        /* insert operation - pushing t down the heap to replace the parent */
        index = parent; /* start at the parent index */
        child = index * 2 + 1; /* get its left child index */
        while (child &lt; n) {
            /* choose the largest child */
            if (child + 1 &lt; n  &amp;&amp;  arr[child + 1] &gt; arr[child]) {
                child++; /* right child exists and is bigger */
            }
            /* is the largest child larger than the entry? */
            if (arr[child] &gt; t) {
                arr[index] = arr[child]; /* overwrite entry with child */
                index = child; /* move index to the child */
                child = index * 2 + 1; /* get the left child and go around again */

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About==
The aim of this page is to provide a guide to creating and modifying themes for GTK+ on both Linux and Windows.

==Description==
Customising the look of GTK+ applications involves modifying RC files, usually called &lt;code&gt;gtkrc&lt;/code&gt;.

===Explanation of GTKs rc files.===
Some Gtk apps can have lots of rc files. Theses are initialization files and are usually modified from the application's preference dialog. 
GTKRC files are plain text files saved as &quot;gtkrc&quot; with no extension.
For more information on the GTK+ rc file format visit 
http://library.gnome.org/devel/gtk-tutorial/stable/c2111.html
This guide will concentrate on the one file that is used to adjust the look and feel of the application.

===GTKRC'S===

A GTK+ rc file can contain 4 main parts:
*The Style Declaration &amp;ndash; How an item will be drawn onscreen,
*A Class Declaration &amp;ndash; Assigns styles to a class,
*A Widget Declaration &amp;ndash; Assigns a style to a widget,
*A Widget_class Declaration &amp;ndash; Assigns a style to a particular widget by class name.


All GTK+ programs are made up of widgets and there are several attributes or flags that can be set for each widget:
*'''fg''' &amp;ndash; modifies the foreground of the widget,
*'''bg''' &amp;ndash; modifies the background of the widget,
*'''base''' &amp;ndash; the widget's Editable, Tree, or List background,
*'''bg_pixmap''' &amp;ndash; assigns an image to the background of the widget,
*'''font''' &amp;ndash; changes the font attributes.


And each of these can have several states:
*[NORMAL] &amp;ndash; The widgets normal state,
*[PRELIGHT] &amp;ndash; When a mouse cursor is hovering over a widget (this is used by buttons and their subclasses),
*[ACTIVE] &amp;ndash; For active widgets e.g. selected tab and scroll bars,
*[INSENSITIVE] &amp;ndash; A disabled widget,
*[SELECTED] &amp;ndash; Highlighted objects in a widget e.g. text.


The colors for these can be set using 1 of 3 different methods:
#A GTK+ string &amp;ndash; This is a number between 0 and 1,
#Hexadecimal &amp;ndash; The same as some website, values are set like this - #000000, and can be any value between 00 and ff,
#RGB &amp;ndash; This is any number between 0 and 256 e.g. 256 256 256,

To adjust the properities of a widget you need to first define a style.

===Style===

A style declaration may look something like this:-

 style &quot;default&quot;
 {
     font = &quot;-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*&quot;
     fg[NORMAL] = &quot;#000000&quot;
     fg[PRELIGHT] = &quot;#000000&quot;
     fg[ACTIVE] = &quot;#000000&quot;
     fg[SELECTED] = &quot;#000000&quot;
     fg[INSENSITIVE] = &quot;#999999&quot;
 }

The first line is the style declaration, this line defines a new style and calls it default (of course this can be called anything you want).The following lines are the actual style. However for this to be applied it needs to be assigned to a [[GTK+]] widget.

===Gtk Widgets===
There are many widgets in the GTK system but for the sake of the tutorial we will target the top most parent widget called  - widget_class &quot;GtkWindow&quot;, of which all other widgets will get there style from.
To assign a style to a widget you would use:
 widget_class &quot;GtkWindow&quot; style &quot;window&quot;
This instructs the widget called &quot;GtkWindow&quot; to use the style &quot;window&quot;.

When the above code is copyed to a gtkrc file and accompinied with:
 widget_class &quot;GtkWindow&quot; style &quot;default&quot;
and saved in the &quot;theme&quot; folder a difference should be noticed next time a GTKApplication is started or restarted.


===Extending this to include images===

To include images in a theme you would have to create the images and save them in the folder with the previously created gtkrc file.
Once there you would edit the file to use the image.

 style &quot;Button&quot;
 {
     bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = &quot;warning.xpm&quot;
 }

this is an example of using images (please note you will need to create warning.xpm in [[GIMP]] for this to work.

==1. Be at least in the 8th grade.==
One must have a certain level of academic achievement and maturity before becoming a tutor, so this honor is reserved for those in 8th grade or above.

==2. Describe the social conditions that make it more difficult for underprivileged children to achieve basic reading and math skills during elementary school.==
Underprivileged children have several disadvantages that can affect their school work.  
;Poor nutrition: This affects overall health, cognitive abilities, school absenteeism, and may cause a child to become emotionally needy which leads to disruptive behavior.

;Overcrowded Schools: Urban areas suffer from overcrowding in public schools.  Teachers are forced to spend a great deal of their time administering discipline or working to keep the students safe from other students rather than in educating.  These schools are usually underfunded as well, since most school funding comes from local sources, and these schools are located in places where funding is extremely difficult to come by.  Thus, these schools are often poorly equipped.

;Absent Parents: Many underprivileged children do not have the opportunity to spend much time with their parents, as their parents must spend a lot of time out of the home to earn enough money just to meet the basics.  Children are thus often left to fend for themselves and do not benefit from parental guidance.  These parents are often uneducated themselves, so even if they were able to stay home, they may not be equipped to help their children with their school work.  The types of jobs available to the uneducated often require the parents to work odd hours, so when the children come home from school, the parents are at work.  When the parents and children are home together, the parent is often exhausted to the point of collapse, or preoccupied with other problems (how to pay bills, deal with drug problems, etc.).  Parents under such stress often become abusive.  Two-parent families are rare in urban neighborhoods, so the child may have never lived with his or her father, and may have never even met him.

;English as a Second Language: Many underprivileged children come from homes where English is not spoken, so they have to learn the language outside the home.  They may not be accustomed to hearing English spoken with grammatical correctness.  In many underprivileged homes, newspapers and books are rarely seen.

;Living Conditions: Urban areas are very dense, with a lot of people crammed into a very small area.  Large (or multiple) families are forced to live in two- or one-bedroom apartments, so there is not much room for privacy, or a quiet place to study.  Noise from adjacent apartments easily transmits through the walls, so when there are no fights going on in the child's own  home, there may be fights going on in an adjacent apartment.  Conflict can be heard at all hours of the day and night.

;Poor Self-Image: Children raised in the environment described here may have a very poor self-image.  They are accustomed to failure and may have accepted it as their unavoidable destiny.  They may not care if they fail and may take no pride in their work.

==3. Explain the major types of community-based tutoring programs:==
===a. In-school, cross-age tutoring===
In school programs are managed in a variety of ways.  One common way is cross-age tutoring.  In this case students, normally of a higher grade level, tutor other students in the areas where they need assistance.  There are many advantages of this type of one on one peer tutoring: often the tutor has recently completed the same classes having a perspective on the unique issue a particular class presents, comradery can be formed quickly which often promotes the tutored to relax and lower their guard creating a better learning environment.  Cross-age tutoring offers the tutor the opportunity to develop social skills and management skills not often developed in the school years of youth, giving the tutor an added benefit as well.

===b. After-school or weekend program===
This type of tutoring program is perhaps the most common.  They are often organized by church-related groups or community organizations.  Adventist Community Services (ACS) most often participates in after-school or weekend programs.  These programs meet once or twice per week and make use of volunteer tutors.

===c. Community homework center===
Community homework centers are not common to most areas.  These centers often operate in the inner city of metropolitan areas as a haven for students who would otherwise be distracted by the environment around them.  Centers such as these are normally not-for-profit corporations that are open to all youth seeking a place of refuge to study and socialize, their continuance is dependent upon the generosity of the community and the dedication of what is often one or two full-time staff members.  Peer tutoring and assistance from staff are available at these locations, and the staff often fill a parent-like role for students who are often neglected at home.  In addition to a safe a proper place for study, such centers usually offer some recreation and community service opportunities to the youth who use them.  These non-study activities help to develop social skills and skills in cooperation, self control, and problem solving as well as provide a special sense of accomplishment to youth who otherwise have no purpose in there lives.

==4. Explain the difference between one-on-one tutoring and small-group classes, and list the pros and cons of each approach.==
In a one-on-one tutoring session the tutor helps only one student at a time.  In a small-group tutoring session, the tutor helps two or more (but not very many more) students at a time.

In a one-on-one tutoring session, the tutors attention is undivided, the student gets more tutoring time, instruction is tailored to the student, and it moves at the pace set by the student.  In a group setting, the amount of time the tutor can spend per student is more limited,  the tutor must balance the needs of all students, and some students may slip into a non-participatory role.  However, students can benefit from the questions asked by other students - questions the student was afraid to ask, or questions that the student didn't think of.  A wider variety of information is shared in a group setting.

==5. List the basic functions included in the job description of the volunteer tutor in a community-based tutoring program.==
The tutor must first work to establish a relationship with the child.  It is very important to establish trust.  Do not talk down to the child.  Listen carefully to the child and try to figure out what he enjoys (this will help when selecting reading material later).

Next, the tutor should determine the child's reading level.  This can be done by bringing several short books (or booklets) that you think might interest the child.  Spread them out on the table and ask the child to select one and read it out loud to you.  Then have him choose another.  The child's reading level will be the most advanced book he can read comfortably.  You may wish to allow the child to bring one of the books home to keep as his own.

As tutoring progresses, you will need to find creative ways to encourage the student to achieve his goals.  When the child is discouraged, it will be up to you to cheer him on - but do not do the work for the student.  Validate the child's feeling that he work he is struggling with may be difficult, but stress that the child is capable of doing it.  Suggest alternative approaches to problem solving.

Finally, it is critical that the tutor become a reliable partner in the learning process.  If you must miss a tutoring session, try to notify the child ahead of time.  Do your best to keep appointments.  Failure to do so will undermine your influence with the child and reinforce the child's concept that no one can be relied upon.

==6. Describe the resources or tools that a volunteer tutor uses in a community-based tutoring program.==
A variety of reading materials should be on hand for the child to take home.  Include biographies, books on sports or hobbies, stories, magazines, comic books, and newspapers.  

Workbooks filled with puzzles are also available, and many allow you to photocopy individual pages to hand out to the student.

Find ways that mathematics relate to real life and use those.  Games such as monopoly require the ability to add and subtract, and at times do multiplication and comparison (such as when you draw a real estate tax card - pay $1500 or 10% of the value of all property owned).  

You could also set up a store and use play money for &quot;purchases&quot;.  Allow the child to be either the store keeper or the customer.

Flash cards can also be very helpful.

Younger children need a frequent change of pace.  If you can alternate between &quot;quiet&quot; activities and physical activities, you may find that the child is able to work out his energy and then stay better focussed.

A good library of reference materials is also most helpful, and would include dictionaries, a set of encyclopedias, an almanac, and a thesaurus.

Refreshments may also be useful, and you may be able to get local businesses to donate them for the tutoring program.

==7. Complete at least ten tutoring sessions with a younger child.==
Volunteer at a tutoring place or ask schools in your area if they know of anyone who would like a tutor. You may be required to go through some training before you can begin your work as a tutor.  Treat this as a valuable learning experience (after all, if you are unwilling to learn, you are most likely not fit to teach!)

Be sure that you can commit to at least ten tutoring sessions.  It is extremely unlikely that you will be able to accomplish anything meaningful with a child in fewer sessions.  If you are not committed to tutoring at least ten sessions, it would be better for the child if you did not begin at all.  Indeed, it would be morally reprehensible for you to engage otherwise.  Remember that a lack of commitment can be damaging to a vulnerable child, so there is a lot more at stake than whether you earn this honor or not.  A child's future may hang in the balance, so '''''stick to it!'''''

== Removed RealBASIC implementation ==

I removed an implementation in RealBASIC from a commonly-used library because its license is incompatible with the GPL. Its documentation states:

:''SortLibrary is free for your use in projects (I wouldn't mind a small mention in the about box) and open source, but it is not public domain.  All code and documentation © 2001-2005 Charles Yeomans.''

He never mentions an explicit license, and the above is so vague that it's impossible to establish whether it's suitable for this use. Try getting him to release it under the GFDL or a non-copyleft license like MIT/X11 or BSD, which are probably compatible. [[User:Deco|Deco]] 23:36, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

== Removed C++ implementation ==

I removed an implementation in C++ because it was ridiculously badly written. It was thousands times slower than the C version just because the author abused the C++ features in a very evil way! In fact it was so bad, that I wouldn't be surprised if the author did that on purpose to &quot;prove&quot; that C++ programs must be ridiculously slow. Here goes the code as an example how to NOT write programs in C++.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;vector&gt;
using namespace std;
 
 template&lt;typename T&gt;
 void sortieren(vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; m_array)
 {			 
   int k = 0;
   T x ;
   for(unsigned int j = 0; j &lt; m_array.size(); j++){
         x = m_array.at(j);
         k = j;
 
           while(k &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; x &gt; m_array.at(k-1)){
 
           m_array.erase(m_array.begin() +k); // abuse
           m_array.insert(m_array.begin()+k,m_array.at(k-1)); // abuse
           k --;
           }
        m_array.erase(m_array.begin() +k); // abuse
        m_array.insert(m_array.begin()+k,x);  // abuse
    }			 
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
As a side note insertion sort has already been provided with the C++ standard library in the header file &lt;algorithm&gt; as std::__insertion_sort and ofcourse it is very fast. In fact it is most often even faster than the C version presented on the wiki page.

Sample timings for an x86, gcc 4.3.0 (-O3) , win32 machine for a std::vector&lt;int&gt; consisting of 10000 pseudo-random generated elements (from the range 0 - 9999):

bubble: 0.36s, C-style (wiki) insertion sort: 0.13s, std::__insertion_sort: 0.06s, the sort presented above: 267.13s(!?).

[[User:Anonymous|Anonymous]][[Special:Contributions/83.24.205.241|83.24.205.241]] ([[User talk:83.24.205.241|talk]]) 11:02, 11 May 2008 (UTC)

== Removed C++ standard library usage example ==

I've decided to remove the stdlib example presented below, because it doesn't show the implementation of the algorithm. Instead I've put a note informing that such beast as std::__insertion_sort exists.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // for: std::__insertion_sort
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iterator&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

int main()
{
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec;
    vec.push_back(7);
    vec.push_back(4);
    vec.push_back(2);
    __insertion_sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());
    copy(vec.begin(), vec.end(), std::ostream_iterator&lt;int, char&gt;(std::cout, &quot; &quot;));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Composition in Art is a personal achievement of balance and design, leading the eye into the picture and back out again to the viewer.
The line that leads the eye to the subject matter at hand, tells the story along it's path, side issues are displayed in lines that circle the subject, or lines that emanate from it. Patterns appear useful, to depict spaces into which additional subject matter is delineated. These patterns are formed by the three geometric symbols available to all in their simplest shapes, such as triangles, squares (rectangles) and circles. They take form as cones, cubes and balls, made visible by a light source and shadow, formed from an arrangement of the underlying shapes inherent in their disposition. This is where an understanding of perspective comes into play. Before getting technical, feel your subject out, for gesture, character, action and willingness of place of importance. Take yourself as being one of the characters, perhaps the main subject, whatever and whoever that may be, and imagine your place, your stance, your reason for being, and ask yourself, where would the next character be in relation to the one you are now representing, and so on and so on, until you have thought out your groupings. Now do the same with various objects and elements, that as props in a play, have meaning and significance and take their part in your picture. That will be all for starters, but what comes next is just as important and critical. Where is the light to come from, is it a bright day or a somber situation, is it evening or fog, is it a happy occasion, or is it raining and howling like the wind, is it a sad affair or one of humorous jest. The mood you wish to impart to your viewer, will set the tone and temper the colors you use, it is sometimes identified as local color, but it is whatever color you make it. You are the artist, it is your composition, you are the God of the canvas, or at least the extension of whatever God you believe in, when you set sail to paint up a storm. The rules are like guiding stars, leading the way, to assist you on your journey. Study the Masters, their enlightened moments, show their passion and discipline, at achieving their true aim, which is to capture your interest in their story, even though it is the story sometimes of others. May you meet your own maker, in those moments where, when you are working, you are here, but not here. That is the moment when as  a craftsman, the love of art, reaches it's highest exaltation. Be exalted, be dedicated and be sincere and you are sure to find your own reward.
Peace be with you my friends. Randy Ranson

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!

I think that merging this book with &quot;Updating the Linux kernel&quot; is probably not such a good idea. This book and &quot;Inside Linux Kernel&quot; is made for developers and &quot;Updating the Linux kernel&quot; for users. I think that a Link is a better idea.

== Clarification ==
This is quite an interesting page. But what does:
&lt;pre&gt;
cat /proc/cmdline
arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S
arch/i386/kernel/head.S: calls start_kernel
In init/main.c:
start_kernel, rest_init, init, run_init_process
&lt;/pre&gt;
refer to? The meaning of the other boxes is immediately apparent either. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 05:51, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== merge ==

I suggest merging [[Inside Linux Kernel]] into [[The Linux Kernel]].
As far as I can tell, both books talk about the same topic with the same target audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I recently made a change in the wiki book that was called Kings and Queens of England this was a clear mistake and a misrepresentation of the facts. I have changed this to Kings and Queens of the United Kingdom because since 1603 and the Union of the Scottish and English crowns, the Monarch has been at least the King/Queen of these two countries, not to mention Wales and Norhtern Ireland.

:It's no mistake. I don't think anyone could realistic see Alfred the Great or William the Conqueror as Kings of the United Kingdom:) Although the term &quot;Queen of England&quot; is not formally used nowadays, many people the world over will still refer to Queen Elizabeth as the Queen of England, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 09:15, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

Compared with [[fr:Livre_de_cuisine/Beurre_blanc]] and Julia Child you are a bit stingy with the butter. I was wondering whether 10 - 12 ozs. was intended rather than 10 - 12 tablespoons. Anyway I adjusted it so that it is now the same as the recipe in Livre de cuisine which is about halfway between you (anonymous) and Julia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikipedia|Pigeonhole sort}}
All the examples currently on this page seem to be implementations of [[Algorithm Implementation/Sorting/Counting sort|counting sort]] and not pigeonhole sort. Pigeonhole sort, when sorting a complex data structure with a key, keeps track of all the elements on a certain key (because equal elements are still distinct); rather than just keep a count like counting sort (which is only applicable to simple value types).

==C99==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void pigeonhole_sort(int *low, int *high, int min, int max)
{
   /* used to keep track of the size of the list we're sorting */
   int count; 
   /* pointer into the list we're sorting */
   int *current; 
   /* size of range of values in the list (ie, number of pigeonholes we need)*/
   const int size = max - min + 1;  
   /* our array of pigeonholes */
   int holes[size];  
 
   /* make absolutely certain that the pigeonholes start out empty */
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; ++i)
          holes[i] = 0;
 
   /* Populate the pigeonholes.  */
   for (current = low; current &lt;= high; current++)
      holes[*current - min] += 1;
 
   /* Put the elements back into the array in order.  */
   for (current = low, count = 0; count &lt; size; count++)
      while (holes[count]-- &gt; 0)
         *current++ = count + min;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; could also easily be determined within the function.

==Java==
&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
public static void pigeonhole_sort(int[] a)
{
    // size of range of values in the list (ie, number of pigeonholes we need)
    int min = a[0], max = a[0];
    for (int x : a) {
        min = Math.min(x, min);
        max = Math.max(x, max);
    }
    final int size = max - min + 1;

    // our array of pigeonholes
    int[] holes = new int[size];  

    // Populate the pigeonholes.
    for (int x : a)
        holes[x - min]++;

    // Put the elements back into the array in order.
    int i = 0;
    for (int count = 0; count &lt; size; count++)
        while (holes[count]-- &gt; 0)
            a[i++] = count + min;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==PHP==
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
function pigeon_sort($arr)
{
//search min and max
$min = $max = $arr[0];
foreach ($arr as $num)
{       if ($num &lt; $min)
                $min = $num;
        if ($num &gt; $max)
                $max = $num;
}

foreach ($arr as $num)
        $d[$num-$min]++;

for ($i = 0; $i &lt;= $max - $min; $i++ )
        while ($d[$i + $min]-- &gt; 0)$res[] = $i+$min;
return $res;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Python==
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def pigeonhole_sort(a):
    # size of range of values in the list (ie, number of pigeonholes we need)
    my_min = min(a)
    my_max = max(a)
    size = my_max - my_min + 1

    # our list of pigeonholes
    holes = [0] * size

    # Populate the pigeonholes.
    for x in a:
        assert type(x) is int, &quot;integers only please&quot;
        holes[x - my_min] += 1

    # Put the elements back into the array in order.
    i = 0
    for count in xrange(size):
        while holes[count] &gt; 0:
            holes[count] -= 1
            a[i] = count + my_min
            i += 1
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the wording on Jamestown, I'm not sure how it should be phrased. I would say European instead of English, but then it would ignore the Viking settlement. For now I've changed it to first permanent European settlement, Viking one might not be considered permenant since it wasn't very long. --[[User:Mathwizard1232|Mathwizard1232]] 20:59, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

=== Methodism ===
John and Charles Wesley are credited to creating Methodism in the 18th century.  John Wesley was a cleric for the Church of England.  He and his brother led groups of Christians throughout England, Ireland, and Scotland.  These small groups came to form what is known as Methodism.  Methodists focused on bible study and living a life free of amusement and luxury.  They were called Methodists because of there methodistic habits to religion.

Methodism spread to America in the late 1760's.  Philip Embury and Barabara Heck emigrated to New York to start a Methodist society.  They were aided by Captain Webb from the British Army by starting a society in Philadelphia.  Robert Strawbridge started his Methodist work in Maryland.

== Overview ==

'''''Hermes''''' is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy Weasley]]'s owl. Percy received Hermes as a gift in his fifth year ([[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] first year) for being made a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|prefect]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Hermes is mentioned in passing, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] mentions that he has to put up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Errol|Errol]], who has grown rather old.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Harry is staying at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|the Burrow]] just before school starts, Ron mentions that he had wanted to borrow Hermes to send some messages, but that Percy, who was staying shut up in his room all summer, would not loan him.

At the end of the book, we learn that Percy has been sending messages back and forth to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Penelope Clearwater|Penelope Clearwater]], his girlfriend, and that is why Hermes had been busy.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

Hermes appears at the window of the Gryffindor common room late at night on the Saturday of the first week of school. He is carrying a letter from Percy directed at Ron, which Percy had wanted delivered separately from the regular mail. Hermes leaves immediately, not waiting for a reply. The letter, full of the sort of pontification that Percy is known for, only makes Ron angry, though Harry and Hermione find it rather amusing, particlarly the parts where Percy warns Ron that Harry may be mentally unstable.

==Ingredients==
*3 tablespoons cream of wheat
*4 pods cardamom
*3 teaspoons sugar
*1 pinch salt
*1 tablespoon butter
*1/2 cup (120g) cashew nuts (broken)
*1/2 cup (120g) raisins
*1 cup (240ml) milk

==Procedure==
# Wash the cashews and raisins and keep them ready.
# Crush the cardamom pods to remove the contents and discard the husks. Pound the contents of the pods into a black powder and mix with the cream of wheat.
# Add the sugar and salt to the cream of wheat and mix thoroughly.
# Melt the butter in a saucepan and gently fry the cream of wheat in it.
# Add the cashews and raisins to the saucepan and continue to fry until the cream of wheat is light brown.
# Add the milk to the saucepan and stir. The mixture will thicken and you will need to keep stirring to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the saucepan and burning.
# When the mixture solidifies, turn off the heat and take the saucepan off the heat.
# The Soji is ready for serving, but beware as it will be hot

It seems to me that this module could be an eternal stub: is there enough information on this topic to constitute an entire book? Maybe this could be merged with another book. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 02:13, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

I think you're right. [[User:John Duncan|John Duncan]] 12:37, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

== Self-promotion ==

[[User:68.216.29.69]]: Don't do it. A summary of hiring companies is not the place to argue why union or non-union is better and it's not the place to put shameless, self-promotion. You put that stuff on your own web page. You could, if you wanted, put a link to your hiring page where you can marinate the viewer in as much bathos as you want.

Hi. Are you planning on writing this book? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 02:55, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

== Hint ==

You should not format chapter titles as &quot;Book title/Contents/Chapter title,&quot; but rather as &quot;Book title/Chapter title.&quot; You can type &lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Chapter title/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; on the contents page of a book to link to a sister page instead of a subpage. Good luck on your book, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 03:06, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

: It is also not a good idea to have the cover page of a book have a different title than the rest of the book. You may also want to develop your book on a single page first, then divide it into subpages if it gets to long. Thanks, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 03:08, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

== Please do not copy encyclopedic content from Wikipedia ==

If you would like to write encyclopedic entries, please do so on [[w:|Wikipedia]]. Wikibooks should be written in the format of textbooks. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 03:12, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

== Pictures ==

As you can see at the top of this page, &quot;All unlicensed images uploaded to wikibooks before November 1, 2006 will soon be deleted.&quot;  You have uploaded images and some of them are untagged. You can see them [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=img_user_text&amp;max=500&amp;img_user_text=AmishThrasher&amp;grouped= here].  Please review them and add appropriate tags.  If you have any questions, feel free to [[User talk:Think Fast|ask me]].  --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 04:27, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

When Columbus arrived in America there were multiple distinct groups with separate ways of life living within the new world. These groups most likely developed independently from the rest of the world despite possible random contacts between America and Asia.
===Ancient Cultures===
The early human groups within America were able to adapt to their various environments and evolve culturally in their own individual way, un-influenced by other cultures. Like other early human groups, they followed similar patterns of cultural development (Stone Age, New Stone Age, Bronze Age Empires). The first humans probably arrived from Asia utilizing the Bering Strait some 40,000 years ago, and continued until 10,000 B.C. However there is currently dispute about the estimated arrival of humans due to arrow tips found in Chile and Brazil that suggest an earlier occupation, as well as the significant amount of time which would be required for the formation of the many languages within Latin America.

In pre-Columbian times, most of modern Central America was part of the Mesoamerican civilization. The Native American societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central Mexico in the north to Costa Rica in the south. The pre-Columbian cultures of Panama traded with both Mesoamerica and South America, and can be considered transitional between those two cultural areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">During Spanish rule, Latin America was parcelled out among four viceroyalties:

* New Spain
* Peru
* New Granada
* Rio del Plata

Central America was composed of six independent nations: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. After the Spanish conquest in the 16th century, most of the inhabitants of Central America shared a similar history. The exception was British Honduras, a sparsely populated area that was leased by the Spanish Crown to Great Britain for 150 years for the exploitation of certain natural dyes. Later the region of Belize was claimed as a colony by the English Crown and to never go back to Spain or Guatemala, which claimed as its territory until the 1970s . British Honduras for the English and Belice for the Spaniards and Guatemalans gained its independence from Great Britain in 1981 having adopted the name &quot;Belize&quot; in 1973.

From the 16th century through 1821 Central America formed the Captaincy General of Guatemala, sometimes known also as the Kingdom of Guatemala, composed by the states of Chiapas (now part of Mexico), Guatemala (including present day Belize), El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. Officially, the Captaincy was part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and therefore under the rule of the Spanish viceroy in Mexico City. It was, however, administered not by the viceroy or his deputies, but by an independently appointed Captain General headquartered first in Antigua Guatemala and later in Guatemala City.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In 1821 a congress of Central American criollos declared their independence from Spain, effective on 15 September of that year. That date is still marked as the independence day by most Central American nations. The Spanish Captain General, Gabino Gaínza, sympathized with the rebels and it was decided that he should stay on as interim leader until a new government could be formed. Independence was short-lived, for the conservative leaders in Guatemala welcomed annexation by the Mexican Empire of Agustín de Iturbide on 5 January 1822. Central American liberals objected to this, but an army from Mexico under General Vicente Filisola occupied Guatemala City and quelled dissent.
When Mexico became a republic the following year, it acknowledged Central America's right to determine its own destiny. On 1 July 1823, the congress of Central America declared absolute independence from Spain, Mexico, and any other foreign nation, and a Republican system of government was established.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Frenzy of Deletion Disrupts Semantic Levels ==

There used to be a page for Operators/&amp;amp;, too,
if I remember correctly, even if it was a redirect.
Having two roads
leading to &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; is very appropriate for an Ada book,
whichever
form it will use for two roads. However, if my conclusions from reading
about recent deletions are correct, [[User:Jguk]] has declared one road useless,
and deleted references to the page.
(Jon, since you write about kings and queens, you are probalby aware that not everyone
is in a position do things to just about anything or anyone without stating justifications,
in particular
in a collaborative effort.)

The Ada term &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; does
have two different meanings at two separate levels,
in Ada. The distinction can be essential.
I won't agree
with [[User:Jguk]]'s rash cleanups without someone
taking care of a suitable replacement, or triggering a course of
action. Readers will be lost, and readers is what wikibooks are about.

These are '''not''' useless redirects (or else see below) as

# of course the book teaches '''why''' there are two meanings, i.e. why we have both an operator and a delimiter, although both are written &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.
# Other modules have epxlicitly referred to these two different aspects of &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;. After the deletions, they are partly disconnected.

It doesn't seem a good idea to arbitrarily delete things if you don't know the
semantic implications
of what you intend to delete.

If the wikibooks cleaning crew
is unhappy with an apparent yet necessary redundancy (a redirect for now),
maybe transcluding a common page
in both a ''delimiter-aspect'' module and a
''operator-aspect'' module, will do.

ceterum censeo that authors might feel a need to delete thoughtless editing.

:I think the admin thought the redirect was not intentional, but an outcome of a page move. Sure we can recreate the pages without further discussion. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:20, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

:: OK, thanks. This also removes the neccessity of special &amp;amp;-case circuitry from [http://home.arcor.de/bauhaus/Tools/ASnip/ ASnip]. [User:Kellen]'s answer in the staff lounge WRT these redirects was affirmative, too. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 01:40, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Politics==
Central American liberals had high hopes for the federal republic, which they believed would evolve into a modern, democratic nation, enriched by trade crossing through it between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. These aspirations are reflected in the emblems of the federal republic: The flag shows a white band between two blue stripes, representing the land between two oceans. The coat of arms shows five mountains (one for each state) between two oceans, surmounted by a Phrygian cap, the emblem of the French Revolution.
In practice, however, the federation faced insurmountable problems. The liberal democratic project was strongly opposed by conservative factions allied with the Roman Catholic clergy and the wealthy landowners. Transportation and communication routes between the states were extremely deficient. The bulk of the population lacked any sense of commitment towards the broader federation. The federal bureaucracy in Guatemala City proved ineffectual. Wars soon broke out between various factions both in the federation and within individual states. The poverty and extreme political instability of the region prevented the construction of an inter-oceanic canal (see Nicaragua Canal and Panama Canal), from which Central America could have obtained considerable economic benefits.

==Presidents==
1823 – 1825 : José Cecilo del Valle
1825 – 1829 : Manuel José Arce
1829 – 1830 : José Francisco Barrundia (interim president after Arce's resignation)
1830 – 1839 : Francisco Morazán (continued as chief of state of the disintegrating republic until 1840)

==Dissolution of the Union==
The union dissolved in civil war between 1838 and 1840. Its disintegration began when Nicaragua separated from the federation on November 5, 1838, followed by Honduras and Costa Rica. The union effectively dissolved in 1840, by which time four of its five states had declared independence. The union was only officially ended upon El Salvador's self-proclamation of the establishment of an independent republic in February 1841.

Various attempts were made to reunite Central America in the 19th century, but none succeeded for any length of time:
The first attempt was in 1842 by former President Morazán, who was quickly captured and executed. The abortive attempt aimed to restore the union as the Confederation of Central America and included El Salvador, Guatemala (which withdrew early), Honduras, and Nicaragua. This first attempt lasted until 1844.

A second attempt was made and lasted from October to November 1852 when El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua created a Federation of Central America (Federación de Centro América). Guatemalan President Justo Rufino Barrios attempted to reunite the nation by force of arms in the 1880s and was killed in the process like his 1842 predecessor.
A third union of Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador as the Greater Republic of Central America or &quot;República Mayor de Centroamérica&quot; lasted from 1896 to 1898.

The latest attempt occurred between June 1921 and January 1922 when El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras formed a (second) Federation of Central America. This second Federation was nearly moribund from the start having only a Provisional Federal Council made up of delegates from each state.

Despite the failure of a lasting political union, the sense of shared history and the hope for eventual reunification persist in the nations formerly in the union. In 1856–1857 the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by U.S. adventurer William Walker. Today, all five nations fly flags that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The United Provinces of Central America was a short-lived Latin American experiment in republican democracy. It lasted from July 1823 to approximately 1840. It was intended to be a federal republic modeled after the USA. The coat of arms on the nation's flag from 1823–1824 referred to the federation as the Provincias Unidas del Centro de América (&quot;United Provinces of Central America&quot;) but its 1824 constitution, coat of arms and flag called it the &quot;Federal Republic of Central America&quot; (República Federal de Centroamérica / Centro América). It is also sometimes referred to in English as the &quot;United States of Central America&quot;.

The republic consisted of the states of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. In the 1830s an additional state was added, Los Altos, with its capital in Quetzaltenango, occupying parts of what are now the western highlands of Guatemala and the Mexican state of Chiapas. During the period of 1838–1840 the federation dissolved in civil war.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Part of [[Wikijunior]] [[Wikijunior:South America|South America]] project'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Simón Bolivar''' was a leader in the South American struggle for independence. Bolivar was born to a prominent family of Basque origin in Caracas, Venezuela in 1783. He studied law in Madrid, returned to South America in 1809 and in the following year took part in a revolutionary uprising in Caracas. In the struggles of New Granada, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru for freedom from Spanish rule, he was the most outstanding General of the armies, being proclaimed The Liberator, and when in 1819, New Granada and Venezuela were consolidated into a republic under the name of Columbia, Bolivar was made president. In 1823, he became dictator of Peru, but he held the office only two years. The region of Alto (Upper) Peru took his name as Bolivia, yet its constitution, which he framed, excited in the minds of his enemies the fear that he wished to make himself perpetual dictator over Columbia, Bolivia, and Peru, and he lost some of his influence. He held the presidency of Columbia until a few months before his untimely death in 1830. He was an admirer of the American Revolution, but his vision of a similarly unified South America was never realized. Still, his was a great and noble endeavor: liberating and organizing the civil affairs of the many nations which today view him as their founding Father.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==

Pashto has been written in a variant of the Persian script (which in turn is a variant of Arabic script) since the late sixteenth century. Certain letters were modified to account for sounds specific to Pashto. Until the spelling system was standardized in the late eighteenth century, the representation of these consonants varied greatly. The Pashto alphabet, which has more vowel sounds than either Persian or Arabic, represents the vowels more extensively than either the Persian or the Arabic alphabets.
With the adoption of Pashto as a national language of Afghanistan, some revisions of the spelling system have been made in the interest of clarity.

Pashto has a seven vowel system. There are retroflex consonants sounds pronounced with the tongue tip curled back--which were presumably borrowed from nearby Indo-Aryan languages. Unlike other Iranian languages, such as Persian, Pashto allows consonant clusters of two or three sounds at the beginning of a syllable.

==How many people speak this language?==

There are over 9 million speakers of Pashto in Afghanistan alone.

==Where is this language spoken?==

Pashto is one of the national languages of Afghanistan and widely spoken in Pakistan. Major Pashto speaking cities are Peshawar, Karachi, Dir, Swat, Mardan, Swabi, Dherai, Quetta, Kandahar (Qandahar), Kabul. 

In Afghanistan, Pashto is the first language, the Persian dialect spoken natively in the north and west. Because of the political power of the Pashtuns, however, Pashto has been a required subject in Dari medium schools, and as an official language has been one of the languages of the government. For practical purposes, however, Pashto is the language of business and higher education, and so Persians learn Pashto.

Pashto is taught at very few universities in the United States and Canada. The most consistent program offered is at the Diplomatic Language Services in Arlington, Virginia

==What is the history of this language?==

Pashto is one of the East Iranian group of languages, which includes, for example, Ossete (North Ossetian, south Ossetian, Caucasus Soviet Socialist Republic) and Yaghnobi (Tajikistan).  Some of the historians links it to 

East Iranian and West Iranian (which includes Persian) are major sub-groups of the Iranian group of the Indo Iranian branch of the Indo European family of languages.  Indo-Iranian languages are spoken in a wide area stretching from portions of eastern Turkey and eastern Iraq to western India.  The other main division of Indo- Iranian, in addition to Iranian, is the Indo-Aryan languages, a group comprised of many languages of the Indian subcontinent.

There are two major dialects of Pashto: Western Pashto  spoken in Afghanistan and in the capital, Kabul, and Eastern Pashto spoken in northeastern Pakistan also known as Yousafzai Pashto. Most speakers of Pashto speak these two dialects. Two other dialects are also distinguished: Southern Pashto, spoken in Baluchistan (western Pakistan and eastern Iran) and in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

The variation in spelling of the language's name (Pashto, Pukhto, etc.) stems from the different pronunciations in the various dialects of the second consonant in the word; for example, it is a retroflex [sh] in the Kandahari dialect, and a palatal fricative in the Kabuli dialect. The major dialect divisions themselves have numerous variants. In general, however, one speaker of Pashto readily understands another. The Central and Southern dialects are more divergent. The Kandahari dialect is reflected in the spelling system, and is considered by some to be the &quot;standard&quot; for that reason.


The first written records of Pashto are believed to date from the sixteenth century and consist of an account of Sheikh Mali's conquest of Swat. In the seventeenth century, Khushal Khan Khattak, considered the national poet of Afghanistan, was writing in Pashto. In this century, there has been a rapid expansion of writing in journalism and other modern genres which has forced innovation of the language and the creation of many new words.

Traces of the history of Pashto are present in its vocabulary. While the majority of words can be traced to Pashto's roots as member of the Eastern Iranian language branch, it has also borrowed words from adjacent languages for over two thousand years. The oldest borrowed words are from Greek, and date from the Greek occupation of Bactria in third century BC. There are also a few traces of contact with Zoroastrians and Buddhists. Starting in the Islamic period, Pashto borrowed many words from Arabic and Persian. Due to its close geographic proximity to languages of the Indian sub-continent, Pashto has borrowed words from Indian languages for centuries.

Pashto has long been recognized as an important language in Afghanistan. Classical Pashto was the object of study by British soldiers and administrators in the nineteenth century and the classical grammar in use today dates from that period.

In 1936, Pashto was made the national language of Afghanistan by royal decree. Today, Dari Persian and Pashto both are official national languages.

===Early History of Pashto===

According to G.P.Tate, the author of &quot;The kingdom of Afghanistan&quot;-the first to use Pashto for literary purposes was the famous Pir Roshan in the 7th century. His arch rival Akhund Derweza (1533-1638) was also compelled to use Pashto to arouse his followers against the Roshania movement. Apparently, both the giants exploited religious and mystic sentiments of their followers. The windfall of that movement was the freedom of Pashto prose from the influence of Arabic and Persian languages. 

The most remarkable achievement of that era was the innovation by Pir Roshan that made the writing of Pashto easy.  He realized that Pashto could not be written in Arabic script owing to some of its peculiar sounds.  He therefore, invented 13 alphabets to represent those sounds.  Some of these alphabets patched up vocal differences between the hard and soft dialects of Pashto as well. 

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==

Pashto has an extensive written tradition. There are a number of classic Pashtun poets, most notably Khoshal Khan Khattak.  Modern Pashtun written literature has adapted those modern western literary forms, like the short story, that match forms from traditional Pashto oral literature. Pashtun folk literature is the most extensively developed in the region.  Besides stories set to music, Pashtun has thousands of two and four line folk poems, traditionally composed by women. These reflect the day to day life and views of Pashtun women.

Khushal Khan Khattak came to be known &quot;The father of Pashto&quot;.  Apart from his unsurpassed works in verse and prose on various topics including hunting, falconry, medicine and religion, he compiled a deal of information on the history of Pashtoon.

Then comes Syed Rahmatullah alias Rahat Zakheli(1884-1963), the harbinger of modern Pashto prose.  He introduced or revived almost every genre of the time in Pashto.  He wrote the first imaginary novel, published in 1912 under the title of &quot;Mah Rukh&quot;.  His short story &quot;Konda Jeenae&quot; was published in the newspaper AFGHAN in 1917.  It was the first but a perfect short story.  He compiled history and grammar as well in Pashto. 

In the political arena, Bacha Khan gave due attention to the renaissance of the Pashto language, literature and culture.  He encouraged and sponsored Pashto poets and writers. Professor Hafiz Mohd Idrees wrote a novel &quot;Peghla&quot; which is considered the first comprehensive novel in Pashto.  Said Rasul Rasa, Abdul Rahim Majzoob and Fazal Haq Shida modernized Pashto literature by introducing odes and some other genres of English literature.  At this juncture, Pashto took a sharp turn to change its oriental style into a European style.

Here's some stuff that doesn't fit anywhere.  It's too advanced, but this pass I'm only sorting, not culling.


LINGUISTIC SKETCH

Pashto distinguishes two grammatical genders as well as singular and plural. There are generally two nominal cases in Pashto, although the vocative case is still used with singular nouns. Case is marked both with suffixes and with changes in the vowel of the noun stem and stress. Verbs agree with their subjects in person, number, and grammatical gender as well as being marked for tense/aspect. Past tense transitive sentences are formed as ergative: in these, the object rather than the subject agrees with the verb, and weak pronoun objects rather than subjects are omitted if they are not emphatic.

Word order, which is very rigid, is subject-object-verb. As the language of an Islamic people, Pashto also contains a high number of borrowings from Arabic; among educated speakers, the Arabic plurals of borrowed nouns are frequently maintained.

In the whole book you don't mention three of the most important cities of Germany: Frankfurt am Main (Frankfurt Rhein/Main); Hamburg; München (Munich)
--&gt; Frankfurt is the most important city of economic in Europe (without the British Isles)!, We have the 7th biggest airport in the world and within the next years it will grow a lot!...
--&gt;Munich has the original Oktoberfest which is celebrated all over the world today
--&gt;Hamburg has a very important harbour (Frankfurt has no real harbour but in Frankfurt we have more fresh fish every day than Hamburg, funny, isn't ist)
There are much more things you don't mention in the book

Yes I realize that, however I have a plan, but currently it is under wraps, you'll just have to wait and see. -- [[User:German Men92|Je suis]] 23:33, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== new ===
The keyword new allocates the memory for an object and calls one of the constructors.
 class C{
 }
 C c = new C();
This allocates as many bytes, the class C needs for one instance. Then the standard constructor without arguments is called.

If the memory allocation fails, an OutofMemory Exception is thrown. The memory is allocated on the garbage collector heap.

A class can have multiple constructors with different argument lists. The matching constructor is chosen.

A class can have an own allocator and deallocator. If they exist, they are called instead of the gc allocator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to Smooth? ==

How do I make the texture smooth?  I can only generate polygon-looking molehills regardless of the settings in the Materials: Map To tab.  What am I missing?

: The second step of the tutorial (now) has the answer you're looking for.  Also, please sign your comments with &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; when you're done so we know who's asking what. - [[User:Sendoshin|Sendoshin]] ([[User talk:Sendoshin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sendoshin|contribs]]) 19:39, 3 March 2011 (UTC)

== Great job! ==

This is a great module. It seems complete and is easy to read and follow. Thanks for contributing this module to Wikibooks. [[User:Tannersf|Tannersf]] 04:04, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

== Incomplete Instructions? ==

With Blender 2.41 on Ubuntu Dapper the result is a flat plane.  Is this tutorial complete?  Which version was it originally written for?

:I think the above post &lt;nowiki&gt;[Great job!]&lt;/nowiki&gt; was rediculous. Probably so intended. 
:Yes, this tutorial seems incomplete. Probably never finished, which is a shame.

::I see a few people have had problems with getting just a flat plane. I (another noob :) ) too have had this problem, but then I discovered I accidently added a plane instead of a grid. Therefore, I had just the four corner vertices to displace, which means nothing happens at all (since the texture is scaled to the size of the object). As soon as I replaced the plane with a grid (delete the plane, add a grid, set smooth, apply the material to it) I got a wonderful bumpy surface :-)

::In other words: read the tutorial carefully and make sure you add a GRID!

== Misty Instructions ==

&quot;By adding some Mist in the World buttons, adding a Cloud Texture to the World and make it blend from white to gray we could get something like this:&quot; At this stage of the tutorial I cannot follow this kind of description. Please explain in more detail.

:Yes, please elaborate how to get the effects.  It was possible to add a cloud texture to the World, but this noob does not yet know how to &quot;blend [it] from white to gray...&quot; so my render shows the fog creeping over the hills as it does in the example.[[User:WindsorSpring|WindsorSpring]] ([[User talk:WindsorSpring|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/WindsorSpring|contribs]]) 16:24, 3 March 2011 (UTC)

::Experimenting led to finding the &quot;Mist&quot; button on the &quot;Mist/Stars/Physics&quot; tab among the World buttons.  Options in that tab, &quot;Start,&quot; &quot;Dist,&quot; &quot;Height&quot; and &quot;Misi&quot; give control of the effect.  Setting each around 0.3 to 0.4 gave results similar to the example.  We just have to figure how to word this seamlessly into the article.[[User:WindsorSpring|WindsorSpring]] ([[User talk:WindsorSpring|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/WindsorSpring|contribs]]) 16:59, 3 March 2011 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Basketball game.jpg|thumb]]
Basketball is a sport enjoyed by millions of people around the world. Children and adults of many nations are fascinated by the high speed action and hype that surrounds the sport. It started in America, but has spread to other countries around the world who have shown us that everyone can compete. There are big players and small players, skinny and heavy players, and people of many nations playing.  If they can do it, so can you.  Some players have even come to America to compete in the NBA (National Basketball Association). Some of these players are Dirk Nowitzki (Germany), Steve Nash (Canada), Yao Ming (China, figure 0.1), and Manu Ginobili (Argentina). So become part of the hype and learn the history, rules, and sport of basketball!!

American college basketball rules can be found at [http://www.ncaapublications.com/Uploads/PDF/2008_m_w_basketball_rulesed71624b-af81-422d-80d8-4da5977ca70b.pdf 2008 NCAA MEN’S AND WOMEN’S BASKETBALL RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS]

==Basic Play==

[[Image:Basketball.jpeg |thumb|left|100px|1.1 A basketball.]]
[[Image:Basketball clipart hoop.gif|thumb|150px|1.2 A basketball hoop.]]
[[File:Basketball court metric en.svg|thumb|175px|1.3 Basketball Court]]

Basketball's basic concept is easily understood.  The objective is for your team of five put a basketball (figure 1.1) through a hoop (figure 1.2) on the opposite side of the court.  While trying to score on this hoop you are also trying to defend your hoop on your side of the court (figure 1.3).  You must dribble or pass (not walk with) the ball to your team mates to get down the court (see Skills chapter) and must try to put the ball in the basket before twenty-four seconds has passed.  If you don't the other team will receive the ball.  You can refresh the twenty-four seconds if you miss the shot and your team gets the rebound. The missed shot must hit the rim to reset the twenty-four second shot clock. There are three types of shots you can make for points.  The first type is a two-point shot.  If you shoot the ball inside the three point line, it is worth two points.  The second type is a three-point shot, if you shoot beyond the three point line your team gets three points.  The third type is a foul shot, if you are fouled when going up for a shot you shoot the number of free throws (from the free throw line) for the number of points you could have received if you made the shot.  For example, if you are shooting a three point shot and get fouled you get three shots from the foul line.  If you were shooting a two point shot, you get two shots.  If you go up for a shot, get fouled, and make the basket, you get the points regularly received for making the shot, plus one free throw.  Free throws are worth one point each.  If someone is fouled, the person who fouled them gets one more ''personal'' foul, and the team gets one more ''team'' foul.  You are eliminated from the game when you have 6 fouls.  If you foul somebody when they are not shooting, it counts as one more personal and team foul.  If your team commits more than three fouls, the person fouled gets to shoot two from the line.  The game is played out in quarters (12 minutes each), and every quarter your number of team fouls goes back to zero.  You also cannot go outside the court boundaries (yellow in the diagram), or the ball is given to the other team.  Another general rule is once you go over center court, you cannot go back over (this is called ''over-and-back'' or a ''backcourt violation'').  Do not stay in the box below the basket for more than three seconds, this is called ''three in the key'' and will result in your team giving the ball up.  You must be past center court after eight seconds, or you will turn the ball over (these eight seconds are also counted on shot clock).  Stepping out-of-bounds, backcourt violations, three in the key, and the ball being stolen (taken away from you by the other team) are all forms of turnovers (giving the other team the ball).  When on defense, you cannot touch or hit another player (this will result in foul shots). Be careful not to stay in the square below the basket for more than three seconds (not illustrated).  This is called ''Defensive Three Seconds'' and will result in the other team shooting a free throw and receiving the ball.  This is the basic way of playing basketball so make sure you know these rules.  Some of the topics (such as free throws) will be covered more in depth later.

==History==

Now that you know a little bit about the game itself, you should hear the history of how the game came to be.  What would you do if you had to invent an indoor game for the harsh New England winter?  Dr. James Naismith (figure 2.1) was faced with this predicament when the Head of Physical Education told him to make a game for a class of eighteen men.  The original game was a nine-on-nine version of basketball using peach baskets on sticks as hoops, and soccer balls as basketballs.  Naismith's liked his game because it focused less on brute force and more on skill, so that anyone could have a chance and become good at it.  He devised the following set of thirteen rules:

# The ball can be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.
# The ball can be batted in any direction with one or both hands, but never with the fist.
# A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it.
# The ball must be held in or between the hands. The arms or body must not be used for holding it.
# No shouldering, holding, pushing, striking or tripping an opponent.
# A foul is striking at the ball with the fist.
# If a side makes three consecutive fouls it counts a goal for the opponents.
# A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the ground into the basket and stays there.
# When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field and played by the first person touching it.
# The umpire shall be judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.
# The referee shall be the judge of the ball and decide when it is in play in bounds, to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time.
# The time shall be two 15-minute halves with a five minute rest between.
# The side scoring the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner.

The first game was believed to have been played on December 21, 1891 in the Springfield, Massachusetts YMCA and the first official game was in the same place January 20, 1892.  From humble beginnings in a YMCA gymnasium, the game has come to reach a huge audience of hundreds of millions of people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Blood==

The blood transports food, proteins, blood cells, gases, water, minerals and waste products around the body.

Blood contains:

* '''Plasma''' - a straw coloured liquid in which the blood cells are suspended and the other components of the blood are dissolved.
* '''Red blood cells''' - these are red and doughnut shaped for a large surface area. They carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues as oxy-haemoglobin (the oxygenated form of haemoglobin). They do not have a cell nucleus.
* '''White blood cells''' - these are colourless cells with a large cell nucleus. They defend the body against disease by engulfing micro-organisms (bacteria and viruses) and producing antitoxins and antibodies.
* '''Platelets''' - these are fragments of cells and very small. They do not have a cell nucleus. They form blood clots at the site of injuries. Clots protect the body from further infection and blood loss.

[[Image:gcsebiolblood.gif]]

== Blood vessels ==

Blood flows from the '''arteries''' through the '''capillaries''' and into the '''veins'''.

Both arteries and veins have the following layers in their walls:

* An inner '''endothelium''' or lining.
* A layer of a special type of muscle called '''smooth muscle'''. The layer also contains numerous elastic fibres.
* An outer fibrous layer.

Arteries have relatively thick walls compared  many with veins. They also have a smaller bore or '''lumen'''.

[[Image:gcsebiolvessels.gif]]

Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels. They are only one cell thick.  They allow the exchange of water, materials such as salts, food etc., gases and a small amount of white cells between the blood and the tissues.

==The circulation of the blood==

The circulation of the blood carries oxygen, water and nutrients to the body and carries away waste products and carbon dioxide. 

The schematic diagram below shows how the blood flows around the body (a schematic diagram shows the principles of the circulation but is not anatomically accurate).

[[Image:gcsebiolcirc.gif]]

The circulation of the blood in mammals and birds is known as a '''double circulation'''. The right ventricle pumps blood through the lungs where it is oxygenated and the left ventricle pumps the oxygenated blood around the body.

[[Image:gcsebiolcirc2.gif]]

You need to know the following names of arteries and veins:

* '''Aorta''' - the big artery that comes out of the left ventricle.
* '''Pulmonary artery''' - the big artery that comes out of the right ventricle.
* '''Vena cava''' - this refers to the big vein that connects to the right atrium. It has two sections the superior vena cava that drains blood from the top part of the body and the &quot;inferior&quot; vena cava that drains blood from the body below the heart. To make the sections clear it is often said that there are two &quot;vena cavae&quot;, the superior vena cava and the inferior vena cava. Either learn the names of the two sections or, when you draw the heart put the arrow to the vena cava as close to the heart as possible.
* '''Pulmonary vein''' - the vein that is directly attached to the left atrium.

==How the heart works==

Due the continuous cardiac cycle which takes an approximate second, the heart is the fastest and the strongest muscle in the body. The strongest external muscle is the tongue, however the heart is much stronger.   

The heart works in three stages:

# Blood flows into the atria.
# Both atria contract at the same time, forcing blood into the ventricles.
# Both ventricles contract at the same time, forcing blood through the pulmonary artery and aorta.

The heart valves ensure that the blood goes in the correct direction, they stop backflow. When the atria contract the valves between the atria and the ventricles open passively and the high pressure in the arteries keeps the valves between the ventricles and the arteries closed. When the ventricles contract the valves between the ventricles and the atria shut and the valves between the ventricles and the arteries open.

[[Image:Diagram of the human heart (cropped).svg]]

The net effect of the action of the heart is as follows. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atrium and flows into the right ventricle where it is pumped through the lungs. In the lungs the blood is oxygenated. It then flows into the left atrium and on into the left ventricle where it is pumped out at sufficient pressure to reach every part of the body. The atria have thin walls and act as reservoirs, the ventricles have thick, muscular walls and act as pumps. The valves in the heart prevent backflow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The nervous system==

The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord and relay neurones (Central nervous system) and peripheral nervous system (sensory neurones and motor neurones). The nervous system lets the organism react to the environment and surroundings and coordinate their behaviour.

==The senses==

Sense organs contain '''receptors''' that are sensitive to '''stimuli'''.  Typical stimuli are due to changes in chemical composition, mechanical effects, heat, sound and light. Stimuli are the changes that are detected. Receptors detect the change.

There are five sense organs that are studied at this stage, the '''nose''', '''tongue''', '''eyes''', '''ears''' and '''skin'''.  

The nose has smell receptors that are sensitive to a wide range of chemical stimuli. Much of what is called 'taste' is actually smell; the range of flavours in food is very limited if the nose is blocked.

The tongue has taste receptors that are sensitive to chemical stimuli. There are four basic tastes: bitter, salt, sweet and sour.

The eyes have receptors that are sensitive to light, the ears have receptors that are sensitive to sound and the skin has receptors that are sensitive to temperature, touch, pressure and stretch.

===The eye===

[[Image:Gcsebioleye.gif]]

Light from the surroundings enters the eye through the pupil.  It is focussed by the cornea and lens so that it forms an image on the retina.  The cornea performs crude focussing and the lens performs active, fine focussing.  The eye is filled with transparent liquid (the humours).

The '''iris''' controls the size of the '''pupil''' and so controls how much light gets into the eye. In bright light the '''circular muscles''' in the iris contract, this makes the pupil smaller and allows less light into the eye.  In dim light the '''radial muscles''' contract, this makes the pupil larger and allows more light into the eye.

The lens changes shape to allow the eye to focus on things at various distances. The shape of the lens is changed by the action of the '''ciliary muscles'''.  The ciliary muscles form a circle that is attached to the lens by the '''suspensory ligaments'''.  To focus on distant objects the ciliary muscles relax which pulls the suspensory ligaments tight and makes the lens thinner.  To focus on nearby objects the ciliary muscles contract which allows the suspensory ligaments to relax so that the lens forms a more spherical shape.

The retina contains cells that are sensitive to light. These cells are called '''rods''' and '''cones'''.  

The rods are more sensitive than the cones but do not provide any colour information.  In dim light our view of the world is largely provided by rods and appears as a black and white image.

There are three types of cone and these are each sensitive to different colours of light. The cones are especially densely packed in the part of the retina called the '''fovea'''; this dense packing means that the fovea is most sensitive to fine detail in the image.

The part of the eye where the '''optic nerve''' enters is called the '''blind spot'''.  The blind spot does not contain any light receptors (it has no rods or cones).

===Hearing===
Sound is nothing more than vibrations in the air around us. The ears are the sensory organs that can distinguish both the pitch and loudness of those vibrations. Vibrations enter the ear through the auditory canal. The vibrations cause the tympanum, or eardrum, to vibrate. These vibrations are picked up by three tiny bones, commonly called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The last of these bones, the stirrup, transmits the vibrations to the oval window. Vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid filled cochlea of the inner ear. The cochlea is lined with tiny hair cells that are pushed back and forth by these pressure waves. In response to these movements, the hair cells produce  nerve impulses that are sent to the brain through the cochlear nerve.

===Balance===
Your ears contain structures that help your central nervous system maintain your balance. Withn the inner ear just above the cochlea are three tiny canals at right angles to each other. They are called semicircular canals because each forms a half circle. The semicircular canals and the two tiny sacs located behind them monitor the position of your body. The semicircular canals and the sacs are filled with fluid and lined with hair cells. At the head changes position, the fluid in the canals also changes position. This causes the hair on the hair cells to bend. This action, in turn, sends impulses to the brain that enable it to determine body motion and position.

==Neurones==

Neurones are cells that are specialised to transmit '''electrical impulses''' around the body.  They consist of three principal components: the '''dendrites''', the '''cell body''' and the '''axon'''. Each neurone has its own '''nucleus'''. (The US spelling of neurone is &quot;neuron&quot;).

[[Image:gcsebiolneurone.gif|left|350px|thumbnail|A neurone]]

{{clr}}
There are three types of neurone: '''sensory neurones''', '''relay neurones''' and '''motor neurones'''.

Neurones connect to other neurones by means of '''synapses'''.  Nerve impulses travel down the axon to one side of the synapse where the electrical signal causes chemicals to be released. These chemicals diffuse across the gap and generate an electrical impulse in the neurone on the other side of the synapse.
[[Image:gcsebiolsynapse.gif|left|350px|thumbnail|A synapse]]

{{clr}}
==The Central Nervous System==

The central nervous system is composed of the '''brain''' and '''spinal cord'''. It contains huge numbers of neurones that process data and provide output signals to '''effectors''' in the body.

The effectors are muscles and glands that respond to signals from the central nervous system. Muscles respond with movements and glands respond by '''secreting''' substances such as fluids and chemicals. Effectors produce a response to change.

===Reflex arcs===

The nervous system has many '''reflexes'''. These are automatic responses to stimuli. Very quick responses are managed by '''Reflex arcs'''.  A reflex arc consists of the following components:

* Stimulus
* Receptor
* Sensory neurone
* Relay neurone
* Motor neurone
* Effector
* Response


[[Image:gcsebiolpain.gif|left|thumb|500px|Pain reflex: a painful stimulus causes a muscle to contract automatically]]A typical reflex arc called the &quot;pain reflex&quot; is illustrated.

In the pain reflex the stimulus is mechanical damage, the receptor is a &quot;pain receptor&quot;, the pain receptor generates an electrical impulse in a sensory neurone which creates an electrical impulse in a relay neurone, which in turn creates an electrical impulse in a motor neurone. The impulse in the motor neurone stimulates a muscle, which is an effector, and this creates movement away from the painful stimulus as a response.

Another reflex is the &quot;patellar&quot; or &quot;knee jerk reflex&quot; where a blow beneath the knee-cap makes the leg straighten. The contraction of the pupil in response to bright light is yet another reflex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Flat URL's for TextGen.aspx ==

An Umbraco plugin that allows use of /umraco/TextGen.aspx via flat URL's.


=== Install ===

The plugin can be downloaded from http://www.darren-ferguson.com/code-bank.aspx 

* Copy the DLL's to your Umbraco bin directory.

* Add /TextGen to the key umbracoReservedPaths in web.config (this var is a comma delimited list).

* Add the following three keys to your web.config

&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;add key=&quot;fmEnableDebugging&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;add key=&quot;fmDebugPath&quot; value=&quot;C:\TEMP&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;add key=&quot;fmTextGenRequestPath&quot; value=&quot;/TextGen&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
You can configure debugging to be on or off as you wish. If the debug path is not found  System.IO.Path.GetTempPath() will be used.

To change the flat URL prefix to call TextGen.aspx with, substitutr /TextGen in steps 2 and three for a prefix of your own choice.

4. Add a httpModules section as a child of system.web as follows (append if you already have this section).

&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;httpModules&gt;
		&lt;add type=&quot;FergusonMoriyama.TextGenRewrite,FergusonMoriyamaTextGenRewrite&quot; name=&quot;TextGenRewrite&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;/httpModules&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Usage ===

You can now generate an image using a flat url as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/textgen/This%20is%20a%20pen/arial/48/000000/ff0000/1.aspx&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
The url segments of the parameter are the parameters to textgen.aspx. and are pretty much self explanatory.

=== support ===

Please mail me at df at darren hyphen ferguson dot com if you encounter any bugs or issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Plant structure==

Plants are divided into flowers, stems, leaves and roots with root hairs. A generalised plant is shown in the illustration.

[[Image:gcsebiolplant.GIF|right|thumbnail]] The '''stem''' provides support for the leaves and flowers. It also allows water and food to travel both up and down the plant.

The '''leaves''' make the food for the plant. '''Photosynthesis''' takes place in the leaves.

The '''roots''' anchor the plant in the soil and take up water and salts (mineral ions) from the soil. The '''root hairs''' provide a large surface area for water and salt uptake.

The '''flowers''' are reproductive organs. They attract insects that carry pollen from one plant to another. This process of transferring pollen from plant to plant is known as pollination.
{{clr}}


===The structure of the leaf===

Leaves produce the food for the plant. The structure of the leaf is shown in the illustration. The leaf has prominent '''vascular bundles''' that contain two types of tubes, the '''xylem''' tubes and the '''phloem''' tubes. The leaf has the following parts 

[[Image:structureofaleaf.png]]
&lt;ol&gt; 
 &lt;li&gt; The leaf has a waxy cuticle to stop it losing water and drying out. &lt;li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; The epidermis is a protective layer of cells and contains no chloroplasts. &lt;li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; The palisade layer contains the most chloroplasts as it is near the top of the leaf. The chloroplasts contain the pigment chlorophyll.&lt;li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; The palisade cells are arranged upright. This means the light has to pass through the cell lengthways and so increases the chance of light hitting a chloroplast and being absorbed. &lt;li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; The spongy layer contains fewer chloroplasts, enough to catch what the palisade layer cannot absorb.&lt;li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; The spongy layer has air spaces to make it easier for gases to circulate in the leaf.&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; The vascular bundle &quot;vein&quot; provides the leaf with water via the xylem vessels. Food, such as sugar, made in the leaf is transported in the phloem vessels to the rest of the leaf.&lt;li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; The stomata (stoma - singular) are tiny pores that allow carbon dioxide to enter the leaf while oxygen leaves the leaf.&lt;li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Guard cells can open or close the stomatal pores to regulate how much gas can enter or leave the leaf. At night the pores close, opening in the daytime.&lt;li&gt;

Leaves are green because they contain the green pigment called '''chlorophyll'''. Chlorophyll is used in photosynthesis. &lt;p&gt;

[[..|GSCE Science/Photosynthesis]] for more details

===The structure of flowers===

(Note: flowers are not covered by many GCSE boards)
[[Image:gcsebiolflower.gif|right]]Flowers are composed of:

* Sepals - these are arranged underneath the flower and are typically green.
* Petals - often brightly coloured to attract insects.
* Stamens - stalk-like filaments that have anthers at the top which produce pollen. Pollen contains the male gametes.
* Pistil - contains one or several carpels that contain the ovaries with ovules, the female gametes. Sometimes the carpels are merged. A stalk called the style leads upwards from each pistil and is topped by a sticky stigma that receives the pollen.

The pistil is the bottle shaped structure. A pistil can be composed of one or many carpels and a flower can have several pistils.

==Plant growth==

Plant growth requires glucose produced by photosynthesis and energy produced by respiration. It also requires minerals obtained from the soil.  Plant growth is controlled by plant hormones called '''auxins'''.

===Auxins===



===Minerals needed for plant growth===

There are three minerals that are essential for plant growth: '''phosphates''', '''nitrates''' and '''potassium'''. Small quantities of '''iron''' and '''magnesium''' are also needed, especially for the production of chlorophyll.

'''Phosphates''': used in photosynthesis and respiration.
'''Phosphate deficiency''': purple leaves and small roots.

'''Nitrates''': used in the production of amino acids. Amino acids are combined to make proteins. 
'''Nitrate deficiency''': yellowing of leaves and poor, stunted growth.

'''Potassium''': maintains electrical potentials and helps enzyme action. 
'''Potassium deficiency''': leaves become yellow with spotty, brown, dead areas.

== Where can I put a thesis? ==
I wrote an academic thesis in 1997 on &quot;Water management in Indonesian cities&quot;. I'd like to put it on the web somewhere so it can be of use to others. I'm sure many others would like to do the same with their own theses. Is there a Wiki site where I can do this? Of course this would leave it open to editing by others, but that's okay - it would be possible to use a permanent link to the original version if necessary. 

Wikisource appears not to be suitable unless it's &quot;verifiably published&quot;; Wikibooks is supposed to be NPOV and it would take a lot to establish, on a case-by-case basis, where a thesis was NPOV. 

The only thing I can think of is to post it to a relevant [http://www.wikicities.com Wikicity]. Any other ideas? (A &quot;Wikithesis&quot; even?) --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:07, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

:Some recent discussion has occured about perhaps using Wikiversity as a place for content of this nature.  At the moment there is no reasonable place to put content like this, although you might want to look at the [[wikicities:c:academia|Academia Wikicity]].  Another place to put something like this is on [[s:|Wikisource]], but that may present some problems.  I would suggest if you plan on putting something like this on Wikisource to first contact the [[s:Wikisource:Scriptorium|Scriptorium]] (their equivalent of the Staff Lounge) for guidance on how to proceed. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:55, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

I have some very limited experience with controlling pumpstations supplying feedstock to waste fermenting/consumption/conversion basins and tanks.  If you provide a link to the paper or email me a copy of it with applicable information and permission to publish under the site FDL I will help you or put it on the site myself and build an intitial course development action plan and work breakdown structure and task list and then review paper for techniques or inspiration regarding the lunar base prototype golden path variations for fan in and fan out points.

[[Wikisource:Wikisource:What is Wikisource?|Wikisource:What is Wikisource?]]: &quot;Some basic criteria for texts '''excluded''' from Wikisource are: ... '''Original writings''' by a contributor to the project&quot;. The rule is there to prevent contributors from using Wikisource to write anything that they want. So, do not put your own thesis on Wikisource.

If you do not use http://acamedia.wikicities.com, then you might want to start a wiki ''only'' to hold your thesis. Try '''[[Wiki:WikiFarms]]'''. For example, you could probably use http://pbwiki.com or http://www.wikispaces.com. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:35, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks all. I've just created the [[wikia:scratchpad:Development and Sustainability|Development and Sustainability  Wikia]] and it occurred to me that my thesis would fit quite well in there. This doesn't solve the problem for everyone, but if anyone has a thesis on issues relating to sustainability or development, then they're certainly welcome to put it there. 

:The next issue is: how do I convert from a Word document to Wiki markup? If there's no easy solution, I can save it as HTML, which should work. There's over 300 footnotes in the whole thesis, so it's important that the translation handles footnotes. 

:I'll check [[wikicities:c:academia|Academia Wikicity]] as well - maybe link it from there. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 16:46, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

== Further improvements to be made ==

I put here some (edited) comments that I have raised in a discussion with Rob Horning as I'd like to air some of these issues to a wider audience:

When I came to wikibooks, it was clear that it had an identity crisis, which had seen a number of splits - the cookbook, wikijunior and wikiversity in particular had all been split off in some way. There was no standard naming convention, so each book looked separate rather being as part of a whole. There were many remnants of former days as a multilingual site, a lot of latent vandalism (eg a number of pages still needing ass pus or still having been damonized), and serious difficulties navigating to find what books are actually worth reading. This, through the efforts of a number of editors, is improving (although I'm sure not as fast as we'd all like).

There is still some way to go - personally I very much do see wikijunior and wikiversity as being part of the remit to host and develop textbooks, and I would love the rifts to disappear. The Cookbook namespace should disappear too. Hopefully making wikibooks look like something to be proud of will bring them into the fold. For me, we also need to resolve textbooks such as [[Knowing Knoppix]] and [[Gardening]], which have already been published, but which are clearly textbooks that would not be out of place here had they originally been started here. To my mind wikibooks is the wikimedia project you look at for textbooks (and if it isn't, it bloody well should be). They are not appropriate for wikisource (which does not appear to cover things even remotely looking like textbooks), yet provide a welcome addition to wikibooks.

Other issues to resolve are to make things more user-friendly. I have already changed the Wikibooks portal (along the lines of what is done for other wikimedia projects), though this probably deserves more work as it is the first thing many first-time visitors see. I have started to redraft the Help namespace content using modified wikipedia content - this too needs to be completed. The main page, no doubt, can be improved further.

In summary, there is much to be done to make wikibooks look like a good place to develop new textbooks - but that is the noble aim. If we can succeed, we can help bring down the cost of textbooks generally, which will greatly help education throughout the English-speaking world, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:59, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

:I would say that Wikibooks is still in a state of trying to find its own identify, although it has calmed down to a more leisurely pace of discussion and more reasonable concensus opinions being reached, as opposed to when Jimbo went in and effectively put in a VfD for three Wikibooks with a strong opinion that the content should have been deleted much earlier (I still wish he would have used the VfD forum for that instead of the Staff Lounge).

:Wikiversity and Wikijunior both are examples of new Wikimedia projects that are using Wikibooks merely as server space to try and find their own way as independent projects.  Wikiversity started out as one idea and has grown to become apparently something very different from the initial suggestion, although it is clear even from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity&amp;oldid=32014 this very early edit] that Wikiversity was to be about teaching courses and not just writing textbooks, as apparently the Foundation board seems to want it to become.

:The point here is that Wikibooks has been used repeatedly as the starting point for brand new project ideas and I've worn this point down so hard that few people are even listening to me, thinking I'm crying wolf all of the time.  These new projects keep getting added to Wikibooks, as is evidenced by [[Wikilanguages]] and [[Wikitopia]].  I have tried to resolve this situation by not only letting new users know that this is inappropriate, changing policies and &quot;welcome&quot; messages, but also trying to get a place to put concepts like this.  Wikicities is a place to put them, but it feels hollow as it really isn't the same as Wikimedia sister project.  Creating whole new projects has turned into such a nightmare that I've proposed that the Wikimedia Foundation board simply adopt a new policy toward them:  '''No new Wikimedia projects will ever be created.  Thank you for your suggestions but please look elsewhere.'''

:That puts us here on Wikibooks in a huge bind as these projects keep getting created, and some of them are very worthy ideas that perhaps even as regular Wikibooks participants we feel should be done somewhere but just not here on Wikibooks.  There really is no place to put this sort of content, and it gets to be very harsh to simply say &quot;goodbye&quot; to Wikiversity through a VfD instead, with defenders not really having a leg to stand on in their defense.

:Defining exactly what is a Wikibook can help.  If the definition is clear, it is easier to convince others that content should or should not be developed here.  It would also help us to cut down the VfD page to only occasional discussions rather than a huge dynamic process that it currently is.  Of course, Wikipedia ought to be pretty clear as to what is an encyclopedia article, and they still have problems with even whole book-like projects getting started there and moved to this project, so I guess this is something that all of the Wikimedia projects have to live with.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:41, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

=== Some users debate the word &quot;textbook&quot; ===

They are not appropriate for wikisource (which does not appear to cover things even remotely looking like textbooks), yet provide a welcome addition to wikibooks.''

I must wonder what that means. Some Wikibookians seem to have a different understanding of the word &quot;textbook&quot; than I do. Even the [http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=*&amp;Query=textbook dict.org definitions of &quot;textbook&quot;] give no consistent idea. In November 2005, I requested that someone define &quot;textbook&quot; in Wiktionary. [[Wiktionary:textbook]] now defines it as &quot;a formal manual of instruction in a specific subject, especially one for use in schools or colleges&quot;. I still believe that the word &quot;textbook&quot; simply means &quot;book of text&quot;, thus ignoring any [[Wiktionary:idiomatic|idiomatic]] meaning. Thus Wikibooks, [[Wikisource:Main Page|Wikisource]], and http://novelas.wikia.com all have textbooks.

But I expect to find '''instructional''' textbooks at Wikibooks (unless they are encylopedias or dictionaries). However, I also expect to find previously published instructional textbooks at Wikisource. I cannot understand how to make &quot;textbooks&quot; inappropriate for Wikisource. I would prefer having ''Knowing Knoppix'' at Wikisource, and also having a modified version here at Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:41, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

:I think you have a misunderstanding here. The word textbook does not mean &quot;book of text&quot;. The wiktionary definition does not appear to be too wrong, although how &quot;formal&quot; the book has to be, I'm not sure. Incidentally, although I believe Wikibooks should accept all textbooks (under the generally understood definition), we also have content which I wouldn't propose removing that are not textbooks - eg cookbook, games runthroughs, other leisure books such as chess, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:28, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

::No, Kernigh is closer to right.  The idea that textbook==school book is a fairly modern idea.  An older definition is a textbook is a text-  a non-fictional work.  Schoolbooks are a proper subset of that.

::Secondly, several of the books you mentioned ARE school books.  A cookbook is in a culinary class.  Chess is frequently taught in logic classes, my logic grade in 4th grade was based on a chess tourney.  Game design is now a college major at several schools, game runthroughs would be a schoolbook for that.

::Thirdly-  wikibooks is not, and never has been, merely schoolbooks.  Its scope is instructional resources, which is slightly more inclusive.  Basicly any non-fiction work which instructs or teaches you about a subject (with a small list of exceptions as listed in the what is wikibooks).  There has never been a consensus to restrict wikibooks to merely schoolbooks.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 21:39, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

=== Returning Wikijunior and Wikiversity to Wikibooks ===

Books like [[Wikijunior Kings and Queens of England]] are not on a bookshelf, but I plan to add them. Also, I think to move [[Wikijunior]] to &quot;Wikibooks:Wikijunior&quot; (leaving the redirect), as it is a project page, not a book itself.

As for the [[Cookbook]] namespace, I think that is only a technical situation, not a political situation. The separate namespace allows searches inside only that namespace. It also improves linking, as [[Cookbook:hamburger]] (lowercase h after colon) and [[Cookbook: Hamburger]] (space after colon) are always [[Cookbook:Hamburger]].

The difficult situation, in my view, is '''Wikiversity''' &amp;ndash; I started a [[MetaWikipedia:No to Wikiversity|No to Wikiversity]] page at 9 December 2005. I was interested in a [[MetaWikipedia:Wikiversity/Modified project proposal]], hoping to lean Wikiversity toward coordinating learning groups instead of hosting instructional material. That page and '''[[Wikiversity]]''' both state that &quot;Wikiversity is a centre for the creation and use of free learning materials and activities,&quot; which I hope are group activities. Much of the [[Wikiversity#Recent Material]] seems ready for a move to the new wiki &quot;en.wikiversity.org&quot;.

However, much older Wikiversity material, such as [[Wikiversity:School of Mathematics]], consists of books that should remain at Wikibooks. These could form the basis of a collection of university-level textbooks, analogous to [[Wikijunior]]. I have not considered the problem of the overload - &quot;Wikiversity&quot; being used for two different concepts, a new wiki and a section of Wikibooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:48, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

:I will note here that I knew this was going to be a major issue once en.wikiversity was established.  Trying to decide what content should go to the new domain is going to be a huge issue and a point of contention in some areas.  I've also seen recently an effort to list the various Wikiversity schools as navigation links from several Wikibooks.  I don't see an explict problem with that, but it does make trying to decide what exactly is meant by the term ''Wikiversity'' sometimes hard to define.  I don't think that you can even find two people to agree on what exactly is Wikiversity, and that is going to be something that will continue with Wikiversity for years to come.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:13, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

::Notice that what is hosted at the Wikiversity wiki will not be a problem for the Wikibooks community unless they fear the competition for web traffic.  It is always possible for the Wikibooks community to place a copy of a Wikiversity improved text with proper attributes on their bookshelves.  It is also possible that Wikibooks will do such a good job of hosting mature textbooks that Wikiversity processes will choose to work with Wikibooks to present mature textbooks to the public at large independent of Wikiversity.  We probably do not need or want random readers traipsing through our learning processes.  It is extremely unlikely, at least in the engineering school, that Wikiversity will mandate to its learning communities that they will be allowed no local textbooks or class notes for active local markup free of harassment or oversight by outsiders.  I would advise Wikibooks participants to be cautious in attempting to mandate monopolistic practices to participants at Wikiversity.  Participants there can always fork your FDL'ed draft textbooks to another server and then link to it from Wikiversity.  At that point even recourse to &quot;Jimmy says ...&quot; becomes complicated.  There is no benefit to hosting texts in progress at Wikimedia servers if some local control over the materials is not possible for Wikiversity participants.  Notice that the bandwidth requirements for a single study group of three to three hundred participants placed randomly around the globe accessing a single draft text is probably well within the capacity of a typical U.S. dsl connection.  It might be productive to consider ways in which friendly cooperation with Wikiversity, rather than outspoken opposition, would benefit Wikibooks.   There is no reason Wikibooks could not evolve to be a much better library or repository or archive with a higher aggregate quality of material; while some of the draft or book in progress stuff tended to start at Wikiversity and then migrate to Wikibooks as it matures.  It then becomes the Wikibooks editorial board or community or quality review peoples responsibility to decide when some draft book is good enough to be hosted at Wikibooks instead of attempting to tell others they cannot use their own ebooks.  Some of the gunk weeding would thus be offloaded to Wikiversity while Wikibooks would inevitably gain substantial proofreading and participant testing from people using their more mature products.  It is highly unlikely that Wikiversity will end up hosting Wikibooks not used and marked up within learning processes.  Too much liability and risk from vandals attacking at nooks and crannies not subjected routinely to Wikiversity policy scrutiny.  So what is the big deal if a section of Wikiversity participants copy a Wikibook for their local markup and then leave in it the obscure Wikiversity archives for future sections?  Eventually someone either decides the accumuluated changes should be merged into the current edition delivered to public at large via Wikibooks and does so or the class scribblings remain indefinately in the archive for future students or internet archeologists or Wikiversity participants themselves decide to recover the disk space.  Where is the threat to Wikibooks that has some believing they should control exclusively the etexts that Wikiversity participants choose to use or markup? [[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 12:26, 7 April 2006 (UTC)
:::It isn't &quot;control&quot; but rather needless duplication of effort regarding forking content from other Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia and Wikibooks.  If it is already hosted on a Wikimedia project, it is easily accessable and you can even help with developing the content.  Under some very limited circumstances can I see that you might want to fork some content.  For example, the [[Japanese]] has a section called [[Japanese/Reader]] that has forked some Wikimedia content.  In this situation, however, some significant added value is being done because hints and notes are being added in English (for otherwise all-Japanese content) and some effort is being done to integrate the content into the lessons as well.  And for this purpose it doesn't have to be the most up to date content either.  Forking a Wikibook because it doesn't have the POV that you like is hardly an excuse to want a local copy on a seperate project, unless you want to have a strong POV and are making it a private website independent of the Wikimedia Foundation for that purpose.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:49, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Etiquette]] ==

I've posted a comment on [[Wikibooks_talk:Etiquette]], to try to &quot;resurrect&quot; this guideline. I think the policies and guidelines on Wikibooks need work in general, so I'm starting here. I'd appreciate your thoughts and comments. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 10:02, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

:I would like to go further than etiquette. Wikipedia has numerous instances of bullying such as personal attacks, edit wars etc. This is not happening yet at Wikibooks, we are all friends here so far and behaviour seems to be almost exemplary.  I would like to propose that every bookshelf has an administrator who is an Editorial Executive. The role of the executive would be to:

:* Nip Wikipedia bad behaviour in the bud; to spot edit wars and personal attacks at the outset.

:* Provide help on the correct structuring of a Wikibook.

:[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:36, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

::Hmm, well I tried to resurrect this proposal for the very reason that I observed behaviour that was far from exemplary, believe me. I probably didn't give the greatest response myself, but that's neither here nor there as regards the proposal itself. A collaborative social space needs to set its codes/rules/values, whatever you want to call them - otherwise it is vulnerable to being manipulated by bullies. I'm not sure an editorial executive is the best way, but, as we develop, we do need processes that go beyond simple admin duties. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 12:18, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

:::How do we go from here to a policy proposal?  I would propose that:
::::* Any edit war is immediately taken &quot;offline&quot; and moved onto a separate page for discussion. The text should be reverted to the state it was in before the start of the edit war until resolution has been achieved.
::::* Personal comments ranging from &quot;idiot&quot;, &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;ignorant&quot; upwards are outright banned. Perhaps a one week suspension for the offender. We discuss the content of books at Wikibooks. It is essential to stop personal comments instantly - zero tolerance.
::::* On each bookshelf there is an Editorial Executive who is an administrator who oversees the above.
::::* There is an Editorial Board of 5 Users who can be asked to intervene after a 2 week delay if the actions of the Editorial Executive are called into question.

::::Civilisation thrives under the rule of enlightened and liberal law. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 20:14, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

Unfortunately, I fear this is all too complicated. Also the two problems with [[Wikibooks:Etiquette]] are that it stresses some negative behaviours, particularly at the top (eg no personal attacks, rather than the positive - be nice and understanding), and that it is too long. At present, administrators are free to use their discretion in disputes in which they themselves are not personally involved, subject to re-affirmation of their approach by other administrators. Or, to put it another way, we have no firm policy. Where is the problem that needs resolution here. I appreciate that you'll be reluctant to cast a stone, but without concrete examples of where there is a problem at present, it is difficult to know how to resolve the issue, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:29, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

:Wikibooks is a pleasant and creative environment but I have peered into Wikipedia and feel strongly that we should prevent the sort of behaviour that occurs over there from happening here.  Just look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration requests for arbitration page], its the Wild West out there! I believe that two simple policies will stop this sort of thing from happening here: 

:*If edit wars are immediately taken off-line onto a special administration page until resolved the heat of the situation would be dissipated immediately. No one would win by edit warring, the only way forward would be discussion and compromise. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Editing_policy Editing policy] and add a comment.

:*If there is an Executive Editor on each bookshelf who can keep the peace, stamp on personal attacks and arbitrate at an early stage then the situation will never arise where two contributors go to war or seriously offend each other. There will always be a third party to break any deadlock. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:No_personal_attacks No personal attacks policy] and cast a vote.

: I know that this all seems overblown given that we are fairly civilised at Wikibooks but if we put these two simple ideas into effect we will always be civilised. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:44, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Overhaul of the Bookshelves and [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves]] ==

This is a subject that has been laying around on the back burner for some time, and does get brought up from time to time as well.  In trying to fix the Ontology of Wikibooks, I've already made some changes in how you can look up a specific Wikibook.

One of the common practices here on Wikibooks is the grouping of Wikibooks into bookshelves.  From a rough count of the total number of independent Wikibooks on this project right now, we have about 700 different books that can be organized.  About 200 or so are missing from the current alphabetical listing, from a rough guess based on my preliminary review of the bookshelves I did before starting this post.  The current count on the alphabetical list is 564 books.  BTW, anybody notice the change on the main page where I listed the total number of Wikibooks?

By any measure this is a huge number and is going to require multiple levels of topical structure just to be able to put all of these books into a systematic organization.  And this is something that is desperately needed as I've seen several duplicate modules also come up, and some very good Wikibooks that have been lost in the shuffle, especially noting some of the poor candidates or even winners of the Book of the Month contest, when clearly superior books were available.

Even if you assume about 10-20 books per bookshelf, that is still going to be over 30 different bookshelves on Wikibooks, which is clearly overwhelming.  And some topics like computer related books have some perhaps disproportionate represenation compared to what you would normally find in a typical library situation.

To further complicate matters, some books are listed on multiple bookshelves.  There may be valid reasons why this is done, but we need to come up with some more clear guidelines on how this is done and when it can occur.

Basically, I consider the current bookshelf organization to simply be broken.  I am not suggesting that they be deleted, but a holistic reorganization oriented not just toward a few bookshelves but to how they are all put together should occur.  The suggestion of &quot;departments&quot; that have collections of bookshelves is perhaps a good way to form super categories, but subcategories and other organization methods need to be dealt with as well.  And to decide on how many levels of organization do we want?  Finding a book shouldn't be a process of clicking through a dozen pages just to find the content you want.

We also want to group similar books together.  That is the whole point anyway, where you can look up related books that are all together on the same &quot;bookshelf&quot;.

There are a number of &quot;wikibooks&quot; that are also bookshelves in disguise.  I've recently renamed [[Biology]] and [[Physics]] because they really were bookshelves to a bunch of independent books and not the main page of a Wikibook.  Currently there is no policy, instead I'm just '''being bold''' and trying to fix a problem as I perceive it.  This is indeed something that needs to be addressed in terms of policies, and something I've run into before with my wikibook [[Serial Programming]] that has inadvertantly turned into a bookshelf.  (I call it my wikibook because I'm the principle author of most of the modules and I started it).  The Serial Programming book has even gone up for VfD because of the way new modules were added when people treated it as a bookshelf.

Based in part on our content, here are some signicant divisions (or departments) to consider for the very top level of organization:

;Society:Humanities, History, Arts, Social Sciences, Law, Economics, Business, and Politics (books like [[Voter's Guide]] and something about politcal organization)
;Science:Mainly &quot;hard&quot; sciences, but thing like Biology, Physics, Chemistry, and those things that have to do with scientific enquiry in general.  The distinction with social sciences may at times be tricky, but that is often grouped with humanities anyway even at many major universities.  Where to put Mathamatics is an issue to deal with here as well.
;Engineering:This is one I'm not entirely sure if this is the way to do it.  There are many engineering books and there is a bookshelf just for engineering, but I was thinking of generalizing the category to include even the computer books (aka software engineering).  The title of this category is debatable as is even the organization, but basically those books that deal with how to create stuff.  Computers could perhaps be the category, but then engineering is kinda left out in the cold by itself or improperly placed.
;Games:Game guides are such a major part of Wikibooks that it really deserves its own top level distinction, and they will need to develop their own standards as a community of game guide developers anyway.
;How-to:Another top-level distinction if for no other reason than Wikipedia has a specific policy about this topic, as does Wikibooks.  There are also enough different How-to books that sub-categories of these books (aka seperate bookshelves) can and should be created as well.
;Miscellaneous:No matter how hard we try, some books simply defy any attempt to categorize them.  Even the major classification systems like Dewey Decimal and the Library of Congress have general categories to dump in books they really don't know what to do, which BTW is the reason for the 003 and 004 codes for computer books that were totally unanticipated by the Dewey Decimal system except in the general anything goes category.

I know there are many other opinions on this topic, so add to the discussion and let's see if we can come up with a reasonable top level organization for Wikibooks.  I'd like to keep the number of top-level categories down to between 5 - 10 significant major subdivisions, as having too many more than that is simply too confusing to people coming to Wikibooks for the first time.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:13, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

:I'd like to propose combining engineering and science into one shelf-  science and technology.  After all, engineering is just applied science.  Under that we could have subsections-  natural sciences, math, engineering (possibly further broken down in the future), computer science, IT, etc.   It makes a more logical sense to me, especially as some things in the two have so much overlap (is discrete math under scinece-&gt;math or engineering-&gt;computer science?).  This way they'd all at least have the same top level bookshelf.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 21:45, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
::There really are enough different technology books that they deserve their own shelf seperate from science books... and enough science books as well to stand on their own.  This is one area that Wikibooks is particularly strong in right now.  I would like to &quot;reunify&quot; the computer books somehow, as they do seem to be splintering into seemingly infinite groups.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:47, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

:: Agreed. Comp Sci vs Comp (software) Engineering are another two topics that should go on the same bookshelf. On the other-hand, I'd prefer few large bookshelves over a &quot;tree&quot;. Yes, we can subdivide and subdivide until we got very specific bookshelves, but there is a point where it just won't work. And given the current content, I think 5 or so bookshelves is all we need right now. Basically, I'd like to avoid books on more than one bookshelf. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:19, 30 March 2006 (UTC)
:::So you are saying that you don't mind having over 200 Wikibooks on one bookshelf?  Because that is the resulting number of books that are going to be listed, and precisely why there are so many computer and information technology bookshelfs:  So many books were listed that it became a blur about what what was really there.  I'm not talking about a category or bookshelf with just one or two books, instead I'm talking perhaps 30-50 as a target size.  With this number of Wikibooks, that is still going to be about 20 different bookshelves, and that is the point I was trying to make earlier.... it needs a better organziation.  And bookshelves now need groupings, at least if this more moderate goal is to be realized.  This is not a theorhetical discussion, but actual content that is so diverse and so deep that it needs to be organized into more than just a small handful of flat categories.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:47, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

:::The books can still be &quot;treed&quot; and kept on one page, by use of sections. Using sections also takes away a disadvantage of large bookshelf pages: Navigation - individual sections get links in the TOC, so one can easily jump to whereever they need to go. I think an easy way to add new books for users unsure where to put them would be useful as well - one of the reasons so many new books go unshelved is because a lot of new users don't know where to put it. Perhaps a notice on the edit page when creating a new page in the main namespace could help with this, i.e. something like &quot;Things to do when creating a new book&quot; that lists some things that need to be done with new books (as well as providing easy links, so users don't have to search for the proper pages):
:::*Add this book to a [[Wikibooks:All_bookshelves|bookshelf]].
:::*Place this book in a proper category.
:::*List it on the [[Template:New|list of new books]].
:::And so on. This could probably be made into a template and used in a few other places, as well.
:::As far as organisation of the shelves goes, a single large &quot;Science &amp; Technology&quot; shelf could probably encompass all of the needs in that category, with proper subdivisions.
:::The Dewey codes were mentioned as well; perhaps we can try to keep each section to a specific number/range and put that in the section header, so people can search by number if they want to, or provide a seperate template with section links, but using the numbers as the link text. --[[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 00:43, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

== April 1st Madness ==

April 1st tends to bring out the best in editors, and candidates generally worthy of the Uncyclopedia.

I noticed that [[Quantum field theory]] was just proclaimed as the Wikijunior New Book of the Quarter, and I would venture to guess that other interesting things are happening as well.  If you could simplify that topic for 8 year olds, that would indeed be quite an interesting text!  BTW, I'll give it a day in the sun before the real winner, [[Wikijunior Languages]] is put up instead.

If you see anything else that is worthy of a chuckle, please post it here, and then this will be archived to [[Wikibooks:Bad Jokes and Other Deleted Nonsense]] at some point in the near future.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:23, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
: Ok, this was my idea :) I was updating BOTM, COTM and Wikijunior book of the quarter and I noticed that book called &quot;Languages&quot; won the vote, although it was not linked to the voting page and I could not find it using Wikibooks search. I came into idea that if I can't find any of books from the voting page, I would play a joke and make something funny. Of course, this is just for April 1st, but Wikijunior people should learn a lesson from this case and 1) give normal links at voting page 2) make all Wikijunior books easily available from Wikijunior main page and perhaps 3) instroduce a rational naming convention. I and Kernigh also noticed that this vote is not protected from sockpuppets as anyone can vote. There were cases of people having one edit - the vote. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:50, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, the standards perhaps should be improved to at least the 20 edit minimum.  I think I'll make that change for the next round of voting that finishes in July.  The reason why the book isn't linked to the page is because it hasn't been created yet!  This is a vote to decide what the next book should be, not what the next one is that we are working on.  A few Wikijunior books have been started outside of this process, but how they are going to be linked is currently up for debate at the moment.  In the past, Wikijunior books created out of process were speedy deleted, which I felt was inappropriate as it was not really policy.
::As far as a rational naming convention, they are independent Wikibooks, so according to [[WB:NP]] there should be a title of a book, which has always been Wikijunior xxx for the current set of books either under development or proposed if they have been created early.  Are you suggesting something else?  Wikijunior is not the name of the book, but rather the bookshelf.  In this case I might support a move of [[Wikijunior]] to [[Wikibooks:Wikijunior]], but I wouldn't make that move yet.  Wikijunior is also being used as a project namespace, and there may be as valid if not more so reasons to start a formal Wikijunior namespace than was used for the Cookbook namespace.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:27, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

::: There was a rush earlier today to update the [[Main Page]] for April. If I recall, I was on IRC with [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] and [[User:Jguk|Jguk]]. We managed to update BOTM and COTM, but I suddently had to disconnect from the Internet before anyone changed the Wikijunior new book. I would not have supported using [[Quantum field theory]] as the new book, but it might be a sign that Wikijunior is becoming more popular and successful. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 19:57, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

== Policy about books dealing with illegal activity ==

So far, the response from the Wikibooks community has been to attack individual Wikibooks, but no very consistant project-wide policy has yet been adopted.  In almost every case when illegal activity is documented in a Wikibooks, it has come up on the VfD forum and has been eventually deleted as well.  Another couple of Wikibook just came up today that brought this to my attention: [[AIM Password Cracking]] and [[Rip a karaoke cd]]

Together with the [[Manual of Crime]], [[Drugs:Fact and Fiction]], and [[Computer Hacking]], this shows that content of this nature is going to be added to Wikibooks anyway, so we need to try and have some solid guidelines over what is acceptable and what is not.  I don't think a simple disclaimer saying &quot;don't try this at home if you don't want to be arrested&quot; is going to be sufficient, or any similar statement.  This has been discussed in other forums before, but it does need to be made clear.  See also [[w:Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors]] for some other insight to content of this nature.

I don't support a general no reverse engineering policy, nor do I support a blanket ban on books that ''might'' be shown to encourage illegal activity.  That is a policy that if used agressively can remove half of the books on this project and can be abused by rogue administrators.  That is perhaps why this hasn't been covered or dealt with in the past.

How do you get rid of books that are a criminal's how-to book but keep books that are genuinely useful for security advise and protection?  What role to disclaimers have in books like the AIM Password book have, and is that sufficient or should it be stronger?  Do we want to have, even in a small corner of Wikibooks, an equivalant of [[w:Paladin Press|Paladin Press]]? If not, why not, and what policies should be in place to make sure that doesn't happen?  If we should have a &quot;bookshelf&quot; of this sort of content, how do we keep it under control and avoid liability problems for Wikibooks contributors? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:21, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

Please explain to me why it it is appropriate to &quot;get rid of books that are a criminal's how-to book but keep books that are genuinely useful.&quot; This cannot be done while maintaining a neutral point of view. Why not have a [[Manual of Crime]]? Any information can be misused. The censorship of information should not be the answer to the problem of misuse. Who's law does wikibooks follow? This is very serious problem...  I believe I have the answer to all our concerns. I propose a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four#Ministries_of_Oceania Ministry of Truth] (Minitrue for short) to set legal standards and to oversee the production of wikibooks so that they may always be harmonious and neutral, this should prove to be a doubleplusgood thing.--[[User:Hapa|Hapa]] 20:44, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

:As far as the Manual of Crime is concerned, it was a Wikibook that had many people participating in its development and was brought up on both the [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/The Manual of Crime|Votes for deletion]] page and the [[Wikibooks:Requests for undeletion/The Manual of Crime|Votes for undeletion]] page.  All told the main module had over 167 different edits and at least 4 different attempts to recreate the content and 15 sub-modules involved, so this has been a rather contentious issue here on Wikibooks.  Along the way even Jimbo himself was brought into the discussion (he discouraged the content, but was not going to personally get involved) and the eventual decision was to remove the content.  Surprisingly I stayed quite on this issue myself.  I bring this book up precisely because of the fact it was a large Wikibook and involved multiple contributors, and it didn't die easily here on Wikibooks either.

:This issue is a far cry from the Ministry of Truth, like the Foreign Minister of Iraq claiming that the Iraqis were invading New York City (in 2002) only to discover a U.S. Soldier walking into his studio in the heart of Bagdad, and how his credibility was shot to pieces.  Yes, I've read 1984, but that is not what we are talking about here.  This is discussing how to break laws of varying degrees, and a strong concern that the main focus of Wikibooks is about writing textbooks for educational purposes.  Having Wikibooks famous for being a modern alternative to Palidin Press is going to, at the moment, seriously detract from our ultimate goal of providing serious textbooks to educational institutions.  I have long been an advocate for the idea that Wikibooks is more than just textbooks, and there are a number of books here that are not strictly about teaching a class at a formal educational institution.  Still, I am suggesting that there is potentially a place for some of this content, and that a line needs to be drawn from the blatant advocation of illegal activity.

:Mind you, I didn't delete [[Rip a karaoke cd]] either, but brought up some strong concerns in the discussion page and even brought up some issues on your user page.  Thank you for addressing some of those issues, and I think we can come to a compromise on what you have written.  Other participants at Wikibooks are going to be reviewing what you wrote as well, and they will come to their own conclusion.  This whole discussion is about the general policy and perhaps even where that policy change should take place.  Another discussion about this issue (I had to do some serious digging to find it) took place here: [[Wikibooks talk:Policy/Vote/Archive 1#A directly enumerated WikiBooks policy]]  Other subsequent discussion also covered some of these issues.

:When this issue was brought up earlier, it really didn't come to a conclusion, and the issue has been swept under the rug.  I'm hoping here that perhaps some other contributors to Wikibooks might be interested in resolving this issue and helping to come up with some sort of policy statement about this sort of content.  Or at least to get the current mindset of contributors to Wikibooks about this topic.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:12, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

----
Currently, it seems that a &quot;how to rape&quot; guide is out-of-scope for Wikibooks, but a &quot;how to prevent rape&quot; guide is in scope. (For those of you who recall the now-deleted Wikibooks ''Manual Of Crime'', I refer to a generic &quot;how to rape&quot; guide, not the particular guide from the MOC.)

My problem with &quot;how to rape&quot; is that I would perceive as a soapbox for the promotion of crime. Then certainly &quot;how to prevent rape&quot; is a soapbox for the prevention of crime, and [[Guide to X11]] is a soapbox for the usage of the X Window System. This is a reference not to the policy of [[WB:NPOV|neutrality of point of view]], but to '''[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]'''.

In particular, this policy contains too much ''Enwikipediathink'', because it is among our earliest policies, and most of the Wikibookians at that time came from Wikipedia. The policy is actually a derivative work of [[w:Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not]]. It does not work well on Wikibooks, because Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia. Rules like &quot;Wikibooks is not for developing new Wikimedia projects&quot; and &quot;Wikibooks is not a general repository for nonfiction works&quot; do not ban anything specifically. &quot;Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider&quot; is misleading because Wikibooks ''is'' a free wiki host and webspace provider, even though this provision is not for personal pages. &quot;Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works&quot; is an unfortunate contraction of &quot;original works of fiction or literature&quot;, because in fact each Wikibook is an original work, though it is not an original work of fiction. In fact each Wikibook is an original work of [[wikt:literature|literature]], so that is another problem. &quot;Wikibooks is not censored for the protection of minors&quot; was hastily copied from Wikipedia (in late 2005, I think) and has its own bias because it assumes that older persons do not require any protection from offensive content.

Actually, [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] remains the doubleplusgood policy at Wikibooks. It is a good attempt at describing the scope of the existing contents at Wikibooks. However, users keep adding irrelevant pages like [[The Storyteller by Martha Whittington]]. The ultimate effect is that Wikibooks is good for new users who join to work on existing books, but bad for new users who join to start new books. In my case, I worked on [[Guide to Unix]] before starting a similar [[Guide to X11]]. Thus, '''I propose to overhual [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]].''' --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:19, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

:We need a &quot;top shelf&quot;! Books with adult content should be permissible except where they violate a legal concept of incitement. 

:If I were to write &quot;a U235 bomb is much easier to construct than a plutonium device because it can be made from a sphere with a hole drilled that can receive a large cylindrical plug of uranium that can simply be dropped into place&quot; I have merely disseminated neutral information. If, after the above, I write &quot;the uranium storage facility at Alma Ata is isolated, patrolled by two guards and currently has a faulty telephone connection to the local police station&quot; I am inciting terrorist behaviour.

:Perhaps the simplest way out of this problem is to create an &quot;Adult Wikibooks&quot; that activates child protection on Firewalls etc. and which can contain any book that would be permissible in the European Union - the EU being literate, secular and liberal and yet not a global superpower.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:11, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

::This is something that may have some very strong merit.  The Open Directory Project has precisely this sort of &quot;walled off&quot; area that is not linked to the main page and has an explict policy that other areas of the project can't link into the adult section (although it is considered acceptable to go the other way).  For the not so faint of heart and those that can handle genuine adult web content, here is the link:  http://dmoz.org/Adult

::Don't say I didn't warn you.  That is genuine adult-only content there.  Although it is not explictly stated anywhere on any Wikimedia project, pornography has long been forbidden from Wikimedia projects and was one of the motivations to remove the [[Naturism]] Wikibook.  It really takes a special kind of editor to wade through most of the raw garbage that ends up being called &quot;adult-only&quot; and to try to come to terms with enforcing policies and having some basic content standards but yet permit this sort of content.  We have been lucky in many ways because writing a Wikibook really is very hard work, and most adult-only content is usually excluded from Wikibooks simply because it violates other Wikibooks policies, such as being a copyright violation, being a work of fiction, original research, or NPOV issues.  The Naturism book was unusual because it passed all of those restrictions but it failed the Jimbo test... Jimbo didn't like it.  It also had problems because some of the photos depicted what could be arguably child pornography.

::We certainly don't want to allow anybody being able to go from Wikijunior to some adult-only content with just a few easy steps.  I'm also questioning the need for this sort of seperation, but it at least is a reasonable and rational proposal.  In this regard, I would almost prefer a seperate Wikicity (Wikia project now?) to allow people to set up their own policies in an adult-only content environment.  I highly doubt you will get board approval for an adult-only Wikimedia project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:53, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

:Why not create an &quot;Mature Minds Only&quot; sort of tag, &lt;MMO&gt; which could be used to mark controversial content.  Some sort of firewall could be setup to protect those who would not, or should not see such content. it would be of like putting the Playboys behind the counter instead of in the candy aisle. [[User:RobinH]] said ''&quot;EU being literate, secular and liberal and yet not a global superpower.&quot;'' That doesn't seem to be very NPoV. Don't underestimate the illiterate, religious, conservative super powers.  The fact that the EU may be (arguably) literate, secular, liberal, and a minor global power, does not automatically give their censors superior judgment. I don't think that our personal biases should be used for the basis of creating policy.--[[User:Hapa|Hapa]] 20:09, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

::I don't see how banning the advocation of illegal activity is necessarily a major point of contention.  I guess it is for some people who feel that you should be free to say anything and everything.  As mentioned on the [[WB:WIN]] talk page, the How to Rape book is discouraged because of the fact it does encourage breaking a law that is usually described as a felony in most legal juristictions around the world.  Some kinds of activities are permitted in some countries and not in others, like some of the illicit drug usage, but even here if you are writing on how to evade law enforcement when doing that activity in places where it is illegal, it should be put on the list of banned types of content.  This shouldn't be something difficult to understand, nor something that can easily be abused by an administrator, and is a clear line that IMHO is something that people should not cross on this project.  That in many cases all that is needed is to clean up the content to avoid the out right advocacy of breaking laws, there can be some content that is so blatant on this issue that it would simply have to be deleted.  We live in a society of laws, and those laws are necessary for us to even have this project at all.

::As for other content that is meant for mature audiences, creating the firewall is going to be harder than you might think.  If you have a link on mature content that goes ''to'' a Wikijunior module, it is really only two clicks away for a younger child to get there via &quot;What links here&quot;.  The only real way I can see you doing a proper firewall is to put it on a completely different domain and project.  And that brings up the whole issue all over again over what sorts of content would be put onto the &quot;mature&quot; domain and what would be kept here.  A seperate bookshelf for mature content is not going to be sufficient.

::I want to seperate the discussion, however, between allowing mature content and those books that advocate breaking laws.  Deciding wheither to allow adult-only content on Wikibooks is something that can be decided seperately and independently, as you can have some content that is not intended for use by children but is not advocating illegal activity, and there is some content that doesn't matter if children see it other than the fact that it encourages you to break various laws.  Like ripping CD-ROMs in violation of the DCMA and how to avoid getting caught sharing the music on P2P networks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:21, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

:::To follow your lead, limiting the discussion to illegal activity with pornography excluded, the real problem is &quot;who's laws&quot;.  I mentioned the EU earlier because it is a loose liason of states so, for instance, anti-terrorist laws are not universal within the EU. But as a contributor pointed out, people from other places might take offence at EU laws being the benchmark. So where is the body of law that defines the content of a book as illegal? Many Wikibooks are probably already illegal in the context of Chinese or Byelorussian law. There are UN guides to what is generally acceptable (ie: what violates fundamental rights etc.) but we would need a full legal apparatus to interpret these.

:::Incidently, as a European, I find sex less offensive than violence so Jimbo's imposition of North American mores seems a little strange.  

:::This whole issue seems appallingly difficult. It seems wrong to ban a book just because it irritates a particular culture (but is a book on cartoons of Mohammed wrong?). The best we can do is create somewhere where we can put things that are genuinely doubtful, whether it is Naturism or terrorism. But where can we put these items? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:20, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
::::I found the cartoons about Mohammed to be incredibly funny.  But on to other matters... Yeah, this is a difficult issue, and a veiled critique of my admin skills was made on Foundation-l when I brought this issue up there.  I was just trying to get some input from other admins about how they dealt with this kind of content on their own projects outside of Wikibooks.  Instead, they came here to Wikibooks, marked up various books for VfDs or speedy deletes, and have chosen to help do the culling themselves.  That is not going to deal with this issue in the future, which was exactly my point.  Jimbo should &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''''__**NOT**__'''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; have to come here to Wikibooks and help decide each and every case.  With over 700 Wikibooks and a rate of growth of about 2 realistic new Wikibooks every day, there is no way a single individual can possibly keep up with this and do the other things Jimbo has to do.  Indeed I can't even keep up with the growth of Wikibooks by myself, nor should any individual be expected to.
::::As far as what laws to follow, I think it is more what I said on the [[A guide to cheating during tests and examinations]] VfD that should apply:  If you feel compelled to need a disclaimer suggesting that the content is for research purposes only, you might as well have considered that you just put a [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]] tag on the page instead.  Indeed, I'm going to do exactly that from now on when I see disclaimers like this, but that is a personal policy and not a general project policy.  If you can't write a book in a way that you would be safe from prosecution or a lawsuit without the disclaimer, then it really shouldn't be in Wikibooks in the first place.  How about this as a general policy?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:50, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

==Proposal for an Editorial Board==

I have put forward a policy proposal for an '''Editorial Board''' for Wikibooks to oversee policies, guidelines and dispute resolution. See:

[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Editorial_board Editorial board]

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:32, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

:We really don't need this yet... if ever.  One of the key things about Wikimedia projects is that we are free from the traditional heirarchy of things like this, and we do have of sorts a de-facto &quot;Editorial Board&quot; anyway in terms of a group of &quot;moderators&quot; that have been elected to help smooth things over try to keep the peace.  Or a group of people who are interested in working with policies and help to make changes to those policies when things aren't working out, such as what has been said frequently here on Wikibooks.

:One of the problems that happens when you get into a strong heirarchy situation is that you also get into the situation where a small select handful of people start to make huge changes, and there is no avenue for appeal.  It also drives large groups away and if you are not careful it can collapse the whole project.

:Wikibooks and other Wikimedia projects are experiments in pure democracy, where your influence is directly proportional to your involvement.  In addition, there really is no restriction as to who can achieve that &quot;status&quot; in terms of who can work on the policies and help set the tone and direction of Wikibooks.  Any active contributor can get involved and help out.

:There might be a point about setting up an &quot;arbitration committee&quot; that can help to independently resolve disputes.  I would prefer the term &quot;moderation committee&quot; that seeks to find a resolution between parties and not necessarily impose a verdict or ruling, such as the common law AbCom that is currently on Wikipedia.  The big concern I would have about setting something like this up is to make it large enough so you don't have a cult of personality controlling the whole project.  The Wikipedia committee in this regard was setup more as a delegation of authority from [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo]] so ''he'' wouldn't have to deal with the day to day affairs of Wikipedia.  Jimbo has come into Wikibooks on occasion to resolve problems here, but he can't possibly keep up with all of the policy changes that have occured on not just on Wikibooks but all of the other projects as well.  Or the &quot;legislative history&quot; over why each of the policies were established.  My fear would be that if you set up a larger arbitration board, the first major dispute that would have to be resolved would be between members of that committee, since it is made up of active Wikibookians.

:There are avenues to help police and work out most areas of conflict on Wikibooks.  None of them are perfect and all of them have been questioned regarding their effectiveness.  The current most active dispute resolution forum is [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]].  An arbitration board would be completely useless in this situation as anybody who really has an opinion on the matter usually raises their voice anyway.  There have been some very tough situations where there are clearly two different schools of philosophy to keep or remove content.  An ArbCom action on the VfD forum would be strong arm tactics and simply not appropriate behavior for anybody on such a committee.  And again it would likly involve members of the committee anyway in terms of who would have started the VfD and other members having a different opinion on what to do with the content.

:The other significant role for an arbitration board is over editorial conflict on actual content.  Wikibooks tends to take things at a slightly slower pace than the other Wikimedia projects, in part because of how difficult it is to simply write a book.  The number of participants on any given Wikibook is also low enough (usually) that any disagreement over content can usually be resolved through the discussion pages alone.  Far more often books are simply abandoned and all you have is somebody coming in and perhaps giving the book a new direction, but nobody really cares because the original contributors are long gone.

:One other huge thing on this proposed Editorial board that may be from a misunderstanding of the role of Administrators here on Wikibooks.  Yeah, administrators seem to have some &quot;stripes&quot; on their shoulder in the sense that they can do a few more things than other users.  But an admin is just another contributor and their opinion should not really hold any more weight than any other Wikibookian, other than they may be slightly more familiar with the already codified set of policies.  To explictly codify an arrangement that gives extra privileges to administrators when none are needed is going to cause additional problems.  On the other hand, if you set up such an editorial board that restricts membership so that no more than one or two administrators can serve on it, with the potential that all of the members of this committee could be non-administrators... that may be something to look into.  On the other hand, we need more admins here on Wikibooks to help with the project cleanup and to help moderate each of us here who are admins.  I'm not prepared to block somebody from becoming an admin simply because they are serving on an editorial board.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:34, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

::I can see that you have thought carefully about this issue and perhaps, in the light of your comments, my proposal is too broad. I started the proposal after looking at [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]]. It worried me that there seems to be no official process for dispute resolution. In Wikibooks there must be a system for saving people from bullying, either personal or through disruption of their creative work. You wrote:

::'''&quot;There might be a point about setting up an &quot;arbitration committee&quot; that can help to independently resolve disputes.  I would prefer the term &quot;moderation committee&quot; that seeks to find a resolution between parties and not necessarily impose a verdict or ruling, such as the common law ArbCom that is currently on Wikipedia.&quot;''' 
:::by late post [[user:fabartus]] adds: recommend you keep same names, your 'moderation committee' sounds like wikipedia's ''mediation committees'', and are a step below and before the ''arbitration committee''.

::We both seem to agree that there should be a moderation committee or editorial board. Where we differ is in powers of sanction. If we take some quotes from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration recent arbitrations at Wikipedia] it can be seen that reason alone might fail:

::''&quot;I have said I believe he suffers from a mental disorder because I think his behavior is only explained with that.&quot;''

::''&quot;I would like to ask the Committee to review the conduct of Messhermit. He seems to bear a personal grudge against me, wikistalking mi edits &amp; accusing me of being an Ecuadorian POV-pusher bent on selling biased Ecuadorian propaganda&quot;''

::This level of trouble does not seem to have hit Wikibooks as yet but I think we should have a process in place to deal with it before it happens. My concern is that a problem will arise (such as those at Wikipedia) that requires arbitration.  It will then become apparent that we need a moderation committee or editorial board but the election will then be about the case in hand and will be heavily influenced by those who are involved in the case and whose behaviour is dubious.

::I have changed the policy proposal to take account of some of your concerns about it being too broad and have removed any reference to promoting Wikibooks or to admin/user composition - see: [[Wikibooks:Editorial board]]. As you have pointed out, the frequency of problems at Wikibooks is fortunately quite low so a single Board could provide the place of final appeal for decisions under any policy.

:::In this regard I wish the stewards would take on a larger role in helping to resolve project disputes as a sort of &quot;circuit court&quot; of moderators/arbitrators for various Wikimedia projects.  In the &quot;old west&quot; of the USA during the frontier days, a judge would travel from town to town on a &quot;circuit&quot;, and come by only every three months to hear what local issues needed to be resolved.  The town couldn't afford to keep a full-time judge, so sometimes as many as 30-40 towns would all share the same judge, generally a retired senator or somebody that was respected in that part of the country.  Something like this can and should be available for all Wikimedia projects, as certainly a forum for dispute resolution where a 3rd party can review what is going on and impose sanctions if necessary.  And stewards do have access to all administrator functions including user blocks, page deletions/undeletions, and desysoping abilities.  In short, they in theory could act and give teeth to their decisions as well, as a judge should be able to.  Having a general Wikimedia group to do this would remove the necessity of having to go through the politics of setting up a committee like this locally until there is enough activity going to the general arbitrators that an additional level of appeals would be useful.  I just don't want to &quot;sit&quot; on an arbitration committe and not been used for a couple of years but still have to campaign for getting the seat.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:50, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

::::I haven't heard of Wikibooks stewards. Do you have any links? Certainly an ad hoc combination of stewards could substitute for an editorial board. I like this idea, it would be less formal. Stewards could be appointed permanently and only be removed for extended absence or misbehaviour. But we do need something vaguely formal, such as an ad hoc committe of stewards, if policies are to be enforceable. I am particularly concerned about bullying and edit wars, these will happen as Wikibooks expands and we need something in place now. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:16, 7 April 2006 (UTC)
:::::The [[meta:Stewards|Stewards]] are not just for Wikibooks, but for all Wikimedia projects.  They are elected by Wikimedia users at large, and are to be general guardians over all Wikimedia projects.  They mainly perform tasks like grant checkuser privileges and creating administrators and bureaucrats on projects that have smaller communities.  It is encouraged for stewards to also be multi-lingual, but not all of them are.  Certainly speaking English is not a critical requirement, although it appears as though all current stewards currently do.  [[meta:Steward policies|Current steward policies]] are not directed toward being a global arbitration committee, but rather to help projects create their own communities instead.  Some of this is just a vision of what they really might be all about, but this is a group of people to draw from that are highly respected Wikimedia user.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:19, 7 April 2006 (UTC)
::::::The stewards are quite general. What about allowing administrators in wikibooks to form the ad hoc committee discussed above? (ie: the committee would be any 3 or 5 administrators who are available). This would provide a formal enforcement apparatus for policies which could be modified later, for instance when Wikibooks becomes much larger or problems arise. My concern is that there is no formal apparatus for resolving problems at present.  Our books represent a substantial effort and it is easy to foresee wrecking disputes in areas such as evolutionary biology, national histories etc. in the near future, as Wikibooks becomes better known. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:04, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

One key problem with a formal policy on resolving disputes is that it encourages people to use it to escalate minor disputes to the highest level possible. That's a key problem WP has faced - and it usually involves coming to conclusions that most favour those who like to engage in disputes and argue their cases rather than make good positive contributions to WP. At present the highest level anyone can bring a dispute to is the Staff Lounge to allow there to be wider discussion. Ultimately, I suppose one of the admins could choose to ban a disruptive user, but I doubt that would happen unless there was clear community consensus for it. In essence, this is not a problem that has happened in WB, and it does not seem worthwhile instituting a whole new bureaucracy to deal with a non-existent problem. Admittedly we could go for a small-scale addition to our approach to state that in the event of a dispute, a steward may be asked to intervene in a dispute that has not been resolved after community discussion to propose a way forward (with possibly the threat of blocks for parties not following the approach suggested by the steward), but that would be dependent on getting agreement on meta to use stewards that way, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 05:57, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

:OK, I am vaguely persuaded that all that is needed is a fall-back, ad hoc committee that can intervene if policies are not respected (see below). [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:57, 8 April 2006 (UTC)
=== A Quasi-Veteren Perspective (from WikiP) ===
Interjection by newly signed up [[user:fabartus]]:
I don't know yet whether I'll be a contributor over here in WikiBooks, but ''I have been '''directly involved''''' in a number of the '''wild west shootouts''' (ahem) over at wikipedia as an ''unofficial mediator'', and want to put forth a few points starting with noting that some of the above commentary is ''somewhat naive and ill-informed''. 
#If the wildwest scenario had any large credence, we'd never get anything done over there. With a million plus topics, and thousands of editors there is just simply statistically more likelihood that strong willed individuals will clash in any number of ways. 
#Now that I've issued that caveat, and framed '''the larger context''', let me add that I've also been dismayed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Mr_Tan#Outside_view at times like this] matter which sucked up endless [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Tsushima_Island Man-hours] at '''the uncheckable behaviour''' of (mostly just) one unqualified and inordinately stubborn editor (There were a few others on the other Nationalistic side as well).
##Edit wars over there are usually POV oriented, not factual disputations.
##IMHO, they most often typically involve individuals who are not yet graduates of anything much, generally immature (juveniles) or excessively strong willed to other causes (dementia?), and I don't see such people as being likely '''to even try to contribute here''', except as vandals &lt;G&gt;. I'll assume your admins can nip that! (In the second link following, an admin of long experience places his interpretation on a different causal factor rebutting me in the July 7th link following. Apologies for waxing literary in the introduction, but that page still contains good food for thought, as the intro goes in particular to address problematic (causal) '''foundation philosophies'''.)
##Mature persons in erudite disputes tend to also be ''politically POV'', s.a disputes over whether this or that heinous alleged event can be documented (var. genocides) or carry overs from differing academic battles in ''fuzzy subjects'' like the humanities s.a. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory ''Democratic Peace Theory''] (note the disputation template is still there 8 months since I was asked in to look at it!) '''This is your more likely danger over here, I would think. You'll never get the gross numbers of contributors here, but are probably particularly susceptible to academics pushing a pet viewpoint rather than the commonly held view in the field.
##Consequently, I've given the matter a lot of thought.  I'd suggested (informally through some back channel posting) at one point [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fabartus/Policy01 (July 7th, 2005, in fact)] that the hot disputes be team mediated by 7 to 10 admins geographically dispersed in time zones. 
##These would be more concrete and official than the '''Ad Hoc idea''' being kicked around here. In concept the idea was that any three (or four) can act as a ''Summary court'' in hot (usually nationalistically or philosophically driven) POV '''Flame wars''' to either allow an ''proposed edit'' or ''disallow an edit'' while locking down the article to any edits not so authorized. &lt;small&gt;&lt;B&gt;(I don't know enough about your typical article evolution to know&lt;/B&gt;, but suspect that the characteristic one or two disputed sentence or phrase revert-revert-revert-revert battles over there are &lt;B&gt;far less likely here.)&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
##The arbitrary 'pool' number  of seven to ten (or better perhaps eleven) is to give geographic dispersal so that a quorum could be reached around the clock so as to allow the articles to evolve. I'd stick with the odd numbers to allow a supermajority vote on matters splitting particularly fine hairs, such as one subgroup of the mediation team is polarized against another subgroups actions or stance. The super-committee can then act decisively if all members are required to cast a definitive binary vote, which would set the editorial content standard on that disputed point thereafter. Such ''anointed findings'', could always review and revote on the matter and reverse themselves.  Alternatively, another layer of appeal can be added within the teams system.
##In sum, in practice the team of admins ('''Fire Brigades''' &lt;G&gt;) would make up '''just one of many'''  combined ''editorial boards'' (moderators) and First level ''mediation committee'', without the danger of a cult of personality of an overall '''editorial board''' setting all policy (btw- That's in part, the job '''delegated to the ArbCom''' by [[user:Jimbo]] over there.) 
##To point out the obvious extension, on topical matters of expertise, the concept could be adapted to have '''content teams''' as the editorial board of such and such a topic, all of whom must have acceptable credentials to some hypothetical '''credentials committee''' and process. This would of course be against foundation issues, which I believe must eventually be made more pragmatic and allow such ''authoritarian influences'' to maintain credibility with the public at large, and in particular with academia. (My teens are forbidden to use Wikipedia as a source because of the casual open edit policy and notorious vandalisms, inaccuracies, et. al.  This will improve some as the new cite and footnoting measures gain greater implementation, but in my personal viewpoint, the locking of mature articles there should be the de facto standard, one that is long overdue.
Hope this helps your needs. 'scuse the signature, some of the processing over here is different. [[User:Fabartus|Fabartus]]//&amp;#91;&amp;#91;&amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;green&amp;quot;&amp;gt;User talk:Fabartus&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;]] 20:38, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

I refactored these next two sections up and made them subsections to keep the thread together.

:One thing that does need to be noted about a difference between Wikibooks and Wikipedia is that the user base is quite a bit smaller here.  And much more so here than on Wikipedia, the users tend to fracture into even smaller groups of what are essentially independent projects in their own right.  Most of the policy discussions lately have been over what new ''Wikibooks'' or new projects would be permitted or not, and otherwise with few exceptions there hasn't been a drag-out fight over content (yet).  That is actually one of the major appeals that I have about working on Wikibooks as opposed to Wikipedia... where one person's opinion is not only valued, but even critical to the project, particularly people who actually do things here.

:In terms of scale, Wikibooks is more like the very small town where we are still trying to flip a coin to determine who is going to be on the &quot;town council&quot;, mainly chosen by those who simply show up and are willing to serve in that position at all.  Big project solutions are going to simply overwhelm the users here, and add needless bureaucracy when it really isn't needed.  This is precisely why I think that a more global approach to an arbitration committee that is organized on the Wikimedia Foundation level (multiple projects) would work much better, because you would get both the expertise as well as be able to help many smaller projects at the same time.  Only when a particular Wikimedia projects gets to the size that you have many able volunteers to help serve on a formal policy board or to do other function do I think that a more formal organization is even needed.

:I've heard the rule of 150 given as perhaps a good thing to point out here.  This is the assumption that when you have a group of individuals that is less than 150 people that you are able to deal with one another on a personal level, and that just about everybody knows just about everybody else.  When the count of individuals exceed that number, it becomes far too complex to keep track of everybody and to get to know all of the individuals involved.  I would dare say that of even moderately active users here on Wikibooks, we are still less than 150 active individual users for the whole project.  Some come in and others leave, but it is not really more than a few dozen.  That does allow some informality that Wikipedia simply can't afford right now.  Wikipedia has more than 150 active administrators alone.

:It is interesting to note how governmental systems seem to grow from the grass roots on up, and seem to evolve as the number of individuals increase.  In this regard it is useful to have a roadmap for what you eventually want to have the social organization look like when you get to these larger numbers.  Indeed a successful organization of individuals is largely how they handle the transition phases when they start to outgrow one level of organization to deal with a bigger group of individuals.  The other possible outcome is to splinter off and start independent groups.  Indeed, Wikibooks is exactly what happened there, where a bunch of Wikipedia users were &quot;kicked out&quot; of the main Wikipedia projects to form a much smaller independent project.  And for good or ill, that is now happening with Wikiversity as well.  In a way, this is a good safeguard to help maintain a community spirt, as it keeps the number of active individuals low enough for communication to occur.  Wikibooks doesn't need something like the Signpost just to keep track of what is going on within the project, for instance.

:I find it facinating how Wikipedia is dealing with the growth in the number of active users, and at some point in the future I think this is going to be something that will be of some significant importance.  Mark my words here though, until the number of active users go above about 200 there really won't be the need to have all of these seperate committees and arbitration boards.  When the number of active users gets to that point, it will not only be useful, but absolutely needed.  I appreciate the discussion for that future date, but please don't try to impose anything on Wikibooks that this project isn't really prepared to deal with, or really needs right now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:33, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

::The &quot;small town&quot; model is very apposite. I have been persuaded that, for the moment, all we need is something ad hoc. '''If''' anything goes wrong, such as policies being ignored, rampant bullying etc. there should be something in place that can deal with it in a fair and open manner. I am very keen that the apparatus for dealing with problems should be in place before the problems arise (otherwise the trouble makers could specify and get control of the apparatus in a small community such as Wikibooks).

===Three important policies - act now===

Wikibooks is a pleasant and creative environment but I have peered into Wikipedia and feel strongly that we should prevent the sort of behaviour that occurs over there from happening here.  Just look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration requests for arbitration page], its the Wild West out there! I believe that three simple policies will stop this sort of thing from happening here: 

*If edit wars are immediately taken off-line onto a special administration page until resolved the heat of the situation would be dissipated immediately. No one would win by edit warring, the only way forward would be discussion and compromise. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Editing_disputes_policy Editing disputes policy] and add a comment.

*We should stop personal attacks at an early stage so that the situation will never arise where two contributors go to war or seriously offend each other. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:No_personal_attacks No personal attacks policy] and cast a vote. 

*Policies on their own are not enforceable without some form of apparatus. After the discussions above I would like to propose that any 3 administrators can form an ad hoc enforcement committee that can deal with any policy enforcement issue. See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Ad_hoc_administration_committee Ad hoc administration committee]

[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:55, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

::[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:No_personal_attacks No personal attacks policy] '''The vote seems to be overwhelmingly in favour of this policy being an enforced policy'''.


:This is in response to the entire section of SL, but breaking this comment across multiple subsections would put it in danger of not being seen. It does seem like a lot of the policy is &quot;borrowed&quot; from Wikipedia with the eventual intent to adopt the policies to WB, but this second part never went through. Rather than forming committees and boards and other stuff, the effort would be much more useful if it were directed into solidifying concrete policies on certain issues, which would solve 90% of the problems a board would otherwise have to discuss anyway.

:To address a number of other points in arbitrary order:
:#Rob Horning brings up some good points about the size and scope of Wikibooks currently - even with significant growth WB will still be a relatively small project and fairly self-managable. A committee at a Wikimedia-wide level to oversee disputes on several smaller projects would almost certainly be useful at this point, but I do see a downside in that such a board may not be familiar enough with the subtleties and &quot;culture&quot; of the individual projects, so the board should probably be made up of people from all of the projects (perhaps 2 or 3 from each project the board oversees).
:#The idea of WB currently being a collection of little &quot;projects&quot; is fairly fitting, but it's a model that works - users get comfortable working within a project they have knowledge in, and then once familiar with the software and policy, expand their scope to other areas. This being said, the most likely locations for edit-wars and POV disputes would be WITHIN these projects, and quite possibly resolvable also within that scope. The most POV things I've seen on WB in my short history here have all been on discussion pages like VFD and Staff Lounge - which is exactly what you'd expect to see there anyway.
:#This small project mentality could also work out to be beneficial in the future as the project grows - while site-wide contributors and moderators would not be able to keep track of and stay on a &quot;personal&quot; basis with all contributors, the mini-communities formed by people working on individual books or groups of books will serve to keep such an environment - which, as I've mentioned above, appears to be working well in &quot;growing&quot; useful contributors.
:#As the site grows, inevitably so will vandalism and bot attacks. As discussed below, blocking certain vandal-popular proxies will help, but you'll also get some &quot;bad apple&quot; registered users, and keeping on top of this may increase in difficulty as the project grows. Scaling the staff with the size of the project becomes important here. Right now I feel that a few areas of the site are being neglected, especially in policy discussion. There wasn't even any talk on [[Wikibooks talk:Stub|what defines a &quot;stub&quot;]] until I started a discussion during some cleanup efforts. (Starting to drift off-topic here, but I'll get to the main point soon.) Indeed, it seems that even the cleanup pages need cleanup, and IMO, there needs to be a '''policy drive''' of sorts to ''clearly define and update policy''. This would not only include some of the proposed or incomplete official policies, but also include developing concrete definitions for certain terms (such as the Stub policy mentioned above), solid procedures for common tasks (merging/moving modules), and generally bringing some outdated prominent pages in line with the direction WB is currently going. --[[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 09:51, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:::I agree with the idea of a policy drive because the current set of policies is still in draft format.  I also feel that the points that have been made about the small size of the Wikibooks community by Rob and others are valid - the Staff Lounge can deal with many issues. Perhaps we should collapse all the discussions here into another section on &quot;Policy development&quot;. See [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]]. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:15, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

::I would like to point out that there are some Wikimedia projects that seem to have a few overzealous administrators, especially when there is but one or two active admins on the project.  Perhaps there are good intentions, but administrators can run amok with little room for review.  This is especially difficult in situations that involve other cultural aspects like another language.  I've recently seen somebody complain about the Hebrew Wikipedia, which is BTW a language Jimbo doesn't read or speak, so he can't go into that project to try and resolve these issues directly.  i.e. Jimbo says.... doesn't apply really.  People who are used to the Wikipedia culture on en.wikipedia try out these smaller projects and discover some very different policies, perhaps even &quot;contrary&quot; to what they thought were standards for Wikimedia projects in general.  I would say that it is for these much smaller projects that the Wikimedia wide oversight committee ought to be in place, to perhaps give an avenue of appeal when the issue can't be resolved for whatever reason locally.  If we can get this put together to help us out, it would have a general benefit for many other projects as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:25, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:::The small scale of the project at present is leading to the question of whether enforcement should be applied through the Staff lounge or a committee. My own view is that some policies, such as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:No_personal_attacks No personal attacks policy] should be obvious and need not bother the staff lounge. If a personal attack occurs the person under attack should ask the perpetrator to desist. If this does not work then the person attacked should contact an admin who should warn that &quot;no personal attacks&quot; is an enforced policy and warn that the policy will be enforced. If this fails then the admin should contact two other admins and they should vote on whether to enforce ie: suspend the offending user. Personal attacks are easily avoided and just plain nasty, if a person refuses to desist they deserve this type of rapid response. 

:::It would be the same with [[Wikibooks:Editing_disputes policy]]. If there is a policy to take editing disputes on to a separate page that is not referenced in the book then it will be clear as daylight that the policy is being violated when someone reverts the actual book. Again, a no nonsense rapid response could occur and would be justified - why would someone revert the actual book if it were policy to take serious disputes to another page and they had been warned at least twice? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 16:38, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

=== Partial Protection Policy ===

This issue was brought up earlier, but I'm suggesting that perhaps some basic guidelines over partial edit protection might be useful.

I'm suggesting that in areas where voting occurs, such as on the VfD page or the various &quot;Book of the....&quot; voting pages, that they be protected from anonymous edits.  There is no need to have anonymous users (IMHO) to be able to edit this content, and they are more likely to mess things up than they are going to be able to fix them.  The VfD page is debateable, but often users are commenting when they don't understand Wikibooks policies.

This is just a thought, and perhaps even premature.  Still, any other comments would be appreciated if this might be a good idea.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:21, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

== Converting completed book to wikibook  ==

I have a completed book in MS Word. It has images and tables. It is about 230 pages. I am in the process of converting it into HTML so that chapters and page numbers are linked and each page has pagination with a chapter. When I complete the HTML version, '''how do I convert the entire book in HTML to a wikibook?''' I did find a few HTML to Wiki converters. But they convert only one page at a time and it would be a tedious job to do it that way. I am planning to publish the book through wiki publishing too. Any help is appreciated.

: I have used Word macros in the past - make a macro to put == or &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the beginning and end of a line, click on a heading and press the macro keys. You could also try saving as HTML in Word then doing global changes of H1, /H1 tags etc. to Wiki markup in &quot;view&quot;, &quot;HTML source&quot; then viewing the file and copying and pasting into Wikibooks. The Word document is an excellent starting position for using PDFCreator to make a PDF. [[User:81.98.73.236|81.98.73.236]] 22:36, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

MediaWiki grew from [[UseMod:UseModWiki|UseModWiki]], which has an ancestor at [[Wiki:WelcomeVisitors|very first WikiWikiWeb]].

I am told that recently, open proxies hit our sister project [[Wiktionary:Main Page|Wiktionary]] with large amounts of vandalism. [[User:Cspurrier|Cspurrier]] took the lead and started blocking a few proxies from the long list. Recently, after chatting with [[User:Tawker|Tawker]] in the #vandalism-en-wb [[WB:IRC|IRC channel]], I blocked some. (Unlike Cspurrier, I cannot block IPs on Wikinews or Meta.)

I want comments from Wikibookians concerning these three situations:
* The current procedure is to have a page containing [[Meta:WikiProject on open proxies/verified users|users who can verify proxies]] &amp;ndash; eventually to be maintained as a protected page by a Meta sysop. These &quot;verified users&quot; will put open proxies on the blacklist, but will not provide details (such as whether it was a HTTP proxy, SOCKS proxy, service such as http://anonymous.org, or [http://tor.eff.org Tor] exit node). ''Thus I wonder if there are any Wikibookians here who would prefer [[Wikibooks:administrators|administrators]] to not use this blacklist.''
* Some of you might want to allow Tor users to edit Wikibooks. (Tor defends against &quot;traffic analysis&quot;, so it is more useful than plain proxies that only hide your IP address, as anyone here can already create an account and hide their IP address.) I started trying Tor in April and have been able to edit both Wikibooks and Meta, but ''I plan to block Tor exit nodes if they appear on the blacklist.'' The reason for this is because Tor users have attacked [http://freenode.net Freenode IRC network], and have the potential to attack English Wikibooks. Unlike Freenode, we have no method of applying quick temporary bans to Tor users.
* Most of the proxies on the blacklist remain unblocked, because the list is too long. [[User:Tawker|Tawker]] is planning to obtain a bot that would block everything on the blacklist. ''I suggest that [[User:Tawker|Tawker]] have a sysop bot account for this purpose.'' This would require a vote on [[WB:RFA]]. It would technically give Tawker, who has few edits, access to sysop functions, but I trust Tawker not to misuse them: Tawker is already [[wikt:Special:Listusers/sysop|a sysop at en.wiktionary]] and is doing well in an [[w:WP:RFA#Tawker|open RFA on en.wikipedia]]. Further, Tawker provides the tawkbot3 to #vandalism-en-wb. We could instead arrange to have a Wikibooks sysop to operate the bot, but I think it would be easier to have Tawker operate it.

: I will support every effort aimed at blocking open proxies and networks like Tor. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:25, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

: I support this idea as well, and am even willing to make it &quot;official, enforced&quot; policy.  From what I understand, the IP blocks for editing don't stop you from creating a &quot;registered user&quot; account, so in theory you can still edit content with a blocked IP, just that you need to log in as a user.  It has been debated on Foundation-l and other forums that anon users could be blocked entirely, or have some additional restrictions put on them that would help slow down some vandalism, such as blocking new page creation for anon users.

:I have seen some positive contributions to Wikibooks by anon users, however, and I don't want to block them completely.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:25, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

No, that is not right. It should be documented better, but yes, '''IP blocks also block registered users at that IP'''. &lt;s&gt;The block is against the user, not the IP.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;(I meant to write that &quot;The block is against the IP, not the user.&quot; --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:17, 10 April 2006 (UTC))&lt;/small&gt; For example, meta.wikimedia.org blocks some, but not all, Tor exit nodes. If I, as [[m:User:Kernigh]], try to edit Meta from a blocked Tor exit node, then I am blocked. However, if I switch off Tor, or if Tor moves me to an unblocked Tor exit node, then I can immediately edit again. Thus these blocks ''will effect both anonymous and registered users''.

In contrast, when a blocked user reads the wiki, that IP becomes blocked. I tested this by creating and blocking a [[User:Kernigh sockpuppet]] for two hours. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:21, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:This is completely contrary to discussion that took place on Foundation-l, where there were some users who leveled some major complaints because they were being blocked due to their IP address falling onto dynamic IP addresses.  They were clearly trusted users... even administrators.  I think Anthere even got blocked once because of this (I need to check this to make sure).  The developers apologized and the concensus of the discussion threads were to permit registered users to log in even if the IP addresses themselves were blocked, just because of this issue.  If this has changed, this is a huge deal, and something that will even affect my own account.  I use dynamic IP addresses myself right now from a public ISP, and potentially a vandal could be blocked and I subsequently get that IP address.  Either that or something that needs to be brought up again on Bugzilla as something to fix.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:56, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

Here is a link to '''[[Bugzilla:550]]''', and to [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.wikimedia.foundation/2272/focus=2272 a foundation-l thread that mentions it]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 04:40, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

==[[Developing A Universal Religion]]==

I think this book should be transwiki'ed to wikisource (I shan't explain why here, as I'd like to let you make your own mind up). However, before doing this, I'd welcome comments for others, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:32, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

: This book was donated to Wikibooks by its author, [[User:David Hockey]], with the intention that other users would edit it. The problem with putting this on Wikisource is the rule, [[s:Wikisource:What is Wikisource?|Wikisource:What is Wikisource?]], against material written by contributors to Wikisource. However, a proposed policy, [[s:Wikisource:What Wikisource includes|Wikisource:What Wikisource includes]] might allow that in certain cases, but it still prohibits contributions where later content edits (not formatting edits are expected).

: In the [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Developing_A_Universal_Religion|archived RFD]], David H wrote, ''I sent the book to Wikibooks because I thought that it contained enough facts to be useful to those searching religions, and maybe interesting to those trying to understand why we have religions. (I am also sure that the book could be improved by edits!)'' Thus I believe that this book is outside the scope of the Wikisource project, and should not be transwikied to Wikisource. Still, the VFD did not yield consensus (and was distracted by allegations that there was a copyright violation), so there ''might'' be reasons to not have this book (and the three related books) at Wikibooks.

: Jguk has recently done a lot of work to remove out-of-scope material from Wikibooks, and I hope that this user continues to identify things that need to be moved elsewhere. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:13, 9 April 2006 (UTC) (also [[s:User:Kernigh]])

:Keep in mind that self-contributions to Wikisource are not permitted... of course this wouldn't necessrily be a self-contribution, would it?  In this situation, you ought to get some Wikisource individuals to agree to help take it if it comes their way.  BTW, this book was the [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Developing A Universal Religion|subject of a RFD]] that ended inconclusively, although there were both delete and keep votes and some valid points for both points of view.  This is a philosophy book, and the author is willing to let Wikibooks contributors help to change the content/merge/reorganize to improve what is here.

:One other problem to keep in mind is that this ''book'' is actually broken up into several titles.  I personally think they should be merged together into one single &quot;volume&quot;, but that doesn't require a full RFD.  See [[Thinking And Moral Problems]], [[Religions And Their Source]], and [[Purpose]] that really all go together with [[Developing A Universal Religion]].  There was a purpose for them being seperate volumes.

:This book does bring up the issue about what to do with substantial contributions of material that is added to Wikibooks.  Generally we try to generate content on the fly, and books that have &quot;grown up&quot; on Wikibooks are not considered for being transwikied to another projects with just a few exceptions.  Content consisting of dozens or hundreds of pages that was already created and edited elsewhere before its inclusion into Wikibooks is obviously going to present some challenges.  Should contributions this large be allowed on Wikibooks at all?  Why or why not?  

:I think substantial contributions can be added to Wikibooks, provided GFDL licensing clearance is obtained, maintains NPOV guidelines, and the author is willing to let Wikibooks users have at it and rework the content to perhaps unrecognizable from the original material or even a very different (hopefully NPOV) viewpoint.  Perhaps some guidelines on what major contributions like this can be added to Wikibooks should be made, and what an author using Wikibooks for publication of textbook-like material should be informed of for large contributions.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:44, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:I had the impression that Wikisource was intended for copies of material that existed with exactly the same content outside the Wiki (except for translations, source code, statistics and similar data) and that the point was to provide an easily accessible copy for reference purposes.  [[Developing A Universal Religion]] no longer falls into that category because it has already been edited on Wikibooks so the hardcopy version that was or is available as a printed work is out of sync with the Wikibooks version.  If this isn't what Wikisource is for then how does it differ from Wikibooks?  Here is a quote from Wikisource: &quot;New collaborative creations of fiction or non-fiction (&quot;self-contributions&quot;) do not belong at Wikisource. This project is primarily for previously published works that have normally undergone some sort of peer-review, ...&quot; (http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:What_Wikisource_includes#Original_contributions).  The proposal to transwiki [[Developing A Universal Religion]] seems to me to be one step toward proposing that any book that counts as complete should be transwikied there so that Wikibooks only contains work in progress.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 12:28, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

== CheckUser vote dead ==

After taking a look at [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]] I came into opinion that we really need users with CheckUsers rights. There are regular cases of registered vandals. Unfortunately, voting at [[WB:RFA#Requests_for_CheckUser_rights|RFA]] has been inactive for a long time and we still lack about 10 votes to finish it. I ask all users who haven't seen it to take a look at explanations provided there and think about adding their vote. Please remember that only if both candidates get support the vote ends with acceptation. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 10:44, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:It is notable that some stewards are suggesting that you don't need the total number of affirmative votes if you have a smaller project.  The minimum number of votes was for larger projects to put some sort of threshold on who could get the &quot;privilege&quot; of doing a check user scan.

:From my viewpoint, I think this is over-paranoia at what should have been from the start a power given either directly to bureaucrats or admins.  Either administrators are trusted users and therefore should be able to be trusted with this apparently sensitive information, or they are not and the whole concept of administrators is dead in the water, with all admins being desysoped effectively.

:And what is really revealed if you do a checkuser scan of an account?  You get the IP address.  Big deal!  Really, I think this much ado over nothing.  If you were worried about government action against you, they can get your IP address without the assistance of the Wikimedia Foundation if necessary.  And your IP address is logged in on every website that you visit, including google, amazon.com, or anything else that you use on the internet.  It is not like this is a national ID number that can be used to mess over your credit rating or get you enlisted in the military service of some country.

:The whole point about having this is to deal with the occasional sock puppet problems when doing a vote, and to perhaps take additional measures against vandals who seem to do persistant damage.  In both of these cases, you have a powerful tool to help combat this sort of damage but it is being denied from those who really need to use it.  And the contrary issue of abuse is comparatively insignificant.  

:The worst abuse I can see happening with this is outright publication of IP addresses of all users on the project where somebody has checkuser privileges, with a trace or reverse DNS to reveal exactly what ISP you are using and perhaps where you made the edit from.  It still reveals absolutely no personal information of any sort at all that can be traced to an individual without many additional records, most of which you would have to go through government procedures like getting a supenoa or search warrent to obtain that information.  Again, if you are paranoid about the government knowing what you are doing on-line, you simply shouldn't be using a private connection from your home or someplace that links the computer usage directly to you.  Disclosing or not disclosing this information is not going to make a bit of difference.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:02, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

:I need to add that I have made a [[meta:Requests for permissions#English Wikibooks|formal request on meta]] for having a Steward to make a pronoucement over this issue.  I admit that this is forcing the hands of the Stewards to make a political statement, as clearly the attitude seems to be right now that only Wikipedia can have anybody with Check User rights.  This is really silly, and IMHO is something that needs to change.  The problem is, how do you make the policy change?  There is no procedure to even bring up a policy change for things like this, and the stewards don't seem to give any respect to local policy procedures regarding Check User right granting.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:49, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

== Speedy deletion of Stubs ==

This is an issue that has to be decided soon, or there will be no stubs to discuss.  [[User:Jguk]] is deleting a whole bunch of Wikibooks that are stubs.  Perhaps this is a good idea, but this is not a part of [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy#Speedy deletions]] and I'm raising a stink right now to complain about this.  Far too much has been deleted lately and IMHO if this keeps up we might as well just nuke the whole project like has happened to the French Wikiquote.  OK, I'm pissed, and I've warned this user on his talk page.

Deletion is something that is reserved for trusted users, and I would agree with many of the decisions that Jguk has been making are pretty good, especially the recent addition to this policy of deleting &quot;A redirect where it is unlikely that anyone will inadventently search for a page under that name.&quot;  I think a few too many of these have even been deleted, but those are easy to restore if you think they really do belong.  BTW, this policy was added to the deletion policy without vote or really any conclusive discussion, and huge amounts of content on Wikibooks has been deleted due to this &quot;new&quot; policy.  For so much activity based on a self-written policy, that is quite dangerous.

As far as deleting &quot;permanent stubs&quot;, I refer to [[Wikibooks talk:Stub#Stub Deletion Policy]] of which there are only two comments at all about the idea.  This should not be the basis for a policy change here on Wikibooks.  There are some postive things that can come from having stubs... even ones that are seemingly hopeless to languish forever.  See [[Wikibooks:Stub]] for the current philosophy (not policy) on the subject.  The '''policy''' is to keep them here on Wikibooks, and edit them if you don't like it.  Very trivial stubs that are just a few sentances may be deleted, but still assume good faith where possible.

I think it is reasonable to have a debate over what to do about larger stubs that still don't seem to show any progress to becoming a substantial Wikibook.  If you think these need to be deleted at the moment, nominate them for a VfD where they can be decided individually.  Perhaps a change of policy can be enacted to clean out some of the additional cruft that has been building up over the past few years, but that should be done through community concensus, not just the actions of a single user and his own opinion.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:55, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:Under no circumstance should a stub be put up for a speedy deletion.  A VFD, if there is very little to build off of and no activity, is perfectly fine.  But making them speedy is a mistake.  Bringing up a VFD publicizes these books.  Quite frequently, the end result is not a deletion but 3 or 4 people see the VFD and take over the book.  I've put several stubs up for VFD, and later reversed my decision as people started contributing to it again due to the new publicity.  I think this is a far better method-  give those books a last chance.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 16:35, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

I do take deletion seriously, and consider carefully what merits there are in retaining the text versus the benefits of tidying WB up that little bit more - and I do consider using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag, and VfD where I am not sure. On occasions, no doubt others may come to different conclusions, but that's no problem - it's all logged and I'm happy to restore articles on request and move them to VfD if I am not persuaded they will grow.

Many of the permastubs I have removed are mere outlines of books put together by users who only edited the site on one day many months, or in many cases, years ago. Often these are about arcane issues, and quite frankly (1) they will never be books; (2) in the (unlikely) circumstance that someone now wanted to develop a book on that subject, the value in starting from what was already there is negligible. To my mind, for these entries, there is negligible chance of them avoiding VfD. However, if I find more, let me assure you I will add them to VfD - it may mean that VfD gets much larger, but it will allow for more discussion.

There are many orphaned incomplete one-pagers that I have deliberately left for now - including all those that could be developed into sections for a general &quot;how-to&quot; book, as well as those that have subject areas similar to existing books and may (although more likely may not) prove to be worth merging. The larger permastubs (except those unambiguously falling outside WB's remit - eg should be on and already on wikisource), I have left untouched.

Looking at the broader picture - I think it is important that Wikibooks encourages complete books rather than short stubs. It takes a lot of work to complete a book, and most people are not willing to put in that level of effort - there are many &quot;false starts&quot;. Some of the larger stubs can, I believe, usefully be grouped together to give a coherent book - the Cookbook is one example of this, Bartending (once fully tidied up) will be another such example. The &quot;How-to&quot; bookshelf could, and should, be transferred in format so that it is a coherent Book in its own right, to which little pieces of information can easily be added. Many of the stubs do share certain themes, and grouping them thematically into several wholes will be beneficial - it will also set a good example to other (future) editors. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:12, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

== Hit Counting ==

I slipped a hit counter into the &quot;consciousness studies&quot; book. The counter file html provided a redirect back to Wikibooks. It used computing power on an ISP's computer, not the Wikibooks servers. The results were 20 hits a day to the first embedded page of the book (not the main page) and 16 hits a day to the PDF versions (apart from the PDF accessible from the Wikibooks main page). This means that a fairly esoteric and academic book such as Consciousness Studies was probably accessed in earnest by at least 50 people a day, possibly more if there were numerous accesses from the front page. This result is very encouraging (hardcopy sales of 18000 academic textbooks on consciousness studies per annum would be amazing, perhaps impossible).

Is it possible to place the Wikimedia hit counters on selected pages for sample periods so that people can tell which books are popular and so that administrators can tell which paths are most popular? It would encourage people to write Wikibooks if they knew they were likely to be widely read. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:32, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:I second that.  It's dispiriting to spend ages writing and then get no feedback at all.  Speaking for myself this is the principal reason for my lack of edits in the last couple of months.  perhaps you could give a rcipe for those of us who have never added hit counters to a web page.  How much bandwidth is consumed by a hit counter?  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 08:59, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

::What I did was to link to my own HTML file: [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/countit.htm Countit.htm]. If you open the file then &quot;View&quot;/&quot;Source&quot; in Internet Explorer you will see that it has a trivial Javascript at the start with a redirect, an &quot;Onclick=&quot; on the BODY that activates the redirect if people click on the page and a counter at the bottom. The hit counter runs on my own ISP's servers, not Wikibook's servers, it does not burden Wikibooks at all. The link to the file is put in place of a link to one of the book's opening pages or as a substitute for the &lt;nowicki&gt;[[media:consciousness_studies.pdf]]&lt;/nowicki&gt; statement. If you were doing this you would need to copy countit.htm to your own computer, delete the SymError() and SymOnUnload() scripts, amend it for your chosen redirect, insert the code for your own ISP's counter and then upload it to your personal web space. If your ISP does not provide a hit counter (most do) you can search google for freebies (just search for &quot;hit counter&quot;). The link that you add to wikibooks would be to www.YOUR URL/countit.htm - this diverts the user out to your ISP for counting and then, with a click, diverts them back to read the wikibooks page.

::Ideally we should have access to a single media wiki counter per book within Wikibooks, run on the Wikibooks servers, that is allowed to run for 1 week only on a given page. This would allow sampling without all the faffing about described above and would not overburden the Wiki servers. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:18, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

:: Yes, having some hitcounters would be nice. At [[Ada Programming]] we monitor your success by looking at the [http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=124904&amp;ugn=wikibook-ada download statistic] for the demo programms attached to our book. Currently we are at a steady 30 to 40 downloads a month - which is pretty good as it shows the amount of readers interested enought to actualy download the demos. Still it would be nice to know how many readers download the pdf or read the different pages. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:41, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:You really have to be careful when you just look at hit numbers with a counter. If you actually look at what hosts are viewing the pages, often times you will see that a majority are bots of some sort like Googlebot and MSNbot. 16-20 hits a day to me says it's more random automated traffic and less determined users. A true stats package (not sure how it would work with a simple page inclusion but many are available to analyze Apache logs which I bet is unfortunately unavailable here) to analyze who is viewing a page would be more appropriate in my opinion since you can get much more information. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 13:16, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:: Does anyone know who is responsible for the reinstatement of hit counters? We could control for Bots by having some sort of hidden link on the main page (a link that is part of some innocuous text at the bottom of the page). The bots would follow this link but people would not, so the hit count on this could be subtracted from any other hit count to give true views. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 17:20, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:Why do we need hit counters?  Why not just sample the server logs?  The sampling interval could be chosen to reduce the cpu load to an arbitrarily low value at the expense of timeliness.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 20:50, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

::Do you know how to do that? I have had a look around the stats pages and cannot figure out whether the current dumps are XML or SQL, cannot find any documentation of field names and cannot find any sample code from previous attempts at doing this. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:25, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

:::With the current fiasco that is going on right now with even trying to get somebody with checkuser rights on en.wikibooks, I seriously doubt that anybody here is going to get access to the server logs.  That would require developer access, a formal proposal to the Wikimedia Foundation board directly, and some kind of escrow or some other means to strongly demonstrate that you are not going to abuse access to the information.  In short, while technically possible as a practical matter it is impossible.  The current database dumps are only edit logs, and not access logs.  And that information is already available anyway from the history tab on all of the pages, so the db dump would only be useful for large-scale scanning... again to keep bandwith hogging down.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:06, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

::::Which brings us back to using Wiki hit counters on a sample basis only (ie: put them on certain pages for a week then remove them). [http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Main_Page Orthodox wiki] is the first wiki that I found on a google search with the counters still in place. Does anyone know how to do this? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:05, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

::::As [[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] says analysing the Apache logs is the best way.  I presume that the fear is that the IP addresses of the readers could be used to compromise them somehow.  Couldn't we sidestep both the abuse question and the developer access a little by partitioning the problem: ask the developers to provide a filtered Apache log that doesn't include sensitive information; then anyone could analyse the log.  The sensitive information is, presumably, the IP address and referer.  The [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#accesslog Apache Common Log Format] puts the client IP address as the first item on the line and doesn't include the referer.  The first thing to do would be to replace all the IP addresses that belong to well known spiders by, say, 'spider' and all the remaining ones by, say, 'human'.  To hinder timing analysis the hours and minutes of the time stamp could also be removed.  Then the log can be published and whoever wants to can analyse it.   Otherwise I suppose we need a bot to walk the modules adding and removing hit counter links.  For a given degree of quality of statistics this would surely be a greater cpu and bandwidth load than log analysis.   --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 19:25, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

:::::The important thing is to get the data so that Wikibooks can be customised according to popular access paths and authors can get some feedback. The Apache logs are an excellent idea. If we can't get the logs then hit counters would be a backup position. 

:::::I suggest that, in the first instance, we ask for weekly logs without IP addresses or times. This request cannot be contentious and involves very little development work at the server end. It will give us the same data as would be provided by simple hit counters so we would need to be wary when interpreting it. Having got these we should ask for more complex data. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

::::::I'd like to point out that it would still require somebody with very high trust even among developers to put in the software for this sort of request.  This is, however, something that would be of interest to people even outside of just our little project here, so creating a formal proposal on the [[m:|Wikimedia Meta Wiki]] would be a good idea, as would creating a [[bugzilla:|Bugzilla]] request for the developers that gets into some specific details about what sorts of information would be useful.  The only way this is going to get accomplished with any speed, however, is to get directly involved with trying to code something like this.  Still, even bringing the issue up might get the interest of additional projects and other people with technical skills.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

I contacted one of the developers on this issue, unfortunately they do not maintain access logs - see: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Brion_VIBBER#Dump_of_Apache_Access_Log - he replied:

:&quot;We do not keep such logs at this time; our traffic level and proxy setup makes it prohibitive. --[[User:Brion VIBBER|brion]] 22:27, 18 April 2006 (UTC)&quot;  
So, it seems that hit counters/hit sampling is the only possibility. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:45, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

==Policy Review==

[[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] has numerous policies that have not been cleared or implemented.  Another user ([[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]]) has proposed that these policies should be reviewed.

The most important omission is [[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]] which begins: '''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''. I would suggest that [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] is put in place to plug the gap temporarily (even though the staff lounge is used for this purpose at present).

The next policy that needs immediate attention is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]], this has received a majority of votes to be taken as an enforced policy but has not been moved to enforced status.

The [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]] would probably stop edit wars and forestall most trouble and might be moved to a vote ASAP.

The list below summarises all the outstanding policies:
* [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] - How to delete pages
* [[Wikibooks:Editing policy]] - How to edit pages
* [[Wikibooks:Image use policy]] - How to use images
* [[Wikibooks:No legal threats]]
* [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]
* [[Wikibooks:Protected page]] - About protected pages

: I think we should reorganise [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] to make it more readable and start using navigational templates like the one in [[w:WP:NPOV]]. I think we should have several templates like this: one for policies/guidelines, second for book maintenance (vfd, copyvio, textbook planning), third for administration tasks ([[WB:VIP]], [[WB:RFA]]). I think it's neccessary to allow new users to browse easily through our meta pages. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:52, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

::It would be useful to have some pruning first. The Dispute Resolution, Editing disputes policy, No legal threats, No personal attacks, No offensive usernames and Ad hoc administration committee proposal pages could all usefully be  replaced by a single, short &quot;Be Nice&quot; proposed policy, which could then be adopted, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:46, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

:One thing to keep in mind is that we really do need a central place to hold these policy change votes.  There is a place that has some of these votes, which is [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote]].  Unfortunately, this page isn't being used nearly enough, and we need to start plugging through the rest of the policies like the no personal attacks policy and make sure it is linked to this main voting page somehow.  I guess this is a policy question about how to make policies.

:I hold the opinion that any Wikibooks user should be able to propose any policy change, and there should be a common place to let the Wikibooks community know that this policy change is being debated and voted on for approval. Far too many of these policy change votes have been taking place on individual policy talk pages, and even somebody as active as I am has missed many of these votes simply because I havn't been able to find even what page they are located at.  A significant policy change such as [[WB:NP]] (this did get quite a bit of input, so I'm using this only as an example) should be widely advertised here, as well as perhaps even on the main page itself.  When you make a policy change like [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks/Archive 1#Wikibooks is not a dictionary|the no dictionary policy]], it shouldn't be decided by just a very few users by default because there is no apparent oppostion.  Voting standards (the 20 edit minimum, for example) and details over what is being changed should be quite clear.  There should also be a clear time limit on the voting, so everybody knows when it will be official, or when the issue will drop dead.  There is no point for considering votes that are months old, or if a policy with little support suddenly gets a bunch of users who hurry up, vote to support (or reject) the policy, and then move to say &quot;see, this is the result of the vote!&quot;  The time limit on voting also gives a neutral end to the voting process, so you can declare a winner or that the policy has been rejected.  The '''No Personal Attack Policy''' vote lacks this feature, so it is still in &quot;limbo&quot; even though it is clear that this is an acceptable policy to most Wikibooks users.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:19, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

===Elevating [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] to enforced status===

[[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] has had an overwhelming majority vote to become enforced. I would like to propose that it is moved to &quot;enforced&quot; status. (This is partly a response to Rob's comment above. I will put an &quot;enforced&quot; tag on the policy (depending on objections to this action here of course). [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:44, 12 April 2006 (UTC)
:The vote for the policy to be enforced was 4:1 and involved 10 users - a lot by Wikibooks standards - so I have tagged the policy as &quot;enforced&quot;. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:22, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

==Suggestion to Create Standardized Book Info Templates==
I read the related section of [[Wikibooks:Bookshelves/Generation_2#Centralised_development_stages|Wikibooks:Bookshelves/Generation_2]] and thought that we should expand on it. I'm suggesting to create templates not related to the academic content of each book. These templates would be stored as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book Name/Infobox}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, simply &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book Name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, or perhaps on their own namespace. The main advantage is that information could easily be added to a variety of places, especially those not thought of or in use yet.

Usage examples and advantages:
*Cover page of a book - See [[Finance]] and [[Final Cut Pro]]. Wikibooks has often been criticized for not having unity between its books and this is an undisruptive way of adding that unity. Wikibooks from the same bookshelf, for example, can all have the same color scheme on the cover page bar, similar to related Wikipedia articles using the same infoboxes, and could all be automatically added to the same category.
*Lists, specifically [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical Classification]] and the bookshelves. - See the two examples on [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical_Classification#F]]. Only having a book's name in the left 10% doesn't really help a user to pick out a good book quickly. Using templates would allow the books on a bookshelf listing to have a parameter added to or removed from the list en masse.

Sample Parameters: 
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Book Infobox|Finance|25%|shelf=Business
|dept=Social Science
|image=...
|category=...
|chapters=...
|prerequisites=...
|authors=...
|alphabetical=F
|reading level=13+
|last update=April 10, 2006
|(short) comment=stub
|notes=Equivalent to an introductory college course.}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

could produce
*Infobox - standard template message
*Cover page bar - on the main page of a book
*Extended list entry - currently set for all Wikibooks namespace pages but can be limited to specific pages
*Compact list entry - the same as the page name + {{tl|stage}} listing currently in use, not currently set for anything

All parameters other than book name are optional, so templates can easily be created by bots or a simple &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book Infobox|Finance|25%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; by a new user. See {{bad link|Template:Finance/Infobox}} and {{bad link|Template:Final Cut Pro/Infobox}} for more examples. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 22:01, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

:I think this is an excellent idea, and I like how it is turning out.  The only issue that IMHO needs to be resolved is the bookshelf organization, which I would like to see dealt with before we make a huge inroad into adding this template all over Wikibooks... especially in the book search pages.  Dispite an initial burst of discussion, there hasn't been any additional work or alternate proposals for reworking the bookshelves.  Barring none, I might just go in and '''be bold''' to make the changes.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:30, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

::Thanks for the support. Just to clarify, what I'm proposing here is the creation of book records templates. Adding it to search pages is just one example of its potential usefulness, and should be discussed later. If a bot creates templates for all books from all lists and bookshelves, simply adding &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Alphabetical Classification|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to {{tl|Book Infobox}} would make forming an alphabetical listing by hand needless, so I think that this (whether standardized templates are a good idea) should be decided sooner rather than later (and their implementation later). Also a comment on bookshelf reorganization - I think it would be a good idea to first organize books into the categories within each bookshelf. Then we would only be taking into consideration the number of categories when creating bookshelves, rather than the total number of books. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 16:56, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

:::A problem here to keep in mind is that there are many new bookshelves, and some that are defacto bookshelves that were created by various contributors.  I've moved most of these to the ''Wikibooks:'' namespace, but there are some others still out there, including [[Computer programming]], which is really a bookshelf with some added material, and not a book per se.  I agree that organizing books into categories would be a good idea, but there are some books listed on these alternate bookshelves that are not listed anywhere else.  Knowing where to merge these bookshelves, such as [[Wikibooks:Biology bookshelf]] is one of the questions that is up for debate.  Some bookshelves have really grown substantially and are in the same shape that the information technology bookshelf was about a year ago.  I am now estimating that there are close to 1000 Wikibooks (my original estimate was about 700), and my current count is over 850 on the alphabetical page alone, and many of those aren't even on a bookshelf yet of any kind.  I would hate to see a major effort go into classifying books into various bookshelves when in fact the whole organization is going to be thrown out, just in time to reclassify everything all over again.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:28, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

::::One way to bypass classification problems is to record the most detailed level a book could be at on the info template. So biology books would be templated as &quot;Classification=Biology,&quot; then we would be able to change that on all biology books to &quot;Bookshelf=Natural science&quot; using {{tl|Book Infobox}} if that's the shelf we decide to use. I would like to know whether it would be possible to add books from all pages books are stored at to a list and have a bot create the info templates with only the book name. If that's done, an alphabetical listing category would be generated automatically, saving a lot of work. (Note that I used category to mean &quot;subsection of a bookshelf&quot; above, different from my below proposal.) --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 20:25, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

== Auto Generation of Classification Tables ==

I've been thinking a little bit about this, and it would be nice to automate the generation of some of these tables.  This really is a database problem, where some ability to search Wikibooks on multiple criteria needs to occur.  It is making me very tempted to try to brush up on php and try to join the MediaWiki developer team to at least add a plug-in to help us out with this task.  I could try and write a 'bot to help deal with this issue, but this is something that really should be a permanent feature on Wikibooks and not something I or any one person can do and have everybody else plead that I update such and such table with some new information.

The [[Meta:Wikidata|Wikidata]] proposal on Meta is something that would be ideal.  Perhaps a temporary solution needs to be implemented before the flexible database is added to Wikibooks?  There are other options including the [[Meta:Toolserver|tools server]] that is hosted by the [[Meta:Wikimedia Deutschland|Wikimedia Deutschland chapter]].  This has access to the full Wikimedia database, including all of the Wikibooks pages, with all of the edits as well.  I'm sure that there is a group of technically inclined people here on Wikibooks that could get together and help put something like this together that would help the project as a whole.

Goals I would want to have with auto-generated pages (including perhaps an improved {{bad link|Wikibooks:Top active}}???):

*Content on that page should be updatable by any Wikibooks user.  Perhaps restricted to only registered users or some other restriction if it chews up server CPU time, but any trusted user should be allowed access, and it should be &quot;no big deal&quot; to request access.  This implies that any user could access the updated data.  See [[Meta:List of Wikibooks]] for an example of an updatable page that ordinary Wikimedia users can update easily.  I was thinking something like this for other dynamic pages as well.
*The source code should be available to trusted users to modify the way it works.  Unlike the List of Wikibooks, this should not be on a private server that only one user has access to.  Users and people come and go over time, and if things just aren't working out but need an overhaul, it should be available for a whole new group to go in and potentially rewrite the whole thing if necessary.  Hosting on a Wikimedia-affiliated website would be a major plus, hence the request to use the tool server as a significant option.

If there is any interest in this at all, even just moral support, but other software developers who are interested in doing this, please make your mark below.  I'm also starting up a page with [[Wikibooks:Content Tools]] to help with the coordination of various projects that can be done to help with the development of Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:24, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

:{{bad link|Wikibooks:Top active}} is not as interesting as a &quot;Top Accessed&quot; page. This would allow Wikibooks to market the most popular books most prominently and so draw in readers. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 17:33, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

::I would like to point out that the reason why the internal hit counters were disabled on the Wikimedia servers was because of the CPU processing time alone.  By turning off the hit counters, the developers were able to get something like a 30%-50% increase in page throughput to end users (I really think it was this big).  Of course page demand quickly ate up all of the available bandwidth, so turning the hit counters has not been a priority for quite some time.  The solution of using a 3rd party server is an idea, and that is something very interesting to try out.  It certainly would be interesting to see how our own generated stats compare to the stats being claimed by Alexa.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:08, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, that's a much better solution! I always thought we were limited by the MediaWiki software, and tried to think of ways to work around it. But integration into the software is clearly the better course. Best of luck in creating it. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 21:01, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

==Replacing Shelves with Portals and Categories==
I decided to add this here because it relates to the above proposal.

; Categories

At the present, I can't see how bookshelves are any different from [[:Category:Categories|categories]]. I also think using categories can provide easier access to a book, because they allow for several autmomatic classification methods.

An example with [[:Category:Computer programming|Category:Programming]]:

*Category:Programming languages (all) (sorted by subsection)
*Category:Programming languages (all) (sorted alphabetically)
*Category:Programming languages (list of subcategories)
*Category:Programming languages (sorted by completeness)
**Category:Programming languages (completed books)
**Category:Programming languages (75% complete books), etc
*Category:Programming languages (sorted by difficulty)

Also having general categories (All books =&gt; Sorted alphabetically, sorted by completeness, etc). Books could be added autmoatically to all of these categories by adding &quot;Classification=[type of programming language]&quot; to the book's info template (proposed above).

;Portals
All shelves are unique and shouldn't all have their contents displayed in the same fashion. So I propose the creation of individual portals by those familliar with the books on a certain shelf. The portal would also act as its own Wikiproject - listing stubs, collaborating between books, and creating book standards. This would be useful because experts in a specific field have general knowledge of related books, and many basic books are missing or incomplete.

Possible functions and sections:

*featured book
*list of popular books
*related wikiversity schools section (w/ links, classes currently enrolling, and news)
*portal collaboration of the month section
*which books are for who, books for beginners on the subject section
*stubs for popular or general subjects section
*news on book developments and changes section
*to-do list / maintenance tasks for books section
*list of book series section
*list of subsections (linking to the categories) section
*list of sort types for all related books (linking to categories) section
*links to related vfd discussions and proposed merges section
*collaboration between similar books (examples: [[World History/Causes and course of the First World War|1]], [[Modern History/First World War|2]], [[European History/Europe: 1918 to 1945|3]])
--[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 20:25, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

: Programming languages are not a good example, because they are overrepresented. This is a very specific category of books being specially popular here on Wikibooks. Other bookshelves are more general and it's not easy to link all of them. Take [[Subject:Science|Science bookshelf]] - there is physics together with neuroscience. I don't think there is much sense in sorting Physics books in lots of different categories, because there is too few of them.

: Also, categories can only show title of book. With bookshelves, you can provide a brief description of a book, show its stage development and for example availability of print version.

: When it comes to portals - there's a similar situation, Wikibooks don't have much active contributors and I fear most of such portals would be dead. If Book of The Month wins with less than 10 votes, how can we maintain: to-do lists, current lists of stubs, current VFD's and so on? I think it's completely unreal in present state of Wikibooks. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:12, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

::Of course Physics shouldn't have its own category! But science should. The science category would be divided into subcategories offering books sorted by type (physical, biological, etc), completion, etc, just like programming. Physics books would be sorted into a lot of &quot;Science&quot; categories, not its own set of categories. I'm talking about applying this only {{tl|Bookshelves}} deep. The beauty is that you wouldn't have to manually sort books. If the info template of a Science books says &quot;status=75%&quot; and type=&quot;science&quot;, it automatically goes into all those categories. That's not possible with bookshelves. I agree that only showing the title of a book can be a problem. but in the case of print versions, there's already a category for that, and its relatively empty. As for portals, I think it's reasonable to assume that at least one person on a shelf of dozens of books is willing to create a portal. Other than collaborations, which wouldn't be done on the portal page, I don't think the portal page would have more upkeep required than could easily be done . --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 21:37, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

:The thing is that bookshelves are portals!  I think this is mixing terminology with function.  There is no reason to have each bookshelf be so rigid as it is just a carbon copy of the next one, and indeed each bookshelf does have a little bit of unique flavor to it... especially if it is a bit older and has had some different people working on it.  The only reason why the bookshelves look similar right now is because they have all been maintained by essentially the same group of people.

:The problem I have with the categories is that they are so rigid in terms of what content is displayed that you can't add things like the Wikibooks stages icons, links to PDF files, &quot;main discussion page&quot;, or a list of all sub-modules.  The category setup works very well for Commons and Wikipedia, and it was built with those projects in mind.  For Wikibooks, I would almost ask to have the whole category system shut off completely.  There certainly is no need to categorize each and every page in Wikibooks, and [[Special:Uncategorizedpages]] is particularly useless here on Wikibooks.  [[Special:Wantedpages]] is a close second most useless page on Wikibooks, and [[Special:allpages]] being a very close 3rd.  [[Special:prefixindex]], on the other hand, is more valuable on Wikibooks than it is on Wikipedia.  BTW, [[WB:NP]] has actually helped improve the allpages, but most of that is currently garbage and improvement is relative.  It isn't too hard to go from awful to nearly awful.

:Another drawback to categories is that it is very difficult to tell if a subcategory is empty, or links to a hive of 1 million different modules/articles.  Perhaps I would like to look at all of the books in the Computer Department, for example.  Unless you do the incredibly redundant multiple linking in both the parent and child categories, you can't pull this list out.  And some pages are linked on the parent category but no the child category and vice versa, with no tools to reasonably search for inconsistancies here either.

:The one advantage that categories have over just about any other MediaWiki feature at the moment is that you can add the category links from ''within'' each book as it is created.  This gives some flexability to content developers, and lets ''the authors'' create the category references, for where they want to catalog the content.  It is also harder to vandalize categories without a bot, although that is a two-edged sword in the sense that if you want to reorganize a category (pushing content into subcats), you need to edit each and every module that needs to be moved.  I've done that on Commons, but it is a pain.

:I think there is a role for categories, however, and it is a powerful tool if we can really get a handle on how to use it properly.  Some books, like the [[Cookbook]], have really taken advantage of the category system and used it to its full potential.  There are some Wikibooks like [[RuneScape]] that IMHO could try to do the same thing for some of its content.  Its role within Wikibooks for the project as a whole with a single hive of links is somewhat more questionable.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:55, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

::Yes, I agree that the ''current'' categories system is useless. I want to create a main &quot;bookshelves&quot;/&quot;all Wikibooks sorted by type/genre&quot; category, with the subcategories being those now found in {{tl|Bookshelves}}. The subcategories of those would only be the various sorting methods. My proposal is highly dependent on whether Wikibooks decides to use records templates for books. If the records tempalte states &quot;classification=physics&quot; and &quot;status=100%&quot; {{tl|Book Infobox}} would automatically include the book in the &quot;Science/type|Physics,&quot; &quot;Science/alphabetical,&quot; and &quot;Science/completed,&quot; subcategories of a main &quot;science&quot; category. If, whenever Science gets too large and a new Physics shelf (portal+category) is created, you would only need to change {{tl|Book Infobox}} to categorize Physics book on their own. Many other ways to sort books, such as the last updated date, would also be possible. 

::I guess I want the portals to act as the short templates at the top of bookshelves, and the categories as the book lists. There are very few high quality books on Wikibooks. I would guess less than ten. So I think the best way to highlight those books while still giving attention to important stubs and encouraging development of those stubs is with portals. Am I wrong in believing that the bookshelves don't perform that function? Portals would also be future-proof: if the number and quality of subsections (physics books, for example) increases to those of the general sections (such as all the science books right now), they can be split off into their own portals, highlighting the best physics book and encouraging development of important stubs. But I'm not going to push the issue. You two know a lot more than I do on what's best for Wikibooks, and I just wanted to throw my ideas out on the table. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 20:55, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== Interactive Self-test Template ==

I made a template called &quot;Peekaboo&quot; to provide a degree of interactive, self-test abilility to Wikibooks. A question is placed in the first box, then by clicking on the [&lt;u&gt;Show&lt;/u&gt;] button to the right, users can reveal the answers in the second box without leaving the page. Everything prints out as currently displayed on-screen. Hopefully this will be useful to a few of you and help some Wikibooks. -- [[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 02:17, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

Example: {{Peekaboo|Question|Answer}}

Example code:

&lt;pre&gt;{{Peekaboo|Question|Answer}}&lt;/pre&gt;

: Yes, like {{tl|solution}}, it will be especially useful for [[Puzzles]], which has a lot of one word answers on separate pages. You might also want to change &lt;nowiki&gt;{{qif|test={{{2|}}}|then={{{2}}}|else=70%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, since {{{2}}} is already used by the answer. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 02:23, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

::I was unaware of the existence of {{tl|solution}}. I just came up with it after seeing a [Show/Hide] link in someone's TOC template. I'm still a bit mystified by all the markup, and the Template:qif page wasn't very illuminating, so how would I go about fixing qif? Change it to an unused number? What does that line do anyway? -- [[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 02:35, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

:::The show/hide part is HTML. For whatever reason, it starts open/shown unless there is more than one &quot;NavFrames&quot; there, so I got around that by calling &quot;NavFrame&quot; and then closing it at the end. For some ideas of using it, see my {{tl|French Exercises}}. Also check pages with the template using internet explorer, as it sometimes renders it wierdly.

:::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{qif|test={{{2|}}}|then={{{2}}}|else=70%}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; states that if {{{2}}} exists, dispay {{{2}}}, otherwise display 70%. So, if you type &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{Peekaboo||100px}}, the width becomes 100px. You can delete it since there probably wouldn't be situations where the width would be changed. For future reference, {{tl|switch}} is a similar template, in the format &lt;nowiki&gt; {{switch|{{{1|}}}|case: a=b|case: c=d|default=e}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;. &quot;If you type &lt;nowiki&gt; {{templatename|a}}, &lt;/nowiki&gt; you get b where a would be, etc..&quot; See [[w:Wikipedia:Qif conditionals]] and [[m:Template talk:If]]. For a real-world example, see {{tl|French Table}}.--[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 03:12, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

== Reverting vandalisms ==

I occasionally revert a vandalism from an IP address.  Often it is the only vandalism from this IP.  I was wondering what else I should be doing.  I generally leave a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:test}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; message at the IP's talk page&amp;mdash;though a quick look at [[WB:VIP]] suggests that this is not the usual practice except for logged in (non-IP) vandalisms.  Since some IP's have multiple users, that may be the better practice.  I also usually do not report the vandalism to either [[WB:VIP]] figuring that it is for recurring or unreverted vandalisms.  So, should I be continue adding &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:test}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to IP address talk pages?  Should I be reporting these somewhere (such as [[WB:VIP]], even for only one reverted vandalism?  Is there something else I should be doing?  Thanks.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:JMRyan|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/JMRyan|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/JMRyan|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:09, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

: It is not necessary to report occasional reverts of vandalism. If you find a user or IP that vandalises a lot, or a page that attracts much vandalism, you can report it at [[WB:VIP]]. In general, use [[WB:VIP]] when you want to alert other users. Also use [[WB:VIP]] if you need an [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]] to block a vandal.

: If you want, you can leave messages on the User talk page. I leave a message when I feel like, for example: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:67.184.61.166&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=429146] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:204.209.150.225&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=422356] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.21.159.19&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=421525] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.106.127.42&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=418332] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:82.5.6.177&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=417539]

: There is no standard procedure for contacting such users, and sometimes I do not. However, I do suggest that you avoid any &quot;user talk templates&quot; such as [[Template:Test]]. I find that user talk templates are good only as suggestions; none ever seems to say what I want to say. If you insist on using a user talk template, check that it is not redundant to something already on the user talk page. English Wikipedia has abused user talk templates badly, and provides examples of how '''NOT''' to use user talk templates: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:24.63.196.151] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tmchale] --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:State of the Project/2006]] ==

I've been thinking of trying to put together a formal report to the Wikimedia Foundation and other Wikimedia users on behalf of Wikibooks and what we have accomplished over this past several years.  Some really interesting and amazing things have occured, including some changes that people from outside of the project may not be aware of.

Technically, there were supposed to be monthly reports written up by community members and filed on [[meta:Reports]], but the last report for Wikibooks was file in January 2005, and it has been a year since even Wikipedia filed a report on this page.

What I'm proposing to do is to try and come up with something that represents all of Wikibooks, including the non-English projects if possible.  I know there isn't a forum for dealing with the other languages of Wikibooks, but I'm hoping some of the editors here could help out in that regard as well.  I would like to emphasis on some of the positive aspects of what has happened, including the print versions of Wikibooks (aka PDF files), significant milestones achieved, and some examples of outstanding content that has developed with Wikibooks.

The intended target of all of this is for the Foundation Board itself as well as for the other Wikimedia projects, but I would like to include this in [[meta:Wikimedia Quarto|Quarto]] as well as perhaps even make it well written enough that it could be used as a formal press release on the [[meta:Wikimedia News/2003#July 10, 2003|three-year anniversary]] of this project.

Obviously there is no huge rush to get this done, but it would be nice to get some things put together to show Wikibooks in a positive light.  There are some misunderstandings from regular users on other Wikimedia projects that don't understand what goes on here, as well as some confusion by the academic community over what Wikibooks could be.  I would like to submit this to the Foundation a little before the anniversary date so they could review it and &quot;approve it&quot; as a formal press release, adding their own comments as well.  Or simply use the big #3 as a chance to do some chest thumping and say that we are doing some cool stuff.  This shouldn't be the work of just one or two users either, which is why I'm bring it up here.  I'm also curious what anybody else thinks of this idea.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:33, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

== Wiki Embassy ==

Hello All,

While thinking of ways to contribute to the Russian Language wikibook, I came across the idea of a wikibooks embassy. I have studied Russian for some time, but would like the exercises I write to be checked by a native speaker, and it would also be nice to have audio files created by native speakers. It would be nice, I think, to have an “embassy” page where speakers of different languages could collaborate their efforts, and request help in translation. Also, wikibooks in different languages with fewer modules might want to translate some modules from en.wikibooks (and vice versa)- similar to translating pages in Wikipedia. 

An “embassy” page would be a forum for communication between two wikibooks languages (where writing in either language would be acceptable?), and people speaking different languages could better collaborate their efforts: this would be invaluable for language modules. Also, people seeking help in writing modules might ask for help from others who speak other languages, even if through a mediator who speaks both languages. It seems to me that this would improve both the English wikibooks page, and those pages in other languages. 

A similar idea for Wikiversity (which I do not really keep up with) is a collaboration with WikiNews, where people studying languages could translate WikiNews articles from one language to another, perhaps with a “head editor” to look over their translations, and provide feedback for them.  

I would love some feedback on this idea. Do you think the Russian Wikibooks Staff Lounge is adequate enough for this type of communication? Does something like this already exist? Where would this page exist: would there be a Russian embassy page on en.wikibooks, and an English embassy page on ru.wikibooks? Is translation simply too hard (and high-paying, and time-consuming) of a job to find people to do it for free, even in this community?
[[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]]

: There is already an &quot;embassy&quot; system at [[MetaWikipedia:Wikimedia Embassy]]. This lets you send messages (in English) to foreign-language Wikibooks. However, en.wikibooks did not have an embassy; as of 25 March 2006, [[User:Everlong]] is listed as ambassador, but we still do not have an embassy page like [[:de:Wikibooks:Botschaft]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:09, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

: I would like to point out that if you want to solicit help for translations between different languages, or to be able to solicit some help on inter-language issues, a good page to look at would be [[meta:Translation]], which includes a list of users and what languages they speak, and what languages they are willing to translate from.  [[meta:Category:Users by language]] has some additional people you might want to look at as well.

:In terms of a general embassy for common inter-project relations, I think this is a good idea as well, especially if you note that less than half (and going down) of all Wikibooks content is in languages other than English.  And there are some common problems to all Wikibooks projects that could use some cooperation.  Currently Wikibooks does not really speak with a common voice, or is dominated by en.wikibooks.  That is not necessarily a healthy thing.  There are some cross-project social links like [[User:Derbeth]] who is also an admin on pl.wikibooks, and I've certainly been active on meta as well.  I've thought about trying to add my name as an ambassador, but I have avoided it because I felt my plate was already too full.  I'm glad that Everlong has decided to try and take on that issue.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:26, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

:: I think we should make wider use of our meta page: [[meta:Wikibooks]]. For example, Wikinews created projects like [[meta:Wikinews/Interview of the month]]. Language books seem to be a natural place for interlanguage cooperation. Instead of discussing this issue in general-purpose &quot;embassy&quot;, we can create a project page at meta. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:22, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

: Paul, I wrote a proposal on your talk page. The [[:ru:Викиучебник:Форум|Russian Wikibooks Staff Lounge]], or the Форум as we call it, certainly ''is'' an appropriate place for enquiries such as yours. Actually, I am now in your Staff Lounge with a similar idea. I believe that we should make a '''cross-language Wikibooks forum''' (Staff Lounge, Village Pump, — whatever) for common issues.

==[[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office|Card Catalog Office]] and other sidebar issues==

I'm not sure this is consistent with the best way of searching for things and the discussions regarding categorisations above (although I do appreciate that a lot of effort, particularly Rob's, has gone into it). I do wonder though whether it has a future, and even if it does, whether it is really worthy of being linked to in the sidebar. Indeed, to my mind, the sidebar needs a bit more reorganisation, putting the links to community pages down a bit, and perhaps renaming the &quot;all bookshelves&quot; and &quot;all books&quot; bits as &quot;search by subject&quot; and &quot;search alphabetically&quot; instead, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:29, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, unless categorization in the card catalog office is ''forced'' (via a {{tl|cleanup-link}}-esque template) and {{tl|Catalog}} is used, I think the card catalog office should be scrapped altogether. (Imagine if a library only had a random half of its books catalogued.)  As for the sidebar, I think that having both a &quot;tools&quot; and a &quot;toolbox&quot; section is redundant. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 23:05, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

::The whole point of the Card Catalog Office was to bring up the issues of organizing the content of Wikibook, and have a central discussion area that was seperate from the Staff Lounge where people who are interested in organizing the ontology of Wikibooks could occur.  In that regard, I think it is still a valid project, but the problem here has always been trying to recruit people to be involved with the issue.  If the CCO is a failed experiment, so be it.  I still think major discussion about this issue needs to take place, and it will be an ongoing issue as well.  And if the CCO is being scrapped, there should be something to take its place.  If you don't think finding content on Wikibooks is a problem, and that [[Special:Allpages]] is the best solution, go ahead and scrap the CCO and the idea.

::I am opposed to a monolithic ontology for Wikibook, and the category system of MediaWiki software is also inadequate for cataloging Wikibooks as well.  Much of the problem I've been facing is to simply identify what is a Wikibook, which is precisely why I started [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical Classification]].  If you are complaining about how slow I've personally been in trying to catalog Wikibooks, you are operating on far too short of a timespan here.  This is something that is going to take time, and I've been deliberately moving slow to make sure that I've covered the major issues, as well as to identify the tools necessary to deal with the task.  It is a huge task to try and catalog anything, and with almost 15,000 pages of content and no real organization at the moment, the task for the current Wikibooks content alone is in reality something more than one person can deal with on their own. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

==request help==
I am begining to see the challenges of working here at wikibooks.
I have to confess that I'm a POV warrior, but I am trying to reform.
I keep finding myself with serious writers block. I think my biggest problem is that subliminally, I'm still an info warrior in a solitary crusade against an army of trolls. I keep trying to solve
this problem by imagining Jimbo Wales as the guy I am writing to.
This works some, but Jimbo Wales is pretty absent from my process,
and haunting his discussion page doesn't really put me in touch with his head as much as it makes me realize that lame people are everywhere.
I had a big brain storm yesterday. I was happy and proud of myself for writing a few pages in as many hours for the first time. Until i went and looked at it this morning. Its a big phat POV nightmare.
Honestly, as such things go, its more factual and truthful than almost any other POV nightmare, but its still not even something I'd
normally want anybody to see here. My original idea was to
vanish it and start over, but theres a lot of good points, and, I think that even the pov pionts could be considered as good starting
points. What I guess i am looking for is a compassionate NPOV coach,
somebody to help me draw those lines, and to help me frame my reference point in my head for who and how i should be writing.

If anybody has the spare time and energy, I'd appreciate some feedback. Please know that I have no intention of leaving the big mess up any longer than it takes to fix it.

== Wikiversity status change? ==
I noticed Wikiversity has been removed from Wikibooks main menu.  Has the Board finally moved to approve/disapprove Wikiversity or is this unilateral action by some Wikibookean at large?
[[User:Lazyquasar|Lazyquasar]] 09:35, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

:I think this is a (hopefully temporary) cock-up by the developers, who are tested out something new with the sidebar. Somehow our sidebar, which remains unchanged on [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]], has been replaced by that of the English Wikipedia! I hope normal service will be resumed shortly. I also hope that Wikiversity makes a proper go of it at Wikibooks and the proposed schism gets put to rest, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 10:09, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

::There is nothing on the part of Wikibooks administrators to formally remove Wikiversity from Wikibooks in any significant manner, and I would fight that until http://en.wikiversity.org/ was live, or some significant alternative was presented.  There was a substantial server crash that happened yesterday with the english-language server farm and I think the developers are trying to recover from that incident, together with a huge crushing load of page requests.  I suspect that the sidebar issues are a result of that issue as well, where they had to recreate some of the content from backups.  If you made any substantial edits in the past couple of days, I would strongly suggest that you review your recent contributions to see if they made it into the current database.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:19, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

== Categories Within Pages ==
Is there any way to include part of a page on another page, but not the whole page (possibly with using categories). For example, imagine a language book had 4 pages: Dialoges, Grammar, Vocabulary and Exercises- each with content organized by lesson and section. Could you create each section's page by including the grammar, dialoges, vocabulary and exercises from the 4 pages(dialoges grammar vocab and exercises)? Kind of like how [[US History/Print version]] was created, except taking only sections of pages instead of entire pages. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 11:03, 21 April 2006 (UTC)
:Use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;text to not include in transcluded page&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; around text you only want to appear on the page itself, but not on the transluded page. To only include text on another page but not on the page itself, use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;text to include only on the transcluded page&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. That may be useful for titles or categories.

:If you want to include different sections of a page on different pages, you can use 
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;{{switch|{{SUBPAGENAME}}|case: Dialogues=|case: Lesson 1=|default=hiddenStructure}}&quot;&gt;
text to only appear on pages titled &quot;Language/Dialogues&quot; and &quot;Language/Lesson 1,&quot; but not on any other page

== Wikibooks is not a depository for video game manuals ==

This is an instruction that Jimbo has added to [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=434945]. He has also noted this on [[Wikibooks talk:Computer and video games bookshelf]], where he has made it clear that, although time would be allowed for the video game manuals we have to be moved elsewhere, that they really do not belong on Wikibooks. It also seems that his thinking is that Wikibooks's scope really should be textbooks for educational reasons.

Because of the terms of WMF's educational mission charter, it seems that we have no choice on this. Personally, I must say that (even ignoring WMF's educational mission charter) I would agree with Jimmy - Wikibooks should be for textbooks, which to my mind means books that encourage or aid learning (for school, university, profesionals or for the kind of subjects you see in adult learning courses, such as cookery or flower arranging, or what have you). Video games walkthroughs quite simply do not belong.

I think we should agree a cut-off date after which video games walkthroughs will be deleted - a generous one, perhaps the end of July, say. This would give plenty of time to allow them to find a new home, whilst also making it clear that they will be removed. In isolated cases, for exceptional reasons, any deadline chosen could be extended - but the message would be that we are serious about removing them, please move your work elsewhere (could wikicities help?), you have plenty of time to do this, but do move them or your work will be lost.

In the meantime, I propose that any new video game walkthroughs that are started are speedy deletion candidates, with a requirement that a note be placed on the author's page explaining our new approach. Discussion of this proposal can be on [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]], [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:03, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

:Finally! That's good news. While I'm impressed by the depth and quality of the guides we've amassed, as textbooks they all fall flat. But this is going to be a big effort. There are many things to do now. I wonder though, what's the best way to transwiki? I assume a database dump could be downloaded and then installed on the new host server, or is cut-'n'-paste with a history list still the best way? If a database import isn't viable I can get onto contacting authors and transwikiing content right away. I suggest that rather than expect the authors to find their own hosts that they all be moved to [http://www.strategywiki.net StrategyWiki]. From there the authors can contribute or fork off to their own server as they please, and it would mean Wikibooks could be emptied by the due-date without worrying over books that didn't get dealt with in time. In closing, yay! :) [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:42, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

A number of points regarding your suggestion (which on the whole seems like a great solution):

#Is the licensing of submissions to StrategyWiki compatible with the licensing used for submissions to Wikibooks?
#Assuming the answer is yes, would StrategyWiki accept the material? (we could easily ask them that)
#We'd then need to agree with StrategyWiki how to transfer material (assuming we've dealt with 1 and 2 this should be possible, but I wouldn't want to introduce lots of material to StrategyWiki ''en masse'' in a way that disrupts what they're doing).
#Presumably once transwiki'ed (however that is achieved) we can delete each book here straightaway - though we probably ought to offer a link from the title page of each book to the StrategyWiki page for a period (a year say) so that anyone looking for it here can find it on StrategyWiki.

Finally, I have never seen StrategyWiki before. Visually it looks excellent, much better than what we've got here at Wikibooks. And it all seems to be on MediaWiki. I'm jealous. How do we get the appearance of Wikibooks to look equally excellent? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 09:18, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

:# Both are GFDL, so it's all go in that respect. :)
:# In the past they've expressed an interest in receiving WB content (and also began copying over the ever-popular [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] guide). I've mentioned this policy change over there so they can reaffirm their opinions.
:# As long as each book conforms to the subpage structure it shouldn't be too hard to manage.
:# Sounds like a good plan, as there are bound to be some incoming links for a while yet (especially from fansites and outdated WP mirrors)
:As for the visual theme, you just need time and artistic talent. :) MediaWiki skins are merely CSS stylesheets, and adding new ones is basically drag-'n'-drop. Another good example of an unrecognisable MediaWiki install is the [http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/Main_Page Elder Scrolls Construction Set Wiki]. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:54, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

Where do you drop them into? Also, what do you need to design them? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:30, 22 April 2006 (UTC)
:Anyone with access to the server can dump them into the skins folder (and also have to add a line or two to a PHP file, I think). If you were to ''replace'' an existing skin however this can all be done from the MediaWiki: namspace. All you need to design them is CSS knowledge, no special tools really.

=== So what about the other game manuals? ===
What about the Go, Chess and other game manuals on this site? Aka the [[Wikibooks:Games_bookshelf]]? Video Games may have a &quot;bad rep&quot; in the press, for I dunno whatever reason. :-/ But if this is going to be done, we need total consistancy. Nonetheless, it will be difficult for me to hang around this site if the game manuals are gone. It is no offense to Jimbo's decision, nor should this be taken as an act of resistance. His decision is his decision. At this point, no amount of disagreement can change the fate of these books. 

Well, anyway. If normal games are to stay but if video games are removed... then this motion may have a little resistance. Convincing everyone that video games are not allowed while normal games are allowed is too difficult. 

Other issues I see is convincing the Wikipedia community that Video Games are no longer allowed on this site. Somehow, that must be arranged (as far as why video games are allowed on wikipedia, but not wikibooks... but thats another story). --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:56, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

: Thus I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=435509&amp;oldid=434945 removed the new policy].

: We need to have &quot;wide acceptance among editors&quot; (perhaps excluding editors of things that belong not at Wikibooks) before we can change [[WB:WIW]], especially because the current version of [[WB:WIW]] ''does'' allow game manuals such as [[Go]], [[Football (Soccer)]], and [[MapleStory]], because they are &quot;instructional resources&quot;. We might still be able to remove [[B:CVG]] guides (and maybe some others), but we need to discuss it first. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 21:31, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

:: Video game guides ''are'' to be removed (Jimbo capitalized &quot;must&quot; afterall). That's been decided on and no amount of discussion by us will change the foundation's decision, so I don't see why you have removed the policy. Now the difficult question to answer is how far do we go from there. Is the [[Wikibooks Pokédex]], whose sole [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Archive_8#Raising_Hell|justification]] for keeping being that if game guides were accepted, it should be too, to be deleted? But regardless, ''video'' game guides are gone. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 23:31, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

----
In reply to Hagindaz, even if we are sure that we will remove video game guides, that does not mean that we are sure about the policy. Instead of banning all video game guides immediately, maybe we should take transitional steps. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 02:09, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:Well of course. That's obvious and exactly what Jimbo recommended. But, a policy against the creation of new guides should in place if indeed &quot;we are sure that we will remove video game guides,&quot; though the existing guides should be kept as long as needed. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 02:37, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

Hey, say, what happened to my earlier comments?
They just up and went vanished and i can't even find them
in the history?

My points were pretty good ones i thought.

Lets see. RE-construct. 

Yes, I agree it is a bog change seemingly.
However, the definition of the place is &quot;textbooks.&quot;
Reading below i get more information, which is nice.
Apparently that wasn't the initial total intention of the
conceptual inventor of Wikibooks.

However, my point earlier is that how to play video games
doesn't really match the mission statement here is still true
for really the same reasons. If, at long term expansion, 20 years
from now the library was well founded and big and large and complete,
the operational functional umbrella would expand that large. The problem is that Wikibooks is barely meeting the mission statement,
and that bookshelf is getting crowded. Wheres the textbook on how
to write a video game? Or on how to think in three dimensional coding? Or how to program a 3 dimensional model? Those are the kinds
of books we need, and without them, the problem is that Wikibooks ends up being a kiddie zone.

(This isn't a recontruction, i have new information..drat.)

But still, the same point is essentially true. 
People come here in good faith and see an opportunity to write
something. But maybe over the long term they fail to make it
neutral or its too pov, or its fiction, etc. If it meets some realistic criteria, we ought to keep it but shelve it on a shelf
that is useful. There are dozens of books probably on Wikipedia that
wouldn't cut &quot;TextBook.&quot; We don't need to delete them, and, it might
even be true that we don't need to move them. But they do need to exist in a place that is organized for them, and to fit into a macro
which implies a library, not a game museum. 

There are several Books we should keep that are POV encumbered. I can think of two examples off the top of my head. The &quot;Asperger Survival Guide&quot; and the &quot;Universal Religion&quot; Texts. The first is POV
as its written by a magickal thinking asperger syndrom person. The funny thing is, it is exactly the kind of reference material a pro
would die for in order to both help Asperger Syndrome folks and to
generate an annotated study of Asperger type thinking. POV in this
case means GOLD MINE. &quot;Universal Religion&quot; was a good faith attempt
but a half lucid follow through. Its POV biases are train wreck accidents and the Author isn't really a POV pusher by a long shot. 
I'd devote a week to showing how the starting premise is a good
one and show how it could be a valuable NPOV text if it went up for deletion, because its a &quot;half way there&quot; sort of book that really just needs a fresh batch of neutrality-ification authors.

=== Fiat decisions and the scope of Wikibooks ===

There are two very different visions that I see regarding Wikibooks, from two very different people as well.  One is from the &quot;founder&quot; of Wikibooks, Karl Wick.  I can't speak for him directly, but in many various places he has expressed a much more inclusive attitude toward what can appear in Wikibooks.  For myself, I feel that if you have a subject that is in Wikipedia, but it can be covered in much more depth and detail than a typical 32K article, it can become a Wikibook.  That removes the original research problems and would largly fit with what is currently in the [[WB:WIN]] list except for specific changes that Jimbo has added in the past six months or so.  In summation, Wikibooks is for books and major content that takes quite a bit of work to organize.

-----------
That is a great idea, and the broadness of the scope is a better umbrella. I think that &quot;Fiction&quot; and &quot;Pov&quot; booksehlves are really the best solution overall, but think of this in a social systems
theory perspective like Jimbo. Its not that we don't love a bunch of games, but we need to narrow the focus of our filter in order to generate the minimum bare bones product. Most of the books on Wikibooks are not only unfinished, they sort of look like maybe 
a batch of teenagers started the project and then promptly abandoned it. This is a systemic problem, and limitation of scope is one way
of resolving that systemic problem as a information systems engineer.
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 21:04, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
---------------
The other school of thought is that Wikibooks is only for strictly textbooks alone and nothing else.  That would mean that even books like [[Serial Programming]], which might be taught as a college subject but isn't very well cited or organized along a formal textbook lines with sample problems and student exercises would not qualify.  In short just about everything here on Wikibooks.  Or even more strict, if I can interpret what Jimbo seems to be saying about the content here, if it can't be found at a college bookstore then it shouldn't be here.

:[[Serial Programming]] is at least a topic proper for a textbook, and the fact that it is not yet a very good textbook is of course no grounds for deletion, but rather grounds for radical improvement.  I am certainly not saying &quot;if it can't fe bound at a college bookstore then it shouldn't be here&quot;.  We are interested in creating a complete curriculum for Kindergarten through the University level.  The proper question is: is this a textbook for a course taught in some accredited institution?  --[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 13:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

------------------

I really don't like that as a school of thought, and, I hope that isn't what Jimbo is actually saying. I think that it might be a sort of accidental hyperbole of the other school of thought; this is my interpretation of the other school of thought. Wikibooks needs to focus on making it as a library in order to attract cyclically the kind of people who will improve it as a library. If wikibooks becomes by means of content something other than a library, it will fail in the end as a useful information resource. The idea here isn't to absoluetely exclude what isn't a textbook, it is to focus all current
efforts on what wikibooks has to do in order to insure its viability as an information service.
------------------

I believe this to be way overly restrictive, and I can't really be used to judge any content that would fall under even some moderation between these two schools of thought.
--------------
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 21:04, 24 April 2006 (UTC)
If that were the actual other side, I would agree, it does seem
overly restrictive.
If it were even as much as a permenent rule, rather than an information service engineering tactic, I'd see it as a self
debilitating limitation for a any information service labeling itself a library. I hope that my interpretation of the other point
of view is closer to it than your interpretation of it, because i
think therein lies the compromises we are looking for.
--------------
More to the point, if this is something that Jimbo has been gnawing at his mind for some time (as apparently it has), I wish he would come out and say it.  If he were still paying for these servers completely out of his own pocket, I might be willing to say that he has the authority to do this huge policy shift, but he isn't and IMHO doesn't.  I guess we can't overcome a forced Wikimedia Foundation Board policy decision on this matter, but then again I think such a heavy handed approach is going to be something that will be highly detrimental to this project.  And some of the current board members, notably Anthere, feel we are being way too restrictive on the content already with Wikibooks.  If we were restrictive before, you have only just seen this get started.
:As far as I am aware, Anthere and I are in complete agreement about what should be in Wikibooks.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 13:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

::If you and Anthere were in agreement, there wouldn't have been a fight over the Wikimania proceedings being placed on Wikibooks, nor would it have even been put on Wikibooks in the first place.  Generally speaking the attitude in the past by many users, including both Anthere and Angela, was to be inclusive for the most part as long as it was kept within GFDL guidelines and was generally speaking book content.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

Mind you, as I've pointed out numerous times and in numerous places, less than 1/2 of all Wikibooks content is even in English.  If such a fiat decision is going to be made, it will also have to be enforced not only on en.wikibooks but on all Wikibooks projects.  IMHO such a major policy change (and there are video game guides for the other language Wikibooks) should involve more than even this one project as well.  I'll admit that the other language Wikibooks usually use en.wikibooks as a &quot;template&quot; to see what some general policies ought to be, but there already are some interesting differences in general policies between the various languages already.  I'm sure Derbeth could give some examples between pl.wikibooks and en.wikibooks, and pt.wikibooks (a language I speak) has a policy that excludes controvercial religious books that we allow on en.wikibooks.

:There have been no fiat decisions here!  I have merely pointed out that we have always had policy, and the policy has not been well-enforced in the past.  Wikibooks has been the victim of some well-meaning wikipedians sending junk over here.  Do not allow yourselves to become a dumping ground.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 13:34, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

::You had better believe this is a fiat decision.  You went to [[WB:WIW]] and deliberately made a specific policy change to exclude over 100 different Wikibooks.  Some of these have been started here on Wikibooks during this time when we have had a full bookshelf (a Wikibooks organizational division) created just for this content.  It wasn't as though this was something that was added without Wikibooks users knowing about it unlike the Wikimania proceedings.  While I have been one who has complained about Wikipedia dumping content on Wikibooks, this was not it, and this has not been widespread policy until now.  The debate over removing these books has been a lingering debate here, and it is my perception that one of those anti-video game guides proponents finally got you to side with them effectively ending the debate and giving rationale to act on a massive scale.  Wikibooks has been diminished as a result of this effort, and will IMHO be permanently damaged due to this action.  I still fail to see any rationale on your part Jimmy as to why this policy change was made other than you simply felt like making the change.  Thousands of hours of honest work have been destroyed and a significant group of Wikibooks users alienated and have been told to leave because of this action.  Vandals couldn't have been any worse in this regard.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:42, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

I welcome the debate over keeping or removing video game guides on Wikibooks, but this should be done through a legislative process and not through some executive order.  And it should be a policy that gets input from all Wikibooks projects, not just en.wikibooks as well.  I'm using the term legislative process as a way to say we need community concensus on this issue, but it should be way more than a couple of people saying &quot;Yeah, let's do it&quot; with perhaps one lone person saying &quot;er... it might not be so good of an idea&quot;.

My personal &quot;political&quot; stand on this issue is that video game guides should remain.  I've added some key points in [[Wikibooks talk:Game manual guidelines#For (Wikibooks should include game guides)]] including specific university-level curriculum that is currently being taught about this topic, and classes that indeed do study '''Doom''' as a classroom topic.  That is a seminal video game and is going to be studied 100 years from now because of how groundbreaking of a video game it was.  Just as '''Birth of a Nation''' is studied in university classes as a seminal motion picture today.  In addition, and policy that &quot;makes sense&quot; is going to have to be more inclusive or exclusive over content than simply video games, and is going to have to hit the core of '''What is Wikibooks''' to see if this really is just textbooks or if it is for other non-fiction works as well.  And how we define the term textbook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:22, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:Rob, I think you misunderstand what Jimbo is doing. He is responsible, as head of the Wikimedia Foundation, for making sure that WMF resources are used in line with its charter, ie its educational mission. If he did not do that he would be neglecting his role and, ultimately, putting WMF's non-profit status in jeopardy. From time to time, this does need executive order. I also think he appreciates that in practice wikibooks has allowed video games walkthroughs for some time and therefore we should give them plenty of time to arrange their departure from wikibooks to what I hope is a welcome home that will allow them to continue to develop.

:I also think that what Jimbo is asking for is that we really do enforce the bit in [[WB:WIW]] that says &quot;As a general rule, most books you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop are not acceptable because of the list of exclusions in this policy. This is for textbooks. A textbook is a book which is actually usable in an existing class.&quot; Do, however, give &quot;existing class&quot; a wide meaning as being in any accredited institution (ie don't restrict it to school). I'm sure that if you can show that a subject is studied in an existing class, and does have/need textbooks similar to a wikibook, that wikibook will remain, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:25, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

::I am not misunderstanding this... or a huge misunderstanding perhaps.  I do understand his role as &quot;head of the Wikimedia Foundation&quot;, but its charter was written after the fact... and well after Wikibooks was established as a project and these video game guides were already on Wikibooks.  This is not going to put the WMF's non-profit status in jeapordy in the least.  This is a pure political move on the part of Jimbo to try and narrow the focus of Wikibooks, and he is using his position as chair of the WMF as justification to change policies here without even so much as having a discussion about this before the policy has been changed.  That is just plain wrong to do with a project like this... even if he were even contimplating such a policy change.

::I also fail to see where the motivation is to remove an entire bookshelf of almost 100 different Wikibooks is coming from.  If this is to remove one specific Wikibook that is perhaps a bit too much, such as he did with the [[Jokebook]], perhaps I could agree or disagree but it could also be dealt with through the VfD pages.  And was.  In this case he is making a huge policy shift in the project without consultation of any of the rest of the Wikibooks community and expecting us to try and divine his thoughts on why it was done... without any comment occuring that is of any substantial depth or justification and instead relying on apologists to deal with the consequences.

::BTW, as far as video game development and study, I can give not only existing university classes that not only give instruction on these topics, but go into depth and even grant degrees in video game design.  And these are not two-bit psuedo colleges either but otherwise widely respected major universities.  The video game industry is now larger than the movie industry in terms of economic impact in the USA alone (it passed sales of movie tickets &amp; video sales some time in 2004).  It is certainly going to be having over time some colleges that will be doing things like the USC Film School is doing for the motion picture industry.  The point here is that I fail to see why an entire bookshelf needs to be abandoned and all of the contents of all of the books deleted...  especially on a decision that was not debated previously.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:29, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

::: I agree with Rob here. Jimbo Wales needs to at least point out why this decision came out of the blue like this. Should we just sit still and silently get rid of 100+ books on this site without a discussion? Again, I point to Jimbo's [[Special:Contributions/Jimbo_Wales|edits]]. I have been watching this page in hope that he will give some sort of explanation to the issue. But just looking at his edit page, it makes me feel as if Jimbo isn't a participant in this community at all, a quality that should exist in an executive don't you think? 

::: Heck, I thought as a community, we went over this already and settled that game guides *were* allowed on Wikibooks. And as such, we developed [[Wikibooks:Game_manual_guidelines]]. That page existed since early November, and the issue was discussed and I felt at least the issue was closed.

::: If Jimbo had an issue with the game guides, why didn't he talk about it when that guideline was being made? Why is it now, when the issue has been closed for 5+ months, that Jimbo says no, and the community has already moved on? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:25, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

----
There's a difference between a strategy guide/walkthrough and a book that examines the aspects of game design in a game. Because video games are unique in that they combine several art forms, the latter can easily be done, and without having any elements of a how-to book/strategy guide. Studies on novels, for example, have been written that are longer than the book they are about, aren't simply plot summaries, and are used in literature and writing classes. I see this as being similar to the difference between [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] and a Wikibook on a classic or revolutionary book. &quot;Muggles' Guide&quot; simply lists characters and summarizes chapters. And, like most video games, Harry Potter isn't anything special in its language or themes, so you wouldn't be able to write a book for classroom use.

Unless I'm forgetting a huge chunk of books, the books currently being hosted on Wikibooks fall into three divisions:
#Books that are, by any sense of the word, textbooks
##About topics taught in classrooms
##Structured in a way that wouldn't make sense for an encyclopaedia on the subject
##No question on what to do with these, obviously
#Guides/how-to books
##Would for the most part never be part of a school curriculum (though there is a small grey area)
##Video game strategy guides/walkthroughs and a book of recipes fall into this category
##May be popular enough to form their own project. See [[m:Talk:Proposals_for_new_projects#Proposal:_WikiHowTo]]
#Related encyclopaedic content
##Books like [[Wikibooks Pokédex]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] (and possibly [[Serial Programming]] in its current form)
##Only purpose would be to serve as appendices (which has been argued in the case of the Pokédex)

I think most of the disagreement is over how-to books, which are instructional resources, yet are not used in classrooms. Whether Jimbo Wales has the right to limit Wikibook's scope to simply textbooks, despite significant support for the inclusion of all instructional resources, is something that I am very interested in knowing. Perhaps dividing Wiki''books'' into separate textbooks and how-to books projects would be the best course? --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 04:24, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:I think Jimbo's response to my queries on the mailing list (see [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2006-April/002501.html]) is quite useful in this regard. Please read the email in full for the details.

----------------
I know i am a newbie aspie, but i do wish the humans would listen.
I have said repeatedly that Wikibooks needs a &quot;fiction&quot; and &quot;pov&quot;
Bookshelf. Honestly, this is the solution to most of this problem.
Just let the users know they are getting into swampy stuff by putting it out in the backyard somewhere instead of featuring it.

:The comments that you make regarding the school curriculum are too narrow. Jimbo notes &quot;The key point is that there have to be some kind of courses offered by some kind of serious institution of learning.&quot; That does not mean it has to be on the school curriculum. Books supporting adult learning courses or professional courses are, of course, welcome. For instance, serious cookery classes for adults (or children) (and I mean for amateurs not professional chefs) use cookbooks in classes, and the cookbook is most welcome. This is significantly different from a video game walkthrough, where Jimbo says &quot;My question would be whether or not there exist classes at accredited institutions on the subject which use something similar _as a textbook_.&quot;  There are lots of types of &quot;accredited institutions&quot;, and this is meant to be given a very wide meaning.

:In respect of the Pokédex, I have no idea whether Pokémon are now so big as to mean accredited institutions study it - in which case a serious study guide in line with an example syllabus would be within the allowed limits. If not, then we shouldn't have it. To my mind &quot;How-tos&quot; are largely micro-books and would be merging into a single how-to textbook on &quot;life&quot; (and I'm sure some sort of &quot;general studies&quot; or &quot;citizenship&quot; type classes cover much of this material anyway), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:17, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

:::That's wikipedia, not wikibooks. Wikipedia meets the educational mission of WMF by being an encyclopaedia, and it's reasonable to have articles on those games in an encyclopaedia.

hey, like, you could in theory write an educational style textbook using a game as a hyper reference. The book would have to be about
how to program etc. Not the game as its primary subject tho. See the difference?

==[[Wikibooks: No personal attacks]] policy changed from &quot;enforced&quot; to &quot;proposed&quot; again!==

[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] archived the discussion of this item on the 24th then changed the policy from enforced to proposed again! See [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Archive_17 Archived discussion] where for about 2 weeks no one demurred from the policy being enforced. Perhaps it was only after archiving the discussion that he spotted the change to &quot;enforced&quot; status. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 08:23, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

==Proposal to restore &quot;enforced&quot; status to [[Wikibooks: No personal attacks]] - why we need a limited constitution and enforcement apparatus==

A vote was taken at [[Wikibooks: No personal attacks]] and 10 users voted. This is a high number by Wikibooks standards. 8 of the 10 voted for the policy to be enforced. Surely reopening the issue after a vote (and several months) cannot be reasonable. I propose that the policy should be restored to enforced status.

The fact that a vote has been overturned unilaterally in the manner described is a graphic demonstration of the need for a limited constitution in the form of enforced policies and an enforcement apparatus.

At [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]] there are several proposed policies that require review. The most important of these is probably [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] so that enforced policies can be enforced. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:38, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

==Somethings happened to my account==
I've not been on wikibooks for a while and I think that possibly my account has been disabled. I can't log in, and emailing for a new password doesn't seem to work either. I've had this new account (note the capitalisation). The problem is however my admin privaledges. I run a computer club here at my school and starting on wednesday intend to get the kids to edit a new wikijuniour book of science experiments that can be done at home. The problem is that this school is on a huge shared network that regulaly gets blocked from Wikipedia because of vandals from other schools. I need to be able to unblock the network so that my (lovely, well behaved) pupils can edit (and reblock when we have finished if necessary). I also need to be able to delete pages created in error (my pupils are only 11, I expect a lot of errors). Are there any stewards here? Can someone give me admin powers on this account or reactivate the password on my other account? [[User:Theresa Knott|Theresa Knott]] 10:03, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

:Hm. A while back it was decided to de-admin inactive sysops, but you don't seem to be on that list. Anyway it could be that removing your powers somehow glitched your whole account. I'm not sure about stewards, but I'm pretty sure beaureucrats can give sysop status too. In which case try [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] or [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]].

== Cookbooks categorisation system ==

Hello,

Is there a staff lounge specifically for Cookbooks? I couldn't find one. (Like maybe, hmm, [[Cookbook:Kitchen]]? :))

I wanted to ask what the story is with cookbooks categorisation. I've spent a fair bit of time at Commons and they're (necessarily) pretty strict about categorisation norms. I started 'fixing' a bunch of pages then realised it might not be appropriate. Is there guidelines anywhere?

How is [[Cookbook:Recipes]] (the index) kept up to date? Is there a way to see all the recipes, or is the best bet [[Special:Allpages]]?

This is an FYI to all Wikibooks users, that a recent change in MediaWiki software on the latest round up updates has included a feature for marking accounts with the 'bot (for robot or automated) flag on accounts can now be set locally without having to deal with stewards on meta.  This is now an &quot;additional&quot; responsibility that can be performed by bureaucrats.

As usual, you should still use the [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Requests for bot status]] to let everybody know that you want to have the bot flag added to an account, but you no longer have to make the request on meta after the decision has been made unless there aren't any active bureaucrats that are paying attention.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:43, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

I'm just letting everyone know that some of my pupils will be working on some wikijunior pages with me over the next 5 weeks. You will recognise them because they all have (knott) in brackets after a nickname. If you have any problems with them please let me know. It would be nice if someone welcomed them, and edited some of their pages. Their spelling and grammar is likely to be in need of a little help, and thier formatting will be terrible at first.

: ''For projects which are deemed outside the scope, as an alternative to deletion, it might be a good idea to have &quot;Votes for adoption&quot; - books tagged in this form could continue to be developed for the time being, but people would be encouraged to find a different, free content wiki to host them.

&quot;... sorted by number of non-comment lines of code. ...&quot;

=== C: Built-in Quicksort function ===

In [[Wikipedia:C programming language|C]] (and thus also [[Wikipedia:C Plus Plus|C++]]) there is a built-in Quicksort implementation called &quot;&lt;code&gt;qsort&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, as from [http://www.cplusplus.com/ref/cstdlib/qsort.html]. Should this be mentioned? --[[Wikipedia:User:210.6.198.187|210.6.198.187]] 08:07, 4 May 2005 (UTC)
:I don't think the qsort() function is technically required by the standard to use quicksort, despite its name, but sure, maybe. [[Wikipedia:User:Dcoetzee|Deco]] 02:39, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

=== I've discovered an optimization ===

I've discovered an optimization for the standard quicksort algorithm that could be useful in many of these implementations. I have tested it to be sure it works (other optimizations I thought about were in fact slower, because they added cache faults). I didn't got the idea from any other site, it's just my personal work, and I would want to release the information as GNU, appearing as a contributor.

It's very late at night, so I can't talk more about it. I'll recheck this page in a few days to see if there's someone interested. It's my first time here, so if someone could help me explaining what steps I should take, it would be great. I don't know HTML (yet), if that's important. If there's something I should learn first, please tell me so.

Thank you!
:Well, this page is for discussing this article, but if you have a good idea that's great. I would be advised though that a lot of really smart people have put time into engineering fast quicksort implementations and you're quite possibly rediscovering something or missing something. You're also a little confused about software licenses. The GNU software license is called the GPL, and you can only release ''documents'' such as source code under it, not algorithms or ideas (these can be patented, but this isn't usually worthwhile). If you want to tell everybody about it, though, you could try a newsgroup like comp.programming. [[Wikipedia:User:Dcoetzee|Deco]] 08:57, 19 May 2005 (UTC)


::Maybe someone else discovered it before me, but the optimization doesn't appear on this article, so I'm free to post it as mine, and allow anyone to modify it. I'm aware of the GPL, and I was referring to the source code, and the text I posted on the other article explaining how it worked.

Here you have a simple C source code, which only sorts arrays of integers with the 'less than' comparison:

  //Quicksort Implementation without swap by DrJones
  void quicksort(int *start, int *end) {
       if (start&lt;end) {
            MEDIAN(*start, start[1], *end);
            register int pivot=start[1];
            register int *i=start+1;
            register int *j=end;
            for (;;) {
                 while (pivot&lt;*--j) ;
                 if (j&lt;=i)
                      break; //j may be lower than i
                 *i=*j;
                 while (*++i&lt;pivot) ;
                 if (j&lt;=i) {
                      i=j;
                      break; //i may be lower than j, as the test comparison comes after the 'while'
                 }
                 *j=*i;
            }
            *i=pivote;
            quicksort(start, i-1);
            quicksort(i+1, end);
       } //end of 'if(start&lt;end)'
  } //end of method

Some points:

*MEDIAN(a,b,c) is not described here, it's a function that put on position 'a' the lowest of the three elements, then put on position 'c' the highest of the elements, and the remaining element on position b.
*This code can be improved, but I chose not to do it, so I could focus on the replacement for the swap method. Feel free to post a code which uses all optimizations available.
*The code with the swap method could be as follows:

  //Quicksort Implementation with swap by DrJones
  void quicksort(int *start, int *end) {
       if (start&lt;end) {
            register int pivot=start[1]; //though it could be any, I suggest (start+end)/2
            register int *i=start;
            register int *j=end;
            while (i&lt;j) {
                 while (pivot&lt;*j) --j;
                 while (*i&lt;pivot) ++i;
                 swap(i, j);
                 i++; j--;
            }
            quicksort(start, i-1);
            quicksort(i+1, end);
       } //end of if
  } //end of method

:I'd say you have an infinite loop there. It will happen when the pivot value appears more than once. When i and j reach those elements, the conditions of the inner loops won't be met any more; i and j will not change, and the two pivots will be swapped once and again... forever --[[Wikipedia:User:Comocomocomocomo|Comocomocomocomo]] 16:15, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::Yes, you are right. I made a quick fix, but I haven't tried if it works yet. [[Wikipedia:User:CarlosHoyos|DrJones]] 15:15, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

I wrote back the code. I hope you can understand it, I'm not used to write these things. [[Wikipedia:User:CarlosHoyos|DrJones]] 09:55, 22 May 2005 (UTC)


:You don't have to remove anything from here if you don't want to. Most of our policies don't apply to talk pages. [[Wikipedia:User:Dcoetzee|Deco]] 23:46, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

I finally found a webpage that could be interesting: http://linux.wku.edu/~lamonml/algor/sort/quick.html

At this time, it's down, so I had to read the page on Google's Cache. It uses the method I found instead of swapping, but it has to do a lot more comparisons in its inner loop than mine, to prevent one index surpassing the other.

It seems my code could be included on the main page, afterall.

Here you got a macro function for the MEDIAN function, if you want.

  #define SWAP(x,y) register int temp = (x); (x) = (y); (y) = temp
  #define MEDIAN(a, b, c) \
          if (c&lt;b) { SWAP(b, c); } \
          if (b&lt;a) { SWAP(a, b); \
                     if (c&lt;b) { SWAP(c, b); } \
          }

This MEDIAN macro works '''exactly''' as the insertion algorithm for 3 elements. I wrote it using a SWAP macro for clarity, but I feel it's weird using the SWAP function here, when I'm not using it on the Inner loop. Other thing I don't know if would be an enhacement, is using '''for(;;)''' instead of '''while(1)'''. I'm going to write it on the code anyways.

        stack[top++] = end;
      }

    else                          // Otherwise, push the low

      if (j&gt;beg)
      {                           // The last pushed part will
        stack[top++] = beg;       // be popped inmediately. The
        stack[top++] = j;         // other one will remain in
      }                           // the stack until later.
                                  // Therefore, it's better to
      if (end&gt;i)                  // push first the longer one
      {                           // in order to achieve an
        stack[top++] = i;         // efficient usage of the
        stack[top++] = end;       // stack. This way, stack
      }                           // overflow is avoided while
    }                             // count remains &lt; pow(2,MAX)
  }
  while (top);  // ---- END OF TASK LOOP ----
}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Most implementations use function recursion. In the worst case (where the chosen pivot value allways happens to be the minimum or the maximun) the maximun recursion level will be O(n). I propose using a stack array in order to apply [[Wikipedia:tail recursion|tail recursion]] in the critical recursive call. --[[Wikipedia:User:Comocomocomocomo|Comocomocomocomo]] 16:37, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:Explicit stacks are not necessary to implement the partially tail recursive variant. It suffices to use a loop and only make a recursive call on the smaller of the two sublists, as the pseudocode [[Wikipedia:Quicksort#Limiting_worst-case_memory_usage|here]] shows. On the other hand, explicit stacks can save a significant amount of time/space overhead because of all the other junk that standard calling conventions tend to throw on the stack; it's a good idea to use one in an efficient implementation, but (no offense) not particularly innovative. [[Wikipedia:User:Dcoetzee|Deco]] 19:49, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::Don't worry, I'm not trying to invent anything new. I just want to write a '''fast''' implementation (pivot taken from the middle or from a pos. at random, minimun number of swap operations...) and make it '''comprehensible'''. I intentionally discarded other refinements (general implementation with pointers to functions or C++ templates, saving push/pop operations...). So, my question is: do you find it easy to understand? (Not only for expert programmers, but for beginners too) If not, what would you change? --[[Wikipedia:User:Comocomocomocomo|Como]] 10:56, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

=== Wikisource ===

Wouldn't this article be better placed at [[Wikipedia:Wikisource:Main page|Wikisource]]? Wikipedia already has a [[Wikipedia:Quicksort|Quicksort]] article, and unlike Wikipedia, Wikisource is intended to be a repository of things like sample implementations. They already have a [[Wikipedia:Wikisource:Quicksort|Wikisource:Quicksort]] page - it could easily be expanded with the content of this article. --[[Wikipedia:User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 03:16, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
:That's a possibility, but it would make it impossible to do the transclusion trick where we include a few of the implementations in both [[Wikipedia:quicksort|quicksort]] and this page. I've proposed elsewhere that there should be a project for code with a suitable license, but that got nowhere. [[Wikipedia:User:Deco|Deco]] 04:25, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

::Ah. Then maybe the question I should have asked was whether or not Wikipedia should include sample implementations of algorithms at all. IMHO it would be more appropriate to point to external sites that carry sample implementations, instead of having (unverified, potentially buggy) sample implementations of every algorithm, in every language. Unfortunately, I suspect that trying to achieve a consensus answer to the question of sample implementations is likely to lead into the same kind of interminable debate that the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Wikicode|Wikipedia:Wikicode]] proposal provoked... --[[Wikipedia:User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 06:08, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

:::I moved these to here to provide a way of removing large amounts of content from the Quicksort article without upsetting the innumerable contributors who inexplicably enjoy adding sample implementations. I think it's alright as long as it's separated from the main content and its purpose is clear. It might be compared to lists of minor characters from a TV series or video game or [[Wikipedia:Notable lines in the Star Wars series|Notable lines in the Star Wars series]]. Incidentally, I'm glad you're familiar with my ill-fated proposal. 08:33, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

::::Oh, I agree with your approach. It seems like a reasonable compromise, given the small likelihood that I could ever get consensus for my own personal views on the matter. And I certainly think it's better to have these things on a separate page from the main article. I just wanted to get my opinion &quot;on record&quot; so to speak :-)
::::Going slightly off on a tangent: I thought wikicode seemed like a reasonable proposal, and I may well have supported if I'd been a contributor when the debates were going on. Much like this article, it's not what I would consider ideal (the curly braces bug me a bit for starters), but after reading through some of the debate it seems like the best compromise between the various viewpoints. I applaud your ability to find workable solutions! I'll most likely end up using wikicode or some close derivative of it for any pseudocoding I need to do here. I may even see if I can get [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer science|Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer science]] to adopt it as part of some kind of style guideline. --[[Wikipedia:User:Allan McInnes|Allan McInnes]] 10:21, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Bad History? ===

I am puzzled that the history of the Quicksort Implementations page seems
to be corrupted.   For example, compare the following  two versions:

* 2005-11-18 21.42.19 (PST) DCoetzee - A less obtuse J example
* 2005-11-28 19.25.16 (PST) DCoetzee - Mathematica - a test driver

I am pretty sure that at that time the &quot;Core implementations&quot;
contains a &quot;obtuse J example&quot;.  The comment in the J example
(the comment is still there in the current revision) also
indicates that at that time, there was a J example in the 
&quot;Core implementations&quot;.  Yet I can not find any revision of
the page that has the J example in the Core implementations.
[[Wikipedia:User:Roger Hui|Roger Hui]] 08:02, 28 January 2006 (UTC)
:You're looking at the wrong page. Mere hours ago, editor R. Koot removed swathes of content from the core implementations template. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Quicksort_core_implementations&amp;oldid=35539731 Here's] how it looked before. I'm reverting it. [[Wikipedia:User:Deco|Deco]] 08:36, 28 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Encyclopedic content? ===

[[Wikipedia:WP:WWIN#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files|WP:WWIN#Wikipedia is not a mirror or a repository of links, images, or media files]] says, explicitly, that wikipedia is not:

:&quot;Mere collections of public domain or other source material such as entire books or source code...&quot;

This page looks an awful lot like a mere collection of source code; is it really encyclopedic in nature?  If so, what is its importance?  It seems to me that quicksort implementations belong somewhere else, like the Great Compiler Shootout or Sourceforge.  --[[Wikipedia:User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 05:17, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

:Or Wikisource. The only problem is that it makes it harder to share the implementations at the top with the [[Wikipedia:quicksort|quicksort]] page if they're on another site. I created the article originally to get implementations out of the quicksort article, which people feel compelled to add implementations to. [[Wikipedia:User:Deco|Deco]] 06:44, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

::Isn't that the point?  An [[Wikipedia:encyclopedia|encyclopedia]] article on Quicksort shouldn't contain any more implementations than required to describe the algorithm.  If people feel compelled to add them, they should add them to a code repository, not Wikipedia.  --[[Wikipedia:User:Donhalcon|bmills]] 15:13, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
&lt;/div&gt;

== Why is this here? ==

@''The first C implementation above does not sort the list properly if the initial input is a reverse sorted list, or any time in which the pivot turns out be the largest element in the list'':

If it's not a proper quicksort, then why is it here? It should be fixed or removed. [[User:82.139.85.118|82.139.85.118]] 01:21, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

:Agreed, if it is failed, why is it here? [[User:Rursus|Rursus]] ([[User talk:Rursus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Rursus|contribs]]) 18:54, 3 December 2011 (UTC)

== what on earth?? ==

why do you choose really random pivot.. choose the first one.

=== Python 3K ===

I'm just wondering if the Python version runs under Py3K. I haven't got Py3K up and running on any boxes yet, and I haven't worked with Python for a while, so I was wondering if anyone knew? [[User:Tinned Tuna|Tinned Tuna]] ([[User talk:Tinned Tuna|talk]])</text>

This wikibook is going to be an introductory text about electric circuits. It will cover some the basics of electric circuit theory, circuit analysis, and will touch on circuit design. This book will serve as a companion reference for a 1st year of an Electrical Engineering undergraduate curriculum. Topics covered include AC and DC circuits, passive circuit components, phasors, and RLC circuits. The focus is on students of an electrical engineering undergraduate program. Hobbyists would benefit more from reading [[Electronics]] instead.

''This book is not nearly completed, and could still be improved. People with knowledge of the subject are encouraged to contribute.''

The main editable text of this book is located at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Circuit_Theory. The wikibooks version of this text is considered the most up-to-date version, and is the best place to edit this book and contribute to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In process of translation from Finnish to English



The Elative case is one of the locative cases in Finnish that indicates movement away from an internal situation.

The case ending of the elative is either -sta or -stä according to vowel harmony rules.

For example

'''kissasta'''  ''from the cat'' '''kissa''' ''cat'' 
'''koirasta'''  ''from the dog'' '''koira''' ''dog''
'''lehmästä''   ''from a cow''  '''lehmä''' ''cow''
'''keskuksesta  ''from the centre'' '''keskus''' ''centre/town centre''


The plural adds an -i- and the last vowel or consonant in the stem may change or disappear

'''kiss/o-ista''' ''from the cats''
'''koir/-ista'''  ''from the dogs''
'''lehm/-istä'''  ''from the cows''
'''keskuksista''' ''from the centre''


Together with the inessive (or internal locative case) and the illative (or the internally directed locative case),  the elative is one of the internal locative cases. 

In its basic meaning the elative conveys a meaning which in English is rendered by the word ''from'', or the words ''out of''., meaning coming out of some place which has an internally locative case.  So having been '''kaupassa''' ''in a shop'' one will eventually ''tule kaupasta''' ''come out of the shop''.  Similarly we can say

'''koulusta''' ''out of school''
'''autosta''' ''out of the car''
'''sairaalasta''' '''out of hospital''




  , meaning in a concrete fashion, an exit from an internal situation. (siitä?  from it?) is one abstract step usage

Perusmerkitykseltään elatiivi on erosija, tarkoittaa konkreettisesti poistumista jonkin sisältä: talosta. Siitä on askel abstraktimpaan käyttöön: Havahduin mietteistäni. Suomessa usein jossakin kiinni olemista ilmaistaan sisäpaikallissijalla, joten on loogista, että otamme hatun päästä ja harjaamme pölyt vaatteistamme. Myös ulosmenoaukkoa ilmaistaan elatiivilla: Hyppäsimme ikkunasta. Puhe meni toisesta korvasta sisään, toisesta ulos. Kuten monilla muillakin sijamuodoilla, myös elatiivilla on muitakin merkityksiä kuin perusmerkityksensä. Esimerkkejä:

Alkuperä: Tein takin vanhasta mekostani. Itku pitkästä ilosta. Lehdet alkavat tyvestä. Hänestä tuli opettaja. 
Puuttuminen: Takista puuttuu nappi. 
Estäminen tai estyminen (liittyy useimmiten verbin infinitiiviin): Estin häntä lähtemästä. Varoitin häntä putoamasta. 
Syy, aihe: Miestä epäillään murhasta. Sydämeni pakahtuu surusta. 
Puhuminen, tietäminen, tunteminen: Hän puhui sinusta. Mistä sen tiedät? Iloitsen menestyksestäsi. Pidätkö vihreästä teestä? 
Kiinni pitäminen: Pidä minua kädestä. Ota kiinni kaiteesta. 
Mielipide: Minusta tuo on ruma. Omasta mielestäni onnistuin. 
Maksaminen: Myin vanhan autoni tuhannesta eurosta. Tässä satanen vaivoistasi. 
Aika: alkuviikosta, heti aamusta 
Muita: Hän on sekaisin päästään, tiukka arvostaan. Sovimme asiasta. Sali täyttyi ihmisistä. Housut repesivät takapuolesta.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consult a marine store for advice on power systems.  In general many problems applying to van dwelling are equally applicable to boating and vice versa.

Power will probably be hard to come by without some money.  That said, you can try going to some place where old batteries are discharged.  Supposedly, if a commercial grade computer UPS dies, sometimes it will be only be one of the batteries that have died, and the others are salvageable.  Many products proport to be able to restore batteries killed through misuse, and not the normal abrupt battery death.


===Typical Power Needs===

Depending on your needs you may or may not even need power.  If you are in survival mode and without cash, you may not even need any power.  My goal is to be able to study and learn and contribute back to the internet via programming.  For this I need a permanent and cheap way of living.  Hence my van is essentially a computing pod and therefore has moderate power needs.

===Power Storage===

Consult the [[http://www.uuhome.de/william.darden/index.htm Deep cycle battery FAQ]]

Purchase a deep cycle battery or (untested) dual cycle.  A friend recommends purchasing 4 batteries, wiring them in parallel, and then setting up a diode from the alternator or generator to charge them whenever the engine is on.

==Power Generation==

Misc:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park at an RV station once a week to recharge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

===Generator===

Generators are the most practical but they require gas.  There are new efficient and quiet models which probably will help with discretion.

===Microhydro Power===

This is the most constraining in terms of location but can generate lots of sustainable power.  Consult the standard references.

===Solar Power===

Solar power generation is expensive but recalcitrant.

The panels were more fragile then I expected.

Putting solar panels on top of the van blows cover and makes you are target of theft and vandalism.  I put them in the passenger compartment right behind the seats, and there is an unquantified charge on the charge controller. The biggest problem is that they are detectable at point blank.  If you have a cargo van with racks you can try hiding them in a ladder or something, and/or placing a tarp over them that you can control showing them.  Another technique is to blend and mask them on the roof, maybe using wire or something that obscures visibility, to the detriment of efficiency.

If you are out camping then you can simply let them outside provided they don't exceed the scope of your security system.

===Human Power===

Setting up a magnetic resistance bicycle to generate power could work but would not generate usable amounts of power for larger applications.

Hey, people what's up?

== Welcome to Wikibooks ==

Welcome to Wikibooks. I hope you enjoy your time here.

I see you have started a new Wikibook, [[Basketball]], and thought it might be useful to set out the scope of Wikibooks so that you can make sure your new book falls within it. Essentially, our scope can be summed up in one word. Wikibooks is for &quot;textbooks&quot;. Anything that is a textbook is within our scope, anything that is not a textbook is not. This can make it difficult for sports subjects. A book on coaching basketball, to help people learn how to play the game, including lots of useful coaching tips, for example, would fall within our scope. And such a book will probably include information about what basketball is and what its history, including the names of some great players - but by way of background information rather than as the main thrust of the book. A general book about the sport - saying who won what division when, a Who's Who guide of all current players in the NBA, and containing lots of latest basketball news stories - would not, however, be a textbook and would not fall within our scope. I hope that by outlining this early, you will avoid some of the pitfalls others have fallen into. If you have further queries, don't hesitate to ask. All the best, and happy writing! [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:08, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

Thanks, I know what you mean.  I was planning to include history, more rules, strategic tips, and skill tips.  I wouldn't want to focus on current NBA players, anyone can look that up.  I want to teach the game of basketball.

== [[Life Situations]] ==

I just wanted to let you know that the [[Life Situations]] book was nominated for deletion at [[WB:VFD]], and that the current concensus (by a vote of 4-0) is to delete that book. Some of the main problems cited are NPOV violations and Original Research material. I would like to give you an opportunity to save a copy of that book if you wish, but whether you keep a copy or not it is likely to be deleted in a week or so. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:18, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Heuristics for securing a van.

Buy:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A locking gas cap to prevent contamination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Have installed:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto security system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tinted windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;?Taped? windows (to make it harder to break glass in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wire the entire body to a livestock-style electric fence generator! Hah! Runs on 12VDC!  Oh - (but shut it off while you are at home)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install a hidden switch between the ignition and fuel pump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Tips:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always park in areas of high traffic and visibility to deter theft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disguise the van to be an old work van.  Leave &quot;evidence&quot; of it being a work van, such as various trade tools in the front.  Keep it dirty.  (Although also keep in mind that if the van appears to be full of expensive tools, it can attract the attention of thieves.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Van should pass point-blank review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dress like a worker particular to that trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put a for sale sign in the window to purchase cover (plus if someone is willing to pay 2X retail you are in luck!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy an automotive security system.  Wire it so that you are able to set it off.  That way, when someone comes near the van, and you assess that they mean it no good, you can set it off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hide your important items so that a thief that goes through your van without stealing it outright will not find much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why contribute?==
When working on this project, remember that it's aimed at children. It's more important to be understood than to be precisely accurate on every detail. (Still, try not to &quot;dumb down&quot; things to the point that they are unnecessarily &lt;u&gt;in&lt;/u&gt;accurate.)  Use technical vocabulary when you have to, but don't use big words where simpler ones would work ust as well.  Whenever you need to use a hard word, list it in the [[Wikijunior:Languages/Glossary|glossary of basic terms]], and define it.  If you don't think you can give a good definition, note on the glossary page that the term needs to be defined so someone else can try to do that for you.  Giving definitions in the article itself when such words are used is generally a good idea as well.  You can view the source of the [[Wikijunior:Languages/Introduction|Introduction]] for the wiki syntax necessary to do this.

This book is intended to be a basic ''survey'' of different languages, not an in-depth study worthy of a foreign language course.  Still, feel free to expand or even add sections if you feel further detail is needed.  Remember, Wikijunior and Wikibooks &quot;are not paper&quot; — we don't have artificial limitations on article size (although keep in mind that the target audience might be turned off by extremely long articles).  Unique cultural traits and circumstances of the societies in which these languages are used should be explored beyond just the basic set of questions listed below.

If you can contribute to this book, please do so.  Many sections are in need of cleanup and complete rewrites. You can work on almost anything including this page, but if you want to make some significant changes please bring them up [[Talk:Wikijunior Languages|on the discussion page]].  Adding new languages is encouraged, but please try to add some substantial content if you do create a new article (i.e., don't just stop at a single-sentence description).

==Beginning your article==

The best way to create a new page is to link to the title from an existing page. If you're a registered user, you might want to start your article as a subpage of your [[Special:Mypage|user page]] and copy it into the [[Help:Pages#Basic namespaces|Wikijunior namespace]] only when you're ready. If so, edit your user page and add a link like
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''New_language'']]&lt;/tt&gt;
somewhere on the page (you can use the name of the language you want to work on instead of the &quot;dummy title&quot; ''New_language''). Save the page and then follow the link to start editing the article.

If you prefer to start the article in the Wikijunior namespace itself, you can edit ''any'' page (for example, this one) and add a link like
: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Wikijunior:Languages/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''New_language'']]&lt;/tt&gt;
somewhere on the page. Using this procedure, you '''must''' substitute the name of the language you want to create an article for in place of the text &quot;''New_language''&quot;.  '''Do not''' save the page, just &quot;preview&quot; it. This gives you a link you can follow to start editing the article (confirm that you want to navigate away from the page you're editing, if asked).

Once you're editing the article, copy and paste the following text into the editing window.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
==How many people speak this language?==
==Where is this language spoken?==
==What is the history of this language?==
==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
==What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?==
==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==
==References==
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Footer}}
&lt;!-- categories would go here --&gt;
&lt;!-- interlanguage links would go here --&gt;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Work on the article to your heart's content. When you think it's worth &quot;publishing&quot;, link to it from [[Wikijunior:Languages]], [[Template:Wikijunior:Languages]], and [[Template:Wikijunior:Languages/Footer]]. Please don't do this until you have useful content in every section.

==Major questions==
As you can see, the questions (''with answers'') that must appear in every article are:
* What writing system(s) does this language use?
* How many people speak this language?
* Where is this language spoken?
* What is the history of this language?
* Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?
* What are some basic words in this language that I can learn?
* What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language? ''(include translation if possible)''

Caramel is a form of sugar that is used in candies, baked goods, desserts, dips, sauces and other prepared food products.

== The Science of Caramel ==
Caramel is essentially cooked sugar.  As sugar (sucrose) increases in temperature, it loses water molecules from its structure and reacts in a process similar to browning that results in the creation of many complex molecules.  These molecules provide the deep, rich flavors and colors that make caramel so special.

There are two basic ways to make caramel:  the dry method and the wet method.  The dry method, which involves slowly heating sugar alone, is more difficult. The sugar begins browning from the edges in, and must be repeatedly folded into the center until all sugar changes color and before it begins smoking excessively. Other ingredients are then rapidly added.

In the wet method, sugar is dissolved in water, then boiled until the water starts to evaporate. As the water escapes, the solution passes through a series of stages that indicates the ratio of water and sugar.  This ratio is directly proportionate to the temperature so if you understand the stages, you do not need a candy thermometer. 

Nevertheless, use of a thermometer minimizes the handling of the (very) hot mixture, and allows any mistakes to be easily adjusted. If your caramels are too soft, simply heat (or reheat) the mixture a few degrees higher. If too hard, simply add water, stir, and pour at a few degrees lower.
 
The stages of a sugar solution are generally described by the solution's behavior when dropped into cold water:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread Stage (230-234°F) - the solution thickens into syrupy threads when you pull a spoon out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft Ball Stage (234-240°F) - the solution can be pressed into a soft gooey ball.  Used to make soft chewy candies like taffy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firm Ball Stage (244-250°F) - the solution can be pressed into a firm ball.  Used to make caramels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard Ball Stage (260°F) - the solution can be pressed into a dense, slightly malleable ball.  Used to make harder chewy candies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft Crack Stage (270°F) - the solution solidifies into a glass-like solid that slowly bends  under light pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard Crack Stage (300°F) - the solution solidifies into a hard glass-like solid that breaks or cracks under pressure.  Used to make hard candies and brittles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Caramel Stage''' (310-349°F) - An advanced crack stage, defined by the development of an amber color that becomes tan, brown and eventually dark brown as the temperature continues to rise.  Also defined by the development of caramel flavors which becomes deeper, less sweet and more bitter as it darkens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burned Stage (350°F) - The sugar smokes and eventually turns black. It is completely oxidized (burned) and inedible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

As the water evaporates, the solution becomes super-saturated (contains more dissolved solid than can normally be held by water).  As a result, the sugar will want to re-crystallize.  Once the sugar is dissolved, do not disturb or contaminate the pot or it may spontaneously crystallize into crunchy &quot;candy&quot; and you will have to stir in water and redo this step.  The thermal reaction in &quot;wet&quot; caramel causes some invert sugar to be formed, but at least 10% of sugars by mass should be of invert form to prevent crystallization. Adding a tablespoon of corn syrup per cup of sugar is the easiest way to accomplish this at home, and strongly recommended if you plan to make caramels containing anything solid at room temperature, like chocolate or nuts.

Caramelized sugar by itself solidifies to a glass-like consistency.  For a more usable consistency liquid and/or fat are added.  The ingredients listed in the recipes below result in thick but workable products that soften significantly when warmed.  By using less liquid and fat or a higher temperature, you can increase the thickness so that the caramel can be used for dipping apples, making chewy candy, nut brittles, or even art. 

If you're producing caramelized sugar for later use, e.g. making your own invert sugar with a pinch of citric acid (sour salt), you can safely store the hardened caramelized sugar in a glass jar. Simply put the jar in a cold oven, bring to 300°F, and pour. Follow the same procedure when reheating to liquid form to avoid thermal shock.

== Caramel Sauce ==

The softer caramel products, such as this recipe for caramel sauce, contain fat and liquid in addition to the caramelized sugar.  To create the texture of caramel sauce, you need a 1:1 ratio of fat and liquid.  In this recipe, heavy cream (40% fat) is used along with butter to achieve the 1:1 fat:liquid ratio.  If you want to substitute milk you will need to use less milk and more butter to keep the ratio.  You can also substitute soy-milk and margarine to make a vegan caramel sauce, but make sure to keep the fat:liquid ratio.

This recipe makes approximately 6 cups of caramel sauce.  You can easily halve this recipe if you wish.  It takes 30-60 minutes depending how quickly you are evaporating the water.  If sealed in clean canning jars, the sauce can be stored for 3 months without refrigeration.  Or store refrigerated for up to 6 months.

&lt;b&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Cups Water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Cups Sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Tbsp Corn Syrup (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pinch Salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 Cups Heavy Whipping Cream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1/2 Cup (1 stick) Unsalted Butter, chopped into 1&quot; cubes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Safety&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding liquid to sugar that is over 300°F is dangerous!  Some of the liquid will immediately flash to super-hot steam.  To avoid steam burns, stay back from the pot and pour liquids at arms length.  Use an oven mitt for your hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you add your liquid to the hot sugar, it will boil violently.  To avoid messy and dangerous boil-overs, a 2.5 quart heavy bottomed sauce pan or pot is the minimum, but 3-4 quarts is recommended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a heat proof spatula or spoon such as wood or silicone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Dissolve the water, sugar and corn syrup over medium high heat until fully dissolved.
[[Image:Caramel_sugar_water_th.jpg|none]] 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stop stirring&lt;/u&gt; and let the solution boil over medium heat.  Check on the solution every 5 minutes.  You will see the bubbles slow down and get larger.  When the bubbles begin to reach 1/2&quot; to 3/4&quot; start monitoring the solution frequently.
[[Image:Caramel_soft_ball_stage_th.jpg|none]] 
&lt;br&gt;When the solution begins to turn amber, get your cream and butter and watch it constantly.
[[Image:Caramel_crack_stage_th.jpg|none]] 
&lt;br&gt;When the solution has turned a shade of caramel that you like (darker is deeper and will start to take on a little bitterness), step back and add the cream at arms length, stirring constantly and scraping the sides of the pan.
[[Image:Caramel_added_cream_th.jpg|none]] 
&lt;br&gt;Add the butter and stir until incorporated.  Pour the sauce into a serving dish for immediate serving with bread, drizzled on ice cream, as a garnish or for use in other desserts.
[[Image:Caramel_Added_butter2_th.jpg|none]] 
&lt;br&gt;If you desire, follow standard canning procedures and distribute into canning jars.  Allow to cool until the buttons are depressed.  Any jars with buttons that are not depressed should be refrigerated and consumed first.  To reheat the caramel sauce, microwave the jars (without covers) for 10-30 seconds depending how soft and hot you want it.

== Other Caramel Options ==
The following are all variations that can be made at different stages of the recipe above.

&lt;b&gt;Simple Syrup&lt;/b&gt;
The first step in the recipe was to dissolve two parts sugar in one part water.  This creates a simple syrup, perfect for sweetening cold drinks (e.g. Iced Tea) without having to wait for granulated sugar to dissolve.

&lt;b&gt;Caramel Chews&lt;/b&gt;
Replace the cream with 3/4 Cup Half &amp; Half.  Pour the hot mixture onto a silicone mat or parchment paper to cool.  When it is cool enough to handle, fold and knead the caramel a few times, then break into bite size pieces.  Allow to cool completely before wrapping individually.

&lt;b&gt;Turtles&lt;/b&gt;
Replace the cream with 3/4 Cup Half &amp; Half.  Pour the hot mixture over 4 cups of your favorite nut on a silicone mat or parchment paper to cool.  When it is cool enough to handle, fold and knead the caramel until the nuts are fully distributed, then break into bite size pieces.  Melt chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave and dip the turtles or simply drizzle chocolate on top.

&lt;b&gt;Toffee&lt;/b&gt;
Instead of cream, use 7 sticks of butter (a total of 8 sticks or 4 cups, so you have equal parts butter and sugar).  Mix in chopped nuts if desired.  Pour onto a silicone mat or parchment paper or molds.  After cool drizzle or dip with chocolate and chopped nuts.

&lt;b&gt;Nut Brittle&lt;/b&gt;
Do not use any cream or butter.  Stir in 1/2 tsp. baking soda (optional), then pour the molten caramel over 4 cups of your favorite nuts on a silicone mat or parchment paper and let it cool.  When it has reached room temperature, break it up with a mallet or by dropping the sheet on the counter.  Wrap and store in an air-tight container.

&lt;b&gt;Sugar Art&lt;/b&gt;
You can do this at any point during the hard crack or caramel stages.  Remove the sugar from the heat and allow to cool for one minute.  Using a spoon, let the syrup drip off.  If it drips in globs, let it cool longer.  If it drips in a continuous stream, you can start making art.  Drizzle the syrup in patterns over a silicone mat or parchment paper and allow to cool, then carefully peel off.  Or, spray bowls and other (clean) objects with cooking spray and drizzle the syrup to create domes and other shapes.  Allow to cool to room temperature, then serve soon or store in an air tight container.  These will eventually soften and droop from humidity in the air.

Here is the recipe we use at PURE fudge&amp;copy; for our caramel.  We have experimented for a while now, and this one seems to work best in even the most humid weather.  Caramel is hard to make, it takes patience and practice.

Caramel likes fat, so use real butter, and use cream if you can afford it.  Milk is a good substitute but you have to use WHOLE milk, not skim or 2%. 

The other thing to remember is that you are CARAMELIZING the sugar, so you need a hot temperature once you get going.  Caramel will &quot;spit&quot; as it boils so wear long sleeves and use a long spoon to stir with. NEVER cook caramel naked... just a bad idea.

Temperature is a funny thing with caramel.  If you want a caramel sauce, cook it to about 230.  If you want a hard candy, cook it to about 255 - 260.  This recipe is for making our Artisan Caramel Apples, so it gets cooked to 248 exactly in the PURE fudge kitchens.  

When cool it is very firm but chewy, when it cools to about 180 degrees it is perfect for dipping.

=== Equipment ===
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Candy Thermometer
&lt;LI&gt;LARGE saucepan or pot
&lt;LI&gt;Long handled wooden spoon
&lt;LI&gt;High Temperature Spatula (to get all the caramel out of the pot)
&lt;/UL&gt;

=== Ingredients ===
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;1 stick of butter (1/4 pound - 110g)
&lt;LI&gt;2 cups (480g) of Pure Cane Sugar (always use Pure Cane Sugar)
&lt;LI&gt;1 1/2 cups (360ml) Heavy Cream OR Whole Milk (not skim or 2%)
&lt;LI&gt;1 Cup (240ml) Light Corn Syrup
&lt;LI&gt;1 - 2 teaspoons Vanilla
&lt;/UL&gt;


=== Directions ===
Use a large saucepan or pot,the liquid will boil up to about 3 times the amount of warm liquid, so use a large cooking vessel.

NEVER cover the pot with a lid. the moisture will turn it into taffy or destroy it.

All temperatures are Fahrenheit.

On a low heat

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Melt the butter&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;pour in the cream or milk&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
If you are using milk, heat on '''LOW''' for about 20 minutes so all the fats mix together, stirring occasionally.  Remember, better too low heat at this stage than too high.  If you scorch the milk or cream, you have to start over.

If you are using cream, you can just go right to the next step.

Next add

&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Corn Syrup&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;

Let this cook into the mix for about 5 minutes, stir about once a minute for 15 seconds.

Then add
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Sugar&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
Stir this in until completely dissolved.  Turn the heat up to medium at this point and continue to stir for about 5 minutes until you are certain the sugar is completely dissolved.  It should look milky but feel smooth when you are stirring it.


Turn the heat up to just below high on a gas range.  Stir for 30 seconds, every 2 minutes.  When the temperature reaches 248 degrees, take the pot and place the bottom of it in cold water to stop the mixture from continuing to cook.

Keep stirring the entire time it is cooling.  When it starts to thicken a little add
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Vanilla&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;

One teaspoon is fine, if you really like vanilla, you can add up to 2 teaspoons.  Remember, vanilla has a high alcohol content so don't add it when the mixture is really hot, or it will just all burn up and you wont get any of the flavor.

=== Finishing up ===
If you are making apples, you can go ahead and start dipping once the temperature reaches around 180.  Use clean refrigerated apples for a nice glaze.

I hope this works for you, I know it works for us and don't be afraid to play around with it a little either.  Just remember to keep the amounts of sugars and liquids and drys at about the same percentages.

Regards,

      <text xml:space="preserve">Water works/wick [[w:hydroponics|hydroponics]] systems are probably the most basic form of hydroponics kits available. The way they function is fairly simple to understand. The roots of the plants are constantly submerged under water and a pump is used with an airstone to provide aeration.

Water works systems do not provide proper aeration of the roots. To allow roots to breath, a pump must be used, usually an external one connected to an air line running into the reservoir. At the other end of the tube is an airstone that gently diffuse oxygen into the reservoir tank.

Water works usually utilize grow rocks, rockwool or a combination of both mediums to grow plants and keep them up-right and sturdy. Water works can be classified as a wick system because wick strips are generally placed in the planters (net pots) to pull nutrient from the reservoir to feed the upper root system. When you submerge the planter into the reservoir, the wick strip will transport water from the reservoir to feed the part of the roots that is not submerged under water or the roots growing at the top level of the root system. 

[image:[http://www.hydroponicsearch.com/images/stories/homemade/water_works.gif]]

Water works hydroponics systems, such as, [http://www.hydroponicsearch.com/Explore_the_Science_of_Hydroponics/Compact_hydroponics_kits/Emilys_Garden_Kit/ Emily's Garden kit] is a good choice for beginners and hobby gardeners'. The system is easy to use and maintain. Simply fill the reservoir with nutrient solution, plug in pump and you're all set. The only thing you need to do periodically is replenish the reservoir once the nutrient solution falls below the water lever indicator.



== Compartments ==

1. Planters/Net Pots - The planters will house the base of the plants for structural support&lt;br&gt;
2. Reservoir - Contains the [[w:nutrient|nutrient]] solution&lt;br&gt;
3. External pump - Facilitate [http://www.hydroponicsearch.com/Explore_the_Science_of_Hydroponics/Aeration%3A_Nutrient_solution_%26_grow_media/Oxygenation%3A_diffusing_oxygen_in_nutrient_solution_and_grow_media/ aeration] of root system&lt;br&gt;
4. Tubing - Connects to [[w:pump|pump]] and [[w:airstone|airstone]] to aerate root system&lt;br&gt;
5. Airstones - Gently aerate the root system (Oxygen Diffuser)&lt;br&gt;
6. [[w:Wick|Wick]]s - Transport water from [[w:reservoir|reservoir]] to feed upper root system that is not submerged under water using capillary action



== Additional notes: ==

Water works hydroponics systems are not the most advanced, however, it will get the job done and the system is great for beginners and hobby Gardeners. Water works may cause root rot and other problems because the roots are in water for longer than they need to be and is not recommended for large or long term plants. 

Submerging plant roots into water for a long period of time will usually kill the plant or slows growth. Air stones will aerate the roots, but some plants may still die because of soaking up too much water.

One of the few crops that would be &quot;perfect&quot; for water works hydroponics systems is [[w:lettuce|lettuce]]. Lettuce is a crop that loves water and plenty of it. Lettuce growers should have great results using this hydroponics technique.



== Build your own ==

Building your own water works system is quite simple and can be fun, if you know how to follow instructions :-). This type of system would be best used for water loving plants such as lettuce.

Only a few items are required to get you up and running in no time. The things you will need to build a water works hydroponics system are listed below with illustrations for visual reference.



== Required items ==

1. External pump &lt;br&gt;
2. Airline/tubing&lt;br&gt;
3. Airstones&lt;br&gt;
4. Water proof [[w:bin|bin]], [[w:bucket|bucket]], [[w:fish tank|fish tank]] to use as a [[w:reservoir|reservoir]]&lt;br&gt;
5. StyroFoam&lt;br&gt;
6. Mesh Pots&lt;br&gt;
7. Growing medium - [[w:Rockwool|Rockwool]], Grow rocks, et&lt;br&gt;
8. Hydroponics nutrients - (Grow fertilizers, Bloom fertilizers, Supplements, pH)&lt;br&gt;
11. Julio

== Required tools ==

1. Black [[w:spray paint|spray paint]], paint - * Only required if reservoir is transparent&lt;br&gt;
2. Sharp object - Knife, box cutter, scissors (This is not a task for minors - Get help from an adult)



== Getting started ==
 
1. Find a container to use as a reservoir such as a fish tank or a bin/bucket of some sort. The reservoir should be painted black if it is not light proof. Allowing light to enter the reservoir will promote the growth of algae. It is a good idea to use a reservoir that is the same dimensions (length x width) from top to bottom (Example: Top: 36&quot;x20&quot; Bottom: 36&quot;x20&quot;). 

If possible, use a fish tank or similar container as your reservoir. Spray paint tank (if translucent) to black and let dry. Using a knife or other sharp object, score a vertical line on the side of the tank -- i.e. scratch off some paint in a straight line from top to bottom. This will be your water level meter; it will allow you to see how much water is in reservoir. Creating this line, however, is not necessary as you can determine how much water is in the reservoir simply by see how far down the floater (StyroFoam) has sunk. Adding the line gives a more accurate and convenient view of the nutrient solution level.


2. Use a tape measure to get the length and width of your reservoir. Measure from inside of the reservoir from one end to the other. Once you have the dimensions, cut the StyroFoam 1/4&quot; (inch) smaller than the size of the reservoir. For example, if your dimensions are 36&quot; in length and 20&quot; in width you should cut the StyroFoam to 35 3/4&quot; x 19 3/4&quot;. The StyroFoam should fix nicely, with just enough room to adjust to water level changes. 

lf the reservoir tapers off at the bottom (the bottom is smaller in dimension than the top) the floater (StyroFoam) should be 2&quot;-4&quot; smaller than the reservoir, or more if necessary.


3. Do not place StyroFoam in reservoir yet! First, you need to cut the holes for the net pots. Put the net pots on the StyroFoam where you want to place each plant. Using a pen or pencil, trace around the bottom of the net pots. Use a sharp tool such as a knife or box cutter to follow the trace lines and cut the holes for pots. (KIDS!!! Get help from an adult). On one end of the StyroFoam (any end), cut a small hole for the air line to run into the reservoir. 


4. The amount of plants you can grow will depend on the size of the garden you build and the types of crops you grow. Remember to space plants appropriately so the each receive ample amounts of light. 


5. The pump you choose must be strong enough to provide enough oxygen to sustain plants. Ask for a help choosing a pump at your local hydroponics supply store. Telling them the size of your reservoir (In gallons - 2, 5, 10 gallons, etc) and they should be able to make a recommendation.

Connect the air line to the pump and attach the air stone to the free end. The air line should be long enough to travel from the pump into the bottom of the reservoir or at least float in the middle some where so the oxygen bubbles can get to the roots. It also must be the right size for the pump you choose. Most pumps will come with the correct size air line. To make your best guest, use a one gallon bucked/bottle or any container that you know the capacity and fill the reservoir. Remember to count how much it takes to fill the reservoir and you will know the capacity of your reservoir.

== Setting it up ==

a. Fill reservoir with nutrient solution&lt;br&gt;
b. Place the StyroFoam in tank&lt;br&gt;
c. Run the air line through the designated hole/notch.&lt;br&gt;
d. Fill the net pots with growing medium and place one plant in each pot.&lt;br&gt;
e. Put the net pots into the designated holes in StyroFoam. &lt;br&gt;
f. Turn on/plug-in pump and start growing with your fully functional, homemade hydroponics system.&lt;br&gt;

 

== Artificial lighting ==

If your hydroponics system is for indoor use, you will need to provide artificial lighting for plants to thrive. The size of your garden will determine how much light fixtures and watts you will need for proper coverage. Lighting stores can provide more information on selecting lights. When plants are in growth phase, they benefit more from HID (High Intensity Discharge) lamps. In Bloom, HPS (High Pressure Sodium) increases yield and grow denser, heavier flowers.

Fluorescent light is also an option. However, fluorescent lamps does not offer the same amount of lumens as HID's or HPS lamps. Fluorescent are good for starters and seedlings and for growers with ventilation problems. Fluorescent also burns much cooler than HID's and HPS lamps allowing you to place plants closer to the light source without burning tender foliage.



== Footnotes: ==

A homemade hydroponics system like this is not ideal for a large scale production or commercial usage. This particular system plan does not offer a way to conveniently change nutrient solution. An extra container would be required to hold the floater while you change the solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Subversion (software)}}
Subversion (SVN) is a version control system initiated in 2000 by CollabNet Inc. It helps you to track the history of file and directory changes over time. Generally a Subversion repository is used by a community of  people. A repository is a centralized data storage, and people usually perform their changes locally, and then publish ('check in' or 'commit', all are synonyms for this process) them to the repository. So, what they have on their local machines is a '''Working Copy''' - a copy of a repository subtree (or maybe the whole tree):
[[Image: tree.png|center|Working Copy Sample]]

== Mechanism ==
The subversion mechanism is different from the mechanism of CVS, its well-known predecessor. Let's see how successive commits are archived on the server :


First, a user imports the files and the repertories on the server. All the files and repertories are at release (or revision) 1.
[[Image:Subversion 3d diagram first commit.svg|center|First commit]]


Then a user commit some changes. Only files fil1 and fil3 contain modifications so only these items are committed. The both are committed at the revision 2. If we want to retrieve all the files to the last revision, we will have files to the revision 2 or the last previous revision (i.e. 1)  if not exist.
[[Image:Subversion 3d diagram second commit.svg|center|Second commit]]


For the commit of the release 3, only the files fil3 and fil4 have changes. Note that the file fil4 has no revision 2.
[[Image:Subversion 3d diagram third commit.svg|center|Third commit]]


The files fil2 and fil3 are committed.
[[Image:Subversion 3d diagram fourth commit.svg|center|Fourth commit]]


One file has been added : fil5. There is no version of this file until the release 5.
[[Image:Subversion 3d diagram fifth commit.svg|center|Fifth commit]]


One repertory has been added : rep5.
[[Image:Subversion 3d diagram sixth commit.svg|center|Sixth commit]]


When a user updates her/his local files to an old release (for instance release 4), subversion will send each file or repertory at the release 4 or the last previous one if not exist.
[[Image:Subversion 3d diagram update to revision 4.svg|center|An update to an old revision]]

== How do we use Subversion with JavaSVN ==
So, there's a server-side storage of versioned data called repository, and there're clients who access that repository. And JavaSVN is:
* A client-side library.
* It provides APIs for both local operations that don't need a repository and concern only a Working Copy, and for direct working with a repository.
* At the same time the latest version of JavaSVN provides some extra features: it can create local repositories, replicate (copy in filesystem) existing ones, etc.
* It's quite flexible to configure.

Unfortunately, the Working Copy (WC) format limits users to operating only on files and directories. JavaSVN helps to workaround this limitation, it provides two different-level engines: a high-level one which is intended for operating on Working Copies (like '''svn.exe'''), and a low-level one which is a Subversion protocol implementation.
Both provide corresponding APIs. The low-level engine is actually a driver used for direct working with a Subversion repository, and the high-level engine uses that low-level one when an operation really needs to access a repository.

== Common Tasks ==
=== Rollback to a Previous Revision ===
    alias revertfile='read revertfile?&quot;What file do you want to revert?&quot;'
    alias revertrev='read revertrev?&quot;What revision do you want to revert to?&quot;'
    alias svnrevert='revertfile; revertrev; svn up $revertfile -r$revertrev; mv $revertfile foo; svn up; mv foo $revertfile;'

== Low-level Engine ==
As said above, the low-level engine is a protocol-specific driver used for immediate working with a repository. And the high-level engine could possibly be not the only one who uses such drivers, it's just a standard scenario. For example, there may be developers who operate with abstractions much different from just files and directories. And they would also like to keep their objects under version control, but how? A standard way of using a Working Copy is not suitable here, as it's based on trees of directories and files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Whatever your game or sport, there's a good chance that increasing your vertical jump will improve your game. Having a good vertical jump is very useful in almost every sport today because more and more athletes are spending more time in the air. Here are a few exercises that helped me increase my vertical by six inches. I went from barely grabbing the rim, to being able to dunk with one hand off of the dribble and catching alley hoops with two hands. 

==Exercises==

#Find a place where there are a lot of stairs and run them until your legs burn. Find a certain number of repetitions that are challenging and gradually increase them over time. This will also help with your conditioning. 
#Stack those aerobics boxes and platform things against a wall for support. Start with light weights (5 lb.) and then jump with your right foot facing the box and then jump off. Then alternate with your left foot, then two feet. Repeat for another repetition starting with your right foot again. Then start the entire process over only this time you jump sideways onto the box. This will help your vertical jump even more because it hits your muscles from a different angle. 
#Jump rope for quickness and explosion

==Tips==

You do not have to use heavy weights. In fact, they will increase your risk of getting injured.(do not exceed 10 lb.) When you land, make sure you are balanced and there is a slight bend at your knee.

This is a guide on circumventing the Vodaphone 3G Datacard paradox, After reading this guide I am confident you will beable to have a direct access remotely to a that is machine connected to the 3G datacard (via vpn), 

Lets begin... At the core of it, you find two problems
firstly vodaphones configuration of the ISP, is setup to transparently Nat your connection out of over a local network with just a couple of external ip address's, the result of that is, you can not have any tcp connection forwarded internally, and the second issue is the total non-exsistance of udp connectivity, resulting in a catastrophic failure of inbound connectivity over all, even special software designed to traverse firefalls will have no connectivity, as there dependent on udp capability.

The solution that is available:

(SUMARY)

You may of herd of a software called LoopHole available for linux and windows this purpose of this  program is basically to use the fully fletched connectivity of a remote host/server, or just one that has less impeeded/stunted connectivity, to circumvent the scenario of a machine with limited connectivity such as a machine with a vodaphone/3G datacard connection.. described above, LoopHole does this by routeing packets to and from the the machine with no connectivity to the machine with un-impeeded connectivity (the server), this is done by weird prioprietry software services that run in the background and methods, and is not free, and consumes resources inside &quot;the server&quot;, leaving you with an overhead you didn't need in the first place.
 

The FREE solution we will use here involves creating a PP2P/L2TP vpn tunnel to the server machine and simply enabling it a basic forwarding IP router all taffic is routed through the VPN tunnels gateway rather then the this will act as our own &quot;Loophole&quot;.

Requirements: 
Static IP arrangement, is required for the server to have a &quot;default gateway&quot; value for the vpn server.
Ip Forwarding / Router capabilitys.
Router capable of forwarding ports 1729 TCP and, GRE traffic on port 43.

For Windows XP Professional (no other versions tested at present)

this guide is incomplete.

== Online Safety Intro ==
As most of you know being on-line is not always where you’re safe. There are people who will try to take your identity, credit card number, e-mail anything else. Those people (if caught) get charged for Identity Theft, Fraud Theft, or some other thing they’ve done that there not suppose to. So that is why I’m here to tell you ways to be protected from the Internet.

Top 5 Things You Should Never Give Away
• Credit Card Number
• Phone Number
• E-Mail Address
• IP Address
• Images of you

Credit Card Number/Licenses Plate Number: Why? Simple, people could use your number to gain entrance to your money. There for they could use your credit card number they’ve acquired and use it on items they want to buy. Pretty soon you’ll start losing money because someone out there is using your credit card number, and you didn’t want to buy these things.

As for the Licenses Plate Number people could sue you for a car related thing (that is bad) you’ve never done. But there is a catch, you MUST have a Licenses Plate on your car, because the Cops will stop you if don’t. Why? Because the police will need that number if you, yourself have done something bad. It’s their job to bring justice to the roads. They block Licenses Plates in the show Cops if your ever wondering how it looks like to look at a protected car.

Phone Number: Why? People then could call you instantly and never stop. People could call you can bug you and that can get pretty annoying sometimes. Admit it, you don’t want someone stranger talking to you about candy in 5:00 Am do you? Only give out your phone number to the people you want to speak to or if they need to speak to you they’ll probably e-mail you why they want your phone number and you can call them.

E-Mail Address: It’s easy to understand why this wouldn’t be given out to anyone. With your e-mail address at someone’s hand they could e-mail you junk mail, viruses, Trojans, or something you may find annoying. Doing that if someone were to send you a virus you could actually think it’d be your long lost friend, cause you only give your E-mail to people you know. Then click the attachment. OH NO! It’s actually a virus! Only give out your e-mail to the people you trust.

IP Address: Yes, it’s true. If people know your IP Address you can get hacked. Yes, there are sites where you can download hacking programs. In my opinion the Government should ban those kinds of sites. Once people get a hold of your IP Address they can easily get any password they desire. Then they could go into your accounts and say bad things in your name, people believing it was actually you.

Images of you: Posting a picture of you in it can be dangerous. As for people can do many things with it? Post it on the web; modify it (making you look ugly), and some other things. Why do you think they block out faces in shows? They’re protecting the privacy of that person.

== Other Things You Should Know ==

If you’re at a Web Site. Read their Privacy Policy to expect what you’re getting yourself into, if you are submitting anything. But just incase read it.

At any time when a web site asks for your e-mail address or any personal info, make sure you know why they want that information. If a web site has a “About us” page read it first so you know whom your giving your E-mail address to.

If a website is new to you. Ask yourself this. Is this a good site? Does this site have good reputation? Have I ever heard of this site?

If the answer on the last question, Have I ever heard of this site? Is no. Then that site is probably bad. If you can’t find it in any search engines or if you find that site strange, ask a parent before submitting any work.

Keep your Identity a secret. Like if your name was Bob use Bob3846. So people won’t know it’s the real you. So before you go onto a site try to stay anonymous. Then once you make friends, know the site real good, and there are no creeps on log onto to that site you can change your name.

This legendary rule you should know by now. Don’t talk to strangers. Unless you want to. Like in most cases they will probably ask you to meet face-to-face. Also in most cases they strangers will probably be males. But not always. So if e-mail showed at your Inbox with an address you don’t know don’t click it. Instead, delete it.

Now the next few parts you’re going to read may not have anything to do with Online Safety but I’ll put it there. It’s Internet History. Why? Without this you wouldn’t be reading this!

== Intro ==

Large groups of computer called Servers, connect to one another. The home computer (PC) connects to these servers using a modem, joining a Network. 14 Years… it took for Internet to work properly. Or so they say, as the Internet is still having some problems.

== History ==

February 1969: Two guys called Kenneth Thompson &amp; Dennis Ritchie created a software program called UNIX. UNIX allowed people to communicate to one another. That was the start of the Internet.

September 1969: In this time four computers were set up at ARPANet to communicate. It failed while trying to send the word “Log”. At letter g the system crashed.

April 1972: First E-mail letter sent. The word and Electronic-Mail (e-mail) was born!

December 1973: Language called transmission control protocol/internet protocol was developed so computers at ARPANet could communicate with one another faster.

February 1974: The very first mouse to go across a mouse pad.

January 1975: Bill Gates dropped out of college to write the first basic computer language for the first working computer, Altair.

March 1975: The first version of ARPANet was released.

April 1975: Two guys named Bill Gates &amp; Paul Allen found Microsoft.

March 1976: Apple computer gets started as Steve Jobs &amp; Steve Wozniak develop Apple 1 Computer.

March 1977: There are one hundred computers online!

August 1981: The IBMPC is invented, that contained an operating system called MSDOS. Made by Bill Gates and developed by Tim Paterson.

December 1983: Internet connection was established, so a real life Internet was running. Used by research and military things related.

October 1984: The Apple Company makes a computer that is now called the Macintosh (Mac).

April 1987: The first computer virus made it’s way across the servers making the whole entire network to shut down for 24 hours.

April 1989: America Online (AOL), Prodigy, and CompuServe were the first sites to give everyone free Internet connection.

May 1990: HyperTextTerminalProtcol (HTTP) was written. Creating a big universe of search and displaying!

January 1992: Switzerland’s company C.E.R.N created the World Wide Web. Numbers of servers makes it to 1,236,000!
January 1994: The White House website is published and released for us to see!

February 1994: Pizza Hut takes the first ever-online order!

April 1994: Two guys named Jerry Yang and David Filo created Yahoo!.

May 1995: Java was invented by micro systems.

July 1995: Amazon.com, virtual bookstore, is created.

January 1997: Browser war between Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape sparks!

August 1998: Steve Jobs goes back to Apple computers and created the iMac.

November 1998: AOL buys Netscape for $4.2 Billion.

June 1999: The Internet reaches 56,218,000 connected computers!

If you have a important date I left out please restate it like I did. I will add credits! wink.gif

Internet Viruses can be deadly, but some do practically nothing but scare you into really affecting your computer. Here are lists of viruses.

Virus can get onto your computers by E-Mail attachments, Downloading programs, File sharing, and CD Sharing. But anytime your computer gets data a virus might be hidden inside! Like a biological virus a virus can replicate its self, and then looks for other computers to feast on.

== Small Timeline ==

1981: A virus makes its way across Apple users in Texas A&amp;M University.

1991: The Tequila virus becomes the first shape shifting to infect computers in the world.

1992: The first virus kit becomes available to users around the Internet.

2002: David Smith, creator of the Melissa Virus is sentenced to 20 months in Federal Prison.

== Software Viruses ==

Software Virus hide in programs in your computer. Waiting for you to click on that folder that they are hiding in.

E-Mail Viruses are the most common. What happens is that if you click the attachment, sometimes the virus will mail itself to everyone in your address book and will hide in hyperlinks. The person’s friend who got infected clicks it and they get a virus too! Usually some smart friends delete it and warn everyone on their friend list.

Computer Worms are very damaging. A worm is a program that searches for security holes in networks. When a worm finds a computer that is safe for that worm to go in. It copies itself into that computer, and then it looks for other computers in that computers network.

Trojan Horse will erase your hardrive in your computer. All your files, programs, downloads will be gone. Trojan horses are disguised as something good like game downloads or something.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''jump start''' is a colloquial term for a method of starting an automobile or other internal combustion engine-powered vehicle having a discharged battery.

Most U.S. passenger vehicles use a standard 12-volt direct current (DC) Lead-acid battery which, when the driver turns the ignition key, an electric motor engages the teeth on the flywheel, briefly turning the flywheel which is connected to the crankshaft and powers the spark plugs until ignition is achieved and the engine can produce its own electrical power from its generator or alternator.

When a battery fails or is discharged, such as by inadvertently leaving one's headlights switched on while parked, the car's engine will not &quot;turn over&quot; when the ignition key is turned.  Many motorists carry &quot;jumper cables&quot; which consist of a pair of heavy gauge wires with large crocodile clips at each end.

Good quality jumper cables will have large copper conductors, well-made alligator clips, and insulation which remains flexible at low temperatures. Longer cables require less maneuvering of the boosting vehicle to allow connection of the two batteries.

== Detailed Procedure ==

===Preparation and cautions===
If the discharged battery is cracked, has a low [[:w:Electrolyte|electrolyte]] level, or is frozen, a jump start should not be attempted. Corroded terminals will increase the voltage drop during cranking and will contribute to starting difficulty.  Proper jump start procedures are usually found in the vehicle owner's manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=2004 Owner's Manual,`Toyota Camry Solara, Toyota Publication No. OM33596U, an example of an owner's manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://new.volvocars.com/ownersdocs/1986/1986_240/86240_03b.htm On-line version of a 1986 Volvo 240 owner's manaul, page 64, shows jump start procedure &lt;/ref&gt; Owner's manuals may show the preferred locations for connection of jumper cables; for example, some vehicles have the battery mounted under a seat or a jumper terminal in the engine compartment.

Motorists can be severely injured by a battery explosion. In the United States in 1994, a research note by the National Highway Traffic Safety Association estimated that about 442 persons were injured by exploding batteries while attempting a jump-start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Injuries Associated with Hazards Involving Motor Vehicle Batteries|publisher=''Road Management and Engineering Journal'' and TranSafety|url=http://www.usroads.com/journals/rmej/9808/rm980801.htm|accessdate=August 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as Prevent Blindness America recommend use of splash-resistant safety goggles to protect the eyes while connecting cables.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citation |url=http://www.preventblindness.org/safety/battery.html|title=Prevent Blindness|publisher=Prevent Blindness|accessdate=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation of a lead-acid battery produces [[:w:Hydrogen|hydrogen gas]], which is flammable. Caution is needed to avoid a spark that may ignite the gas.   The recommended sequence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Horst|last=Bauer|title=Bosch Automotive Handbook 4th Edition|publisher=Robert Bosch GmbH|location=Stuttgart|year=1996|isbn=0-8376-0333-1|pages=806-807}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to first  connect the positive terminals of both batteries, then connect the negative post of the charged battery and make the last connection to the frame of the vehicle with the dead battery, at a location away from the battery.  By not connecting the last clamp on to the dead battery, the risk of ignition is reduced. The described sequence of connections is intended to reduce the chance of accidentally shorting the good battery. 

Current from the boosting vehicle will charge the dead battery. After several minutes enough energy is transferred to allow cranking of the engine.&lt;ref&gt;Hybrid vehicles have slightly different power requirements, there is no need to 'crank the engine' for instance. The donor vehicle only has to supply enough power to start the hybrid system. [[Automobile Repair/Toyota/Prius]] for example.&lt;/ref&gt; If the connections are good and the cables are large, the boosting vehicle battery may also supply part of the cranking current. In an extreme case, it is possible to crank and start a vehicle with no battery in it if the cables are heavy-duty. Cranking current drawn through light-gauge cables will damage them by overheating. 

A jump start is only effective for a discharged battery and cannot resolve other faults including a lack of fuel, a failed battery, or other mechanical problems. Even after a successful jump start a vehicle may not be able to resume normal operation if the reason for the dead battery is a failed charging system. Unless the cause of the battery discharge is known, the operator of the boosted vehicle should have the battery and charging system checked.

Loss of voltage from the vehicle battery may have wide-ranging effects--from a trivial loss of radio receiver preset stations to a significant loss of security codes or engine control parameters. A prudent motorist should familiarize himself with the effects of a dead battery; booster cables may be unavailable if the [[:w:Remote keyless system|keyless entry system]] won't unlock the trunk (boot).

===How to===
An automobile with a good battery is parked near the car needing the jump start and the cables are attached in this order:

* One cable attaches to the positive (+, red) terminal of the dead battery, and then to the positive terminal of the live battery.
* The other cable attaches to the negative (-, black) terminal of the live battery, and then to the engine block of the car with the dead battery.

[[Image:Jumper Cable-1.jpg|thumb|A &quot;safety&quot; jumper cable, in two pieces. The red and black leads of each piece are connected to a car's battery, and then the yellow connectors are plugged together.]]

With a safety cable, such as the one shown in the picture, the two pieces are connected together. The safety cable has colour coded crocodile clips and the connectors are polarised so that they can only be inserted in the correct orientation.

Since the entire engine block is grounded to the negative terminal, the cable need not be connected directly to the dead battery's negative terminal, and in fact it would be unwise to do so as sparks from the connection (when the circuit is completed) could ignite the battery. (Highly flammable hydrogen gas can be given off by a battery, though this is less of a risk with the completely sealed &quot;maintenance-free&quot; batteries unless their case is compromised). A good connection point would be a piece of unpainted metal at least eighteen inches away from the dead battery. Some engines have eyelets which are used to attach chains when the engine needs to be lifted out of the car; these make good connection points for the jumper cable.

* If two cables are used that are completely detached from each other, then the grounds of the two vehicles should be connected first using one of the cables, while keeping the other cable out of the way. Then, using the other cable, the positive connection should be made. Once one end of the positive connection is made, that jumper cable is &quot;live&quot; and must not be allowed to touch anything other than its intended positive connection point in the other vehicle. To further reduce the risk of spark around the dead battery, each connection should be made in the stranded vehicle first, and then in the running vehicle. (Even when the grounds are being connected together, and there isn't a complete circuit, there could be an electrical potential difference between the cars, the discharge of which could cause a spark. This is one reason why grounds are connected first, if possible, otherwise such a discharge may later choose a path through the electrical components). It is a basic electrical principle that ground connections are made first and broken last, unless there is a good reason to do otherwise, as described next.

* If the two jumper cables are attached together, as is often the case, then the opposite procedure is followed: the positive connection must be completed first, and then the grounding connection. The reason for this reversal is that because the cables are joined, when one clip is fastened, the opposite one is left dangling near it, unless an assistant holds it up. The dangling clip is likely to touch something that is grounded, like the chassis or engine block. Therefore, the clip that is left dangling should be the negative one which is intended to be grounded anyway. If, incorrectly, the negative clip is connected, while the positive one, left dangling, touches something that is grounded, an instant short circuit will result when the corresponding positive connection is later made at the opposite end. For the same reason, it is also important not to connect both clips on one end first to one car, because then the clips on the opposite end of the cable may touch, causing a short circuit.

* If a safety cable is used, such as the one shown in the picture, then the alligator clips of the two separate cable components are attached in whatever order is convenient. Then the plug-and-socket connection is made to bridge them together.

* Later, after the jump start is complete, the connections should be detached in exactly the reverse order of their attachment. In the case of the safety cable, the socket connection between the two cable sections is unplugged first and then the clips are removed.

(Many auto manufacturers specify methods of jump-starting their cars, such as a different sequence of attaching or detaching jumper cables. For your safety, please read your owner's manual!)

The &quot;good&quot; car is then started, and the dead battery is allowed to charge for a few minutes. Then the car with the dead battery can be started, the cables carefully detached, and the formerly-stranded motorist goes on his or her way. If the original cause of the dead battery was simply a drain such as the headlights being left on overnight, then the car's generator should take care of finishing the recharge and keeping the battery charged; but if the battery is damaged or old or there is some problem with the car's electrical system, then the motorist should keep his engine running until he can buy a new battery or reach a service station.

Note that unlike a battery charger, a car's alternator lacks the current-limiting circuit needed for the proper trickle-charging of deeply discharged batteries, and should not be used for that purpose. Charging a battery at too high a current is not good for either the alternator, or the battery.

In localities or situations lacking in Good Samaritans, there is always the auto club, for its members. Roadside assistance vehicles, dispatched by them or not, can be expected to carry equipment at least as handy as a self-contained and portable jump-start unit consisting of a battery and two leads to connect it to the stopped car's starter circuit, substituting for the dead battery.

==Step-by-Step Guide==
# Clamp one cable to the positive (+) terminal of the dead battery. Don't let the positive cable touch anything metal other than the battery terminals.
# Connect the other end of the positive cable to the positive terminal of the good battery.
# Connect one end of the negative (-) cable to the negative terminal of the good battery.
# Connect the other end of the negative cable to metal on the engine block on the car with the dead battery. Don't connect it to the dead battery, carburetor, fuel lines or moving parts.
# Stand back and start the car with the good battery.
# Start the stalled car.
# Remove the cables in reverse order.

==Alternatives to jumper cables==
===Cigarette lighter outlet===
An alternative to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlet) of two vehicles.  While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, the amount of current available through such a connection is small. This method works through very slowly charging the battery, not through providing the current needed for cranking. Engine cranking should not be attempted as the starter motor current will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Not all vehicle cigarette lighter outlets remain on while the ignition is turned off,&lt;ref&gt; For example, http://www.vat19.com/dvds/auto-jumper-jumpstarts-car-without-cables.cfm, one maker of a cigarette lighter booster, says it won't work if the car switches off its cigarette lighter with the engine off. &lt;/ref&gt; making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory position to connect the cigarette lighter outlet to the battery.

=== Battery booster and jump starter ===
A hand-portable battery, equipped with attached cables and charger, can be used similarly to another vehicle's battery (it is called a battery booster and jump starter).  It can reach 1700 peak amps. 

Portable boosters may automatically sense the battery's polarity prior to sending power to the vehicle, eliminating the costly damage that can result from a simple jump-starting mistake.

===Battery charger===
Motorists and service garages often have portable [[:w:Battery charger|battery chargers]] operated from [[:w:Mains electricity|AC power]].  Very small &quot;trickle&quot; chargers are intended only to maintain a charge on a parked or stored  vehicle, but larger chargers can put enough charge into a battery to allow a start within a few minutes. Battery chargers may be strictly  manual, or may include controls for time and charging voltage.  Some chargers are equipped with &quot;boost&quot; settings that allow source of a large amount of current to assist in cranking the engine.  Battery chargers that apply high voltage (for example, more than 16 volts on a 12 volt nominal system) will result in high emission of hydrogen gas from the battery and may damage it.  A battery may be recharged without removal from the vehicle, although in a typical roadside situation no convenient source of AC power may be nearby.

===Push starting===

A vehicle with a manual transmission may be [[:w:push start|push started]].  This requires caution while pushing the vehicle and may require the assistance of several persons. If the vehicle battery cannot provide power to the ignition system, push starting will be ineffective. Most vehicles with [[:w:Automatic_transmission|automatic transmissions]] cannot be started this way because the hydraulic [[:w:Torque converter|torque converter]] in the transmission will not allow the engine to be driven by the wheels (some very old automatic transmissions, e.g., General Motors' two-speed Powerglide transmission, do leave a solid connection between the engine and wheels, and cars equipped with such transmissions can be push started).

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]]
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chillies]], chopped
* [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chillies]], whole
* [[Cookbook:Mint|mint leaves]], chopped
* [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]], both powder and whole spices
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] and [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] paste
* [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]
* [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]]
* [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]

==Procedure==

# Marinate chicken with fried onions (should be red and just crush it with hand, don't blend), yoghurt (put a lot of yoghurt and onions if you want a lot of masala), chopped green peppers (don't use [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|red mirchi powder]], the taste won't be the same), chopped mint leaves, ghee, garam masala powder, salt, ginger garlic paste. Leave this to marinate at least 4-5 hours if it's chicken, and 12 hours if it's [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] or [[Cookbook:Goat|goat]].
# Meanwhile prepare for the rice by putting all these ingredients out, because the rice gets ruined if you start looking for everything while doing the ... mix food color or zaafran (saffron) in milk, chop coriander leaves, a few green peppers (whole, don't chop), garam masala powder, fried onions, butter or ghee, lemon juice.
# Boil water, when it starts getting hot, put whole garam masala (long, big ilaichi - the black one, kala zeera ([[Cookbook:Black Cumin|black cumin]]), whole [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon sticks]]) and a little bit of oil so that the rice grains don't stick to each other (something I learned from my mommy) and salt... when the water comes to boil, put the rice in and boil slightly (I keep the mark by checking the rice and I strain it when the rice grain gets 3-4 lines on 'em LOL... cook it a lot less than you normally would for regular [[Cookbook:Biryani|biryani]] because it has to cook more with the chicken...)
# Once you strain the rice, leave a thin layer of rice on the bottom of the pot because the chicken/meat tends to stick, so if there's rice on the bottom, that'll stick, not the meat.
# Dump the marinated chicken in the pateela, and cover the chicken with rice. 
# Cut the butter stick into 4 pieces and put each piece in a different part of the pot. 
# Pour the lemon juice over the rice, I like to make a smilie face with the color/saffron milk sticking the green peppers in the rice as eyes LOL... 
# Then put the coriander, fried onions and sprinkle a bit of garam masala powder. 
# Cover the pot completely with foil and then the cover so that no steam gets out. Leave it on high heat for a while (maybe 10 mins) after that turn it to medium.
# If you have a burner, its better than an electric stove because the heat gets everywhere; but to be on the safe side, rotate the pot every 10 mins so that the meat cooks evenly. 
# After about 30-35 mins, you'll smell the biryani because of immense steam coming out of the pot... you might want to check if the rice looks properly cooked... if so you can turn it off... if there's no steam coming out, then leave it a few minutes more...

This is a variety of dal, the common staple food of South Asia made with [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]] forming a stew or thick soup. Dal is the name for split [[Cookbook:Legume|legumes]] in many South Asian languages (see [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]] article). Khatti translates as sour from Hindi, and comes from the use of tamarind, a very sour fruit on its own. Serve with any variety of [[Cookbook:Roti|roti]] (a round flat bread) or over rice and with a vegetable preparation on the side and an achar (pickle) or chutney as condiments. The roti is used to scoop up the dal and grab pieces of the vegetable.

==Ingredients==

*[[Cookbook:Toor dal|Toor daal]] (split pigeon peas) -  1 cup (240ml)
*[[Cookbook:Oil|Oil]] -  2 tblsp
*[[Cookbook:Onion|Onion]]  -  1
*[[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger paste]]  - 1/2 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic paste]] - 1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Tomato|Tomato]] (diced or crushed) - 3 tblsp
*[[Cookbook:Tamarind|Tamarind]] -  6-8 pieces (not paste)
*[[Cookbook:Chili Powder|Red chilli powder]] -  1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]]  -  1/2 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard seeds]] - 1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin seeds]] (jeera) -  1 tsp
*[[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry leaves]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste
*[[Cookbook:Cilantro|Coriander leaves]] (cilantro) for garnish

==Procedure==

# Wash toor daal and boil it about 20 minutes until soft then smash it.
# In a kadai (rounded all purpose cooking bowl/frying pan), heat the oil till hot.  Add curry leaves, mustard seeds and jeera seeds.  Fry for a minute. They will pop at first, so a cover will help to avoid a mess.
# Add onion and fry till slightly brown. 
# Add ginger and garlic paste.  Fry for a minute.  Then add the tomatoes (paste or diced). Cook it till the oil separates.
# Add tamarind pieces (not paste).  Add turmeric powder and red chilli powder. Cook it for 4 to 5 mins.
# Add the toor daal and enough water per the thickness desired.
# Add salt to taste and garnish with coriander leaves.
# Serve with a roti (flat bread) or poured over rice.

'''Puri''', also '''Poori''' - an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]].

==Ingredients==

* 2oz / 60g [[Cookbook:Whole Wheat|whole-wheat flour]]
* 2oz / 60g [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|plain white flour]]
* 2 oz fine [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]]
* ¼ tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tbs [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]] for the dough
* about 500ml / a pint of vegetable oil for deep frying the pooris
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] to mix the dough

==Procedure==

===Dough Preparation===
# Put all the dry ingredients into a bowl. 
# Add salt and dribble the tbs. oil. 
# Mix well. Add water gradually to make it a stiff dough. 
# Knead well for a few minutes. 
# Cover the dough and leave to rest for about half an hour.

===Frying Puri===
# Pour the oil for deep frying in a wok and heat the oil. 
# Meanwhile divide the dough into 8 small balls and roll into small circle. (about 3&quot; [7.5cm] in diameter) 
# You can use a bit of hot oil to roll the dough so it will not stick to the surface. 
# When the oil is hot (test - if you put a tiny dough in the oil it should come up straight away), lay the flatted dough over the oil, press the top slightly with the slotted spoon until it inflates itself, and turn to other side. Adjust the flame as necessary. 
# If it sinks quickly to the bottom of the wok, the oil is not hot enough (puri will absorb too much oil). It should balloon within a few seconds. 
# Remove from oil after the puri turn golden/light brown color and place on a wire rack or kitchen paper towel for excess oil to drain.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* For chapattis dough, don't use semolina and plain flour. Only use whole meal flour, salt and oil.

* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Oil|cooking oil]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 or 2 teaspoons of [[Cookbook:Tamarind|tamarind paste]]
* Salt
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] ([[Cookbook:Jaggery|jaggery]] or [[Cookbook:Palm Sugar|palm sugar]] is good too)
* [[Cookbook:Water|water]] - the amount depends on the amount of Rasam required. It is meant to be very watery.

===Rasam Powder===
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander seeds]]
* 3 to 4 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|dried red chillies]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
* A small pinch of [[Cookbook:Asafoetida|asafoetida]]

To prepare Rasam powder: Fry the all the ingredients together, adding asafoetida last, in a pan with two teaspoons of oil or ghee. Roast  until the spices start to brown slightly, and powder the ingredients. (Coriander seed is very difficult to powder)

===Mustard Seed seasoning===
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] (or butter and oil) 
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Mustard|black mustard seeds]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Urad Dal|urad dhal]] ([[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]] may also be used)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|dried red chillies]]
* 4 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]
* A handful of chopped [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]] (cilantro)

==Procedure==

# Wash the toovar dhal thoroughly, until the water runs clear.
# Cover with double the quantity of water, turmeric powder and teaspoon of oil. Cook in a microwave for half an hour, a pressure cooker, or slowly on a stove, covered. The dhal should turn out a mushy consistency.
# Cut the tomatoes into four pieces, put them in a saucepan full of water and bring to the boil.
# Add tamarind, salt and teaspoon of sugar. The tamarind is usually very bitter, so add only a little at a time. Tamarind can be added later to adjust the flavour.
# When the tomatoes are half cooked add the cooked dal.
# Add enough Rasam powder to give the desired taste, usually 4 or 5 teaspoons. It should be reasonably spicy, and neither the tamarind or sugar should dominate. Stir and keep simmering.
# In a small pan, heat the ghee for the mustard seed seasoning and add the mustard seeds, urud dhal, chillies and curry leaves. The urud dhal should start to go brown and the mustard seeds will start spitting. Don't burn any of the spices - it's easy to do. Once cooked, pour the seasoning  into the rest of the rasam straight away and stir it through. 
# Add chopped coriander leaves. Serve with hot and soft plain boiled rice.

==Karnataka Style==
===Ingredients===

===Procedure===
# Pressure cook the dhal with sufficient water. 
# If using tomatoes for sourness, parboil first to remove skin and chop roughly. 
# To the cooked dhal, add salt, chilli powder, turmeric powder, and tomatoes or tamarind extract.
# Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes.
# Add the asafoetida, grated coconut, and ground coriander.
# Add any other spice as required (please list the optional spices or ingredients!)
# Simmer for a few minutes (to cook the coconut properly).
# In a separate frying pan, heat 3 tablespoon of oil over medium heat.
# Add the mustard seed and cumin seed.  
# When the mustard seeds pop, remove from the heat and add the curry leaves.
# Add to the Saaru.
# Garnish with coriander leaves.

Learn [[w:Uyghur language|Uyghur]]!

==Contents==
The central discussion point for the whole book should be [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}]].

===[[/Cover]]===
+ interwiki, cats
===[[/Introduction]]===
Introduction to the Uyghur language. For an introduction to this book, per se, see the '''[[/About]]''' section.
** [[/Introduction/Linguistic]]: In China, But Not Chinese (a survey of its linguistic features, cf. English), dialects
** [[/Introduction/History]]: lang development, literature, maps
** [[/Introduction/Culture]]: The Uyghur people, Xinjiang
** [[/Introduction/Why]]: Why should you learn Uyghur? What is the motivation behind this wikitextbook? 
** [[/Introduction/Resources]]: books, uni courses, websites (see below)

===[[/Basics]]===
[[Image:Learning Arabic calligraphy.jpg|200px|right]]
Emphasise the importance of making that quick association between the script and the sound. heaps of OGGs to listen to (not so many later). should master this section completely before going on to the next (remember how long you spent just learning the alphabet? gotta crawl before you can walk), but it should also serve as a &quot;drop-in refresher&quot; for later
** [[/Basics/Sounds]]: the basic sounds of Uyghur, IPA (OGGs), how to produce them
*** [[/Basics/Sounds/Vowels]]
*** [[/Basics/Sounds/Consonants]]
** [[/Basics/Scripts]]: Internet, fonts, Unicode? map between IPA, latin, arabic, (cyrillic?)
*** [[/Basics/Scripts/Arabic]]
**** how the hell do you parse Arabic script...?! tips for reading it
*** [[/Basics/Scripts/Cyrillic]]
*** [[/Basics/Scripts/Latin]]
** [[/Basics/Practice]]: nonsense phrases, tongue twisters, reading things you don't understand just to practice the sounds, maybe numbers and place names 
** [[/Basics/Phrases]]: Stock phrases

===[[/Lessons]]===
Each lesson should have, as a minimum:
** Introduction: In this lesson you will learn...
** Text(s) (mostly dialogue, may also include speeches/newspaper articles later)
** Vocabulary lists (from [[/Vocabulary]])

**huge number of affixes apparently. I suggest one per node/page. just spread everything out and make it all independent if possible, so people can dip in and out as they need.

===[[/Beyond]]===
** [[/Beyond/Standards]]: testing? create our own?
** [[/Beyond/Reuse]]: how to reuse this content (teach others! spread the word! translate into other wikibooks!)
** [[/Beyond/Maintenance]]: what you can do to maintain your language skills
** / [[w:ug:|ug.wp]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{R Programming/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

'''R''' includes at least three graphical systems, the standard '''graphics''' package, the '''lattice''' package for Trellis graphs&lt;ref name = &quot;sarkar&quot;&gt;D. Sarkar. Lattice: Multivariate Data Visualization with
R. Springer, 2008. ISBN 9780387759685.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''grammar-of-graphics'' '''ggplot2''' package&lt;ref name = &quot;wickham&quot;&gt;
''ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (Use R)'' by Hadley Wickham and a list of examples on his own website : http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/&lt;/ref&gt;. R has good graphical capabilities but there are some alternatives like [[w:gnuplot|gnuplot]].


== Interactive Graphics ==

This section discuss some ways to draw graphics without using R scripts. 

The '''playwith''' package provides a graphical user interface to customize the graphs, add a title, a grid, some text, etc and it exports the R code you need if you want to replicate the analysis&lt;ref name = &quot;playwith&quot;&gt;playwith : http://code.google.com/p/playwith/&lt;/ref&gt;. If you want to know more, you can have a look at the screenshots on the website ([http://code.google.com/p/playwith/wiki/Screenshots link]). See also the example on &quot;R you Ready&quot; [http://ryouready.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/playing-with-the-playwith-package/]. This package require GTK+ libraries. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
library(&quot;playwith&quot;)
playwith(plot(x1))
&lt;/source&gt;

There is also a graphical user interface '''GrapheR''' which makes it very easy to draw graphs for beginners&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last1=Hervé|first1=Maxime|year=2011|title=GrapheR: a Multiplatform GUI for Drawing Customizable Graphs in R|journal=The R Journal|publisher= |volume=3|issue=2|pages= |url=http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-2/RJournal_2011-2_Herve.pdf|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This solution is cross-platform.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; library(GrapheR)
&lt;/source&gt;

'''latticist''' ([http://code.google.com/p/latticist/ link]) is another similar project.

Note also that some graphical user interface such as RKward and R Commander makes it easy to draw graphs.

== Standard R graphs ==

In this section we present what you need to know if you want to customize your graphs in the default graph system.
* &lt;code&gt;plot()&lt;/code&gt; is the main function for graphics. The arguments can be a single point such as 0 or c(.3,.7), a single vector, a pair of vectors or many other R objects. 
* &lt;code&gt;par()&lt;/code&gt; is another important function which defines the default settings for plots. 
* There are many other plot functions which are specific to some tasks such as &lt;code&gt;hist()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;boxplot()&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Most of them take the same arguments as the &lt;code&gt;plot()&lt;/code&gt; function. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; N &lt;- 10^2
&gt; x1 &lt;- rnorm(N) 
&gt; x2 &lt;- 1 + x1 + rnorm(N)
&gt; plot(0) 
&gt; plot(0,1) 
&gt; plot(x1) 
&gt; plot(x1,x2) # scatter plot x1 on the horizontal axis and x2 on the vertical axis
&gt; plot(x2 ~ x1) # the same but using a formula (x2 as a function of x1)
&gt; methods(plot) # show all the available methods for plot (depending on the number of loaded packages).
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Titles, legends and annotations ===

==== Titles ====

&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; gives the main title, &lt;code&gt;sub&lt;/code&gt; the subtitle. They can be passed as argument of the &lt;code&gt;plot()&lt;/code&gt; function or using the &lt;code&gt;title()&lt;/code&gt; function. 
&lt;code&gt;xlab&lt;/code&gt; the name of the x axis and &lt;code&gt;ylab&lt;/code&gt; the name of the y axis.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
 plot(x1,x2, main = &quot;Main title&quot;, sub = &quot;sub title&quot; , ylab = &quot;Y axis&quot;, xlab = &quot;X axis&quot;)
 plot(x1,x2 ,  ylab = &quot;Y axis&quot;, xlab = &quot;X axis&quot;)
 title(main = &quot;Main title&quot;, sub = &quot;sub title&quot; )
&lt;/source&gt;

The size of the text can be modified using the parameters &lt;code&gt;cex.main&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cex.lab&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cex.sub&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cex.axis&lt;/code&gt;. Those parameters define a ''scaling factor'', ie the value of the parameter multiply the size of the text. If you choose &lt;code&gt;cex.main=2&lt;/code&gt; the main title will be twice as big as usual.

==== Legend ====

&lt;code&gt;legend()&lt;/code&gt;. The position can be &quot;bottomleft&quot;, &quot;bottomright&quot;, &quot;topleft&quot;, &quot;topright&quot; or exact coordinates.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, col = 1, lty = 1) 
lines(x2, col = 2, lty = 2) 
legend(&quot;bottomleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;x1&quot;,&quot;x2&quot;), col = 1:2, lty = 1:2)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Text in the margin ====

&lt;code&gt;mtext()&lt;/code&gt; puts some texts in the margin. The margin can be at the bottom (1), the left (2), the top (3) or the right (4). 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, col = 1, lty = 1) ; mtext(&quot;some text&quot;, side = 1) # the bottom
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, col = 1, lty = 1) ; mtext(&quot;some text&quot;, side = 2) # the left
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, col = 1, lty = 1) ; mtext(&quot;some text&quot;, side = 3) # the top
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, col = 1, lty = 1) ; mtext(&quot;some text&quot;, side = 4) # the right margin
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Text in the graph ====

&lt;code&gt;text()&lt;/code&gt;

==== Mathematical annotations ====

We can add mathematical symbols using &lt;code&gt;expression()&lt;/code&gt; and makes some substitution in a formula using &lt;code&gt;substitute()&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
?plotmath # gives help for mathematical annotations
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Types ===

The type of a plot can be :
* &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; for none (nothing is printed), 
* &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; for points, 
* &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt; for lines, 
* &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; for both, 
* &lt;code&gt;o&lt;/code&gt; for both overlayed, 
* &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; for histogram-like 
* and &lt;code&gt;s/S&lt;/code&gt; for steps.

&lt;/pre&gt; 
|| [[Image:Plottype.png|thumb|left|clic on the graph to zoom]]

=== Axes ===

The default output print the axes. We can remove them with &lt;code&gt;axes=FALSE&lt;/code&gt;. We can also change them using the &lt;code&gt;axis()&lt;/code&gt; function. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; plot(x1,x2,axes=FALSE)
&gt;
&gt; plot(x1,x2,axes=FALSE)
&gt; axis(1,col=&quot;red&quot;,col.axis=&quot;blue&quot;,font.axis=3)
&gt; axis(2,col=&quot;red&quot;,col.axis=&quot;blue&quot;,font.axis=2,las=2)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;las&lt;/code&gt; specifies the style of axis labels. It can be 0, 1, 2 or 3.
* 0 : always parallel to the axis [default],
* 1 : always horizontal,
* 2 : always perpendicular to the axis,
* 3 : always vertical.

plot(x1, las = 1, main = &quot;las = 1&quot;, sub = &quot;always horizontal&quot;, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;) 
plot(x1, las = 2, main = &quot;las = 2&quot;, sub = &quot;always perpendicular to the axis&quot;, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)
plot(x1, las = 3, main = &quot;las = 3&quot;, sub = &quot;always vertical&quot;, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt; 
|| [[Image:Rplotaxisstyle.png|thumb|left|clic on the graph]]
|}

It is also possible to add another y axis on the right by adding &lt;code&gt;axis(4,)&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Margins ===

{{...}}

Margins can be computed in inches or in lines. The default is &lt;code&gt;par(mar = c(5,4,4,2))&lt;/code&gt; which means that there are 5 lines at the bottom, 4 lines on the left, 4 lines in the top and 2 lines on the right. This can be modified using the &lt;code&gt;par()&lt;/code&gt; function. If you want to specify margins in inches, use &lt;code&gt;par(mai = c(bottom, left, top, right)&lt;/code&gt;. If you want to modify margins in lines, use &lt;code&gt;par(mar = c(bottom, left, top, right)&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;code&gt;?par&lt;/code&gt; to learn more about the topic.

=== Colors ===

The color of the points or lines can be changed using the &lt;code&gt;col&lt;/code&gt; argument, &lt;code&gt;fg&lt;/code&gt; for foreground colors (boxes and axes) and &lt;code&gt;bg&lt;/code&gt; for background colors.

* &lt;code&gt;show.col(object=NULL)&lt;/code&gt; ('''Hmisc''') package plots the main R colors with their numeric code. 
* The list of all colors in R ([http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf  pdf])

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
colors() # list the r colors
show.col(object=NULL) # graphs the main R colors
plot(x1, col = &quot;blue&quot;)
plot(x1, col = &quot;red&quot;)
plot(x1, col = &quot;red&quot;, col.axis = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, col.lab = &quot;firebrick&quot;, col.main = &quot;darkgreen&quot;, col.sub = &quot;cyan4&quot;, main = &quot;Testing colors&quot;, sub = &quot;sub titles&quot;, ylab = &quot;y axis&quot;, xlab = &quot;x axis&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

* We can also generate new colors using the &lt;code&gt;rgb()&lt;/code&gt; function. The first argument is the intensity of red, the second, the intensity of green and the third, the intensity of blue. They vary between 0 and 1 by default but this can be modified with the option &lt;code&gt;max = 255&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;col2rgb()&lt;/code&gt; returns the RGB code of R colors. &lt;code&gt;col2hex()&lt;/code&gt; ('''gplots''') gives the hexadecimal code. &lt;code&gt;col2grey()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;col2gray()&lt;/code&gt; ('''TeachingDemos''') converts colors to grey scale.
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; mycolor &lt;- rgb(.2,.4,.6)
&gt; plot(x1, col = mycolor)
&gt; col2rgb(&quot;pink&quot;)
      [,1]
red    255
green  192
blue   203
&gt; library(&quot;gplots&quot;)
&gt; col2hex(&quot;pink&quot;)
[1] &quot;#FFC0CB&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Points ===

For points the symbols can be changed using the &lt;code&gt;pch&lt;/code&gt; option which takes integer values between 0 and 25 or a single character. &lt;code&gt;pch&lt;/code&gt; can also takes a vector as argument. In that case the first points will use the first element of the vector as symbol, and so on.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot(x1, type = &quot;p&quot;, pch = 0)
plot(x1, type = &quot;p&quot;, pch = 10)
plot(x1, type = &quot;p&quot;, pch = 25)
plot(x1, type = &quot;p&quot;, pch = &quot;a&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;p&quot;, pch = &quot;*&quot;)
plot(x1[1:26], type = &quot;p&quot;, pch = 0:25)
plot(x1[1:26], type = &quot;p&quot;, pch = letters)
&lt;/source&gt;

The following code displays all the symbols on the same plot : 
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
x &lt;- rep(1,25)
plot(x, pch = 1:25, axes = F, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;)
text(1:25,.95,labels = 1:25)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;points()&lt;/code&gt; adds points to an existing plot. 
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; plot(x1, pch = 0) # plot x1 
&gt; points(x2, pch = 1, col = &quot;red&quot;) # add x2 to the existing plot
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Lines ===

We can change the line type with &lt;code&gt;lty&lt;/code&gt;. The argument is a string (&quot;blank&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;dashed&quot;, &quot;dotted&quot;, &quot;dotdash&quot;, &quot;longdash&quot;, or &quot;twodash&quot;) or an integer (0=blank, 1=solid (default), 2=dashed, 3=dotted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash). The line width can be changed with &lt;code&gt;lwd&lt;/code&gt;. The default is &lt;code&gt;lwd=1&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;lwd=2&lt;/code&gt; means that the width is twice the normal width.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;blank&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;solid&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;dotted&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;dotdash&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;longdash&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;twodash&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;lines()&lt;/code&gt; adds an additional lines on a graph. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;solid&quot;)
lines(x2, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;abline()&lt;/code&gt; adds an horizontal line (&lt;code&gt;h=&lt;/code&gt;), a vertical line (&lt;code&gt;v=&lt;/code&gt;) or a linear function to the current plot (&lt;code&gt;a=&lt;/code&gt; for the constant and &lt;code&gt;b=&lt;/code&gt; for the slope). &lt;code&gt;abline()&lt;/code&gt; can also plot the regression line.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;, lty = &quot;solid&quot;)
&gt; abline(h= -3, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;gray&quot;)
&gt; abline(v = 0, lty = &quot;dashed&quot;, col = &quot;gray&quot;)
&gt; abline(a = -3 , b = .06, lty = &quot;dotted&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Boxes === 

Each graph is framed by a box. &lt;code&gt;bty&lt;/code&gt; specifies the box type. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot(x1, bty = &quot;o&quot;) # the default
plot(x1, bty = &quot;n&quot;) # no box
plot(x1, bty = &quot;l&quot;)
plot(x1, bty = &quot;7&quot;)
plot(x1, bty = &quot;u&quot;)
plot(x1, bty = &quot;c&quot;)
plot(x1, bty = &quot;]&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

See also &lt;code&gt;box()&lt;/code&gt; to add a box to an existing plot.

=== Grid ===

&lt;code&gt;grid()&lt;/code&gt; adds a grid to the current graph.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; plot(x1)
&gt; grid()
&lt;/source&gt;

Although grid has an optional argument nx for setting the number of grid lines, it is not possible to tell it explicitly where to place those lines (it will usually not place them at integer values). A more precise and manageable alternative is to use abline(). 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; abline(v=(seq(0,100,5)), col=&quot;lightgray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;)
&gt; abline(h=(seq(0,100,5)), col=&quot;lightgray&quot;, lty=&quot;dotted&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Arrows and segments ===

{{...}}

=== Polygons ===

{{...}}

=== Other figures ===

We can also add a circle to a plot with the &lt;code&gt;circle()&lt;/code&gt; function in the '''calibrate''' package.

=== Background ===

You can choose the background of your plot. For instance, you can change the background color with &lt;code&gt;par(bg=)&lt;/code&gt;. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
par(bg=&quot;whitesmoke&quot;)
par(bg=&quot;transparent&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Overlaying plots ===

&lt;code&gt;matplot()&lt;/code&gt; can plot several plots at the same time. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
N &lt;- 100
x1 &lt;- rnorm(N)
x2 &lt;- rnorm(N) + x1 + 1
y &lt;- 1 + x1 + x2 + rnorm(N)
mydat &lt;- data.frame(y,x1,x2)
matplot(mydat[,1],mydat[,2:3], pch = 1:2)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Multiple plots === 

With &lt;code&gt;par()&lt;/code&gt; we can display multiple figures on the same plot. &lt;code&gt;mfrow = c(3,2)&lt;/code&gt; prints 6 figures on the same plot with 3 rows and 2 columns. &lt;code&gt;mfcol = c(3,2)&lt;/code&gt; does the same but the order is not the same. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
par(mfrow = c(3,2))
plot(x1, type = &quot;n&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;p&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;h&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;s&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;S&quot;)

par(mfcol = c(3,2))
plot(x1, type = &quot;n&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;p&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;l&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;h&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;s&quot;)
plot(x1, type = &quot;S&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Plotting a function ===

* &lt;code&gt;curve()&lt;/code&gt; plots a function. This can be added to an existing plot with the option &lt;code&gt;add = TRUE&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;plot()&lt;/code&gt; can also plots functions.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
curve(x^2, from = -1 , to = 1, main = &quot;Quadratic function&quot;, ylab = &quot;f(x)=x^2&quot;)

plot(rnorm(100))
curve((x/100)^2, add = TRUE, col = &quot;red&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Exporting graphs ==

How can you export a graph ?
* First you can plot the graph and use the context menu (right click on Windows and Linux or control + click on Mac) to copy or save the graphs. The available options depend on your operating system. On Windows, you can also use copy the current graph to the clipboard as a Bitmap file (raster graphics) using CTRL + C or as a Windows Metafile (vector graphics) using CTRL + W. You can then paste it into another application.
* You can export a plot to '''pdf''', '''png''', '''jpeg''', '''bmp''' or '''tiff''' by adding &lt;code&gt;pdf(&quot;filename.pdf&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;png(&quot;filename.png&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jpeg(&quot;filename.jpg&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bmp(&quot;filename.bmp&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;tiff(&quot;filename.tiff&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; prior to the plotting, and &lt;code&gt;dev.off()&lt;/code&gt; after the plotting. 
* You can also use the &lt;code&gt;savePlot()&lt;/code&gt; function to save existing graphs. 
* Sweave also produce ps and pdf graphics (See the [[R_Programming/Publication_Quality_Ouput#Sweave | Sweave section]]). 

It is better to use vectorial devices such as '''pdf''', '''ps''' or '''svg'''.

How can you know the list of all available devices ?
* &lt;code&gt;?Devices&lt;/code&gt; 
* Use the &lt;code&gt;capabilities()&lt;/code&gt; function to see the list of available devices on your computer.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot; width=80&gt;
?Devices
&gt; capabilities()
    jpeg      png     tiff    tcltk      X11     aqua http/ftp  sockets 
    TRUE     TRUE     TRUE     TRUE    FALSE    FALSE     TRUE     TRUE 
  libxml     fifo   cledit    iconv      NLS  profmem    cairo 
    TRUE    FALSE     TRUE     TRUE     TRUE     TRUE    FALSE 
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
png(&quot;r_plot.png&quot;, width = 420, height = 340)
plot(x1, main = &quot; Example&quot;)
dev.off()

pdf(&quot;r_plot.pdf&quot;, width = 420, height = 340) 
plot(x1, main = &quot; Example&quot;)
dev.off()

postscript(file=&quot;graph1.ps&quot;,horizontal=F,pagecentre=F,paper=&quot;special&quot;,width=8.33,height=5.56) 
plot(x1, main = &quot;Example&quot;)
dev.off()

plot(x1, main = &quot;Example&quot;)
savePlot(&quot;W:/Bureau/plot.pdf&quot;, type = &quot;pdf&quot;)
savePlot(&quot;W:/Bureau/plot.png&quot;, type = &quot;png&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

We can also export to [[w:Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] using the &lt;code&gt;svg()&lt;/code&gt; function. 
&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
svg(&quot;scatterplot.svg&quot;, width = 7, height = 7)
plot(x, y)
dev.off()
&lt;/source&gt;

The '''RSvgDevice''' library which was used in earlier versions of R seems now outdated.

== Advanced topics ==

=== Animated plots ===

The '''animation''' package provides dynamic graphics capabilities. It is possible to export the animation in flash, mpeg or gif format. There are more example on the aniwiki website : http://animation.yihui.name/.

You can also create ''motion charts'' using the '''googleVis''' package&lt;ref&gt;Tutorial for the '''googleVis''' package : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4646779/embedding-googlevis-charts-into-a-web-site/4649753#4649753&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Examples ====

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Em_old_faithful.gif
&lt;/gallery&gt;



=== Interactive Graphics ===
The '''iplots''' package provides a way to have interactive data visualization in R&lt;ref&gt;http://www.r-bloggers.com/interactive-graphics-with-the-iplots-package-from-%E2%80%9Cr-in-action%E2%80%9D/&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.r-statistics.com/2012/01/interactive-graphics-with-the-iplots-package-from-r-in-action/ Interactive Graphics with the iplots Package] - a chapter from the ''R in action'' book&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [http://www.r-statistics.com/2010/10/r-gui-now-offers-interactive-graphics-deducer-0-4-2-connects-with-iplots/ R GUI now offers interactive graphics – Deducer 0.4-2 connects with iplots]

To create an interactive, animated plot viewable in a web browser, the [https://github.com/tdhock/animint animint package] can be used. The main idea is to define an interactive animation as a list of ggplots with two new aesthetics:
* showSelected=variable means that only the subset of the data that corresponds to the selected value of variable will be shown.
* clickSelects=variable means that clicking a plot element will change the currently selected value of variable.

== Graphics gallery ==

In this section, we review all kind of statistical plots and review all alternatives to draw them using R. This include code for the standard graphics package, the '''lattice''' package and the '''ggplot2''' package. Also, we add some examples from the [[Commons:Category:Created_with_R|commons repository]]. We only add examples which are provided with the R code. You can click on any graph and find the R code.

{{Commons|Category:Created with R}}

=== Line plot ===

To draw a line plot, use the generic &lt;code&gt; plot()&lt;/code&gt; function by setting &lt;code&gt; type=&quot;l&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x &lt;- seq(0, 2*pi, pi/10)
&gt; plot(x, sin(x), type=&quot;l&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Then, you can add further lines on the same plot using the &lt;code&gt; lines() &lt;/code&gt; function.

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; lines(x, cos(x))
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Examples ====

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:EurUsd.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Scatter plot ===
{{Wikipedia|Scatter plot}}

* &lt;code&gt;plot(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;plot(y ~ x)&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;xyplot(y ~ x)&lt;/code&gt; ('''lattice''')
* &lt;code&gt;qplot(x,y)&lt;/code&gt; ('''ggplot2''')

==== Log scale ====

Sometimes it is useful to plot the log of a variable and to have a log scale on the axis.
It is possible to plot the log of a variable using the &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; option in the &lt;code&gt;plot()&lt;/code&gt; function. 
* For a log log plot, use &lt;code&gt;log = &quot;xy&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* For a log in the x axis only, use &lt;code&gt;log = &quot;x&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
* For a log in the x axis only, use &lt;code&gt;log = &quot;y&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot(x, y , log = &quot;xy&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Label points in a plot ====

* It is possible to add labels with the &lt;code&gt;text()&lt;/code&gt; function. 
* &lt;code&gt;textxy()&lt;/code&gt; ('''calibrate''') makes it easy to add labels.  

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
N &lt;- 10
u &lt;-rnorm(N)
x &lt;- 1 + rnorm(N)
y &lt;- 1 + x + u
plot(x, y)
textxy(x, y,labs = signif(x,3), cx=0.7)
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Examples ====

=== Histogram ===

{{Wikipedia|histogram}}

* &lt;code&gt;hist() &lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;histogram()&lt;/code&gt; ('''lattice''')

* &lt;code&gt;barplot()&lt;/code&gt; takes a table as argument and returns a bar chart.
* &lt;code&gt;qlot()&lt;/code&gt; ('''ggplot2''') with the option &lt;code&gt;geom = &quot;bar&quot;&lt;/code&gt; takes a variable as argument and returns a bar chart&lt;ref&gt;Hadley Wickham ''ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis'', Springer Verlag, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* &lt;code&gt;barchart()&lt;/code&gt; takes a variable as argument and returns a bar chart.

=== Treemap ===
{{...}}
The &lt;code&gt;tmPlot()&lt;/code&gt; function in the '''treemap''' package makes it easy to draw a [[:w:Treemapping|treemap]].

=== Confidence inteval plot === 
Standard error bar chart are very useful to plot several estimates with confidence intervals. 
* The '''Hmisc''' package has an &lt;code&gt;errbar()&lt;/code&gt; function. This function takes the upper and lower bounds of the confidence intervals as argument&lt;ref name = &quot;errbar&quot;&gt;The default output in &lt;code&gt;errbar()&lt;/code&gt; changed between R version 2.8.1 and R version 2.9.2. Axis are not displayed by default anymore&lt;/ref&gt;.

* &lt;code&gt;coefplot()&lt;/code&gt; function in Gelman and Hill's '''arm''' package. This functions is designed to display estimation results. It takes point estimates and standard errors as arguments. 

&lt;source lang = &quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
coefs &lt;- c(0.2, 1.4, 2.3, 0.5,.3) # vector of point estimates
se &lt;- c(0.12, 0.24, 0.23, 0.15,.2) # standard errors of point estimates
variable &lt;- 1:5 # variable names
library(&quot;arm&quot;)
# we use CI = qnorm(.975) to have 95% confidence interval
coefplot(coefs, se, variable, vertical = T, CI = qnorm(.975)) 
coefplot(coefs, se, variable, vertical = F, CI = qnorm(.975))
library(&quot;Hmisc&quot;)
errbar(variable, coefs, coefs - qnorm(.975) * se, coefs + qnorm(.975) * se)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to the &lt;font color=&quot;#0B2645&quot;&gt;''''R''''&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;#0A4E98&quot;&gt;'''programming'''&lt;/font&gt; Wikibook&lt;/h2&gt;
__NOTOC__

This book is designed to be a practical guide to the '''R programming language'''&lt;ref name = &quot;RCoreTeam&quot;&gt;R Development Core Team (2009). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. ISBN 3-900051-07-0, URL http://www.R-project.org.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''R''' is free software designed for statistical computing. There is already great documentation for the standard R packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)&lt;ref name = &quot;Rmanuals&quot;&gt;[http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/ CRAN manuals]&lt;/ref&gt; and many resources in specialized books, forums such as Stackoverflow&lt;ref&gt;[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r R on Stackoverflow]&lt;/ref&gt; and personal blogs&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.r-bloggers.com/ R-Bloggers]&lt;/ref&gt;, but all of these resources are scattered and therefore difficult to find and to compare. The aim  of this Wikibook is to be the place where anyone can share his or her knowledge and tricks on '''R'''. It is supposed to be organized by task but not by discipline&lt;ref name = &quot;crantaskview&quot;&gt;The CRAN Task View is already organized by discipline.&lt;/ref&gt;. We try to make a cross-disciplinary book, i.e. a book that can be used by all people applying statistics to some specific fields.

== How can you share your R experience ? ==
* Explain the syntax of a command
* Compare the different ways of performing each task using '''R'''.
* Try to make unique examples based on fake data (ie simulated data sets).
* As with any Wikibook please feel free to make corrections, expand explanations, and make additions where necessary.

Some rules : 
* Put the name of functions in the code environment : &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;lm()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* Put the name of packages in bold : &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''stats'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* Except for the default packages, put the name of the package in parenthesis after each function : &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;MCMCprobit()&lt;/code&gt; ('''MCMCpack''')&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Put examples in the source environment with argument &lt;code&gt;lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&lt;/code&gt; : &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* Use references to package documentations, academic literature and wikipedia.
* Use the citations templates to make citations : [[Template:Cite book]], [[Template:Cite web]], [[Template:Cite journal]] 
* If you want to add a graph, you should load it on [[Commons:Special:UploadWizard|Commons]] and add the tag &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Created with R}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and, if it is applicable, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Images with R source code]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

== Prerequisites ==
We assume that readers have a background in statistics. This book is not a book about statistics but a book about how to implement statistical methods using '''R'''. We try to use terms which are already defined on Wikipedia such that people can refer to the corresponding wikipedia page each time they have some doubts on a notion.

We also assume that readers are familiar with computers and that they know how to use software with a [[w:Command-line interface|command-line interface]]. There are some graphical user interfaces for '''R''' but we are not going to explain how to use them in this textbook. Beginners should have a look at the [[R Programming/Sample Session|Sample session]] for a first session with '''R'''. They can also have a look at the [[Statistical Analysis: an Introduction using R]] book.

A         or   Amaj      [0 0 2 2 2 0] (C# E  A) : major triad

NOTE//////all Db's down to &quot;A7/add11&quot; should be spelled C#.  
Most of the flat notes in this table should be spelled enharmonically (i.e. lowered one letter and given a #). 
Most guitar music is in keys that have sharps in the key signature. also, all triads in the type of music that 
uses the chords below are spelled in the following manner (this is intependent of the key; the notes may be 
sharp or flat depending on the key signature, but they will always be spelled this way): ACE, BDF, CEG, DFA, EGB, FAC, GBD./////

It seems to me that this person didn't have any real idea of the theory.  A Db is NOT a Major Third in the context of a chord starting on A.  It may be sonically but it's not that way theoretically.  Db is a diminished fourth not a major third.  Which makes all those chords A Diminished 4 not A Major.  I might change them myself.  Before I do someone is welcome to argue this point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This article describes the process to configure an iBook to compile C code written with OpenXDK, and make Xbox native executables. At the time of writing, the author had successfully compiled a Windows executable but had not been able to convert it to an Xbox executable.

__TOC__

== Overview ==

All of these steps are fairly straight forward, although there are some tricks that the novice needs to know to bypass hours of &quot;googling&quot;. The process taken is similar to installing OpenXDK on Linux, but differs because in this example we're using a PowerPC processor. This means that we first have to build a cross compiler. The assumption is that you know how to access the shell.

== DarwinPorts ==

DarwinPorts is a way to track and install open source programs to your system easily. It is designed specifically for Darwin (as the name suggests), and using this you can download MingGW. The current version of DarwinPorts is 1.2, and it comes in a handy installer package. Once it's installed, run the following command to update the internal list of available ports:

:$ sudo port -d selfupdate

=== MinGW ===

The MingGW compilers and Windows API libraries let you write and compile programs for execution on the i386 system. Although you can download a copy of everything you need from the website, using DarwinPorts to download the right files for you is a better option. To download the tools needed, run the command:

:$ sudo port install i386-mingw32-gcc

This will download, configure and install the gcc cross-compiler and tools to your system. Note: this step will take a while.

=== Compile Errors ===

As of this writing, there is a compile error when the installer executes make for the binutils package. The exact error is listed below:

:$.../work/binutils-2.15.91-20040904-1/gas/config/tc-i386.h:457: error: array type has incomplete element type

To get around this problem, change the compiler to gcc-3.3 when preparing the build.

:$ sudo gcc_select 3.3

Then, once the binutils package has compiled successfully, halt the install (Ctrl+C) (the install will fail anyway) and change the compiler back to gcc-4.0. Then the install should complete successfully.

=== Testing ===

This is an option step. I just tested that the setup worked, by writing a Hello World! program, and running it on my Windows box. The contents of hello.c are shown below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
 {
 	printf (&quot;Hello\n&quot;);
 	return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Then to compile, it's just like normal gcc/++:

&lt;kbd&gt;$ i386-mingw32-gcc -o hello.exe hello.c&lt;/kbd&gt;

This produces a windows executable hello.exe that can be run natively in Windows. Note that this only tests the cross compiler setup, and not OpenXDK.

== OpenXDK ==

OpenXDK is a free kit for developing applications that will run on the Xbox. It contains a complete libc replacement, uses SDL for multimedia (sound and networking are not currently supported) and compiles with gcc.

You can download the latest version from SourceForge. Make sure to download the binary file OpenXDK_#_bin.zip (where # is the version). Note: although it says it's for the i386 platform, that's our target system, and OpenXDK will NOT compile (even with i386-mingw32-gcc) on the Mac.

=== Cxbe ===

Cxbe comes with OpenXDK, and is located in the bin directory. It is responsible for converting the Windows executable into an Xbox executable. You won't be able to use the one provided, as it is for Windows.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing the Cxbe source in the OpenXDK_src package is from an older version than the compiled version in the OpenXDK_bin package. Until a workaround surfaces, we will have to send the half completed executable to a Windows box and run Cxbe there.

== Compiling ==

To compile C code written for the xBox, you need a lengthy flag list for the compiler. The following was adapted from the [http://www.openXDK.org/ OpenXDK Website]. This assumes that you have a working version of cxbe on your system.

: # installed OpenXDK path
: XDK = /usr/local/openXDK

: # cross-compiler
: CC = i386-mingw32-gcc

: # cxbe path (for post-processing)
: CXBE = $(XDK)/bin/cxbe

: SDLFLAGS = -DENABLE_XBOX -DDISABLE_CDROM 
: CC_FLAGSA = -g -std=gnu99 -ffreestanding -nostdlib -fno-builtin
: CC_FLAGSB = -fno-exceptions -mno-cygwin -march=i386 $(SDLFLAGS)
: INCLUDE = -I$(XDK)/i386-pc-xbox/include -I$(XDK)/include -I$(XDK)/include/SDL

: CLINK = -nostdlib
: ALIGN = -Wl,--file-alignment,0x20 -Wl,--section-alignment,0x20 
: SHARED = -shared
: ENTRYPOINT = -Wl,--entry,_WinMainCRTStartup 
: STRIP = -Wl,--strip-all
: LD_FLAGS = $(CLINK) $(ALIGN) $(SHARED) $(ENTRYPOINT) $(STRIP)
: LD_DIRS = -L$(XDK)/i386-pc-xbox/lib -L$(XDK)/lib 
: LD_LIBS = $(LD_DIRS) -lSDL -lopenXDK -lhal -lc -lhal -lc -lusb -lxboxkrnl

: all: default.exe

: *.o: *.c
: 	$(CC) $(CC_FLAGSA) $(CC_FLAGSB) $(INCLUDE) $&lt;

: default.exe: *.o
: 	$(CC) -c $&lt; -o $@ $(LD_LIBS) $(LD_FLAGS)
: 	$(CXBE) -TITLE:&quot;$@&quot; -DUMPINFO:&quot;default.cxbe&quot; -OUT:&quot;default.xbe&quot; $@ &gt;/dev/null

: clean: 
: 	rm -f *.o *.xbe *.cxbe *.exe

== Conclusion ==

While there is limited support for Xbox development on the Mac, because of the use of Linux to develop legal Xbox executables and the fact that Mac OS X is built on a flavor of Unix, it is possible to piggy-back Linux's support sources and (with slight manipulation) produce a viable solution to Mac Xbox Development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{tw-adopt}}
{{mergeto|Driving}}
====The Friction Point====
*With the shifter in neutral, push the clutch all the way down with your left foot and start the engine.  
*After the engine starts, wait for engine speed to return to idle.
*Shift to 1st gear, then slowly release the clutch without touching the accelerator.  Stop any pedal movement when the engine's RPM dips slightly. The clutch is at the friction point since the clutch plate begins to experience friction as it presses against the flywheel.
*Push the clutch down to the floor and practice releasing to the friction point a few times.  Note how the clutch pedal and engine's RPM changes, if any.

====Moving For The First Time====
While on level ground, where you should be when you learn to drive a manual, follow the steps below
*Push the clutch all the way down, shift to first gear, and release the parking brake.
*Release the clutch to the friction point.  The car should begin to move.
*If it doesn't, touch the gas pedal to raise the engine speed slightly.  Ease the pressure off of the clutch pedal slightly until the car moves.  Then stop any pedal movements.
*Wait about 2 seconds, then completely release the clutch.
====Get Going Faster====
The car moves because the engine is losing a bit of its momentum.  Although it burns fuel to recover lost momentum, the engine stops running if it loses too much (see stalling below).  If we want to get going faster, we need to get more momentum from the engine by releasing the clutch faster.  At the same time, we have to add more gas so the engine can recover that momentum to keep running.  The steps are similar to the above until you get to the friction point.
*Once you are at the friction point, add a small amount of gas without moving the clutch pedal.  The engine should raise its speed slightly.
*Ease the pressure off of the clutch until the engine slows down a bit.  The car should be moving noticeably at this point.
*Hold the pedals steady for about one second, then completely release the clutch.
A beginner should concentrate on performing these skills smoothly.  Once smoothness is mastered, practicing coordination is the next goal.  As the engine speed rises, a competent driver would ease off of the clutch just enough to stop the engine speed from rising further.  That would get the vehicle moving even quicker.  Once the car starts moving, stop any pedal movements for about one second before completely releasing the clutch.
====Shifting Concepts====
In a manual transmission car, the driver is responsible for operating a clutch and changing what gear the car is in using a gear shifter. The driver is required to correctly operate these two devices in order to start, accelerate, decelerate and stop the car. 

The basic concept of shifting is to allow the car's engine to turn the wheels at one of several different gear ratios. Each gear has a fairly wide range of vehicle speeds that it covers, with plenty of overlap between the gears, except at extreme vehicle speeds. Near the limits of the car's speed, the speed of the car dictates the gear ratio. If the vehicle is to move at the slowest possible crawling pace with the engine engaged, that requires the lowest gear to be selected; the engine will stall in any other gear (if it does not, it is not the slowest possible crawling speed!). At the car's top speed, it may be necessary to be in the highest gear, so that the engine does not spin beyond its &quot;redline&quot; limit.   This basic connection between gear ratios and speeds is why gears are sometimes called &quot;speeds&quot;, as in &quot;five speed transmission&quot;.
 
At the intermediate speeds not near the limits, the driver has a choice of two or more possible gear ratios. As a rule of thumb, a lower gear from among these, possibly the lowest, is chosen when power is required in order to accelerate or to climb a hill, or to provide &quot;engine braking&quot; to reduce or prevent unwanted acceleration when driving downhill.  Higher gears are chosen when less power or less engine braking is required, in order to save fuel, reduce engine wear and minimize noise. 

Before the driver can change gears, the clutch must be disengaged. The clutch is a mechanism that temporarily disengages the transmission and drivetrain from the engine of the vehicle. Once the clutch is depressed the driver can change gears without disrupting the smooth motion of the vehicle. When the car is in the desired gear, the driver then releases the clutch to allow the engine to turn the wheels again. 

If the gear is changed without depressing the clutch, the gears may grind which can cause damage to the transmission. If a gear that is too low is selected, the wheels may be spinning too fast for the clutch to catch, again grinding the gears. Alternatively, if the clutch does catch the engine may be forced to spin faster than it is capable of which can damage the engine. If a gear that is too high is selected, the gearing ratio will force the engine to rotate at a speed that is too slow and the engine may stall.

====Upshifting====
When accelerating in any forward gear other than top gear, shift up when the engine is turning at too high a speed for the current gear. The engine speed that constitutes &quot;too high&quot; varies from vehicle to vehicle and according to the driver's taste, but the absolute upper limit is usually marked on most vehicles equipped with a tachometer as a red area called the redline. Running the engine past this speed can cause damage to internal components of the engine (and most modern cars with electronic engine control computers will not permit the engine to be run past the redline).  In practice, one usually shifts up well before the engine speed reaches redline.  The vehicle's owner's manual should contain a table of recommended upshift speeds, but as a general rule of thumb, consider shifting between 2000 and 3000 rpm - although in some small engines that make power higher in the rev band shifting around 3500rpm can drop you to a better part of the power band in the next gear.
This can be quite different for different cars, as a rule of thumb its a good idea to shift up around 500rpm above the revs the engine does in top gear at 100kph&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;
(Note that in a diesel you will usually have to shift at a lower rpm, and the redline is likely to be lower.)

For maximum acceleration, one may shift just before reaching the redline, but for ordinary driving, to conserve fuel, one should shift between a little above the engine's maximum torque speed and the lowest engine speed possible without &quot;lugging&quot; the engine.  With practice, you will be able to tell when to do this by the sound of the engine.

To upshift:

* Release the accelerator pedal. Alternatively, if you are experienced enough to shift quickly, you may be able to partially release and then reapply the accelerator pedal at the same time as declutching and shifting.
* Press and hold the '''clutch''' pedal with your left foot.
* '''Reapply''' throttle to a level appropriate for the higher gear. If you are experienced enough to shift quickly and smoothly, you may be able to partially release the accelerator pedal while shifting, and the engine will roughly synchronise. Alternatively if you shift quickly enough, reapply the throttle after reengaging the clutch.
* Move the gear shift knob, depending on the gear that is currently selected:
** To shift from an odd-numbered gear (i.e. 1st or 3rd) into the next highest gear, move the shift knob '''down''', through neutral, to the corresponding position on the bottom row.
** To shift from an even-numbered gear (i.e. 2nd or 4th) into the next highest gear, move the shift knob '''up''' to neutral, one column to the '''right''', then '''up''' to the new position on the top row.
* Smoothly release the clutch pedal, allowing the new, lower engine speed to match up with the vehicle's speed.

If you take longer than a second or so to upshift, the engine will probably have slowed down too much for the new gear, and the car will probably jerk backward a bit unless you increase throttle to compensate.  Don't increase the throttle too much though, or the engine will be going too fast for the new gear and the car will jerk forward.  Once your skill at &quot;matching revs&quot; improves you can release the clutch pedal more quickly without any jerkiness.

====Downshifting====
When decelerating in any gear above second gear, shift down when the engine is turning at too low a speed for the current gear.  The speed that constitutes &quot;too low&quot; varies among vehicles, and you can afford to keep it in a higher gear if little acceleration is needed, but as a rule of thumb, consider downshifting when the engine reaches 1500 RPM.  With some practice, you will be able to hear the engine speed and make this judgement.

Although rapid acceleration is never really necessary, it often saves time, can sometimes help to merge into moving traffic and is enjoyable to some people.  For rapid acceleration or to climb a steep grade, while the car is already moving in a higher gear, one downshifts, to increase the engine's revs to a point at which it can produce more power.  (Beginners may prefer to stop and shift into first before climbing a hill.)

If you notice the RPM decreasing steadily to a low value while climbing a steep hill, despite having a firm foot on the throttle, you should immediately switch to a lower gear or the car may stall and roll down the hill.

It is important not to shift into too low a gear for the car's speed: for instance, shifting into second at highway speeds. Firstly, it should be known that this is bad for the transmission even before the clutch is released. Downshifting into a low gear at high speed causes the input side of the transmission (which connects to the engine via the clutch) to spin excessively fast, possibly much faster than the maximum redline of the engine. This creates stresses in the machinery, and also undue wear on the synchronizers which are doing the job of spinning up the input shaft. Of course, if the clutch is engaged while the transmission input shaft is spinning beyond the engine's &quot;red line&quot;, the engine will likely be severely damaged. (In this case, even the engine control computer's rev-limiting function cannot help, as the engine is being driven by the momentum of the car).  It is always safe to downshift to the next lower gear when the engine is turning at too low a speed for the current gear.  If you &quot;miss&quot; a downshift and hear the engine revving too fast as you let out the clutch, immediately push the clutch back in and shift into a higher gear. Also, pay attention to signs of missing a downshift even before the clutch is released. It takes time to spin up the transmission input shaft to an excessive RPM, and so the stick is more difficult to push into gear if the wrong gear is selected. Also, there may be an audible high pitched whine, similar to an electric drill, as parts of the transmission spin up to a high RPM during the shift.

Due to the larger differences in gear ratio between first and second gear, it's usually best not to downshift into first gear unless you plan to be driving very slowly for some time.  Instead, stay in second gear and disengage the clutch when you're about to come to a stop.  In some special cases (very steep slopes, crawling traffic) first gear can be useful, however.  In some vehicles, it is easier to shift into first gear from a stop than to downshift from second.

To downshift:

* '''Release''' the accelerator pedal, unless you are skilled enough to only partially reduce the throttle.&lt;!-- alternatively a skilled driver can sense engine load and adjust throttle and shift fast enough to avoid this step, but advice for learner should be to release first --&gt;
* '''Press''' and hold the clutch pedal with your left foot.
* '''Reapply''' throttle to a level appropriate for the current speed of travel in the lower gear.  This is (somewhat) optional, since gradually releasing the clutch will adjust for a slight mismatch, however if you completely release the accelerator while at the same time shifting too slowly you are likely to have the car jerk somewhat. &lt;!-- this seems to assume engine is not under load, not the case uphill or at higher speeds, also jerking implies shifting is too slow/not smooth/not coordinated --&gt;
* Move the gear shift knob, depending on the gear that is currently selected:
** To shift from an even-numbered gear (i.e. 2nd or 4th) into the next lowest gear, move the shift knob '''up''', through neutral, to the corresponding position on the top row.
** To shift from an odd-numbered gear (i.e. 3rd or 5th) into the next lowest gear, move the shift knob '''down''' to neutral, one column to the '''left''', then '''down''' to the new position on the bottom row.
* Gradually '''release''' the clutch pedal, allowing the new, higher engine speed to match up with the vehicle's speed.  
* '''Adjust''' the throttle as necessary to decrease, maintain, or increase vehicle speed.&lt;!-- different settings are needed depending on gradient and driver intentions --&gt;
If you don't match the engine's speed properly for the lower gear, the car will probably jerk a bit.   Once your skill at &quot;matching revs&quot; improves you can release the clutch pedal more quickly without any jerkiness.

===Putting it All Together===
In actual driving, the individually learned skills of modulating engine torque with the clutch and shifting gears are performed together. Decisions are made on-the-fly and sometimes they have to be canceled or pre-empted as predictions about traffic dynamics turn out to be incorrect. It takes several months of practice before the skills are nearly internalized, and anywhere up to a year of daily driving to become a completely smooth, confident, manual transmission driver who ensures that the machine is always in the correct state in every situation. These are a few tips beyond starting, stopping and shifting:

====Sharp Turns====
Situation: The driver wishes to turn at an upcoming corner. Coming to a full stop is not required. 

Corners are taken at a fairly slow speed, which corresponds to the typical car's second gear: some 30 km/h or even slower. This means that accelerating out of the corner will require the transmission to be in second gear.

The steps are:

* The driver applies pressure to the brake pedal to slow the vehicle down, leaving the transmission in whatever gear it is in.
* Moments before approaching the corner, the car should be travelling at a speed in which second gear may be selected. The driver presses the clutch all the way to the floor and shifts into second gear.
* The clutch is released to complete the shift just before the steering is turned to execute the turn.
* Through the turn, the transmission remains in second gear. 
* Coming out the turn, the driver begins to accelerate and straighten the steering.
* By the time the driver shifts to third gear, the car is travelling straight.

By avoiding a transmission shift in the turn itself, the driver can steer with both hands. In some countries or states&amp;mdash;such as British Columbia, Canada&amp;mdash;if a new driver takes a licensing road test in a manual transmission, points are deducted for shifting in a turn, because there are safety issues with doing so.

====Slow-Moving Traffic====
Situation: the driver finds himself or herself in a heavily congested flow of traffic. Sometimes the cars ahead come to a full stop. In between stops they sometimes crawl at approximately a walking pace, and at other times speed up substantially only to rapidly slow down again.

In this situation, stressful for a new manual transmission driver, it is important that the driver remain calm and focused. The driver must remember that to prevent the engine from stalling at any time, all that is required is to depress the clutch pedal all the way down.

The trick is to keep moving smoothly while maintaining a generous gap to the next car, and stop and resume if necessary. It should all be done without slipping the clutch.

The driver should monitor the traffic as far ahead as visibility allows, to anticipate whether a complete stop is about to become necessary.

The driver should keep the transmission in second gear if possible and apply a light pressure to the accelerator pedal so that the vehicle slowly crawls forward. In first and second gear, particularly in first, the car is capable of moving very slowly without the engine stalling, or the necessity to slip the clutch. The manual transmission driver must learn to recognize situations in which it's useful to crawl slowly, and take advantage of the transmissions and engine's ability to do so.

But if an impending full stop is anticipated, the clutch is pressed all the way to the floor, and the other foot begins to brake. One of two events then happen:

* The car ahead in fact comes to a complete stop. After that, of course, the transmission must be put in first gear and an ordinary start must be performed, albeit this is probably very gentle start, since the car isn't about to accelerate anywhere fast! It's useful to practice slow starts in a parking lot, which is another situation in which they are useful. The goal is to quickly get the car rolling in first gear and let the clutch out all the way, but then remain at the low speed. This requires gentle throttle work to only maintain the RPMs a bit above idle during clutch engagement. As the clutch grabs, pressure on the accelerator stays light: it is not increased as would be the case if the intent were to accelerate.

* The car ahead does not come to a complete stop, but instead speeds up. Now, a decision must be made whether to release the clutch, stay in second gear, or to downshift to first gear. This depends entirely on the vehicle's speed and how much torque its engine has at very low RPMs. In time, experience with that particular vehicle will furnish the driver with the requisite intuition. (If the speed is very slow, less than about 5 mph or 8 km/h, it's possible to downshift to first gear in just about any car, even ones which can handle moving at these slow speeds in second gear). If downshifting to first gear is necessary, it is done without bringing the car to a complete stop. Releasing the clutch in this situation is different from releasing the clutch in first gear during a start from a complete stop. The clutch can be released much faster in first gear if the car is slowly rolling forward at about walking speed.

After downshifting to first gear, if that was necessary, the car can stay in that gear, with the clutch fully engaged. Very slow crawling can be achieved in first gear. Once the crawling is fast enough to take the engine RPM's into the 1500-2000 range, second gear should be selected once again. Again, anticipation of traffic ahead is very useful. If cars are stopping ahead, creating a backward-propagating wave of stoppage, there is no point in switching to a higher gear. It's better to just continue to crawl in first, and then disengage the clutch and apply pressure to the brake when the stop comes. Better yet, if possible, the driver can allow the engine braking effect in first gear to create a larger gap to the next car, and use the space, together with the slow crawling capabilities of first gear, to avoid stopping entirely.

With practice, these shifts between first and second gear in heavy traffic become second nature, as will the traffic monitoring and anticipation which eliminates unnecessary stopping, shifting and clutch work.

====The Canceled Stop====
Situation: the driver is approaching an intersection where traffic is stopped at a red light. He or she is following the manual transmission technique for coasting to a stop. However, just as the approach is nearly complete, the light changes and it's not necessary to come to a full stop. The stop manoeuver is preempted, and a dynamic decision must be made about how to proceed. The key input to this decision is the vehicle speed, which determines what gear the vehicle should be in. 

* If the vehicle almost came to a stop, and is rolling forward only very slowly less than 5 mph or 8 km/h, the driver may shift into first gear. At this speed, the driver should already have pressed the clutch all the way to the floor, in preparation for coming to a full stop. Because the car is rolling, the clutch can be released quite rapidly. (But if first gear is inappropriately selected at too high a speed, and the clutch is released rapidly, there will be a jerk!)

* If the speed is above approximately 5 mph or 8 km/h, but below around 20 mph or 30-35 km/h, the driver should select second gear, release the clutch fairly quickly and proceed.

* If the traffic change occurs above these speeds, resuming is possible in third gear. In fact, it's possible that the transmission is still in third gear and the clutch hasn't even been pressed down. In other words, it may be possible to just step on the accelerator and resume.

The tricky cases are the near-stops when the car is still rolling. The driver must select the correct gear based on speed, and be confident that a quick clutch release can be executed without stalling or jerking. The speedometer is of little use at these slow speeds. The driver, in fact, must not be staring at the speedometer and trying to reason about the correct gear. Rather, intuition for this must be learned through practice.

==Troubleshooting==
===Stalling===
When a vehicle's engine is turning at low speeds it is unable to provide much torque, and placing excessive demand on the engine will cause it to stop running suddenly, an event known as a stall. Stalling usually causes sudden jerking movements of the vehicle.

The following behaviours are likely to cause stalls:
* at a standstill, engaging the clutch too quickly, while the engine is turning too slowly;
* coming to a stop with the clutch engaged and the transmission in gear.
* trying to start from a standstill in high gear

If the driver stalls the engine, they should not panic. It happens to all beginners and even occasionally to experienced drivers, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. In order to get going again and not to hold up traffic, the driver can simply keep the brake and clutch depressed, then restart the engine (note that the key often needs to be turned back to its off position before the starter will operate again), select the correct gear if necessary, and then drive off.

If at any time the driver senses that the engine is about to stall, the clutch should immediately be depressed. If the driver gets scared or needs to come to a stop quickly, it is important to step on the clutch while instinctively hitting the brakes, otherwise the engine will probably stall.

The clutches in different vehicles vary in their sensitivity and range of movement, so even a very experienced driver in an unfamiliar vehicle can stall its engine a few times until he or she becomes familiar with its clutch.

===Stalling due to loss of traction while braking===
When decelerating, a driver will apply brakes and then disengage the clutch shortly before stopping (around 1000 RPM in 1st gear or somewhere above &quot;walking speed&quot; as above).  In normal conditions with good traction, this is fine. However, on some surfaces, and depending on the severity of the braking, without an Anti-lock Braking System, the wheels can lock up.  This can happen easily on slippery surfaces like snow, ice and loose gravel.  The poor traction on such surfaces can prevent the momentum of the car from turning the wheels, which leaves the engine as the only real force for the brakes to oppose.

When this happens, the first priority is to bring the vehicle safely to a stop or to regain braking and steering control. See also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cadence_braking cadence braking], an important skill for winter drivers without ABS equipped vehicles.

===Grinding Gears===
A grinding sound coming from a synchronized manual transmission during a shift is usually a sign of improper technique. Some hobbyist drivers blame the machinery: they claim that the synchro mechanism is worn, or there is some issue with the manual transmission lubricant. This comes up again and again in online automotive forums. In fact, the synchro mechanism would have to be completely gone for this to be true, and it's almost certainly not an issue with the lubricant.

Why does grinding happen in a synchronized transmission? It's because the overly zealous driver engages the clutch too fast, in parallel with moving the gearshift, in an attempt to minimize the overall shift time. Or, perhaps the driver is doing everything in the correct sequence, but failing to press the clutch far enough! Or, the driver has pushed the gearshifter very fast into the shift gate causing the synchronizer to be jammed up against the gear too quickly, and not allowed to do its job. Either way, the gear selector has already &quot;passed through&quot; the synchronizer, but not gone far enough for the teeth to actually engage. At this point, if the clutch is engaged, even slightly, the speed of the input shaft will change, and the synchronization will be lost. Since the selector has already been pushed through the ring, it's too late: the stick can be moved so that the teeth make contact. The result is grinding. 

Quite possibly, there could be a problem with the clutch: perhaps it is not disengaging all the way when the pedal is being pressed to the floor. The pedal might need adjustment, or there is some problem with the hydraulics or mechanical linkage, or other problem with the clutch mechanism itself. But here we are assuming that there is no mechanical problem. 

To avoid grinding, do the waltz: think 1-2-3. On the count of 1, press the clutch all the way down to the floor. On the count of 2, move the stick to the desired gear. On 3, release the clutch. To speed up the gear change, you must speed up these motions individually, and not &quot;cheat&quot; by trying to overlap steps 2 and 3. There is little room for that. In particular, the lever must be in the final position before the clutch moves off the floor. Where you can save time is by tightly combining 1 and 2. Push or pull on the stick while pressing the clutch, to get it moving as soon as possible. Practice the waltz: count 1-2-3 in your head. Try doing it very slowly, and then speed up the tempo.

To do a fast gear change without grinding, push the clutch pedal to the floor as fast as possible, in advance of moving the stick, but start moving the stick even before the clutch hits the floor. The clutch should be all the way down as the stick passes through the neutral position to the other gear, and should remain floored. Move the stick as fast as possible from one gear to the other, using speed and force. You should feel a resistance followed by a click; that's the resistance of the synchro, which needs time to do its job before allowing the selector to proceed. Finally, release the clutch. This is the slowest part of the transaction, but with practice, it can be sped up significantly.

The common mistake that causes grinding is not moving the stick fast enough before releasing the clutch; failing to coordinate the two motions. Sometimes drivers complain about grinding during steep gear changes, when the engine is revved to a high RPM in the lower gear. The synchro has to do more work to slow down the input shaft of the transmission to match up the next gear! This takes more time, but the driver is not adjusting for it. He or she is not waiting for the lever to pop through the synchro, and is releasing the clutch using a rehearsed timing, independently of what is going on in the gearbox. The foot doesn't know what the hand is doing and vice versa! The foot must be trained to wait for the hand to complete the gear selection.

Another situation in which grinding can be heard is when placing the transmission into reverse from a stopped position, e.g., when leaving a parking space. Grinding occurs here in part because reverse is often not a synchromesh gear. If one does not leave the transmission in reverse or a forward gear when parked, it is likely that   s/he will hear grinding in the transmission when shifting into reverse no matter how far the clutch pedal is held in when shifting. To avoid grinding in reverse, one must &quot;clear the gate&quot;: first place the gear shift into a forward gear, then shift into reverse. This will eliminate any grinding that is heard.  It works because all gears have the same speed when the car is stopped. On most 5-speed synchromesh transmissions, the gates will lock out a shift from 5th gear down into reverse as a safety feature; therefore, place the shifter into another forward gear before shifting into reverse.  Some old cars have synchromesh on the upper gears but not on 1st, so this procedure should be used every time they are started from a stop.  (Some old BMWs had synchromesh on first, for downshifts, but still crunched starting from a stop.)

One last note: the transmission oil can make a difference if the shift is being done improperly. A lubricant that doesn't have the proper friction additives will cause the synchro to take more time, giving rise to more opportunity for premature clutch release. This is why some technically inclined drivers report experiences like &quot;I switched my manual transmission fluid from brand X to brand Y and now I get more (or less) grinding&quot;.  Some cars also shift more easily when the transmission oil has warmed up; Mazda Miatas and Volkswagen Passats are particularly known for this.

==Advanced techniques==
This section discusses performance driving techniques, which may be detrimental to the life of the power train and other components of the vehicle.

===Easing out of gear (no clutch)===
It's possible to shift the transmission into neutral without using the clutch, and some of the other advanced techniques below call for this. However, taking the transmission out of gear may require a great deal of force, because the dog teeth are held in place by great torque between the input and output shafts. Pulling the teeth apart forcefully when they are jammed together by torque wears them. The force required is also demanding on the gear selector linkage and shift forks.

However, when the car is coasting to a stop, the engine eventually reaches a sufficiently low RPM at which there occurs a relaxation of the torque through the transmission. This relaxation can be perceived as a subtle change in the motion of the car; near a certain RPM value, the compression braking effect suddenly disappears, resulting in the sensation of a very slight forward jolt of the vehicle. This loss of the braking effect literally feels like a relaxation; the engine is neither propelling nor hindering the car's motion, because its idle speed is approximately matched to the rotation of the transmission's input shaft. In this condition, it may be acceptable to exert a light tug or push on the gear lever to see whether it can be gently coaxed out of gear. If it pops out easily, there is likely no harm done. On the other hand, if there is resistance, it can be relieved right away by pressing the clutch.

If the transmission remains in gear and the RPM drops further, the relaxation effect will disappear; the idle control mechanism will struggle to keep the engine turning, exerting torque on the slowing transmission. Sometimes the relaxation point is only very brief, or does not occur at all: for instance, when coming to a stop against an incline. The vehicle then decelerates due to gravity, regardless of the compression braking effect. Consequently, there will be only a tiny moment during which the transmission's speed will match the engine idle closely enough. The relaxation point may be located by exerting a continuous gentle force on the gear lever as the vehicle slows down.

Similarly, exerting continuous gentle force over a short period of time and lifting off the throttle (if accelerating), or blipping the throttle (if decelerating) will result in a smooth, clutch-free gear change to neutral. This is because you have created, via modulation of the throttle, a point where there was no torque holding the dog teeth together; if you were accelerating, lifting off for a moment produces a slight deceleration. In between accelerating and decelerating, there was a point where, as noted above, both the driving and the driven shafts, gears, dog teeth, etc. were spinning at the same speed, so there was no torque holding the dog teeth together, so you were able to move to neutral without the clutch.

===Power shifting (a.k.a. speed shifting)===
This is an advanced technique that gives a speed boost to the car when upshifting.  This should '''only''' be used in racing applications (and probably only in very short races), as it is very hard on drivetrain components, especially if done improperly.  Even done properly, it generally puts undue stress on the drivetrain, and shortens the lifespan of the driveline components.

To perform a power shift, keep the gas pedal on the floor (instead of lifting) while pushing in the clutch.  At the same time, quickly shift to the next gear.  Quickly re-engage (&quot;pop&quot;) the clutch as soon as the new gear is selected.  If done properly, the car will receive a &quot;bump&quot; in acceleration (due to the jerk of the decelerating engine) as the clutch is re-engaged.  If done improperly, it can result in engine or transmission damage, sometimes catastrophic.

===Heel-and-toe===
While decelerating, the technique of heel-and-toe shifting allows advanced drivers to maintain pressure on the brake pedal while simultaneously &quot;blipping&quot; the throttle to aid downshifts. This allows the car to remain flat and &quot;level&quot; while entering or exiting a turn. This is done by using the right foot to control both the brake as well as the gas pedal at the same time, normally done by keeping your foot at an angle, thus the term Heel-and-toe.

===Double clutching===
&quot;Double-clutching&quot; (also known as &quot;double-declutching&quot; in Europe) is an old technique that dates from before the days of synchromesh gear boxes. It can make downshifting (and arguably upshifting) smoother and can reduce transmission wear. It involves depressing the clutch and dropping into neutral, releasing the clutch, using throttle to match revs for the gear to be selected, depressing the clutch again and selecting the new gear. The action (which sounds more complicated than it really is) uses the engine to spin up the input shaft to more closely match the next  gear selected hence creating smoother shifts and reducing wear on synchromesh systems.  If the car is equipped with a tachometer, it may be used to help find the right engine speed.  Some types of unsynchronized manual transmissions '''require''' double-clutching.  These transmissions may be found in some older vehicles and race cars, as well as on large trucks, especially tractor-trailers. When we say require, if you mishap and pick a wrong gear, or take too long and are unable to double-clutch and match both halves of the transmission, you come to a stop and start all over again.

Double-clutching on a synchronized gearbox is unnecessary in most driving situations. Moreover, it is possible that an unskilled driver may second-guess something that the machine is designed to do automatically, and can cause more harm than good. A true unsynchronized transmission is unforgiving to mismatched speeds, requiring a great deal of precision from the driver. A synchronized transmission will allow the driver to get away with sloppy double-clutching, and an unskilled driver may end up causing more harm by not matching the engine speed properly.

However, even with a synchronized gearbox, double-clutching under skilled hands is desirable when shifting down to the lowest gears. The synchronizer, particularly the one for the second gear, receives much abuse, as the speed differential it has to manage is usually the greatest. It is indeed usually the second gear synchronizer that fails first. Some recent Honda manual transmissions incorporate a triple-cone synchronizer in the lowest gears for extra durability.

Many transmissions until recently did not have a synchronizer on the first gear. It is therefore necessary to double-clutch when downshifting into the first gear, though such instances are rare. Some transmissions today still do not have a synchronizer for the reverse gear, requiring that you come to a complete halt before shifting into reverse (see the &quot;Grinding gears&quot; section above for further implications of this). Double-clutching is of course impossible, as you cannot reverse the direction of the engine rotation.  You must simply wait for the car to come to a halt and engine revs to drop to idling.

===Single clutching===
A downshifting technique similar to a cross between double clutching and shifting without the clutch.  The transmission is taken out of gear while the clutch is still engaged.  The accelerator is then 'blipped' to bring the input shaft to the correct speed, the clutch is disengaged, the lower gear is selected and the clutch is engaged again.  This is a fairly common racing technique. 

Some drivers also use an even faster method than single clutch downshifting, which is also the method used in conjunction with heel-toe downshifting.  The clutch is disengaged, the driver selects the new gear while &quot;blipping&quot; the throttle up to bring the engine to approximately right speed and then the clutch is engaged again.  In other words, as the transmission's synchro changes the rotation of the input shaft during the gear selection, the driver simultaneously adjusts the engine revolution speed. The clutch can be released very quickly if the difference in rotation between the clutch disk and flywheel is small, so this gear change is likely the fastest technique on a synchronized tranmission. Some experienced drivers perform this revolution matching almost instinctively. During the downshift, as the gear selector passes between the gears, they hit the throttle to bring the engine revolutions up. The resulting gear change is not only faster, but it can be much smoother, as well as reduce the wear on the clutch.

===Shifting without the clutch===
It is possible to shift gears without using the clutch at all, by careful throttle manipulation. When transmissions were unsynchronized this was usually the easiest method, and still works in modern cars, although it requires a lot more practice than the usual methods described above.

Although the technique works in synchronized gearboxes, it is inappropriate in nearly all circumstances. A synchronized gearbox has a small clutch called a synchronizer (or &quot;synchro&quot;) in every forward gear which brings the input and output rotation to the same speed before allowing them to engage. Like the main clutch, these synchronizing clutches use friction. These synchronizing clutches will allow for a margin of error when engaging without the main clutch. If the engine speed is somewhat too high or too low, the synchro will essentially take on the job that the fully engaged main clutch isn't doing. However, a synchro ring is not intended to do the job of a main clutch. Its job is to spin up or spin down just the input part of the transmission that is assumed to be disconnected from the engine. It is not intended to speed up or slow down the entire engine. Such experimentation done on a regular basis will prematurely wear out the synchro rings, which will have to be replaced.

On cars with a freewheel, such as the older SAAB with a two-stroke engine, shifting without the clutch is standard procedure. But actually, the freewheel is a form of clutch: one that is disengaged whenever the input rotation is slower than then output rotation. One must disengage the freewheel by allowing the engine revolutions to drop, which is analogous to pressing the clutch pedal.

===Starting the vehicle without an electric starter===
Should the starter fail to operate due to a dead battery, electrical fault, or a defect in the starter itself, the vehicle may be startable via momentum. The energy to move the vehicle initially can be supplied either by gravity (if the vehicle is parked on a hill), or by people pushing. 
To start the vehicle on a hill if the vehicle is facing downhill: place the transmission in second gear with ignition key in the &quot;on&quot; position.  The clutch should be disengaged (clutch pedal pressed down), release the brake, and allow the car to roll. When it reaches about 10 km/h, release the clutch slowly, as if executing a steep downshift. The car will slow down due to compression braking as the engine spins up. If ignition and fuel are supplied to the engine, it will start. If it does not succeed the first time, try again with more speed. If it still doesn't work, whatever is preventing the engine from starting is also preventing it from running.

The techniques for starting while facing downhill and push-starting are similar. A single person may be able to push-start a compact car or mini-truck; it may take several people to start a larger vehicle. Use reverse gear for starting while facing uphill. 

Push starting is easiest and safest with at least two people. The assistants push, while the driver, sitting in the driver's seat, carries out the remaining steps. Push starting on level ground is more difficult and dangerous for a single person. He or she must push the car, and then when enough momentum is gained, jump into the driver's seat of the moving vehicle to complete the start. The driver must also be prepared to jump into the seat at any time to stop the vehicle. Therefore, it is necessary to push the car from the side, with the driver's door open. The driver is positioned behind the open driver's door, and applies force to a frame member of the car body, such as the windshield post or roof post. From this position, one hand can reach the steering wheel, and it's possible to jump into the car quickly.

'Important notes'

* If the engine turns over when the ignition is activated, but does not start, then the starter is working, and neither push-starting nor jump-starting will start the car. The car needs fuel or repair.

* If the starter failure was due to a discharged battery, it will recur unless the engine runs long enough to sufficiently recharge the battery.

* If the starter failure wasn't due to a discharged battery, it will certainly recur.  The car will have to continue to be push started, and must be taken to a mechanic to have the starter problem identified and repaired. 

* The alternator in the car is not meant to charge deeply discharged batteries. A proper battery charger includes a current limiting circuit which &quot;trickle charges&quot; the battery. A deeply discharged battery places a load on the car's charging system. Put the battery on a trickle charger at the earliest opportunity.

* If the battery is completely flat, push starting may not work, because modern cars have an alternator which does not contain permanent magnets. It has coils which require a small field current to generate a magnetic field. 

* Check the condition of the battery first. Some batteries have an hydrometer &quot;eye&quot;. If the eye is green, dark green or dark, attempting to push start should be okay. If it's clear or yellow, indicating an insufficient fluid level, don't jump or push start. The battery needs distilled water, and should not be charged. If it's a sealed battery, it should be replaced, since there is no means to add fluid.

* If the battery is frozen, do not push start or jump start the vehicle. The battery must thaw first. Frozen batteries should not be charged.

* Read the owner's manual of the vehicle for any special instructions regarding jump starting, and follow whatever reasonably applies to push starting also.

* If the car has power brakes or power steering, these will not function during the push start until the engine starts. If the car is being started by rolling down a hill and the engine fails to start, a lot of extra brake pressure will be needed to stop it, and extra force on the steering wheel will be needed to steer around any obstacles.

* Do not push the vehicle with another car or truck; the bumpers may slip, damaging both vehicles.

* Jumping into a moving car requires a modicum of athletic ability, coordination and daring.

* Pushing a car is a strenuous athletic effort. It must be done intensely in order to give the car maximum possible momentum in the shortest distance, which carries the same risks of over-exertion and injury as any intense exercise. It may be wise to first perform some light warm-up exercises and stretches involving all of the major muscle groups of the body.

* When riding a motorcycle, the sudden lock of the back tire when releasing the clutch can throw you in many directions. Drag your feet on the ground as to maintain balance.

===Compression braking===
This is also called &quot;engine braking&quot;: the use of the engine's internal resistance to slow down the vehicle, or keep it from accelerating down a hill. This is done by lifting your foot off the throttle when the engine is running at a speed sufficiently above idle. Shifting the car into a lower gear can amplify the effect.

''On the one hand,'' some feel that you abuse your manual transmission and engine by &quot;engine braking&quot;. They feel that you should downshift only when you anticipate that the car will be in a lower speed for some time, not when coming to a full stop. Some feel that the reason why you must keep the car in gear while slowing down or stopped but with the clutch disengaged is for emergency maneuvers, for it will give you the extra time to escape a pending accident. In this case, downshift late, allowing the car to slow to a pretty low engine RPM's before shifting down. 
This viewpoint says that using the manual transmission to stop the car is inappropriate under normal driving conditions. Simply put, when using the engine to slow the speed of the transmission, the clutch and synchronizers are unnecessarily being worn out for what the car brakes are designed to do. In comparison, the clutch typically costs around US$1,000 to fix as opposed to US$300 for new brake pads and installation. (However, clutches typically last far longer than brakes, so the two cannot be directly compared on price alone.) The method is provided only because one may find it occasionally necessary or useful to use engine braking (when one needs to decelerate more quickly than usual, for instance). 
'''If decelerating towards''' a full stop while in an upper gear, such as 4th, a downshift to a lower gear should be made, as this increases the time that a gear is engaged, therefore keeping the brake and power steering servos engaged and so power is supplied. Coasting time should be kept to a minimum using effective and well-timed downshifts.

''On the other hand'', some feel that engine braking is relatively harmless to the engine and transmission.  Smooth double clutching when down shifting will minimize wear on the clutch and synchronizers. Not picking gears to excessively rev the engine more than 3000rpm, yet not so slow you lose oil pressure. Stay above 500rpm to achieve sufficient oil pressure. As for engine wear, piston rings will be worn more, but keeping the RPM in a relative range will prevent them from stress of expanding and contracting at high speeds with the up and down movement of the piston. Also during deceleration the engine creates a vacuum in the cylinders which pull a very small amount of oil past the rings, increasing protection.  This, combined with the fact that the forces involved are typically less than those normally seen during acceleration lead some to conclude that it will make no real difference in the lifetime of the engine and transmission.  
There is a situation when engine braking is truly called for: going down steep hills which are also very long, and for whatever reason, it is undesirable to pull over and stop the car. Braking downhill for a long time can overheat the brakes leading to brake-fade or, in extreme cases, failure. A combination of gearing down and using the brakes is safer. But heat can be dissipated from brakes also by pulling the car over and letting it stop for a while, effectively dividing the long hill into a sequence of shorter ones.

Engine braking(for large trucks) is illegal in some cities. 

A Jake Brake modifies the characteristics of an engine with a push of a button to stop a vehicle.. 
A special modification is installed in the valve train. In short, when engaged, the force used to compress the air is used to slow the vehicle, then at a precise time, just before the piston reaches Top-Dead center, the exhaust valve is pushed open, expelling the air. On trucks with performance or no mufflers a distinctive, and sometimes painfully loud noise is made as the truck slows, and the pitch changes as the driver shifts to lower gears. 

A true engine brake.

== Change use of American terms ==

Many paragraphs use the term &quot;gas pedal&quot;, which should be replaced with more de-localised terms such as &quot;accelerator&quot; or &quot;throttle&quot;. I assume there may be more terms throughout the module. What is the stance on local (American) phrasing in WikiBooks?

== Pulling away ==

-Excuse the fact i don't have a WikiBooks account, my Wikipedia account name is Benbread if you're interested-
Anyway, looking at the pulling away part, my driving instructor told me it was always best practice to keep the handbrake engaged, bring the clutch to biting point then disengage the handbrake and pull away, particually useful if starting on a hill! Can someone possibly make this a little clearer in the article? I wont do it as i find it best to not go destroying other people's work before getting a feel for the article first. on the other hand, do others think that this pulling away method is not the most appropriate? Thanks [[User:81.79.171.143|81.79.171.143]] 23:52, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

It'll cause additional clutch wear if you do it with the handbrake. Using the the service brake system to hold it at a stop and get yourself going is safer, you can let it out gradually -- hand brake releases are typically spring-loaded ratchets, so it's a very sudden release and hard to time correctly.

As for starting on a hill, it's very common to have to hold the service brake and slowly engage the clutch to get going without sliding back. This is an especially important skill with heavier trucks and delivery vehicles, where people so commonly fail to maintain a safe following distance and there is a lack of rear visibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Skull and crossbones.svg|left|40px]] {{Warning|'''Mercury is HIGHLY toxic. Under no circumstances should children or pregnant women attempt to clean up a mercury spill'''}}

Mercury and most of its compounds are extremely toxic. Spillage requires specific cleaning procedures to avoid toxic exposure. Inhalation and contact with the skin are dangerous. If you are handling mercury in a school and you spill some you should follow your school's procedure. This will almost certainly involve immediately contacting a teacher or other member of the staff.

Under no circumstances should you try and clean up a spill with a broom or vacuum cleaner. These can cause the mercury to disperse into small droplets or become vapour - both of which are more dangerous.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Grammar ==

The conditional mood expresses the idea that the action or state expressed by the verb may or may not actually happen. As in English, the Finnish conditional is used in conditional sentences e.g.: 

*&quot;'''Minä kertoisin sinulle jos minä tietäisin'''&quot; (&quot;I would tell you if I knew&quot;)
*&quot;'''Minä tulisin jos minä voisin'''&quot; (&quot;I would come if I could&quot;)

and in polite requests e.g.:

*&quot;'''Haluaisin vähän kahvia'''&quot; (&quot;I would like some coffee&quot;)
*&quot;'''Haluaisin kuulla lisää'''&quot; (I would like to hear more&quot;)

In the former case, and unlike in English, the conditional must be used in both halves of the Finnish sentence:

&quot;ymmärtäisin jos puhuisit hitaammin&quot; = *&quot;I would understand if you would speak more slowly&quot;.

The characteristic morphology of the Finnish conditional is 'isi' inserted between the verb stem and the personal ending. This can result in a 'closed' syllable becoming 'open' and so trigger consonant gradation:

'''tiedän''' = 'I know', '''tietäisin''' = 'I would know'.

cf. '''haluan''' = 'I want', '''haluaisin''' = 'I would like'.

Conditional forms exists for both definite and indefinite voices, and for present and perfect tenses.

== Setting Up NIS Master Server ==
=== Basic Configuration ===
In Debian-based Linux distributions, three files should be modified.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
#/etc/defaultdomain
enigma
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
#/etc/default/nis
NISSERVER=master
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# /etc/yp.conf - ypbind configuration file
ypserver 127.0.0.1
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
In '''/etc/nsswitch.conf''', make sure you have '''passwd''', '''group''', '''shadow''' and '''netgroup''' entries like this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# /etc/nsswitch.conf
passwd:         compat
group:          compat
shadow:         compat
netgroup:       nis
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Starting Server Daemon ===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
root@enigma:/etc# init.d/portmap start
 * Starting portmap daemon...
   ...done.
root@enigma:/etc# init.d/nis start
Starting NIS services: ypserv yppasswdd ypxfrd ypbind 
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
On success, the following information is expected:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
root@enigma:/etc# rpcinfo -p localhost
   program vers proto   port
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100007    2   udp    717  ypbind
    100007    1   udp    717  ypbind
    100007    2   tcp    720  ypbind
    100007    1   tcp    720  ypbind
    100009    1   udp    706  yppasswdd
 600100069    1   udp    709  fypxfrd
 600100069    1   tcp    711  fypxfrd
    100004    2   udp    704  ypserv
    100004    1   udp    704  ypserv
    100004    2   tcp    708  ypserv
    100004    1   tcp    708  ypserv
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Sometimes you might not see '''ypbind''' and '''fypxfrd''' in the list. You should finish the next step and rerun the command.

=== Initializing Master Server ===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
root@enigma:/etc# /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m

At this point, we have to construct a list of the hosts which will run NIS
servers.  localhost.localdomain is in the list of NIS server hosts.  Please continue to add
the names for the other hosts, one per line.  When you are done with the
list, type a &lt;control D&gt;.
        next host to add:  localhost.localdomain
        next host to add:  
The current list of NIS servers looks like this:

localhost.localdomain

Is this correct?  [y/n: y]  y
We need a few minutes to build the databases...
Building /var/yp/enigma/ypservers...
Running /var/yp/Makefile...
make[1]: Entering directory `/var/yp/enigma'
Updating passwd.byname...
Updating passwd.byuid...
......
Updating shadow.byname...
make[1]: Leaving directory `/var/yp/enigma'

localhost.localdomain has been set up as a NIS master server.

Now you can run ypinit -s localhost.localdomain on all slave server.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Be sure to start '''portmap''' before typing this command, otherwise you will get an error and have to manually delete '''/var/yp/enigma'''.

=== Adding New Users ===
It is recommended to add groups and users by using '''addgroup''' and '''adduser''' scripts, which are able to synchronize NIS information automatically. If not, you should do this manually after adding new groups or users:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
root@enigma:/etc# cd /var/yp
root@enigma:/var/yp# make
make[1]: Entering directory `/var/yp/enigma'
Updating passwd.byname...
Updating passwd.byuid...
Updating netid.byname...
Updating shadow.byname...
make[1]: Leaving directory `/var/yp/enigma'
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
NIS clients should restart '''/etc/init.d/nis''' service in order to keep updated.

== Setting Up NIS Client ==
=== Basic Configuration ===
Like server configuration, make sure you have '''passwd''', '''group''', '''shadow''' and '''netgroup''' entries like this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# /etc/nsswitch.conf
passwd:         compat
group:          compat
shadow:         compat
netgroup:       nis
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Then configure NIS domain name and NIS server:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# /etc/defaultdomain
enigma
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# /etc/yp.conf
ypserver enigma
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Your '''/etc/hosts''' should contain a line like:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
# /etc/hosts
192.168.4.131 enigma
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Modifying Authentication Files ===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
root@nis-client:/etc# echo '+::::::' &gt;&gt; /etc/passwd
root@nis-client:/etc# echo '+::::::::' &gt;&gt; /etc/shadow
root@nis-client:/etc# echo '+:::' &gt;&gt; /etc/group
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
It is also possible to grant or restrict the access of specified users. It is a little complex and will not be discussed here. Refer to [http://lyre.mit.edu/~powell/debian-howto/nis.html Debian NIS HOWTO] if you want to know more.

=== Starting Client Daemon ===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
root@nis-client:/etc# /etc/init.d/portmap start
 * Starting portmap daemon...
   ...done.
root@nis-client:/etc# /etc/init.d/nis start
Starting NIS services: ypbind
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Security is a critical issue that almost everyone of us deals with or should. Most people surf the internet for several uses, like getting information about a topic, checking email, shopping, reading, or even selling goods. The internet has made all of these activities easier and faster to achieve with less time and effort. Still, this convenience does not come without a price. 

Internet security is a concern for everyone who uses the internet. How can you be sure that your identity, passwords, personal information, shopping information and credit card numbers, etc are all protected and that they are not available for hackers and malicious users. These are some tips that can helps with this:
* NEVER give your username and password for anyone. 
* MAKE sure you read the privacy policy of the websites that you visit before giving any personal information.
* If you are shopping online, NEVER shop from an untrusted website. If you have doubt about the website check the privacy policy of that website and any information about their method of protecting that data, if available. If you are still in doubt, then do not shop from that website and keep searching to a more trusted websites.
* Don't provide you email username and password for any websites that will enable the website to logon to your account automatically. This is a big risk that personal information through emails can be accessed.

There are also some preventive measures that you can take to prevent invasion of keyloggers (programs that record what you typed and send them off through the internet without the user noticing) and trojans onto your computer. These include: 1) Up to date antivirus programme (there are some free ones around that will do a good job, I recommend: AntiVir Guard) 2) Fire wall (yet, another free and reliable one: ZoneAlarm) 3) Anti-adware/spyware: e.g.Ad-Aware and Spybot

Having these programmes will provide you a security of your computer. Though, behaviour practises as discussed in the early part are also essential to provide good online security.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian cuisines]]

'''Papadum''' (also '''papadam''', '''poppadom''', '''papad''', and '''appalam''') is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]] [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]].  Typically, it is prepared using [[Cookbook:Urad Bean|black gram]] bean flour, [[Cookbook:Rice Flour|rice flour]], or [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentil]] flour with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]] added. The ingredients are made into a [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]] and formed into a thin, round shape similar to a [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortilla]].  As the dough is prepared, the papadum can be seasoned with a variety of different ingredients such as [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chilies]], [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], or other [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spices]].

Papadums are cooked by deep-frying in oil, which causes them to expand and crispen. They may also be cooked by roasting them over an open flame, in a toaster oven, or in a [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]].   Depending on the cooking method they may be either soft and moist or crisp in texture.

Usually served as a complement to a main dish in South Asia, a relatively recent Western practice is to treat them as a [[Cookbook:Snacks|snack]] or as an [[Cookbook:Appetizers|appetizer]] to be topped with [[Cookbook:Chutney|chutney]], various dips or [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsas]]. Commonly made in different sizes, the smaller ones are for snacks and the larger variety may be used as a food wrap. 

== Ingredients==

*8 cups [[Cookbook:Urad Bean|black gram]] flour
*1 tsp cracked [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
*1 tsp ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin seeds]]
*½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*¼ cup [[Cookbook:Water|water]] (or more if needed)
*[[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for frying

== Procedure ==

For 10 to 15 servings:

# Mix flour, pepper, cumin and salt.
# Add water and knead the dough until it is smooth. You may have to add some water, depending on the flour.
# Split the dough into 10 or 15 balls.
# Roll out one ball at a time to a very thin round layer on a slightly oiled surface.
# Dry the papadums in the oven for an hour (at about 100°C or 200°F).
# Right now you can keep them in an airtight container.
# Fry the papadums in oil until they are crispy (not too brown!).

For people interested in learning techniques on how to create paper models, here is a list of tutorials that others have created, with a description  of each and reviews of some. If you know of others, feel free to add them to the list below.

There are many tools and approaches to creating [[paper model]]s. Often, a [[3D modeler]] program is used to create an electronic version of the object, then imported into a 3D model &quot;unfolding&quot; program (such as [[Pepakura]]) that lays the design out flat, ready to be printed.

* [http://rcp.web.infoseek.co.jp/Rc_hp2/fms/Metasequoia_e.htm Modeling for FMS with Metasequoia] - This doesn't strictly address paper modeling, but it's a useful tutorial on using [http://www.metaseq.net/english/index.html Metasequoia] (a free 3D modeling tool from a Japanese developer)

Although the '''Tipitapa''' recipe is a secret, this is the most common substitute to it.

==Ingredients==
* 5 spoonfuls [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|virgin olive oil]]
* whole 8oz - 1lb (225g - 450g) [[Cookbook:Fish|carp fish]]

===Salsa===
* ½ an [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 3 oz (85g) [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* natural (fruit) [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1-2 spoonfuls virgin olive oil

==Procedure==
# Fry half a yellow onion (vidalia onions are okay but purple or white onions are also acceptable). 
# When the onion is transparent, add a 3 ounces tomato cut in rings and cook for five minutes then add a drop or two of vinegar and a pinch of brown sugar. Let it cook for a few more minutes and save.
# Use a carp fish (8 ounces to 1 pound) per serving. The fish must be fresh and the skin clean of scales but intact. The contents of the fish must be emptied (abdominal clean up). It is possible to use previously frozen fish but fresh unfrozen catch is preferable.
# In five spoonfuls of virgin olive oil (to substitute Nicaraguan virgin oils) or the same amount of your favorite cooking oil that is already heated, fry one side of the fish until the skin is crispy (approximately 7 minutes per side) then put in the oven on pan with rack to cook at 350°F (175°C) during 15 minutes.
# Let the fish cool, then salt as wanted and return to its pan. Fry again for 3 minutes each side low flame while re-heating the salsa, then add the salsa on top and serve.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are as many and varied approaches to piercing aftercare as there are reasons why people get pierced so while this article will present a few different views it is hardly comprehensive.

== General/Body Piercing Aftercare ==

''''LITHA (Leave it the hell alone)'''' – This method is exactly what it sounds like.  After you get the piercing you leave it alone.  Some people hold very strongly to the LITHA method and don’t do any type of cleaning during healing, though many people using this method will clean the piercing with them in the shower.   
 
''''SSS (Sea Salt Soaks)'''' – With this method you soak your piercing in a warm salt mixture.  The appropriate ratio for the mixture is ¼ a teaspoon of non-iodized salt in 8oz or 1 cup of water.  For this method you would do one to two soaks a day for five to ten minutes.  During the soak the piercing needs to be completely submerged in the sea salt mixture. After the soak simply rinse your piercing with warm water and pat dry.  This method works with your body’s natural salinity to push out any bacteria inside your piercing.  For this reason it’s very important to mix the solution in the right proportions.  This is also the recommended aftercare method presented by APP.  The APP also recommends the use of anti-microbial soap.  Satin and Provon are good, gentle soaps to use in conjunction with sea salt soaks.

''''Chamomile Presses'''' – This is a method similar to sea salt soaks, but better suited for some piercings.  The navel for example would be difficult to soak.  With this method you steep a plain chamomile tea bag in a mixture of ¼ teaspoon of non-iodized salt and 8oz of water.  After about five minutes you remove the tea bag and place it over your piercing, applying only enough pressure to hold it in place.  For things such a navel it might be easier to simply lie down and avoid unneeded pressure being put on your piercing.  For this method you leave the tea bag resting on the piercing for five to ten minutes before rinsing with warm water and patting dry with a clean paper towel.

== Oral Piercing Aftercare ==

All of the methods above can and should be used to heal oral piercings however there are other things that need to be done for oral piercings specifically.

''''Rinsing'''' – During the course of healing it’s important to rinse your mouth after eating, drinking or smoking.  Rinsing out with mouthwash is unnecessary and will likely lead to over cleaning unless you use alcohol free mouthwash.  Instead warm water or a salt mixture should be used.  Mouthwash can be used in the morning and at night if desired.

It’s important while healing an oral piercing to avoid using a mouth wash with alcohol in it.  There are a few options.  Crest Pro Health, Tech 200, Biotene, and Listerine Zero are all mouthwashes that don’t contain alcohol.

== Cartilage Piercing Aftercare ==

While there is little that needs to be done specifically for cartilage piercings I thought a note on patience was prudent.  These piercings are notoriously fussy and healing is long.  Stress bumps are very common with cartilage piercings.  The best means to deal with these bumps is to find the cause and try and avoid it.  Other than that, in time they will go away as the piercing heals.  So, the most important thing to remember is ''BE PATIENT''.Don't twist the piercing this only sets back the healing process about a few weeks

== General Notes ==

Never touch a healing piercing with dirty hands.

Don’t play with a healing piercing.

Do as much research on aftercare as you can ''BEFORE'' you get pierced.

Cacti are usually pretty easy to grow.  Almost all cacti are able to handle neglect and will soon grow with a little care.  Cacti adapt very easily to the dry conditions found in the home.  Some cacti can grow to be only a few inches tall but others can grow so big that they will eventually outgrow your home.   Some may grow to stand upright, or others may only grow to form a big ball, cacti are generally limited by how big their container is, these containers being hanging baskets or ornamental balls.  Cacti grow slowly as houseplants, typically only a few inches a year, the cacti will grow quickest during the months of March and September.  

You should water your cacti according to the location they are in.  If they are in a place that gets very hot, you need to water them once a week.  If they are in a place that is milder then watering them once a month would be fine.  When you do water, do so in the morning and be sure that the cacti is positioned to get a little morning sun after watering.  The cacti cannot ever be permitted to sit in water.  Soil that has been waterlogged will rot the roots of the cacti.  Cacti plants do best in a rich soil, but only if it is free-draining.  Commercial cacti potting soils can be used, or if you can make your own by putting together equal parts of a peat-based potting soil and sand or grit.
http://www.spinesandleaves.com/cactus-plant-care.html

Cacti usually prefer to be planted in a pot and should only be repotted as needed.  April is the best time to repot the cacti.  When you do repot you need to wear heavy gloves or wrap the cacti in newspaper.  Put the cacti in a container that is only a little larger than the previous container.  After you repot the cacti, you should wait several days before watering.
	
Use a low nitrogen fertilizer once a month from June to September.  You should never fertilize repotted plants during the winter.

When you get your cacti home you will want to place it in a well lit position in your home.  It needs to be able to get some direct sunlight throughout the day.  Cacti will do best in a temperature that is anywhere from 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit during the growing season.  Dormant cacti plants will do best in temperatures between 45 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit in winter.  The best place for cacti in winter is a sunny cool room or next to a window where it is cooler.  During the summer cacti can be moved outside and will adapt very well to the change of climates.  For the first weeks, place them in partial shade so they can have a chance to adjust to the brighter light.

A few types of Arid Climate Cacti are:

Star Cactus-this is easy to grow.  This is a green spineless cactus and has white flakes on the outside of the ribs.

Golden Barrel Cactus-sits upright and has a green body that is covered with gold-yellow spines.  The flowers are also gold.  This cactus would be good for beginners.

A few things to remember when caring for your cacti, if your not sure whether to water the cacti or not, then you should probably wait until the next week. The cacti will be able to handle the neglect better than the over watering.  Don’t put the cacti too close to the glass on the window, if the temperature raises above the 86 degree mark, then this could burn your cacti.  Enjoy your cacti!!!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proper wine storage is a very important thing. When one typically purchases large quantities of assorted wines, it is natural that among all other reasons, future consumption is the key. Proper wine storage can lead to a great many years of future enjoyment. Wine storage also provides time for immature vintages to develop into something special. Correct wine storage provides the wine lover the ability to collect and store large qualities of there favorite wines to be enjoyed for years to come.

When considering a large investment in wine, the wine lover must consider the method in which he stores his wine. Improper storage can damage wine and thus diminish the possibility of enjoyment. 

Chiefly, the purchaser will consider where he will store his wine. Here, he has options. Either he might store it at home or hire an outside service to store the wine for him. The wine lover must protect the wine from the elements. 

While 90% of all wine is meant to be consumed within one year, a true connoisseur and collector may wish to consider an additional investment in a wine cellar. Significant thought and planning should go into this process. These are the things that should be considered in this process.

*   Location of the wine cellar

*   Temperature of the wine cellar

*   Humidity and ventilation of the area

*   Composition of the floor

*   Lighting of the space

The location of the wine cellar is very important. When underground, it is best that it’s a room that is facing to the north. This is necessary as this wall receives the minimum amount of solar radiation during the day thus causing less retention of heat. The northern part of the perimeter of this room must not be adjacent to a road nor railway and made of stone or brick. The wine cellar must not be subject to unnecessary movement or vibrations. Vibrations can disturb and damage wine.

The wine ideally, must be stored at temperatures between 10°-14° Celsius. The wine must be kept cool. This is done by keeping the wine underground and minimizing exposure to solar radiation.

Humidity must be controlled in order to keep the cork moist and functioning. A functioning cork maintains the integrity of the wine. The humidity should be between 70-75%. This level of humidity would cause mold to form in a normal house.

A floor of earth or sand is important, as this also helps to reduce the level of vibrations in the room.

Lastly, the lighting must originate from unscented candles. Neon or fluorescent lighting cannot be considered as they kill wine. The candles used must be unscented as a scented candle will foul the wine.
Once these 5 considerations are undertaken, a new problem emerges. That is, what to stock the wine cellar with. While this question is beyond the scope of this paper, it is sincerely wished that everyone stock their cellars with all sorts of wine that they enjoy.  This is certainly the intention of the entire effort.

The lat pulldown is an excellent exercise for working the Lattissimus Dorsi.  When doing this exercise there are several things to focus on.

* Begin by sitting in an upright position with the thigh pad set snug against the thighs.  
* Next, the grip of the bar should be outside shoulder width (wide grip).
* Now grip the bar with palms pronated (facing away from you).
* Once you have the proper grip, slightly recline while maintaining the arch in your back. This allows for a better angle and better clearance during the ROM (range of motion).
* The important factor here is to maintain this angle by keeping proper posture.  NO SWINGING OF THE BODY - to help think of pulling your belly button towards your spine and continue keeping your core contracted.   This is your starting point.
* Now the most important factor when working the lats:
*: Your first motion should begin by pulling the scapula (shoulder blade) down without bending the elbows.  This first motion is so important because the movement is being initiated by the lats and  not the biceps. The biceps are only an assistant muscle during this and other back exercises.  Keep in mind  this is a very small movement - only about an inch.  You should immediately feel the lats contract  right below the arm pit area.
* Continue pulling till the bar reaches the top of the chest.  Keeping your posture, slowly raise the bar back to the beginning position and repeat.  

This may take a few times before getting familiar with the first movement occurring at the shoulder.  The reason for this is that it’s natural for the body to want the elbows to bend first which recruits the biceps much more than needed.  There is no way to eliminate the biceps; what you are trying to negotiate is the degree of assistance.  You may have experienced with using too much biceps after finishing a set and feeling the arms being fatigued and nothing in the lats.  Please keep in mind this is not always the case, however, it’s much more common than not.  So once again the two main factors to focus on are: 1. Keep your body position slightly reclined, not allowing any movement at any time; and 2. Initiate the movement with the shoulders not the elbows.

[[Image:Rcap2-1.JPG]]

== RCAP v.3 ==
== Description ==
The RCAP v.3 is a Remote Control Autopilot for model airplanes and cars. The autopilot function can be switched off or on during flight with the flick of a switch. It requires a GPS antenna, and a computer to upload the waypoint coordinates to the WPS (Waypoint Sequencer. The navigation board, connects directly to the waypoint sequencer and to the GPS antenna/module (OEM GPS).

Please come back for an updated project an information on the RCAP v.3




=='''RCAP2 Remote Control Auto Pilot'''==
[[Image:Rcap2-1.JPG]]

== Description ==
&lt;p&gt;The RCAP2 is a Remote Control AutoPilot for model airplanes, cars and boats. The autopilot function can be switched off or on during flight with the flick of a switch. For it to function, a NMEA capable GPS (with either an OEM GPS for new firmware being developed [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=993046 rcgroups thread], or with programmable goto/waypoints functions) must be connected to the serial input port of the RCAP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Wikipedia article describes what the RCAP2 is, what you can do with it, how it works and how to install it. The article is not meant to be a how-to for the RCAP2. For that information you should visit the [http://www.scalerobotics.com/store/catalog manufacturer] website of the RCAP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original RCAP was conceived by Mike Pawlowski. Mike wrote the firmware v1.1 for the RCAP, which this RCAP2 is based on. He also designed the original RCAP board, which this RCAP2 is based on. Many thanks to Mike for publishing his work as open source. His website and source code can be found on [http://rcpilot.sourceforge.net/modules/rcap/index.php sourceforge]. The RCAP2 is pin for pin compatible to the original RCAP. Some additional headers and servo ports have been added for future use. You will find them described below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RCAP2 is available from [http://www.scalerobotics.com/store/catalog Scale Robotics] in 2 flavours:
*1. Pre-built and soldered RCAP2 GPS waypoint tracking (some items need to be added by customer, see below)
*2. RCAP2 PCB kit &amp; parts for gps waypoint tracking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software/Firmware can be found [http://www.scalerobotics.com/main16.zip here], and servo.inc and other original firmware for [http://rcpilot.sourceforge.net/modules/rcap/index.php can be found here]. The source code for this project was programmed using PicBasic Pro. This software is available from [http://www.melabs.com MELabs]. PicBasic Pro is only necessary if you wish to customize the program of the RCAP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The version that is currently being sold (Nov 2007) contains bootloader functionality which makes it possible to upload new firmware to your RCAP2 by connecting the it to the serial port of your computer through a null-modem cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== How does it work ==
&lt;p&gt;Very soon I will be adding more information on how the RCAP works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Before buying ==
&lt;p&gt;Before you jump into buying the RCAP2, you have to realize that to make your UAV system complete, there are a few other items that you need to have/buy to get started. Also there are things that need to be considered before taking the plunge into RCAP2:&lt;br&gt;
* Airplane / boat / car) in which you are going to use the RCAP2
* a GPS device that is can store waypoints/routes
* Read [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rcap#Use_and_Limited_Liability Use and Limited Liability] paragraph&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Installation ==
Before you can actually use the RCAP2 there is some minor work to do. This includes soldering to the board. If you don't feel comfortable with soldering, then find someone that can help you with this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Power'''

&lt;p&gt;To power the board, I suggest you to choose a connector that mates with the connector on your powersupply (ie. batterypack). The connector can be attached to the board through wires. Soldering has to be done for powering the board and in some cases for connecting the RCAP2 to your receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solder the red wire (positive lead) coming from the connector to the pad marked with a + sign and the black wire (negative lead) to the pad marked with the '-' sign. These pads are a little hard to find. If you look at the image above, you will see 2 blue capacitors, just next to the DB9 connector. The pads can be found below the capacitor nearest to the edge of the board. You probably have to bend away the capacitor to have access to the pads. Be careful not to bend the legs of the capacitors to often or it will break and cause your board not to work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Receiver connection'''

&lt;p&gt;In the image above you see jumper J3 (enable channel) and J4 (RCAP2 to Rudder on receiver). To save weight -crucial for airborne models- some boards are sold without the jumper. If you received your board without thes jumpers you have to solder servo extension wires to the board. The servo extension cord should have a female connector on 1 side (for connecting it to, in most cases, the landing gear/flaps channel and rudder channel of your receiver). The pads that you connect ground to is the pad closest to the edge of the board. Slide the servo wire into the board from the upside and solder it on the backside of the board.&lt;/p&gt;


'''Rudder'''

&lt;p&gt;In most cases you want to use your rudder for steering from one waypoint to another. Connect your rudder servo to jumper J2 on the RCAP2 board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also connect the servo wire coming from J4 to the rudder channel of your receiver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== First use ==
Before using the RCAP2 for the first time, be assured that you have the latest firmware version.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your RCAP2 board contains a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontroller PIC Microcontroller] (type 16F876A) that contains the software that takes care of sending your model to pre-programmed waypoints. On the microcontroller you will find a label with the firmware version that is in the chip. New firmwares can be downloaded from the RCAP2 [http://www.uavs.net/rcap.html RCAP2 website], follow the link to firmware and download the latest HEX file. You also need the software to upload the HEX file to the RCAP2 board that you find on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading the firmware, use the null-modem cable to connect the RCAP2 to your computer (note: Notebooks don't work in most cases since the power they can supply through the serial ports is too low). Follow the instructions on the firmware page on how to upload the firmware to the RCAP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to set your GPS data transfer settings to NMEA/NMEA at 4800 baud. A new firmware has come available (2006-05-03) which makes it possible to work on 9600 baud, go to the firmware website to download this new version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now follow the procedure below for first use.
*1. Connect the wire coming from J3 to your receiver's landing gear or flaps channel (please take note of correct polarity) and J4 to the rudder channel on your receiver.
*2. Connect the rudder servo to jumper J2 (check polarity)
*3. Switch off landing gear (or flaps) channel of your transmitter
*4. Program a route into your GPS device by adding waypoints, when finished, switch of the GPS device
*5. Connect your GPS device through a cable to the RCAP2
*6. Switch on your transmitter
*7. Switch on your GPS device
*8. Select the goto function of your GPS device and select a waypoint.
*8. Power up your receiver (by connecting the battery to your Electronic Speed Control)
*9. Connect the RCAP2 to the powersupply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No smoke? great! You did well. Now, when the RCAP is first powered, it samples the transmitters rudder stick for neutral position. In versions previous to 1.6, it also samples the rudder position (and assumes it to be neutral) each time the autopilot is enabled. This means that you must be in neutral rudder position each time you flip to autopilot if you are using versions previous to 1.6. This is important for the autopilot to function properly.  During power up, you will see the LED light for the first 6 or so seconds after you apply power to the RCAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now verify if all controls on your model work as they are supposed to do. If something doesn't work as it is supposed to do, then check your connections and see if you followed all steps of the procedure above. Maybe you forgot something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything works correctly, you are ready to flip the landing gear (or flaps) switch on your transmitter to switch on the RCAP2 autopilot function. The LED should start to blink every 2 seconds or so. This indicates that your RCAP2 has autopilot enabled, and valid GPS data is being received through the serial port. If the LED is not blinking, then check if all the following conditions are met:&lt;br&gt;
* The GPS device is receiving good data and plugged in correctly to the RCAP2
* The GPS is set to output NMEA in/out at 4800 baud (or 9600 baud with latest firmware - see above)
* A waypoint selected and in goto mode
* All connections between receiver, and RCAP made properly
* Autopilot enabled with transmitter
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Testing your RCAP2==
&lt;p&gt;Comming soon...&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Recommendations==
&lt;p&gt;It is suggested that the RCAP2 be used only on high wing trainer type aircraft. The original RCAP website suggests that it only be used with a FMA Co-pilot type device, in order to keep your plane stable. It is unknown whether an inherently stable aircraft could be flown successfully with the RCAP2 without a flight stabilization system. The original RCAP site shows a FMA Copilot being connected to the elevator and ailerons, while the RCAP is connected to the rudder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Configuring the RCAP2 ==
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 variables to set to the RCAP2 and have it work the way you want, those are Travel, Gain and Servo direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Travel'''
&lt;p&gt;Max Servo Travel (Variable resistor R2) allows you to set a maximum end point that you will allow a servo to travel. This is especially important when installing the RCAP into an aircraft. I recommend starting with a minimal setting and increasing it slowly. For your information a max setting of travel is attained when the pot is set fully counter clockwise.The position of this pot will be looked at each time autopilot is selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Gain'''
&lt;p&gt;Course Correction Gain (Variable resistor R3) allows you to adjust how aggressively you want to RCAP to remain on course. A low setting means that the RCAP will slowly turn toward the current course. A high setting will have the turns perform much quicker. The amount of correction used is also proportional to the amount off course the vehicle is, the greater the amount off course, the greater the correction is. I would recommend starting with a minimal setting and increasing it slowly. For your information, a max setting of gain is attained when the pot is set fully counter-clockwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Servo direction'''
&lt;p&gt;Servo direction simply allows you to reverse the direction a servo turns while the RCAP autopilot mode is selected. While in radio controlled flight (autopilot off), your transmitter takes care of servo direction. The transmitter uses the settings you have done in the radio. When autopilot is on, you give control to the RCAP2 and it is not aware of any transitter settings. Before actually putting the RCAP into your vehicle your have to make sure it matches the expected response. You must test this with the GPS attached, waypoint selected, passing a waypoint position one side or the other while looking at the rudder to ensure that it is turning the proper direction to turn toward the waypoint. This switch position is looked at every time the autopilot mode is selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Custom programming==
&lt;p&gt;Programming or modifying your own code is possible as the PIC16F876A chip can be reprogrammed about 100,000 times.  The RCAP2 currently comes with version 1.6B programmed in. This version includes a small bootloader code in the firmware that allows the chip to be programed easily through the serial port. With version 1.6B no programmer will be required. If you are interested in a programmer, there are many programmers out there. Many will need a separate addapter to program a 28 pin chip. PicBasicPro  was the software tool used to  create  Main.bas  (ver 1.1 RCAP code), as well as each successive version.  This program makes it relatively easy to program a PIC chip using code similar to the Parallax Basic Stamp code. PicBasic Pro is made by [http://www.melabs.com MELabs], and can be found on their website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you have designed a useful piece of code, then we would love to hear from you about it. Please contact [http://scalerobotics.com/store/catalog/contact_us.php Scale Robotics] and let us know what you have made. We might consider to use your code in feature releases of our firmware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''Debugging'''
&lt;p&gt;Debug is a tool you can use to get information out of your PIC chip. You can use the provided code debug-main.hex to help you understand what is going on inside the RCAP2. This is not going to be available, unless you program the chip that way. it is easiest to work with the debuging port, J7. This gives you the following status while you have turned on autopilot mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Use and Limited Liability==
&lt;p&gt;You should always fly your model within visual range. Also it's very important to stay keep your model within  your transmitter's range. Never fly near the limits of your range. You may not be able to switch it out of autopilot mode, should it become necessary. The RCAP2 may generate extra electronic noise that reduces the range of your transmitter. You should fully bench test and range test your setup with a friend thoroughly before your first flights are attempted. Be sure to meet all regulations that are made by the local authorities/model assocations in your country (id. AMA, FAA and/or others). Scale Robotics Inc. shall not be held responsible for any incidental, consequential or direct damages or expenses associated with the use or misuse of its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==User tests/stories/testimonials==
&lt;p&gt;In this paragraph you will find stories or links to stories from RCAP2 customers. You will see how they have come to their setup, what obstacles they have run into, etc...&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some start up troubles, kd7ost reported about his first successful flights:&lt;/p&gt;
:''&lt;p&gt;RCAP unit test flown''&lt;/p&gt;
 
:&lt;p&gt;''Well, we didn't get much of a break but it was enough. The winds settled down to 15 mph. Jeff had the Telemaster 40 ready to go with the RCAP on its own power source. He managed to fit the Garmin geko 201 above the fuel tank so we gave it a go late in the day.''&lt;/p&gt;

:&lt;p&gt;''Jeff had also worked his FS8 receiver into the project so would have a failsafe unit to further test with. Set location as a waypoint and performed a “goto”. Fueled up and into the air, climb out to a safe altitude and first got the roll and pitch control working to satisfaction. Next, flew down wind and back towards us to engage the RCAP while observing results. We were standing at the waypoint. The plane got overhead and as soon as it passed the waypoint it started a gentle right hand turn. We watch as it slowly came around, went back down wind a fair ways and finished the turn heading right back at us. Over head again and it repeated. It was loitering at the waypoint. Jeff had the gain set to about 50 percent and that was a little light for the Telemaster. We brought it in and tweaked the gain up to about 100 percent deflection.''&lt;/p&gt;

:&lt;p&gt;''Back up and set it again. It kept in a little tighter this time. We continued to fly and were so happy watching and evaluating it that we let the fuel run out. Dead sticked in, re-fueled and back up for more. Jeff flew it off in the distance till it was a spec in the distance and shut of the transmitter to fully test the failsafe and return. Within a few minutes it was obediently overhead back into the loiter pattern. As a long time PDC-10¹ user I can say this performs just like the now retired PDC-10. Several more test’s were done trying various directions, down wind, (still up at 15 mph) up wind, cross wind etc and it came back over head every time.''&lt;/p&gt;

:&lt;p&gt;''Due to not having the time to plot a course we didn’t send it out on an autonomous flight. But that’s a function of the GPS and I know this RCAP would have flown the route and returned to loiter overhead.''&lt;/p&gt;

:&lt;p&gt;''Congratulations to [http://www.scalerobotics.com Scale Robotics]. You got a winner. We're still waiting for decent weather but I know there will be many flights to come with the unit.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;¹) The PDC-10 is an obsolete UAV product from [http://www.u-nav.com Unav].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story above originates from [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=484568&amp;pp=50 this thread] on the [http://www.rcgroups.com RC Groups] forums. In that thread the initial problems with gettng the the RCAP2 working correctly with a GPS device were discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

*Molecular mechanisms of development

==Molecular mechanisms of development==
During the second half of the 20th century the types of molecules involved in embryonic development were identified. Transcription factors are the key regulators of which genes are expressed in cells. Transcriptional control in the various differentiated cell types allows each type of cell (epithelial, muscle, neuron, etc.) to express different amounts of the possible proteins. The transcription factors are regulated by signal transduction pathways that relay signals from outside of cells to the cell nucleus. Signal transduction pathways often involve receptors, receptor ligands and enzymes such as protein kinases. One key class of genes that are differentially regulated by transcription factors in different cell types are genes for cell adhesion proteins. Cell adhesion proteins are among the key regulators of morphogenesis. Functions of these various proteins in development are often elucidated experimentally using gene knockdown techniques in embryos.

&lt;hr /&gt;

(Note: I edited the post above by marking up the language using appropriate XHTML code.)

I edited the article by adding &lt;code&gt;xml:lang&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lang&lt;/code&gt; attributes to mark the Chinese.

The article also needs some other adjustments:
* The ideographic text can be further clarified by defining the ISO&amp;#xa0;15924 script codes &lt;code&gt;Hans&lt;/code&gt; (Simplified&amp;#xa0;Chinese) or &lt;code&gt;Hant&lt;/code&gt; (Traditional&amp;#xa0;Chinese).
* QUOTATION&amp;#xa0;MARK (&quot;) characters should be switched to LEFT&amp;#xa0;DOUBLE&amp;#xa0;QUOTATION&amp;#xa0;MARK (”) and RIGHT&amp;#xa0;DOUBLE&amp;#xa0;QUOTATION&amp;#xa0;MARK (”) characters.
* The article needs to be organized into something more resembling dictionary form. That is, the Chinese and commentary need to be clearly and consistently separated.
* The article needs to use actual sentences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{MIPS Assembly Page}}

This page is going to talk about using subroutine structures in MIPS Assembly. Also, this page will talk about some of the common methods by which higher-level language constructs and subroutines are translated into MIPS assembly code. 

== Subroutine Mechanics ==

In MIPS, the general purpose registers are typically taken to be the function parameters and the function variables, as needed. Previous values of the general purpose registers are stored on the stack. At the end of a subroutine, the values of all registers stored in this manner are restored from the stack.

MIPS uses the stack to preserve these registers. The stack pointer points to the bottom of the stack, but the frame pointer points to the top of the local frame. Offsetting from the stack or frame pointers can retrieve the various saved values and function parameters, as needed.

=== Stem and Leaf ===

In the function hierarchy, a function that calls other functions is known as a '''stem''' function. A function which calls no other functions is known as a '''leaf''' function. Stem functions must save the value of '''$ra''' on the stack, so that its content is preserved across the other function calls, and so the ''called function''  can return to the ''calling function'', or its parent function.

It is important to note that a leaf function does not need to preserve the value of the '''$ra''' register because it does not call any other child function and hence its return address is preserved in '''$ra'''.

=== Stack Frame ===

A function may set up a stack frame, with the '''$sp''' register pointing to the bottom of the stack, and the '''$fp''' register pointing to the top of the stack at the start of the subroutine. In this manner, '''$fp''' will be pointing to the function's input arguments (if any are on the stack), and '''$sp''' will be pointing to the local variables for the function.

The value of '''$fp''' needs to be preserved across function calls, and stem functions need to save the value of '''$fp''' before calling a child function, and restore it from the stack after calling the child function.

The value of '''$sp''' does not need to be stored on the stack, but functions need to take care to return '''$sp''' to the value it had at the beginning of the function, before the function returns. This means that at the beginning of a subroutine, values can be pushed onto the stack, and at the end of the subroutine, all those values need to be popped right back off the stack. If this is not done correctly, it will destroy the stack frame of the parent function, and possibly cause the computer to crash.

=== Saved Registers ===

There are a number of registers that must be preserved across a subroutine call. This means that if the subroutine wants to use those registers, it must save the previous values onto the stack (or some other place), and then reload those values at the end of the function. The '''$tx''' registers are all temporary registers and do not need to be saved. Likewise, the '''$ax''' registers are all function arguments, and do not need to be saved. Thr '''$v0''' and '''$v1''' registers are both function return values, and do not need to be saved. 

The following registers do need to be preserved across a function call, and should be saved by the function if they are going to be used in the function:
;$sx:The &quot;Saved Temporary&quot; registers

This page is going to talk about programming style and code formatting techniques in MIPS Assembly. Programming style is an arbitrary construct that is dependant on the individual programmer, but this page will show some common styles anyway.

Good, consistent programming style for assembly languages in general is arguably more important than for higher-level languages, as you don't have the luxury of abstracting even the simplest of operations away.  For that reason, comments are even more important than in higher-level languages!  The necessity of dealing with the nitty-gritty means your program will grow in lines of code very quickly, and someone's going to have to read it.  Why not make their life easier?  

There are several styles and conventions one may adhere to.  Doesn't matter too much which one you use, but be consistent!</text>

== SPARC History ==
SPARC (from Scalable Processor Architecture) was developed by Sun Microsystems introduced in 1986. SPARC is a registered trademark of SPARC International, Inc., an organization established in 1989 to promote the SPARC architecture and to provide conformance testing. Implementations of the original 32-bit SPARC architecture (known as SPARC Version 8, or &quot;SPARC V8&quot;) were initially designed and used for Sun's Sun-4 workstation and server systems, replacing their earlier Sun-3 systems based on the Motorola 68000 family of processors. Later, SPARC processors were used in SMP servers produced by Sun Microsystems, Solbourne and Fujitsu, among others.  

A 64-bit version of the SPARC Architecture, SPARC V9, was published in 1994, and Sun and Fujitsu both started shipping SPARC V9 processors at the end of 1995.

SPARC International (http://sparc.org) was formed in 1989 to open up the SPARC architecture to make a larger ecosystem for the design.  The architecture is freely licenseable for a nominal fee{{citation needed|free with nominal fee?!}}.  SPARC processors have been designed and produced by several manufacturers, including Texas Instruments, Atmel, Cypress Semiconductor, and Fujitsu. As a result of SPARC International, the SPARC architecture is fully open and non-proprietary.

== SPARC Architecture ==
The SPARC is of the Reduced Instruction Set Computing ([[RISC]]) architecture. The theory is that having the bare minimum of instructions needed to complete a job, the resulting architecture is faster, as most instructions take only one clock cycle to decode, leading to rapid execution. This is in contrast to CISC machines, which have specialized variable length instructions, and can take multiple clock cycles to decode and execute.

The SPARC architecture also prefetches instructions, having the next instruction fetched while the current one is executed. This has implication for branch instructions, as the next instruction might not be executed if the branch is taken, and this must be dealt with accordingly.

== Why SPARC? ==
Being a RISC architecture, SPARC assembly is very clean and simple, while still being powerful.  This makes it easy to learn, and a good choice before learning more complicated assembly languages if needed.  Furthermore, it provides a closer look of what is going on &quot;under the hood&quot; of higher-level programming languages, and at the very least should foster an appreciation of the large amount of work being done by compilers when compiling such languages. If you don't have a SPARC computer, you can use a [[SPARC_Assembly/SPARC_Emulators|SPARC emulator]].</text>

== RISC Computers ==

== Registers ==

SPARC processors have 32 '''integer''' registers. These registers are broken down into 4 basic categories: ''globals'', ''locals'', ''inputs'', and ''outputs''. The table below shows the general breakdown:

{| border=1
|-
| Number             || Purpose || Specific name
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;%r0–%r7&lt;/tt&gt;   || Globals: accessible anywhere in a program || &lt;tt&gt;%g0–%g7&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;%r8–%r15&lt;/tt&gt;  || Outputs: used to pass values to/ obtain values from subroutines || &lt;tt&gt;%o0–%o7&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;%r16–%r23&lt;/tt&gt; || Locals: used within subroutines to manipulate data  || &lt;tt&gt;%l0–%l7&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;%r24–%r31&lt;/tt&gt; || Inputs: contain data passed to a subroutine  || &lt;tt&gt;%i0–%i7&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

Dispersed throughout these categories are several special purpose registers:

{| border=1
|-
| Name                  || Number || Purpose                             || Pseudonym
|-
| Stack pointer         || 14     || Pointer to the head of the stack.   || &lt;tt&gt;%sp/ %o6&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| Frame pointer         || 30     || Pointer to the current stack frame. || &lt;tt&gt;%fp/ %i6&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| Return address        || 31     || Return address of the subroutine.   || &lt;tt&gt;%i7&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| Called return address || 15     || Return address of the called subroutine. || &lt;tt&gt; %o7 &lt;/tt&gt;
|}

As you can see from the above tables, each register has at least two names, and some of the special purpose registers have three. Any of the available names for a given register is perfectly acceptable regardless of the usage context, and it is up to the programmer to choose which names to use at any particular time. Additionally, using the stack and frame pointer registers in a way other than which they were intended is not recommended and can cause severe functionality issues within a program.

SPARC processors also contain an array of floating-point registers and a small number of special-purpose registers.  (further description needed here)

==The Fetch and Execute Instruction Cycle ==

== Delayed Branch ==

SPARC processors are pipelined, and branching is accomplished through a technique called '''Delayed Branch Execution'''. Control Transfer Intructions (CTI) are any instruction that changes the current program counter. For instance, a jmp or call instruction are CTI instructions.

In SPARC, when a CTI instruction is executed, the jump is not handled immediately. Instead, there is a one cycle delay before the branch is executed. This means that the first instruction after the jump instruction is actually handled ''before the jump takes place''. Here is an example:

 add %r3, %r2, %r5
 jmp SetR5ToZero
 add %r4, %r5, %r2

Notice that the last instruction executes before the jump takes place, not after the subroutine returns. This first instruction after a jump is called a '''delay slot'''. It is common practice to fill the delay slot with a special operation that performs no task, called a '''no-operation''', or '''nop'''.

{{SPARC Instruction|nop}}

This instruction performs no action, and therefore we don't need to worry about what order it acts in. However, if we put a nop after every branch instruction, we will waste alot of processor cycles. Therefore, if you can, it is always good practice to try and squeeze additional instructions into the delay slot, so that we don't waste any processor cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{SPARC Assembly Page}}

== Instruction Format ==

Here is a quick-rundown of the arithmetic instruction format, when writing your SPARC code:

:''mnemonic'' %rsrcA, srcB, %rdest

The instruction mnemonic (commonly, but inaccurately, also referred to as the &quot;opcode&quot;) specifies the type of operation to be performed. rsrcA is the first operand, while srcB is the second.  rsrcA must be a register, and srcB can usually be a signed immediate (13 bit) constant ''or'' a second register.  rdest is the ''destination register'', and not all instructions have one (for example: cmp for compare).  

Note that in SPARC assembly language, instructions '''always''' read from left to right.  The left (and middle, if present) operands are ''source'' operands.  If the operation writes a result anywhere (as almost all operations do), the result is written to the rightmost operand (destination register or destination memory location).

In SPARC assembly language, the following instructions are completely valid:

 add %r3, %r4, %r5

 add %r3, 16, %r5

* The first instruction adds register 3 and register 4, and places the result in register 5.
* The second instruction adds register 3, and the number 16, and places the result in register 5.


As you can see, SPARC assembly places a % sign before each register name, while numeric literals are written normally.

'''Warning''': This syntax is backwards from Intel syntax (used in PPC chips, and some compilers).

It should also be noted that many SPARC instructions such as the logic and arithmetic instructions have a version of each instruction with &quot;cc&quot; appended to the end of the mnemonic. These instructions perform the same function as their non-&quot;cc&quot; counterpart, but also set condition codes (more on these later) that can be used to regulate branching within a program. For example, the &quot;add&quot; instruction mentioned above has a counterpart &quot;addcc&quot;, which when performing an addition sets specific condition codes that later branch instructions check when deciding whether or not to branch to another part of the program.

== Comments ==
Comments will not be read by the compiler, and are indicated with an exclamation point.  Anything following the exclamation point on that line will be ignored.  Comments help you understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. The following is a bad example of commenting:
 sub %l0, %l3, %g1  ! Subtract local register 3 from l0, and put the result in global 1.
 ! add %g1, %l4, %g1! We should add in local 4, but I'm not doing that yet
We can easily tell ''what'' we are doing;  the code says that.  The comments have told us nothing.


However this is better:
 sub %l0, %l3, %g1  ! Subtract our monthly expenses from our monthly income.
                    !    This will later be used in function _foo.
 ! add %g1, %l4, %g1! Local 4 will hold &quot;other&quot; sources of income, but we're not there yet.
Now we know what we're doing (we're figuring spare change for the month), and why we're doing it (function foo will apparently use this).  Also, note that the second line in both examples will not be executed as their instructions have been commented out (apparently to be implemented later).


Do note that many people comment almost every single line of code in assembly, due to the fact that it can sometimes be difficult to tell what's going on without useful things like variable names, complex structures, etc.

== Labels ==
Labels are indicated by placing a &quot;label_name:&quot; at some point in your code.  As labels are just areas that give the compiler addresses, they can be used for anything that's stored directly in the program:  most popularly, these are used for function jumps (via branch or call statements), or ways to reference constant variables. If it is a function, and not a jump, &quot;.global&quot; must be placed before it.  There is one special label/global, just like every language, and that is the &quot;main&quot; label, which is where the program starts.

 .global main
 main:   save %sp, -64, %sp
         mov 5, %l0
         cmp %l0, 5
         be,a end
         ta 1 ! Should NEVER happen
 end:    mov 1, %g1
         ta 0

In this program are a bunch of things that might not be understandable, but this is a full program.  It starts at the main function (defined by &quot;.global main, followed by the label).  It then copies the value &quot;5&quot; into a local register, and then compares that register to the value of &quot;5&quot;.  If they are equal, it branches to the label end, where the program then exits.

== Arithmetic Instructions ==

These are the basic operations used for addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Note that any of these arithmetic instructions may take a register or an immediate value as the '''op2''' parameter. All other parameters ('''rd''' and '''rs1''' must be registers).

{{SPARC Instruction|add}}

Adds rs1 and op2, and stores result in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|addcc}}

Same as above, except that it sets the condition codes.

{{SPARC Instruction|sub}}

subtracts op2 from rs1, and stores the difference in rd

{{SPARC Instruction|subcc}}

same as above, except that it sets the condition codes.

{{SPARC Instruction|mulcc}}

Performs a single step in the multiplication operation. Stores partial results in register Y. Complete multiplication algorithms are discussed in more detail later.

=== Extended Precision ===

These instructions account for the carry bit setting, so that large numbers (larger then the machine word) can be virtually manipulated as a single entity.

{{SPARC Instruction|addx}}

Performs extended addition (adds two operands and carry bit), and stores result in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|addxcc}}

Same as above, but sets the condition codes.

{{SPARC Instruction|subx}}

{{SPARC Instruction|tsubcctv}}

{{SPARC Instruction|taddcc}}

{{SPARC Instruction|taddcctv}}

=== Y Register === 

These operations affect the Y register.

{{SPARC Instruction|rdy}}

reads the contents of the Y register in to the rd destination register

{{SPARC Instruction|wry}}

exclusively ORs the rs1 and op2 values, and stores that result in the Y register.

== Logic Instructions ==

{{SPARC Instruction|and}}

performs the bitwise AND of rs1 and op2, and stores the result in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|andcc}}

same as above, sets the condition codes.

{{SPARC Instruction|or}}

performs the bitwise OR of rs1 and op2, and stores the result in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|orcc}}

same as above, sets the condition codes.

{{SPARC Instruction|xor}}

performs the bitwise XOR, between rs1 and op2. stores the result in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|xorcc}}

same as above, sets the condition codes. 

{{SPARC Instruction|xnor}}

performs the bitwise XNOR between rs1 and op2. puts result in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|xnorcc}}

same as above, sets condition codes. 

=== Inverted Logic Operations ===

{{SPARC Instruction|andn}}

ANDs rs1 and the bitwise inverse of op2. stores result in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|andncc}}

same as above, sets condition codes.

{{SPARC Instruction|orn}}

ORs rs1 and the bitwise inverse of op2. stores the result in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|orncc}}

same as above, sets the condition codes.

== Shift Instructions ==

{{SPARC Instruction|sll}}

performs the logical left-shift of rs1. Shift amount is according to value of op2. result is stored in rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|srl}}

performs the logical right-shift of rs1. Shift amount is the value of op2. stores the result into rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|sra}}

performs the arithmetic right-shft of rs1. shift amount is the value of op2. stores the result in rd.</text>

      <comment>/* Load Instruction Format */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{SPARC Assembly Page}}

== Instruction Format ==

This is going to be a quick primer for how to write these memory instructions. 

=== Load Instruction Format ===

Memory instructions load a value from memory, or store a value into memory. The target address is computed as the addition of a base value with an optional offset value. 

For example:

 ld [%r4 + 10], %r5

loads the register %r5 with the value in memory located at [%r4 + 10]. If %r4 contains the number 25, then the memory location read would be [25 + 10] = 35. The op2 parameter, like the arithmetic instructions can be a register or an immediate. This means that the following are both valid:

 ld [%r4 + %r3], %r5

 ld [%r4 + 100], %r5

The offset value is the number of bytes offset, not the number of machine words or halfwords. This means that to load consecutive words on a 32 bit machine, the offset needs to be incremented by 4:

 ld [%r4 + 4], %r5
 ld [%r4 + 8], %r6
 ...

Also, the offset value is optional. If the offset is omitted, the assembler will assume a value of 0. For example:

 ld [%r4], %r5

will read from location %r4, with no offset.

=== Store Instruction Format ===

Store instructions are similar to load instructions, except that the operands are reversed. This means that we have the following instruction format:

 st rd, [rs1 + op2]

All the rest of the above material applies.

== Load Instructions ==

{{SPARC Instruction|ldub}}

Loads an unsigned byte from memory into rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|ldsb}}

loads a signed byte from memory into rd. sign-extends result.

{{SPARC Instruction|lduh}}

loads an unsigned halfword from memory into rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|ldsh}}

loads a signed halfword from memory into rd. Sign extends result.

{{SPARC Instruction|ld}}

loads a machine word into rd.

{{SPARC Instruction|ldd}}

Loads a double word into 2 consecutive registers.

== Store Instructions ==

{{SPARC Instruction|stb}}

Stores a byte from register rd into memory.

{{SPARC Instruction|sth}}

stores a halfword from register rd into memory.

{{SPARC Instruction|st}}

stores a machine word from register rd into memory.

{{SPARC Instruction|std}}

stores a double value from two consecutive registers into memory.

== Swap Instruction ==

{{SPARC Instruction|swap}}

performs a simultaneous load and store operation, which effectively swaps the value in memory with the value in rd. Is formatted like a load instruction, for example:

 swap [%r3 + 4], %r5</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{SPARC Assembly Page}}

== Comparison ==

{{SPARC Instruction|cmp}}

compares two numbers (Subtraction). Sets flags.

{{SPARC Instruction|tst}}

tests two numbers (performs 'and' operation). Sets flags.

== Jump Instructions ==

{{SPARC Instruction|jmp}}

jumps to specified indirect address. stores return address in %o7.

{{SPARC Instruction|jmpl}}

Performs an unconditional, register indirect jump. Target address is provided in the first operand, and the return address is then stored into the rd operand.

 jmpl rs1, rd

If the return address is stored in %o7, this acts like a subroutine call. If the return address is stored in %g0, it acts like a subroutine return.

{{SPARC Instruction|sethi}}

Sets the highest 22 bits of the target register, sets the lowest 10 bits to zero. 

 sethi const22, rd

const22 must be a constant value, cannot be a register.

== Subroutine Instructions ==

{{SPARC Instruction|call}}

calls a subroutine. Takes a single label as a new target address. Stores the return address in %o7. cannot jump to a register indirect address.

{{SPARC Instruction|ret}}

return from a subroutine.

{{SPARC Instruction|retl}}

return from a leaf subroutine.

{{SPARC Instruction|rett}}

Return from a trap instruction, or from a register indirect control transfer.

{{SPARC Instruction|save}}

{{SPARC Instruction|restore}}

restores a saved register window.

== Branch Instructions ==

branches do not store the return address.

{{SPARC Instruction|ba}}

Branch always. an unconditional jump to the target location. d

{{SPARC Instruction|bgu}}

Same as bge and bg, except uses unsigned numbers

{{SPARC Instruction|bpos}}

branches if the number is positive.

{{SPARC Instruction|bneg}}

branches if the number is negative.

{{SPARC Instruction|bcs}}

One possible solution is to use QuickTransit from Transitive, which allows SPARC binaries to execute on Solaris/x86, Linux/x86 or Linux/Itanium systems. It can be downloaded from the Transitive Web site at: http://www.transitive.com/evaluate.  Unfortunately, IBM has acquired Transitive and is no longer selling Transitive, instead integrating it into their PowerVM product.  Whether Transitive will be available as a stand-alone emulator in the future or not is yet to be seen.


&lt;!-- ADDED BIT ABOUT QEMU links may go out of date for windows binaries as they have in the past check occasionally --&gt;

Another option is QEMU. QEMU supports several SPARC plaforms and  is capable of booting operating systems NetBSD for example which still actively supports both 32 bit and 64 SPARC. Sources for QEMU can be found at the QEMU wiki: http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page. Or install it via your native packaging system precompiled binaries of recent versions of QEMU are available for windows at this site: http://lassauge.free.fr/qemu/.</text>

This page is going to discuss the upgrades in Ultra SPARC, and will discuss some issues thereof.

The UltraSPARC processors were designed by Sun Microsystems and implement the SPARC version 9 (sparcv9) architecture. This architecture natively supports 64 bit processing by extending the virtual address space to 64 bits and widening the general purpose registers to 64 bits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Floating Point Page}}

This wikibook discusses the IEEE 754 standard concerning floating-point numbers. Beginning chapters of this book focus on newcomers to the standard, who wish to understand and make use of floating point numbers, especially in a programming project. Later chapters of this book, however, focus more on the details of implementation of the IEEE 754 standard. This way, advanced users who want more details, or users who are working to create a floating-point implementation of their own can find the information they need. This book can be used as an ancillary reference source to support other books in the computer science and engineering fields. 

Programming examples found in this book attempt to use pseudocode where possible, to prevent an over-reliance on any particular language or platform. Specific examples may utilize a single computer language or assembly language.

Prerequisites to this book include an understanding of exponents and [[Algebra]], and an understanding of binary number representation.

'''Shirmal''', also '''sheermal''', is a traditional [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] made by Muslims in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Pakistan|Pakistan]] and in the Hyderabad region of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], probably from Persian influences.

==Ingredients==

* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|plain flour]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 2 tbsp. [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] extra
* 1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ¾ cup [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
* A few [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron strands]]

==Procedure==

# Soak saffron strands in 2 tbsp. milk warmed. Keep aside.
# Sift together flour and salt, sprinkle in sugar. 
# Take in a large bowl, add melted ghee. Run in ghee with finger until evenly distributed.
# Add milk a little at a time, and knead in dough. When it forms a soft smooth lump, cover with moist cloth.
# Keep aside for 2 hours, knead, keep aside again for 2 hours. Knead again, divide into 7 parts.
# Rub saffron strands in milk to dissolve.
# Place an inverted heavy iron pan on lower shelf of oven. Keep the grill on upper rack. Preheat to 250°C (480°F).
# Use dry flour for dusting while rolling. Roll to thick round about 6&quot; in diameter. Prick with fork all over. Slap onto pan base.
# Allow to bake until brown spots appear.
# Move to grill with tongs. Dip fingers in saffron milk and splash on sheermal. Keep in oven few more seconds.
# Or, bake in traditional [[Cookbook:Tandoor|tandoor]] or in inverted [[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]].
# Remove, serve hot or wrap in slightly moist towel to collect.

Apply butter or ghee on top if desired. Serve with gravies, veggies, curds, pickles or jams.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The FTP on Solaris is not set up by default.  To set it up, do the following:

1. Login as ''root''

2. Create a new user &quot;ftp&quot; in /etc/passwd file as follows:

:ftp:x:123:1:Anonymous FTP:/export/home/ftp:/bin/true

3. Then we need to sync this file with /etc/shadow with:

:pwconv

4. Create a directory for this ftp account like this:

:mkdir /export/home/ftp

Change the ownership on this directory to:

:chown -R root:other /export/home/ftp

5. Set permissions on just created directory with 555 permission:

:chmod 555 /export/home/ftp

6. Create directory pub where the files will be uploaded and downloaded from:

:mkdir /export/home/ftp/pub

7. Change permissions on this pub directory to:

:chmod 777 /export/home/ftp/pub

8. Modify /etc/ftpd/ftpaccess file by adding the following line:

:upload /export/home/ftp  /pub  yes  ftp  other  0600  nodirs

9. Now start the ftp server. You will need to su, pfexec, or however you have Solaris setup to run this command
:inetadm -e ftp

10. Test to see if the ftp server is running
:inetadm | grep ftp

The FTP server should allow the connection and upload/download of files now by anonymous user

When anonymous user logs in, the login should be anonymous and the password is the email address. After logging in, the user should go to pub directory by invoking:

:cd pub

Then the user can add a file from his current directory by doing:

:put “filename”  		- where “filename” is the name of the file to be uploaded to the server

In order to get a file user should do:

:get “filename”

4.Using the binomial obtained, square the 1st term. 

5.Multiply the 1st and the last term 

6.square the last term

*IF THE 1ST BINOMIAL IS POSITIVE THE 2ND IS NEGATIVE THE LAST TERM OF THE 2ND BINOMIAL IS ALWAYS POSITIVE

'''FACTORING BINOMIAL'''

1.Determine the square root of the 1st term

2.Find the square root of the last term

3.copy the sign/operation of the middle term

VERIFICATION

Divide the middle by 2

'''FACTORING TRINOMIAL SQUARE'''

1.Get the Factor of the last term the factor you must get is that if you add it the 2nd term numerical coefficient will appear

'''FACTORING QUADRATIC TRINOMIAL'''

1.find the pair factor of the 1st and last term

2.formulate the 2 binomial using the pair factor

3.Verify using multiplication then add the product of O AND I ( multiply both outer and inner)</text>

'''Sydney Smith's salad dressing''' is a type of salad dressing with the following ingredients:

# [[Cookbook:anchovy|anchovies]]
# [[Cookbook:Egg|egg yolks]]
# [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]]
# [[Cookbook:olive oil|olive oil]]
# [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
# [[Cookbook:potato|potatoes]]

The recipe originated from Sydney Smith who founded the Edinburgh Review. The recipe was popular in the 19th century among American cooks. The recipe is described in a poem written by the clergyman:

 Two boiled potatoes strained through a kitchen sieve,
 Softness and smoothness to the salad give;
 Of mordant mustard take a single spoon,
 Distrust the condiment that bites too soon!
 Yet deem it not, thou man of taste, a fault
 To add a double quantity of salt.
 Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown,
 And twice with vinegar procured from town;
 True taste requires it and your poet begs
 The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs.
 Let onion's atoms lurk within the bowl
 And, scarce suspected, animate the whole,
 And lastly in the flavoured compound toss
 A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce.
 Oh, great and glorious! Oh, herbaceous meat!
 'Twould tempt the dying Anchorite to eat,
 Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul
 And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl.

== Salad or dressing? ==

It is unclear if this is a dressing or the salad? what is thsi dressing put on? {{unsigned|67.181.105.114|2007-02-20T07:35:24}

:It's a dressing. The potato is forced through a sieve and thickens the dressing. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:20, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Tortilla_patatas.jpg|right|thumb|A portion of tortilla]]
'''Tortilla de patatas''' (potato [[Cookbook:Omelette|omelette]]) is also sometimes called [[Cookbook:Tortilla espanola de patatas|Tortilla espanola de patatas]] (Spanish omelette) to differentiate it from the dish commonly known as ''tortilla francesa'' (French omelette) or just ''[[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortilla]]'', which is made only with eggs (or actually maize/corn, in the case of the Mexican tortilla). It is a very popular dish at any kind of event in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spain]] and can be served either cold or hot. It is also served as a ''[[Cookbook:Tapas|tapas]]'' dish. Although potatoes and eggs are the basic and in most cases the only ingredients of a ''tortilla de patatas'', other vegetables can also be found accompanying it such as onions and, more rarely, red peppers, chives, artichokes, ham or even chorizo, and then it is called ''tortilla paisana''.

==Ingredients==

*3 lb /1200 g [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*2 cups [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] 
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==

[[Image:Frying_potatoes.jpg|right|thumb|Frying the potato slices.]] 

Peel the potatoes and cut them into small cubes or thin round slices. Sprinkle with salt and leave any excess water to drain from them while heating the oil to around 350°F (177°C) in a large frying pan. Fry the potato chips until they are very slightly golden, although this is a matter of taste: the more golden and crisp the potatoes are, the more juicy will be the omelette. For a dryer and thicker ''tortilla'', turn the heat down and let the potatoes cook gently until tender and soft. 

Remove the potatoes from the oil and drain. Beat the eggs, add salt to taste and mix with the potato chips. Leave them to soak for 10 minutes.

Next, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a frying pan and, when it's smoking hot, add the potato and egg mixture. Use a smaller frying pan so you will get a thicker and well rounded omelette. Shake the pan to avoid the omelette sticking or burning. After a few minutes, turn the omelette over with the help of a flat lid or a large dish, and leave until golden on the other side. 
Serve hot or cold accompanied by a salad.

      <comment>[[Cookbook talk:Soul food]] moved to [[Cookbook talk:Jambalaya II]]: actual recipe</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Renaming==

I believe that renaming this category to &quot;Jambalaya&quot; would be more appropriate and succinct than its present name as &quot;Soul food.&quot; 

Doubtless, there are numerous recipes which can comprise the &quot;Soul food&quot; category&quot; - a name which emerged during the late 1960's to mid 1970's and which referred colloquially to food prepared and eaten predominately by Negroes in the United States of America, which also originated in the Southeastern United States. 

There is much information available on the dish jambalaya and it's anthropological history. If there is no commentary validating reasons against renaming, then I will procede. [[User:Kevin L. Bardon|Kevin L. Bardon]] 03:05, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

Looking through the lists of instructions, it becomes clear that multiplication and division operations are not provided in SPARC: at least not in a form that most programmers are familiar with. This page is going to discuss the algorithms used to perform multiplication and division operations in SPARC

== Overview of the Multiplication Algorithm ==

== The SPARC Implementation of the Multiplication Algorithm ==

== Overview of the Division Algorithm ==

== The SPARC Implementation of the Division Algorithm ==

== Example ==
&lt;br /&gt;
To multiply %l3 and %l4 and store in %l5:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;mov&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;%l3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;%o0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;! First operand&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;mov&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;%l4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;%o1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;! Second operand&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;call&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;.mul&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;! Result stored in %o0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;! To divide %l3 by %l4, use .div&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;! To find the remainder, use .rem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;nop&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;! Delay slot&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;mov&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;%o0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;%l5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;! Copy result to %l5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

==Spoken Old English==

===Introduction===
Old English as a language was spoken from around 450 AD to around 1100 AD in England.  Like all spoken languages, it had its dialects, and it evolved in both vocabulary and form. However, the majority of written Old English is in the West Saxon dialect, and that the dialect exemplified here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ok you have this image. You think it would look great on a Wiki page, but it's not quite perfect. Perhaps it's too dark, or too big? If only you could clean it up a bit it would look great! Have no fear. This tutorial will show you a few tricks to turn an OK image into a thing of beauty.

==Getting started==

The first thing to do is open up an image-editing program. There are several possibilities.

* '''Adobe Photoshop''': The best in the business, it has lots of plug ins, is used by professionals, but is very expensive.
* '''The Gimp''': Rapidly becoming very popular, and available for both Linux and Windows. For designing web graphics, Gimp is quite comparable to Photoshop, with the added benefit that it is free software.
* '''Corel PhotoPaint''': In price is intermediate between Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop, but much closer to Photoshop in abilities. Very configurable.
* '''Paint Shop Pro''': Used to be shareware but now is sold reasonably cheaply (compared to Photoshop). Runs on Windows machines.
* '''IrfanView''': A free, lightweight, and fast image viewer and converter. Faster than Photoshop and the Gimp for quick image optimizations, but lacks advanced editing functionality.
* '''CodedColor''': Provides less image editing functionality then Photoshop but included many useful tools like image viewing, creation of web albums, organization of pictures with keywords and annotations. 
* '''Adobe Photoshop Elements''': Comes as part of some scanner and digital camera software. Described as for the serious hobbyist, it is a compendious version of Photoshop.
* '''Microsoft Paint''': Comes with the Windows operating system. If you have a Windows machine you don't even have to bother installing it. However, it is severely limited in what it can do. (It makes a good combination together with IrfanView. Before saving, re-export by C&amp;P.)
* '''Microsoft Photo Editor''': Comes with Windows versions of Microsoft Office. If you have a Windows machine with a full installation of the ubiquitous Microsoft Office product, you don't even have to bother installing it. Though, like Paint, it is severely limited in what it can do, its limitations are different. Therefore, by alternately opening an image in one and then the other of Photo Editor and Paint, one can accomplish most common image editing tasks, at the cost of some tedium since neither program by itself has all the needed features.


For the rest of this tutorial, I will be describing how to use Paint Shop Pro to perform some simple image manipulations. {''Only because this is the program with which I am most familiar, perhaps others could add sections on how to do things in the Gimp etc.''}

==Irfanview: Resizing and cropping==
How to put image data into appropriate size.

*For the reason of filesize. This is relevant for websites, and image collections (galleries)
*For preview purpose (so called thumbnail). Irfanview allows to put thumbnails from directory content into a single image.
*For detail purpose (only a particiualar detail is interesting, or border areas contain data which is not required).
*For &quot;speedy display&quot; purpose (the more tiny a file, it quicker it shows up/travels on the internet).

*Scaling and Resampling (for filesize purpose)&lt;br&gt;It is possible to scale via HTML attribute (img height= width=). This should only be used for variation about 50 percent.&lt;br&gt;It occurs that tiny thumbnails are indeed based on 500kbyte files. Scaling should be done in a way the information remains clearly visible.&lt;br&gt;Resampling is to amplify data by interpolation. It often works for up to double size for clear sources, but does not increase the amount of information. For this reason it is important to keep a &quot;master&quot; file in lossless format and maximal resolution. Any scaling should be done directly from the master (however often it does not make a big difference).&lt;br&gt;Size needs can differ much according to display hardware (the monitor). Hence it is good practice to show a directory (tree-like structure) of thumbnails, which link to images in high resolution. If the image display is static, then choose a filesize, which is possible to display within a few seconds, preferably immediately. Try to keep internet images around 50 kbytes, and test the page display under a slow connection.
*Resizing (to emphasize details)&lt;br&gt;In general, first crop out border areas, then adjust colors, then scale the image, and in the last instance probably reduce the color depth.&lt;br&gt;This guarantees as little processing loss as possible.

&lt;b&gt;Select the Image menu.&lt;/b&gt; Then select &quot;Resize/Resample&quot;.

==Irfanview: Adjusting parameters (color, brightness etc.)==
This has the purpose of &quot;realistic&quot; appearance (by default)

Some images can be color reduced (the color depth), even with a result in increasing &quot;subjective&quot; quality.&lt;br&gt;
Others do not take color reduction well, or the filesize increases above that of JPEG.&lt;br&gt;Try to modify parameters in this sequence: First the Saturation, then Contrast, then Gamma factor, then R/G/B intensity. Adjusting Brightness easily gives unrealistic results.&lt;br&gt;It is possible to operate these factors artistically, but most likely a &quot;normal&quot; image should be archieved. This means how it would like to appear in daylight at 12pm, or under standard office light. Too bright images can disappear completely on some monitors. Generally different monitors can cause a change of 50 percent, there is never &quot;exact&quot; reproduction. In case of doubt, test the image file on different computers.

&lt;b&gt;Select the Image menu.&lt;/b&gt; Then select &quot;Enhance colors&quot;.

==Irfanview: The saving format==
JPEG has become standard. However it is a lossy format, you should always keep a master file in a lossless format.&lt;br&gt;Reduction of quality to 85, 80, even 70 does not bug most images too much. However some can become quite ugly, and require high quality.&lt;br&gt;PNG requires more storage space. However, if the color depth is reduced, below 256 and even downwards to 5 unique colors, it sometimes outperforms JPEG! It is worth trying to save in different formats, and to carefully examine the results, compare versions in different JPEG quality next to each other on the screen.

&lt;b&gt;Go to &quot;File/Save as..&lt;/b&gt;
*Remove the &quot;point and extension&quot; (if contained in the filename)
*Choose a meaningful filename, probably including number of colors, x-resolution, year, performed effect.
*Differ if it is a personal file, or if others may have to decifer the meaning years later.
*Do not save/distribute files under unchanged names produced by digital cameras (except personal pictures).
*Select the appreciate format, and control the parameters (quality), and options (transparent color etc.).

===The image is too big===
Sometimes an image is so large it dominates the page. As a general rule, images should not be more than about 300 pixels wide. The image that you see on the right would be over 500 pixels wide if it were simply to be uploaded. There are several things that can be done about a very large image. If it is a scanned image, it can be rescanned at a lower resolution. If however the image is digital it must be either resized or cropped.

====Resizing====
Select &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;mage then Res&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;ze. You then get to choose the size of the image you want. Take care when resizing. The only way to make an image smaller is to throw away some of the pixels. If the image contains text, the pixels that get thrown away are not necessarily the ones that a human being would choose. If the top few pixels of the letter ''d'' are lost it becomes an ''a''. Sometimes the only way to render readable, resized, text is to use the magnifying glass to look really close up, then pick up the correct colour with the dropper (the button that looks like a pipette), and finally select a one pixel paint brush to paint the letters in a pixel at a time.(The size of the paint brush can be adjusted from the style bar, which can be found on the &lt;u&gt;v&lt;/u&gt;iew menu).

====Cropping====
If only part of the image is needed, it can be easily cropped. Use the selection tool to select the area that is wanted (see Fig.1) then copy and paste as a new image.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

===The image is dark or the color is wrong===
If the image looks to bright or too dark it can be adjusted by clicking on color then adjust then selecting brightness/contrast. A box pops up (fig. 2) with a small window that allows you to see the effect that any changes will have. Color can be adjusted similarly by selecting red/green/blue instead of brightness/contrast.
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;

==There is a tree growing out of someone's head==

Well not literally perhaps, but often there are parts of the image that you would prefer are not there. The trouble is if you simple delete them with the eraser tool, you'll end up with a great big splodge of the background colour. What you would like to do is remove the offending tree but leave the sky alone.

===Using the clone tool to erase offending objects===
The clone tool (the button with two brushes) copies one area of the picture to another. To use it, you first right click the area you want to copy from, then left click and drag the area you want to copy to. A black cross appears on the picture to show you where you are copying from. On the picture on the right, you can see the tree is being erased by copying a portion of the sky over the tree.

'''Rugelach''' is a Jewish pastry dish with raisins, walnuts, and sometimes chocolate.

== Ingredients ==
*2 cups (260g) [[Cookbook:flour|all-purpose flour]]
*1/2 cup (65g) plus 4 teaspoons [[Cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*1 cup loosely packed golden [[Cookbook:raisin|raisin]]s, chopped
*1 1/4 cups [[Cookbook:walnut|walnut]]s (1/4 lb), finely chopped
*16 tablespoons (2 sticks) unsalted [[Cookbook:butter|butter]], softened
*8 oz. (220g) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], softened
*1 cup apricot [[Cookbook:jam|jam]] or raspberry jam
*[[Cookbook:Milk|Milk]] to brush Rugelach

== Procedure ==
#Whisk flour and salt in a medium bowl.
#Beat butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer until well combined.
#Stir in flour until the contents is the consistency of dough.
#Roll the dough into a ball and wrap in plastic; flatten into a 5x7 inch (12 x 17 cm) rectangle.
#Refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.
#Line a large shallow baking pan with parchment paper. Preheat oven to 350F. 
#Cut the chilled dough into 4 even pieces, and return all but 1 to the fridge in plastic wrap. Roll the remaining piece into a 12x8 inch (30 x 19 cm) rectangle on a floured surface with a floured rolling pin (to prevent sticking).
#Put the flattened dough on parchment paper, and then return to the fridge to chill while you repeat the flattening process on all other dough quarters.
#After you are done flattening the dough, return the last piece to the fridge.
#Whisk the 1/2 cup sugar with cinnamon in a medium bowl.
#Take one dough quarter out of the fridge and spread 1/4 cup of the jam over the dough with a spatula. Over the dough, scatter 1/4 cup of raisins and then walnuts, finally 2 tablespoons of the whisked cinnamon sugar.
#Roll the dough quarter up into a tight cylinder. Place the dough cylinder seam-side down in the baking pan and close and tuck the ends.
#Repeat the same process with the other 3 dough rectangles.
#Finish the cylinders by brushing with milk, sprinkle each with a teaspoon of sugar. Using a large knife, score the dough cylinders with 3/4 inch (2cm) deep cuts, at one inch intervals.
#Bake at 350F (180°C) for 45-50 minutes.
#Take out of the oven, cool in the pan on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Transfer cylinders to a cutting board and cut slices from the cylinders to make rugelach.

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
*Instead of using raisins, try substituting mini [[Cookbook:chocolate chips|chocolate chips]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''geometric mean''' of a set of ''N'' numbers is the ''N''th root of their product.

An alternate method for calculation of the geometric mean is to first calculate its logarithm, which is the arithmetic mean of the logs of the original numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Moving the Examples to Programming:SQL ? ==
The complete example section should be moved to Programming:SQL as it's not MySQL specific. --[[User:Lathspell|Lathspell]] 22:10, 6 September 2006 (UTC)
: I agree.  I think the focus should be on installing and using MySQL and not on the SQL language.  Let's go ahead and keep section ''3. Lanuage'' for now until SQL:Programming becomes more mature and then remove it.  Also, I think we should add a section on indexes and optomizing tables and such.  This wikibook is WAY to focused on SQL language and is only duplicating the efforts found in SQL --Nick Manley 03:06, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

== Cost ==

Why MySQL?
Cost - Free! (though not for commercial use-- Programming:PostgreSQL? is free for any use)

As far as I can tell it is free for any use.  What is not free is distributing an application that includes MySQL unless you also open source the application.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:09, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

:You're right. I changed it to &quot;though not for use in proprietary software&quot; [[User:80.202.45.37|80.202.45.37]] 10:07, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

== I would like to help ==

Sorry if this isn't the right place to offer my help. Anyway, I would like to help this project. There's a problem, thought: I'm not an english speaker, so all I write needs to be reviewed, because it may contain idiotic grammar errors. Is it acceptable?

If so: what can I do now?

--[[User:Sante Caserio|Sante Caserio]] ([[User talk:Sante Caserio|talk]]) 01:02, 30 March 2009 (UTC)

--== All in one solutions ==
It states &quot;As MySQL alone isn't enough to run a real database server,&quot; . MySQL is enough to run as a database server on it's own (it is a database server after all), but for running web application on one server then you need to install the all in one solution. 

Should I update accordingly?

==Aralín (Lesson)==
===Mgá bilang kardinál (Cardinal numbers)===
&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0 = walâ&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 = isá&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11 = labíng isá&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2 = dalawá&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12 = labindalawá&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3 = tatló&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13 = labintatló&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4 = apat&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14 = labíng apat&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5 = limá&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15 = labinlimá&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6 = anim&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16 = labíng anim&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7 = pitô&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17 = labing pitô&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8 = waló&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;18 = labing waló&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9 = siyám&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;19 = labinsiyám&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10 = sampû&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20 = dalawampû&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Tagalog has distinct words for numbers ranging from 0-10, as shown above.  To form numbers within the range of 11 and 19, the prefix ''labíng-'' (or in some cases ''labin-'', without the G) is added to the number separated by a dash (or not in some cases), as also shown above.

Numbers above 19 whose digit ends with zero use the base number (0-9) and add the suffix ''-mpû'' if the base number ends in a vowel, as shown in these examples:

*''Dalawampû'' (Twenty)
*''Limampû'' (Fifty)

If the ending letter of the base number ends with the letter &quot;O&quot;, the letter is changed to &quot;U&quot; before adding the suffix ''-mpû'', as shown in these examples:

*''Tatlumpû'' (Thirty)
*''Pitumpû'' (Seventy)
*''Walumpû'' (Eighty)

If the ending letter of the base number is a consonant, the ligature ''na'' is added and the &quot;M&quot; from the suffix ''-mpû'' is dropped, incorporating ''na'' into the suffix.  However, it is still spelled as one word, as shown in these examples:

*''Apatnapû'' (Forty)
*''Animnapû'' (Sixty)
*''Siyamnapû'' (Ninety)

Numbers above 20 whose ending digit is a digit other than zero use the base form of the number but attach a contracted form of ''at'', the Tagalog word for &quot;and&quot;, written as '''t'', and are separated by a space, as shown in these examples:

*''Apatnapú't pitô'' (Forty-seven)
*''Dalawampú't anim'' (Twenty-six)
*''Siyamnapú't siyám'' (Ninety-nine)

When numbers reach the hundreds range, the number is modified by dropping the last letter and adding the suffix ''-daán'', as shown in these examples:

*''Isandaán'' (One hundred)
*''Limandaán'' (Five hundred)

There are exceptions, however.  With numbers whose base number ends with &quot;O&quot;, the &quot;O&quot; changes to a &quot;U&quot; before adding the suffix ''-daan'', as shown in these examples:

*''Tatlundaán'' (Three hundred)
*''Pitundaán'' (Seven hundred)
*''Walundaán'' (Eight hundred)

In numbers whose base number ends with a consonant, the ligature ''na'' is added before the suffix.  However, the suffix ''-daán'' changes to ''-raán'', as shown in these examples:

*''Apatnaraán'' (Four hundred)
*''Animnaraán'' (Six hundred)
*''Siyamnaraán'' (Nine hundred)

For counting thousands, use the word ''libo'', meaning &quot;thousand&quot;.

*''Isáng libo'' (One thousand)
*''Tatlumpúng libo't apatnaraán at dalawá'' (Thirty thousand four hundred two)

For counting millions, use the word ''milyón'', meaning &quot;million&quot;.

* ''Isáng milyón'' (One million)
* ''Apat na milyó't tatlundaá't labíng-anim na libo't siyamnaraán at limá'' (Four million three hundred sixteen thousand nine hundred five)

===Mgá bilang ordinál (Ordinal numbers)===
Except for the number 1, Tagalog ordinals are made by adding the prefix ''ika-'' to the number in most cases, as shown in these examples:

*''Ika-apat'' (Fourth)
*''Ika-limá'' (Fifth)
*''Ika-pitô'' (Seventh)
*''Ika-waló'' (Eighth)

There are cases in which the first two letters of the base number are removed before adding the prefix ''-ika'', as shown in these examples:

*''Ikalawá'' (Second)
*''Ikatló'' (Third)

You can also substitute the prefix pang- to indicate ordinality, examples:

*''Pangalawá'' (Second)
*''Pangatló'' (Third)

The number 1 is a special case, as it is written as ''una'', taken from Spanish.

For numbers ranging above ten, the ''ika-'' prefix is applied to the number in the same way that it is done regularly, as shown in these examples below:

*''Ika-labíng apat'' (Fourteenth)
*''Ika-dalawampú't siyám'' (Twenty-ninth)
*''Ika-walumpú't waló'' (Eighty-eighth)

===Mgá bilang Espanyól (Spanish numbers)===
In certain situations, such as the numbering of buildings or places and financial transactions, Spanish numbers are used instead of Tagalog ones.

&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0 = sero&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1 = uno&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11 = onse&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2 = dos&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;12 = dose&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3 = tres&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;13 = trese&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4 = kuwatro&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14 = katorse&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5 = singko&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;15 = kinse&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6 = sais&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16 = disisais&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7 = siyete&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17 = disisiyete&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8 = otso&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;18 = disiotso&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9 = nuwebe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;19 = disinuwebe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10 = diyes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20 = bente&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This page is going to discuss what exactly programmable hardware is.

== VLSI ==

VLSI stands for &quot;Very-Large-Scale Integration&quot;, and is the term for a number of different chip architectures that are integrated (many components on a single chip), and are usable for a variety of different purposes. Some more modern chips are refered to as ULSI (U = &quot;Ultra&quot;), but VLSI and ULSI are essentially the same thing.

VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) refers to integrated circuits with over approximately one hundred thousand transistors.  Currently chips with many millions of transistors are sometimes referred to as ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration), however the complexity of the designs are approximately the same as VLSI.

This page is going to discuss the design process for working with programmable logic devices.

== Design Flow ==

Let's talk about the basic flow involved in developing a VLSI chip.  Generally this flow is slightly cyclical in nature due to the practicalities of developing a product. Often specifications have to be revisited and reworked throughout the lifetime of a development project which impacts each of the other steps further down the flow.


== VLSI Chip Flow ==

See [[Chip Design Made Easy#VLSI Design Flow]].

== Requirements Gathering ==

Products are conceptualized by engineers and sales people who are looking to address a particular market need.  They take into account the number of sales, the cost of the product, other products in the market, the company's own line of products, the resources available to the product and many other factors.  In fields such as ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), the engineers often work with potential customers to address their needs.

From this investigation, they come up with the basic requirements of the chip.  This will include:
*the packages that the chip will be produced for.  
*The power requirements of the chip.
*The speed of the chip.
*Plans for derivatives.
*Requirements for prototyping and samples to send to customers.

Once the requirements are developed, the designers can create the functional specifications for the product. While in theory, functional specifications can be abstract descriptions of the behaviour of the chip, most customers understand beyond just the behavioural level and generally the functional specifications have at least a top level architecture of how the chip is put together.

For VLSI designs, the actual circuit is often built up from existing submodules.  For instance, a platform may combine a processor, memory cache, and a bus interface unit.  Peripherals and on-board memory can be added. PLLs (phase locked loop circuits) are often placed on the silicon to provide the fast frequencies available nowdays.  The functional specification often describes how the various blocks are interconnected and how they will function together. They also describe how the product will interact with connections on the pins.

== Establishing a structure ==

Once the functional specifications have be defined, design engineers can begin to fill out the basic architecture of the chip.  A HDL (hardware description language) such as Verilog or VHDL is usually used both in the high level conceptual designs and later at the gate-level. At the architectural level, a stub HDL file can describe the module's ports. We can instantiate these stubs in a chip level connection HDL file, in the same way that objects can be instantiated in a object oriented computer program, to define the interconnections between all the modules.

== Creating a behavioural model ==

For each module, we can write a behavioural model in a HDL.  HDLs can be written much like a computer program.  This allows the designer to experiment with the intended behaviour of the module.  Simulators can interpret the  HDL and show how it interacts with various stimulus.  The stimulus can also be written in a HDL or other language.  The testbench that is created for testing this module can often be used later on in the design flow on lower level descriptions of the design.

The behavioural models for each module can be used with the top level structural file to imitate the behaviour of the chip in simulation.  As the logic design for a module is created, we can replace the behavioural models with RTL and verify the chip's behaviour conforms to the specifications.

== Verifying behaviour ==

Functional verification is the process of testing models to determine whether they perform as functionally specified.   Tests written to use the testbench can be written by verification engineers to determine whether the behavioural model performs to the specifications created during requirements gathering.  A great deal of effort is usually assigned to verifying that the models behave as specified.

At the module level, this is called unit level functional verification. Module designs would need to pass all their functional verification tests before they could be used in a chip level design.  It is important that the functional tests cover all the possible functional uses of a module.  These tests can often be reused on other models of the design such as RTL and gate level models.</text>

== What This Book is About ==

This book is about programming SPARC Assembly language. This book will cover basics of the assembly language (instructions, syntax, etc), but will also discuss more advanced topics as well. In short, this book is attempting to be a complete SPARC reference, for readers of all skill levels.

''(This introduction needs to specify which version of the SPARC Architecture for which it is describing SPARC assembly language -- SPARC V8 (32-bit) or SPARC V9 (64-bit).)
''

== Who This Book is For ==

Because this book contains both low-level information, as well as deeper advanced material, this book is for people of all skill levels. Beginners to SPARC will find this to be an excellent introduction and teaching aide to the language. Advanced users will (hopefully) find this to be a valuable quick reference. Readers are assumed to have at least some background in assembly language programming, but it is not strictly required.

== How This Book is Organized ==

This book is ordered according to ascending skillset. That is, the easiest material is presented first, and the more advanced material is presented towards the end. Beginners, and people who are only looking to learn the basics of SPARC assembly need only read the first 2 sections. Later sections are targeted towards people who are doing advanced projects in SPARC, such as the creation of operating system kernels, and SPARC Assemblers. 

== Where to Go From Here ==

This book attempts to be a complete reference to SPARC programming. As such, there are no wikimedia projects (actual or planned) that will continue the discussion of this material any further. However, the reader may benefit from some of the other materials available, such as the other assembly languages discussed, and the various high-level languages with entire books devoted to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Preferred values are a series of numbers between a power of ten and the next, each of which has a fixed ratio with the previous number. For more information, see the section in [[Practical_Electronics/Resistors#Preferred Values|resistors]]. Commonly, the E12 is used for resistors, and the E6 series is used for capacitors, although if you use more accurate components, different systems may be used.

The E-series of preferred values are as follows:

 E6  ( 20%):  10      15      22      33      47      68

Is there no way to get the accents and breathings involved?  After all, eimi with neither an accent nor a breathing could either mean &quot;I am&quot; or &quot;I go.&quot;

does entering the diacritics with an Ancient Greek layout not work?  εἶμι



Also, there's a good reference for all the various noun and verb paradigms here:

This page is going to discuss SPARC Pseudo-Ops.

== Pseudo-Ops ==

In addition to the SPARC instructions and synthetic instructions, there are a number of assembler-provided &quot;Pseudo-Ops&quot; that create convenience for the programmer.

*.ascii
*.asciz
*.text
*.data
*.bss
*.skip
*.align
*.byte
*.half
*.word
*.single
*.double
*.quad
*.global
*.common
*.empty

This chapter will (hopefully) discuss each of these.</text>

== Synthetic Instructions ==

The SPARC Instruction set leaves out a number of conveniences that programmers have grown accustomed to. To fill in these gaps, SPARC assemblers implement a set of '''Synthetic Instructions'''. These Synthetic Instructions use the existing SPARC instructions to perform additional tasks. Some of these Synthetic Instructions have already been listed in the sections about the instructions, but for completeness, we are going to list the operations that are Synthetic Instructions here.

When Perl was initially developed there was no support at all for Object Orientated (OO) programming. Since Perl 5 OO has been added using the concept of Perl packages (namespaces), an operator called bless, some magic variables (@ISA, AUTOLOAD, UNIVERSAL), the &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and some strong conventions for supporting inheritance and encapsulation.

An object is created using the &lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt; keyword. All subroutines declared in that package become object or class methods.

A class instance is created by calling a constructor method which must be provided by the class, by convention this method is called new()

Let's see this constructor.

 package Object;
 
 sub new {
   return bless {}, shift;
 }
 
 sub setA {
   my $self = shift;
   my $a = shift;
   $self-&gt;{a}=$a;
 }
 
 sub getA {
   my $self = shift;
   return $self-&gt;{a};
 }

Client code can use this class something like this.

 my $o = Object-&gt;new;
 $o-&gt;setA(10);
 print $o-&gt;getA;

This code prints 10.

Let's look at the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; contructor in a little more detail:

The first thing is that when a subroutine is called using the -&gt; notation a new argument is pre-pended to the argument list. It is a string with either the name of the Package or a reference to the object (Object-&gt;new() or $o-&gt;setA. Until that makes sense you will find OO in Perl very confusing.

To use private variables in objects and have variables names check, you can use a little different approach to create objects.

 package my_class;
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 {
   # All code is enclosed in block context
 
   my %bar;  # All vars are declared as hashes
   sub new {
     my $class = shift;
     my $this = \do{ my $scalar }; # object is a reference to scalar (inside out object)
     bless $this, $class;
     return $this;
   }
 
   sub set_bar {
     my $this = shift;
     $bar{$this} = shift;
   }
 
   sub get_bar {
     my $this = shift;
     return $bar{$this};
   }
 }

Now you have good encapsulation - you cannot access object variables directly via $o-&gt;{bar} but only using set/get methods. It's also impossible to make mistakes in object variable names, because they are not a hash-keys but normal perl variables, needed to be declared.

We use them the same way like hash-blessed objects:

 my $o = my_class-&gt;new();
 $o-&gt;set_bar(10);
 print $o-&gt;get_bar();

prints 10

The breadboard (also called a protoboard) is used to create circuits without [[../Soldering|soldering]] components together.  The pins are connected vertically along the grey and red lines and horizontally in the sections in between.  Note that they do not connect across the gap in the center.

Danke schon!

I'm having real trouble with bookshelves: There seems to be no ''help'' that describes how they function. How do they work?

PS '''it's''' is short for '''it is'''. It's a tricky bit of English and one of its most common mis-spellings.

== [[A-level Applied Science]] pages ==

Hi, Ewen, and thank you for contributing to this book. What do you intend to have on the pages:
* [[A-level Applied Science/Colour Chemistry]],
* [[A-level Applied Science/Colour Chemistry Fibres]], and
* [[A-level Applied Science/Colour Chemistry Cellulose Fibres]]?
Some of these pages are not linked anywhere, so they will be lost. You can move them to follow the book's [[WB:NP|naming convention]] using the &quot;move&quot; tab at the top of each page or mark them for deletion by typing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|Reason}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; on each page. By the way, pages can be copied from Wikipedia, but the copier should use them as a base for a textbook or chapter instead of directly copying them. If you have any questions or would like some help, please say so on this page. Thanks, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 01:13, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

This page is going to be deleted as it uses non-free (noncommercial) content. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:32, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

:Hi Ewen. It was deleted because of the licencing used by the original document, which restricts its use to non-commercial applications only. Wikibooks is under the GFDL, meaning that anything here can be used for any reason, including commercial uses. Since the copyright on that document restricts this, it is a violation of their copyright to put it here under the GFDL, which ''does'' allow commercial uses such as printing out and selling the book to which that chapter belongs. 

:Does that answer your question? (BTW, Derbeth was the one who marked it for deletion... I'm the one who deleted it). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:20, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

::I asked around, but no dice. The only options are to rewrite from scratch not using that document, or to ask [http://www.elecuter.co.uk/Scinet/chemistry/cd/dyes.php the original authors] to relicence under GFDL. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:58, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, it answers the question, but begs a further one: Is two hours a reasonable time to allow between warning a user of an impending deletion and removing his work? It's not as if the copyright breach was flagrant and deliberate; I didn't realise that the GFDL was actually 'more' restrictive the the originators' license.

:I have asked the originators of the material if they would be willing to waive the non-commercial clause of their copyright. Failing that, I can edit the article so it does not breach their copyright. Of course, this would be much easier if I had a copy of the page to edit, which I don't since it has been deleted.

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 15:03, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, I wish I could be more helpful there, but when I asked &quot;the experts&quot;, they said no undeleting is allowed. The listing for delete was for &quot;speedy delete&quot; (which applies to any page that's obvious copyvio), which means it should be deleted by the next available admin. 

::If you are able to use irc, you might try asking on the commons channel on freenode (#wikimedia-commons), they're really the &quot;experts&quot; on this kind of thing. I might be able to &quot;userify&quot; it temporarily (i.e., put in [[User:Ewen/sandbox]]), but I'm not sure of the legal details on doing that (you might want to ask Derbeth about that option, too). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:33, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

You could e-mail it to me at e.mclaughlin(at)swancoll.ac.uk

It would be a real pain to have to re-write the whole article: Most of it was my own work! Please can I have it back?

Was speedy deletion justified? The copyright breach was not 'obvious' to ''me'' or I would not have posted it. Perhaps my mistake was to credit them at all - if I hadn't been honest enough to post the acknowledgement then who would have spotted it? I checked their license and it seemed very generous; the technical issue about GFDL allowing commercial use and them excluding it was easily overlooked by a new, enthusiastic author (who today became a bit less new and a lot less enthusiastic).

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 15:44, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

I must say this would have been much simpler if you hadn't rushed into speedy deletion - I'd have found the problem this morning and corrected it hours ago.

:I noticed youre moved the Acetone Peroxide synthesis from the org. chem book. Frankly, I was thinking it was out of place, at least in terms of the book's TOC. It just kind of stood out there as the lone synthesis in the book's TOC. And obviously, your concerns were well founded. This books should not be about how to blow yourself up. It should be about the fundamentals of organic chemistry. I hope to be doing a lot of work on this book over the next few months. I'm glad there's someone else out there who's looking at it as well. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:30, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== Can we work together? ==

Ewen, I'm very unhappy with your attitude. I feel you've insulted me numerous times and think you have not done as much as you could to engage in a calm, rational debate on issues where we disagree. Whiteknight just commented on [[Talk:Chemical synthesis]] giving a few pointers but mainly put this in our hands. SB Johnny might still add something to this, but I suppose he'll agree with WK's suggesion to &quot;''either try to work together, or try to work far apart.''&quot; I'm willing to do either, but if the former, I think some things have to change.

Let me know, --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:17, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

: Swift, I'm extremely concerned about your intentions. I think you have yet to answer, 'Why have you chosen these particular syntheses?' I find it very hard to assume good faith in the light of your choice of topics, and you have not reassured me.

: I feel you've ignored the points I have made and seem unconcerned that you are publishing information and that either has been or can be used for acts of terrorism. I make no apology if the strength of my feelings pervade my comments. I have tried to keep it rational and my contempt is not for you, but for the material posted.

: I shall be editing the syntheses to base them on laboratory grade chemicals instead of Wal-Mart grade. That would be a positive step, wouldn't it? [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 07:20, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

:: If you have any concerns, you should have approached me directly from the start instead of assuming that I had ill intent. You have treated me with disrespect and that has been detrimental to discussion. I don't feel we can continue unless you acknolege your part in this and change your ways.

:: &quot;''I find it very hard to assume good faith in the light of your choice of topics''. If you look at the work I've done on Wikibooks, you'll find that the CS book is but a tiny part of that. That said, you don't have a choice. You ''have'' to assume good faith. In this case it would have served you &amp;mdash; not to mention this discussion &amp;mdash; well.
:: &quot;''I feel you've ignored the points I have made''&quot;. I'm sorry if you feel that way. I think I've addressed all your concerns and am willing to continue the discussion &amp;mdash; but only if the debate rises to a slightly higher level.
:: &quot;''unconcerned that you are publishing information and that either has been or can be used for acts of terrorism.''&quot; Here, you are right. I'm not conserned. Oddly, you should know why since you have already stated it yourself: this information is available elsewhere.
:: &quot;''I make no apology if the strength of my feelings pervade my comments.''&quot; Then back off from Wikibooks. You are required to be civil. I don't think you have so far and your feelings don't justify insulting others.
:: &quot;''my contempt is not for you, but for the material posted.''&quot; Actually,
::* &quot;''and an apparent desire on the part of the authors to list only syntheses of the most dangerous chemicals possible.''&quot;[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chemical_synthesis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=651100]

== Changes to Organic Chemistry textbook structure ==

Ewen,

Just a quick note. This morning I did a bit of reorganization of the Organic Chem textbook. The major change was renaming the Alkanes and Cycloalkanes section to simply be Alkanes. I am currently working on the Cycloalkanes section. There is still a subsection under alkanes called Cycloalkanes and it has some very basic information that I think is relevant to keep in that location as sort of a &quot;preview&quot; of cycloalkanes.

There were a great number of links to fix and other pages to change with respect to this move. I moved all the subsection pages accordingly and all their links. It's quite possible I missed something, though I tried to be thorough. If you see anything out of place, let me know. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 20:05, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

:I've not had time to have a look yet, Pete; but thanks for the work! If I spot anything trivial I'll sort it myself but I'll check anything major with you first. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 20:26, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

::Of course, feel free to do whatever you want. I just offer because if I screwed it up, I'm happy to fix it...  On another topic, and of course, this is totally optional, I've created a link to an author's [[Organic_Chemistry/To-Do_List|To-Do list]] at the top of the [[Organic_Chemistry/Book_outline|outline page]]. I'm just using it to keep track of the things I'm working on that need to be done. As I come across sections that need work, but I may be in the middle of something else, I'll add those as well.  You're welcome to use it for yourself or not. If you want, you can just periodically check it to see what plans, if any, I have... I just think of stuff faster than I actually do it all, so instead of having to think it up again later, I'm just going to add it there and, as it gets longer (which it surely will), I'll probably start prioritizing my stuff. The idea, though, is just for each author to carve out a section of the page for their own stuff. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 22:38, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

== Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination reactions ==

Ewen, I noticed you touched the elimination stuff in Haloalkanes. I've been trying to figure how to do this and here's my thought. I did a lot of work on the Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination reaction stuff under Introduction to Reactions, and I'm thinking we ought to just merge it all into the Haloalkanes page. It seems like the right place to introduce them, even though the mechanisms are used in some non-haloalkane situations (dehydration of alcohols, for example). The existing substitution and elimination stuff in that chapter is pretty thin and it seems weird to have the substitution and elimination stuff in the back of the book. There's still some work to do on them, particularly for elimination, but it's much more thorough than what's on the Haloalkanes page. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:03, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== Images in alcohols ==

While you were fixing the images in alcohols, I was posting a question in the help desk asking why my images weren't being resized properly. Then I went back to the page and they were fine and it took me a sec to figure out what happened. lol. Thanks for fixing them. I see what I was doing wrong now. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 20:19, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

:Did you see how many attempts it took me to get them right? 8-) [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 20:24, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
::lol. I saw a long list of edits. I tried a few things in preview and couldn't get it to work. I had even found the help page in the mediawiki manual and was trying to duplicate it from stuff they had in there and couldn't figure it out, which is why I went and posted at the help desk. Funny that you stumbled across it right after I posted it. I need to do the alcohol syntheses via reduction as well and then I'll fill in the text with an actual description of each of the reactions. Really, one of the most time consuming parts of this book is doing all the damn drawings, but you really can't skimp on them in an organic chem text. We ought to resize some of those older images that are just huge. I mean, a molecule with 5 or 6 atoms taking up half the screen is just a little excessive. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 21:04, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

:::What do you use for images? I use GIMP for the final image. Chemsketch and Chime for molecules in 3D. Yup, it's time-consuming but then it's an image everyone can use; well everyone who wants to illustrate Grignard reagents reating with ketones... You search wikimedia commons, right? Some categorising work there would help us find things... [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 21:08, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

::::I use ChemDraw for non-3D stuff and Chem3D for 3D renderings and then Photoshop to clean up. I haven't tried Chemsketch and haven't used Chime either. Chime is kinda like JMol, isn't it? One thing I like about both ChemDraw and Chem3D is the ability to create a molecule from its name or to draw the molecule and have it tell me the name. For big molecules, that comes in really handy.
::::I haven't been categorizing my uploads to commons. I've been planning on going back through all my uploads and categorizing them at some point. I generally go through and look for existing ones but I've had limited success finding things in a format that I want it. Like getting the bubble molecules instead of a ball and stick or getting ball and stick when I want Kekule. I'm sure eventually it'll have a great collection.
::::Part of the problem is, sometimes, I want to show several images together instead of having to have several images side by side. For example, most of the images on the [[Organic_Chemistry/Cycloalkanes|cycloalkanes]] page. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 21:30, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== Electrostatic potential maps ==

Ewen, do you have any software to calculate and draw electrostatic potential maps of molecules? I found gOpenMol which is supposed to be able to do it, but I can't figure out how. Frankly, I hate most XWindows based apps. The UIs are just too damn hard to navigate. It's ported to Windows, but it works like an XWindows app. Still looking around for other software to do it. But stuff that can produce plots like  [http://ocw.mit.edu/NR/rdonlyres/Chemistry/5-12Spring-2005/468BE5C9-2257-4310-860B-BCB3410504CB/0/chp_carbanions.jpg this] would be fantastic. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 15:30, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

Well, Chime kinda does the job. Its methods are dodgy but frankly, if it looks good who cares? What molecules are you after? [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 15:39, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

:Ewen, my bad. Turns out Chem3D does it. I was just didn't realize it... It's really slow, but it seems to work. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:30, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

::I can't quite figure out the electrostatic potential maps in Chem3D. It's producing red, white, and blue rendererings with red at the more electronegative areas and blue at the less electronegative areas and white where things are neutral. I know it can do the red, green, and blue that's more standard, but I'm just not sure how. Might have to ask around a bit. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 14:18, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Ewen, I've spent the past several hours futzing with MEPs for a few hours yesterday and a few hours today and I'm getting very frustrated. The ones in Chime appear to be very low resolution (very pixelated). The ones in Chem3D are red, white, and blue and that just seems kind of non-standard. gOpenMole crashes on me every time I try to display MEPs in it, after going through about 2 hours of creating all the stupid damn data files it needed for them, so I've given up with that. Why can't there just be a simple way to do this? People are doing them all over their books these days, and they look really nice. How are they doing it? -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 18:39, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

::::Ewen, man, I've just been struggling with all this, but here's where things are at the moment. SpartanModel came with one of my textbooks. It has a bunch of molecules with pre-calculated MEPs and they look nice, so that'll probably work for now. So far every semi-popular molecule I've come up with has been covered (my first query was for p-chloroaniline and it came right up). There might be one or two thousand of them in there. Anyway, that should be enough to get good samples for the text. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 21:15, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

I just kind of assumed that if the page is long and there's a TOC at the top, then that's okay, but I just don't know what the standard is on Wikibooks. I don't care of the deeper linking of the old layout where everything is broken up into small subsections. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]]

::::::A warning pops up when the page length exceeds (I think) 42 kB. Some browsers have problems with longer pages. I agree that the fragmented style is not the way to go, and I intend fixing some sections such as alkynes to put the whole content on one page.

== Chemistry Book ==

Ewen,

Thanks for the note regarding the discussion. Actually, I happened upon the discussion before I read your note... Over the holidays I was busy with family and then returned to school and things have just been insanely busy this semester. I'm working full-time (40-50hrs/week), taking 16 hours of classes and working 8+ hours in a lab. That hasn't left much time to work on the book, but I'm going to try to do a bit today and maybe I can find a little time on weekends to pitch in. My schedule should ease up a bit over the summer, but until then, I'm just not going to have a great deal of time to work on the book. I'm glad to know you've been keeping an eye on it and showing some presence there.

== Hey there ==

Hi!

I'm not very active here, you'll find me far more involved on En Wikipedia, but I just dropped by today and I must say - fantastic work!

I had contributed a bit on Alkenes and other bits and pieces. From what the pages were and what they are now, I am amazed. I have real life commitments which eat at my time, but I'll be free from June. I'm looking forward to working with the all the editors here, its phenomenal how the pages are shaping up!

Keep at it,

Hi there, Ewen.

I notice that you said you received an email from the copyright holder for this material? Would you please forward that to our [[m:OTRS|OTRS team]] at {{email|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}} so they can verify &amp; archive it? We do this to protect the copyright holder.

As a scientist, I'm quite interested in [[Bad Science|this issue]], so I'll be very interested to see this work evolve. However, I think some of this is not particularly [[WB:WIW|textbook-like]]. I can expand on what I mean by that if you like, but that is perhaps something to give some thought to as you continue working on this book.

I have created a new book called [[Semiconductors]], which aims to be a general reference and discussion of all things semiconductor-related. I would like to merge in the book you started, [[Solid State Physics]]. I have alot of time to work on my new book, and your book hasn't progressed much since it was started.

I am doing a large amount of editing recently on the Electromagnetics section of the [[Modern Physics]] book, and I just wanted to alert you of a few things. First, I am reworking some pages that you have contributed to, and I am removing your signatures from the bottoms of pages that you authored. I don't mean this as a sign of disrespect, I just don't think it is appropriate to be signing the module pages. Your name and contribution history will still be shown in the History pages, and you can feel free to leave an &quot;I wrote this&quot; message on the talk pages of those modules, should you feel so inclined. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:50, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Semiconductors/Page}}
'''Semiconductors''' are materials that have properties in between normal '''[[w:Conductor|conductors]]''' (materials that allow electric current to pass, e.g. aluminium) and '''[[w:Insulator|insulators]]''' (which block electric current, e.g. sulphur).

Semiconductors fall into two broad categories. First, there are '''intrinsic''' semiconductors. These are composed of only one kind of material. [[w:Silicon|Silicon]] and [[w:Germanium|germanium]] are two examples. They are also called &quot;undoped semiconductors&quot; or &quot;i-type semiconductors&quot;.

'''Extrinsic''' semiconductors are made of intrinsic semiconductors that have had other substances added to them to alter their properties.

==Intrinsic Semiconductors==

Every atom consists of a nucleus surrounded by a number of electrons. Only the electrons are involved in electronic processes. The electrons can exist only in certain '''electron shells''' around the atom. There are many shells in each atom.

It requires energy to get an electron from a shell close to the nucleus to one further away, and if an atom's electrons are in a position which is not the position with least energy (i.e. they are in a higher (further from nucleus) shell and there is space in a lower shell), energy is given up so the electrons &quot;fall&quot; into the inner shells. Thereby, the shells closest to the nucleus are filled first, and then the next closest and so on. It requires more energy for an electron in a shell that is close to its nucleus to fill an outer shell than it is for an electron on an outer shell to fill an inner shell, so the inner shell is filled first.

We will consider our material to be arranged in a '''lattice''', which is a regular arrangement, like a crystal. This helps to describe and explain the principles. In the lattice, each electron can &quot;see&quot; every atom in the entire lattice, and therefore is not just affected by the presence of electrons in its own atom, but by all the other atoms in the material. The huge number of atoms (usually greater than one thousand billion billion in a cube 1mm on a side) means that the number of electrons in each shell of each atom is not important - the shells &quot;merge&quot; into '''bands'''. All that matters is that if that band is filled, partially filled or empty. The size of bands and the gaps between them is determined by the nature of the material.

[[Image:Energy band diagram.svg|right|frame|Figure 2: Electronic band structure of an insulator or semiconductor.]] 
[[Image:Band gap comparison.svg|right|frame|Figure 3: Comparison of the band gaps for a metal, a semiconductor and an insulator.]]

In a lattice, there will be a set of filled bands, with a full complement of electrons and unfilled bands which have no electrons (because they are in the lower-energy filled bands). The highest energy band with electrons in it is called the '''valence band''', from the chemists' term &quot;valence electrons&quot; which are the electrons on the outermost shell of the atom which are responsible for chemical reactions. The '''conduction band''' is the band above the valence band. Electrons in the conduction band are free to move about in the lattice, and can therefore conduct current. The energy gap between the valence and conduction band is called the '''band gap'''.

Every material has associated with it a '''Fermi energy'''. Imagine the bands &quot;filling up&quot; from the bottom up, like water poured into a container. The continuous nature of the filling arises from the fact that there are such are large number of electrons they are essentially infinite in number. This behavior does not happen in a single atom, as the small number of electrons means that the amount of energy is heavily quantized. The Fermi energy is the level of the top of the &quot;sea&quot; that is formed. This is defined at absolute zero, when there is no thermal energy to allow the electronics to form &quot;ripples&quot; on the the sea.

In insulators, the Fermi level lies between the valence and conduction bands, in one of the &quot;forbidden zones&quot; where electrons cannot exist. Thus all electrons in the lattice are in the valence band or a band under that. To get to the conduction band, the electron has to gain enough energy to jump the band gap. Once this is done, it can conduct. However ,the band gap for insulators is large (over 3 eV) so very few electrons can jump the gap. Therefore, current does not flow easily in insulators.

In metals, the conduction band and the valence band overlap or the valence band is only partially full, both with the Fermi energy somewhere inside. This means that the metal always has electrons that can move freely and so can always carry current.

In semiconductors, the Fermi energy is between the valence and conduction band, but the band gap is smaller, allowing electrons to jump the gap fairly easily, given the energy to do it. At absolute zero, semiconductors are perfect insulators, but at room temperature, there is enough thermal energy to allow occasional electron jumps, given the semiconductor limited conductivity, even though, by rights, it should be an insulator.

If there are no electrons in the conduction band of a semi-conductor it won't conduct.  To move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band, one needs to give them
energy.  This may be through heat, incident light or high electric field. As most semiconductors operate at non-zero temperature, there are generally some electrons in the conduction band.  This
also means that if the semi-conductor gets too hot (125°C for silicon), excess electrons will exist in the conduction band, hence the semi-conductor will act more like a conductor.

Because intrinsic semiconductors contain no &quot;extra&quot; electrons from impurities like extrinsic semiconductors do, every time an electron jumps the band gap, it leaves a '''hole''' behind. This hole represents a positive charge as it is the lack of an electron. Intrinsic semiconductors have exactly equal numbers of holes and electrons, so, where ''n'' is the number of electrons and ''p'' is the number of holes,

==Direct and Indirect Semiconductors==

[[Image:si bandgap.png|thumb|300px|Figure 4: Band-gap for silicon]]

The total energy of an electron is given by its momentum and its
potential energy.  To move an electron from the conduction band to
the valence band, it may need to undergo a change in potential
energy and a change in momentum.  There are two basic material
types, in-direct and direct band gap materials.  In an indirect
band gap material, such as silicon, shown in figure
4, to move into the valence band, the electron
must undergo a change in momentum and energy&lt;ref&gt;John Allison. Electronic Engineering Semiconductors and devices. McGraw-Hill Book Company, Shoppenhangers Rd Maidenhead Berkshire England, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;. The chance of this event is small.  Typically this process is achieved in several steps. The electron
will first move to a trap site in the forbidden band before moving
into the valence band.  A change in potential energy will result
in the release of a photon, while a change in momentum will
produce a phonon (a phonon being a mechanical vibration which
heats the crystal lattice).

[[Image:GaAs_bandgap.png|thumb|300px|Figure 5: Band-gap for GaAs, a direct semiconductor]]

In a direct band-gap material such as GaAs, only a change in
energy is required, as seen in figure 5. As
such GaAs is very efficient at producing light, although in the
infrared spectrum.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Extrinsic Semiconductors==

One may also dope the
semiconductor material. Semi-conductor materials are doped with
impurities chosen to give the material special characteristics.
One may want to add extra electrons or remove electrons.

[[Image:N-doped Si.svg|right|300px|thumb|Figure 6: N-type [[w:Silicon|silicon]], doped with [[w:Phosphorous|phosphorous]]]]

[[Image:P-doped Si.svg|right|300px|thumb|Figure 7: P-type [[w:Silicon|silicon]], doped with [[w:Boron|boron]]]]

Doping atoms are chosen from elements in group III or V of the
periodic table[1] which are similar in size to silicon atoms.
Thus individual intrinsic semiconductor atoms may be replaced with
dopant atoms to form an extrinsic semi-conductor.

The binding energy of the outer electron added by the impurity is
weak.  This is represented by placing the excess electrons just
below the conduction band.  Thus very little energy is required to
move these electrons into the conduction band.  Thus an extrinsic
semi-conductor operating at room temperature will have most of
these &quot;extra&quot; electrons existing in the conduction band.  Thus at
normal operating temperature,

::&lt;math&gt;n_c\approx N_d&lt;/math&gt;,

Where &lt;math&gt;n_c&lt;/math&gt; is the number of conduction electrons and &lt;math&gt;N_d&lt;/math&gt; is the number of dopant atoms.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;

==Fermi Level==
The number of energy levels in the conduction
band is given by&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Sze. Physics of Semiconductor Devices. Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;N_c&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
N_c\approx 2\bigg(\frac{2m_e\pi kT}{h^2}\bigg)^\frac{3}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the effective mass of an electron.

The number of energy levels in the valence band is given by &lt;math&gt;N_v&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
N_v\approx 2\bigg(\frac{2m_h\pi kT}{h^2}\bigg)^\frac{3}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_h&lt;/math&gt; is the effective mass of a hole.

For an intrinsic semi-conductor, the number of conduction
electrons must equal the number of conduction holes.  Such that

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
n_c=n_v
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;n_c&lt;/math&gt; is the number electrons in the conduction band and
&lt;math&gt;n_v&lt;/math&gt; is the number of conduction holes in the valence band, given
by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
n_c=N_ce^\frac{E_f-E_c}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
n_v=N_ve^\frac{E_f-E_v}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

for an n-type extrinsic semiconductor, the number of conduction
electrons &lt;math&gt;n_c&lt;/math&gt; must equal the number of conduction holes plus the
number of ionized donor atoms, &lt;math&gt;n_d&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
n_c=n_v+n_d
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
n_d\approx N_de^\frac{E_f-E_d}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Carrier_density.png|Carrier density for doped semiconductor]]&lt;br&gt;''Figure 8: Carrier density for doped semiconductor''&lt;/center&gt;

Figure 8 shows this relationship against
temperature.  At the operating temperature, the electrons
available for conduction is relatively constant, as most donor
electrons exist in the conduction band.  For high temperatures
electrons from the valance band begin to populate the conduction
band, significantly increasing the carrier density.  The electrons
in the conduction band are now dominated by electrons from the
intrinsic semiconductor and it is said to be intrinsic.  For very
low temperatures, the donor electrons no longer populate the
conduction band and the semi-conductor is said to freeze out.

==Conduction==
'''electron mobility:''' When an electric field is applied to a
semiconductor, the electrons experience a force and are
accelerated in the opposite direction of the electric field.  This
acceleration is inhibited by what we term 'collisions'
[1].  When a collision occurs, the velocity of
the electron drops to zero and it accelerates again.  The average
time between collisions is given by &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt;.

The effect is a constant drift velocity for an n-type semiconductor &lt;math&gt;V_n&lt;/math&gt; given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
V_n=-\mu\cdot\xi
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\mu =\frac{q\tau_c}{m_e}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the mobility.  Its derivation is complicated as the
velocities have a Maxwellian distribution.

The current density &lt;math&gt;J_n&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
J_n=\frac{I}{A}=-qnV_n
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of electrons per unit volume &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; their
charge. One may also express the current density in terms of the
conductivity &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
J_n=\sigma\xi
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\sigma=qn\mu
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the conductivity in siemens per meter and &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; the
electric field.

Conduction is further complicated by additional diffusion of
carriers.  The voltage drop across the
semiconductor is gradual and therefore sets up an electron density
gradient.  Electrons which exist at higher densities experience a
force towards less dense region.  Thus a Diffusion co-efficient
&lt;math&gt;D_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined along with electron density gradient &lt;math&gt;\nabla n&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
J_n=qn\mu_n\xi+qD_n\nabla n
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
D_n=\frac{kT}{q}\mu_n
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
The same equations also apply for a p-type semicondcutor with a few minor differences.

== Simple Models ==

These simple models are small signal approximations to how a fairly generic diode works.  Zener and tunnel diodes are ignored.

At a first approximation, a diode is a device that will let current flow in one direction with zero resistance and will block current in the other direction with infinite resistance.  Basically, it operates like a check valve for current.

A second approximation includes a constant voltage drop for current flow in the forward direction.  The voltage drop varies with the type of diode, but is typically around 0.7 volts for fairly generic diodes and well over 1 volt for LEDs.

To get a third approximation, add a little resistance to the diode.  Now things get a little more complicated.  Since the v-i curve is non-linear, the resistance is not constant.  However, if your signal is small and carried on a large offset, you can do a fairly accurate analysis by properly selecting the voltage drop and resistance.

Finally the fourth approximation accounts for the small leakage current that exists when the diode is reverse biased.  This is typically in the range of nano-amps to a few micro-amps for most generic diodes.

If you need more accuracy than this, you will need to look at the physics that happens inside a diode.

== Analysis of Diode Physics ==

Diodes junctions may be formed with N type and P
type semi-conductor or semi-conductor and Metal junction.


as &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:diode1.png|center|frame|alt=Depiction of Fermi level for metal and semiconductor|Depiction of the Fermi level for a metal and a semiconductor.]]

When the Metal and Semi-conductor come together, excess electrons
diffuse from the semi-conductor to the metal until the Fermi
levels are equal.  As electrons diffuse from the semi-conductor to
the metal, they leave behind their donor atom.  This depletes the
region near the interface of charge carriers and hence this region
does not conduct well.  Thus for charges to diffuse across this
region, they require additional energy.  Since the extent of the
depletion of charges is some function of distance, the conduction
band is bent to represent the energy required for diffusion in
that region.

[[File:diode2.png|center|frame|alt=Depiction of femi level for metal and semiconductor|Depiction of the Fermi level for a metal and a semiconductor.]]

There will now exist 2 currents.  Electrons diffuse from metal to
semi-conductor over the barrier induced by the depletion region
&lt;math&gt;I_O&lt;/math&gt;.  Electrons diffuse from the semi-conductor over this
barrier in the opposite direction &lt;math&gt;I_F&lt;/math&gt;.  When there is no
external applied voltage, there current will be equal and
opposite.

Electrons will diffuse from semi-conductor to metal if they have
enough energy to overcome the barrier.  The energy of an electron
is statistical, and is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution [1].  Thus as the temperature increases, the
probability of the number of electrons occupying higher energy
states increases. For low doping densities, the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution may also be applied.  However for non-zero
temperature most excess electrons from the dopant will exist in
the conduction band.

Maxwell-Boltzman distribution says: given an energy W, the number
of electrons with energy greater than W is given by:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
n_W=n\cdot e^\frac{-W}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where n is the number density of electrons, k Boltzmann's constant
and T the temperature.

[[File:fermi_prob.png|frame|center|alt=Fermi level probability density function|Probability density function of electrons around Fermi level]]

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution does not apply to metals.  The
reason may be found in the referenced [1].  For
small voltages one may assume &lt;math&gt;I_O&lt;/math&gt; to be constant.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
I_F=nqe^\frac{-q\Psi}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;I_O=I_F&lt;/math&gt; for no external potential.  This equilibrium exists for
a diffusion potential we will call &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt;\Psi=\phi_m-\phi_s&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the energy of an electron to cross
this barrier is given by &lt;math&gt;q\Psi&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
I_O=I_F=nq\cdot e^\frac{-q\Psi}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
nq=I_O\cdot e^\frac{q\Psi}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The fermi level of the n-type semi-conductor may be increased by
an external potential.  This will increase the number of electrons
with energy to diffuse across the barrier.  Thus the energy for
electron to cross the barrier will become &lt;math&gt;q(\Psi-V)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
I_F=nq\cdot e^\frac{-q(\Psi-V)}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
I_F=I_O\cdot e^\frac{q\Psi}{kT}\cdot e^\frac{-q(\Psi-V)}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
I_F=I_O\cdot e^\frac{qV}{kT}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Thus:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
I_D=I_F-I_O
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Let:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
V_T=\frac{kT}{q}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Then:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
I_D=I_O\bigg(e^\frac{V_D}{V_T}\bigg)-I_O
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
I_D=I_O\bigg(e^\frac{V_D}{V_T}-1\bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


===Depletion Width===
The depletion width is given by the required amount of charge to be displaced to
realize the diffusion potential. Thus if one knows the doping
density and relative permittivity of the material, then one may
calculate the depletion width.

[[File:diode_depletion.png|frame|center|alt=Diagram of diode depletion region|Depletion region in diode junction]]

The depletion width is easiest realized by Poisson's Equation
[1]. Assume constant doping density.

By Poisson's equation:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}V(x)=\frac{\rho}{\varepsilon}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho=qN_d&lt;/math&gt; the charge density, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; the
permittivity and x the distance from the junction.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
V=\frac{qN_dx^2}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The depletion width is some function of barrier height,
&lt;math&gt;(\Psi-V)&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore solve for &lt;math&gt;x=W_d&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\Psi-V=\frac{qN_dW_d^2}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
W_d=\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V)}{qN_d}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===Depletion capacitance===
Capacitance is the change in charge
for change in voltage over the depletion width.

Given:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial V}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
Q=qN_dW_dYZ
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


Then:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C=\frac{\partial(qN_dW_dYZ)}{\partial(\Psi-V)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C=qN_dYZ\frac{\partial W_d}{\partial(\Psi-V)}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C=qN_dYZ\cdot\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}{qN_d}\cdot
-\frac{1}{2}\bigg(\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V)}{qN_d}\bigg)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C=-\frac{1}{2}qN_dYZ\cdot\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}{qN_d}}\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}{qN_d}}\cdot
\sqrt{\frac{qN_d}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V)}}\cdot
\frac{\sqrt{\Psi}}{\sqrt{\Psi}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C=-\frac{1}{2}qN_dYZ\cdot\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}{qN_d}}\cdot
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\Psi}}\cdot\sqrt{\frac{\Psi}{\Psi-V}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C=-\frac{1}{2}qN_dYZ\cdot\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}{qN_d\Psi}}\cdot
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-V/\Psi}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Let:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
C_0=-\frac{1}{2}qN_dYZ\cdot\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}{qN_d\Psi}}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
Therefore:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{C_0}{\sqrt{1-V/\Psi}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistors, or IGFETs are are very important part of modern electronics. IGFETs control the flow of current using an electrical field applied at a contact, called the '''gate''', which is electrically isolated from the current-carrying medium.

In early FETs, the gate was made using metal, with an oxide (Silicon Dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)), serving as the insulator, leading to the name Metal Oxide Semiconductor FETs, or MOSFETs. This name has stuck even though gates are now commonly manufactured using polysilicon. The name has, however, stuck, and MOSFET is generally synonymous with IGFET, with a few exceptions.

==MOSFET Basics==

MOSFETs have two regions, called the '''source''' and '''drain''' which are heavily doped. These are embedded in a substrate, which is doped the other way. The gap between the source and drain regions, which spans the substate, is where the current will eventually flow. A layer of insulating oxide is placed over this gap (the '''channel'''), and on top of that, a gate contact, usually made of polysilicon.

The way a MOSFET works is to modify a thin layer of this gap, or channel, using an electric field that propagates through the insulation. This modification could be either increasing the current carrying capacities of the channel, or reducing it. Thus, we have two kinds of devices - enhancement mode MOSFETs and depletion mode MOSFETs. Depending on what kind of silicon is in the channel, a MOSFET can be p-channel or n-channel. A p-channel MOSFET has p-type silicon in the channel when 'on.' This will be explained more clearly soon.

==MOSFET operation==

[[Image:FET_cross_section.png|thumbnail|Cross Section of an NMOS]]

The operation of a MOSFET can be separated into three different modes, depending on the voltages at the terminals. For the NMOSFET the modes are:

===Cut-off or sub-threshold mode=== 

When 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{GS} &lt; V_{T}&lt;/math&gt; 

where 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the threshold voltage of the device. 

Here the switch is turned off, and there is no conduction between drain and source.  While the current between drain and source should ideally be zero since the switch is turned off, there is a weak-inversion current, or subthreshold leakage.  With MOSFET scaling subthreshold leakage composes a large percentage of total power consumption.

===Triode or linear region===

When 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{GS} &gt; V_{T}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{DS} &lt; V_{GS} - V_{T}&lt;/math&gt;

The switch is turned on, and a channel has been created which allows current to flow between the drain and source.  The MOSFET operates like a resistor, controlled by the gate voltage.  The current from drain to source is:

:&lt;math&gt;I_D \approx \frac{\mu_n C_{ox}}{2}\frac{W}{L}\bigg[2(V_{GS}-V_{T})V_{DS}-{V_{DS}}^2\bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

===Saturation===

When 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{GS} &gt; V_{T}&lt;/math&gt; 

and

:&lt;math&gt;V_{DS} &gt; V_{GS} - V_{T}&lt;/math&gt;


The switch is turned on, and a channel has been created which allows current to flow between the drain and source.  Since the drain voltage is higher than the gate voltage, a portion of the channel is turned off. The onset of this region is also known as pinch-off. In first approximation the drain current is now independent of the drain voltage, and the current is only controlled by the gate voltage:

:&lt;math&gt;I_D \approx \frac{\mu_n C_{ox}}{2}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_{T})^2&lt;/math&gt;

In digital circuits the transistors are only operated in cut-off and saturation mode. The triode mode is mainly relevant for analog applications.</text>

== MESFET Operation ==

Assume an N channel MESFET with uniform doping and sharp depletion
region shown in figure 1.

The depletion region &lt;math&gt;W_n&lt;/math&gt; is given by the depletion width for a
diode.  Where the voltage is the voltage from the gate to the
channel, where the channel voltage is given for a position x along
the channel as &lt;math&gt;V_{gc}(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;W_n(x)=\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V_{gc}(x))}{qN_d}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;W_n(x)^2=\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V_{gc}(x))}{qN_d}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{W_n(x)^2qN_d}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}=\Psi-V_{gc}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;V_{gc}(x)=\Psi-\frac{W_n(x)^2qN_d}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV_{gc}(x)}{dW_n(x)}=-\frac{2W_n(x)qN_d}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}&lt;/math&gt;             (1)

The current density in the channel is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;J_n=\sigma\xi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_n(x)=\sigma \xi\cdot W\cdot b(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_n(x)=-\sigma \frac{dV_{gc}(x)}{dx}W(a-W_n(x))&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\xi=-\frac{dV_{gc}(x)}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;I_n(x)=-\sigma aW\bigg(1-\frac{W_n(x)}{a}\bigg)\frac{dV_{gc}(x)}{dWn(x)}\frac{dWn(x)}{dx}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^L I_n(x)\, dx=\int_0^L-\sigma aW\bigg(1-\frac{W_n(x)}{a}\bigg)\frac{dV_{gc}(x)}{dW_n(x)}\frac{dW_n(x)}{dx}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_n\cdot L= -\sigma aW\int_{Wn(0)}^{W_n(L)}
\bigg(1-\frac{W_n(x)}{a}\bigg)\frac{dV_{gc}(x)}{dW_n(x)}\, dW_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting from equation 1:

:&lt;math&gt;I_n= \frac{-\sigma aW}{L}\int_{W_n(0)}^{W_n(L)}
\bigg(1-\frac{W_n(x)}{a}\bigg)\bigg(-\frac{2W_n(x)qN_d}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}\bigg)\,
dWn(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_n= \frac{\sigma aW2qN_d}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_rL}\int_{W_n(0)}^{W_n(L)}
\bigg(W_n(x)-\frac{W_n(x)^2}{a}\bigg)\, dWn(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_n= \frac{2\sigma aWqN_d}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_rL}
\bigg[\frac{W_n^2(x)}{2}-\frac{W_n^3(x)}{3a}\bigg]_{W_n(0)}^{W_n(L)}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_n= \frac{2\sigma aWqN_d}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_rL}
\bigg[\frac{W_n^2(L)-W_n^2(0)}{2}-\frac{W_n^3(L)-W_n^3(0)}{3a}\bigg]
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_n= \frac{2\sigma aWqN_da^2}{6L\cdot
2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}
\bigg[\frac{3(W_n^2(L)-W_n^2(0))}{a^2}-\frac{2(W_n^3(L)-W_n^3(0))}{a^3}\bigg]
&lt;/math&gt;

One defines constant &amp;Beta; as the channel conductance with no
depletion.  And the work function to deplete the channel
W&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; [1]:

:&lt;math&gt;W_{00}=\Psi-V_{to}=\frac{qN_da^2}{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{\sigma a}{3LW_{00}}&lt;/math&gt;

We now define V&lt;sub&gt;to&lt;/sub&gt;, the voltage such that the channel is pinched off.  d is the ratio of channel depletion to maximum depletion for the drain.  s the ratio of channel depletion to
maximum depletion for the source.

:&lt;math&gt;d=\frac{W_n(L)}{a}=\frac{\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V_{gd})}{qN_d}}}{\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V_{to})}{qN_d}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\Psi-V_{gd}}{W_{00}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{W_n(0)}{a}=\frac{\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V_{gs})}{qN_d}}}{\sqrt{\frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r(\Psi-V_{to})}{qN_d}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\Psi-V_{gs}}{W_{00}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting:

:&lt;math&gt;I_n= W\cdot \frac{\sigma a\cdot W_{00}}{3L}
\big[3(d^2-s^2)-2(d^3-s^3)\big]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I_n= W \cdot\beta W_{00}^2 \big[3(d^2-s^2)-2(d^3-s^3)\big]&lt;/math&gt; (2)

Equation 2 is '''Shockley's expression''' [2] for drain current in the linear region.  When the device enters saturation, one end is pinched off(normally the drain). Thus $d=1$ and one may derive the equation for the saturation region:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{sat}=\beta W_{00}^2(1-3s^2+2s^3)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_m=3\beta W_{00}(s-1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_{DS}=3\beta W_{00}(1-d)&lt;/math&gt;

==Simpler Model==

:&lt;math&gt;I_{ds}=\frac{3}{2}\beta
W_{00}^2\bigg[\frac{(V_{gs}-v_{to})^2}{W_{00}^2}-\frac{(V_{gd}-v_{to})^2}{W_{00}^2}\bigg]
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g_m=3\beta W_{00}(V_{gs}-V_{to})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;G_{ds}=3\beta W_{00}(V_{gd}-V_{to})&lt;/math&gt;

=== General power law: ===

It was found that a general power law provided a better fit for real devices [3].

:&lt;math&gt;I_{ds}=\beta\big[(V_{gs}-V_{to})^Q-(V_{gd}-V_{to})^Q\big]&lt;/math&gt;

Where Q is dependent on the doping profile and a good fit is usually obtained for Q between 1.5 and 3. A general power law is approximately equal to Shockley's equation for Q = 2.4. &amp;Beta; is also empirically chosen and is proportion to the previous &amp;Beta;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta \mbox{ proportial to } \frac{\sigma aW}{3LW_{00}}&lt;/math&gt;

Modelling the various regions is done though model binning.  This however infers that a sharp transition exists from one region to another, which may not be accurate.

:&lt;math&gt;I_{ds}=\left\{
\begin{matrix}
0&amp;V_{gs}&lt;V_{to}\\
\beta\big[(V_{gs}-V_{to})^Q-(V_{gd}-V_{to})^Q\big]&amp;V_{gs}\le

When examining crystals we make a few assumptions about them for simplicity.
Such as:
* They are Periodic
* They are symmetrical
* They are infinitely large
* They compose a lattice

Although the infinite claim is a bit sketchy, it is a pretty good approximation as these crystals are often huge compared to distances in the crystal.


Since crystals exist in 3D space, and are periodic, if we move the size of the crystal in one of its axis we are at a corresponding spot. Mathematically we say that we have three linearly independent vectors and can move integer values of them to corresponding places in the lattice.

&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = u\mathbf{a} + v\mathbf{b}+ w\mathbf{c} &lt;/math&gt;

==Unit Cells==

If we have a lattice it must be made up of smaller components, the unit cell is the smallest undivisible part of the lattice. And by placing many unit cells together, you can create the whole lattice again. Imagine a large stack of dice, you could say that one die was the unit cell for this crystalline lattice.

There is an infinite number of possible unit cells, but only 14 types of lattice. This can be generallised to 7 crystal classes.

Also there is a minimum size of the unit cell, with its volume being 1 lattice point (atom/molecule/whatever).

===Some Cells and their Packing Fractions===
====Cubic====
Imagine a cubic unit cell with one point at each corner. So 8 points in total, but each of these is shared between it and 7 other cubes.

[[Image:cubic.svg|frame|A cubic unit cell]]

So the amount of lattice points per cell is 8 * 1/8 = 1. We call this the Primitive.

Now if we imagine each point as a sphere which touches its neighbours, then we can define the ''Packing Fraction'' as the volume taken up by the points compared to the volume of the cell.

In Cubic cells each sphere will have a radius half the size of the crystal. So we say r = a/2.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V_{point} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

And there is one per cell, ie the primitive = 1. So:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Packing Fraction = \frac{V_{point}}{V_{cell}} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^3}{a^3} = \frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
or 52%

====Body Centre Cubic====
Like a cubic unit cell except has another lattice point directly in its centre.

[[Image:Cubic-body-centered.svg|frame|A body centre cubic unit cell]]

Primitive = 8 * 1/8 + 1 = 2.

It has a Packing Fraction of 68%.












====Face Centre Cubic====
This is a close packed lattice, it's like a cubic except all 6 faces have another point at their centre.

[[Image:Cubic-face-centered.svg|frame|A face centre cubic unit cell]]

Primitive = 8 * 1/8 + 6 * 1/2 = 4

Packing Fraction = 74%</text>

[[Image:BJT symbol NPN.svg|100px|right|thumb|BJT NPN Transistor]]
A transistor is the most basic of digital devices. It has three terminals: the base, the collector, and the emitter. These terminals are connected to a piece of silicon that has been treated to have certain properties that allow it to behave as an amplifier, a switch, or other electronic devices.

== Transistors as a Digital Device ==

At the most basic level, a transistor can be thought of as a switch, allowing current to flow if the base of the transistor is fed a reasonably high voltage compared to the emitter. This means that in a five volt system (+5v), voltages between 0v and 1v are considered 'low' and voltages between 4v and 5v are considered 'high'. Voltages between 1v and 4v are considered undefined and should not be applied to the input of a transistor acting as a logic device.
Because transistors do not act like an ideal switch, they are arranged in ways that allow them to more closely emulate an ideal logic gate. More information on the different types of transistor families and associated logic will come later.

== Transistor Anatomy ==

There are two main types of transistors: Bipolar Junction (BJT) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (MOS). These transistors are fabricated differently from slightly different materials, however they can be arranged to perform similar functions.

=== Inside a BJT ===

[[Image:Transistor Silicon Diagram NPN.png|thumb|BJT Silicon]]A Bipolar Junction Transistor is made up of a piece of silicon that has been treated to create a 'channel' in the silicon. First, an undoped (untreated) piece of silicon is selected. (Undoped silicon acts as an insulator, preventing the flow of current.) Next, a process is used to create an N-type channel in the silicon. This is silicon that has an overabundance of negative charge carriers (electrons). A second channel is created in the first, this time with P-type silicon. P-type silicon carries current because of the overabundance of positive charge carriers ('holes', they're called). The process has created three regions in the silicon, an N-type region, a P-type region, and another N-type region. The base terminal is connected to the P-type region, while the collector and emitter are connected to the opposing N-type regions. 



Effectively, for the average transistor, when the base of the transistor rises above 0.7V (compared to the emitter), the impedance between the collector and the emitter begins to fall, until at about 1.2V it has virtually no resistance.


BJTs are current controlled devices.
The following assumes that the BJT is NPN construction. It is possible to construct BJTs as PNP but these are normally slower and thus not popular.
The base emitter junction is a diode. If the device is based on silicon (as opposed to germanium or 3-5 compoundes like galium/arsnides) then the forward volt drop of the diode is assumed to be 0.7V.
In practice the transistor starts to change state at 0.65V and by 0.75V is fully saturated. This means that the electric current flowing from collector to emitter is near 0 whilst the base emitter voltage is below 0.65V (and hence there is no electric current flowing from base to emitter) then there is no current flow from collector to emitter.
As the voltage from base to emitter is raised to 0.75 the current flow from base to emitter will increase by at least a factor of 100. This will increase the flow of current from collector to base by at least the same amount.
By the time the base to emitter voltage is greater than 0.75V the current flowing from collector to emitter will typically be 100 times greater (this is amplification) and the collector to emitter voltage will have droped to 0.3V and cannot be further reduced hence the transistor will be said to be in saturation.
Technically the transistor is saturated when the collector voltage is below the base voltage.

===An example===
Reference: &quot;Transistor Manual&quot; published in 1964 by General Electric Company

Page 44 has two graphs related to the NPN Transistor 2N1613, whose tabulated data are shown on page 548. 
*a) The Volt-Current (''VI'') characteristic (Collector current versus collector-to-base voltage) for different base currents), and
*b) The base current versus base-to-emitter voltage.

The ''VI'' graph shows that 
* negligible collector current flows if the base current is zero,
* about  9 mA flows if the base current is roughly 0.1 mA,
* about 45 mA flows if the base current is roughly 0.4 mA,
* about 75 mA flows if the base current is roughly 0.7 mA.

*A change of base current from 0.1 to 0.4, of 0.3 mA, results in a collector current change from 9 to 45, of 36 mA, so that the approximate current gain is 36 divided by 0.3 = 120.
*A change of base current from 0.4 to 0.7 mA, of 0.3 mA, results in a collector current change from 45 to 75, of 30 mA, so that the approximate current gain (current amplification) is (30 divided by 0.3 =) 100.
*MAXIMUM collector to base voltage, per data sheet, is 60 V, but the ''VI'' graph only shows voltage up to 50, which is below the permitted maximum.
*The graph for the base ''VI'' relationship shows that there is negligible base current if the base to emitter voltage is below 0.5 V.
*It also shows that for a base current of 5 mA to flow only about 0.9 V from base to emitter is needed. From above, only up to about 0.7 mA base current are needed.
*From the data sheet we see that the rated maximum power for this transistor is only 0.8 Watt if the case temperature in free air cooling is no more than 25 degrees Celsius, but that a maximum of 1.7 Watts would result in a very hot case temperature of about 100 degrees C. Let us use only up to 0.8 Watts; this power curve is not shown on the collector current graph, but we can add it there: For 0.8 Watts and a collector current of 100 mA the collector-emitter voltage is (0.8 W divided by 0.1 A =) 8V, 90 mA and 8.9V, 80 mA and 10V, ...... 45V and 18 mA, 50V and 16 mA.
*Assume we have two resistors in series connected to the power supply, and that one of these resistors is variable, the other one is fixed. As we vary the variable resistor from zero Ohms to its maximum, the voltage across it varies too. Obviously if it is zero resistance then the voltage across it is also zero, and the current is a maximum, being the voltage of the power supply divided by only the fixed resistor. If we set the variable resistor to its maximum value then the current is the power supply voltage divided by the sum of the two resistor values, and the voltage across the variable resistor is its resistance times the power supply voltage divided by the sum of the values in Ohms of these 2 resistors. Think of the variable resistor being the transistor, it being connected to the power supply via a fixed resistor. We can show on the collector current versus voltage graph a straight line for any such resistor, and we choose a line that is still within the permitted power area, possibly approximately a tangent to the maximum power curve. The graph in the book shows such a line, called a load line, connecting the 0V, 80 mA point with the 45V, 0 mA point. It indicates that the power supply voltage is 45V (zero current), and that the load resistor passes 80 mA if full power supply voltage is across it. Therefore the value of that load resistance is (45V divided by 0.08 A =) 562.5 Ohms. The nearest standard size resistor is 560 Ohms, to be connected between the power supply and the transistor.
*The collector graph shows also that as the base current is varied as above, there is a corresponding voltage change across the transistor, with the voltage change across the resistor being the difference between the voltage of the power supply and the voltage at the collector. Note that this voltage change is much higher than the voltage change in the base circuit; voltage amplification results.</text>

74 and 54 Series ICs all have a code on the top of the carrier body. This can be printed (usually in white) or etched. It consists of a &quot;core&quot; code which identifies the IC's function, and the type of electronics used within it. This is often supplemented by manufacturer's prefixes and suffixes which give information about the manufacturer and the carrier's physical form.

===Device Function===
This code tells you what the IC does. There are hundreds of these codes. Many common ones are given on the [[Practical Electronics/74 Series|74 Series]] page.

==Manufacturer Information==

===Prefix===
This tells you which company made the IC. There a many hundred of different prfixes, and dozens of manufacturers, some sharing the same prefix. As these prefixes are not unique to the 74 Series of ICs, these prefixes are listed separately and can be found [[Practical_Electronics/Manufacturers Prefix|here]].

===Suffix===
This tells you the type of package that the IC comes in, for example a DIP. It can also give information about the material (e.g. ceramic or plastic). These suffixes are not unique to the 74 Series of ICs, and as such, they are listed on a separate page, [[Packaging Suffixes|here]].

;Definition 1 (Topological Manifold):
A topological space &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is called an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''-dimensional topological manifold'' (or &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''-manifold'') if,

# &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff.
# &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is second-countable.
# Every point &lt;math&gt;x \in M&lt;/math&gt;'' has an open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U \subset M&lt;/math&gt; that is homeomorphic to an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

Note: As a convention, the ball &lt;math&gt;B^0&lt;/math&gt; is a single point. Any space with the discrete topology is a 0-dimensional manifold.


Note also that all topological manifolds are clearly locally connected.


To emphasize that a given manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional, we will use the shorthand &lt;math&gt;M^n&lt;/math&gt;. This is not to be confused with an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary cartesian product &lt;math&gt;M\times...\times M&lt;/math&gt;. However, we will prove later that such a construction ''does'' exist as well.


The alert reader may wonder why we require the manifold to be Hausdorff and second-countable. The reason for this is to exclude some pathological examples. Two such examples are the ''long line'', which is not second-countable, and the ''line with two origins'', which is not Hausdorff.

{{TextBox|1=
;Theorem 2:
A topological manifold is connected if and only if it is pathwise connected.
}}

''Proof'': Since all topological manifolds are clearly locally connected, the theorem immediately follows. {{Unicode|∎}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 3:
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a topological &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-manifold. Let &lt;math&gt;p\in M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p\in U\subseteq M&lt;/math&gt; be an open neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Now, let &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, U \rightarrow U^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U^\prime \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, be a homeomorphism. Then the pair &lt;math&gt;(U,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''chart at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;''.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 4:
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a topological &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-manifold, and let &lt;math&gt;A=\{(U_i,\phi_i)\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; be charts on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i = M&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;\{U_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is an open covering of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''atlas'' on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 5:
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-manifold and let &lt;math&gt;(U,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(V,\psi)&lt;/math&gt; be charts are a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (so &lt;math&gt;U\cap V \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;). Define the ''transition function'' (or ''chart transformation'') between the two charts as the homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ \phi^{-1} : \phi(U\cap V) \rightarrow \psi(U\cap V)&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

Given a pair &lt;math&gt;(M,A)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-manifold and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an atlas on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, properties that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; may satifsy are often expressed as properties of the transition functions between charts in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. This is how we will define our notion of a ''differentiable manifold''.

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 6:
An atlas for a manifold is ''smooth'' (or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;) if all the transition functions are smooth (All higher order partial derivatives exist and are continuous).
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 7:
A ''diffeomorphism'' is a smooth homeomorphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is also smooth.
}}

Note that in a smooth atlas, all transition functions are diffeomorphisms.

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 8:
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a manifold and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth atlas on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. Then, define &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathrm{max}}&lt;/math&gt; as the set of all charts &lt;math&gt;(V,\psi)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;(U,\phi)\in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ \phi^{-1}|_{\phi(U\cap V)}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ \phi^{-1}|_{\phi(U\cap V)}&lt;/math&gt; are smooth.
}}

A chart &lt;math&gt;(V,\psi)&lt;/math&gt; with the property described above is said to be ''compatible'' with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

{{TextBox|1=
;Lemma 9:
&lt;math&gt;A_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth atlas on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

''Proof'': We have to show that the transition functions between any pair of charts in &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathrm{max}}&lt;/math&gt; are smooth. This is obvious if one of then is in&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, so let &lt;math&gt;(V_1,\psi_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(V_2,\psi_2)&lt;/math&gt; be charts in &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathrm{max}}&lt;/math&gt; that are not in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;V_1\cap V_2\neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;(U,\phi)\in A&lt;/math&gt; be a chart such that &lt;math&gt;U\cap V_1 \cap V_2 = W\neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi\circ \psi_1^{-1}|_W&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_2\circ \phi^{-1}|_W&lt;/math&gt; are both smooth, since, both &lt;math&gt;(V_1,\psi_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(V_2,\psi_2)&lt;/math&gt; are compatible with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\psi_2\circ \psi_1^{-1}|_W=\psi_2\circ (\phi^{-1}\circ\phi )\circ \psi_1^{-1}|_W=(\psi_2\circ \phi^{-1}|_W) \circ (\phi\circ \psi_1^{-1}|_W)&lt;/math&gt; is smooth since it is a composition of smooth maps. An identical argument for &lt;math&gt;\psi_1\circ \psi_2^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; completes the proof. {{Unicode|∎}}

It should be obvious that if &lt;math&gt;A^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth atlas containing a smooth atlas &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathrm{max}}^\prime=A_{\mathrm{max}}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Smooth maps ==

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 10:
Let &lt;math&gt;M^m&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;N^n&lt;/math&gt; be smooth manifolds, &lt;math&gt;p\in M&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; be a function. Then, if for any charts &lt;math&gt;(U,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(V,\psi)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p\in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(p)\in V&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(\phi(p))=(\psi\circ f\circ \phi^{-1})(\psi(p))&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\phi(U\cap f^{-1}(V))\subseteq \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\psi(f(U)\cap V)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function on euclidean spaces, then &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''smooth at ''&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''smooth function'' if it is smooth for all &lt;math&gt;p\in M&lt;/math&gt;.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Lemma 11:
&lt;math&gt;f\,:\, M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; is smooth at &lt;math&gt;p\in M&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists charts &lt;math&gt;(U,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(V,\psi)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p\in U\subseteq f^{-1}(V)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(\psi\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}):\phi(U\cap f^{-1}(V)) \rightarrow \psi(f(U)\cap V)&lt;/math&gt; is smooth.
}}

''Proof'': &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous since &lt;math&gt;\psi\circ f\circ\phi^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is smooth and thus continuous and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; are homeomorphisms. Let &lt;math&gt;(U^\prime,\phi^\prime)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(V^\prime,\psi^\prime)&lt;/math&gt; be two other charts at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(p)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(\psi^\prime\circ f\circ{\phi^\prime}^{-1})=(\psi^\prime\circ\psi^{-1})\circ (\psi\circ f \circ \phi^{-1})\circ (\phi\circ {\phi^\prime}^{-1})&lt;/math&gt; which is a composition of smooth functions since the atlases on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are smooth, and is therefore smooth. {{Unicode|∎}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Remark 12:
By Lemma 11, we do not have to check ''all'' charts to see if a function is smooth. A relief, since maximal atlases tend to be uncountably big.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Definition 12:
If &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth bijective function such that its inverse is smooth too, it is called a ''diffeomorphism''. Two manifolds are called ''diffeomorphic'' if there exists a diffeomeorphism between them.
}}

{{TextBox|1=
;Lemma 13:
Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,M\rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\,:\,N\rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; be smooth. Then &lt;math&gt;g\circ f \,:\, M\rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt; is smooth as well.
}}

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;(U,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(V,\psi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(W,\xi)&lt;/math&gt; be charts on &lt;math&gt;M,N,P&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p,f(p),g\circ f(p)&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\xi \circ g\circ f\circ \phi^{-1}(\phi(p))=(\xi\circ g\circ\psi^{-1})\circ (\psi\circ f\circ\phi^{-1})(\phi(p))&lt;/math&gt; which is a composition of smooth maps of euclidean space and is hence smooth. {{Unicode|∎}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Finding A Gym==

Finding a gym can be a difficult task.  You can do a few things.  For example there's probably a recreation center or fitness club in your area.  Try looking in the telephone book to find numbers of local workout centers.  Many high schools also have designated days where you can come and use the gym for a small fee.  Ask friends where they work out and find out others opinions on places you might want to go.  Or, if you want to work out close to home, build your own gym.  You can get weights, a yoga mat, a treadmill (or take walks), workout bicycle (or bike around), and jump ropes.  You can do all your working out in your home at a very low cost.  Research what option is best for you, and go for it.  This is the easy part!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Broken code ==
The [{{fullurl:MediaWiki:Pagemovedtext|action=edit}} current code] was broken by recent changes to the way MediaWiki parses interface messages. The code below corrects the problem, links directly to the page (ignoring the redirect), and adds links to allow for easy whatlinkshere access and deletion. This version is currently used on [[m:MediaWiki:Pagemovedtext|Meta-Wiki]] and the [[s:MediaWiki:Pagemovedtext|English Wikisource]].

&lt;div style=&quot;padding:1em; border:1px dashed #2f6fab; text-align:left; color:#000; background-color:#f9f9f9; font-size:0.9em; font-family:monospace; line-height:1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
Page &quot;&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:$1|redirect=no}} $1]&quot; ([[Special:Whatlinkshere/$1|links]] &amp;bull; [{{fullurl:$1|action=delete}} delete])&lt;/span&gt; moved to &quot;[[$2]]&quot;.

'''Please [[{{ns:Special}}:Whatlinkshere/$2|check]]''' if this move has created any [[Help:Redirect|double redirect]]s, and fix them as necessary.
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Alternately, simply removing the &amp;lt;nowiki&amp;gt; tags will correct the display problem with the current version. // [[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] 23:38, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

Partitive formation varies for example 

'''lupaus''' (nom.) &gt;  '''lupauksen''' (gen.) '''lupausta''' (ptv.)
:abstract noun '''lupaus''' ''permission'' is derived from '''luvata''' ('''to permit''') 
::verb stem '''lupaa-''' + '''-us''' (abstract noun formation) &gt; '''laupaus''' (with standard dropping of the extra vowel)
  
'''kaipaus''' (nom.) &gt;  '''kaipauksen''' (gen.) '''kaipausta''' (ptv.)
:abstract noun '''kaipaus''' ''longing or yearning'' is derived from '''kaivata''' (to yearn 
for, long for, to miss)
::verb stem '''kaipaa-''' +'''-us''' (abstract noun formation) &gt; '''kaipaus''' (with standard dropping of the extra vowel)

'''lisäys''' (nom.) &gt; '''lisäystä''' (ptv.)
:abstract noun '''lisäys''' ''addition'' or ''increase'' is derived from '''lisätä''' ('''to increase. add to'')
::verb stem '''lisää-''' + '''-us''' (abstract nounn formation) &gt; '''lisäys''' (with standard dropping of the extra vowel)

'''lykkäys''' (nom.) &gt; '''lykkäystä''' (ptv.)
:abstract noun '''lykkäys''' ''postponement'' is derived from '''lykätä''' ''to postpone''
::stem lykkää-  become  (abstract noun, postponement)


The group that forms differently are usually formed from nouns and adjectives. These forms have genitive forms where the s transforms to d but partitive forms where the s transforms to t. 

'''vapaus''' (nom.) ''freedom'' &gt; vapautta 

rakkaus becomes rakkautta

onnettomuus becomes onnettomuutta

ystävyys becomes ystävyyttä

kateus becomes kateuta

pimeys becomes pimeyttä

The rule is that if the word is derived from a nominal form, then the partitive will take the standard -ta or -tä ending which usually attached to nominals ending in a consonant. BUT, if the word is derived from an adjective (which may itself be derived from a verb) the s usually mutates to to a t before the -ta or -tä ending ius added.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Problems in Weimar Republic ===

Very impressed with the wikibook in general, but I thought this bit was vague:
&quot;The Spartacists, or communists, challenged the authority. The Freikorps, a band of paramilitary soldiers that were left demobilized and unemployed after the war, caused additional problems for the Republic. Finally, the Brown Shirts, the reactionary conservative group, also created problems for the government.&quot;
Just saying that these groups 'challenged authority' or 'caused problems' for the Weimar government doesn't seem very clear. If you like I could have a go at changing it (I was thinking of just mentioning the Spartacist's attempted uprising c.early 1919 and the Freikorps' involvement in the Kapp Putsch) but I thought I'd check here before I went about altering your lovely book. Also, nitpicking, but shouldn't we say 'Sturmabteilung' instead of 'Brown shirts'? It would seem more consistent with the use of the German names for the Freikorps and such. 
Anyway, those are my thoughts. If nobody has anything to say on the matter I'll go ahead and change it myself.--[[User:AsaRoast|AsaRoast]] 13:32, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

== Holocoust ==

I believe that mentioning of WWII without mentioning the Holocoust or the extermination of 6 million Jews is a real problem. [[User:Dkronst|Dror Kronstein]] 01:02, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

Too true, there should be something about the Holocaust here. I think there should be mentions about how many lives were lost (Jews, non- Jews) in total because of the WWII (both in battle and in camps: Nazi camps and in Soviet camps). That's one of the things that have to be remembered about WWII, the scale of it and how much it changed the whole Europe.

== Russian Losses ==
Well, 6 million Jews were lost, but I don't hear anybody willing to talk about 20 million Russians who were lost...
:That's a good point. Why not [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] and add this information to the article. I look forward to seeing what you have to say about the topic :) [[User:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reece&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:39, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

== Bias ==

The part about Wilson's suggestions being perfect and the Treaty of Versailles being evil is ludicrously biased.--[[User:219.78.47.79|219.78.47.79]] 06:58, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

== Expansion ==
I think Expansion is needed on WWII. If you look at WWI, it is much, much more detailed, and WWII seems to be just a brief overview. [[User:Red4tribe|Red4tribe]] ([[User talk:Red4tribe|talk]]) 14:06, 21 June 2008 (UTC)

== World War II ==

I think world war II should have its own page due to its signifigance.

== Turkish War of Independence ==

I think it was a very significant event in the history of Europe. Though the &quot;borders&quot; of Europe come into question for something like this, I believe the wars of 1918-1923 greatly influenced Europe at large. The Megali Idea died in Greece, the Turkish Republic became the first ally of the Soviet Union and a great power was lost to history. I'm not sure if the Caucasus counts as a region of Europe, but the Turkish War of Independence (particularly regarding Armenia) and the Russian Civil War caused sweeping changes in terms of ethnicities in the region.

I will write a brief overview of the war if people think it is appropriate for the topic of European history, or appropriately influential. What are your view on this?

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Overview=

[[File:Induced_fit_diagram.svg|thumb]]

Enzymes are protein molecules that act as biological catalysts on reactions. This means that they speed up said reactions, but remain unchanged at the end. A vast majority of metabolic reactions are catalysed by enzymes. Enzymes are globular molecules just as we learnt about in the previous chapter, and so have their hydrophilic r R groups on the outside, making them soluble, but enzymes also have a speciality in that they possess an 'active site'. This active site allows other molecules to bind to the enzyme, and these molecules are known as the 'substrate', and the shape of the active site allows them to fit perfectly. Temporary bonds form between the substrate and the R groups on the enzymes amino acids, forming the '''enzyme-substrate complex'''. The substrate then unbinds in the form of its product.

Enzymes are said to be specific in their nature, as the shape of the active site will only allow one molecule to fit. It may either catalyse the breaking up or joining of molecules, forming one or more products. When the reaction is complete, these products leave the active site, and as said before - the enzyme is unchanged and can thus receive another substrate molecule. Most enzymes end in 'ase', for example lipase, amylase

=Activation Energy=

All reactions require energy - and the threshold of the reaction happening is known as the '''activation energy''' - the point at which the reaction begins to occur. Enzymes lower this activation energy, and sometimes this not only speeds up the process, but makes it happen in the first place as most of the reactions in living cells would be so slow that they would (for practical purposes), not happen at all.

One way of providing energy to reactions is to heat them, since this gives kinetic energy to the molecules and increases the rate of collisions between enzymes and substrates (more in the temperature section). Humans do this, maintaining a constant 37c within the body, but this is not enough for the activation energy required for many reactions - and thus enzymes solve this problem by reducing the activation energy. Enzyme-catalysed reactions take place faster and at a much lower temperature than standard reactions.

==A reaction's path==

We have said that when an enzyme catalyses a reaction, substrates combine with enzymes to form enzyme-substrate complexes, and a product is created. Take a look at [http://newarkbioweb.rutgers.edu/bio301s/enzyme3.jpg this graph]. Time is along the bottom, amount of product produced on the y-axis. It is a generic enzyme catalysed reaction - as you can see there is a large amount (the majority) of product collected quickly, but then the line levels off. 

This is because when there is a large amount of both enzyme and substrate, all enzyme molecules have a substrate in its active site, and collisions are constantly occurring, but as the reaction goes on and more substrate is used up, the longer it takes for a substrate to hit an enzyme (as the substrate becomes more scarce), and thus the more time enzymes are simply waiting. This initial period is known as the '''initial rate of reaction'''.

=Reaction Rate=

Rate of reaction can be measured in a couple of ways - the amount of product produced, the amount of substrate left (as subtracted from the initial total). For example, the rate at which amylase breaks down starch - both the product and substrate remain colourless in the mixture. Last chapter, the food test section showed that we test for the presence of starch with iodine - so to see the rate of reaction we can take a sample from the reaction mixture, mix it with iodine and test the intensity of the change with a colourimeter. This will give us results that can be plotted into a graph - the amount of starch remaining against time.

Various things affect a reaction rate, enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, temperature, pH and presence of enzyme inhibitors. These are discussed next.

==Enzyme Concentration==

Take a look at [http://www.pentech.ac.za/clients/biosci/Module%206%20Energetics_files/Module%206%20-%20Reaction%20Energetics%20and%20Enzymes_files/image002.jpg this graph]. It shows how '''increasing enzyme concentration increases the rate of the reaction''', and this is in line with enzyme theory as so long as there is sufficient substrate, there is more enzyme-substrate complexes being formed per second and thus, more product being formed every second - faster rate of reaction. However, something to note is that left to their own devices, these reactions would all eventually produce the same amount of product (assuming each has the same amount of substrate). The '''rate of reaction increases linearly with enzyme concentration.'''

==Substrate Concentration==

[http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/learnnet/cfb/images/07D.jpg This graph] shows how increasing the substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction, to a certain point. This is because, as substrate concentration increases, more enzyme-substrate complexes can be formed per second, but point x on the graph is known as the '''saturation point''', which is where every enzymes active site is working continuously, and the enzymes cannot work faster so substrate simply ends up 'queuing up' and waiting for an active site.

==Temperature==

Take a look at [http://www.agen.ufl.edu/~chyn/age2062/lect/lect_03/3_46.gif this graph]. The speed at which molecules move around freely is determined by the temperature giving them more or less energy to do so - at high temperatures the molecules, the enzymes and the substrates, move around fastest, and thus there are the most collisions per second, causing enzyme-substrate complexes to be formed more frequently. So why does the graph show the rate of reaction peak at 40c? After 40c, the bonds in the enzyme molecule begin to shake so violently that they begin to break, which causes the enzyme to lose it's shape, which changes the shape of the active site (so the substrate will no longer fit) and the enzyme is said to be '''denatured'''.  The reason the rate of reaction does not immediately drop to 0 is that the enzyme slowly loses shape as the temperature increases, and so the substrate fits less well and eventually not at all, and so the catalysis does not occur. The process of denaturing is usually irreversible.

In humans 40c is the '''optimum temperature''' for enzyme reactions- the temperature at which an enzyme catalyses a reaction at the maximum rate. We keep our bodies at 37c to make sure we never go above 40c as enzymes would start to denature at even the slightest upward variation - which would be extremely dangerous as nearly all reactions within the body rely on enzymes.

==Effects of pH==

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/images/gcsechem_18part1.gif This graph] shows the effect of pH on enzyme activity. pH is a measure of hydrogen ions in a solution (think: percentage Hydrogen), and these affect enzyme activity since the hydrogen ions can react with the enzyme and change the enzymes shape, deforming the active site. As with temperature, too high or low pH for the enzyme will denature the enzyme. The graph is just an example, since different enzymes have different optimum pH

=Inhibition=

There are two types of enzyme inhibition - that is, things that inhibit the enzymes function. They can be harmful in that they can stop a reaction happening, or helpful in stopping a reaction from running wild - perhaps the end-product of a chain of reactions will be an enzyme inhibitor to prevent the reaction continuing indefinitely.

==Competitive==

[[File:Competitive inhibitor diagram-1-.png|thumb|Example]]

Competitive enzyme inhibitors are named as such because they compete with the substrate for the enzyme molecule's active site's. They achieve this by being a similar shape and fitting into the active site, temporarily blocking substrate from entering. This makes the reaction slower, since there is less chance that genuine substrate will collide with an enzyme and form product. Competitive inhibitors affect on the enzyme is always reversible.
They can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration. This then increases the chances of for substrate to bond with the enzyme active site, and decreases the chances for the inhibitor.


&lt;div style=&quot;clear: both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

==Non-Competitive==

[[File:Competitive_inhibition.svg|thumb]]

Non-competitive enzymes are ones that do not compete, in that that either bind permanently to the active site or bind elsewhere, deforming the active site. Eventually, they will destroy all available enzymes, stopping the reaction short even if there is remaining substrate, since all active sites are either blocked or deformed. Unless the inhibitor only binds to somewhere else on the enzyme very briefly, the enzyme will be irreversibly unusable for normal enzyme-substrate complexes to form.

Example: The antibiotic penicillin acts by permanently filling an enzyme required for bacterial cell wall synthesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Luminosity is the total amount of light emitted by a particular star. It is the star's intrinsic brightness, or the amount of energy it emits each second. In many cases, this energy comes from thermonuclear reactions inside the star. In general, a star's luminosity depends on its current stage in its evolutionary sequence. Stars radiate various forms of electromagnetic radiation, such as ultraviolet radiation, visible light, infrared, and radio waves.

The luminosity of a star depends on its temperature and size. If two stars of different sizes both have the same temperature, the larger of the two will have a greater luminosity due to its larger surface area. 

The formula for calculating luminosity is 

&lt;math&gt;L=4 \pi r^2 * \delta T^4
&lt;/math&gt;

where T is the star's temperature in Kelvins.

Another way to measure a star's luminosity is by calculating its ''magnitude.'' There are two types of magnitude: apparent and absolute. Apparent is the luminosity of an object when viewed from Earth; absolute is the brightness of that object if it were 10 parsecs away from Earth.

The Sun has an apparent magnitude of -26.7, and an absolute magnitude of 4.8, while a full moon has an apparent magnitude of -12. Most visible stars range in apparent magnitude from -1.5 (Sirius) to 4 (Alcor). The dimmest ones just visible to the naked eye are around 6.5 (4 in the city with bright lights).

Stars are classified by orders of magnitude: alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta. These are called '''Bayer letters.'''

'''Cepheid variables''' are pulsating stars. They have a longer period and higher magnitude than other stars. By calculating the star's period and magnitude, the distance can be determined. Astronomers discovered from the Cepheid variables in Andromeda that the nebula was 2 million light-years away.

The stars which have been measured by astronomers up to date range from &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{500}&lt;/math&gt; to 500,000 times the luminosity of our Sun.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The two main types of galaxies are elliptical (E) and spiral (S).

Galaxies are typically found in clusters. These clusters are categorized as regular or irregular. Regular clusters contain mainly E galaxies, and are large, dense, and spherical. These clusters have formed from many collisions, causing the S galaxies to become E galaxies. Irregular clusters are thin and have no symmetry. They contain mostly S galaxies.

      <comment>/* Why is Ant Strategic? */ correct link.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is Apache Ant? ==
* An operating system and language neutral XML based &quot;Build Tool&quot;
* A scripting language for executing any complex file-system processes that can be run from a command line interface
* A.N.T. – Another Neat Tool
* Used for Building the Project

=== History of Ant ===

* Built by James Duncan Davidson
* Frustrated with the UNIX &quot;make&quot;
* Invented while turning a product from Sun into open source
* Make used &quot;tab&quot; as a record separator
* Tabs frequently got converted to spaces during copy/paste operations

=== Why is Ant Strategic? ===
Ant is important because it helps organizations create repeatable build processes.

Repeatability is critical to organizations reaching the next level of [[wikipedia:Capability Maturity Model|CMU's Capability Maturity Model]] :

# Initial
# Repeatable
# Defined
# Managed
# Optimized

Ant helps you get from the Initial to the Repeatable level.

=== Ant is a Process Discipline ===
* Process discipline helps ensure that existing practices are retained during times of stress
* When these practices are in place, projects are performed and managed according to their documented plans
* Answers the Question: ''How did the prior developer compile, test and install their system?''
* Excellent aid for ''software archeologists''

=== Software Project Lifecycle ===
* Version 1 and version 2 of a software package are frequently done by different groups
* Sometimes version 1 and 2 are done years apart by different teams in different countries
* Contractors and internal staff need to use the same tools
* Shared development processes, like those used in the Open Source community, would be almost impossible without tools like Ant

=== Ant is Operating System and Language Neutral ===
* Builds run on both Windows and UNIX/Linux systems
* Should run anywhere a Java VM runs
* Ant files &quot;know&quot; about file separators &quot;/&quot; vs. &quot;\&quot;
* Build targets can still do OS-specific tasks
* Works with anything that can be done from the command line
* Easy to extend (with Java)
* It is possible to extend with other languages as long as they have Java bindings but in practice, most people use Java to extend Ant

=== Ant and [[XML]] ===
* If you are familiar with XML (or even HTML) you will probably learn Ant quickly
* If you are not already familiar with XML you will need to learn some XML before you use Ant
* One of the best ways of doing this is to read many small Ant sample tasks
* This book should help you do this

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Organizational Ant Adoption ==

We have found that most people new to Ant go through several stages of learning Ant.

===The three stages of learning core Ant functionality===
# Learn the grammar and syntax of XML and a build file- this goes quickly if you know any XML or HTML (about 15 minutes)
# Learn the Ant concepts of properties, dependencies and task (about two hours)
# Build your vocabulary: Learn the basic Ant tasks you need to get your job done (duration depends on what you are doing)

=== Transform Your Organization!===
* Integrating it into your development/QA process
* Making it a requirement of all projects
* Specifying that all vendor deliverables MUST include a reproducible build process
* Problematic for Microsoft developers that are not familiar with Ant
* Problematic for &quot;visual only&quot; development environments (Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Analysis Services)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Brief Overview of XML ==
This chapter has a summary of the things you need to know about XML to use Apache Ant.  It is not a lot of information and users that are already familiar with HTML will pick up the concepts very quickly.

You do not need to know a lot about XML to use Ant.  Just a few syntaxical items.

First, you must be very careful to match up the &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot; tags.  Begin tags start with a &quot;&lt;&quot; and end tags have the same name but start with a &quot;&lt;/&quot;.  Here is an simple example:
   &lt;MyDataElement&gt;
      '''Data Inside…'''
   &lt;/MyDataElement&gt;

Train your eye to look for the '''&lt;/''' that ends a tag.  If it does not match up something is wrong.  Tags that do not match up will cause errors.

=== Data Element Nesting ===

All XML Data Elements must be paired using matching start and end tags:

   &lt;Parent_XML_Element&gt;
      &lt;Child_XML_Element&gt;
         &lt;Sub_Child_XML_Element&gt;
         &lt;/Sub_Child_XML_Element&gt;
      &lt;/Child_XML_Element&gt;
   &lt;/Parent_XML_Element &gt;

Understanding this paired nesting structure is critical to creating working Ant build files.

===XML Attributes===

The XML begin tag may also have attributes.

   &lt;MyTag attribute1=&quot;nothing&quot; attribute2=&quot;nothing else&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/MyTag&gt;

Dan just my thought here, the &quot;Core Concepts&quot; should be moved up to it's own level. Not as a sub to &quot;Getting Started&quot;.

Also IMO the last two sections are full of examples, and should be children of &quot;Examples&quot; section instead of main sections. Thanks for the intro to Ant!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hello World in Ant ==

Create a directory &quot;My Project&quot;.
Use a text editor such as Kate, Gedit or Notepad to create a file called build.xml within directory &quot;My Project&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
   &lt;project name=&quot;My Project&quot; default=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;
       &lt;target name=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;
          &lt;echo&gt;Hello World!&lt;/echo&gt;
       &lt;/target&gt;
   &lt;/project&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The first line in the file is flush left.  It tells ant that this is an XML file:

   &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

The next line names the (required) project &quot;My Project&quot; and its default target &quot;hello&quot;:

   &lt;project name=&quot;My Project&quot; default=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;

The central three lines name and define the only target (&quot;hello&quot;) and task (&quot;echo&quot;) in the file:

       &lt;target name=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;
          &lt;echo&gt;Hello World!&lt;/echo&gt;
       &lt;/target&gt;

You can now open a shell and cd to the &quot;My Project&quot; directory you created and type &quot;ant&quot;

== Output of Hello World ==
   Buildfile: build.xml
   
   hello: 
      [echo] Hello World!
   
   Build Successful
   Total time 0 seconds

==Variations==

Try changing the echo line to be the following:

   &lt;echo message=&quot;Hello There!&quot;&gt;&lt;/echo&gt;

What is the result?  Try the following also:

 &lt;echo message=&quot;Hello There!&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before starting, you will need to have a running version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.2 or later. For Ant 1.7, JDK 1.5 is recommended.  Ant will need a JAXP-compliant XML parser installed and available in your classpath.  The binary distribution of Ant includes the latest version of the Apache Xerces2 XML parser.

To install Ant on Windows, you can use [http://code.google.com/p/winant/ WinAnt the Windows installer for Apache Ant]. Download and run the latest version of WinAnt, and follow the directions in the installer. WinAnt will place the &quot;ant&quot; executable on your system path, which allows you to run the command &quot;ant&quot; from the command line at any directory in your system. Or, you can follow these directions:

The first step is to download Apache Ant.

There are two options.  You can compile the program from the source or for beginners we recommend just downloading a binary file called a zip file.

You can find the download page here: [http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi]

You will need to download a file such as

   apache-ant-1.7.0-bin.zip

This is a compressed archive file.  You will need to uncompress it.

If you are not familiar with the process of uncompressing a file you should consult your computer operating system manual.

After this is done, you will see a folder such as:

   apache-ant-1.7.0

This folder contains another folder called &quot;bin&quot;.  Within that there is a file called ant.bat that you can run directly from the command line.

   C:\ ant -version
   Apache Ant version 1.6.5 compiled on June 2 2005
   C:\

If you do not see this, you have to check your PATH variable to make sure that ant is in your path. You can do this by opening a prompt and typing the &quot;set&quot; command.

To add the path in Windows: Right click on &quot;My Computer&quot; and find the Environment Variables button. Find the System Variable &quot;Path&quot;, and add the path for Ant's bin folder (C:\ant\bin or whatever it is) separating it from other paths with a semicolon.

* '''[[../../Task|Ant Task]]''' – something that ant can execute such as a compile, copy or replace.  Most tasks have very convenient default values.  See the Ant manual for a complete list of tasks.
* '''Ant Target''' – a fixed series of ant tasks in a specified order that can depend on other named targets.  Targets can depend only on other targets, not on projects or tasks.  A target represents a particular item to be created, it can be a single item like a jar, or a group of items, like classes.
* '''Ant Project''' – a collection of named targets that can run in any order depending on the time stamps of the files in the file system.  Each build file contains one project.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Standard Targets=

One of the things that you learn is that if you name things consistently between projects, it is much easier to find things you are looking for.  When you work with other people, you also want to have targets that you both are familiar with.

==build.xml==
# Place your main build in a file called build.xml in the main directory of your project
# Do not put ANTreferences to local file systems (Windows C: etc.) in your build file.  Isolate these all in a local.properties file in the main directory

==folder standards==
* '''src''' - the location of your source code
* '''build''' - the output of a build process

==standard ant targets==
===init===
This target should create all temporary directories within the build folder

===clean===
This target should remove all compiled and intermediate files leaving only source files.  It should remove anything that can be derived from other files.  This would be run just prior to creating a zip file of the project.

===build===
This target should compile sources and perform transforms of raw data

===install===
The install target should be used to copy files to a testing or production system

==Other Standards==
Use the &lt;description&gt; element to describe what your target does.

If you have more than around 100 targets in your build file, it becomes unwieldy.  You could consider calling a separate build file, but that adds other complications such as the dependency between targets.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Using a Property file=

One of the best ways to keep your build files free of local dependencies is to use a local property file

   &lt;!-- the base directory of the data dictionary that contains
   all the date element raw information in XML, the XML Transformations
   and the validation schemas --&gt;
   &lt;property file=&quot;local.properties&quot;/&gt;

Here is a sample of a property file:

  # Property file for Project X
  # Author
  # Date
  # Note that the format of this file adheres to the Java Property file specification
  # http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.Reader)
  # to use the file put the following in your ant file:
  # &lt;propertyfile file=&quot;my.properties&quot;&gt;
  # All file names on local hard drives should be stored in this directory
  # Where Ant is installed.  Will not work with 1.5 due to exec/spawn calls
  antHome=C:/Apps/apache-ant-1.6.5
  Saxon8HomeDir=C:/Apps/saxon8
  saxon8jar=${Saxon8HomeDir}/saxon8.jar
  # used to make sure Saxon gets the right XSLT 2.0 processor
  processor=trax

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Dealing with Local File System Issues=

* Each developer or user has the right (or is forced by administrators) to put resource such as jar files and libraries in different locations
* Try to avoid having ANY local file system location dependencies in your build files.  Make sure you NEVER put C: in a build file.  This is just plain bad behavior
* Separate local file system access points in an external &quot;property file&quot;
* Warning: property files are read by Java tools and are not always path separator aware. You can use  &quot;\\&quot; on java, or, knowing that Ant expands existing properties, ${path.separator}
* Allow people to check out all the files in a project including the build.xml file, customize their local library paths and build
* Third party projects such as Ivy and Maven2 Ant tasks try to automate the entire library management process. Consider these on a very large/complex project.

The main page says I should try to leverage as much from other language courses as possible, but this is hardly possible when the other language courses don't go beyond variables.  I'm going to pull course material from my other site (http://devnet.gegn.net), but I would much prefer if I can use a better format then .avi for the lectures.  Any suggestions?

'''''&lt;center&gt;Forth&lt;/center&gt;'''''

Forth was first developed in the early 1970s for scientific applications by Charles Moore and Elizabeth Rather. 

For computers to be useful, they must be programmed.  For beginners this usually means programming in BASIC, but for professional programmers this could include:

* BASIC (considered too slow for many applications)
* Pascal
* Fortran
* C
* C++
* Ada
* Assembler (machine code – Not user friendly and limited to one CPU)



Forth is easy to start to learn, is compact and has fast execution.

This book is a complete guide to Forth programming.  In this book you will be introduced to the language through examples and comparisons with BASIC.  Later we will explore some of the more unusual aspects of Forth, some that have no equivalent in other languages.

* The 1994 ANS Forth standard dialect is adopted for much of this book. &lt;!-- FORTH-79 is ancient! Wake up and smell the 1990s ;) --&gt;


== How is Forth Different ==

There are many statements that at first glance may seem contradictory or confusing when you are talking about Forth.  For example, Forth: 

* is a threaded-interpretive language,
* is written in Forth,
* is extensible,
* is a high-level language that has access to primitive operators,
* is both an interpreter and a compiler,
* is an easy language for absolute beginners to program in,
* is difficult to master for programmers experienced in other languages,
* uses the stack and Reverse Polish Notation (RPN),
* uses integer arithmetic,
* uses spaces to separate input values,
* does not start to execute any of your typed input until after you press the enter key,
* is an interactive language, like BASIC
* is compiled each time you press the enter key, unlike BASIC.

'''Topic 3: Circular functions and trigonometry''' discusses functions based on the circle, how trigonometric functions are derived, and various trigonometric identities and rules.
{{TOC right}}
==3.1 The circle and radian measure==
'''Section content:''' ''The circle: radian measure of angles; length of an arc; area of a sector''

* 1 radian is defined as the angle that is subtended by an arc of a length equal to the radius of the circle. 180° = π radians.
* The angle θ radians subtended by an arc of length l in a circle of radius r is defined as: &lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{l}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The arc length l can be calculated using: &lt;math&gt;l = \theta r&lt;/math&gt;, where θ is in radians ''or'' &lt;math&gt;l = \frac{\theta}{360}(2\pi r)&lt;/math&gt;, where θ is in degrees. These are derived from the formula for the circumference of a circle. (The former equation is included in the formula booklet)
* The area of a sector is calculated using: &lt;math&gt;A = \frac{1}{2}\theta r^2&lt;/math&gt;, where θ is in radians ''or'' &lt;math&gt;A = \frac{\theta}{360}(\pi r^2)&lt;/math&gt;, where θ is in degrees. (The former equation is included in the formula booklet)

==3.2 Trigonometry as circular functions==
'''Section content:''' ''Definition of cos θ, sin θ and tan θ in terms of the unit circle; exact values of sin, cos and tan of 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2 and their multiples; definition of the reciprocal trigonometric ratios sec θ, csc θ and cot θ; Pythagorean identities''

Consider a unit circle (circle of radius 1) on a coordinate plane with centre at origin O(0, 0) and a point P(x, y) on its circumference. The angle θ is the angle made by OP from the positive x-axis and the angle α is the angle made by OP from the x-axis (either positive or negative). OP = 1 unit.
*In the first quadrant (0 &lt; θ &lt; π/2): &lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \frac{y}{OP} = y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \frac{x}{OP} = x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tan{\theta} = \frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;. All ratios are positive.
*In the second quadrant (π/2 &lt; θ &lt; π): &lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \sin{(\pi - \alpha)} = \frac{y}{1} = y = \sin{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \cos{(\pi - \alpha)} = \frac{-x}{1} = -x = -\cos{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tan{\theta} = \tan{(\pi - \alpha)} = \frac{y}{-x} = -\frac{y}{x} = -\tan{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. Only the sine ratio is positive.
*In the third quadrant (π &lt; θ &lt; 3π/2): &lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \sin{(\pi + \alpha)} = \frac{-y}{1} = -y = -\sin{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \cos{(\pi + \alpha)} = \frac{-x}{1} = -x = -\cos{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tan{\theta} = \tan{(\pi + \alpha)} = \frac{-y}{-x} = \frac{y}{x} = \tan{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. Only the tangent ratio is positive.
*In the fourth quadrant (3π/2 &lt; θ &lt; 2π): &lt;math&gt;\sin{\theta} = \sin{(2\pi - \alpha)} = \frac{-y}{1} = -y = -\sin{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \cos{(2\pi - \alpha)} = \frac{x}{1} = x = \cos{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tan{\theta} = \tan{(2\pi - \alpha)} = \frac{-y}{x} = -\frac{y}{x} = -\tan{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. Only the cosine ratio is positive.
'''Tip:''' These relationships are not found in the formula booklet. However, you can use ASTC (all, sine, tangent, cosine) to make a phrase to make this relationship with the quadrants easier to remember; for example: &quot;'''A'''dd '''s'''ugar '''t'''o '''c'''offee&quot;.

A straight line passing through the origin O(0, 0) has the equation &lt;math&gt;y = \tan{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.

Exact values for acute angles are summarised in the following table. Paper 1 uses this knowledge and you may also be asked to use this in Paper 2.

|}
'''Tip:''' The exact values of sine and cosine ratios are the reverse of each other, so you only have to remember one set of values. Also tan θ is just (sin θ)/(cos θ).

The exact values for angles greater than π/2 radians can be derived by using the quadrant relationships above.

The reciprocal trigonometric functions are:
*&lt;math&gt;\sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\csc{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sin{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\cot{\theta} = \frac{1}{\tan{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;
The first two of these are included in the formula booklet.

The Pythagorean identities are:
*&lt;math&gt;\cos^2 {\theta} + \sin^2 {\theta} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;1 + \tan^2 {\theta} = \sec^2 {\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;1 + \cot^2 {\theta} = \csc^2 {\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
All three of these are included in the formula booklet.

==3.3 Compound and double angle identities==
'''Section content:''' ''Compound angle identities; double angle identities''

The compound angle identities expresses trigonometric ratios of the sum of two angles in terms of ratios of separate angles. These are:
*&lt;math&gt;\sin{(A \pm B)} = \sin{A}\cos{B} \pm \cos{A}\sin{B}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\cos{(A \pm B)} = \cos{A}\cos{B} \mp \sin{A}\sin{B}&lt;/math&gt; (note that the signs between the terms are opposite of that in the original function)
*&lt;math&gt;\tan{(A \pm B)} = \frac{\tan{A} \pm \tan{B}}{1 \mp \tan{A}\tan{B}}&lt;/math&gt;
The proofs of these have been explicitly excluded from the syllabus.

The double angle identities can be derived from the compound angle identities. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Identity

|-
| &lt;math&gt;\sin{2\theta} = 2\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; 
| &lt;math&gt;\sin{(A + B)} = \sin{A}\cos{B} + \cos{A}\sin{B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sin{(\theta + \theta)} = \sin{\theta}\cos{\theta} + \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\therefore \sin{2\theta} = 2\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\cos{2\theta} = \cos^2 {\theta} - \sin^2 {\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos{2\theta} = 2\cos^2 {\theta} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos{2\theta} = 1 - 2\sin^2 {\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\cos{(A + B)} = \cos{A}\cos{B} - \sin{A}\sin{B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cos{(\theta + \theta)} = \cos{\theta}\cos{\theta} - \sin{\theta}\sin{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\therefore \cos{2\theta} = \cos^2 {\theta} - \sin^2 {\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

If we apply &lt;math&gt;\cos^2 {\theta} + \sin^2 {\theta} = 1&lt;/math&gt; we can get another two equivalent expressions:

&lt;math&gt;\cos{2\theta} = \cos^2 {\theta} - (1 - \cos^2 {\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\therefore \cos{2\theta} = 2\cos^2 {\theta} - 1&lt;/math&gt;

...and...

&lt;math&gt;\cos{2\theta} = (1 - \sin^2 {\theta}) - \sin^2 {\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\therefore \cos{2\theta} = 1 - 2\sin^2 {\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\therefore \tan{(2\theta)} = \frac{2\tan{\theta}}{1 - \tan^2 {\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\tan{(A + B)} = \frac{\tan{A} + \tan{B}}{1 - \tan{A}\tan{B}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tan{(\theta + \theta)} = \frac{\tan{\theta} + \tan{\theta}}{1 - \tan{\theta}\tan{\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\therefore \tan{(2\theta)} = \frac{2\tan{\theta}}{1 - \tan^2 {\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
All identities in this section are included in the formula booklet.

==3.4 Composite trigonometric functions==
'''Section content:''' ''Composite functions of the form f(x) = a sin(b(x + c)) + d''&lt;br&gt;
'''Rewind:''' [[IB Mathematics (HL)/Functions|2.3 - Transformation of graphs: translations; stretches; reflections in the axes]]

Consider a composite trigonometric function f where &lt;math&gt;f(x) = a\sin{(b(x + c))} + d&lt;/math&gt;
*|a| is the ''amplitude'', half the vertical distance between the maximum and minimum height. When a is negative the graph is also reflected along y = d.
*b is the ''number of cycles'' of the wave in the normal ''period'' (π radians for tangent, 2π radians for sine and cosine). The new period is hence the normal period divided by b i.e. in this case period = 2π/b.
*c is the ''phase shift'', or horizontal shift (to the left or right). When c is positive the graph moves to the left; when c is negative the graph moves to the right.
*d is the ''vertical shift'' (up or down). When d is positive the graph moves up; when d is negative the graph moves down.
'''Tip:''' The phase shift c is sometimes confused with bc due to the common perception that b = 1. Examination questions may trick you by expanding the expression in the trigonometric function. For example &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \sin{(2x + 8)}&lt;/math&gt;, c is not 8 but instead 8 divided by 2, which is 4.

==3.5 Inverse trigonometric functions==
'''Section content:''' ''The inverse functions arcsin x, arccos x, arctan x; their domains and ranges; their graphs''&lt;br&gt;
'''Rewind:''' [[IB Mathematics (HL)/Functions|2.1 - Inverse function, including domain restriction; 2.3 - The graph of the inverse function as a reflection in y = x]]

* The inverse trigonometric functions (arcsin x, arccos x and arctan x) finds the angle given the trigonometric ratio (sin θ, cos θ and tan θ respectively); it effectively is the reverse of the standard trigonometric functions.
* From topic 2.1 you would have known that inverse functions will only exist for one-to-one functions and not for many-to-one functions, hence in technicality the inverse of a trigonometric function is not a function. However the domain of f(x) can be restricted so that it becomes a one-to-one function and hence has an inverse.
* The domain of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the range of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and the range of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the domain of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the domain of arcsin x and arccos x is -1 ≤ x ≤ 1, while arctan x has the domain x: x exist for all real numbers.
* Alternative notation (especially on calculators; will also be used throughout the guide): &lt;math&gt;\arcsin{x} = \sin^{-1} {x} ; \arccos{x} = \cos^{-1} {x} ; \arctan{x} = \tan^{-1} {x}&lt;/math&gt;
* The graphs of the inverse functions can be obtained by first restricting the domains to -π/2 ≤ x ≤ π/2, then reflecting the graph in y = x.

==3.6 Solutions to trigonometric equations==
'''Section content:''' ''Algebraic and graphical methods of solving trigonometric equations in a finite interval, including the use of trigonometric identities and factorisation''&lt;br&gt;
'''Rewind:''' [[IB Mathematics (HL)/Functions|2.6 - Solving polynomial equations both graphically and algebraically; use of technology to solve a variety of equations, including those where there is no appropriate analytic approach]]

Trigonometric equations can be solved through algebraic and graphical means. To solve such an equation algebraically:
* The key idea is to have all trigonometric ratios reduced to the same basic one: either sine or cosine (or tangent if algebra forces it to sin θ/cos θ). Use the trigonometric identities to help you do so. If this is not possible it may be easier to use the graphical method of solutions.
* Usually this will reduce to a single linear equation. However it can also be reduced to a polynomial whereby x is replaced with a trigonometric function. In this case solve as you would with a standard polynomial equation e.g. by factorisation, quadratic formula or the binomial theorem. You could also use the graphing function of your GDC to solve the equation when it is too difficult to solve manually.
* After reducing to the form sin θ = x, check the domain - what do they want your answers to be in between? Use the quadrant relationships in 3.2 to help you solve the equation for that domain. For example, if the domain is π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 3π/2, then your solutions would be &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi - \sin^{-1}{x}, \pi + \sin^{-1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

To solve graphically, plot the left hand side of the equation as one graph and right hand side of the equation as another graph on the same pair of axes. Make sure that your GDC is on the correct angle mode (degrees or radians) - assume radians unless stated by the exam paper. The intersection points will be the solutions to the equation.

==3.7 Sine and cosine rules==
'''Section content:''' ''The cosine rule; the sine rule including the ambiguous case; area of a triangle as 1/2 ab sin C''

The sine and cosine rules relate the sides and angles in any triangle.

Consider a triangle ABC where a = BC, b = AC and c = AB.
* If you are given the lengths of any two sides a and b and the angle C between those two sides (the ''included angle''), then you can use the cosine rule to calculate the length of the remaining side c: &lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos{C}&lt;/math&gt;. A specific case of this is the Pythagoras' theorem for right-angled triangles, where C = π/2 radians or 90 degrees, then &lt;math&gt;c^2 = a^2 + b^2&lt;/math&gt;.
* If you are given the lengths of all three sides a, b and c, then you can use the cosine rule to calculate any angle within the triangle; for angle C this is: &lt;math&gt;\cos{C} = \frac{a^2 + b^2 - c^2}{2ab}&lt;/math&gt;.
* If you are given any two angles A and B and the length a side not in between these two angles - either a or b, then you can use the sine rule to calculate one of the missing sides: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{\sin{A}} = \frac{b}{\sin{B}} = \frac{c}{\sin{C}}&lt;/math&gt;.
* If you are given the lengths of any two sides a and b, and the angle A or B that is not in between the two sides, then this is known as the ''ambiguous case'' as the sine rule: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin{A}}{a} = \frac{\sin{B}}{b} = \frac{\sin{C}}{c}&lt;/math&gt; will result in two possible sizes for one of the missing angles: &lt;math&gt;A = \sin^{-1}{\frac{a\sin{B}}{b}}, \pi - \sin^{-1}{\frac{a\sin{B}}{b}}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, determine which one of the angles is not possible from the information given in the question.

The area of any triangle, given the lengths of any two sides a and b and the included angle C, is: &lt;math&gt;Area = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin{C}&lt;/math&gt;

These rules are given in the formula booklet.

== Re: Ancient History ==

Great to see you here! I haven't seen a proposal to move the book into becoming part of the broader book on World History, but I have thought about it. Reading the talk pages in Ancient History, I see there were disputes over what constitutes &quot;ancient&quot; history. Moving it into an-all inclusive history book might be better, and would resolve the issue of whether or not peoples like the Aztecs were &quot;ancient&quot;. What do you think?

== History of Greece ==

Just thought I'd let you know I added you to the list of contributors in [[History of Greece]], because the first five chapters of the Greek history book are the exact same pages that exist in [[Ancient History/Greece]], since it would be silly to have two separate pages on the same subject.

Hey there, I noticed that you've made significant contributions the Ancient History textbook. I am currently working with the [http://www.saylor.org/about/ Saylor Foundation] to create a similar textbook to host and use in our course on ancient civilizations on our website (which we offer free to anyone online). We would love for you to check out [[Saylor.org's Ancient Civilizations of the World]] and give us some feedback or make some contributions! --[[User:Azin|Azin]] ([[User talk:Azin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Azin|contribs]]) 19:13, 6 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

== About Me ==

My name is Andrew, and I teach history and English composition at a middle school.  I hold two master's degrees, in Christian theology and ancient history.  I'm thinking about getting a third in English literature.  I'm a fencing coach, a Boy Scout, and a freelance writer. 

=== What I'm Working On ===

I tried out [http://Wikipedia.org Wikipedia], to work on the free encyclopedia.  I liked it.  It's cool, and interesting.  Yet I discovered that I didn't have the heart to go in and do lots of editing of existing pages.  I'm a history teacher, and I do a lot of editing on student papers, which I find deeply frustrating. However, I discovered this [[Ancient History]] wikibook project was nearly empty.  The notion that this is something I can work on directly, in collaboration with peers and colleagues and talented amateurs, to bring the book into existence... That is a whole lot more exciting to me than constantly editing and revising, which is what I constantly do to my students' work.

After a long absence, I'm back.  I'm still working on [[Ancient History]] as my principal project, especially since I think it's particularly important given the OLPC project from MIT and Nicholas Negroponte.  Otherwise, this part of the study of history will likely vanish from the scene.  At the moment I'm planning on working on the [[Ancient History/Ancient Near East/Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient History/Rome|Rome]] sections.

== My Goal == 

My goal is to provide some basic text and stubs right now for this wikibook project, [[Ancient History]], so as to draw attention to the project and get others to contribute.  I hope this is acceptable, and I look forward to working with you all.

Also, I want to finish, and get into PDF format, [[How to write a research paper in History]], and maybe talk [[user:Fastfission|Fastfission]] back into collaborating on that project.  The book is 75%-80% complete, and I'd like to get it done across the board.

I'd also like to begin, organize, and get into PDF format, [[How to Study]] because this and [[How to write a research paper in History]] would be good books for me to use in class.  The existing copyright versions of such books are usually quite expensive, and having ones that I could photocopy and distribute would be useful.  I wouldn't mind doing a [[High School Guide to English Grammar]], either, but I'm going to finish my first three projects, or at least get some more people contributing to them, first.

==Voting Rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

I think this book is very useful for any person who either enjoys the bard or needs a copy of one of his plays and the play's history for a homework assignment. Needs much help on adding plays.[[User:Peteturtle|Brandon Johnsonn]] 20:04, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

'''Comments:'''
This book requires much work. There are good books for both Chinese and Japanese, but Korean has been neglected. For English-speakers trying to learn an oriental language, Korean is the most preferale because the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul Hangul] writing system is phonetic, and words are divided up into syllabic blocks.

So much to do and so little time... The mathematical approach in particular needs a lot of beefing up and elaboration in this book. The more helpers the better.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Us declaration independence.jpg|250px|thumb|The United States Declaration of Independence]]
Before the [[w:simple:United States|United States of America]] became its own country, it was made up of [[w:simple:Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]] (later to become the first thirteen U.S. states) that were part of the [[w:simple:British Empire|British Empire]]. On July 4, 1776, a group of people representing the interests of the various colonies (known as the [[w:simple:Continental Congress|Continental Congress]]) agreed to a joint statement known as the '''Declaration of Independence''' in which they declared the colonies to be free and independent states and explained their justifications for doing so. The anniversary of this declaration is now celebrated as [[w:simple:Independence Day|Independence Day]] in the United States.

A handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence signed by the members of the Continental Congress is on display in the [[../National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[w:simple:Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] It was the first of the three main Charters of Freedom, along with the [[../Constitution/]] and the [[../Bill of Rights/]].

==Background==
During the 1750s and 1760s, relations between Great Britain and thirteen British colonies along the eastern shore of North America became increasingly strained. Fighting broke out in 1775 at [[w:simple:Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]], marking the beginning of the [[w:simple:American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War]]. On January 10, 1776, [[w:simple:Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine]] published ([[wiktionary:simple:anonymous|anonymously]]) a [[wiktionary:simple:pamphlet|pamphlet]] titled ''[[w:Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' in which he outlined major problems with the British form of government (a [[w:constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchy]]) and several reasons the American colonies should separate themselves from Great Britain. Paine's pamphlet both reflected and influenced the growing anti-British sentiment in the colonies.

==Draft and adoption==
On June 11, 1776, a committee consisting of [[w:simple:John Adams|John Adams]] of Massachusetts, [[w:simple:Benjamin Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania, [[w:simple:Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] of Virginia, [[w:Robert Livingston (1746–1813)|Robert R. Livingston]] of New York, and [[w:Roger Sherman|Roger Sherman]] of Connecticut (known as the &quot;[[w:Committee of Five|Committee of Five]]&quot;), was formed to draft a formal resolution declaring the colonists' intent. The committee decided that Jefferson — its youngest member and the youngest signer of the final Declaration — would write the first draft of the resolution. After Franklin and Adams made several minor corrections, Jefferson produced another copy. The committee presented this version to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776.

Independence from Great Britain was declared on July 2, 1776. The full Declaration was rewritten somewhat in general session prior to its adoption by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as [[w:simple:Independence Hall|Independence Hall]]). Word of the Declaration reached London the following month, on August 10.

==Distribution and copies==
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, 1776, a handwritten draft of the Declaration of Independence was signed by the President of Congress, [[w:simple:John Hancock|John Hancock]], and the [[w:simple:secretary|secretary]] to Congress, [[w:Charles Thomson|Charles Thomson]]. It was sent a few blocks away to the printing shop of [[w:John Dunlap|John Dunlap]], who worked through the night to print 150 to 200 copies, now known as [[../Dunlap broadside|Dunlap broadsides]]. One of these was sent to [[w:simple:George Washington|George Washington]] on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. The 25 Dunlap broadsides still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

On July 19, 1776, Congress ordered a copy be handwritten for the delegates to sign. This engrossed copy of the Declaration was produced by Timothy Matlack, assistant to the secretary of Congress. Most of the delegates signed it on August 2, 1776, in geographic order of their colonies from north to south, though some delegates were not present and had to sign later. Two delegates never signed at all. As new delegates joined the congress, they were also allowed to sign. A total of 56 delegates eventually signed. 

The first and most famous signature on the engrossed copy was that of John Hancock of Massachusetts, President of the Continental Congress. Two future presidents, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, were among the signatories. Edward Rutledge (age 26), was the youngest signer, and Benjamin Franklin (age 70) was the oldest signer. 

In January 1777, Congress decided the Declaration should be more widely distributed. Printer Mary Katherine Goddard was commissioned to print a version containing the text and names of the signatories. Today, these copies are known as the &quot;[[../Goddard broadside|Goddard broadsides]]&quot;. Nine copies are known to still exist.

In 1823, printer William J. Stone was commissioned by Secretary of State John Quincy Adams to create an engraving of the document essentially identical to the original. Stone's copy was made using a wet-ink transfer process, where the surface of the document was moistened, and some of the original ink transferred to the surface of a copper plate which was then etched so that copies could be run off the plate on a press. Because of poor conservation of the 1776 document through the 19th century, Stone's engraving, rather than the original which has largely faded, has become the basis of most modern reproductions.

==Text and analysis==
The text of the Declaration of Independence can be divided into five sections: the introduction, the preamble, the indictment of George III, the denunciation of the British people, and the conclusion. (Note that these five headings are not part of the text of the document.) 
===Introduction===
: ''In CONGRESS, July 4 1776''
: ''The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,''
: ''When, in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to assume, among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the Causes which impel them to the Separation.''

In this section, the signers declare their independence from the [[w:British|British]] and prepare to state why they feel compelled to do so.

===Preamble===
: ''We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.''
: ''That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.''
: ''Prudence indeed, will dictate, that Governments long established, should not be changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer, while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security.''

[[Image:George III of the United Kingdom-e.jpg|150px|thumb|[[w:King George III|King George III]], the British king who was ruling over the 13 colonies when they declared independence.]]
This section is presented as a syllogism, with one proposition leading to another proposition. From the first proposition (that all men are created equal), a chain of logic is produced that leads to the right and responsibility of revolution when a government becomes destructive of the people's rights. 
===Indictment===
: ''Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The History of the Present King of Great-Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, all having in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let the Facts be submitted to a candid World.''
: ''He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public Good.''
: ''He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing Importance, unless suspended in their Operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.''
: ''He has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation of large Districts of People; unless those People would relinquish the Right of Representation in the Legislature, a Right inestimable to them, and formidable to Tyrants only.''
: ''He has called together Legislative Bodies at Places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the Depository of their public Records, for the sole Purpose of fatiguing them into Compliance with his Measures.''
: ''He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly Firmness his Invasions on the Rights of the People.''
: ''He has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the Dangers of Invasion from without, and Convulsions within.''
: ''He has endeavoured to prevent the Population of these States; for that Purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations hither, and raising the Conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.''
: ''He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.''
: ''He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and Amount and Payment of their Salaries.''
: ''He has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance.''
: ''He has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies, without the consent of our Legislature.''
: ''He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.''
: ''He has combined with others to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislaton:''
: ''For quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us:''
: ''For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:''
: ''For cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:''
: ''For imposing taxes on us without our Consent:''
: ''For depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:''
: ''For transporting us beyond the Seas to be tried for pretended Offences:''
: ''For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example and fit Instrument for introducing the same absolute Rule in these Colonies:''
: ''For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:''
: ''For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with Powers to legislate for us in all Cases whatsoever.''
: ''He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.''
: ''He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our Towns, and destroyed the Lives of our People.''
: ''He is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to complete the Works of Death, Desolation, and Tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized Nation.''
: ''He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the Executioners of their Friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.''
: ''He has excited domestic Insurrections among us, and has endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.''
: ''In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury. A Prince, whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People.''

In this section, the signers then list 27 grievances against the British Crown. The grievances are directed personally at the King (as in &quot;He has refused his Assent to Laws...&quot;), although many of them refer to actions taken by the British Parliament or the Royal Governors. Many of the grievances are examples of violations of fundamental English law, such as &quot;imposing taxes on us without our Consent&quot;, and &quot;depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury&quot;. Many historians maintain that some of the grievances are exaggerated propaganda (such as the &quot;Swarms of Officers&quot; in truth referring to about fifty men ordered to prevent smuggling). 

===Denunciation===
: ''Nor have we been wanting in Attentions to our British Brethren. We have warned them from Time to Time of Attempts by their Legislature to extend an unwarrantable Jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the Circumstances of our Emigration and Settlement here. We have appealed to their native Justice and Magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the Ties of our common Kindred to disavow these Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our Connections and Correspondence. They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the Necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of Mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends.''

[[Image:Syng inkstand.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Declaration of Independence and the [[../Constitution/]] were signed with the [[../Syng inkstand/]], which is on display at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.]]
This section is a message to King [[w:George III|George III]] that the 13 colonies are no longer a part of the [[w:British Empire|British Empire]] and that they do not want to have anything to do with the British.

===Conclusion===
: ''We, therefore, the Representatives of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in GENERAL CONGRESS, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by the Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly Publish and Declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES; that they are absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political Connection between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as FREE AND INDEPENDENT STATES, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT STATES may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of the divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.''

:: [Georgia:] ''Button Gwinnett, Lyman Hall, George Walton''

In this section, the signers assert that (since conditions exist under which people must change their government, and the British have produced such conditions) the colonies must necessarily throw off political ties with the British Crown and become independent states. The conclusion contains, at its core, the [[w:Lee Resolution|Lee Resolution]] that had been passed on July 2. The signatures have been listed here labeled with the states each group of delegates came from; this is not seen on the original Declaration.

==Text on the back of the document==
If you have watched the movie [[w:National Treasure (film)|National Treasure]], you may think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. However, that is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map. Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words &quot;''Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776''&quot;. The text appears on the bottom of the document, upside down. While no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, the large parchment document (it measures 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage. So, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.

[[Image:Declaration of Independence (USA).jpg|250px|thumb|A facsimile of the original draft with images of the signers around the border]]
==Differences between draft and final versions==
The Declaration went through three stages from conception to final adoption:
#Jefferson's original draft.
#Jefferson's draft with revisions from Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.
#The final version, which included changes made by the full Congress.

Jefferson's original draft included a denunciation of the slave trade (''&quot;He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life &amp; liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating &amp; carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither.&quot;''), which was later edited out by Congress, as was a lengthy criticism of the British people and parliament. According to Jefferson:
*&quot;The pusillanimous idea that we had friends in England worth keeping terms with, still haunted the minds of many. For this reason those passages which conveyed censures on the people of England were struck out, lest they should give them offense.&quot;

==Myths==
Several myths surround the document:
*Because it is dated ''July 4, 1776'', many people believe it was signed on that date&amp;mdash;it was signed August 2 by most of the delegates.
*An unfounded legend states that John Hancock signed his name so large that King [[w:George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] would be able to read it without his spectacles. In point of fact, other examples of his signature indicate that he typically signed his name in this way.
*Much like the previous, another myth states that John Hancock had bad eyesight himself and was therefore forced to sign his name large. This is, of course, not verified.
*The famous painting by John Trumbull, which hangs in the grand Rotunda of the Capitol of the United States, is usually incorrectly described as the signing of the Declaration, when what it actually shows is the five-man drafting committee presenting their work. Trumbull depicts most of the eventual signers as being present on this occasion, but this gathering never took place. An image of the painting can be seen in an earlier section of this article.
*The [[w:Liberty Bell|Liberty Bell]] was not rung to celebrate independence, but to call the local inhabitants to hear the reading of the document on July 8, and it certainly did not acquire its crack on so doing; that story comes from a children's book of fiction, ''Legends of the American Revolution'', by George Lippard. The Liberty Bell was actually named in the early nineteenth century when it became a symbol of the anti-slavery movement .

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Subpages}}
Welcome to the Composition Wikibook, where you can learn about the skills required for various kinds of composition writing and can practice planning, drafting, redrafting and proofreading compositions. 

===Things to remember before you get started:===

Writing should be seen as a process that involves several stages, from formulating your ideas through planning, drafting, redrafting and proofreading. An in depth guide to process writing is available at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rhetoric_and_Composition Rhetoric and Composition Wikibook]. The focus in this wikibook is on practical exercises to provide students with opportunities to apply the writing skills that they can learn about by following this and other links in the book.

===Format===
Be aware of the layout which you are expected to use when writing for different purposes. The layout of a formal letter to a newspaper will be very different from that of a postcard to your best friend.

===Audience and Purpose===
Make sure you have a good idea of who you are writing to/for and why. Are you trying to persuade, argue, inform, advise, or narrate a story? Are you writing to someone you know well or someone you have never met? Are you writing '''to''' someone in a position of authority, or '''as''' someone in a position of authority? To one person or many?

===Plan===
Plan. Decide on the main ideas that you want to include and the order in which they should be included. This can be done in the form of a list, but a mind-map may be more helpful.  Traditional outlines work well for longer essays.  

More about mind maps:  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map Wikipedia Mind Map Article]

===Draft===
Write a rough draft. Get your ideas down on paper (or onto your computer) as quickly as possible. Remember, at this stage your writing doesn't have to be perfect - so don't get stuck on how to form the ideal phrase.

It helps at this stage if you remember the golden rule of writing: KISS: &quot;Keep it simple, stupid!&quot; 

The following guide is very useful for helping you to keep your writing clear, simple and to-the-point:

[http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/plainenglishguide.html Plain English Guide]

===Review===
Read through your work. Underline places where grammar or phrasing seems awkward, where you feel you could add more detail or description, or where you feel it would be more effective if you were more concise. While doing this, try to imagine that you are the person for whom the writing is intended. If you received this piece of writing in the post, saw it in a newspaper, or had to hear it being delivered as a speech, would it make sense to you? Would you respond positively to it?

Do you overuse any particular words or sentence patterns? Using a variety of linking phrases and sentence structures - i.e. simple, compound and complex sentences - will make your writing more varied and less boring.

These guides will help:
[http://web.archive.org/20021020223606/www.geocities.com/fifth_grade_tpes/sentence2.html Sentence Types Guide and Exercise]

[http://www.eslbee.com/sentences.htm Sentence Types - Guide and Quiz] Bonesaw

A thesaurus such as [http://www.thesaurus.com www.thesaurus.com] can help you to avoid repeating words, but be careful that you are choosing alternative words that have the right tone and fit the context.

===Organize===
Ask yourself: is the writing coherent (does it make sense when you read it)? Does it have a beginning, a middle and a conclusion? Does each paragraph focus on one main idea, clearly marked by a '''topic sentence''' ''(the first sentence of the paragraph- it explains what the rest of the paragraph will be about)'' and the effective use of linking phrases? If it doesn't, fix it!

===Redraft===
Go through the parts of your work that you have underlined and rewrite them. You should do this as often as possible.

===Proofread===
Check for grammar and spelling mistakes. Sometimes it helps if you do this by working backwards from the bottom of your composition. That way, your attention on proofreading is less likely to be distracted by the flow of ideas.

[http://www.bbc.co.uk/skillswise/words/writing/proofreading/worksheet.shtml Easy proofreading practice]

[http://www.tcet.com/eaonline/TerribleTeacher/index.html Focused proofreading, looking for specific errors.]

[http://www.penandpage.com/EngMenu/prfread.htm More advanced proofreading practice.]

===Editing Pages in this Wikibook===

The sample compositions in this Wikibook are rough first drafts. They contain many errors and need to be extensively edited and enhanced. Please do not make changes to improve the first draft - but rather, do your editing work on the most recent draft on the screen. As many students may be working on these compositions at the same time, please edit by selecting the section you wish to edit and then clicking the edit icon on the right hand side of the screen directly above it. Please do not edit by selecting 'edit this page' at the top of the screen, as this will make it difficult for other people to work on the compositions at the same time as you.

== Advice on Style ==

Keep your writing simple. Each sentence should contain one main idea. Sentences do not need to be long or complicated in order to do this.

Write complete sentences.

Avoid pretentious, silly language. Try not to use a long and difficult word when you can express the same idea more clearly with a short, easy word. Try not to use unusual, confusing metaphors.

Avoid biased, opinionative writing. Report objectively on events and let the facts speak for themselves.

Avoid the passive voice unless you have to use it. 

Avoid obsequious, lengthy acknowledgments of advisors, teachers in charge of activities and so forth.

Avoid exaggerating or lying. Do not write simply for the sake of filling space. If there is very little to say about something, then say very little about it.

Avoid writing anything rude, offensive or vain.

Many of these ideas are taken from George Orwell's essay, Politics and the English Language - a must read for anyone interested in writing professionally. Read the essay here: [http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/essays/politics-english-language1.htm] 

'''Here’s an example of bad style:'''

A touch of lipsticks, a pat of powder on our so beautiful faces, eyebrows plucked, hairs all in place. A final look into the mirror: perfect faces for the evening. Dressing in lavish, shimmering gowns, as beautiful as angels on the tops of Christmas trees, the F. 5 girls sallied forth into the Conrad International Hotel for the celebration of their magnificent schooldays. There was an air of excitement filling the air in addition to the scrumptious aroma of the exquisite selection on the buffet counter. It was the much anticipated Graduation Dinner.

'''''Far better would be:'''''

The F. 5 Graduation Dinner took place on Friday, 26th June in the Harbour View Ballroom of the Conrad International Hotel, where graduating students enjoyed a sumptuous buffet.  The F. 5 girls wore formal evening gowns for the occasion, and also put a lot of effort into preparing their hair and make-up. Everyone looked splendid. 

'''Another example:'''

The stamp-collecting club has as its aim and objective to promote interest in stamp-collecting. Although being the co-ordinator of stamp-collecting club has not been an easy task for me because of I had to organise many activities that related to stamp-collecting, but I learnt about leadership skills. This has been a very fruitful year for our club and all our members successfully collected stamps. I would like to thank my members for their eager stamp-collecting skills and my dearest vice-chairlady, secretary and PRO for their tireless efforts in trying to assist me in running this important activity.  Also, we must express our sincere and heartfeltest gratitude to our teacher advisor, Mr. Terence Stamp.  Without you our club would not have been so successful!!! We LOVE you, Mr. Stamp!

'''''This would be far better:'''''

This year has been very successful for the stamp-collecting club.  We were able to attract more than 50 students to join the club, and our increased membership has made it possible for us to organize a wider range of activities than in previous years.  Students particularly enjoyed the visit to the General Post Office in December and the talk on first-day covers by Mr. Wally Tang, the chairman of the Hong Kong Philately Society, in March. We are very grateful to Mr. Stamp for his help in organizing these activities.

Tips for Proofreading

Cross out of unnecessary words.
Mark the position a missing word with an upside down letter y.
Then write the missing word above symbol.
Underline words which need to be changed.
Then write the correct words above it.
If a sentence is correct, write a tick beside it.
Pay attention of mistakes like wrong prepositions
as well as the watching out for unnecessary articles.
Look out missing prepositions, too.
One of the mistakes are likely to be subject-verb agreement.
Next most common mistake is a missing article.
You are also likely to notice of unnecessary prepositions.
Is easy to spot missing pronouns and you should also spot
The use of plural noun instead of singular nouns
Or when the examiner had used the wrong tense.
Try to read through the passage for several times.
Each time you can focus at a different kind of mistake.
Remember to make changes which change the meaning
and that the passage should be logically inconsistent.
Remember that because the proofreading task is at 
the end of the paper, you should never allow 
sufficient time to complete them.

How would you turn these rough notes into compositions?

'''A Person I Admire''' 

''Where can you find answers to these questions? How would you make sure that you present the information in your own words?''
Stephen Hawking - Scientist (what discoveries?)  - Overcame    
disability (which one? how long? how severe?)  - Background - where born? when? what did he study? family life?  - Why I admire him:  What we can learn from his example: 

'''My Favourite Restaurant'''

''In what order should the points be made? How would you divide this into paragraphs? How can you use descrip[tion to make the place sound appealing?''
When I visited:   Service:   Atmosphere:  Name of restaurant:  Decoration:   Value for money?   
Who should go: Types of food:   Location:

Draft your answers here:
===A Person I Admire===

=== A Person I Admire: David Beckham ===

I admire David Beckham because he is very handsome and his football skills is (s/v agreement) very good!  

As he gets older, he finds that his good looks can only carry him this far.  Moving to LA to play football was a strange move, especially (spelling) since soccer is hardly a popular sport in the US.  Was that a publicity move instead?  Perhaps he and his skinny wife wants to get into Hollywood?
Perhaps he should rely on his mean goal kicks......
In short, I '''admire''' (why past tense?) David Beckham. (is this conclusion just a repetition?)

''This makes a few interesting observations, but a lot is missing - an outline of his career and specific details about his achievements, for example. For a piece of writing on why you admire Beckham, it also seems rather negative!''

===My Favourite Restaurant===

== Newspaper Article (First Draft)==

'''A Dog Jumped Into A Pool'''

On Friday 29th April there was swimming gala. All the students cheering for there house and singing school song when someone shouted that she can see a dog. And that dog jumped into the swimming pool. Then Mr. Jones was very brave he was the announcer for the swimming gala and he saw the dog swimming in the pool. 

Immediately he didn’t think and he jumped into the water to rescue the dog. After that the dog was very afraid and bit him so he had to go to hospital. A doctor told us that Mr. Jones bit the dog and drank the water in the swimming pool. Mr Jonnes is lucky because the St John’s Ambulance workers could bring him out the pool. Or he would drown.That naughty dog ran away.

Also some students were chewing gum at the swimming gala. People who live near the park complained to the police because the cheering teams were very noisy.At last, Jupiter came first with 650 points. Yeah! Jupiter Forever!

=== Newspaper Article (Second Draft) ===

''This has fewer grammar mistakes, now, but does it have the right tone for a newspaper article? Is it unbiased and objective? Does it have all the important information for a news story? Could some less important information be left out?''

=== Dog Bites Teacher at Swimming Gala ===

=== *** ===
A dog attacked a teacher April 29 during the Marymount swimming gala at Victoria Park public pool. The incident took place as students cheered and sang for their respective houses. Witnesses, including the victim, Mr. Jones, claimed they saw the animal jump into the pool and swim.

===***===
Mr. Jones said the frightened dog bit him after he jumped into the pool to save the animal. Jones was transported by ambulance to ABC hospital, where staff treated his wound and cleared his lungs of excess water.

===***===
Furthermore, some students were cheering too loud during the swimming gala. People who live near the park complained to the police that the Marymount cheering teams were very noisy, disturbing them. The principal punished the whole school after the swimming gala. At last, Jupiter came first with 650 points. Obviously the students of Jupiter are strong and good.

== Letter to a Newspaper: Cyber Cafes (First Draft) ==

(Please do not edit this version - work on the latest draft)

I am writing to express my views towards the increasingly common of cyber cafes, karaokes and electronic game centres. According to the violent cases happened recently in a cyber cafe, two form three students were being injured. Although no people died in this accident, we should not ignore the bad effects behind.

For computers, we cannot live without being insulated with them. If students got addicted to lingering in cyber cafes, and enjoy exposing too much to the computer world, infers that less time will be spent on students’ own studies and this may cause low incentive in studying. Following will be poor performances at class, appalling results in exams and poor relation with teachers. Instead of entertaining, they should focus more on their academic.

Secondly is about the problem of health. The number of students are found to be buried themselves in cyber cafes. Cyber cafes are usually found in the old buildings or in some of the commercial buildings. There is no window found. As a result, the ventilation of air is poor enough to cause the non-smoker feel sick. According to my biological knowledge, breathing in too much smoke disposed from the cigarettes would become more easily to be suffered from cancer. Another problem is the safety. Many cyber cafes are opened without lifeguard equipment. This can be fatal if fire accident happens.

As there is a new cyber café opens near my school, I decidied to go there to a try. The services of the waiters were bad, and the food, Oh my god! You just can’t put them into your mouth, they were not for humans. Due to the reasons there were someone stearing at us, we therefore keep silent. When I passed through the kitchen I saw crouchates everywhere. (What I think is I’m in a black shop!) 

When we decided to pay the bill, to our surprised it costed as almost $80 per person, even they said to have discounts.

Moreover, children under 18 are inquisitive during purberty and may get some wrong and indecent knowledge from computer. We should give a correct guidance to youngsters. And they should be forced to ban any pronographic webpage. This is not just a need, but a must.

Students may know some bad guys in the internet, too. Many bad businessmen make good use of the trend and do guilty things. They do not concern about students. There will be stealing, bullying and sexual disturbance. Government  must monitor cyber cafes inorder to avoid these people to control the cafes leading to any other crimes.

===Letter to the Newspaper - Cyber Cafes (Second Draft)===

''This is improving, but there are still many grammar mistakes and problems with awkward, unidiomatic phrasing - I have highlighted these. Could the message be conveyed more simply and directly? Is there a clear conclusion?''

===***===
I am writing to express my views '''about''' the increasing '''number''' of incidents '''which happen in''' cyber cafes, karaoke bars and electronic game centres. '''According to (wrong expression)''' the violent cases '''(missing pronoun)'''happened recently in a cyber cafe, two form three students were injured.

===***===
Secondly '''is (what is?)'''  about the problem '''on (wrong preposition)''' health. Students are found to be '''burying themselves (sounds a bit extreme!)''' in cyber cafes. Cyber cafes are usually found in  old commercial buildings. '''There aren't any windows (is this always true?)'''. As a result, the '''ventilation of air (can anything other than air be ventilated?)''' is so poor that '''(missing subject)'''causes the non-smokers to feel sick. '''According to my biological knowledge, (do you need to sound so technical?)''' breathing in too much smoke '''disposed by the cigarettes (is it? how would cigarettes do this?)''' '''would be likely to suffer (parallelism: who would suffer?''' from lung cancer. Another problem is safety. Many cyber cafes are opened without '''lifeguard (sounds like they are swimming pools!)''' equipments. This can cause '''fatal (word form)''' if '''fire accidents happened. (awkward: one word is redundant and the tense seems wrong)'''
'''Bold text'''SECOND IS THE PROBLEM OF HEALTH.STUDENTS OFTEN FOUND THEMSELVES BOURING IN THE CYBERCAFE.CYBER CAFE USUALLY HAVE NO VENTILATIONS AND NON SMOKERS OFTEN FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AS IT HAS NO WINDOW AND IT IS IN COMMERCIAL COMPLEXES.SOMKING IN PUBLIC PLACES CAUSES LUNG CANCER TO MEN.SAFETY IS THE OTHER THING WHICH THE CYBERCAFE DOESNOT HAVE AS IT OFTEN OPEN TOWARDS SWIMMING POOL AND HAVE NO LIFE SAVING EQUIPMENT CAUSING ACCEDENTS.

===***===
'''As there is a new cyber café opened (stick to subject+verb+object)''' near my school, I decided to go there '''for a try (wrong expression)'''.

'''Moreover, children under 18 are inquisitive during puberty and may get some wrong and indecent information from the internet. We should give suitable guidance to youngsters. And any pronographic (spelling) webpages should be banned.

Dear Mr. Kwok

I am sorry about you are unhappy with your holiday in your letter on 5th September but I think that we have some misunderstandings. You recently went on one of our tours to Cebu and you can only say you had a terrible time and hold our company responsible, but isn’t this unfair? 

Some of those matters are beyond our control. First of all, the flight was delayed and the airline and airport should be responsible for that, so we are sorry about the inconvenience this caused to you. Also, you can’t expect us to make the weather sunny while you are on holiday. Didn’t you know August is the rainy season in Philippines? Anyone could have told you that. Then, we don’t decide how much duty to pay – the Hong Kong Government is responsible for this and information is provided in every duty free shops. We are sorry about that and will try to prevent this from happening again in future. Finally, we didn’t lose your luggages. When you saw that you should have reported to the airport staff immediately. If I were you, I would read the back of my ticket more carefully next time.
______________________________________________________________________
Unfortunately, you didn’t read our tour pamphlet as it states that economic transport is being offered. We apologise that we did not fly first class because it is not economical enough and group member wants to have single room preferred must pay $500 in advance because this is the low season price. According to our records you are male and 41 years old but you are not allergic to seafood because other passengers can remember to make a special request such as Muslim no pork and vegetarian single room etc. but not you.  

Tours and excursions have to pay 24 hours advance, so if you cannot.  Perhaps if you don’t like seafood you shouldn’t go to Cebu next time as our brochure stated that you can have your breath taken away by the corals and enjoy nightly seafood barbecues, succulent shrimps and lobsters fresh from the sea.
______________________________________________________________________

Let me refer you to our medical policy about your doctor in Cebu with an old kidney problem. It states that all members of the tour are covered by a group insurance policy but the policy does not cover any illness or medical conditions known to the tour members before the tour, and the insured must pay the first $1000 himself. The insurance company will pay any further receipted expenses up to $50000 and in the event of death will pay up to $80000 in funeral expenses, but since you are not dead and your doctor charged you less than $1000 this is not necessary.

Finally, I would like to apologize to the tour guide about he has been incredibly rude and nasty to you. We have taken appropriate disciplinary measure, but when we fried him he told us you are a real pain, that nobody liked you and that you never stopped complaining. Don’t you know that you are on a cheap low season package? I am sorry that you are frustrated, but everyone else was happy and reasonably priced.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr. Tai

====***====
We are sorry that you are unhappy with your holiday in Cebu as stated in your letter on 5th September. However, having read your complaints I think that you may have some misunderstandings about the nature of the tour and our liability to you.

====***====

We would like to point out that some of the matters which you complained about are beyond our control. First of all, while we regret the inconvenience caused by the flight being delayed, the airline is responsible for this, so if you wish to seek compensation for the delay, you should pursue the matter with the airline rather than with us. Also, the weather is clearly not something which we can be held responsible for. We have already included the weather facts of the Philippines in 'Guide Book to the Philippines' which has stated very clearly that the Philippines has heavy rainfall in summer, so that our customers can be awarded of it. And we assumed that it was clear enough for our customers. We will be more considerate in the future and will make sure that everyone who goes on the tour is clearly awarded of that.

====***==== 

The Hong Kong Government decides how much we need to pay for stamp duty and this information is provided at every duty free shop. Finally, when you realised that you had lost your luggages, you should have reported to the airline ground staff immediately. This information was printed on the back of your ticket. 

====***====

Unfortunately, you did not read our tour brochure as it states that the economy class is being offered. We apologise that we did not provide the first class flight, but it's clearly stated in our brochure that if customers wish to make an upgrade to their transportation, booking should be done 24 hours in advance, and it also states that if group member wants to have single room, they would have to pay $500 as a supplement. According to our special requests list, there are no special requests being made by you. Special requests should be made if you have any sorts of food allergy, or have other requests such as requesting for a single room etc. in advance.   

====***====

We regret to tell you that you are not eligible to get the refund of the medical service related to your kidney problem. As stated in the medical policy note issued before departure, any illnesses or medical conditions known to the tour members before the tour will not be covered. As your condition is an old problem, the insurance company does not have the responsibility to cover the cost in this case.

====***====

Finally, we would like to apologize for the rudeness of the tour guide. Your feedback of the tour has been taken into consideration and we have already taken appropriate disciplinary measures. We are sorry that you are frustrated. 

Yours sincerely,



Walter Kwok

(Please do not edit this version. Make changes to the latest version. I have highlighted some of the things that need to be fixed.)

Dear Pat,

Hi there! I’m Chris. How are you? I know that you are studying overseas but plans to return to Hong Kong during the summer holidays to look for a summer job and not sure how to find a suitable one. Is it right? It cannot be denied that this is a crucial decision. My dear Pat, I hope you will allow me to be frank: the moment I read your letter it became apparent to me that you are at a critical turning point in your life and, to coin a phrase, you are on the horns of a dilemma. I hope that what I have to tell you will assuage your anxiety. 

First, for what types of jobs are suitable. I think you can become a salesman because if you work in a department store or a shop, you can meet a lot of people '''in the society'''. Or '''if you work as an assistant officer, it may be a good choice''' because '''you are comfortable''' to work in an office. You are good '''at''' English, Geography and Mathematics and passed your GCSE '''successfully.''' You can be a tutor and teach '''the''' younger children. Or you can '''work as a surveyor for the Lands Department during the summer holiday'''.

Then,''' how to get them.''' Hong Kong is '''suffering an economic depression and unemployment rate becomes higher and higher'''. Even university '''students can’t find a job for their living'''. Don’t expect '''it to be easy''' to get '''those''' well paid jobs. But if you '''tried hardly''', I think you can get some jobs that are suitable '''to''' you. 

First, you must decide what '''is your interest and ability.''' You must '''apply a job''' that suits these. Look '''on''' the newspaper for adverts '''of''' the recruitment '''session''' or visit '''to''' the Labour Department. Write a CV which '''says''' your '''qualification''' and '''experiences'''. If you are asked to '''conduct''' an interview, remember to dress '''up''' smartly and do '''researches''' about the company. Remember to ask about training '''opportunity''' and your '''promotion prospect. (in a summer job?)'''

'''About which ones should be avoided'''. First of all, if you '''are''' just returned from studying overseas, I don’t think you know enough about local culture – so don’t get a job as a '''tourist'''. Reject those jobs like modelling '''agencies''' that ask you to pay a training fee before you start work. Many teenagers are attracted '''for''' this and it is a trap. And don’t take up those '''black jobs''' like '''sell private''' CDs. You don’t want to''' hold''' a criminal record at your age.

Good luck with finding '''for''' a job. Please contact me when you arrive in Hong Kong. Then, we can '''find for''' a job together. '''I am looking forward to receiving your reply. Thank you for your kind attention.
						
Yours sincerely, (are you writing to a friend?)'''

''This is much better than the first version, but there are still occasions when the tone is condescending and unfriendly, when phrasing is awkward, or when excessive use of cliches makes the letter sound silly. Also, is the advice realistic, given that the letter is supposed to be about temporary summer jobs?''
===***===
Dear Pat,

I hope that you are doing well and that you have been having a good time in London. Have you finished your A Levels yet? In your last letter, you told me that you are planning to go back to Hong Kong during the summer holiday to look for a summer job.  Unfortunately,  you aren't sure how to find a suitable one.  It cannot be denied that this is a crucial decision. My dear Pat, I hope you would allow me to be frank: the moment I was reading your letter it became apparent to me that you are at a critical turning point in your life and, to coin a phrase, you are on the horns of a dilemma. I hope that what i am going to tell you will comfort you.

===***===
First, you should look for jobs that are suitable for you. I think you can be a saleswoman because when you are working in a department store or a shop, you will have a lot of opportunies to meet a lot of people in the society. Being an assistant officer is also a good choice. You can work comfortably in an office. If you are good at English, Geography and Mathematics and passed your GCSE successfully, you can be a tutor and teach those young children. Or you can work as a surveyor for the Lands Department.

===***===
Then, how to get them. Hong Kong is suffering from an economic depression and the unemployment rate is becoming higher and higher. Even university students can’t find a job to make their living. Don’t expect you will easy to get those well paid jobs. But if you tried hardly, I think you can get a job that is suitable to you.

===***===
First, you must decide what are your interests and to consider your ability. You must apply for a job that suits you most. Look for the recruitment session in the newspaper or visit the Labour Department. Write a resume which includes your qualification and experiences. If you are being interviewed, remember to dress up properly and do some research on the company.

===***===
About which one should be avoided. First of all, if you are just returned from studying overseas, I don’t think you know enough about local culture – so don’t get a job as a tourist. Reject those jobs like modelling agencies that ask you to pay a training fee before you start working. Many teenagers are attracted to this but it is a trap. And don’t take up those black jobs like selling private CDs. You don’t want to hold a criminal record at your age.

Good luck with finding a job. Please contact me when you arrive in Hong Kong. Then, we can find a job together. I am looking forward to receive your reply. Thank you for your kind attention.

== 1998 Section E Practice: Task One ==

=== Poster 1 ===

==== Artist's aim ====
The artist drew a boy and a girl to draw both boys' and girls' attention to his message. The artist wants to tell everyone not to copy the characters in poster by showing how the boy behaved dangerously and how the girl wore unsuitable clothes.

The artist wants to tell everyone not to dress improperly or drive dangerously on a motorcycle like the boy and girl in the poster.

==== Teachers' reactions ====
The careers teacher, Miss So, thinks that some immature students might want to copy the dangerous acts as the artist seems to suggest that the behavior is smart and trendy. She suggests that the artist should redraw the poster to remove this idea.

The English teacher, Mr Fung, similarly criticizes the language used in the poster for being too wordy and complex. He suggests that the caption ought to be simplified as &quot;Dress properly!&quot;. 

==== Student questionnaire results ====

Most junior form students (approximately 80%) like the poster. It was equally popular with junior boys and girls. However, fewer than half of the senior students like the poster. Around 40% of senior boys and only around 25% senior girls like it.

==== Junior and senior students' comments during interviews ====
Two of the Junior form students find the words on the poster confusing.

Two senior form students said that they think that the characters on the poster set a negative example for the junior students.

==== The drawing ====

The drawing should be redesigned so as to avoid suggesting that dangerous driving is fun. 
The artist should rephrase the message to be more direct and simpler.
=== Poster 2 ===

==== Artist's aim ====
The artist wanted to show that young people should be actively involved with road safety and they should set a good example for others to follow.

==== Teachers' reactions ====
The careers teacher, Ms So, understands the artist's messages of drawing attention to the difficulty that many old people have when trying to cross a busy road. However, she feels that the helpful teenager should not be only a girl, boys should be included also.
The English teacher, Mr Fung, thinks that the caption should be rewritten as he's not sure who is saying it and it's not appealing.

==== Student questionnaire results ====

The poster appeals more to the senior forms. A clear majority of senior boys and girls like the poster, while a majority of junior girls and about a quarter of junior boys like it. Within both the junior and senior forms, there is a higher percentage of girls liking the poster than of boys.

==== Junior and senior students' comments during interviews ====
Most junior and senior students think that the aim of the poster is to show that girls are helpful but boys are not, instead of showing the importance of road safety.
Some students think that the poster contains elements of sexual discrimination.
The message of the poster is not clear for junior students.

==== The drawing ====
The poster should be redesigned so that it shows both girls and boys being helpful. The caption should be rewritten as well to show that road safety is important for everyone.

=== Poster 3 ===

==== Artist's aim ====
The artist shows teenagers not paying attention to useful advice. The artist wants to point out that everyone (including students) should learn about the importance of road safety.

==== Teachers' reactions ====
The careers teacher, Ms So, thinks that it is not fair for the teacher to only scold girls as both boys and girls are not paying attention in the poster. The caption suggests that only the girls need to pay attention in class, which is also discriminatory against girls.

Mr Fung, believes that the poster should clearly state that it is a road safety lesson, and because the wording of the poster is biased, it distracts people from the intended meaning.

As the artist wants to bring out the importance of road safety to both boys and girls, both teachers think the caption is inappropriate and should be changed.

==== Student questionnaire results ====
The results of the questionnaire show that more boys like the poster than girls do. There are fewer than 50 percent of boys and nearly 20% of girls in the junior forms who like the poster. In the senior forms most students dislike the poster. Only around 20% of boys and 10% of girls said that they liked it.

==== Junior and senior students' comments during interviews ====
Some students seem to think that the message brought out by the poster is rather unclear and confusing. They don't know whether the point of the poster is about 'road safety' or about 'paying attention in class'.
They also seem to think that the poster contains elements of sexual discrimination, as the teacher emphasizes that it's the girls who have to pay attention and they asked why this did not apply to both boys AND girls?

==== The drawing ====
The caption of the poster should be changed so that it doesn't have a biased implication. Also the wording should state clearly the subject of the poster, which is road safety.

=== Conclusion ===

Based on the above findings, poster 2 would be the most suitable as it was the most popular poster among students according to the questionnaire, and both teachers liked it more than the other designs. However, it needs to be improved by redesigning the picture to show that both boys and girls can contribute to road safety and rephrasing the caption to show that everyone should be involved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== localInstanceOfObject ===
==== Pierce T. Wetter III ====
I thought I'd expand on that last sentence because localInstanceOfObject seems to confuse multiple people.

localInstanceOfObject() actually returns a _fault_ from the new editing context for the passed in object.

If you have 2 peer contexts:

  databaseContext -&gt; ec1
                  -&gt; ec2

and you call localInstanceOfObject(), and the object is in the database, you'll get a copy of the databaseContext snapshot of the object when the fault resolves from ec2. That is, the editing context goes up one level to the database context and returns whatever the database context has, not whatever ec1 has (because they're peers). If its an uncommitted object, then the object only exists in ec1, so the fault can't resolve into ec2. Similarly, any uncommitted changes in general from ec1 won't show up in ec2, because they're peers.

What Mark just said was that if you have an uncommitted object, and you have:

  databaseContext -&gt; ec1 -&gt; ec2
                         -&gt; ec3

(i.e. ec2 and ec3 are child editing contexts of ec1, but peers of each other)

Then when the fault fires in ec3, it goes up one level, pulls the objects and changes from ec1 (committed or not) and returns it to you in ec3. But that only works because ec1 is common to both ec2 and ec3. In other word, localInstanceOfObject() returns an object from &quot;one level above&quot; the source editing context which is not necessarily a copy of the object you want, it depends on how the destination context lies with respect to the source context.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When the eigenvalue is repeated we have a similar problem as in normal differential equations when a root is repeated, we get the same solution repeated, which isn't linearly independent, and which suggest there is a different solution.  Because the case is very similar to normal differential equations, let us try &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{u} t e^{\mathbf{\lambda}t}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}' = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; and we see that this does not work; however, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = (\mathbf{B} t + \mathbf{C}) e^{\mathbf{\lambda}t}&lt;/math&gt; DOES work (For the observant reader, this gives a hint to the changes in the Method of Undetermined Coefficients as compared to differential equations without linear algebra).

In fact if we use this we see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is a typical eigenvector; and we see that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a normal eigenvector defined by &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{A} - \lambda \mathbf{I})\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus our fundamental set of solutions is:  &lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{u}te^{\lambda t} + \mathbf{n}e^{\lambda t};\mathbf{u}e^{\lambda t}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the same process of derivation, higher-order problems can be solved similarly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
We now tackle the problem of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}(t)&lt;/math&gt; being nonzero, so that we have the following problem:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}' = \mathbf{AX} + \mathbf{G}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

There are four reasonable ways to solve this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The geography of ancient Egypt was dominated, as is today, by the combination of lack of rainfall and the Nile River.  The Greek historian [[Ancient History/Bibliography#Herodotus|Herodotus]] called Egypt the &quot;gift of the Nile&quot;, since the kingdom owed its survival to the annual flooding of the Nile and the resulting depositing of fertile silt. The Nile River flows into the Mediterranean Sea, and there is a delta at the mouth.

== The Nile == 
[[Image:Nile River and delta from orbit.jpg|thumb|The green is the ancient Egyptian &quot;Black Land&quot;, while everything else is the &quot;Red Land&quot;]]
The Nile River was the only reason that civilization arose in ancient Egypt at all.  In the fourth century B.C., the Greek historian [[Ancient History/Biographical_Dictionary#Herodotus|Herodotus]] reported in his ''Histories'' that &quot;Egypt is the gift of the Nile.&quot;  He meant that Egypt received virtually no rain, and so all of its water — for drinking, washing, irrigation of crops and operation of water-wheels — came solely from this one river.  

===The Nile's physical/chemical properties===
Since the headwaters of the Nile are deep in central east Africa (at Lake Victoria), the river flooded annually during the height of Egyptian civilization.  Spring snowmelt in the Ethiopian highlands would gradually fill the river, and the Nile would gently rise.  Unlike Mesopotamia, where floods were irregular, unpredictable and highly destructive, the Nile washed over its banks to flood stage on a predictable schedule, usually within two or three days of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius in late July.  For a period of almost three thousand years, with relatively few interruptions, the ancient Egyptians could count on three months of high waters, from August to early November.  The '''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Inundation|Inundation]]''', as it was called, carried a rich bed of silt and alluvial soil onto the farmland of Egypt.  In this way, the farmland of Egypt was annually replenished and invigorated, making Egypt the garden-land of the ancient world.  

The Nile's annual Inundation thus established the pattern of Egyptian life very early.  Between August and November, when the fields were flooded, the Egyptians would work on building projects for the priesthoods and Pharaoh.  The pyramids at Giza and Sakkarha were built during the Inundation in all likelihood, as were the temples at Karnak and Luxor.  From November to March, farmers would re-establish their fields using geometry and markers placed on high points above the flood lines, and plant their crops.  March to June was the harvest season, in which grain and grape would be processed for bread, beer and wine, and Pharaoh's tax collectors would make their rounds.  In early July, people collected their tools and prepared for the next flood.

So constant was this pattern that its interruption may have caused the fall of several dynasties.   The most famous example of the Nile's failure to flood may have occurred during the later years of the reign of Pepi II, who reigned from the age of 6 until 96.  The Nile Inundation failed to arrive on time for several of the last years of his reign, and upon his death the Egyptian bureaucracy largely collapsed in power struggles with the country's nobility and priesthood.  Pepi II's death, and the resulting civil conflicts, are considered the end of the Old Kingdom period in Egyptian history.

== Four Divisions ==

Four divisions are useful in considering Egypt's geography.  The first division is between Upper and Lower Egypt, while the second is between the Red Land (''Desert'') and the Black Land (''Kemet'').  English speakers sometimes suffer confusion about the first division, because Upper Egypt is in the south, while Lower Egypt is in the north.  Upper or southern Egypt, is a narrow river valley, rarely more than twelve miles wide, and more frequently only one or two miles wide.  High cliffs hem it in on both sides.  Lower or northern Egypt is the broad delta above modern Cairo.  The land is flat and fertile, and the rich soil of the Inundation often winds up here.  It was richer but softer than Upper Egypt.

The second major division, between Red and Black Lands, is a division between the black and fertile soil of the Nile Valley, and the ruddy, sandy and arid wastes of the desert.  While oases existed in the western desert, the eastern desert was largely empty of habitation, except around a few mines and quarries for especially valuable stone.  The ancient Egyptians were wholly conscious of how much they lived in a narrow strip of farmland surrounded by hostile wilderness to the east and west.

Egypt's southern boundary, at the southern edge of Upper Egypt, was traditionally held to be the First Cataract. This was an area of harsh rapids and waterfalls some six hundred miles due south of the main exit point of the Nile into the Mediterranean.  During the Old Kingdom, this was Egypt's farthest extent.  During the Middle and New Kingdom periods, however, Egyptian armies pushed further south, as far as the Sixth Cataract, in an attempt to invade and conquer Nubia and Kush, two countries that lay farther south.  Kush is associated with present-day central Sudan, while some scholars place Kush in modern Ethiopia.

Relatively recent discoveries of small tombs in a pyramid style in Sudan suggest that while Egypt did not rule the lands south of the First Cataract, they did have cultural contacts in the deep south, and trade of both goods and ideas was quite common.

== Upper Egypt ==

Upper, or southern, Egypt, extended from Memphis in the north to Abu (Elephantine) in the south.  This is approximately the distance from the 30-degrees North line to the Tropic of Cancer.  The western oasis of Fayum is within this district, as are the major cities of Herakelopolis, Quis, Thinis, Abydos, Dendera, Nekhen/Hierakonpolis, and Edfu.

Upper Egypt is a narrow river valley, with steep cliffs rising on either side.  Numerous ''wadis'' feed into the Nile in this region, and the river itself is rarely more than a mile wide.  The valley is often as narrow as six or eight miles.

== Lower Egypt ==

Lower, or northern, Egypt is the delta. Almost three hundred miles across at the mouth of the Nile, the great fan-shaped region was the breadbasket of ancient Egypt and later of the Roman Empire.  Archaeology in Lower Egypt is difficult, since the regularly shifting paths of the rivers and the annual Inundation have often swept away both artifacts and buildings.

Ancient Egyptians referred to the deserts around their country as the ''desert'', meaning &quot;Red Land&quot;.  Hot and arid, the Red Land grew no food, and was thought to be a place of wildness and danger.  In contrast, the ''khemet'' or &quot;Black Land&quot; was the Nile valley, where the soil was black and moist, and life was capable of not only surviving, but thriving.  The Egyptian word ''khemet'' is thought to be the term from which the name Egypt springs.  

The desert provided Egypt with numerous products, despite its raw and wild nature.  Dry lake beds near the delta in Lower Egypt provided ''natron'', the salt used to preserve mummified corpses.  Quartzite for grinding and drilling tools, and limestone for building, came from a desert region northeast of Memphis.  Copper came from mines in the Sinai Peninsula and the eastern desert.  Alabaster for fine carvings came from near Cusae.  Granite quarries near the Red Sea provided stone for sculpture and construction.  Diorite for hammers and flint for stone knives traveled downriver from the region of the First Cataract.

Then there was gold.  It was said by a Hittite ruler that there was as much gold in Egypt as there was sand.  This enormous wealth, and the natural barrier of the deserts, allowed Egypt to carry out its natural role as the trade link between Africa and the Near East.  Gold purchased straight timber, a necessary but locally-unavailable commodity, as well as lapis lazuli, silver, ebony, ivory and olive oil.

==Red Lands==
The 'red land' was the barren desert that protected Egypt on two sides. These deserts separated ancient Egypt from neighbouring countries and invading armies. They also provided the ancient Egyptians with a source for precious metals and semi-precious stones.

==Black Lands==
The 'black land' was the fertile land on the banks of the Nile. The ancient Egyptians used this land for growing their crops. This was the only land in ancient Egypt that could be farmed because a layer of rich, black silt was deposited there every year after the inundation of the Nile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PDF accessibility features ==

Hello, I'm working in the [[w:Wikipedia:Accessibility|Wikipedia:Accessibility]] policy, and I would like to point PDF files have some nice [[w:Portable Document Format#PDF and accessibility|accessibility features]] that help people with disabilities (e.g. a blind user with a screen reader) and also provide some device independence (e.g. to read a wikibook in the 320&amp;times;240 screen of my hyper-cool new PDA/phone :-). Some wikibooks are currently created with this feature (e.g. [[Ada Programming]]), and from my POV it's a good idea to always generate the PDF versions with the &quot;accessibilty tags&quot; to provide document ''reflow'' (Spanish: &quot;reflujo&quot;). See http://www.adobe.com/uk/epaper/tips/acr5reflow/index.html for more info. Best regards --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 09:14, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

== Previous PDF Editions ==

Do we realy need that column at the &quot;Image:&quot; page of the pdf allready provided a history list. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== How can one contribute a book ==

I have authored a boob on Calculus and Differential Equation. The TeX source, PDF as well as Postscript version of the book with me. If I want to submit the book how can I upload it?

[[User:202.141.99.51|202.141.99.51]] 15:05, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

: I'm unsure if there is any easy way of converting TeX or Postscript to wiki markup. You could upload all three files (though you may have to split them up if they are too big) and then solicit other Wikibookians to help out transcribing the content. I would be willing to help out.
: To upload the files, you will need to sign up. Just click the link at the top right that says &quot;Log in / create account,&quot; click the link (in the center of the screen) that says &quot;Create an account,&quot; and fill in the information. Make sure to not put your e-mail address or real name in the &quot;username&quot; box if you do not want to reveal your identity. It would be great to have you on board! --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 19:41, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

Thanks dear for offering help. Well, while posting the above message, I had forgotten to login. I am already a contributor to many wikis (en, gu, books, wiktionaries,  and here too). I have the pdf format, is it not sufficient to upload the pdf file only? 

BTW: I am posting the same message to your talk page also to be sure it reaches you.

thanks once again and looking forward to sharing my book with all, -- [[User:Dineshjk|Dineshjk]] 14:47, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

: Any user could download the pdf if you uploaded it. In order to legally distribute it, however, you would need to own the copyrights, or have the permission from any others who own the copyrights, and then license it under an appropriate copyright license such as the [[w:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]]. Then, however, it would only be a pdf. It would be ideal if the text were in wiki text which anyone could edit and add upon. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

::To note that one of the problems with a PDF file is the clause about &quot;opaque&quot; file formats, of which most PDF files fit in that definition.  Here on Wikibooks, the &quot;non-opaque&quot; data is clearly in the Wiki markup text, where we are merely providing a convienent transformation of that data to something like a PDF file to help redistribute this content to places where reading web pages wouldn't necessarily be the only way to access the content.  Uploading a PDF file and including it as a traditional Wikibook would require this to be reversed, where the &quot;non-opaque&quot; data would have to somehow be made available.

::Having the content available as a TeX markup would certainly simplify the process, and a subset of TeX is included on Wikibooks for at least the formulas themselves.  But it would require either some tremendous hand editing or somebody automating the process of converting the content.  Considering that TeX is explicitly designed for printed page formating and HTML is more for hyperlinked networked &quot;virtual&quot; documents, there are some areas that would be harder to translate, if they could be done at all.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Antarados_sarkophagus_face.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A Phoenician Sculpture]]
About 800 BC, the '''Phoenicians''' lived on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean.  Their major cities were Tyre and Byblos, and they were merchants and sailors.  They traveled all over the Mediterranean and Black Seas, establishing trading outposts and cities that bought goods and raw materials from local people, and sold luxuries like ivory and purple cloth.  The purple cloth was their greatest luxury — no one else in the world knew the secret of making purple dye, and kings alone could wear the color because the Phoenicians made it so expensive. This was the origin of their name - &quot;phoenix&quot; in Greek means scarlet or dark red and was named after the famous dyes. The Phoenicians themselves had no real name, and because their writings are not common the Greek name has stuck.

==What country did they live in?==
[[Image:Phoenicia_map-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|A Map of Phoenicia with major cities marked]]
Ancient Phoenicia had its heartland in modern-day Lebanon and Syria.

Their most famous cities were Tyre, Byblos, Sarpeta, and Sidon.  The Phoenicians called themselves the Canaani, but the name we know them by, the Phoenicians, is actually what the Greeks called them.  It means &quot;purple people&quot; because of the purple dye and purple cloth which only they could provide.  The Phoenicians also established trading colonies across the Mediterranean: Tunis in Tunisia sits on top of the ancient Phoenician city of Carthage, and Cadiz in Spain is also an ancient Phoenician city.  For a time, parts of Sicily and the Baelaeric Islands were part of Phoenician territory.


==What did their buildings look like?==
The buildings are like other middle eastern buildings - block shaped houses with small windows to keep out the heat and strong fortresses for defense.

==What did they eat/drink?==
Because the Phoenicians traded all over the Mediterranean world, they ate very well.  Their diet included olives, olive oil, wine, lamb, goat, cheese, garlic, honey, dried fish, soup, bread, watermelon, grapes, blueberries, and more.

==What did they wear?==
The Phoenicians wore many things that were purple.  The kings wore a lot of purple items because they wanted to show their high authority. They wore sandals, and loose tunic type clothing. The women wore their hair in intricately pinned to their head. Jewelry was also part of Phoenician fashion.

==What did their writing look like?==
[[Image:Louvre-Egyptien-09.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A statue inscribed with Phoenician words.]]
Phoenician writing is very similar in some ways to the Latin alphabet, because the Latin alphabet was designed, in part, from the Phoenician alphabet.  In fact, the Phoenicians are the first known people to use an alphabet. Their writing system had 22 letters, which were all consonants.  The reader had to guess at the vowels the author meant to use.  

One Phoenician city, Byblos, is thought to have been a major center for writing, because the city's name is the origin of the word &quot;book&quot;!  Many scribes or professional writers worked in Byblos, and made copies of books there on Egyptian papyrus — an important trade product.

The Phoenicians, most likely a Semitic people, spoke the Phoenician language. In addition to their many inscriptions, the Phoenicians, contrary to some reports, wrote many books that have not survived. Evangelical Preparation by Eusebius of Caesarea quotes extensively from Philo of Byblos and Sanchuniathon. Furthermore, the Phoenician Punic colonies of North Africa continued to be a source of knowledge about the Phoenicians. Saint Augustine knew at least a smattering of Punic and occasionally uses it to explain cognate words found in Hebrew. The name of his mother, Saint Monica, is said to be of Punic origin as well.

==What did they believe?==
Phoenicians had many gods and goddesses called Baal and Baalet.  (Baals) for men and (Baalet) for women. They all worshiped the same major gods,but they may have different names in different cities. The Phoenicians practiced sacrifices including human sacrifices and that gave them the reputation of being cruel. It was inspired by nature. The temples were filled with priests,singers,musicians,divers,and scribes. Many of their sacrifices in the temple were of animals and children. Two of the gods they worshiped were named Baal and Astarte as he was the chief god and his consort. The Phoenicians took worship seriously and to prevent evil they would have ceremonies of dancing.

==What is their History?==
[[Image:A naval action during the siege of Tyre by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|right|250px|thumb|''The Siege of Tyre'' by Andre Castaigne]]

The Phoenicians emerged around 1200 BC, when many other empires were being attacked by barbarians. They were able to become successful during the 400 years of &quot;dark age&quot; that followed. Instead of creating an empire of land, these traders formed many trade links from a few independent cities on the coast of what is now Lebanon. They originally only traded with Egypt and Palestine because the Minoan people controlled the trade with Greece. However, once the Minoans were destroyed in the disaster of 1200 BC, the Phoenicians were able to expand their trade. Because the Phoenician homeland was in the centre of the Ancient world, they could trade with Egypt, Greece and the Middle East. By 900 BC, when the Dark Age had ended, the Phoenicians were very rich. This made them targets especially by the Assyrian people. As they were attacked, they gradually established more colonies to the West, away from the plundering Assyrians. The most powerful of these colonies became Carthage and an empire in its own right once the Phoenician cities fell in this period. From then on, they were never as independent, being owned by Assyrians, Babylonians and Persians until Alexander the Great conquered them in 332 BC ending their independence forever.

==What is left of them today?==
[[Image:Phoenician alphabet.svg|right|250px|thumb|The early Phoenician Alphabet which was later adapted by the Greeks]]

Their most significant contribution was the alphabet. It was the first original alphabet which the Greeks borrowed and changed and became similar to the one we use today. They are respected as great sailors and may have even discovered Britain and sailed around the African continent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Mongols are an ethnic group that originated in what is now Mongolia, Russia, and China. Mongols descended from the Huns, which was also the origin of the Turks. Mongolian originated ethnic groups are Hazaras in Afghanistan and minorities in Europe.

According to Chinese historical records, Mongols descended from the single lineage of Xianbei, who was defeated by Xiongnu. However, Mongols are a different ethnic group from the Chinese.

They lived on the continent of Asia but they didn’t live in one spot. They were nomadic people that traded with the Chinese and Persians. They would set up tents when they stopped in an area. The tents were made out of felt,  cone shaped, and  called steppes.

==What Countries Did They Live In? ==
Many, including Mongolia, China, Japan, Iran and Russia.

By 1279 the Mongol Empire had expanded to its farthest point going from Moscow, Russia to the South China Sea.

By 1294 the Mongol Empire had broken into four separate khanates or regions, each ruled by their own khan. To the north west was the Golden Horde, to the south west was the ll-khanate,in the center was Chagatai Khanate, to the east was the Yuan Dynasty or Great Khanate.

== What did their buildings look like? ==
[[Image:Gorskii_04412u.jpg|thumb|250px|A young woman standing in front of a yurt.]]
Mongolians lived in dwellings called yurts, which are round and had a collapsible wooden frame covered in felt made from sheep's wool, somewhat like tepees used by North American Indians. Yurts had to be portable easy to take down or put up because Mongols were a nomadic people, meaning that they had to move around often to find crops for their animals. The most important Mongols, like the khan and his top generals, had larger yurts than the other Mongols, often with decorated fabrics and even wheels. 

In the later years of the Mongol Empire, when the conquests of new territories had slowed down, the Mongols began building permanent cities and towns for the first time. The most famous city was Karakorum on the Orkhon River, which was famous for having religious builidings for all major faiths and for its magnificent palaces.

== What did they eat? ==
[[Image:MongolianStew01.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Mongolian stew with boiled meat.]]
During the Mongolian Empire there were two different groups of food, “white foods” and “red foods”. “White foods” were usually dairy products and were the main food source during the summer. The main dairy product that Mongols lived on during the summer was “Koumiss” or fermented mare’s milk which is still widely drunk today. The Mongolians rarely drank milk fresh but often used it to create other foods, including cheese and yoghurt. “Red foods” were usually meat and were the main food source during the winter. Any time meat was served in the Empire it was usually boiled and served with wild garlic or onions.

== What did they wear? ==

The boys and girls wore the same clothes, a del. This is like a dress that they wrap around themselves. Boys' dels are shorter than girls'. They sewed fur in their clothes to keep them warm. 

They wore leather boots. They also wore hats and head-dresses all year round. Some were made of sable and others were made of silver fox for cold weather and in the summertime the hats were made of colorful fabrics. They made hats for special occasions too. They love hats. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mongols.mrdonnprg/dailylife.html|title=Daily Life of Mongols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What did their writing look like? ==
[[Image:Gaykhatu_coin_with_Khagan's_name.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Coins with ancient Mongolian writing.]]
Mongolian writing was based on the older Uyghur script, which was used by the Uyghur Empire which controlled Mongolia during the 8th and 9th Centuries. It is written vertically from top to bottom, left to right. Mongolian script was first used by Uyghur scribes under Genghis Khan around the year 1204. In China, the Mongols tried to copy the Chinese emperors who had ruled before them, and began writing in Chinese, using the Chinese characters. Mongolian script is still used to write Mongolian today in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, but not in the country of Mongolia today, where it was replaced by a Cyrillic alphabet similar to Russian.

== What did they believe? ==
The earlier Mongol tribes mostly followed a type of religion known as Shamanism, where a shaman is a person who is believed to be able to contact and speak to the spirit world. One religion like this was Tengriism, which believes in multiple gods, the chief of which is Tengri, the Sky-Father. Some of the other tribes followed Manichaeism, a religion which used to be followed by the Uyghur Empire from the 8th and 9th Centuries.

As the Mongol Empire grew, it encountered many more religions - in China, the Mongols encountered Buddhism and Taoism, while they learnt about Islam when they invaded modern-day Iran and Afghanistan. They also had a lot of contact with Christians, especially the Nestorian missionaries who often travelled far into the east. The Mongol khans originally followed Tengriism, but they were very tolerant of other religions and were often eager to learn about other faiths. After the Mongol Empire broke up into smaller khanates, the local khans began converting to other religions such as Islam or Buddhism.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==

[[Image:Genghis_Khan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Genghis Khan was the first ruler of the Mongol Empire.]]

'''Genghis Khan''' and '''Kublai Khan''', the first and last rulers of the Mongol Empire are known worldwide. Genghis Khan united the arguing Mongol tribes under one banner, calling himself the ''khagan'' meaning &quot;khan of khans&quot;, and set about conquering new lands for their people. The Mongols had lived on the ''steppes'', the barren infertile mountains of Mongolia and northern China for many years. They grazed animals for food and generally lived a nomadic life.

Genghis Khan rallied the troops into a formidable army, made up of mostly highly skilled horse archers who devastated the kingdoms of the Chinese and Persians. Khan was known for his cruelty, when in one Persian city, he killed every man, woman and child and had their skulls piled up into a great pyramid to warn others not to resist him. Khan's campaign stretched across the vast wastes of Asia, into China, and deep into the Persian empire, ending up (when succeeded by his son) at what is now modern Hungary. Thankfully for the Europeans, they were spared the Mongol invasion when the army disintegrated and the unified army began fighting amongst itself.

Kublai Khan was Genghis Khan's grandson, and he admired the Chinese so strongly that he changed some of the Mongol customs to appear more Chinese. He became famous in Europe after the Italian explorer Marco Polo travelled to Mongolia to meet him and wrote a famous book about his adventures in Mongolia.

== What is left of them today? ==
The Mongolians currently number about 8.5 million and speak the Mongol language. There are approximately 2.7 million Mongols in Mongolia, 5 million Mongols living in Inner Mongolia which is in China, and 1 million Mongols live in Russia. Ethnic subgroups of Mongols are: Khalkhas, Daurs, Buryats, Evenks, Dorbots, Kalmyks, Oirats, Kazakhs, Chakhars, Tumeds, Ordoses, Bayad, Dariganga, Urianhai, Uzemchin and Zakhchin.

== When did their civilization exist? ==
The Mongol Empire lasted from 1206, when Genghis Khan united the warring Mongol tribes and was named khagan, to 1368, when the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty was overthrown by the Chinese-led Ming dynasty. After the Yuan Dynasty fell, the old Mongol Empire broke up into smaller khanates each with their own khan, which gradually became less Mongol and more like the local people instead. The Mongols who stayed in Mongolia, however, carried on in almost the same way they had lived when the Mongol Empire started.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Presbyterianism is a form of Protestant Christianity, primarily in the Reformed branch of Christendom, as well as a particular form of church government. Its primary tenets include the Five solas: Scripture alone, faith alone, Christ alone, grace alone, glory to God alone. It is practised by many (although not all) of those Protestant churches which historically subscribed to the teachings of John Calvin (known as Reformed churches). Presbyterianism traces its institutional roots back to the Scottish Reformation, especially as led by John Knox. There are many separate Presbyterian Churches in different nations around the world. Besides national distinctions, Presbyterians also have divided from one another for doctrinal reasons, especially in the wake of the Enlightenment. Theologically, presbyterianism has a high emphasis on the sovereignty of God in all things, including human salvation, a high regard for the authority of Scripture, and an emphasis on the necessity of personal conversion by grace through faith in Christ Jesus alone.

These denominations derive their name from the Greek word presbyteros (πρεσβύτερος), which means &quot;elder.&quot; Presbyterian church governance is common to the Protestant churches that were most closely modelled after the Reformation in Switzerland. In England, Scotland and Ireland, the Reformed churches that adopted a Presbyterian instead of Episcopalian government became known, naturally enough, as the Presbyterian Church.

John Knox (1505-1572), a Scot who had spent time studying under Calvin in Geneva, returned to Scotland and led the Parliament of Scotland to embrace the Reformation in 1560. The Church of Scotland was eventually reformed along Presbyterian lines. In Ireland the Presbyterian Church was formed from the Church of Scotland and later became the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. In England, Presbyterianism was established in secret in 1572, toward the end of the reign of Elizabeth I of England. In 1647, by an act of the Long Parliament under the control of Puritans, the Church of England embraced Presbyterianism. The re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660 brought the return of Episcopalian church government in England (and in Scotland for a short time); but the Presbyterian church in England continued in non-conformity, outside of the established church. However, by the 19th century most English Presbyterian congregations had become Unitarian in doctrine.

In Ireland, Presbyterianism was introduced by Scottish immigrants and missionaries to Ulster. The Presbytery of Ulster was formed separately from the established church, in 1642. Presbyterians, along with Roman Catholics in Ulster and the rest of Ireland, suffered under the discriminatory Penal Laws until they were revoked in the early 19th century. All three, very diverse branches of Presbyterianism, as well as independents, and some Dutch, German, and French Reformed denominations, combined in America to form what would eventually become the Presbyterian Church USA (1706).Presbyterians believe that they are a relationship with god, not a religion.

In England, a number of new Presbyterian Churches were founded by Scottish immigrants in the 19th century. Those linked to the Church of Scotland eventually joined the Presbyterian Church of England. Although the United Free Church of Scotland united with the Church of Scotland in 1929, the English churches linked with that denomination did not join the English denomination, which is why there are Churches of Scotland in England such as those at Crown Court (Covent Garden), and Pont Street (Knightsbridge) in London. In 1972, the Presbyterian Church of England (PCofE) united with the Congregational Church in England and Wales to form the United Reformed Church (URC). Among the congregations the PCofE brought to the URC were Tunley (Lancashire) and Aston Tirrold (Oxfordshire) - these are the sole survivors today of the English Presbyterian churches of the 17th century.

In recent years a number of smaller denominations adopting Presbyterian forms of Church Government have organised in England, including the International Presbyterian Church planted by Francis Schaeffer of L'Abri Fellowship in the 1970s, and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales was started in the North of England in the late 1980s.

In Wales Presbyterianism is represented by the Presbyterian Church of Wales.

In Canada the Presbyterian Church in Canada was the largest Protestant denomination prior to 1925 when it merged with the Methodist Church (the second largest denomination) and the Congregational Church to form the United Church of Canada; a sizeable minority of Presbyterians, primarily in southern Ontario, withdrew from the institutional Presbyterian Church in Canada to reconstitute themselves as a non-concurring continuing Presbyterian body.

Because of an emphasis on equal education for all people, Presbyterians have established and encouraged schools across the US as the country grew and the missionaries were sent out to the people.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose==

'''Mapkeys''' are macros that allow multiple Pro/Engineer commands to be executed in series by issuing a single short command.  Mapkeys thereby make the user interface customizable and can offer productivity enhancements to users.  If there is a series of commands you use frequently, or even a single function you would like to map to a keyboard command for faster access, Mapkeys offer a quick solution.  

==Creating Mapkeys==

Start by choosing Tools &gt; Mapkeys from the main menu.  The Mapkeys dialog appears.  The dialog shows a list of existing mapkeys:

[[Image:Mapkeys.png]]

Press '''New...''' and the '''Record Mapkey''' dialog appears:

[[Image:Mapkeys_record.png]]

The ''Key Sequence'' must be a series of characters from the list below.  To use a function key, lead its name with a dollar sign, e.g. $F1.  Otherwise, enter a series of visible characters (see list below).  Optionally, enter a name for the mapkey—this will show in the main table of mapkeys and can serve as a reminder of the function of the key.  A more verbose comment can be left in the Description field, which is also optional.  

At this time, the function of the command must be specified.  It can either be a recording of a series of clicks and keypresses, or it can be entered as a script.  A rudimentary text editor is offered for scripting in the OS Script tab.  Otherwise, to create a basic recorded mapkey, press Record and begin.  press Stop when the desired commands have been recorded.  Note that every detail of your actions is recorded.  Recordings may be stopped and resumed for convenience.  

Note that many commands are not available at all times.  For example, the sketcher tools are not available in the main part view mode.  Also, a number of possible clicks may be out of reach due to hidden toolbars, dialogs, or other GUI features.  

Through this interface, the keys that invoke existing recordings cannot be modified.  However, they can be changed by saving to a Configure file (the default file is called config.pro).  On the other hand, the recording or script connected with a particular key sequence can be replaced at any time.

Once the mapkey is created, click OK, and Close the Mapkeys dialog.  To use the mapkey, simply press the key sequence.

==Details==

Mapkeys are not necessarily single keys, as the name suggests, but in fact are generally commands of multiple characters, and can can be up to 77-character-long strings consisting of all the visible typed characters.  

 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
 1234567890`-=~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+[]\{}|;':&quot;,./&lt;&gt;? 

Spaces, tabs, and newlines cannot be used.  There is no distinction made for numpad keys, and the keys cannot be extended by '''Ctrl''', '''Alt''', '''Shift''', or other meta combinations.  This makes the above alphabetic characters case-insensitive. 

Alternatively, Mapkeys may be invoked by the function keys '''F1-F12'''.  In this case, they must be single keypresses; the function keys cannot be combined with other letters, numbers, or symbols.  These are specified by leading the desired function key with a dollar sign, e.g. $F5

Mapkeys commands are always typed on the keyboard and are executed immediately upon pressing the final character of the command.  Visual feedback of entered keys (other than the function keys) is shown in the lower left status bar until the command is complete.  Mapkeys are not executed until their entire command strings are typed completely, and as of Pro/Engineer Wildfire 2, there is no automatic completion mechanism available.  If a Mapkeys command is typed incorrectly, such that a nonexistent command has been entered, Pro/Engineer does not offer any warning.  In this case it is up to the user to notice that the typed characters remain in the status bar.  If excess characters remain in the Mapkeys status bar after typing a command incorrectly, they must be manually cleared by pressing '''Enter''' or by taking focus away from the Pro/Engineer window before Mapkeys may be used again.  For these reasons, Mapkeys commands are best kept as short as possible.  Users should be cautious about pressing spacebar while using Pro/Engineer because, although spaces are not allowed to be part of a Mapkeys command, this is only enforced in the creation dialog.  Spaces are allowed to be typed during regular program use.  If a space leads the front of a command, it will keep it from working. The user may waste time not noticing the invisible space causing the failure.

There is a bug in Pro/Engineer that if the 77 characters have been filled, '''Enter''' does not clear them.  Press '''Backspace''' to erase one character first.

==Q&amp;A==

===Question:===

In previous versions of Pro/E, we had mapkeys for easy change of some parameters (like Description). I can't get it to work with the new UI for parameters and relations. If I put the config options '''new_relation_ui''' and '''new_parameter_ui''' to ''no'', my mapkeys work fine. I have tried to record them from start, but with no success.

===Answer:===

When you record your macro, the first thing you do is to set the config.pro options '''new_relation_ui''' and '''new_parameter_ui''' to ''no''.  Record the rest of your macro/mapkey normally, then when finished, reset the same config.pro options back to ''yes''.

An alternative to this would be to record a macro/mapkey to set the options to ''no'' and another mapkey to set them to ''yes''.  Since mapkeys can be nested, your macro could execute the ''no'' mapkey at the beginning of your routine and then execute the ''yes'' mapkey at the end.  For example:

 mapkey q @MAPKEY_LABELNEW PARAM;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Select `main_dlg_cur` `MenuBar1`1 `Utilities`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Close `main_dlg_cur` `MenuBar1`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Activate `main_dlg_cur` `Utilities.psh_util_pref`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ FocusOut `preferences` `InputOpt`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Select `preferences` `AssyTree`1 `node0:new_parameter_ui : no : 3`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Open `preferences` `EditPanel`;~ Close `preferences` `EditPanel`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Select `preferences` `EditPanel`1 `yes *`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Activate `preferences` `AddOpt`;~ FocusOut `preferences` `InputOpt`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Activate `preferences` `ApplySave`;~ FocusOut `preferences` `InputOpt`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Activate `preferences` `Close`;
 mapkey w @MAPKEY_LABELOLD PARAM;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Select `main_dlg_cur` `MenuBar1`1 `Utilities`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Close `main_dlg_cur` `MenuBar1`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Activate `main_dlg_cur` `Utilities.psh_util_pref`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ FocusOut `preferences` `InputOpt`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Select `preferences` `AssyTree`1 `node0:new_parameter_ui : yes : 3`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Open `preferences` `EditPanel`;~ Close `preferences` `EditPanel`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ Select `preferences` `EditPanel`1 `no`;~ Activate `preferences` `AddOpt`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ FocusOut `preferences` `InputOpt`;~ Activate `preferences` `ApplySave`;\
 mapkey(continued) ~ FocusOut `preferences` `InputOpt`;~ Activate `preferences` `Close`;

===Question:===

How do you make nested mapkeys?

What would @dp04 mean for a &quot;key sequence?

===Answer:===

To nest mapkeys (call a mapkey from another mapkey), add % into the top level mapkey.

For example, here is a mapkey named ''print'' that calls two mapkeys named ''zr'' and ''laser''.

 mapkey print @MAPKEY_NAMEPrint Extents;%zr;%laser;

==Purpose==
Adds a nifty info bar across the top of userpages (or talk pages if used there).

==Usage==
&lt;pre&gt;{{userinfo

By default this template displays a link to [[User:Interiot|Interiot]]'s edit count. You can add a &quot;purge server cache&quot; link by passing &lt;code&gt;purge = yes&lt;/code&gt; (any other value for &lt;code&gt;purge&lt;/code&gt; is ignored, and &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; is case sensetive).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Tiber River ==

Rome sat on the eastern shore of the Tiber River, at the only easy crossing place between the river mouth and the mountains.   Seven hills rose there out of low and marshy ground.  By the beginning of the ninth century BCE, these seven hills were occupied by village communities who kept farms in the low-lying areas and retreated to their hilltops for defense.

The fording place on the river lay below a large island that was later dedicated to the Greek god of healing, Asclepius.  Sometime in the sixth century BCE, the Romans under the direction of their Etruscan kings built a wooden bridge over the Tiber at this point, facilitating communications between northern and southern Italy, and joining the Etrurian confederation to the Greek colonial cities in the district of Magna Graecia.

== The Seven Hills ==

Archaeology suggests that Rome began as a confederation of villages on the seven hills of Rome: the Capitoline, Palatine, Aventine, Viminal, Quirinal, Esquiline, and the Caelian.   The low-lying ground between them was swampy and malarial.  Yet the presence of a natural fording place gave Rome some unusual advantages.  Once the seven villages united, and invested the time in constructing an early wall around their territory, they could charge a toll for the use of the ford (and later the bridge).  This was to prove an early source of Rome's wealth.  Graves dating from the ninth and eighth centuries BCE suggest two common forms of burial in the area:  cremation graves are clustered in Rome's Forum or marketplace, with a smattering of inhumations around them; a much larger cemetery lay in the valley between the Esquiline and Viminal hills.

Tradition and myth provides a much more interesting, if less likely, story of Rome's founding.  One of the [[Wikipedia:Vestal Virgins|Vestal Virgins]] of the nearby town of [[Wikipedia:Alba Longa|Alba Longa]] had a sexual encounter with the god Mars, and bore Romulus and Remus, twin sons who catalyzed the fortification of a small urban area in what is now Rome.  
=== Capitoline ===
Capitoline hill has deep roots in Roman history as its existence is acknowledged in the stories concerning the founding of Rome.

=== Palatine ===

=== Aventine ===

== The Forum ==

      <comment>Macedonian numbers in English by Lavanya Ch</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The numbers in the macedonian language form one to ten are:

1 - еден   - Eden&lt;br&gt; 
2 - два    - Dva&lt;br&gt;
3 - три    - Tri&lt;br&gt;
4 - четири - Chetiri&lt;br&gt;
5 - пет    - Pet&lt;br&gt;
6 - шест   - Shest&lt;br&gt;
7 - седум  - Sedum&lt;br&gt;
8 - осум   - Osum&lt;br&gt;
9 - девет  - Devet&lt;br&gt;
10 - десет - Deset&lt;br&gt;

Folowed by:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
11 - единаесет    - Edinaeset&lt;br&gt;
12 - дванаесет    - Dvanaeset&lt;br&gt;
13 - тринаесет    - Trinaeset&lt;br&gt;
14 - четиринаесет - Chetirinaeset&lt;br&gt;
15 - петнаесет    - Petnaeset&lt;br&gt;
16 - шеснаесет    - Shesnaeset&lt;br&gt;
17 - седумнаесет  - Sedumnaeset&lt;br&gt;
18 - осумнаесет   - Osumnaeset&lt;br&gt;
19 - деветнаесет  - Devetnaeset&lt;br&gt;
20 - дваесет      - Dvaeset&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To form the numbers after twenty you should use the following formula: дваесет + и (which means ''and'' in macedonian ) + the number you want to add e.g. five&lt;br&gt;
That would be:
дваесет+и+пет which correctly written and read will be&lt;br&gt;
дваесет и пет&lt;br&gt;
This formula is used to form the rest of the numbers:&lt;br&gt;

30 - триесет    - Trieset&lt;br&gt;
40 - четириесет - Chetirieset&lt;br&gt;
50 - педесет    - Pedeset&lt;br&gt;
60 - шеесет     - Sheeset&lt;br&gt;
70 - седумдесет - Sedumdeset&lt;br&gt;
80 - осумдесет  - Osumdeset&lt;br&gt;
90 - деведесет  - Devedeset&lt;br&gt;

And then:&lt;br&gt;
100 - сто - Sto&lt;br&gt;
1 000 - илјада - Ilyada&lt;br&gt;
1 000 000 - милион - Milion&lt;br&gt;
1 000 000 000 - милијарда - Miliyarda&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Shakespeare's works==

I'm afraid that Wikibooks is for textbooks, and therefore I have had to delete the Shakespeare's works book. Content such as this is more appropriate for our sister project Wikisource, which hosts public domain and GFDL-licensed material. I'd imagine they already have Shakespeare on there though. If you're interested in writing a textbook on Shakespeare's plays, however, this would be suitable for Wikibooks, and would be most welcome here, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:19, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks for your message. You will see that as I deleted the Wikisource-type content, you will have a fresh start. Do look at [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts bookshelf]] for similar tomes - and do consider whether it's best to have one book per play and then merge them later, or to set out to have a book of everything straightaway. Often starting small and growing bigger is best - (1) presentationally, and (2) because it takes so long to write a book - if you only write about 3 plays, say, then leave the project, it's better to leave 3 complete textbooks than one textbook 21/24ths (or whatever) incomplete. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:26, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

Oh sorry - I hadn't realised what went would be useful for you. I'll recreate it so you can tweak it to Wikibooks' requirements, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:28, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

:I have now restored all the pages, except for [[:Image:Shakespeare.jpg]] (as images, when deleted, get permanently deleted from the database). Hopefully it won't be too much trouble for you to locate this - although you'd be better off either choosing an image already on Commons, or alternatively uploading your image to Commons and linking through to here.

:Good luck with your textbook. I hope you do get through all the plays - though it will take some time. It would still be a good idea to complete each play in turn before moving onto another one - and also, once you have a good start, you may be more successful in encourgaging others to collaborate with you. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:35, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

I appreciate that it's difficult to learn some of our ways. We do have a [[Help]] section, but as you will see from the Main Page, it is currently the collaboration of the month to improve it because it doesn't work. Hopefully some of what is there can help you - alternatively, look at some of our best books (these are the hot picks and the ones with cups by them on the Main Page) and copy the style they adopt. Do click &quot;edit this page&quot; on them to check the mark-up, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:55, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

:Tables of contents appear when you have at least three headers to put in them, unless you add &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOTOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page - I demonstrate below. I'm not sure, but &lt;nowiki&gt;__TOC__&lt;/nowiki&gt; may force a table of contents to appear with fewer headers, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:31, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

==This is header one==

===This is a sub-header===

====And you can have any level of sub-headers you wish====

==This is header two==

==This is header three==

== New info ==

There was already an existing book (or rather start of book) called ''Introduction to Shakespeare'', which I am merging into your book. Please feel free to amend, move or delete the text so that it fits in fully with your book.

Also, are you going to annotate each play in detail? If not, then really you should be linking to the plays on Wikisource rather than adding an unannotated text to Wikibooks. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:38, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

== Book of the month ==

Hi, Brandon. I've removed [[Wikiversity:School of Mathematics]] from the book of the month voting because it is a Wikiversity school and not a Wikibooks book. Wikiversity is a separate project and will soon be moved to its own wiki, so I think it's best to not intertwine the two so much. If the school won, we would have to link to a separate wiki if Wikiversity is split of next month! Good luck on the William Shakespeare project. Cheers! --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 23:33, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

I made a few changes on the aforementioned book.  Let me know what you think. [[User:ABurke|ABurke]] 02:40, 20 September 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why this Wikibook?==
The basic point of this Wikibook is to allow anyone surfing the web to be able to use a reliable text about Shakespeare's works (his plays and poems). Also, along with every play, there is a brief explanation of its origins, plot, and themes. Perfect for homework use! Alongside some of the plays, there is a plot summary, either act-by-act or scene-by-scene. Be sure to make the most use out of this marvelous collection on facts on Shakespeare's works, along with the works themselves.

==Original Plays==
The original plays of Shakespeare can be found [[s:Author:William_Shakespeare|here]].  They are not available at Wikibooks because Wikisource is a better location for original texts.  When you have read the play you can return by clicking &quot;back&quot; on your browser.

==How to Edit==
If a Renaissance word is found that has a better Contemporary English replacement, put that word in italic parentheses. For example...&lt;br&gt;
almanack ''(almanac)''&lt;br&gt;
That way, the reader can distinguish the original Shakespearian word from a better modern English replacement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you are adding a play, please use a table for putting the play in. Look at &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; for an example (Click on edit this page). '''Don't forget to put in a section on the basis of the play, including: when and why it was written, a brief summary, and the main themes of the plays, if applicable.'''&lt;br&gt;
'''THANK YOU!'''

====About this Play====
This play was written between 1595 and 1596. This is one of his early wedding comedies, and was written to accompany a marriage celebration. Unlike most of Shakespeare's other works, there is very little borrowing from other works. (For example, &lt;i&gt;Romeo and Juliet&lt;/i&gt; is based on &lt;i&gt;The Tragedie of Romeus and Juliet&lt;/i&gt;.) Most scholars agree that Shakespeare enjoyed writing this play more than any other one.

The play's main plot circles around two couples: Hermia and Lysander, and Helena and Demetrius. Their problems become greater as they enter the fairyland woods, and as the monarchs of the fairies, King Oberon and Queen Titania, mess up the relationships.

This play emphasizes themes of love, dreams, imagination, and the power of a patriarchal society.

=The Comedies of Shakespeare=

Shakespeare covered a wide range of themes and characters in his comedies. Three comedies that were performed and published in 1594, towards the end of the first period, will show this neatly.

For example, in [[s:A Midsummer Night's Dream|A Midsummer Night's Dream]], he covered marriage in Fairyland, with well-known characters such as Titania and Oberon (the king and queen of Fairyland), and more purely comic characters such as Bottom. The scenery is often very lavish for this play, and many performances take place outdoors.

In [[s:The Taming of the Shrew|The Taming of the Shrew]], another play about marriage and love, Katherine is the headstrong daughter of a king, until she meets her match in Petruchio.

[[s:The Merchant of Venice|The Merchant of Venice]] is all about the lives of Venetian merchants.

[[s:Twelfth Night, or What You Will|Twelfth Night]] was commissioned for James I and played when Shakespeare was a member of the King's Men, or about that time. It is a play about the English tradition of Epiphany, which is on January 6.

==About this Play==
''The Comedy of Errors'' is Shakespeare's shortest play and possibly his first comedy, written circa 1589 to 1594. The play is based on two Roman comedies: Plautus' ''Manaechmi'' and ''Amphitruo,'' both of which have the plot with &quot;errors&quot; of mistaken identities.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;Br&gt;
In this play, Aegeon is separated from his wife and one of his twin sons. In this play, Shakespeare took the flat characters of Plautus' stories and made them dynamic. For example, Adriana, along with other female characters, has more voice in this play than any other Shakespeare wrote. Shakespeare also added one extra set of twins.&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The main theme of this play is of identity problems.  It begs the question of what constitutes identity and how one can be known; that is, are you known by your name, your visual appearance, or your actions?  Or a combination of all three?

==Dramatis Personæ==
*Solinus
*Ægeon
*Æmilia
*Antipholus of Syracuse + Antipholus of Ephesus (twin brothers)
*Dromeus of Syracuse + Dromeus of Ephesus (twin brothers; attendants of both Antipholuses)
*Adriana

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Gaitas.jpg|thumb|left|Diatonic Harmonicas.  Image:Cralize]]

The harmonica is an instrument that has found favour with many guitarist. The idea evolved from the blues and country and western musicians of the early part of the 20th century. The role the harmonica plays in providing another timbre has appealed to many artists. Musicians such as Bob Dylan and Neil Young have used the combination to great effect. 

Harmonicas exist in four varieties: diatonic, chromatic, tremolo and chord. The chromatic can play along to music in any key but is harder to master than the diatonic version. The diatonic harmonica is made to play in one key and is easier to learn but you will need to buy more than one. The guitar's natural key is E; so buying a diatonic harmonica in the key of E major would be ideal. The other diatonic harmonicas you should aim to add to your collection is G major and C major. Diatonic harmonicas are cheap and it shouldn't take long before you have a collection of harmonicas that cover every key. The tremolo harmonica is like a diatonic, yet it vibrates and has more vibrato than usual harmonicas. It is used for orchestra too.Chord harmonicas are very big and may require multiple people to play and can be even used in the orchestra at times.They add a touch to a lot of things really.Chord Harmonicas are very cool,yet very expensive too and they can run in the thousands when it comes to cost.Some good Chord Harmonicas can cost you $2,000 or more depending on the company selling them.

[[Image:16-hole chrom 10-hole diatonic.jpg|thumb|right|Chromatic harmonica and Diatonic harmonica.
        Image:George Leung]] 

To play both instruments, one would need a way to hold the harmonica while the hands chord and strum the guitar. This is done by the harmonica holder, which goes around the neck, allowing the harmonica to be always in front of your mouth. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

*Instead of moving the harmonica itself, you will now move your head in order to play the notes. Due to this limitation the solos you &quot;blow&quot; will be slower than if you had the harmonica cupped in your hands.
*Hand-related effects, such as hand vibrato, will be unavailable. Also, due to the lack of hands, there will be no additional resonance from the cupped hands.

Furthermore, since one is multitasking, it's best to know how to play both instruments individually very well, in order to spend less time trying to find each note and chord. When you buy your first harmonica, spend some time learning to play it with your hands. Try playing along to the recordings of Little Walter and Sonny Boy Williamson.  

The harmonica will usually be played in the 2nd position (of course one can try other positions). Often the guitar plays the chords, while the harmonica provides the melody. This is because guitars have a much lower octave range than the harmonica; furthermore, guitarists can play chords in different keys easily. Since the harmonica is played in a higher pitch range, this makes it suitable for melodic lines. Another factor is the timbre of the harmonica tends to cut through the sound of resonating guitar chords. Still, this should not stop you reversing the roles, as long as it sounds pleasing.

It is possible to play chromatic harmonicas with a guitar. This can be done with the following:
*Valved Diatonic or XB-40
*Tombo S-50. 
*Take off the mouthpiece of a '''straight tuned''' chromatic harp. However, one may need to make sure the body's edge is smooth
::Note: both S-50 and this method require using the lips to block the non-sounding row; S-50, due to greater distance between rows, is easier at this.
*Use the handless chromatic; essentially a special mouthpiece that move up and down between the rows, controlled by the movement of the head.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{:The Universe Made Simple/Navigation|2}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

You're reading this book because you want to know more about the universe that you live in. But what is the universe?

==What is the universe?==

The universe is everything that there is. Some people like to think of the universe as a vast container, in which everything that exists resides. However, no one knows whether or not this container is infinite in size, or if it has an &quot;outer limit.&quot; No one knows for sure, as this question of &quot;Is the universe finite or infinite?&quot;, has been asked for ages. Many scientists speculate that it expands outward as a balloon and has no end, continuing forever in all directions without any meaning at all. Still, some believe there is a limit and that all the galaxies and stellar objects are contained within a limited universe. This moves out of the realm of science and into the realm of metaphysics and philosophy, because there is no empirical data to suggest any conclusion as of yet.

When you look at the night sky, and see the stars, you are looking out into a very close part of the universe. The stars you see are such an incredible distance away that it makes you stand awestruck by it all. The blackness you see is the empty space of the universe; the parts that are not filled with light. However, there may be objects moving in the blackness that have no light shining on them, and we can only wonder what else is moving through space.

==How did people discover all this?==

We're constantly hearing about research, and how some scientist here has discovered some new thing. But how is it actually all done? The answer is that in many cases it is extremely complicated, and that the method changes depending upon what you want to find out, and what you're looking at. Sometimes scientists build huge, special devices just to help them inspect something.

We discover things about the universe, however, by simply looking at it. We use huge telescopes that can see millions and millions of miles away. We have sent special robots called probes out into space to go and take pictures of distant things, and transmit the pictures back to Earth. We've even sent people in space-ships out into space. But space-travel is extremely expensive, difficult and dangerous. Most of the time, scientists work by taking observations, looking at how things move, and then using mathematics to work out what they must be like if they're moving like that or looking like that.

==What will this book teach you?==

This book aims to be simple but informative. It will try not to miss out any important information, but it will also not confuse you with intricate details or physics.

The book will be like a journey. We will begin on Earth, then set off into the Solar System, out into the Galaxy, beyond it into the further Universe, and then even further. At each stage we hope to give you an appreciation of scale, and how everything fits together.

''The Universe Made Simple'' is a book that attempts to describe the universe to someone who knows little or nothing about it to start with. It aims to explain the basic structure of the universe, our place in it, and some of its core, basic workings.

This book aims to be as simple as possible, but not at the risk of inaccuracy or dumbing-down. Some things will be omitted or phrased in looser terms. The book is not [[Wikijunior]], but it also isn't a detailed or advanced book; it is for new learners wishing for a sound grasp of the most important points.

      <text xml:space="preserve">First of all (and kind of obvious suggested by the title), &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; must be diagonalizable.  Second, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;  are found, and form the matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}&lt;/math&gt; which is an augemented matrix of eigenvectors, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}&lt;/math&gt; which is a matrix consisting of the corresponding eigenvalues on the main diagonal in the same column as their corresponding eigenvectors.  Then with our central problem:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}' = \mathbf{AX} + \mathbf{G}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

We substitute:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{TY}' = \mathbf{ATY} + \mathbf{G}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Then left multiply by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}' = \mathbf{T}^{-1}\mathbf{ATY} + \mathbf{T}^{-1}\mathbf{G}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

As a consequence of Linear Algebra we take the following identity:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{T}^{-1}\mathbf{AT}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}' = \mathbf{DY} + \mathbf{T}^{-1}\mathbf{G}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

And because of the nature of the diagonal the problem is a series of one-dimensional normal differential equations which can be solved for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}&lt;/math&gt; and used to find out &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is very similar to the Method of Undetermined Coefficients encountered in normal differential equations, with some slight exceptions to the &quot;rules&quot; of guessing.  Actually, there's only one rule extra.  In the normal method of undetermined coefficients when there was a conflict of the characteristic equation with the particular solution, there was a multiplication by the independent variable.  In this case we multiply by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}t + \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; to include more possible solutions.  That, and when working through the problem thoughts about the signifigance of getting a trivial solution when finding eigenvalues must be kept in mind.  Other than that, it's pretty much as it was, and is a very powerful method (although it can be quite tedious).

      <text xml:space="preserve">As with the variation of parameters in the normal differential equations (a lot of similarities here!) we take a fundamental solution and by using a product with a to-be-found vector, see if we can come upon another independent solution by these means.  In other words, since the general solution can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c\psi}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the constant matrix and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; is the augmented set of independent solutions to the homogeneous equation, we try out a form like so:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{u\psi}&lt;/math&gt;

And determine &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; to find a unique solution.  The math is fairly straightforward and left as an exercise for the reader, and leaves us with:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{\psi}(t) \mathbf{\psi}^{-1}(t_0) \mathbf{X}^0 + \mathbf{\psi}(t) \int_{t_0}^t \mathbf{\psi}^{-1}(s) \mathbf{g}(s) ds &lt;/math&gt;

... which is a fairly strong, striaghtforward, yet exceedingly complicated formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yet AGAIN, very similar to the normal technique.  The only nuance is how to take a Laplacian operator of a matrix, however, the Laplacian operator by definition is basically an integral:  take the operator of each term inside the matrix.  The Laplacian operator then boils the problem to an exercise of linear algebra. and the reverse Laplacian operator works the same way:  on each term in the matrix.  It's nearly identical to how it worked in normal differential equations.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

'''''Protego''''' is a spell used to guard its caster from incoming spells. It doesn't work against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Avada Kedavra|the killing curse]].  It is coined from the Latin verb 'protego', 'to protect' (lit. to cover over).

== Extended Description ==

The effects of this charm seem to vary based on the desires of the spell caster.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], we see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] using this spell against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] in his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]] lesson. Here, the effect is to reverse the spell being cast; Harry sees some of Snape's memories instead of the expected outcome, Snape seeing some of Harry's thoughts.

In the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle at the Ministry]] late in that same book, Harry uses this spell twice. Both times, the spell being cast at him is simply interrupted.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] casts this spell once, and Harry casts it three times. In these cases, the result of the spell is a &quot;bubble&quot; that is impermeable to spells and physical traversal (the bubble forming knocks Hermione back a few steps), though it is still possible to see and hear through it.

Also in the seventh book, several of the characters append this with other words. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] uses &quot;Protego Horribilis&quot;&lt;!-- DH30, UK edition p483 --&gt; when he is preparing a shield for the school, and Hermione uses &quot;Protego Totalum&quot;&lt;!-- DH14, UK edition p224 --&gt; when setting defensive spells around the campsite. The specific effects of the added words are not certain.

== Overview ==

A '''''fire-call''''' is a specialized use of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Floo Network|Floo Network]] – when you do not need to be physically present in another location, but you need to communicate with someone there, you insert just your head into a prepared fireplace, and your head is transported to another fireplace.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

This technique is first seen in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']] when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amos Diggory|Amos Diggory]], then at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], has urgent need to reach [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Arthur Weasley]] regarding some garbage cans that are flying around [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody's]] yard. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] receives a fire-call from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] later in the book. It is also used in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], twice by Sirius to reach Harry, and twice by Harry to try and reach Sirius. Harry feels that this is a very uncomfortable way to send a message; quite apart from the necessity to stay hunched over the fireplace while talking, it is very disconcerting to have your head whirled around dizzily while the remainder of your body remains firmly planted on the floor in front of the sending fireplace.

== Overview ==

'''''Transfiguration''''' is the family of magical spells that are used for changing objects from one type of thing into another. At Hogwarts, Transfiguration is taught by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor Minerva McGonagall]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Transfiguration covers a wide range of spells. At the low end of the scale, the first Transfiguration charm learned by Harry's class is changing a match into a needle; the more complex spells include changing creatures from one species to another. It also includes discussions of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]], though we don't see how to become one.

As mentioned, Transfiguration is a core course, presumably for all schools, not just Hogwarts, as we hear Professor McGonagall telling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', not to reveal that he has not yet mastered a simple Switching Spell. We note that this is the only mention of this spell, so we have no indication of how long Neville has been trying to learn it; from McGonagall's tone of exasperation, however, we believe it to be something assigned in an earlier year that Neville was still not able to perform to an acceptable level. McGonagall's concern about this perceived failure of teaching on her part would suggest strongly that Transfiguration, including Switching Spells, is taught at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]].

It is mentioned in ''The Tales of Beedle the Bard'' that Professor McGonagall had learned and carried out the Animagus transform as part of her research on Transfiguration. We also learn there that the Animagus transform allows the caster to retain human intelligence. While it is possible, theoretically, to Transfigure yourself into an animal, you would also end up with the animal's intelligence, and would be trapped in the form of that animal until some other wizard returned you to your human shape.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 26|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] uses partial transfiguration to give himself a shark's head so that he can breathe underwater. Clearly this is an exception to the rule above that prevents Transfiguring oneself into an animal. We assume that this is very advanced magic, as it would be necessary to give yourself the shark's face and gills, while keeping your brain human so that you can undo the spell afterwards.

== Analysis ==

Transfiguration is largely a practical class, and as such is relatively noisy with students casting spells, and, at times, sounds from the animals used as subjects. As such, it is one of the places where the Trio feel able to discuss events. With the potential for spells to go wrong, it is also a place where there is a certain amount of slapstick humour. The possibilities of both conferences and humour, however, are more than slightly decreased by Professor McGonagall, a stern teacher who keeps a relatively tight control on her classroom.

As mentioned in the article on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Charms|Charms]], the distinction between Charms (which change what a thing does without changing its essential nature) and Transfiguration (which changes its essential nature) is somewhat loose. In Transfiguration class, we note Ron having trouble with a Silencing charm, and there is later mention of a Vanishing charm, where it is mentioned that it is more difficult to Vanish live animals than inanimate objects. Whether Silenced or Vanished, however, the object remains intrinsically the same, a silenced bullfrog is still a bullfrog, while a vanished rat, if it can be unvanished, does not lose its essential rat nature.

In the earliest Transfiguration classes, Professor McGonagall changes her desk into a pig and back again, and we later see lessons where the students are asked to Transfigure teapots into tortoises. This does raise an awkward question: does this form of magic allow the wizard to create life? This question is never addressed in the books.

We will assume that it is a literary device only that has most transfigurations being done between things with the same first letter. We have already mentioned teapots and tortoises, and beetles and buttons; a mistake in the Transfiguration OWL exams saw one student mistakenly creating a flock of flamingos rather than a ferret. We will note, however, that in the real world, our belief in magic was based on the doctrine of signatures, that held that, as all things were created by God, a similarity of appearance implied a relationship in effect. While there is much less belief in magic in the current day, the doctrine of signatures still underlies what belief there is. So deliberate use of similarity in name does tend to enhance the apparent authenticity of magic in the series.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Some Graphical Analysis=

So far we've dealt with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; being a constant matrix, and other niceties; but when it is otherwise, and thus a non-linear differential equation, the best way to find a solution is by graphical means.  By taking the independent variables on the axis of a graph, we can note several types of behavior that suggest the form of a solution.

So without adue, here are the main types of behaviors, and their suggested causes:

A nodal source (the graph tends away from a point):  real, distinct positive eigenvalues.

A nodal sink (the graph approaches in towards a point):  real, dinstinct negative eigenvalues.

A saddle point (the graph approaches from one end and deviates away at another):  real, disntinct, opposite eigenvalues.

A spiral point (spirals in or away from a point):  a complex eignevalues.

A series of ellipses around a point:  a purely imaginary eigenvalue.

A star point (straight lines deviating or coming towards a point):  repeated eigenvalues.

== Overview ==

'''''Werewolves''''' are humans who, when exposed to the full moon, transform into savage, wolf-like creatures.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

To become a werewolf, a person must be bitten by another werewolf. When the person transforms, they lose control of themselves and are not responsible for their actions. However, there is a potion, the recently discovered [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Wolfsbane Potion|Wolfsbane Potion]], which, if taken daily in the week preceding the full moon, will cause the victim to be able to keep their mind while they transform. They are then able to control their actions, and are virtually harmless. 

One of the major characters in the Harry Potter Series, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]], is a werewolf.

[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fenrir Greyback|Fenrir Greyback]] is another werewolf who is mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. He accompanies the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Tower Battle (Hogwarts)|tower battle at Hogwarts]] at the end of that book, and attacks [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bill Weasley|Bill Weasley]] in that battle. We also see him heading up a gang of Snatchers in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], and fighting alongside the Death Eaters in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|final battle]] in that book.

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] and the Weasley family are visiting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]] at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]] after the snake attacks him in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 21|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], they ask what is wrong with a man in the ward who looks fine. Mr. Weasley quietly says that he was bitten by a werewolf, and is now upset because his life is ruined. When Mr. Weasley had mentioned that he had a friend who was a werewolf and was able to live an almost normal life, the man had threatened to bite him. During a later visit, Remus Lupin goes over to talk to him; we don't hear their conversation.

== Analysis ==

Much prejudice against werewolves is witnessed throughout the series. In the wizarding community, werewolves are distrusted and even hated. Most people refuse to associate with them. We see three ways that wizards deal with this issue. When a person is bitten by a werewolf, they often despair and deem themselves doomed to be outcast; this is how Mr. Weasley's unnamed ward-mate seems to be reacting to his ailment. Remus Lupin, conversely, does what he can to make the best of his admittedly rough situation, either locking himself up or taking a possibly expensive and distasteful potion to render himself harmless. Greyback, apparently, chooses an opposite course, reflecting the distrust that he receives from wizards back at them as hatred, and emphasizing his fear-induced separation from the Wizarding world by deliberately Transforming in areas where he can do the most damage to wizards. We are told that Lupin became a werewolf after being bitten by Greyback as a child.

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}
# If a human becomes a werewolf only when bitten by another werewolf, how did the first werewolf come into existence? 
# Can a werewolf change at will, apart from when it is exposed to the full moon? 
# When werewolves are mentioned as dangerous creatures, how would they be dangerous when not in transformed state as they transform only in exposure of the full moon?
# If [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Animagus|Animagi]] in animal form are unaffected by werewolf transformation, why isn't there mention of a werewolf becoming an Animagus to avoid this transformation?
# Could a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]] become a werewolf?
# Is it possible that werewolves are not victims of a &quot;bad curse&quot;, but a legitimate virus that is spread through contact between saliva and blood?
# Could female werewolves bear healthy children?

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

We never see a female werewolf, so the question of whether a female werewolf can bear unaffected children is not answered. However, we do know that male werewolves can father normal children; Lupin, a werewolf, marries Tonks, and they have a child together. The child, Teddy, has apparently inherited his mother's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Metamorphmagus|Metamorphmagus]] ability, but apparently is not a Werewolf.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A task is a piece of code that can be executed.

A task can have multiple attributes (or arguments, if you prefer). The value of an attribute might contain references to a property. These references will be resolved before the task is executed.

Tasks have a common structure:

&lt;name attribute1=&quot;value1&quot; attribute2=&quot;value2&quot; ... /&gt;

where name is the name of the task, attributeN is the attribute name, and valueN is the value for this attribute.

There is a set of built-in tasks, along with a number of optional tasks, but it is also very easy to write your own.

All tasks share a task name attribute. The value of this attribute will be used in the logging messages generated by Ant.

Tasks can be assigned an id attribute: 

&lt;taskname id=&quot;taskID&quot; ... /&gt;

where taskname is the name of the task, and taskID is a unique identifier for this task. You can refer to the corresponding task object in scripts or other tasks via this name. For example, in scripts you could do: 

&lt;script ... &gt;
  task1.setFoo(&quot;bar&quot;);
&lt;/script&gt;

to set the foo attribute of this particular task instance. In another task (written in Java), you can access the instance via project.getReference(&quot;task1&quot;).

Note 1: If &quot;task1&quot; has not been run yet, then it has not been configured (i.e., no attributes have been set), and if it is going to be configured later, anything you've done to the instance may be overwritten. 

Note 2: Future versions of Ant will most likely not be backward-compatible with this behaviour, since there will likely be no task instances at all, only proxies.

== Overview ==

'''''Aragog''''' is an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|Acromantula]], a rare giant spider whose venom is very useful in potions. He was raised by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]] and is very loyal to him. He regards all other humans as prey. We first see him in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 15|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

In the memory shown to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Riddle]]'s diary, we see Hagrid caring for a large, hairy creature in the dungeons. Harry guesses that the hairy creature is the monster in the Chamber, and that Hagrid had been expelled for releasing it. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and Harry are unable to query Hagrid about this, however, as he is arrested shortly after they reach his hut. As he is leaving, he tells the boys that they should &quot;follow the spiders.&quot;

The spiders lead Ron and Harry into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], where they are captured by Aragog's children and taken to Aragog. He says that he was never the monster in the Chamber, and was never near the bathroom where the girl was killed by the monster. He refuses to name the monster, apparently it is so feared by spiders that they cannot even name it. Finally, he says that he cannot stop his children from eating the &quot;friends of Hagrid&quot;. Harry and Ron are carried to safety by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley's]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ford Anglia|flying car]], largely feral and still wandering the Forest.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

At the begining of the book we learn from Hagrid that Aragog is very ill. Towards the end he dies and his funeral is a crucial event in the book. 

Driven by his greed (Acromantula venom is very expensive), [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]] allows himself to converse with Harry for an extended period in the presence of mead. Thus Harry is able to convince Slughorn to surrender his memory of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]], which is crucial to an understanding of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]'s plans.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Aragog is mentioned in passing during the last [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle at Hogwarts]] when one of his descendants bursts through a hole in the castle wall. A large number of his descendants are also mentioned as apparently carrying off Hagrid, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] is mentioned as having set up camp in the Forbidden Forest where Aragog and his family had once been.

== Strengths ==

Loyalty, and as the patriarch of the entire community apparently has some limited ability to keep his family in check.

== Weaknesses ==

Aragog seems to have a tendency to eat everything around; this may not be a weakness, but is bound to affect his relationships with non-spiders. He is afraid of certain creatures and unwilling to even name them.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Aragog reveres Hagrid as the one who reared him, found him a home and a wife, and protected him in his youth from those like Riddle who would kill him. He controls his brood basically through force of personality, but his control is fading as he ages. While he is willing to speak with &quot;friends of Hagrid&quot;, he does not believe he has the ability to protect them from his offspring.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==
{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Questions}}

== Greater Picture ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets/Chapter 15|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']] we learn that Voldemort, or as he was then known Tom Riddle, had framed Hagrid and Aragog for a murder they did not commit. In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 22|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], through Aragog's death and Hagrid's grief, Harry obtained a piece of information that is vital for the fight against Voldemort. This would seem to be another example of J.K. Rowling’s love of symmetry.

Aragog's being unwilling to name the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Basilisk|Basilisk]] might have been a clue to its nature, but this proves unnecessary; [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] had already determined the nature of the monster from the other clues, and it is only her being Petrified that has prevented her from revealing this to us. What is revealed is that the monster had killed a girl in a bathroom, and Harry puts these pieces together to come up with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Moaning Myrtle|Moaning Myrtle]], and the possibility that the entrance to the Chamber is in her bathroom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[user:Hagindaz]] has proposed that the book '''Ancient Greece''' be merged with this chapter. While I don't necessarily disagree, I would like to ask ''what purpose is served by the merger?''  Is there a need to conserve database space?  Or is the goal to reduce the number of available titles on [[Main Page|WikiBooks']] bookshelves, so that more books become completed, faster?  Is it useful that the book '''[[Ancient History]]''' have a good overview of ancient Greece, while '''Ancient Greece''' is a more thorough and detailed history?  I've been here three days, and I don't know the answers to these questions yet. [[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 11:33, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:There's really no reason to have two books with duplicate content, unless they are not mutually inclusive (such as one on ancient history, of which ancient Greece would be a part, and one on Greek history, of which ancient Greece would be a part). The Ancient Greece book has nothing in it which would merit being independent of this Wikibook, so I agree with the merger proposal.

==Shakespeare's Tragedies==

Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on a fatally flawed character or system, that is, a flaw ultimately results in death or destruction.

Scholars divide the plays into periods. A '''first-period tragedy''' (from 1590-1594) is Titus Andronicus. Shakespeare's greatest tragedies come from his '''second''' and '''third periods'''. 

[[/Romeo and Juliet/]] is an example of a second-period tragedy, as is Julius Caesar. 

In the third period, Shakespeare wrote [[/Hamlet/]], [[/Othello/]], [[/King Lear/]], [[/Macbeth/]], Antony and Cleopatra.

Titus Andronicus, about a Roman king whose daughter is raped, is full of violence and comedy.

[[/Romeo and Juliet/]] is about teenage romance and how it can be stopped by feuding families. 

Julius Caesar is an historical tragedy concerning the ethics and consequences of political assassination.

[[/Hamlet/]] is about a tortured young prince who is obliged to kill his uncle to avenge his father's death.

[[/Othello/]] is about a Moor who is deceived by the machinations of his servant Iago, and his love for Desdemona.

[[/King Lear/]] is about a king who divides his kingdom between three daughters, two of whom turn on him and the third, who truly loves him, is unrecognized. This is considered to be Shakespeare's darkest tragedy and was not performed for many years.

Antony and Cleopatra is about two great lovers and nobility is an important theme in it. So are the relations between two very different cultures: Egypt and Rome.

Macbeth, Set in Scotland, is about an ambitious Thane who murders the King in order to ascend  to the throne.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think that this is the recipe for the &quot;Margarita&quot;(tomato) sauce.


I (mcampo84) removed any mention of oregano.  Oregano is NEVER to be used in marinara sauce unless you want your pasta to taste like pizza.

I like to add 1/2 cup of finely shredded carrots to the onions and garlic and saute at the first.  When carrots saute, they release a natural sweetener which eliminates the need to add sugar and also helps to thicken the sauce.

Garlic is normally, heated in the oil and removed, this is give beautiful intensity to the sauce, without being over dominant. Canned tomato is preferred to fresh, skinned Pelati tomatoes are the typical.

== Please stop calling it &quot;marinara&quot; ==

The only people in the world who call Italian tomato sauce &quot;marinara&quot; are the Americans. Everywhere else ''pasta alla marinara'' is, you guessed it, pasta with seafood. In Italy, there's no such thing as &quot;marinara sauce&quot;. Please stop perpetuating this foolishness. --[[Special:Contributions/62.163.1.54|62.163.1.54]] ([[User talk:62.163.1.54|discuss]]) 19:47, 12 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

If you have something to say, please create a new section using equal signs = under the main sections. Your comments will all be put into thought. '''DON'T FORGET TO PUT YOUR (USER)NAME IN.'''

== Link Cleanup ==

Most of the plays don't link back to the Contents. We need some help on this! #[[User:Peteturtle|Brandon Johnsonn]] 14:03, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

Further, I just discovered that some links go to Wiksource.org and their William Shakespeare, and not all the links in this book follow in any sort of logical order.  The sonnets, in particular, have the page I started from the Table of Contents, another page that goes to WikiSource, and a page marked for cleanup by [[User:Kermeigh|Kermeigh]].  There's no logic to this at all, and I've done two or three days worth of fairly useless work. :-( -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 19:23, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

Someone has trolled the portrait of Shakespeare and put a ring in his left ear indicating that he was gay. We need a new copy of the portait.

== help? ==
maybe it's a dumb question, but how come &quot;AN UNKNOWN USER APPARENTLY SWIPED AWAY ALL OF THE PLAYS&quot; ? isn't wiki supposed to keep history of everything, in an easily restoreable form?

I checked the history- - - there was no record of anyone erasing the plays. #[[User:Peteturtle|Brandon Johnsonn]] 12:16, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

: The original plays may be found on [[s:|Wikisource]]. Wikibooks is only for annotations. For more, see [[s:Wikisource:Annotations]] and [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]] --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 05:14, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

This Wikibook might need some links organization so that all the pages lead back to the contents, rather than the cover. -- #[[User:Peteturtle|Brandon Johnsonn]] 14:04, 2 June 2006 (UTC))}}

: Your Title/Contents/Chapter convention is not standard and should not be used. I recommend the cover page is removed (or moved to [[William Shakespeare's Works/Cover]] if it must be here), since it adds absolutely no value to this book. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 05:14, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

== Can Anyone find a new portrait of Shakespeare, please? ==
An anonymous visitor to this module disliked the Shakespeare portrait. Anyone, please put in a new portrait of Shakespeare. (See discussion page for more details)

Actually, I think the post requesting the new portrait was an act of vandalism; I think the person knows perfectly well that the earring was in the portrait to begin with and does not indicate that Shakespeare is gay.  There is some doubt, however, about whether the man in the portrait is actually Shakespeare; on these grounds it may be worth the effort, but I think we have more important things to take care of ATM.

== Adding Original Texts ==

Many original texts have been added here even though there is a warning on the front page of this book telling users not to.  I propose we give the text 10 days, and if the text has not been annotated by that time, then we tag it for deletion.  Is everyone in agreement on this? --[[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] 14:51, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

On the contents page, the note says to merge Introduction to William Shakespeare to this page. If someone will tell me how to merge a page, I will do it! Tannersf 18:34 October 2, 2006 (UTC)

== Please Help! ==

Please help fix where it says that Comedy of Errors is 10% finished. It should be on the 00% to 25% development stage, which is no squares filled in. Thanks! 

-Tannersf-


Under the sections where the box is empty click edit and change the percentages when they reach the correct level of them being finished. Because i don't know a lot about this project i can only give you the foundation for them. The percentages should be either 00%, 25%, 50%, or 100% complete. I would like for you to do this so it will be easier to tell when your book is close to completion. Thanks. I hope it's not too much trouble. --[[User:Xxagile|Xxagile]] ([[User talk:Xxagile|talk]]) 07:00, 11 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

== The Last Ice Age   ==

{{TODO|Need facts check, like names and dates}}

Perhaps it would be better to call it the '''most recent Ice Age''', because in fact, the Earth has had many Ice Ages. A British scientist first uncovered evidence of an ice age in the 1800s. At first he was ridiculed, because some people did not believe the Earth was more than 10,000 years old.  Yet since then ''climatologists'', people who study long-term weather conditions, have found at least four earlier ice ages, and an older age for the Earth has become generally accepted.
   
Ice Ages tend to be similar every time they occur. The whole planet becomes significantly cooler, and a vast majority of the planet's water becomes locked in ice at high altitudes and at the North and South Poles.  Sea levels drop precipitously, and a sheet of ice extends outwards from the poles and from high mountains like the Alps in Europe and the Rockies in North America to cover huge swaths of the planet's land area.  The ice sheet can be more than a mile thick in places, and the ice is so heavy, and moves so forcefully in places, that the underlying soil is ripped up, and the bedrock below the soil is pummeled, cracked and ground into huge boulders and tiny pebbles. Everywhere else, sea levels drop about fifty feet -- shorelines in some places stretch outwards more than a mile beyond the present shores, and numerous small islands and shoals appear even beyond that. 

The last Ice Age, which geologists call the Würm III Ice Age, lasted from about 20,000 years ago until about 15,000 years ago.  All of Canada and much of the United States were swaddled in ice sheets as far south as Oregon, Wyoming, Illinois and Pennsylvania.  Europe north of the Alps was almost totally covered, as was much of central Russia.  Tibet, western China and northern India vanished under the ice buildup on the Himalayas. World temperatures dropped an average of 12° F, enough to make even Florida or India unpleasantly cool.

== Hunting and Gathering ==
Anthropologists think that at the start of the last Ice Age, the human population of Earth was less than a million people. Their existence revolved around a style of living which still exists today, although it is gradually disappearing everywhere, by a combination of acculturation, economic, political and social pressures.

One should note that hunter-gatherers are so limited, in their way of life, by several factors. It may be only lack of knowhow or freedom and safety in settling or a need to maintain environmental sustainability. People who practice this way of life are defined as ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Hunter-Gatherer|hunter-gatherers]]'' and it is often a transitory state in a society evolution due the its precarity.

Hunter-gatherers do not grow plants or raise animals for food. Instead, they practice a lifestyle in which the men go out to hunt wild animals every few days, while the women gather wild but edible plants and wild but useful medicinal plants every few days. In any case animal domestication should not be excluded from the definition of a hunter-gatherer societies, but not as part of a very complex methodology of animals husbandry, even if they could also be see those animals as a food resource. Dogs for instance seem to have been domesticated more than 18,000 years ago. Note that we are defining the term to frame Neolithic Age societies (10,200 BC to 4,500 or 2,000 BC) not those that we may still define as hunter-gatherers today. By the end of the Neolithic, larger human societies were enabled by.   

In hunter-gatherer cultures; There is usually a very strong division of labor between the sexes  though men may gather some plants, and women may do some hunting, the expectation is usually strong that women will stay close to a family's camp while the men go far afield in search of food.

Every few months, as these resources become scarce in one region, the people pack up their few belongings and move to a new location within their territory. Each family may have a territory of hundreds of square miles over which they may range quite broadly in the course of a year, living off of what the land produces. A hunter-gatherer family might have a dozen favorite campsites, with one on the seashore, one by a lake, one in the hills and one in the woods. Fish and shellfish form their seashore diet while they make baskets from marsh reeds; by the lake they may eat deer and make arrows and spears from nearby trees; in the hills they eat mountain goats and make stone tools from a deposit of obsidian; in the forest they eat birds and fill their baskets with nuts and fruits for the winter.   

Hunter-gathering is a remarkably simple life, and it is the way of life practiced by humans and hominids since back into the Paleolithic age's earliest years, as near as modern scientists can agree. People tend to have very few possessions, because they are very mobile, and they have no animals to help them carry their gear from one place to another. A tent may be the most elaborate piece of equipment the whole family owns. Modern hunter-gatherer clans tend to have fairly long life expectancies, usually around 70 years of age; some modern developing societies do not have such long life spans as hunter-gatherers do.

Today we can only guess at the lifestyles of ancient hunter-gatherers, based on modern examples. Most hunter-gatherers live and travel in ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Extended Families|extended families]]'' of at least three generations -- grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, as well as children. Older children take care of the youngest and the oldest. The family has to take care of all the needs of all its members, because there is no larger society to take on the work of caring for the elderly or educating the littlest ones. Aunts help mothers watch the youngest children, and collect the necessary plants to keep the family fed and healthy; uncles help train young boys to hunt smaller animals, and to help on the hunts for larger game.  The same was probably true of ancient hunter-gatherers, as well.

Additionally, anthropologists and historians speculate that hunter-gatherer families 20,000 years ago belonged to larger groups called ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#tribe|tribes]]''.  Tribes are clusters of families bound together by common taboos and beliefs for social advantage.  While families lived on their own most of the time, such an existence in an otherwise empty landscape would have been difficult, especially if every other family was potentially an enemy.  Thus, some families that spoke the same or similar languages would form alliances with one another, by marrying their children into one another's bloodlines, and by trading luxury goods, and feasting together.  As families became too large to live together, they would bud off into new extended families that remained attached to the old relationships with other families.  Strangers who proved their usefulness and loyalty could also marry into these arrangements, giving them both protection and responsibility.

In this way, different families and peoples experimented with the most useful prohibitions, prescriptions and modalities for living in a complex world. The tribes formed a social network which made it possible for individuals to travel great distances in relative safety. However, tribes may have also led to conflict, as different tribes began competing for water, food and other resources.  Tribes may have also become so large that they subdivided, with clans existing as groups of families within the larger tribes.  

Clans and tribes also offered opportunities for leadership.It is believed that leadership of these tribes was reserved for men, especially due to inter-tribal violence for the preservation of territory. Within an extended family, the oldest adult usually has tremendous influence and receives the respect of his or her descendants, for living so long and the experience he has. Keeping in mind that in the Neolithic the medium life expectancy is 20 years. The eldest man ruled until his death. However, within a tribe issues other than age may be a factor in choosing a leader. Some tribes may have chosen the biggest and bravest as their leaders, while others may have chosen the wisest or the most clever. Many modern hunter-gatherer tribes, and presumably ancient tribes as well, gradually developed four types of leader: the big man, who was usually the most important hunter; the chief, who was usually an older man or woman who was respected because of years of experience; the medicine man or woman, or ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Shaman|shaman]]'', who worked with plants and minerals to cure the illnesses and injuries of the tribe; and the ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Artisan|artisan]]'', who was particularly skilled at manufacturing goods necessary to the tribe's survival such as spears, baskets or clothing. 

The beginning of the Ice Age must have startled and surprised these leaders and their dependents and followers a great deal.  Colder temperatures and ice probably killed some tribes completely.  Others moved toward the equator, seeking warmer temperatures and easier living conditions.  Some must have stayed near the ice and weathered the cold, changing their habits and patterns of living to accommodate the change in environment.

However, the end of the most recent Ice Age around 12,000 years ago, put even greater pressures on the tribes that survived than the beginning had.  As temperatures and sea levels rose, the Earth experienced a substantial die-off of plant and animal types.  Some historians blame this pattern of extinction on our earliest ancestors; others attribute it to rapid climate change unrelated to human activity.  Neither side has a total lock on the truth at this point.  There is no solid evidence to prove the debate either way.  

What is true is that many tribes, particularly in areas that received little rainfall or where few animals lived to begin with, needed to find new food and medicine sources.  Part of the reason for the search for new foods may have been not simply that old foods were running out, but that our post-Ice Age ancestors had developed a taste for new things, and had invented a custom called ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#feasting|feasting]].''

=== Feasting ===

Imagine that it is a major festival at your house.  All your relatives and some of your family's friends are coming over for dinner.  Your parents have gone shopping for food several times over the last few days, and everyone is bringing a favorite dish to eat.  Some of the foods that will be served are traditional; you have the same things every year at this time.  Other foods are novelties -- no one except the person who brought it has ever tried it before, and you are all either eager, or nervous (or both!) to try it.  If the new food is good, everyone wants to have seconds, there is none left over, and all the guests want the recipe.  The guest who served the dish can be sure of a repeat invitation.  A disgusting dish will still be there at the end of the night, and no one wants to keep the leftovers.  

Prehistoric feasting was probably quite similar.  Within a small family, the question of who was the leader was probably not disputed often: the kids were kids, the adults were adults, and the adults tended to listen to one person's opinion of what everyone should do.  However, tribes were more capable of being influenced by outside factors.  A good meal, with decorations and entertainment, was likely to sway an important decision one way or the other.  The hosts of a good meal could show that their way of thinking was superior, because it allowed them to have access to extra food that fed and brought happiness to more people.

Where did all the extra food come from? Remember that, unlike your family, there is no market or grocery store for finding the ingredients of these celebrations.  Every other day or so, the men and women of the tribe have to go out into wild countryside to find food, water, and medicines.  How did they find enough time to find enough food to feed all those people, when they were already working hard to find enough food for the immediate family?

What did they eat?

== Domestication ==

Through a process called ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Domestication|domestication]]'', early humans began controlling the development of a number of plant and animal species.  They probably began by planting the seeds of their favorite foods in gardens, in order to harvest luxury or high-status foods like fruit, berries, nuts or grains. By cultivating small plots of land, human families would gain substantial riches, both in terms of surplus food and status.  The plants that produced the most food would be bred with each other, in order to produce a more reliable crop with greater substance useful to humans.  A similar process developed fiber plants like cotton, flax and hemp.  In like manner, other human tribes took the effort to capture live samples of their favorite food animals, from cattle and camels to reindeer and sheep.  By killing off the most aggressive males in a herd, and breeding animals according to traits which humans found desirable, these early pastoralists created modern farm animals.

=== Domestication of Animals ===

Domestication of animals began earlier, at least as far as modern historians know.  Because bones fossilize over time, and because they can remain intact in dry and pH-neutral soil longer, they appear in the fossil record much earlier than any sign of domesticated plants.  Dogs appear to be the oldest domesticated species, and they may have been domesticated by the late Paleolithic age, around 20,000 years ago.  Dogs made the crossing to the Americas with Siberian Ice Age hunter-gatherers, but no other domestic species made the transition.  However, dogs did not cross into Australia with the people who became the Australian Aboriginals 40,000 years ago.  The date of canine domestication is thus a little confusing.  

However, the real appearance of domesticated animals begins much later. Sheep and Goat (Capra aegagrus hircus) appearing in 8000 BCE. The domestic cat (''Felis domesticus''), thought to descent from a few as five self-domesticating African Wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) c. 8000 BCE, in the Near East, was found in the form in a kitten that was buried alongside a human in Cyprus, dating 7500 BCE. The Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) in 6000 BCE. The Dromedary Camel (Camelus dromedarius) appear to have been domesticated by about 4000 BCE and the Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) around 2500 BCE. The Horse (Equus ferus caballus) also join them around 4000 BCE, as well as Cattle (Bos primigenius taurus) and the Duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus).

The example of horned goats is instructive.  At sites dated between 7000 and 6000 BCE, goat horns appear in the middens of ancient peoples living in the Near East.  All of these goat horns have a slightly curved profile, like a scimitar or other curving sword blade, suitable for ramming and goring another goat, or a predator, or a human who got too close.  At sites dated between 6000 and 5000 BCE, a new type of goat horn appears, representing maybe 10% of the total.  These horns, instead of being wicked tools for battle, have become curled and twisted.  Between 5000 and 3000 BCE, the number of twisted goat horns remains fairly steady.  However, by 2500 BCE, twisted and curled goat horns have become the norm, and represent 80% of the finds.  By 1500 BCE, they represent 100% of the finds; the wild goat with its sharp and vicious horns had been replaced by a domesticated goat with twisted horns.  Where the wild goat's horns could kill a man with a single strike, the twisted horns might batter someone but leave him alive.

From this, modern historians deduced that horn shape was not the only characteristic which early human breeding programs sought to preserve and pass on to future generations.  Early humans must have also been concerned with things like meat, milk, and wool — all useful products derived from both goats and sheep, as well as other animals.  Additionally, for most of the period covered by this book, most parts of the Near East were not typically well-settled, and the goat-herders must have preferred that their animals had some ability to defend themselves against predators such as wolves and lions.  Historians call people who herd animals for their living, and who derive only minimal benefit from farming, ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Pastoralists|pastoralists]].''  All types of animal-rearing, taking into account both pastoralism and farming, is called ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Animal Husbandry|animal husbandry]].''  Animal husbandry lends itself well to a variation on the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, in which ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Nomads|nomads]]'', or people who travel widely seeking food for their herds or flocks, roam between several areas which provide food and water for both themselves and the animals they tend.

=== Domestication of Plants ===

Domestication of plants followed a similar but later process to the domestication of animals.  Historians term all sorts of deliberate human growth of plants, ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Cultivation|cultivation]].''  Cultivation is a process by which humans plant seeds, care for the seedlings, harvest the mature plants and store some seeds for future use even while eating the majority of the harvest.

Most wild plants do not produce many seeds.  They do not flood the ground around them with seeds, because any such seeds will quite naturally compete with the mother plant that created the seeds in the first place.  Birds and animals may carry a number of seeds away in their feces, but the majority of new plants wind up competing for the same ground in the same ecological niche.  Humans changed the balance of nature by first identifying plants that were good to eat, and then establishing seeds from those plants under favorable growing conditions.  

The first type of cultivation, then, was probably  ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Horticulture|horticulture]].''  Horticulture is the care and tending of gardens — small plots of land yielding a variety of plant products for the use of an extended family or tribe.  Many tribal peoples, including nomads, found horticulture to be a highly successful strategy for feeding themselves.  In many areas, horticulturalists employed a technique called the ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Slash-And-Burn|slash-and-burn]]'' technique to prepare their garden areas.  The largest and least useful trees in a proposed garden were de-barked in a broad ring at the base of the tree; the gardeners cut down smaller trees and shrubs with knives and axes.  The whole area was then burned, creating a bed of ashes from the dead plant material.  The garden would thrive for several years in the ashes, before the soil nutrients became exhausted; then the gardeners would move on.  

A second, later type of cultivation is called ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Agriculture|agriculture]].''  Where horticulturalists establish small gardens supporting a variety of useful plants, agriculture involves converting large stretches of territory to a single plant, in essence creating fields.  Evidence of agriculture, as opposed to horticulture, does not appear in the archaeological record until about 4500 BCE, when it made rapid inroads in five areas world-wide.  These five areas are sometimes called cultural hearths, for their role in helping establish both culture and civilization in their regions of the world.  Each area developed a particular group of food and fiber plants for cultivation in fields, and these plants remain the core of the modern world's diet today.

Four of these areas came into existence in the Old World: Africa, Asia, and Europe.  Because these areas were located in river valleys, the archaeological record is somewhat confused about which area arose first, and which has the best claim to be the origin place of agriculture.  The best guess is that they each invented agriculture independently of one another.  The first area is '''[[Ancient History/Egypt|Egypt]]''', whose Nile River became a garden country quite early, involved in the production of domesticated cotton, wheat and barley.  The Tigris and Euphrates river valley, commonly called '''[[Ancient History/Ancient Near East/Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]]''', was the second region, and it was involved in the cultivation of barley, wheat, and hemp.  The Indus River valley in '''[[Ancient History/Indian subcontinent|India]]''' was the third region, involved in cultivating rice, barley, beans and other crops.  The fourth region of the Old World was '''[[Ancient History/China|China]]''', which produced rice, wheat and lentils.

The fifth region followed a substantially different pattern.  Mesoamerica, or southern Mexico and the nations of Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and El Salvador, had no vast river systems in which to build elaborate agricultural systems.  Here, agriculture grew out of horticulture, as the gardens needed to sustain the local populations became larger and larger.  In about 5200 BCE, a local grain called ''teosinte'' became the focus of an intense breeding program.  By 2500 BCE, its seed stalks had doubled in size, and the seeds themselves had also doubled.  By 1 CE, these seed stalks had increased in size by another third. This plant is today known as ''maize'' or corn, and it formed the basis of the diet of the Americas from around 2000 BCE even to the present day.  Mesoamerica also domesticated a whole host of other plants, including cotton, chili peppers, gourds, squash, melons and potatoes.  All of these modern-day agricultural crops originally came from Mesoamerican gardens.

== Early Settlements ==

Early humans may have seeded gardens at one campsite, and then gone on to visit other campsites for several months before returning to check on their plants.  They would have found at least some of their efforts trampled or eaten by wild animals, stripped of their leaves by ravenous insects, or eaten by other hunter-gatherer family groups.  Although the earliest tribes to practice horticulturalism may not have had strong senses of ownership over their gardens, later generations might have felt seriously inconvenienced, or perhaps even robbed.  They would make plans to stay at campsites with gardens over longer periods of time, and harvested the results of their efforts.  If they had planned on using the produce from their gardens for the purposes of holding a celebratory feast, they may have been even more irritated than usual with the thieves.

These humans usually developed their gardening campsites a little more thoroughly than they might at hunting or gathering grounds.  Occasionally buildings of rough stones and roofed with branches and straw replaced tents.  People dug wells or cisterns to provide local water sources for animals and people; they also dug irrigation ditches to provide water to their gardens in dry seasons.  As people invested more time and energy into their camps and gardens, packing up and moving to a new campsite became less and less desirable.  Eventually, people may have just decided to stick by their gardens year by year.  The hunter-gatherers, once nomadic, now became sedentary.



== Modern ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' ==

By the start of the Neolithic Age around 10,000 years ago, modern humans or ''Homo sapiens sapiens'' had become the dominant primate species on the planet.  Except for a few islands in the Pacific, humans had spread to every land in the world, from the highlands of the Himalayas to the Amazon basin.  Hawaii would not be colonized until about 500 CE, while New Zealand would remain empty of human settlement until about 900 CE.  Otherwise, humans were everywhere.

It is difficult to say just how culturally diverse humanity was, just at the end of the last Ice Age.  The stone tools and small figurines called ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Venuses|Venuses]]'' found at many early Neolithic sites suggest a remarkable uniformity of culture.  However, humans tended to make stone cutting tools out of only four basic types of rock: chert, flint, obsidian and quartzite.  The flaking properties of these stones lend themselves to particular shapes and forms quite well, but these prevent substantial differentiation in types.  Some forms are sufficiently widespread and unique to be identified with specific cultures: the Clovis People of New Mexico, for example left behind spearpoints with a distinctive ogival shape and a thumb-shaped groove for binding the point onto a wooden spear half.  A great many stone and bone tools, though, are anonymously uniform, carrying over their shapes from one generation to the next over thousands of years.

However, modern culture is not written in tools so much as in materials and gear that rot and decay.  A young man in Europe and a young man in India and a young man in South America dressed very differently from one another in 5000 BCE, largely as a result of where they lived.  Each spoke a different language from the others; each may have used similar tool sets, but one used that toolkit to hunt elk and moose, another to hunt cassowary, and another to hunt water buffalo.  Each heard different stories from their elders, and wanted different things in life from one another.  Each even had different standards of beauty when considering potential mates and marriage partners.  In the same way, a Chinese woman, an Egyptian woman and a Mesoamerican woman learned to cook with different foods, and worked with different materials to clothe their families. They told their children different bedtime stories, played different games, and had different standards of beauty and ability when considering potential mates and marriage partners.  

It is difficult to assess today what these ancient cultures looked like.  However, by 4500 BCE the world was a patchwork of cultures.  Some were gardeners, some were farmers, some were pastoralists, and some were hunter-gatherers.  Some were straddling the dividing lines between methods of food production, and some people were actively traveling back and forth between different groups, carrying luxury food items, beads, precious stones and other goods between cultures, peoples and individuals.  There were thousands of languages and millions of people world-wide. There may have been nations and kingdoms, but we know almost nothing about them, not even whether they existed.  Writing was still more than a thousand years in the future.

Yet for archaeologists, things were about to get very interesting indeed.

      <comment>/* The Principle */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Principle==

Fermat's Principle, also known as &quot;The Principle of Least Time&quot; states that:

: &quot;Light travels through the path in which it can reach the destination in least time&quot;.

It is a fundamental law of optics from which the other laws of geometrical optics can be derived.

== Derivation for Law of Reflection ==
The derivation of Law of [[Reflection]] using [[Fermat's principle]] is straightforward. The Law of [[Reflection]] can be derived using elementary [[calculus]] and [[trigonometry]]. The generalization of the Law of Reflection is [[Snell's law]], which is derived below using the same principle.

The medium that light travels through doesn't change. In order to minimize the time for light travel between two points, we should minimize the path taken.

[[File:Lawofreflection.png|thumb|right|θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = θ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection]]

1. Total path length of the light is given by

:&lt;math&gt;L=d_1+d_2\,&lt;/math&gt;

2. Using [[Pythagorean theorem]] from [[Euclidean Geometry]] we see that

:&lt;math&gt;d_1=\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_2=\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

3. When we substitute both values of d&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for above, we get 

:&lt;math&gt;L=\sqrt{x^2 + a^2} + \sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}&lt;/math&gt;

4. In order to minimize the path traveled by light, we take the first [[derivative]] of L with respect to x. 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dL}{dx}=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} + \frac{-(l-x)}{\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

5. Set both sides equal to each other.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} = \frac{(l-x)}{\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

6. We can now tell that the left side is nothing but &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; and the right side &lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_r&lt;/math&gt; means

:&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta_i=\sin\theta_r \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

7. Taking the [[Inverse trigonometric function|inverse sine]] of both sides we see that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_i=\theta_r \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

== Derivation for Snell's Law ==

The derivation of Snell's Law using [[Fermat's Principle]] is straightforward. Snell's Law can be derived using elementary [[calculus]] and [[trigonometry]]. Snell's Law is the generalization of the above in that it does not require the medium to be the same everywhere.

[[File:Snellslaw_diagram2.png|thumb|right|Snell's law relates n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

To mark the speed of light in different media refractive indices named n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are used. 
:&lt;math&gt;v_1=\frac{c}{n_1} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v_2=\frac{c}{n_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum and &lt;math&gt;n_1,n_2 \ge 1 \,&lt;/math&gt; because all materials slow down light as it travels through them. 

1. Time for the trip equals distance traveled divided by the speed.

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{d_1}{v_1}+\frac{d_2}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;

2. Using the [[Pythagorean theorem]] from [[Euclidean Geometry]] we see that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d_1}{v_1}=\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_1}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d_2}{v_2}=\frac{\sqrt{b^2 + (l-x)^2}}{v_2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

3. Substituting this result into equation (1) we get 

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{v_1} + \frac{\sqrt{b^2 + (l-x)^2}}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;

4. To minimize the transit time, we take the derivative with respect to the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and set it equal to zero:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{dx}=\frac{x}{v_1\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}} + \frac{-(l-x)}{v_2\sqrt{(l-x)^2 + b^2}}=0&lt;/math&gt;

5. After careful examination the above equation we see that it is nothing but

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dT}{dx}=\frac{\sin\theta_1}{v_1} - \frac{\sin\theta_2}{v_2}=0&lt;/math&gt;

6. This leads to 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin\theta_1}{v_1}=\frac{\sin\theta_2}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt;

7. Substituting &lt;math&gt;\frac{n_1}{c}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v_1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{n_2}{c}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v_2}&lt;/math&gt; we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n_1}{c}\sin\theta_1=\frac{n_2}{c}\sin\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;

8. Multiplying through by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; gives us our result

:&lt;math&gt;n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_2 \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Deletion against community consensus ==
Hello Jon,

I'd like to ask you to revert your deletion of [[Transwiki:List_of_tongue-twisters]] (done at 18:29, 29 May 2006) because the result of the debate was '''Transwiki''' (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_tongue-twisters]). I'm afraid it would be somewhat unfair to act against community consensus. On the discussion page, nobody at all proposed, supported or agreed on deletion.

This list was a considerable collection made by several people during years, something that is certainly of interest by illustrating the differences of languages in terms of [[:w:phonology|phonology]], [[:w:morphonology|morphonology]] and [[:w:morphophonemic|morphophonemic]], and I doubt how it could be &quot;not suitable for wikibooks&quot;.

Thank you! [[User:Adam78|Adam78]] 14:12, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

:I have sent you an email containing the deleted text and noting why it is unsuitable for wikibooks and should not have been sent here by wikipedia in the first instance. I am willing to extend this courtesy to others (provided they are not too many), but really an admin on wikipedia should undelete the content from there to allow the page to be transwikied to a suitable location. If the email does not arrive (it was somewhat large), please let me know, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:23, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

I need to learn how to make new pages within my book. I tried openning a new empty link, would it be connected to my book automatically ?
Also, I don't mind to find someone reviewing my english, since it not my native language.

Never mind what I just said! I can't believe you deleted my Shakespeare's Works wikibook! I was going to use your critism to make it better, but you deleted it! I worked for one hour on trying to get just right (that includes &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot;)&lt;Br&gt;
Next time, please confer with the author before deleting their book!&lt;br&gt;

You recently noticed my Shakespeare plays Wikibook. I thank your criticism. Your idea is good: I should make a section only on information on the play. Check back on Comedies---Midsummer Night's Dream later to see what I mean. 
Thank you for your help, Peteturtle.

Hello,

I just wanted to drop by to tell you that the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is actualy &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|reason for delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. We administators are very carefull about deletions and we need a reason before we delete.

== OrthopAEdic vs OrthopEdic ==

I have already talked about this in length [[Talk:Medicine_bookshelf#Attention_Daniel575:_Orthopaedic_vs_Orthopedic|elsewhere]]. Though you have already gone ahead and changed [[Orthopedic Surgery]] to [[Orthopaedic Surgery]] I would like to have your views on the topic.

OK, I've moved the pages. However, the redirects must not be deleted, because of outside linking and personal bookmarks. [[user:tsca|tsca]] [[user talk:tsca|✉]] 12:21, 25 February 2006 (UTC)


What do we do about converting some  this stuff back? I lost all my links to &quot;Additional Training Materials&quot;. This could really take awhile trying to find them all.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 04:55, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

I have lost A LOT of stuff. SOMEBODY CONVERT THIS STUFF BACK. There is no way I can search for it all... it took too much time to do this.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 05:03, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for your prompt reply. Ok... I freaked out for a moment. Please accept my apologies. Here's apparently what the bot does. It did pick up most of the links. However, those links to the .pdf's and some of the images did not. If I am understanding what the bot did, it did great as far as anything on Wikibooks, but doesn't like anything that has been linked into Commons. That's my guess because the pages that had links to Commons was not picked up... those that were to Wikibooks locations were. If that could be fixed, whoever developed the bot will have created an avenue to save all of us a lot of work. He can go in and look to see what linked and what didnt. Areas where it didnt link I just reset the pages to the old links so its easy to see. Hope that helps and let me know if that gets fixed as it is a really great resource.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 18:16, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

== Congratulations on becoming an admin ==

I see that you have been granted admin status.  The first clue was that the total number of modules as listed on the front page has actually gone down by a couple hundred from yesterday, so I took a look at the deletion log to see what you were up to.

I have no complaint, and thank you for helping out Wikibooks, doing the service that you have been performing.  I also want to thank you for your efforts over the past month or so here, and they are very much appreciated as well.  If you get a chance, please review [[MediaWiki Administrator's Handbook]] and add some input about what kinds of things you are not quite sure about or would like some more information regarding administrator duties.  This is just an ordinary Wikibook, so nothing is sacred there or is official policy.  It is just a casual guide to perhaps let you know what kinds of things may be useful to a new administrator and what &quot;tricks&quot; have been useful to others.

I need to do this more myself, so don't take this personally and treat this advise with a grain of salt as well (this is just my opinion on the matter): don't hesitate to still add the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tag to content that you think needs to be deleted.  This way you can get a second opinion on removing the content and it can act as a check on yourself so you don't accidentally delete something that perhaps should have been kept.  I've steped on enough toes already as an administrator that there are some serious arrows in my back due to mistakes in this area.

Again, thanks for being involved with Wikibooks, and let's make this an awesome project!  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:16, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

I wanted to say that I sincerely thank-you for the rename of [[America%27s_Army:_Special_Forces]] and the removal of the link back to the contents. It makes things much more sensible.

I do have one concern, which is that originally the 'book' was mostly aimed at the tactics related to the game, rather than the game as a whole, so I'm not positive that the new name is specific enough. No worries though. I'm sure it can be changed in the future.

==Bartending==
Wooah steady there Jguk youve deleted quite a few pages without even leaving redirects or any edit history. I'm really not keen on lumping recipes together and using big unwieldly lists. I'd much rather keep recipes seperate and make use of categories it makes things a lot easier. Could you please restore the deleted pages and we'll start up some discussion on the format. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 00:02, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

At first glance youve been copying what ive been doing in the ingredients section which is something i was trying out some ideas with but that structure simply doesnt work for cocktails, eg a black velvet is a cocktail with beer and youve put it on the cocktails with beer page, but its also a cocktail with champagne and youve duplicated the recipe there too. things are going to get real messy and confused doing things that way, the ingredients im not sure about but the cocktails absolutely need their own pages using categorys. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 00:35, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

: Jguk, I don't think anyone (and especially a sysop) should completely alter book structure without discussion. I expect you will consult Discordance on how to correct current book shape. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:08, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

I was retaining (but simplifying) book structure. I am considering my response to Discordance and have laid off editing that wikibook for a few days. I think the issue to be resolved is whether there is a better structure than that already adopted - and will respond with my thoughts shortly, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 22:12, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

Thats cool I was still experimenting with the structure myself, I just felt that deleting the pages left me with no way back lacking admin tools, I dont like unecessary redirects but theres a fair bit of edit history gone. Having lots of short articles isnt the best of situations i agree, but theres so many ways to categorise cocktails and so many recipes to add I really feel the only way it can be done is with a seperate article for each recipe. Even if we come up with a different structure though i'd like to see the pages restored for the sake of edit histories. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 19:27, 23 March 2006 (UTC)

Hi Jguk, I seem to also be having trouble due to whatever changes have been made regarding the bartending/cocktails articles.  We have broken links all over wikipedia now to these articles.  I have fixed a bunch of them, but many of the articles seem to have vanished completely from wikibooks, from what I can tell.  Are they somewhere unexpected, or planned to be returned, or have they simply been deleted?  I understand that these bartending articles transwikied from wikipedia tend to be low quality, but still it would be good to know which ones were deleted (if possible) to aid in removing dead links.  Or if you can just verify that there are no bartending articles left besides the ones in the main obviously visible categories, I'll just assume any others are gone for good.  Thanks  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 14:17, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

:''Added to Xyzzyplugh's talk page:''

:Thank you for your comment on my talk page.

:I have (I hope temporarily) restored all the bartending pages (see [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixindex&amp;from=Bartending&amp;namespace=0 here] for a complete list of pages in the book. In each case the content of the pages beginning Bartending/Cocktails has already been merged into another article linked from [[Bartending/Cocktails]], which is why I believe the old links to be unnecessary. However, I will discuss this with the main authors of the book.

:Incidentally, when linking to Wikibooks, I strongly recommend always linking to the book's title. Other pages in any book are subject to significant change (such as the merging of articles here followed by deletion of the old location spaces). On Wikibooks, whilst we tend to have redirects for book titles and bookshelves, we don't for pages and chapters of books (if we did we'd have more redirects than articles!).

:All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 08:12, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
::Thanks for the link to all the articles.  I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;always linking to the book's title&quot;, though.  The links I've been using within wikipedia end up like this: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Irish_Carbomb  is this correct?  The original links looked like this: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending:Boiler  and they all went dead, none of them work anymore, so I've been switching them to the new links.  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 09:44, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

Thank you, well i was hoping that if enough momentum built up for the book we'd be able to produce recipe pages of similar quality to that of the cookbook, thats what i was attempting with the [[Bartending/Cocktails/B-52|B-52]], there are a lot of ways to index the cocktails and with the vast number we will hopefully have its important to be able to find what your looking for, at the moment the B-52 has roughly the same sortof categories as a cookbook recipe, method and ingredients but theres the possibility of alcohol content and flavour (a little subjective but might be nice). For group pages you do run into the major problem of figuring out where to put the cocktail each time as repeating the recipe is not a good idea thats going to make it harder to keep things tidy, then once youve decided where things go the reader then has to figure out where its actually been put. I think good indexing is very important for this book. The ingredients and glassware etc do favour a hierarchal structure as on the whole theres only one way to classify and group them and theres a lot less that can be said about them in a cocktail context. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 13:52, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

Hi, I am sending this same message to both you and Discordance, you're the two who I know are paying attention to the bartending area of wikibooks.  I've just transwikied about 90 articles on cocktails, I moved most of them to the Bartending/Cocktails/ area, and added the barwork tag to them all.  Except for about the following, which had previously existing articles here.  These will all need to be merged, or will need to replace the previously existing articles if they are better, perhaps.  I'm not sure what the procedure is on this, how do I go about doing this properly while still maintaining the history and all?  Here is the list:
*‎Transwiki:Black Velvet 
*‎Transwiki:Brandtea 
*‎Transwiki:Brandy Alexander 
*‎Transwiki:Cosmopolitan 
*‎Transwiki:French 75 
*‎Transwiki:Golden Cadillac 
*‎Transwiki:Margarita 
*‎Transwiki:Mojito 
*‎Transwiki:Prairie Oyster this is not strictly speaking an alcoholic beverage, not sure what to do with it
*‎Transwiki:Rob Roy 
*‎Transwiki:Sidecar 
*‎Transwiki:Slippery Nipple 
*‎Transwiki:Sloe Gin Fizz 
And http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Prarie_Fire  I realized there is another article here with the spelling Prairie Fire.
--[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 15:48, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

You havnt replied on the bartending page but have started moving cocktails can I assume that your ok with me then creating individual articles of high quality? Also have you done anything with the edit history?, I think you should probably have left redirects instead. But oh well. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 19:22, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

Thats great to hear I do intend to work on a lot of recipes. As for the AMF it should be written out in full as it is a name, however i have been thinking about modern cocktails and whether they should perhaps be seperated somewhat from 'classic' cocktails. For instance a Don Quixote is half guiness and half tequila, a drink i have tried once on a drunken evening but its clearly been designed for a digusting drinking game rather than an actual cocktail. I cant really decide at the moment whether to treat everything as a cocktail or to try to make some kind of separation. [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 23:51, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

Rereading some of you comments on my talk page perhaps things like the AMF and other modern cocktails should just be left in the glossary and only 'classic' cocktails should get their own pages. The only fair way to decide what is a 'classic' cocktail would be whether or not the cocktail has made it into a printed cocktail book (but not novelty shots books). [[User:88.144.26.238|88.144.26.238]] 15:14, 8 April 2006 (UTC)

The problem with throwing everything into a glossary index is that drinks are not simply recipes.  Qualified bartenders learn how to develop new cocktails, which requires a theoretical education, not just a list of names and constituents with no indication of what's important and what isn't, how the ingredients function in a cocktail, etc.  In particular, families of cocktails need to be linked together.  A glossary would be a good place to put things like long lists of shooters or punches, but there is no way that anyone is going to learn to bartend well if his only exposure to the martini is a single paragraph.  --[[User:Dan131m|Dan131m]]

I'll try to prepare and photograph all of the cocktails I wrote up soon.  Don't worry about merging the information from the glossary into the articles, because in most cases the glossary information on the more important cocktails is either unimportant to a working bartender or could be summarized and formatted in a much simpler manner.  --[[User:Dan131m|Dan131m]]

==Cheers for the welcome==
Thanks for the welcome message, but I don't expect to be very active here at Wikibooks. I'd like to help, but I'm doing lots of categorisation work at Commons, which takes up pretty much all of my non-wikipedia wiki time. [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] 23:46, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

== Concerns about some of your deletion ==

I want to start out that I appreciate that you have been very helpful about clearing out some of the deadwood here on Wikibooks, 99.9% of which really needed to go from even my perspective.  This is something that has been long overdue and simply needed somebody to step in and get the job done.  For that I am grateful and want to encourage your continued participation on Wikibooks.

I'm just a little worried that perhaps you are going a little bit too far on deleting some of the content that you have removed in the past couple of days.  Noting especially the VfD discussions, try to make sure that the discussion has wound down before going and deleting the content listed there.  Wikibooks moves at a much slower pace than projects like Wikipedia, and it simply takes time to get all of the interested parties to be able to participate in a discussion.

I'm especially concerned about [[Wikilanguages]], as this really has been a new Wikimedia project proposal that perhaps should have been moved to Meta or at least the author given a chance to move it to Wikicities.  In the past, project like this were openly encouraged by several individuals, mostly those who didn't really understand the role of Wikibooks.  Indeed several pages on Meta at one point strongly suggested that Wikibooks was precisely the place to put content of this nature.  I've revised those pages to make it clear that Wikibooks is not the place to put stuff like that, but there were many new projects that were started unfortunately like [[Wikijunior]] where the content is loosly book-like but really has nothing to do with textbooks at all.  BTW, I'm not yet prepared to fight a VfD over Wikijunior, as it would get a bunch of very irate individuals involved in that process.

I know that you and I have some differing philosophies on this and other topics, although I'd also like to point out that there are very few instances I've reversed your decision to delete content.  Please keep in mind that some real people have put quite a bit of effort into much of the content you are now removing. Once it is gone it is difficult to bring it back, which is one reason why adminship is something that is reserved to trusted users.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:34, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

The following response has been posted on Rob's talk page:

Rob

Thank you for your comment on my talk page. On the specific point on Wikilanguages, I have now restored the book - but please note that the vfd had gone on for 11 days with all the votes being to delete when I removed it. I appreciate you take a different view from me as to whether the vote should have been acted on this early, which is why I am happy to restore it following your comment, although I will note that you yourself have deleted something that's been on VFD for only four days where you have seen a clear consensus to delete. I suppose my point here is that it is clear that we are both here to improve wikibooks - whilst we may disagree on some points, I trust that this overriding aim will help us work together in maintaining wikibooks as a useful resource.

On the more general issue, when I came to wikibooks, it was clear that it had an identity crisis, which had seen a number of splits - the cookbook, wikijunior and wikiversity in particular had all been split off in some way. There was no standard naming convention, so each book looked separate rather being as part of a whole. There were many remnants of former days as a multilingual site, a lot of latent vandalism (eg a number of pages still needing ass pus or still having been damonized), and serious difficulties navigating to find what books are actually worth reading. This, through the efforts of a number of editors, is improving (although I'm sure not as fast as we'd all like). 

There is still some way to go - personally I very much do see wikijunior and wikiversity as being part of the remit to host and develop textbooks, and I would love the rifts to disappear. The Cookbook namespace should disappear too. Hopefully making wikibooks look like something to be proud of will bring them into the fold. For me, we also need to resolve textbooks such as [[Knowing Knoppix]] and [[Gardening]], which have already been published, but which are clearly textbooks that would not be out of place here had they originally been started here. To my mind wikibooks is the wikimedia project you look at for textbooks (and if it isn't, it bloody well should be). They are not appropriate for wikisource (which does not appear to cover things even remotely looking like textbooks), yet provide a welcome addition to wikibooks.

Other issues to resolve are to make things more user-friendly. I have already changed the [[Wikibooks portal]] (along the lines of what is done for other wikimedia projects), though this probably deserves more work as it is the first thing many first-time visitors see. I have started to redraft the Help namespace content using modified wikipedia content - this too needs to be completed. The main page, no doubt, can be improved further.

In summary, there is much to be done to make wikibooks look like a good place to develop new textbooks - but that is the noble aim. If we can succeed, we can help bring down the cost of textbooks generally, which will greatly help education throughout the English-speaking world. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:21, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

== All cocktails articles disappearing ==
Hi, I've noticed that the wikibooks cocktails links are all going dead again.  It looks like you're combining all the cocktails into one enormous article.  I have about a dozen articles still in Transwiki: which I listed in your talk page a bit above, do you want to handle these or should I?  They are all for cocktails which had previously existing articles here, but they have substantially different content, and should be merged with or should replace the previously existing articles.  --[[User:Xyzzyplugh|Xyzzyplugh]] 00:32, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

:That's right. The Bartending book needs a bit of TLC at the moment - but I'm hoping that come June (or later) it will be a book of the month. This means some consolidation. As noted before, when linking to wikibooks, it's best to link through to the book title (ie to [[Bartending]]) rather than any of its subpages. That's because book structures change, sometimes dramatically, whereas book titles tend to be static, and then have redirects remain when they are moved. I'm happy clearing out anything in the Transwiki: pseudo-namespace if you want. Alternatively, feel free to add them direct to [[Bartending/Cocktails/Glossary]] and add the contributors to [[Bartending/Contributors]]. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:20, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

It's ok, nothing was really in it, and my thoughts have not been on this wiki stuff lately. I might recreate it later, but if it's NPOV, deleted or not is irrelevant, i'll just keep on recreating it.

== Speedy deleting [[Colonising Mars]] ==

Please don't!  If you really feel compelled to delete this module, please VfD this book.  Or at the very least nominate it for speedy deletion so a 2nd admin has the chance to review the idea.  I've expressed some grave concern that perhaps you are deleting too much content here on Wikibooks, and I think this has gone too far.

I know that you are trying to help clean up some older content that has needed to be removed, but you are starting to move into areas that I really don't think should be touched, at least without community concensus and not just the opinion of one lone user.  The weight of the world is not on your shoulders, and Wikibooks will do fine with even some of this cruft laying around for a little bit longer.  The ability to remove content from Wikibooks is not something to be taken casually, and can be abused.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:04, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

==Hit counters==

Is there any way that a Wikibooks hit counter can be used on a sampling basis? I know that hit counters were removed but what I had in mind was including Wikibooks counters on the first introduction page of a set of books (not the main page) for a week and then removing them so that we can gauge hit rates. This would not put excessive strain on the servers. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:09, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

I have re-opened this at the staff lounge. There seems to have been some confusion about whether or not the elevation to &quot;enforced&quot; was justified - perhaps the discussion can be re-opened for another week or two. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:45, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

please let me know if a discussion regarding the issue of contravention comes up. With a guillotine hanging over my head, I'm not spending any more time on it until the issue is resolved.
If it goes up for deletion, or etc, I pretty much only ask that i be given fair notice and time to move it.

Other than that, I'm twiddling my thumbs over here.

== Re: game guide transwikiing ==

I really see no problem in deleting pages that have been transwikied - to my mind, Jimbo's amendment to policy allows them to be deleted anyway as being outside the scope of Wikibooks (point 7 on the proposed [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]), although in practice they won't be deleted until they have been moved elsewhere. As far as the transwiki'ing point is concerned, point 4 on the proposed policy makes no references to the wiki being a WMF wiki.) I'd also be ok about allowing the book title page to contain a link through to the new location for a short while - a year, say.

Could I ask you, however, to expand on how the process of getting the games books over to StrategyWiki would work? I have a number of questions:
#When would it happen?
#How long would it take?
#How would we know what has been transwikied?
#How would we know what the entire contents of any one book has been transwikied? (at which point we can delete the book from wikibooks)
#How would we know what will be transwikied?
#What would happen if the authors of a book did not want it to go to StrategyWiki?
#Do you need help from Wikibookians, including Wikibooks admins, for the transwiki'ing to occur? If so, what?

All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:03, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

:Yeah I guess that's the best way to go about it, and since it's all official anyway no-one's likely to object. Anyway, here's the answers...
:# Pretty much any time. The only real concern is some books have had edits more recently than the last dump (April 21st I think). The more stagnant ones can be done straight away, but the rest will have to be done once the next dump surfaces (either that or merge the old dump with a current revision only dump, which may result in loss of some edits).
:# Not long. The tool does its thing (speed depending on both the dump's size and the computer) and then it's uploaded using [[Special:Upload]] over there. It doesn't take any more than a minute or two, but the larger books sometimes encounter errors during the transfer. However another thing to consider is fixing the book page naming. This is a lot easier to do via search-and-replace in the dump itself than with the move command. Same thing goes for the slash convention.
:# The books will be done on a per-book basis (although the biggest MMO books might require two or more parts, it will depend on WMDumper's speed/efficiency) so everything will be marked and/or deleted soon after.
:# I'll mark the book's main page appropriately, and either delete the rest of the pages myself or else leave a message on the main page about their deletion.
:# Check out [http://strategywiki.net/wiki/StrategyWiki:Wikibooks_Import_List#Excluded_from_importing this list] for exceptions. I haven't been through all the pages yet so there may be more.
:# Well, that's what the GFDL is for. Either they can extract their chosen pages from a Wikibooks dump (or the pages themselves, while they still remain) or else fork them from the StrategyWiki equivalent.
:# I don't think so, apart from deleting pages and things like that. Of course if you want to download a dump and jump on in feel free to. :)
:Anyway, I think that's it. Now that my broadband speed boost has finally kicked in I can get started on the unpopular guides... [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:25, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

==explain comment==

My comment to jguk is only stating that as long as there is a question
as to whether or not my effort on [[THINKSTARSHIP]] is in contravention, it seems irrational for me to continue that effort, until the issue of whether or not i am in contravention is resolved.
It is not a personal attack, only stating that i'd like to see the issue resolved, and explaining that it makes no sense for me to continue working until it is.

Hey Jguk me and [[User_talk:Dan131m#Templates|Dan131m]] have been discussing some things about the book, we'd like some more opinions on what to do about measurements in the book.

If that is the case here, please let me know and I will email you the text (as I have already done for KingKogs (see below)). As far as the [[Monopoly]] pages are concerned, I believe they will go in the near future too - it's only because that book is longer and is about a very familiar game that it has not yet been removed, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:34, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

I know this might be a little bit of a hot-button topic for you, but i figured i would say something anyway. The [[Wireless Internet]] book in it's new form looks promising, and (I feel) is suitable for wikibooks. Also, there are a number of stub books that can (and should) be merged into it, if we vote to keep it. If you feel like your original complaints have been satisfied, I would ask that you vote to '''keep''' those books. Looking through the VfD discussion, yours appears to be the only vote against. If you do decide to change your mind, we can move to end the vote early.

Great work so far. I hope the ones you have transferred to StrategyWiki are bedding down well. May I ask about the guides still listed at [[Wikibooks:Books possibly in contravention with WIW]]?

:Thank you for your interest in what I am doing. This was an example of being bold, rather than discussing first - although I have mooted the idea around without actually proposing it a number of times. I feel that these areas are part of the core areas Wikibooks should be addressing, along with Wikijunior and Wikiversity, which already have special &quot;sidebar&quot; status. Of course, Wikibooks should have textbooks that don't fit within any of those four descriptions too, and these can all be found through the bookshelves. I think the Wikistudy area - essentially a place for textbooks addressed at specific syllabuses on core school subjects - is a particularly important one. It is here that we have the most (as yet untapped) outside interest. I hope to assist in getting that interest turned into useful school textbooks both here at Wikibooks and through my work with Wikimedia UK. It is also the Wikistudy area that could make a real difference, especially given the high cost of purchasing copyrighted texts. I hope the future of Wikibooks has the Wikistudy concept as an excellent core which then spans out to cover textbooks on other areas, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:35, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

[[Image:Map_Minoan_Crete-en.svg|right|thumb|A map of the island of Crete]]

The Minoans lived on the island Crete, this was their main center. They also had control over Thera and Rhodes, two Greek islands, along with having had some control over the coast of Turkey.

==What did their structures look like?==

[[Image:Knossos bull.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Bull-jumping shown on a fresco]]

The Minoans built houses of stone and brick, but their most elaborate buildings were palaces and shrines of stone. Uniquely in the Mediterranean, the Minoans did not build defensive walls around their cities. Instead, their palaces had many open porches lined with red columns, and many windows to admit the Mediterranean sunlight. They adorned the edges of their roofs with curving ornaments that looked like bull's horns. Each of their palaces centered around a large open courtyard, where they held dances and athletic events. Many of the palace walls were covered with ''frescoes'', or paintings in which the paint is mixed with the plaster on the wall. Some frescoes showed men and women, ships, farmers, fishermen, dancers, nobles, and all sorts of people living very elegant, happy lives. Others showed dolphins leaping in the sea, or imaginary animals like griffins, which are half-lion and half-eagle. Many frescoes show a sport commonly known as &quot;bull-jumping&quot;, whereby the competitors would try to somersault over an angry bull as it charged around. Whether this practice was religious or a sport is unknown. Some people think it might be mythological and may have never happened at all.

==What did they eat?==

The island of Crete was rich in natural resources. They had access to wood, copper, farmland, stone and coastal areas. The Minoans were successful with farming and grew grain, herbs, olives and fruit. Much of the spare food was traded to make money for the island.

==What did their writing look like?==

[[File:Tablette lineaire-B.jpg|thumb|right|A tablet showing the Linear B writing system]]

The Minoans used a style of writing that scholars today call Linear A.  Towards the end of Minoan Civilization a new style of writing began to appear in Crete and elsewhere on mainland Greece. This was named Linear B. Unfortunately there are not enough examples of Linear A to enable us to decipher the script at present. Linear B, however, was deciphered in the 1950s by Michael Ventris who discovered that it was in fact a very early form of Ancient Greek, used at that time by the Mycenaeans. The presence of clay tablets with the Linear B script in Crete suggests the presence of Mycenaeans on the island during that last part of Minoan civilization, though it cannot be said with any certainty in what capacity they were present on the island. It is possible that after the collapse of Minoan civilization the Mycenaeans invaded Crete and took over the island.

The Minoans wrote their language on long, thin tablets of clay with a stylus or stick.  The writing has lots of different symbols, and scholars believe it is a type of writing called a ''syllabary'', in which one symbol stands for a consonant-vowel combination.  There are many Linear A symbols that may stand for whole words, though, because many of the tablets were found in storage rooms where the Minoans kept supplies of food, drink and equipment. The tablets which have come down to us exist because they were &quot;fired&quot; in the high temperatures created by the fires that destroyed the main palaces of Minoan Crete.

==What did they believe?==

Because no one knows how to read Linear A, no one knows exactly what the Minoans believed.  Because there are so many women in the frescoes on the walls of Minoan palaces, some people think that women ruled the Minoans.  It is possible that they worshipped a female god, because there are very few statues of male gods at Minoan archaeological sites, while there are a great many female goddess statues.  

One of the most common types of Minoan goddess statue is of a woman, wearing traditional Minoan clothing -- the skirt and bodice.  However, two snakes twine around her arms, and a bird of some sort perches on top of the crown on her head.  Some of these statues are made of pottery; others are made of ivory and gold.  They are found at a great many sites all around Crete and on some other Mediterranean islands.

Another god that the Minoans may have worshipped was a sea-god.  Many Minoan palaces are adorned with curving shapes of stone that look like the horns of a bull.  These horns may represent just the bull, but some scholars believe they mean more than that.  The Greeks told stories about a king of Crete who had a very dangerous monster with a bull's head trapped under his palace, and that the monster, called the Minotaur, regularly ate both men and women.  Scholars think this may have been a story about a Minoan god who accepted human sacrifices.

==What is their history?==

Small, basic tribes of people lived on the island from around 6000 BC. They lived this way for thousands of years, until in 2000 BC they rapidly advanced into the first civilization of Europe. The reason for this is not known, but some people think that Egyptians may have traveled to Crete and bought ideas and technology with them. The Minoans were successful because of their farming and fishing - they were not a military power. They also controlled the trade in the Aegean Sea and this made them very rich. Their navy was one of the strongest in the world and because of this they did not have to build walls or towers on their island. The Minoans suffered from natural disasters. The palace of Knossos was destroyed in 1700 BC and rebuilt. Around 1550 BC, the volcano Thera erupted and may have caused a tidal wave which devastated the coast of the Minoan kingdom. From then onwards, their control of trade weakened and they were not so successful. Many people believe that the Minoans were eventually invaded by barbarians who attacked mainland Greece first and then Crete itself. The civilization had died out by 1000 BC.

==Are some Cretans famous even today?==

There are two famous Minoans in mythology.  The first is ''King Minos'', from whom these people and their civilization are named by scholars today.  King Minos was believed to be a just and honest ruler, and the ancient Greeks believed that when he died, the king of the underworld made him a judge over the dead.  The second famous Minoan is ''Ariadne'', king Minos's daughter, who helped Theseus, a Greek hero, defeat and kill the Minotaur, and later became the wife of the god Dionysus.

=== Other Cretans ===

Minoan civilization was destroyed, and all signs of its culture largely vanished.  However, later centuries did produce some great minds.

''Gortyn'' was a lawmaker from Crete.  Though he lived after the destruction of Cretan civilization, he ordered his laws to be carved on a stone wall.  These laws still exist today, and they are one of the oldest examples of Greek writing in the world.

''Epimenides the Cretan'' was a philosopher from Crete.  He was the first to express what math teachers call the '''Epimenides Paradox'''.  His most significant achievement was this saying: &quot;all Cretans are liars.&quot;  Since he was a Cretan himself, he must have lied when he said that Cretans tell lies.  But that would mean that Cretans tell the truth.  However, if Cretans tell the truth, then Epamonides must have told the truth, which means that he (as well as all other Cretans) would be liars.  Mathematicians call this a ''strange loop'', because choosing one explanation of the statement means that you have to accept the opposite meaning immediately, circling around the question forever.

==What is left of them today?==

[[Image:Santorini Landsat.jpg|right|thumb|Thera was largely destroyed by the huge eruption of 1550 BC]]

In around 1550 BC, a volcano on the island of Thera ninety miles north of Crete erupted, and blew two-thirds of a whole island into ash and flying rock and hot gas.  The volcano caused an earthquake, which knocked down many buildings on Crete and killed many people.  Afterwards, a tidal wave rolled out from Thera, and washed several miles inland on Crete.  The palaces and other monuments of the Minoans were further damaged, many people died during the earthquake and the tidal wave, the Minoans themselves entered a period of decline.  

Sometime around 1480 BC, another Civilization from mainland Greece crossed the sea, and invaded Crete. The Minoans were still recovering from the Earthquake and tidal wave, they didn't know that another Civilization was coming to destroy them, they tried to defend the town but the army was still weak they failed, the other civilization conquered the ruined towns and built their own palaces to replace those destroyed in the earthquake and tidal wave.  They used the Minoan alphabet to write their own language, called Linear B, and took control of the Minoan towns, fields, and fishing grounds for themselves. Another theory is that the Minoans were not invaded until much later, and had continued to survive, despite not being as successful as before.

Although some of the people on Crete today might be descendants of the Minoans, the Minoan culture has vanished completely today. The legacy of Linear A, the writing system, has still not been translated and continues to be a mystery.

==Introduction==

Embrun, Ontario, Canada: A town of thousands of people. Many of those people know little about their town. Some of them don't even know the street names of many roads in the town, let alone the official flag of their municipality. In particular, many people of Embrun don't know much about their history. Many of them seem to know that 2006 is Embrun's sesquecentennial. The purpose of this WikiBook is to educate Embrunians about their history. I myself have searched high and mighty for webpages about Embrun's History. I have found a few scattered parts here and there, and now I put these together into one single reference that can be found easily.

==Saint Augustine-de-Catherine==

===A Brief Summary of Saint Augustine-de-Catherine===
In 1845, a small community called Saint Augustine-de-Catherine was founded as a lumber outpost. This new community was isolated for the first few years of its existence with boats the only means of traveling to and from the town. But bit by bit, the new community grew and it slowly started to connect with the outside world when a road was built from the town to Ottawa. It very slowly started to become self-sufficient. In 1856, the small village decided to change her name to Embrun. Read on to discover more about Saint Augustine-de-Catherine and how it started...

==Saint Augustine-de-Catherine: The Start of the Settlement==

===The Vision===
In May 1845, a group of 56 people in Montreal (although they were originally from the area of Joliette, Quebec) left the city by boat with hopes of establishing a new settlement somewhere in the Eastern portion of Canada West (now Ontario). Over the course of the next few decades, these people became known as the 'Founding 56'. They wanted to start a boomtown that would end up having thousands of people, with various neighborhoods and prosperous businesses.

Most of them were doubtful that their vision would ever come true. Little did they know that this vision was reality by the early 21st Century.

They had already planned out the settlement. They decided that lumbering could be the town's main industry. While a lumber town was not exactly what they wanted in the long run, they knew it would be the only industry they could set up right from the start.

They spent two months traveling on various rivers now part of Eastern Ontario, looking for suitable sites for settlement. They wanted a place that had so many trees that by the time the town ran out of trees, it could be strong enough to get another industry.

===The Start of the Settlement===
On August 24th, 1845, they found a good spot - along the north shore of the Castor River. This spot had numerous trees stretching as far as the eye could see, and already had a large clearing just a mile away from the river, just right for building a settlement in so they wouldn't have to worry about clearing an area in the dense forest.

There was also a clearing just by the shore. They decided to build a small dock in that clearing. This dock was completed in October. They made a rough dirt road from the dock to the inland clearing, where they started building about 15 log cabins. They also built a much larger log cabin that could be used for religious ceremonies and other community purposes. All of this was complete entirely by early December. By then, winter was on the way, so they moved into the cabins. They managed to find enough food to last the winter. In the spring, they started up the lumber industry. They decided to use the boat to export lumber to Hull. The town had began.

They named the town Saint Augustine-de-Catherine. The reason behind the name is not known, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Elephant and Camel Attack is a powerful attack that commits the two strongest pieces against the same enemy trap.  This attack is not frequently seen in practice due to the risk of a [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Camel_Hostage |Camel hostage]] and the unbalanced distribution of forces.  However, there are select situations where this attack can be used advantageously.

'''''Note: For simplicity, many examples below will assume that the Gold player is attacking the c6 trap.  Naturally, the same theories apply equally to attacks against all 4 traps.'''''

== Objectives ==

* Trap enemy pieces when the enemy Elephant is too far away to defend the trap.
* Create a wall with two strong pieces so that a Rabbit may be advanced along the outside.
* Distract the enemy Elephant from the opposite wing.
* Encourage a Camel hostage if the attacker believes the Camel hostage will be disadvantageous for the defender.
* Encourage a Camel hostage if the defender must lose piece(s) in order to take the hostage.
* Encourage a Camel hostage in order to attempt an [[Arimaa/Introduction_to_Strategy/Elephant_Blockade |Elephant blockade]].
* Encourage a Camel hostage with the intention of [[Arimaa/Multi-Piece_Swarming_Attacks |swarming]] the trap with small pieces and releasing the attacking Elephant.

Note that some of the strategic objectives above can be achieved with a Lone Camel Attack.

Without question, the largest risk associated with the Elephant and Camel Attack is the risk that the Camel will be taken hostage.  The defending Elephant often charges at an attacking Camel like a bull at a red cape.  A position may become strategically lost for the attacking player if the Camel is taken hostage, and therefore advancing the Camel into enemy territory is not a decision to be taken lightly.

| Diagram 1: Gold uses the two strongest pieces to open the path for a Rabbit advance
}}


In diagram 1 to the right, Gold has taken full advantage of the unfortunate position of the Silver Elephant, which is decentralized and far removed from the northwest quadrant of the board.  Seizing the opportunity to use an Elephant and Camel Attack, Gold has focused on pushing the Silver pieces east in order to clear a path for a Rabbit advance.  Although Silver can temporarily stop the Rabbit from scoring, Gold can easily control the c6 trap and gain a large material advantage, or perhaps continue to press for a quick goal.  As a general rule of thumb, it is preferable to place an attacking Elephant on d6 rather than c5 but the attacker should always consider the objectives in order to determine the optimal squares for the attacking pieces.  In this case, the Elephant and Camel do very well on c5 and c7 and Silver will have a difficult time moving defenders to the a and b files.  Note that if Gold did not have the Rabbit on a6, then Silver would be able to defend the position much more easily by playing a move such as rd6w dd3n md5n rd8w.  The threat of goal will force Silver to play a move such as rd8w ce7n ce8w rc8w, allowing Gold to control the c6 trap with Ec5w Eb5e rb6s Ra6e.

== Risks ==

* The Camel may be taken hostage.  This situation is covered in detail later in the chapter.
* The Camel may be framed.  This rarely occurs in practice and is not a disadvantage for the attacker if the Elephant is pinned to the d6 square.
* The Silver Elephant may stand on c5, stopping any trap threats from Gold’s two strongest pieces without decentralizing the Silver Elephant while also allowing the Silver Camel to operate on the opposite wing.
* Committing the two strongest pieces to the attack will leave Gold with weakened home traps.

|Gold controls the c6 trap by placing a Camel on b6 and an Elephant on d6.
}}

When attacking an enemy trap, a very effective plan is to place the Camel on b6 and the Elephant on d6.  The advantages of these squares are:
* if the enemy Elephant cannot reach c5 it is usually difficult for the defender to move a weaker piece to c5, making it problematic to defend the trap – even if a piece can reach c5 it may still be in danger of being pushed towards the c3 trap
* if the Camel is taken hostage it will be safe from the f6 trap and the enemy Elephant will become decentralized
* the Camel is located as far as possible from the enemy Elephant while still maintaining a convenient escape route along the ‘a’ or ‘b’ file
* a devastating Camel fork on d6 cannot occur while the Elephant occupies the square
* if the Silver Elephant is hostage-holding on the b6 square when the Gold Elephant occupies d6, the Silver Elephant cannot easily defended the f6 trap, if required 
* the defensive position becomes highly cramped

After the attacker has completely controlled the trap, the attacker may shift the Camel to the c7 square.  Some players even prefer to place the Camel on c7 at the very beginning of the attack, rather than on b6; both are effective strategies with the gold Elephant on d6.  From the c7 square, the Camel can repeatedly capture any piece that occupy the c8 square for goal defense.  If Silver abandons the c8 square, then Gold should advance a Rabbit toward the gap, if practicable to do so.  The drawback to placing a Gold Camel on c7 is that it becomes more difficult to flee if the Silver Elephant approaches c5.  

Sometimes a third attacker is advanced in order to secure the trap.  It is best to avoid calling up a Horse into the attack unless absolutely necessary as the Gold army will become unbalanced and the home traps may be seriously weakened and vulnerable.  Often a Rabbit is advanced along the outside either to assist in a potential escape, by unfreezing the Camel, or to create a goal threat in order to prevent a scattering by the defender.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Editing on the computer==
*'''Edit on the computer.''' Calculator editing of programs is extremely cumbersome, scrolling is slow, and program structure is hard to visualize. Also, calculators can lose power or freeze, which will destroy the current program and all other programs not archived. TI provides freely-downloadable &quot;Graph Link&quot; software, which is difficult to use, but is easier than manually programming on the calculator. It allows you to display messages in lowercase and write-protect programs. Unfortunately, the Windows version is not integrated into the [http://education.ti.com/educationportal/sites/US/productDetail/us_ti_connect.html TI Connect] software, which is necessary to transfer your programs to the calculator.
**Graph Link allows you to type strings with lowercase letters, which results in a better user interface.
**You can &quot;lock&quot; a program, which prevents display of the code on the calculator, so you (or your friend) cannot accidentally mess up the program.
**Fortunately, the Mac OS X version of TI Connect is much more powerful than its Windows counterpart, and allows for editing programs.

==Program Optimization==
This section assumes you already know TI-BASIC.

As in optimization with other program languages, most TI-BASIC programs can be optimized in two ways:  size optimization (makes the program take up less room on the calculator) and speed optimization (makes the program run faster). Often, improving the size of the program helps increase its speed and vice versa. Some basic tips that apply on BASIC programs follow:

*'''Learn more commands.''' TI graphing calculators have many commands built in. To access them go to the catalog. On the 83+/84+ the catalog can be displayed by pressing [2nd]+[CATALOG]. Some commands allow you to drastically shorten and speed up your TI-BASIC programs. For example, the abs( function automatically chops of the negative sign of a number. abs(-2) will return 2. This is faster and more compact then writing out if/then statements that chop off negative signs.
*'''Use Lbl/Goto Loops only when needed.''' Whenever you can, replace them with While, For( and other loops. This makes your code smaller, faster and a lot easier to read. Sometimes you absolutely need labels; do not be afraid to use them, but replace them whenever practical.
*'''Use text with the  Input function.''' You can place a single line of text after the input function using quotation marks. Follow this by a comma, then a variable. This saves you from having to use the Disp function and saves space. Ex. INPUT &quot;What number?&quot;,A
*'''Leave off ending quotes and parentheses.''' At the end of every line in a TI-BASIC program, the calculator does not care if you leave off your ending quote or your parenthesis. So, instead of typing   '':&quot;A+abs((2X+3)Y)&quot;'' you should type '':&quot;A+abs(Y(2X+3'' to save space. However, you should do this only when releasing a program (keep the original!) since it is more difficult to understand and edit. Not all commands or functions may allow this.
*'''Simplify Equations.''' This can be a more difficult task to one who is unfamiliar with equation manipulation learned from many algebra II classes. A smaller, more simplified equation usually can run faster and be smaller in size. It is an important note that parentheses also count as a single byte.
** &quot;(x + y) / z&quot; can be &quot;z^-1(x + y&quot;. This is because there is a &quot;^-1&quot; function right on the calculator that takes up a single byte, so in theory, you are saving your self a single byte by taking away a parenthesis.
**'''Find the formula.''' Using for loops can be messy and buggy. A formula needs to be run once while for loops can take ages to finish.
**'''Use constants that are available to you.''' Most should think this is a given, but due to the number of people I have seen using 3.14 for pi, this point should be brought up. Constants pi, e, and i are integrated into your calculator. Don't bother graphing using i, it usually won't work unless you change the mode to ax+i, but it usually isn't a good idea.
*'''Use as few variables as you can.''' Variables take up 18 bytes. If you use all 27 variables (not including available string and list spaces), this uses 486 bytes. This is sometimes more than the program itself. Simplify formulas as best you can. You can always use the Ans variable. Simply state the formula in your code without saving it into a variable. This puts the answer/result into the Ans variable itself. The Ans variable does not take up extra space because it always exists and always changes.
*'''Convert to assembly-language.''' &quot;Asm Programs&quot; can run ''much'' faster, but are harder to edit and thus are not suitable for short, simple programs.
*'''Use Subroutines.''' Often, in larger programs (on the scale of 5+ KB) there are repeating portions of the program (or very close bits). You can store these functions in a different program and have the original program call up the subroutine.
*'''Watch out for Stack Overflows.''' Any use of 'If-Then-Else', 'While', or other statements that are ended by 'End' causes the program to use some more memory, because it has to remember that that statement has to be closed by an 'End'. Avoid 'Goto'ing out of these blocks, or end them at your destination, otherwise if you do this often, you can get a Memory Error and you slow down your program fast.
*'''Make good use of the 'Ans' variable.''' Ans can store just about anything. If you have a big statement containing, say, 191 a number of times, you can do this: '191:(big statement)' and replace all 191 occurrences by 'Ans', which only takes up one byte, where 191 uses three. Be mindful of 'Ans' changing statements though.
*'''Don't run code you don't use.''' This is one optimization that can speed up your games tremendously. Instead of letting the program run through an entire for/while/repeat loop, you can end it prematurely with an if command: Simpy &quot;If (some code), End&quot; Meaning, if the condition is true, end the loop.
*'''Calculate positions at display.''' Instead of displaying text or a glyph for a program after its X,Y coordinates have been calculated, put the formulas where you would normally put the X,Y variables. For example, instead of going through a bunch of 'if' statements to find the string length of a number, you can use the log() operator inside your Output or Text commands to dynamically find its string length and display it at the correct position.
*'''Only clear what you need to.''' To save time for drawing graphics for games, don't use clear draw or clear home commands. The calculator takes a long time to clear the entire screen. Instead, you can output blank spaces to clear. For example, you have a symbol representing a spaceship. Instead of redrawing the whole screen when the spaceship's position changes, just draw blank spaces where its old position was and draw the new spaceship on top.
*'''Pause calculations using For().''' An easy workaround to pause the current state of your program for a small amount of time would be to use a blank For() loop. For example, to pause the game when a message pops up, simply code :For(Ans,1,30:End. Use this wisely, however, since it will pause all user input as well. (unless you put some code in the for loop)

Nearly always optimization requires creativity to be implemented properly and successfully.

==Tips==
If you must program on your calculator, there are several ways to make editing easier.
*'''Use CtlgHelp.''' Download and install the [http://education.ti.com/educationportal/downloadcenter/SoftwareDetail.do?website=US&amp;tabId=1&amp;appId=164 CtlgHelp] app on your calculator. (It requires 32 KB free space.) This app is a useful syntax reference. To access help, highlight a command in a menu or the Catalog and press the + key.
*'''Use a Plus Silver Edition calculator.''' If you can afford it, buy a &quot;Plus Silver Edition&quot; calculator, which is faster and has more memory.
*'''Backup your programs.''' When you finish writing or using a program, '''immediately''' &quot;archive&quot; it (this saves the program from RAM to an internal Flash disk). Programs which are archived will survive a power loss and most crashes, but those in RAM will disappear. This is only recommended if you only have to protect a single program. Use groups to backup multiple programs.  You may find CalcUtil useful because it will allow you to edit and run archived programs, thus protecting everything from accidental deletion ([http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/400/40029.html]).
**If your program saves permanent data, such as a notepad or to-do list, '''archive''' the file after reading or writing. The data file will thus be protected against power loss or crashes. However, this will significantly degrade performance, so it should not be used for large quantities of replaceable data that must be accessed quickly (such as a list of random numbers).
**Alternatively, you can back up multiple programs in one '''group''', which can be created in the memory menu. Groups must contain at least two objects (Programs or variables).

==Tricks==
*'''Make subroutines for complex tasks'''
**Make small programs that perform complex, repeated tasks. For example, suppose you have a program that performs a complex calculation multiple times. Instead of rewriting the complex calculation multiple times, write it once as a different program. Then, you can mention the program name in one line multiple times instead of writing out something long and complicated multiple times. The way to do this is to treat the separate program as a &quot;black box.&quot; The &quot;black box&quot; must manipulate values from the Ans variable. For example, consider these paired sets of code, which square a number twice and add one to it (prgmSQUARE does the repeated task of squaring the number):
 PRGM SQRPLS1
 :PROMPT A
 :A
 :prgmSQUARE
 :Ans
 :prgmSQUARE
 :Disp Ans+1

 PRGM SQUARE
 :Ans^2
*'''Copy-and-paste code'''
**Let's say you have a program with code you don't want to rewrite in your main program. First navigate to the place in your main program where you want to insert code. Then, press &quot;Insert&quot; on the keypad, and then &quot;Enter.&quot; Press &quot;Rcl,&quot; or &quot;Recall&quot; and then the &quot;PRGM&quot; button. Navigate to the name of the program containing the code you want to copy. Then, press &quot;Enter.&quot;
*'''Draw Fast Circles'''
**Insert a {i} parameter in your circle command; for example, this quickly draws a circle of radius 5 centered at (0,0):
 Circle(0,0,5,{i})

:Abbreviation for &quot;[[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|assume good faith]]&quot;, a guideline whereby one should not assume that an unwanted or disputed edit was done maliciously.
;anon{{anchor|anon}}
:Abbreviation for &quot;anonymous user&quot;. As a user does not necessarily lose his or her anonymity by registering or logging in, this term should be avoided. See '''[[#IP user|IP user]]'''.
;ArbCom, Arbcom, ARBCOM{{anchor|ArbCom|Arbcom|ARBCOM}}
:Abbreviation for [[Wikibooks:Arbitration Committee]], a proposal for [[Wikibooks:resolving disputes|resolving disputes]] which has failed to gain consensus.

;autoconfirm{{anchor|autoconfirm}}
:A newly registered user is still subject to some of the same restrictions as anonymous users—for example, inability to move pages or edit semi-protected pages. When a user is autoconfirmed, these restrictions end. Currently, a new user must wait four days to be autoconfirmed.

==B==
;ban{{anchor|ban}}
:Banning is the extreme, last resort action by which someone is prevented from editing Wikibooks for a prolonged or indeterminate length of time. Reason for banning is usually a long history of biased edits, persistent adding of incorrect or doubtful material, refusal to cooperate with others, or extreme incivility and threats. If someone is banned, their username is blocked, and any username or IP that is with great likelihood identified as being the same person can be blocked without any further reason. See also '''[[#block|block]]'''.
;blanking{{anchor|blanking}}
:Removing all content from a page. If blanking a page is done in bad faith, it is vandalism. If blanking is done to a vandalized brand-new page, {{tl|delete}} should be added to the blanked page to draw attention to it, rather than just blanking it. Newcomers often mistake blanking for deletion.
;block{{anchor|block}}
:Action by an administrator, removing from a certain IP address or username the ability to edit Wikibooks. Usually done against addresses that have done vandalism or against users who have been banned—see [[Wikibooks:Blocking policy]]. See also '''[[#ban|ban]]'''.
;blue link, bluelink{{anchor|blue link|bluelink}}

==C==
;canvassing{{anchor|canvassing}}
:Canvassing is sending messages to multiple '''[[#Wikibookian|Wikibookians]]''' with the intent to inform them about a community discussion. Under certain conditions, canvassing is acceptable to notify other editors of ongoing discussions, but inappropriate messages, written to influence the outcome rather than to improve the quality of a discussion, are considered disruptive since they compromise the consensus building process.
;cat, CAT{{anchor|cat|CAT}}
:&quot;Category&quot; or &quot;categorize&quot;. Often pluralized as &quot;cats&quot; or &quot;cats.&quot;  CAT used as an abbreviation for pages in the Category '''[[#namespace|namespace]]'''. See also '''[[#category|category]]'''.
;category{{anchor|category}}
:A category is a collection of pages automatically formed by the Wikibooks servers by analyzing category tags in pages. Category tags are in the form [[:Category:Computing]]. The part after the &quot;:&quot; is the name of the category. Adding a category tag causes a link to the category and any super-categories to be added to the bottom of the page. As stated, it also results in the page being added to the category listing. A list of basic categories to browse through can be found at [[:Category:Categories]].
;CC-BY-SA{{anchor|CC-BY-SA}}

Cleanup generally requires only editing skills, as opposed to the specialized knowledge that is more often called for by [[:Category:Pages needing attention|pages needing attention]].
;comment out{{anchor|comment out}}
:To hide information from normal display yet still retain the material for editors to see. This is done by inserting the characters &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!--&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the start of the comment text and &lt;nowiki&gt;--&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the end. These character strings are used to delimit comments in HTML code.

:Moving a page by taking the text of the page, and put it into the edit window for the second page. Generally considered worse than the 'move page' option, because it causes the page and its edit history to be in different places. Cut and paste moves can be fixed by administrators.

==D==
;data dump{{anchor|data dump}}
:To import material from outside sources into Wikibooks without editing, formatting, and linking. This is frowned upon by most Wikibookians, and is often a '''[[#copyvio|copyvio]]'''.

;double redirect{{anchor|double redirect}}
:A redirect which leads to another redirect. Counterintuitively, this will not bring one to the final destination, so it needs to be eliminated by linking directly to the target redirect. Double redirects are generated when moving a page that has redirects leading to it.
;dupe{{anchor|dupe}}
:Short for a duplicate page. Often used when identifying a duplicate page that needs to be '''[[#merge|merged]]''' with another.

==E==
;edit conflict{{anchor|edit conflict}}
:Appears if an edit is made to the page between when one opens it for editing and completes the edit. The later edit does not take effect, but the editor is prompted to merge their edit with the earlier one. Edit conflicts should not be confused with '''[[#edit war|edit wars]]'''.

In addition to the public sandbox, users may create private sandboxes on subpages of their user page.
;section editing{{anchor|section editing}}
:Using one of the '[edit]' links to the right of each section's title, one can get an edit window containing only the section of the page that's below the [edit] link. This makes it easier to find the exact spot where one wants to edit, and helps you avoid an '''[[#edit conflict|edit conflict]]'''. You can turn section editing off in your [[Special:Preferences|preferences]] under the &quot;Enable section editing via [edit] links&quot; option.

;top{{anchor|top}}
:On a user's list of contributions, '''(top)''' indicates that the page has not been edited by anyone else since the user last edited it.
;transclusion{{anchor|transclusion}}
:There are two main ways of using templates inside pages: transclusion (accomplished by using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Template Name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), and substitution (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template Name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). The former will include the content of ''Template Name'' on the fly whenever the page is loaded, while the latter will permanently insert the content of the template onto the page. Thus, using substitution, if the template content is modified at a later date, the page's content will ''not'' change.
:Substitution is the preferred method for long-term, permanent notices, as it creates a permanent record of the templates at the time and even helps to lighten the load on the database. Substitution has a further advantage in that a template may be de-linked from any associated category or slightly modified to suit the circumstances, for instance when the template is used on a talk page. Transclusion is preferred when it is possible that the template will be edited at a later date or when a list of pages including a template needs to be able to be generated.
;transwiki{{anchor|transwiki}}
:Move a page to another wiki.
;troll{{anchor|troll}}
:A user who incites or engages in disruptive behavior.  There are some people who just enjoy causing conflict, and there are those who make a hobby of it. However, these are few in number. Calling someone a troll in a dispute is a bad idea; it has an effect similar to calling someone a Nazi&amp;ndash;no further meaningful debate can be held.
;tweak{{anchor|tweak}}
:A small edit.

==U==
;user{{anchor|user}}
:See '''[[#editor|editor]]'''.
;userbox{{anchor|userbox}}
:A small box which is stored in the template space, and which includes a small piece of information about a user (such as &quot;This user likes cheese&quot;). Many users use userboxes on their user page, although some look down upon it. See also [[Wikibooks:Userboxes]].
;user page{{anchor|user page}}
A personal page for Wikibookians. Most people use their pages to introduce themselves and to keep various personal notes and lists. They are also used by Wikibookians to communicate with each other via the user talk pages.

;wall of text{{anchor|wall of text}}
:An unusually long paragraph, presenting a solid block of text of a dozen or more lines. Walls of text are visually unappealing and difficult to read.

==2000 Onward: Embrun in 2005==

In 2005, Embrun was a bedroom community. Most people in Embrun worked in Ottawa. Highway 417 provided two exits, 88 and 79, each at a seperate end of Embrun, which allowed citizens to get easy access to Ottawa. Embrun was still expanding in 2005. New streets and homes were being built in the Eastern parts of Embrun.

Also, businesses were now in large numbers. Restaurants, stores - Embrun had many business in 2005. Many of these businesses employed teenagers, senior citizens and students, a large part of the reason why Embrun isn't entirely a bedroom community.

However, in 2005, Embrun didn't have any true industry, and residential homes were still a huge majority of Embrun's buildings.

In 2005, a large Community Complex was planned. This community complex is still in the planning stage, however.

Embrun was definitely a boomtown in 2005. Embrun was confident as it left the sturdy grip of that year. And rightly so.

==Saint Augustine-de-Catherine: Life in Saint Augustine-de-Catherine from 1845-1848==

===The Lumber Industry===
The Lumber Industry was extremely dominant in Saint Augustine-de-Catherine from 1845-1848 and for many years after. Every day lumbermen would set out from their homes and chop trees near the settlement. These trees were loaded onto wheelbarrows. At the end of the day, the lumbermen would wheel the wood they chopped to the dock. At the dock, there was a huge room used for storing lumber. Every Tuesday boats would load as much lumber as they could as well as some people if they needed the transport and travel to Hull by way of the Castor River to the South Nation River to the Ottawa River. The journey was six and a half hours. Boats bound for Saint Augustine-de-Catherine would set out from Hull on Thursdays. Boats could not run during the Winter months, so lumbermen would stop working until Spring every winter.

===Floodwaters Reign===
Flooding became a problem in 1846, when the settlers experienced their first flood. So, they decided to expand the dock to a height of two stories. They placed an extra large window on the second story. There, boats would depart out of this window. The settlers built this in 1846 so that their lumber industry wouldn't have to stop for too long. Many people disagreed and said that it was a waste of time and money expanding the dock. However, each year these disagreements grew less and less common as the floods happened again in 1847 and 1848 and continued for years after. The floodwaters, however, didn't stretch far enough to reach the actual settlement, although in 1848 the extent of the floodwaters nearly reached the southernmost log cabin.

===Government===
Little is known about government administration of St. Augustine-de-Catherine during the 1845-1848 period, as Russell Township (where Embrun is situated) was not incorporated until 1854. During this time, the area was part of Ottawa District (which became Prescott-Russell County in 1849), which de jure would have administered Saint Augustine-de-Catherine prior to 1854. However, there are no references to any form of government in pre-1848 Saint Augustine-de-Catherine other than the citizen's council. Therefore, it is likely that although Ottawa District/Prescott-Russell had nominal authority, it was not exercised due to Saint Augustine-de-Catherine's remote location far from the rest of Ottawa District. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that government rule appeared to have strengthened after 1848 (when the road was built).

==Ingredients==

* Redgram ([[Cookbook:Toor dal|toor dal]]) - ½ cup
* [[Cookbook:Water|Water]] - 2 cups
* 2 handfuls of [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|methi leaves]] (Only the leaves without the tender stem)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1 big [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* Pinch of [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric powder]]
* One/Two [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|green chilli]], sliced
* 10 whole [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]].
* One small dollop of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* Small piece of [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] (if you like Ginger)

==Procedure==
Mix all above and put them in an Indian cooker ([[Cookbook:Pressure Cooking|pressure cooker]]).  Wait until the dal is cooked ( 4 whistles ).

Heat two spoons of [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]], and fry

* half small spoon of [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard seeds]]
* half small spoon of [[Cookbook:Cumin|zheera]] (cumin)
* two sliced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic cloves]]
* two [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|red chillis]]
* 6 to 8 [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|curry leaves]]

This takes less than 30 seconds to fry. Once garlic turns golden, add one small tomato finely chopped. Add salt, chilli powder to your taste.  Add  &quot;Coriander or Dhaniya powder&quot;. I would recommend this.  Add the above cooked Dal Mix to this fry, and  let it simmer. You can add water if you like it to be more like gravy. Add two drops of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] for added taste.

Eat this with hot rice, and an optional touch of Gongura pickle.

==Earth==

The Earth is the third planet from the sun and the largest terrestrial planet. A terrestrial planet is one that has a solid surface and is not primarily gas. It is also the fifth largest planet. The Earth is 149,600,000 kilometers from the sun, which is equal to one astronomical unit or AU. Unlike the other planets, Earth has an English name that is not derived from Greek or Roman mythology. Some other interesting facts about the Earth are that it is the densest major body in the solar system and it is between 4.5 and 4.6 billion years old. Every 500,000,000 years or so, the Earth’s crust is completely destroyed and recreated by plate tectonics and erosion. Seventy-one percent of the Earth is covered in water and it is the only planet where water exists in liquid form. The Earth has over 13,000 artificial satellites orbiting it. These are random facts about the Earth to give you a better picture of what our planet is like in comparison to the other planets. The rest of this chapter will discuss the physical makeup, atmosphere, and magnetic field of the Earth. We will also talk about the moon and why the Earth is habitable. 

==Physical Makeup==

The Earth is 12,742 kilometers in diameter and is made up primarily of rock and iron. However, its chemical composition is a little more complicated. By mass, the Earth is 34.6% iron, 29.5% oxygen, 15.2% silicon, 12.7% magnesium, 2.4% nickel, 1.9% sulfur, and .05% titanium. This seems like a long confusing list, but it just means that the chemical composition of the Earth is diverse. The makeup of Earth’s mass is simpler than the chemical composition. The Earth weighs 5.9736 x 1024kg, .023% of which is water. The rest of the mass, which is the majority, is in the mantle and the core. 

On the physical Earth, there are three main layers below the 1.4 x 1021kilogram ocean, the crust, the mantle, and the core. The crust is the outside of the Earth and is 0 to 40 kilometers thick. This is an average thickness, because the thickness varies around the Earth. For example, the crust is thinner under the ocean than under a continent. The crust is a solid layer of the Earth that weighs 2.6 x 1022kilograms. It made up of quartz and other silicates, feldspar for example. 
The mantle is below the crust and its total mass is 4.043 x 1024kilograms. The mantle is divided into four different layers: the upper mantle, transition region, lower mantle, and D layer. The upper mantle is obviously at the top of the mantle. It is 40 to 400 kilometers below the Earth’s surface and is semi-fluid. It is made up of olivine, pyroxene, calcium, and aluminum. Below the upper mantle is the transition region, which is 400 to 650 kilometers below the surface. Like the upper mantle, it is semi-fluid. Under the transition region is the lower mantle, which is begins 650 kilometers below the surface and goes to 2,700 kilometers below. Like the other two layers, it is semi-fluid. It is mostly silicon, magnesium, and oxygen with a little iron, calcium, and aluminum. Finally, the D layer is the last layer of the mantle and goes from 2,700 kilometers below the surface to 2,890 kilometers below. It is also semi-fluid. 

The final layer of the Earth is the core, which is below the mantle and the crust. It is mostly iron with temperatures as high as 7,500 Kelvin. These temperatures are hotter than the surface of the sun. The core is divided into two parts, the outer core and the inner core. The outer core goes from 2,890 kilometers below the surface to 5,150 kilometers. It is partially plastic and partially semi-fluid. It weighs 1.835 x 1024kilograms. The inner core is 5,150 to 6,378 kilometers below the surface of the Earth. It is the center most part of the Earth. It is completely solid and weighs 9.675 x 1022kilograms. 

==Atmosphere==

Other than the physical Earth, there is also an atmosphere and magnetic field. The atmosphere weighs 5.1 x 1018kilograms and is 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen. However, without photosynthesizing plants and algae to regenerate the oxygen, all of the oxygen would be gone within 5,000 years. Explain why. There are four main layers of the atmosphere, three of which we will discuss in detail. The four layers are the ionosphere, mesosphere, stratosphere, and troposphere. The troposphere is the region closest to the surface of the Earth and is where weather occurs. It is made up regions of rising and falling pockets of air. Air pressure at the top of this layer is only ten percent that of the pressure at sea level. Between the troposphere and the stratosphere is a buffer zone called the tropopause. The stratosphere is mostly made up of the ozone layer. In general, air flows horizontally in this area. In the ozone layer, there is a high concentration of ozone, hence its name. Ozone is a reactive form of oxygen. The ozone is responsible for absorbing the ultra-violet light radiation emitted by the sun. If this radiation reached the surface of the Earth, there would be devastating effects. The ozone layer could be depleting currently because of man-made carbon compounds. Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere. It is 50 to 85 kilometers above the surface of the Earth. Out of all of the layers of the atmosphere, the least is known about the mesosphere. Most meteors from space end up burning up in the mesosphere even though the top of the layer is the coldest part of Earth’s atmosphere. Satellites orbit above the mesosphere, while airplanes and weather balloons fly below it. Finally, there is the ionosphere also known as the thermosphere, which is very thin. In the ionosphere, atoms are ionized. This means that they gain or lose electrons so they no longer have an electric charge. The aurora also takes place in the ionosphere. The ionosphere is responsible for absorbing energetic photons from the sun and reflecting radio waves. Because this layer is so thin, its structure is influenced by charged particle wind from the sun also known as solar wind. 

==Magnetic Field==

Electric currents in the outer core produce the Earth’s magnetic field. Although we don’t completely understand the magnetic field, we do know that its origin is associated with electrical currents. These currents are produced by convective effects and the rotation called the dynamo effect in the spinning liquid metallic outer core. The magnetic field has a similar structure to that of a bar magnet with an axis that is tilted with respect to the rotation of the axis of the Earth. Currently, the geo-magnetic North Pole is located in northern Canada. The magnetic poles can move or reverse if there are irregularities. The magnetic field exerts forces on moving electrical charges. By doing this, it can trap charged particles like electrons and photons. The particles that are trapped are primarily from the solar wind. When they get trapped in the magnetic field, they create aurora. To trap the particles from the solar wind, the solar wind is deflected like water around the bow of the magnetic field. 

==Why is the Earth habitable?==

The Earth is a very unique planet because it has life. However, what makes the Earth habitable? There are four main reasons why the Earth is habitable. The first is the surface temperature and atmospheric pressure. Both of these things are just right so life can thrive and is protected without being frozen or burned. Secondly, the carbon cycle and photosynthesis are very important. In this process, plants remove carbon dioxide from the air and use it to form organic compounds. The compounds are then converted to oil, natural gases, or coal if the temperature and pressure conditions are correct. Much of the Earth’s carbon dioxide is below the ocean floor. It is released through heating processes like volcanism for example. The waste product of this entire system is oxygen. The third thing that makes Earth habitable is the oxygen. Oxygen is vital for life on Earth and its existence and creation by the carbon cycle are equally important. Finally, water is very important. We don’t only have ice, but also liquid water which is even more important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Good afternoon, and welcome to the page about me.

I am a novice programmer...

I guess that is pretty much simple and to the point.  I am a novice; I am learning.

I study whenever I am able, and eventually hope to have some level of skill.  For now, my contributions to programming related wiki books will mostly involve link corrections and minor newbie level details.  I am also good at understanding what is typed in most cases, so I may be of use in translating things into newbie friendly terms. =)

I have a blog at http://meyaden.blogspot.com/

I am new to blogging as well, but it could be a useful tool.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page presents a (comparatively) brief history of the development of reasoning techniques.

* 1) The history of the philosophy of reasoning follows definite cycles.

*2) Despite the complexity and capriciously fashionable  nature of this endeavor, particular tools of reasoning have developed and endured because they have been found to be reliable. 

Essentially, this Wikibook is about these &quot;tools of reasoning&quot; and their effective applications.

(Note: there are links at the bottom of this page to both the Great Books and Project Gutenberg sites which contain copies of the works of many of the people mentioned on this page. You may want to read what they actually said and that is certainly recommended for a fuller understanding of some of the different ways we can compile reliable data and make reasonable decisions.)
==The start of Reason==
Although very little was written about how we reason before the time of Plato, it is apparent that we did reason. The Egyptians had arithmetic and algebra by 4000 B.C. It is hard to imagine the engineering feats of the ancient world or the discovery of fundamental principles such as the Pythagorian theory without the aid of reason, but we turned to the introspection of the process of reasoning around the fifth century B.C.

And it is probably wrong to say that no one wrote about reasoning before Plato. It is simply a fact that none of the earlier writings survived (or have been found). For instance, although none of the writings of Heracleitus, who lived around 500 B.C., have been found, he was widely quoted (even by the founders of the Christian church) and fragments have survived. He was interested in the workings of the human mind. He was quoted as saying, &quot;Opposition brings men together, and out of discord comes the fairest harmony, and all things have their birth in strife.&quot; The creative capacity of conflict is still seen as a central tenet of reasoning theory and it is certainly central to processes such as dialectic and debate.

The study of reasoning was born from strife.
==The Bronze Age Thinkers==
The death of the tyrant Thrasybulus in 388 B.C. created a need for citizens of Greece to know how to conduct themselves in court so as to recover property that had been seized by the government during the Peloponnesian War. The Sophists, for a price, filled that need. They were itinerate teachers in Athens and the surrounding area who taught, among other things, rhetoric - the art of persuasive speaking. They were popularizers of existing knowledge. The Sophistic school had been founded as early as 450 B.C. Although there was a variety of positions held by the sophists, the hallmarks of sophistic philosophy was a thoroughgoing skepticism and realism. They tended toward moral relativism and taught practical subjects.

The early sophist, Protagoras, born around 480 B.C. taught that knowledge could only be the result of sense perceptions. He may have originated the idea that man is the measure of all things. He believed that the only reality there is, is that expressed by human individuals.

The younger Gordias (born around 425 B.C.) did not believe that people could obtain any certainty in any field because real things are different from our sensory impressions of them and it is too difficult to frame an exact verbal description of them.

Many of the works of Plato (c. 427 - 347) did survive and, although he did not write about the correct way to reason effectvely, he used his teacher, Socrates, to illustrate effective arguments. The general methods used by Socrates are called &quot;dialectic&quot;. Dialectic is the use of dialogue - questions and answers - as a means of intellectual investigation. Most of Plato's surviving works has Socrates as a foil for some popular philosophy, often propounded by a Sophist. His method was to ask leading questions which ultimately demonstrated the fallacy of the belief under investigation.

Whereas the Sophists often argued with the purpose of winning a case or beating an opponent, Plato demonstrated the use of argument as a method of discovering truth. Plato saw discussion as a way to clarify and organize thought.

Unlike Gordias, Plato believed that things could be known (see his &lt;i&gt;Theatetus&lt;/i&gt;) but, unlike Protagoras, Plato mistrusted sensory perceptions (see his &lt;i&gt;Meno&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Republic&lt;/i&gt;). He believed that what we see around us is not the Real but only shadow images of the actually Real (called &quot;forms&quot;). We attain true knowledge, not through our perception but through reason and the source of true knowledge is remembrances called up from our soul which extends far back before we were born. The soul is already in possession of knowledge.

Plato also recognised the importance of the imagination. He believed that it could replace reason when reason fails to supply the necessary connection between the ideal and the actual (see his &lt;i&gt;Timaeus&lt;/i&gt;).

Plato's student, Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), took a considerably different approach to philosophy. He was very interested in perception. He, in fact, wrote many books based on his observations of the world. He was also concerned with finding ways of making our perceptions more trustworthy. His ''Organum'', a set of works presenting his ideas on logic were the primary texts on the subject for centuries. His system of logic is still valid and represents the first formalization of the subject. Perhaps his greatest accomplishment was the extensive conceptual development of categorical logic and the syllogistic argument. 

Propositional logic, somewhat closer to modern logic than Aristotle's version, actually had a false start in the Megarian School founded by a student of Socrates, Euclid of Megara (~400 B.C.) - not to be confused with the more famous author of &lt;i&gt;The Elements&lt;/i&gt;.
==Iron Age Thinkers==
The study of logic progressed very little for almost 1000 years after Aristotle. A bright spot was Euclid who lived around 300 B.C. and developed the axiomatic approach to logic, especially as it concerned geometry and whose masterwork, ''Elements'', survives today.

The Romans were very practical people and focused on rhetoric. They were more intersested in means of influencing others than the pursuit of truth. The ideal of the learned man in the Roman world was the citizen-orator. Argumentation formed the basis of rhetoric.

Rhetoric was one of the major courses taught in the Roman and Medieval schools (the seven liberal arts were divided into two groups of subjects - the trivium (grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic) and the quadrivium (geometry, arihmetic, astronomy, and music)). Rhetoric was composed of invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. The first two were closely related to argumentation. 
==The Golden Age of Islam==
The Dark ages (around 450 ACE wrecked agriculture and stable economies, and allowed the hunters to prey on the civilized world. One of these marauding bands developed a vast empire which evolved into a highly cultured society, without whose academic excelence, all the work of the Greek and Roman world would have been lost in the mists of time.
 
During the Middle Ages, the dominant social and educational institution was religion: therefore, rhetoric became associated with preaching.

The Islamic age - 600 - 75o ACE bought reason to a very high standard. After the sack of Baghdad and  'reconquest' of Spain there was very little advance in the study of reasoning during the Middle Ages. An exception was the development of Supposition Theory, which was concerned with the semantic relationship between a term and its referent.

==Christian Universities==
Peter Abelard (1079-1142) revived human reason as an effective tool for the discovery of truth. A sharp dialectic practitioner, he effectively confronted the predominant Realism of the day and replaced it with his own Conceptualistic philosophy. Conceptualism (and the related Nominalism) rejected the reality of universals. Nominalists considered universals to be merely names; conceptualists believed them to be concepts, which were real, but only in the mind.

Roger Bacon (1214-1294) was an early pioneer of scientific inquiry, expanding the methods that lie at the heart of modern science - experimentation and induction.

William of Ockham (1280-1349) made some strides in logic and is most famous for his &quot;razor&quot; - his idea that an explanation should contain no more than is necessary to explain a phenomena. He also made some preiminary discoveries toward the development of DeMorgan's Laws and explored ternary (three state) logics.

Petrus Ramus (1515-1572) popularized &quot;everyday logic&quot;. He also introduced the convention of dividing the canons of rhetoric so that invention and arrangement were associated with philosophy. Thereafter, rhetoriticians were less involved with argument and more interested in style (gesture, delivery, figures of speech, etc.). 

==The Enlightenment==
Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) rejected Aristotolean logic and Scholasticism in favor of a new framework for discovery published in his Novum Organum in 1260. The new approach consisted of the careful observation and collection of data, their correct interpretation, and experimentation - in other words, modern science. 

The Port-Royal Logic was an important textbook of logic published anonymously in 1662 by Antoine Arnault and Pierre Nicole. It was written in the common language, contained many new notions, and was very popular.

The French matematician Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) probably contributed to the Port-Royal textbook. In response to a friend's question about gambling and in collaboration with Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665), he also developed probability theory which later gave birth to statistics. 

Since the time of René Descartes (1596-1650) until very recently, &quot;logic&quot; meant formal, symbolic logic. The Frenchman had an enomous impact on logic.

He instituted the idea of systematic doubt - doubt any idea that can be doubted. He searched for the basis of reasoning - that which could be accepted axiomatically, without doubt. He found one idea that met that criterion. &quot;I think, therefore, I am&quot; (&lt;i&gt;cogito ergo sum&lt;/i&gt;, which he wrote in French &lt;i&gt;je pense, donc je suis&lt;/i&gt;).

Thought is beyond doubt. Even if you doubt that you are, that doubt itself is thought. Even if you are an element in someone else's dream, you at least &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;. If you think, then you have some form of existence. One other thing is beyond doubt. There is other. Although the accuracy of sensory perception can be doubted, it is not totally under self's control, so there must be something else that is involved in sensation.

Everything else can be doubted. Sensations are unreliable. We often see things which are not and even more often erroneously interpret things that we sense. You may see a bug on the wall and find out, on closer inspection, that it's only a spot. A bag in the road is perceived as road kill. How often have we heard people say things that they did not actually say - remembered things that never happened?

For Decartes, revelation is also unreliable. How do we know that the divine knowledge that we receive is from God? It could be from some &quot;evil genius&quot; who only wishes to deceive us. 

Descartes inserted one other thing into logic - mathematics. He reasoned that God exists from a consideration of Euclid's exposition of geometry. He required that reasoning must proceed from unassailable axoims to conclusions. And then he translated position and motion into mathematical entities.

His rectilinear system of coordinates is named the Descartian system of coordinates in his honor. By setting up an arbitrary system of perpendicular axes, one can numerically describe the position of any point by reference to those axes. Analytical geometry is based on this concept. With Descarte began the notion that everything in the universe should be explainable formulaically. He wrote, in his &lt;i&gt;Discourse on Method&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;Give me extention and motion and I will construct the world.&quot;

These ideas were dominant in the sciences and in logic for the next 300 years. Reasoning became identified with formal logic. People began looking for ways to translate informal reasoning into formal logic and, thereby, to infuse reasoning with the certainty of formal thought. Science began looking for axoimatic bases for their investigations. Argumentation became the demonstration of self-evident proof.

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679), a contemporary of Descartes and Francis Bacon's last secretary, was the founder of scientific materialism and ethical hedonism. He believed that, once fundamental propositions are laid down, everything else follows deductively. &quot;All that exists is body [matter]; all that occurs is motion.&quot; Beyond that, we can know nothing about the external world through philosophical speculation. It could be real, but we have no way of finding it out or proving it. All we can know is what our senses tell us.

John Locke (1632-1704) believed that ideas are the products of experience and reflection on those experiences, in other words, reason.

Descartes reserved the self as the only defensible foundation for reason. Bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753) refuted that by showing that there were alternatives to Descartes' &quot;I&quot;, such as the mind of God. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) codified philosophical agnosticism in his &lt;i&gt;Critique of Pure Reason&lt;/i&gt;. He did maintain, however, that it is practical to assume that true knowledge of reality is available.

David Hume (1711-1776) proposed the most devastating attack on science up to his own time. Science relies on the fact that 1) nature is causative in essence (Things happen in an orderly sequence of causes and effects), 2) nature is uniform (Genralization relies on the belief that repeated observation of a particular event makes that event predictable), and 3) things are associated naturally on the basis of similarity, proximity, contrast, temporal association, etc.

Hume showed that:

1) Causation is not an element of nature but our way of making sense of patterns that we sense in the world. Those patterns are very much conditioned by our own mental fiters which are, in turn, conditioned by our culture, habits, memories, mind sets, etc. We cannot directly sense causality as such, therefore, our presumption of causality assumes that there are relationships involved that are not accessible to our senses.

2) The only way we can show that nature is uniform is by pointing out that it always has been, but that argument itself would presume the uniformity of nature. In other words, uniformity of nature can't be demonstrated without circular arguments.

3) The associations that we notice in nature are the result of the human mind's tendency to see order, even when it's not there. It is too easy to find instances where regularities are not really causal. For example, there are plenty of instances of drinkers of alcohol living to advanced age. That does not mean that drinking alcohol is good for you. 

Both Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1715) and Isaac Newton (1643-1727) developed calculus independently. It is Leibniz' notation that is in use today. He investigated the use of symbols and the relations of sets.

Newton developed many of the foundations of the scientific method.

Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) did extensive work in theoretical mathematics. In seeking to minimize errors in census data, he developed the method of least squares and the normal distribution, both central to modern statistics. He claimed to have discovered alternatives to Euclid's fifth axiom of geometry, thereby discovering non-Euclidean geometries, but he never published the ideas. His pupils, Georg Riemann (1826-1866) and Janos Bolyai (1802-1860) claimed the honor.

While Guass was developing the normal distribution, Simeon-Dennis Poisson (1781-1840) was developing the theory behind the probability distribution that was ultimately named after him, the Poisson distribution, which describes the probability of lightening strikes, arrival of customers at a checkout counter, and the chance of finding a particular number of predators in a large area of forest.
== Nineteenth Century==
Augustus DeMorgan (1806-1871) perfected mathematical induction and made many contributions to symbolic logic including the DeMorgan's laws which allows one to transform a conjunction into a disjunction or vice versa.

John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), in an attempt to provide a firm basis for scientific reasoning, formalised inductive logic in his book &lt;i&gt;A System of Logic&lt;/i&gt; (1843). His work in logic very much influenced later logicians such as Bertrand Russell (who was, by the way, his godson). 

George Boole (1815-1864) noticed a striking similarity between algebra and logic and developed a &quot;calculus of reasoning&quot; which was published in his &lt;i&gt;An Investigation of the Laws of Thought&lt;/i&gt;. It later bacame known as two-valued or Boolean algebra and became the basis, seventy years later, for the mathematics and logic used by digital computers.
==Twentieth Century==
John Venn (1834-1923) significantly extended Boole's logic and invented the Venn diagrams which make syllogistic logic so much easier to analyze.

Friedrich Frege (1848-1925) invented and axiomatized predicate logic. He was a major advocate of logicism, the position that arithmetic is reducible to logic.

In counterpoint to logicism, which held that logic was a means of discovering truth, two other conceptual frameworks arose around the turn of the cetury. Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer (1881-1966) held, what came to be known as Intuitionism, that mathematics and logic were not about truths (characteristics of reality), but were about mental consistencies. Internally consistent methods are used to manipulate simple concepts to realize more complex mental constructs.

David Hilbert (1862-1943) laid the groundwork for Formalism, the idea that mathematics is a meaningless exercise (a game) using symbols according to formal rules which are agreed to by consensus a priori.

Karl Pearson (1857-1936) was a prodigious inventor of statistical techniques. Among his inventions are linear regression, correlation, and the chi square test. He also unified many of the most useful probability distributions by showing that they were all members of a larger class of mathematical functions.

Sir Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) was another giant of modern statistics. He invented analysis of variance, maximum likelihood techniques, linear discrimination functions, and nonparametric procedures (the first was his randomization tests). He also did pioneer work in statistical information theory.

In 1910, Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) and Alfred Whitehead (1861-1947) published their &lt;i&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/i&gt; which outlined pretty much everything that had been produced in symbolic logic plus quite a lot of original material. In it, the authors proported to create an axiomatic system on which all of mathematics can be constructed. (Kurt Godel corrected that naivete a few years later.)

Rudolph Carnap (1891-1970) insisted that many of the questions addressed in philosophy were meaningless and amounted to an abuse of language. He was fascinated by the problem of formalizing semantics and developed a logical treatment of relations. He also did considerable early work in modal logics. He was a member of the Vienna Circle who institutes logical positivism which was the idea that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge. They held that a statement is meaningful only if it can be verified empirically.

Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) was not a logical positivist nor was he a member of the Vienna Circle, but he influenced them greatly and was on close terms with several of them. He is the inventor of the logical truth table. He believed that the world is compose of independent logical facts that constitute more complex facts.  

Albert Einstein (1879-1955) along with being an incredibly gifted physicist demonstrated that &quot;armchair experimentation&quot; (the use of mental exercises in developing theories) could be very productive for science. Much of his theories of relativity were developed outside the laboratory using such purely mental exercises.

Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) called Newtonian ideas about causation and predictability into question, especially on a subatomic level.

Karl Popper (1902-1994) repudiated the traditional observationist-inductivist position of science by proposing an alternative, empirical falsifiability criterion. In it, no statement (theory, hypothesis, proposition) should be considered scientific if it does not admit the possibility of a contrary statement.

Kurt Godel (1906-1978) proved the completeness of first order logics and the incompleteness of arithmetic. His proofs show that there is no set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics and not all mathematical questions are computable. Russell and Whitehead's dream of completely axiomatizing mathematics was ended forever.

Willard V. O, Quine (1908-2000) was a major factor in the decline of logical positivism. He effectively rejected the analytical-synthetic distinction so important in empirical orthodoxy and proposed ontological relativity. Analytical statements are those that are true or false by virtue of the meaning of the words used (e.g. &quot;A diamond is a gemstone&quot;). Synthetic statements are those that are true or false by virtue of facts about reality (i.e. The median age of Internet users is 25&quot;). According to ontological relativism, theories are not sufficiently determined by observed data and relies on other theories; no theory is complete in isolation. All theories are open to revision.

Quine also developed prime implicant theory that lead to the discovery by Edward J. McCluskey (1929- ) of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm for minimizing logical statements.

Although there had been some work done with modal logics since the time of Aristotle, the founder of modern modal logic was Clarence Lewis (1883-1964). Modal logics are systems for dealing with modalities such as possibility, necessity, and, by extension, similar concepts such as temporality, morality, supposition, etc. 

John Tukey (1915-2000) was one of the workhorses of modern Statistics turning out many invaluable procedures such as jackknife estimation, several methods of group comparison in analysis of variance, and exploratory data analysis (using many graphical procedures such as the boxplot). He also coined the terms &quot;bit&quot; (from &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt;inary dig&lt;b&gt;it&lt;/b&gt;) and &quot;software&quot;.

H. P. Grice (1915-1988) analyzed ordinary conversation and came up with the rules of language that are understood by participants in successful dialogues.

C. L. Hamblin (1922-1985) persuasively questioned the traditional fallacy classification by showing that &quot;fallacies&quot; are not always fallacious and must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Douglas Walton (1942- ) further clarified the situations in which classical fallacies may be valid arguments.

Chaim Perelman (1922-1984) introduced many concepts that are standard principles of modern rhetoric.

Maurice Karnaugh (1924- ) developed the Karnaugh map in 1950 that is used to simplify conjunctive or disjunctive logic and is used quite a lot in simplifying digital electronic circuit designs.

Chaos theory, developed in the late 1800s and through he 20th Century by scientists such as Henri Poincare (1854-1912), Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963), and Edward Lorenz (1917- ), demonstrated that there were processes in nature that could not be predicted to any fine degree of accuracy by any amount of calculaton or instrumentation. Weather is one of those phenomena. 

Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996) wrote very probing and influential works on the philosophy of science and asserted that science does not evolve gradually but progresses in jumps by undergoing occasional paradigm shifts.

Postmodernism, as a reaction to the modernism of the industrial revolution, was first recognized as a theoretical discipline in the 1970s. It held that meaning can only be experienced by individuals and can only be understood relative to the culture it came from. Experience is personal and cannot be generalized. Modern cultural, ethical, and religious relativism is an outgrowth of the potmodernist movement.

Stephen Toulmin (1922- ) held that formal logic is inappropriare as a model for argumentation. He developed a new and more adaptible model for nonformal reasoning. He also developed a way to diagram arguments widely in use today.

Rob Grootendorst (1943-2000) and Frans H. van Eemeren (1946- ) developed the pragma-dialectical model of argument analysis.

Michael Gilbert (1945- ) proposed a model in which argumentation is essentially a cooperative endeavor with the common goal of reaching the best possible conclusion/decision under the circumstances.

It is beneficial to note that Western logic which sprang primarily from ancient Greek philosophy is only one of three great systems of logic. Pretty much in isolation from the West, both India and China developed traditions of logic that differ in quite a few ways from Western logic. 

Recent popularizers of Eastern Philosophy such as Alan Watts, Benjamin Hoff, Paul Reps, and Thomas Cleary and the use of Oriental classics such as Laozi - &lt;i&gt;The Way&lt;/i&gt; (Tao Te), Myamoto Musachi - &lt;i&gt;The Book of Five Rings&lt;/i&gt;, and Sun Tzu - &lt;i&gt;The Art of War&lt;/i&gt; by business men and politicians have brought Eastern logic to the Western world.

Gotama (2nd century) can be called &quot;the Aristotle of India&quot;. Indian logic is derived from his works much in the same way that Western logic is derived from the works of Aristotle. His &lt;i&gt;Nyaya Sutras&lt;/i&gt; posit that there are four ways of knowing: percption, inference, comparison, and testimony and much of Nyayan logic are investigations of ways to make knowledge valid, since the followers of Nyaya believe that the only release from suffering is by obtaining valid knowledge.

The works of Genesa Upadhyaya (13th century) and the Navya-Nyaya school of Indian philosophy lead to refinements of Indian logic. Henry T. Colebrooke (&lt;i&gt;The Philosophy of the Hindus&lt;/i&gt;, 1824) investigated the Indian system of inference and concluded that it could not be accounted for by Aristotlean logic. It is possible that such logicians as Augustus DeMorgan and George Boole were influenced by Eastern logic.

A contemporary of Confucius, Mo Ti (470-391 BC), is credited with founding the Mohist school in China. They dealt with means of valid inference. Mohist logic was based on analogical instead of deductive reasoning. Chinese logic derived from reflections on the competing and controversial philosophies of Confucianism, Taoism, and Mohism.

Chinese logic was repressed by the Qin Dynasty (221 BC) and was replaced later by the introduction of Indian phlosophy with the influx of Buddhism into China in the 1st century AD.

&lt; [[History of Embrun/Under a new name/The Corporate Lumber Industry|'''Back to the Corporate Lumber Industry''']]

==Under a new name: Life in Embrun in 1883==

3 schoolhouses existed in Embrun in 1883. The town's population was 3,300 in 1883.

===The new industry===
[[File:LeVillageNewspaper.jpg|450px|thumb|Photo of the remains of a copy of Le Village Newspaper's August 27th, 1883 edition, with the headline being about a predicted successful harvest.]]
Now, flour and bread production was Embrun's main industry. A few hundred people in Embrun moved north or south to the areas that were formerly forests cut down by the Lumber companies. There, they started huge farms of wheat as far as the eye could see. These people, however, were still considered part of Embrun and were still counted as part of Embrun's population. These people that moved out of the main built-up area were nicknamed 'bulk growers' in the sense that they had large fields of wheat.

Some people in Embrun bought huge grants of land to the north or south, but still lived in their homes in the village itself. These people travelled every so often to their fields to tend their wheat plants. These people were nicknamed, 'bulk travelers' because they grew lots of wheat but still lived in the village.

However, the majority of Embrun's population lived in the village and grew crops in their yards. Each household in Embrun had a fairly large backyard. These people were named 'house growers' in the sense that they grew their crops in their backyards.

These three wheat growing methods and their nicknames were fully developed by 1883.

The 1883 harvest was very successful. Originally, people in Embrun would export their wheat as a raw product, but the harvest was so huge in 1883 that three flour mills were hastily built on the shores of the Castor River. The water was used to power the mills. The grain was turned into flour. A few residents of Embrun who didn't like farming formed an extra large bakery. They turned the flour into bread there that year. Then, the bread was exported to make money.

===Getting To and From Embrun in 1883===
The main way of getting to and from Embrun in 1883 was by road. Despite the prosperity of the town, no railroad (yet) traveled into Embrun. In the fall of 1883, huge cart after huge cart left the town by road, bound for the cities to sell the grain.

==Ingredients==
*9[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (250g) gingernut (or [[Cookbook:Digestive Biscuit|digestive]]) biscuits
*10[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (275g) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] 
*1 tin (400g) [[Cookbook:Sweetened Condensed Milk|sweetened condensed milk]]
*6[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (175g) [[Cookbook:Caster Sugar|caster sugar]]
*1/4 pint (150[[Cookbook:mL|ml]]) [[Cookbook:Double Cream|double cream]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]]

==Procedure==
To make the base, crush the biscuits into crumbs with the end of a [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] -- this is best done inside a freezer bag to avoid spillage and loss. Melt two-fifths of the butter (about 4oz) in a large saucepan. Once melted, take off the heat add mix in the biscuit crumbs. Press into the bottom of an 8-inch (20cm) loose-bottomed tin, and transfer to a fridge to chill.

For the filling, place the remaining butter with the sugar into a medium-sized saucepan (ideally non-stick if you don't like dish washing) and melt over a medium heat, stirring until the butter has melted, and sugar is just starting to melt. Add the condensed milk and bring to the boil, stirring continuously for 5 minutes to make your caramel.

To assemble, chop the bananas into slices, arrange over the base, and pour the caramel over the top, before returning to chill for at least an hour for the caramel to firm.

Prior to serving, whip the cream, and spoon over the top, optionally with some grated chocolate, or garnish with [[Cookbook:Cape Gooseberry|Cape gooseberries]].

==Warnings==
*One pie may not be enough...
*If there are children present, it is practically impossible to keep them from licking the contents of the condensed milk tin! Be careful of the edges.

== Lip-Sync with Shape Keys == 
Here I will attempt to explain my recent dealings with using Blender Shape Keys to produce convincing lip-sync (Lip-synchronisation, i.e.: &quot;speech&quot;) for simple, humanoid characters.

This is aimed at people with an understanding of Blender fundamentals like ''vertex loops'', ''face loops'', ''sequencer'' and of course, Blender's new ''Shape Key'' system. If these terms mean nothing to you, then you may well struggle to keep up. If you're familiar with them then I hope this tutorial will prove to be a breeze and your characters will be speaking so fluently you'll have trouble shutting them up!

Other Lip-sync tutorials, if you can find them, recommend using other software like Magpie, Papagayo and others but while I've no doubt they provide a valuable service and maybe make syncing easier, I will be using only Blender for this tutorial. I haven't tried using lip-sync software yet so I can't really say if it's easier or not.

You will find links to interesting audio files you can use for testing animation and lip-sync near the bottom of the page.

== The hard work first ==

=== Setting up for Lip-Sync ===
First, set up your Blender screen so you have everything you need for this project. You'll need a front 3D Window, an Action Window, the Buttons Window (showing Editing - F9 - panels) and a Timeline Window. If you've got the room, a Side-view 3D Window would be handy too.

The basic sound units are called '''phonemes''' and the mouth shapes we use to represent these phonemes for lip-sync are called '''visemes''' ''(or sometimes, phoneme shapes)'' and there are many references for these around the web. Legendary animator Preston Blair created one of the [http://www.garycmartin.com/mouth_shapes.html most popular viseme sets], which is great for cartoon-style characters. Other visemes are aimed at more-realist, humanoid characters. The shapes you choose depend on the style of your model. ''(I'll try to provide some useful links later)''

[[Image:SyncSample.jpg|Sample phoneme shapes]]&lt;br&gt;
''Sample viseme shapes.''

The first and most difficult step in good lip-sync is making the shape keys for these visemes. How well these are made ultimately determines the success of the animation and it is worth spending time getting them right, although they can be modified and tweaked later. So choose your favourite set of visemes ''(or even look in a mirror and use your own face as a reference)'' and start setting your keys. A model with good '''topology''' - especially well formed '''edge loops''' around the mouth area - will be a big help here!

==== What on Earth are topology and edge loops?!?! ====

Topology refers to the way your 3D mesh defines the object, in this case your character's head. Edge loops refers to the flow of consecutive edges around the character's major features. Typically, good edge loops flow around the eyes and around the mouth in a somewhat deformed, &quot;circular&quot; manner. Selecting and deforming a single loop of edges and vertices surrounding a facial feature is much quicker than having to individually select a lot of edges that don't flow naturally around that feature. Similarly, deforming a single loop or collection of related, nested loops is much easier and quicker than trying to deform a seemingly random set of edges. You can easily see these loops in the character screenshots above. The series of edges surrounding the mouth simply stretch from wide ellipses to almost circular to create a useful variety of mouth shapes. The faces defined by paired edge loops are referred to as '''face loops'''. The close-up image below shows selected face loops. 

There are many tutorials on the web about these topics so if you need more information before proceeding then a quick search is probably a good idea.

==== Setting the basic viseme shape keys ====
First, select your undeformed mesh and create your basis key. Go to '''Editing''' (F9) window and go to the &quot;'''Shapes'''&quot; panel. Press the &quot;'''Add Shape Key'''&quot; button. Enter and exit edit mode to set the basis key. Then create your first key '''Key 1''' and name it &quot;M&quot;. Enter edit mode and if your character's mouth isn't already closed ''(some people make them that way)'' then close it by carefully selecting the faces and loops around the mouth. You will usually use Size-Z plus a bit of grabbing and shifting to achieve this. Don't forget to include the faces on the inside of the lips or the deformation will be unpleasant. When you're happy with the shape, exit Edit mode and there you have it. Your character can now say ''&quot;Mmmmmm&quot;'' whenever you like. Test it by moving the Shape Key slider back and forth but make sure to leave it at zero before making more keys. ''(If you made your character with a closed mouth then you can just add the new &quot;M&quot; key then enter and exit edit mode to set it.)''

[[Image:SyncLoops.jpg|Selecting face loops]]&lt;br&gt;
''Selecting face loops''

For most new keys, you will select the basis key first then press &quot;'''Add Shape Key'''&quot; then make the required shape from scratch in edit mode. However, some mouth shapes are very similar, like &quot;OH and OOO&quot; or &quot;EE and SS&quot; and it would be easier if you could start with something close to what you want rather than shifting everything from scratch every time. Luckily, Blender allows you to do just this. Once you've made your &quot;EE&quot; key, for example, you can select it and immediately press &quot;'''Add Shape Key'''&quot; then enter edit mode and the mouth will already be deformed and you only need to make subtle changes to it to make your &quot;S&quot; shape.

'''Remember that the keys you make are for sounds, not letters. &lt;br&gt;
In general, you'll need shape keys for the following sounds'''
* '''M, B, P'''
* '''EEE''' ''(long &quot;E&quot; sound as in &quot;Sheep&quot;)''
* '''Err''' ''(As in &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Fur&quot;, Long-er&quot; - also covers phonemes like &quot;H&quot; in &quot;Hello&quot;)''
* '''Eye, Ay''' ''(As in &quot;Fly&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;)''
* '''i''' ''(Short &quot;I&quot; as in &quot;it&quot;, &quot;Fit&quot;)''
* '''Oh''' ''(As in &quot;Slow&quot;)'' 
* '''OOO, W''' ''(As in &quot;Moo&quot; and &quot;Went&quot;)''
* '''Y, Ch, J''' ''(&quot;You, Chew, Jalopy&quot;)''
* '''F, V''' 

These can often be used in combination with each other and with jaw bone rotations and tongue actions to also produce other sounds like &quot;S&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Th&quot; and a short &quot;O&quot; as in &quot;Hot&quot; - or these can also be specifically made with their own shapes. This decision depends largely on your character. Start with the essentials and make others if you need them.

'''NOTE:''' I use one jawbone in my current character and this is also used to control the mouth shapes. It doesn't drive the shapes but it moves the bottom teeth and tongue ''(which can also be controlled separately)'' and the faces that make up the chin part of the character mesh. For some visemes, I move the jawbone into a logical position before adding the shape key. For example. I open the jaw for the &quot;OH&quot; key and close it for the &quot;M&quot; key. Later, when animating, the jawbone is animated along with the Shapes for a very convincing result.

[[Image:SyncJaw.jpg|Using jawbone with shapes]]&lt;br&gt;
''Using jawbone with shapes''

==== Load the audio ====
Once all your viseme shapes are set the time comes to get your character to speak. ''(Normally you would animate the body first and leave the lip-sync till near the end)''.

If you haven't already done so, load your audio file into a Blender '''Video Sequencer Window''' and position it where you want it. Currently, Blender only supports 16 bit wav format audio files so you may need some editing or conversion software to process the file if it isn't in this format. &quot;Audacity&quot; is a good, open-source (free) editor that will suit this purpose and much more.

[[Image:SyncSeqEditor.png|Blender Soundblock Panel]]&lt;br&gt;
''Blender Video Sequence Editor Window showing loaded Audio Strip''


Go to the Scene Window (F10) and press the &quot;Sound block buttons&quot; button --(in the three buttons near the frame counter. It looks like an audio wave)--. Press the &quot;'''Sync'''&quot; and &quot;'''Scrub'''&quot; buttons. The &quot;'''Sync'''&quot; button makes the playback in the 3D window closely match the audio when you press '''Alt-A''' ''(it does this by dropping image frames if necessary and it generally provides only a rough guide of how things match-up)''. The &quot;'''Scrub'''&quot; button is important for lip-sync as it means that whenever you change frames, Blender plays the audio at that point ''(Currently in some Blender builds you have to press Alt-A at least once to get this feature to start working)''.

[[Image:SyncSoundblock.png|Blender Soundblock Panel]]&lt;br&gt;
''Blender Soundblock Panel''

Select your character and your Shape Keys should be listed in the '''Action Window''', in the order in which you made them ''(I don't think they can be shuffled)''. You will see a small triangle button labelled &quot;'''Sliders'''&quot; at the top of the list - press it to show the sliders for each shape. If you drag the mouse back and forth in this window, you should hear the audio play as you cross frames. This is how you will identify the main viseme/phoneme key frames.

[[Image:SyncSliders.png|Shape Key Sliders]]&lt;br&gt;
''Shape Key Sliders''

== Getting down and dirty ==
Before you begin your lip-sync, you obviously need to know what your character says. It might be worthwhile writing it down and even speaking it over and over, in time with the audio, to get a feeling for the sounds you'll be dealing with. Some sounds are what I'll call &quot;'''key sounds'''&quot; and others are almost dead, non-descript &quot;in-between&quot; sounds that fill in the gaps between the key sounds. Obvious key sounds are those where the lips close and those where they are tightly pursed or wide and round, other key sounds can differ with every piece of audio. Don't make assumptions about the shapes you'll use based on the words you know are there. What you are animating are the actual sounds - not letters or words (''Keith Lango has much to say about this on his website and I recommend reading it'')

=== The Timeline Window ===
Go to the '''Timeline Window'''. This window seems to have been largely overlooked in previous documentation yet it provides the basics for timed animation plus a few other goodies to make your animation life a little easier. Here you can turn auto-keying on and off at will ''(you'd normally go to the hidden '''User Preferences''' window which is a pain and easy to forget)'', navigate frames, play and pause the animation in the 3D window, turn Audio Sync on and off, set the start and end frames for the animation and '''set frame markers'''. This last feature is the key to our project.

In recent Blender releases,the audio &quot;Scrub&quot; feature works in most windows. As you  scrub through the audio, listen for where the key sounds occur. As you hit a key sound, scrub back and forth to find where that sound commences. In the Timeline Window, press &quot;'''M'''&quot; to set a frame marker at this frame. The marker can be labelled by pressing CTRL-M in the Timeline Window while the marker is selected ''(yellow)''. Enter a sensible name for the marker that indicates what the marker is for (''like the phoneme sound and/or which word it starts or ends''). Markers are selectable and moveable and can be deleted just like other Blender items.

'''NOTE:''' Depending on the speed of your system, you may find you get more pleasing audio scrubbing and better 3D window playback if you turn off subsurf for your model and hide any unimportant parts of the scene on different layers. The fewer things Blender has to calculate as you scrub or play-back, the faster it can draw the frames to maintain sync with the audio.

[[Image:SyncSubSurf.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;
''Turn off these buttons to disable subsurf setting in 3D window''


[[Image:SyncTimeline.png|Timeline Window]]&lt;br&gt;
''Blender Timeline Window''

Scrub through the whole audio - or sections of it in a long piece - marking and labelling all the key sounds.

=== Setting the keys ===
Now you have everything you need for your first lip-sync pass. Start at the first frame and click once on all your '''Shape Key sliders''' in the Action Window to '''set them all to zero'''. Move through the frames from start to finish setting shape keys where you marked the key sounds in the Timeline Window. If your character has a jaw bone and tongue bone(s), you will need to set these where required as you go.

==== Trouble in paradise? A quick lesson in handling Shape Keys ====
If you haven't set shape keys before you might notice one interesting dilemma - they have great memories! Once you set a slider to any value, it stays at that value until you set another value somewhere. The shapes change in a linear fashion between keys. At first, this appears to be a problem if you want to key &quot;MOO&quot; because after you set the &quot;M&quot; key slider to 1 (one), it will stay there, making it impossible to get your character to say &quot;OO&quot; while his lips are trying to stay shut. So, you have to set the &quot;M&quot; slider on the &quot;M&quot; sound, then as the audio goes into the &quot;OO&quot; sound, you must set the &quot;M&quot; slider back to zero and then set the &quot;OO&quot; slider to its full value.

This introduces another problem. After you set the &quot;OO&quot; key, your &quot;M&quot; sound is messed up because the mouth is now also being affected by the &quot;OO&quot; shape that follows it. So, you must make sure the &quot;OO&quot; sound is set to zero when you want the lips closed in the &quot;M&quot; position.

'''In general, you'll find yourself setting each shape 3 times''' 
* once to determine where you want the mouth to begin moving to this shape ''(slider set to zero)''
* once to set the slider at the desired level for this phoneme
* and once more to end this shape and move into the next one ''(slider set to zero)''
''The same principle applies to the jaw bone and tongue - 3 keys to each move.''

[[Image:SyncSliderKeys.png|Varying shape key settings]]&lt;br&gt;
''Setting multiple shape keys''

As you get more comfortable with this procedure, you'll find you can leave some shapes set longer or adjust them to different levels as they can provide some interesting mouth shapes when combined with other shapes.

=== Setting the in-between sounds ===
Once the key sounds are properly set, you should be able to scrub slowly through the Action Window and watch your character speak in time with the audio. It won't be perfect but it's a start. To fix his speech impediment, you now have to fill in the sounds between the key sounds. Mostly these will be dull vowel sounds ''(&quot;err, uh, ah&quot;)'' and silence. These shapes are set in exactly the same way but here you'll have to really watch the 3D view as you set the sliders. Try combinations of sliders like &quot;EE&quot; and &quot;OH&quot; to get the perfect shape for each individual sound. You have to be guided by your character. Does he look like he's saying the sound you're hearing? ''(Remember that exactly what's being said is not important - it's only the sound that matters)''. Test each sound as you set it by scrubbing a few frames over and over and watching your character mouth the sounds.

All that's left, hopefully, is some polishing and tweaking. If it's not perfect then don't despair. Like other areas of animation, it can take a while to get a feeling for lip-sync and as the tools and workflow become more familiar you can pay more attention to the important work.

== Putting it all together ==
Once you're reasonably happy, it's time to combine the audio and video and watch the result. Since Blender can't do muxing (combined audio/video) you'll need to composite it with the editing software of your choice (OSX users can use recent versions of iMovie, virtualDub is often recommended for Windows users and Avidemux2 is often recommended for Linux users.). 

What Blender can do is provide a '''fully synced''' version of the audio file the same length as the animation - even adding silence at the start and end if need be to maintain the synchronisation. To make this synced audio file, go back to the &quot;Sound block buttons&quot; panel and press &quot;'''MIXDOWN'''&quot;. This saves a .wav file using the filename and location you entered in your output box ''(you did didn't you?)'' plus a frame count ''(something like 'speech.avi0001_0400.wav')''. Then save your animation by pressing the &quot;'''ANIM'''&quot; button.

Combine the audio and video in your video editor and export a muxed file. You may find when you play it back that the mouth seems to be just slightly out of sync. This is for two reasons: sound travels much slower than light, so we see the lips move before the sound reaches our ears, and the lag is more the further away the person is (about 3 milliseconds of delay for every metre), and the more exaggerated their expressions as they shout. The second reason is the way the brain processes faces and expressions and mixes it with sounds heard to comprehend speech. This comprehension phenomenon is barely understood and is a common challenge in animation, and some physiologists think our brains read lips and facial expression as a way of setting up to understand the context of sounds received and comprehending the meaning behind language. To solve it, you can go back into Blender, select the audio in the Sequencer Window and move it one or two frames later, then press &quot;MIXDOWN&quot; again to create a new .wav file with a split second of silence at the start. Remix this with your video and watch the results.

From here on its all a matter of testing and tweaking until you're happy!

== Using Blender to render Audio AND Video TOGETHER. ==
Ever since Blender 2.3, it has been possible to render video with the audio attached.  Once you have your animation done, and are ready to render:  In the buttons window, click scene (F10).  In the format tab, choose FFMpeg.  There will now be three tabs.  Click on Audio.  Click Multiplex, and choose your audio codec.  Click Video.  Choose your video codec (including AVI).  Now, in another section of the window, there will be an Anim tab.  Click Do Sequence.  And click ANIM.  When you watch the video, you'll notice that it has sound.

Note:  The mac version of blender doesn't have the FFMpeg codec in blender by default.

== Audio Files ==
You can find some interesting audio files selected for animators at [http://www.animationmeat.com/practice/practice.html]animationmeat. These files come complete with a pre-marked phoneme sheet.

== P.S. ==
One final note. Watch how the pros do this. When actors are doing voice overs for major releases their actions are recorded and even integrated into the final animation. If you have a digital camera, you may also try recording your own mouth performing your dialogue and approximating its positions to your animation. This can give you a great visual reference, possibly frames for frames if your frame rates match, and save you time.

The '''United States Constitution''' is the supreme law of the United States of America. When nine states of the then thirteen states ratified the document it marked the creation of a union of sovereign states, and a federal government to operate that union. It replaced the weaker, less well-defined union that existed under the [[../Articles of Confederation/]] and took effect on March 4, 1789. The handwritten copy signed by the delegates to the Congress is on display in the [[../National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in Washington, D.C. It is the second of the three Charters of Freedom along with the [[../Declaration of Independence/]] and the [[../Bill of Rights/]].

==Background==
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress being its only component—under the [[../|Articles of Confederation/]]. Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts. It also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states. The Articles required unanimous consent from all the states before they could be amended and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent. For lack of a quorum, Congress was frequently blocked from making even moderate changes.

The Confederation Congress endorsed the plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on February 21, 1787. Twelve states, Rhode Island being the only exception, accepted this invitation and sent delegates to convene in May 1787. The decision was made to draft a new fundamental government design which eventually stipulated that only 9 of the 13 states would have to ratify for the new government to go into effect. These actions were criticized by some as exceeding the convention's mandate and existing law. However, Congress, noting dissatisfaction with the Articles of Confederation government, unanimously agreed to submit the proposal to the states despite what some perceived as the exceeded terms of reference. On September 17, 1787, the Constitution was completed in Philadelphia, followed by a speech given by Benjamin Franklin. In it he talked about how he wasn't completely satisfied with it but that perfection would never fully be achieved. He accepted the document as it was and he wanted all those against the ratification of it to do the same. The new government it prescribed came into existence on March 4, 1789, after fierce fights over ratification in many of the states.

==Text of the Constitution==
The text of the Constitution can be divided into nine sections: the preamble, 7 articles, and the conclusion. (Note that the preamble and conclusion headings are not part of the text of the document) (though the articles have headings labeled Article I-Article VII).

===Preamble===
''We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.''

The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.

The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.''

''No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.''

''The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.''

''The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.''

''The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.''

''Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.''

If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by Yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.''

''Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.''

====Section 1====
''The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice-President chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:''

''Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.''

''The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not lie an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; a quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two-thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice-President.''

''The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.''

''Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:''

''The President shall have power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.''

==Analysis of the text==
This section describes each section of the Constitution.

[[Image:Independence Hall Assembly Room.jpg|250px|thumb|The room in Independence Hall, Pennsylvania where the [[../Declaration of Independence/]]  and the Constitution were signed]] 
===Analysis of the Preamble===
The Preamble neither grants any powers nor inhibits any actions; it only explains the rationale behind the Constitution. The Preamble, especially the first three words (&quot;We the people&quot;), is one of the most quoted and referenced sections of the Constitution.

===Analysis of Article I===
Article I establishes the legislative branch of government, U.S. Congress, which includes the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Article establishes the manner of election and qualifications of members of each House. In addition, it provides for free debate in congress and limits self-serving behavior of congressmen, outlines legislative procedure and indicates the powers of the legislative branch. Finally, it establishes limits on federal and state legislative power.

===Analysis of Article II===
Article II describes the presidency (the executive branch): procedures for the selection of the president, qualifications for office, the oath to be affirmed and the powers and duties of the office. It also provides for the office of Vice President of the United States, and specifies that the Vice President succeeds to the presidency if the President is incapacitated, dies, or resigns, although whether this succession was on an acting or permanent basis was unclear until the passage of the 25th Amendment.

Article II also provides for the impeachment and removal from office of civil officers

===Analysis of Article III===
Article III describes the court system (the judicial branch), including the Supreme Court. The article requires that there be one court called the Supreme Court; Congress, at its discretion, can create lower courts, whose judgments and orders are reviewable by the Supreme Court. Article Three also requires trial by jury in all criminal cases, defines the crime of treason, and charges Congress with providing for a punishment for it, while imposing limits on that punishment.

===Analysis of Article IV===
Article IV describes the relationship between the states and the Federal government, and amongst the states. For instance, it requires states to give &quot;full faith and credit&quot; to the public acts, records and court proceedings of the other states. Congress is permitted to regulate the manner in which proof of such acts, records or proceedings may be admitted. The &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause prohibits state governments from discriminating against citizens of other states in favor of resident citizens (e.g., having tougher penalties for residents of Ohio convicted of crimes within Arizona). It also establishes extradition between the states, as well as laying down a legal basis for freedom of movement and travel amongst the states. Today, this provision is sometimes taken for granted, especially by citizens who live near state borders; but in the days of the Articles of Confederation, crossing state lines was often a much more arduous (and costly) process. Article IV also provides for the creation and admission of new states. The Territorial Clause gives Congress the power to make rules for disposing of Federal property and governing non-state territories of the United States. Finally, the fourth section of Article IV requires the United States to guarantee to each state a republican form of government, and to protect the states from invasion and violence.

===Analysis of Article V=== 
Article V describes the process necessary to amend the Constitution. It establishes two methods of proposing amendments: by Congress or by a national convention requested by the states. Under the first method, Congress can propose an amendment by a two-thirds vote (of a quorum, not necessarily of the entire body) of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. Under the second method, two-thirds of the state legislatures may convene and &quot;apply&quot; to Congress to hold a national convention, whereupon Congress must call such a convention for the purpose of considering amendments. Thus far, only the first method (proposal by Congress) has been used.

Once proposed—whether submitted by a national convention or by Congress—amendments must then be ratified by three-fourths of the states to take effect. Article V gives Congress the option of requiring ratification by state legislatures or by special conventions assembled in the states. The convention method of ratification has been used only once (to approve the 21st Amendment). Article V currently places only one limitation on the amending power—that no amendment can deprive a state of its equal representation in the Senate without that state's consent.

===Analysis of Article VI===
Article VI establishes the Constitution, and the laws and treaties of the United States made in accordance with it, to be the supreme law of the land. It also validates national debt created under the Articles of Confederation and requires that all legislators, federal officers, and judges take oaths to support the Constitution.

===Analysis of Article VII===
Article VII sets forth the requirements for ratification of the Constitution. The Constitution would not take effect until at least nine states had ratified the Constitution in state conventions specially convened for that purpose. New Hampshire became that ninth state on June 21, 1788. Once the Congress of the Confederation received word of New Hampshire's ratification, it set a timetable for the start of operations under the Constitution, and, on March 4, 1789, the government under the Constitution began operations.

The Constitution was ratified by the states in the following order:

===Analysis of the Conclusion===
The Conclusion ends the Constitution and is basically a summary of the document's date of completion and contains the delegate's signatures.

==Provisions for amendments==
The authors of the Constitution were aware that changes would be necessary from time to time if the Constitution was to endure and cope with the effects of the growth of the nation. However, they were also conscious that such a change should not be easy, in case it permits ill-conceived and hastily passed amendments. They also wanted to ensure that an amendment would not block action desired by the vast majority of the population. Their solution was to devise a dual process by which the Constitution could be altered.

The first option must begin in Congress which, by a two-thirds of the members vote in each house, may initiate an amendment. Alternatively, the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states may ask Congress to call a national convention to discuss and draft amendments. To date, all amendments have been proposed by Congress. The second option is that two-thirds of the state legislatures may convene and &quot;apply&quot; to Congress to hold a national convention, whereupon Congress must call such a convention for the purpose of considering amendments. Although state legislatures have occasionally requested the calling of a convention, no such request has yet received the concurrence required for such a convention. As of mid-2006, only the first method (proposal by Congress) has been used. 

In either case, an amendment must have the approval of the legislatures or of smaller ratifying conventions within three-fourths of the states before becoming a part of the Constitution. All amendments except one have been submitted to the state legislatures for ratification; only the 21st amendment was ratified by individual conventions in the states.

Amendments to the United States Constitution are considered &quot;articles in addition to and amendment of&quot; the original body of the text and are appended at the end of it.  This is the case even when an amendment revises or rescinds an existing clause or section.  There is no provision for expunging from the text obsolete or rescinded provisions.

Some people feel that demographic changes in the U.S.—specifically the great disparity in population between states—have made the Constitution too difficult to amend, with states representing as little as 4% of the population theoretically able to block an amendment desired by over 90% of Americans; others feel that it is unlikely that such an extreme result would occur. However, any proposals to change this would necessarily involve amending the Constitution itself.

Congressional legislation, passed to implement provisions of the Constitution or to adapt those implementations to changing conditions, also broadens and, in subtle ways, changes the meanings given to the words of the Constitution. Up to a point, the rules and regulations of the many agencies of the federal government have a similar effect. In case of objection, the test in both cases is whether, in the opinion of the courts, such legislation and rules conform with the meanings given to the words of the Constitution.

==Amendments==
The Constitution has a total of 27 amendments. The first ten, written in the [[../Bill of Rights/]], another Charter of Freedom, were ratified simultaneously. The following seventeen were ratified separately.

===The Bill of Rights (1-10)===
The [[../Bill of Rights/]] comprises the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Those amendments were adopted between 1789 and 1791, and all relate to limiting the power of the federal government. They were added in response to criticisms of the Constitution by the state ratification conventions and by prominent individuals such as Thomas Jefferson. These critics argued that without further restraints, the strong central government would become tyrannical. The amendments were proposed by Congress as part of a block of twelve in September 1789. By December 1791 a sufficient number of states had ratified ten of the twelve proposals, and the Bill of Rights became part of the Constitution. One of the failed proposals has yet to be ratified, while the other became the 27th amendment in 1992.

===Subsequent amendments (11–27)===
The 17 [[../Additional amendments to the United States Constitution/]] ratified after the Bill of Rights cover many subjects. The majority of the seventeen later amendments stem from continued efforts to expand individual civil or political liberties, while a few are concerned with modifying the basic governmental structure drafted in Philadelphia in 1787. 

Although there are 27 amendments to the United States Constitution, one of them, the 18th Amendment, is inoperative.  It was rescinded by the 21st Amendment, and is the only amendment to date to be directly and specifically repealed by another.

===Unratified amendments===
Over 10,000 Constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress since 1789; in a typical Congressional year in the last several decades, between 100 and 200 are offered. Most of these concepts never get out of Congressional committee, much less get proposed by the Congress for ratification. Backers of some amendments have attempted the alternative, and thus far never-utilized, method mentioned in Article V.

Of the thirty-three amendments that have been adopted by Congress and sent to the states for ratification, six have not been ratified by the required number of states. Four of these six amendments are still technically open and pending.  Since the early 20th century, Congress has usually, but not always, stipulated that an amendment must be ratified by the required number of states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states in order to become part of the Constitution. 

===Pending amendments===
The following amendments are still before the states; none of them has a ratification deadline attached:

*The Congressional Apportionment Amendment, proposed by the 1st Congress on September 25, 1789, defined a formula for how many members there would be in the United States House of Representatives after each decennial census. Ratified by eleven states, the last being Kentucky in June 1792 (Kentucky's initial month of statehood). In principle it may yet be ratified, though as written it became moot when the population of the United States reached ten million. 

*The Titles of Nobility Amendment, proposed by the 11th Congress on May 1, 1810, would have ended the citizenship of any American accepting &quot;any Title of Nobility or Honor&quot; from any foreign power. This amendment was ratified by 12 state legislatures.

*The Corwin Amendment, proposed by the 36th Congress on March 2, 1861, would have forbidden any attempt to subsequently amend the Constitution to empower the Federal government to &quot;abolish or interfere&quot; with the &quot;domestic institutions&quot; of the states (an implicit reference to slavery). It was ratified by only Ohio and Maryland lawmakers before the outbreak of the Civil War. Illinois lawmakers—sitting as a state constitutional convention at the time—likewise approved it, but that action is of questionable validity.  However, adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments after the Civil War likely means that the amendment would be ineffective if adopted. 

*The Child Labor Amendment, proposed by the 68th Congress on June 2, 1924, which stipulates: &quot;The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and prohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age.&quot; This amendment is now moot, since subsequent federal child labor laws have uniformly been upheld as a valid exercise of Congress' powers under the commerce clause.

===Expired amendments===
The following amendments are no longer before the states; neither of them were ratified by the required number of states prior to the attached ratification deadline:

*The Equal Rights Amendment, or ERA, which reads in pertinent part &quot;Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.&quot; Proposed by the 92nd Congress on March 22, 1972, it was ratified by the legislatures of 35 states, and expired on either March 22, 1979, or on June 30, 1982, depending upon one's point of view of a controversial ratification deadline three-year extension by the 95th Congress in 1978. Of the 35 states ratifying it, four later rescinded their ratifications prior to the extended ratification period which commenced March 23, 1979 and a fifth—while not going so far as to actually rescind its earlier ratification—adopted a resolution stipulating that its approval would not extend beyond March 22, 1979. There continues to be diversity of opinion as to whether such reversals are valid; no court has ruled on the question, including the Supreme Court. But a precedent against the validity of rescission was first established during the ratification process of the 14th Amendment when Ohio and New Jersey rescinded their earlier approvals, but yet were counted as ratifying states when the 14th Amendment was ultimately proclaimed part of the Constitution in 1868. 

*The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment was proposed by the 95th Congress on August 22, 1978. Had it been ratified, it would have granted to the District of Columbia–as though it were a state– full representation in the United States Congress, full representation in the Electoral College system, and full participation in the process by which the Constitution is amended.  It would have also repealed the 23rd Amendment. Ratified by the legislatures of only 16 states—less than half of the required 38—the proposed amendment expired on August 22, 1985.

===Proposals for amendments===
There are currently only a few proposals for amendments which have entered mainstream political debate. These include the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, the Balanced Budget Amendment, and the Flag-Burning Amendment.

== Examining Human Origins ==

The study of the deep past can be divided roughly into two sections: history, and prehistory.  ''History'' assumes that the culture or people being studied had writing of some sort -- that they kept records of what they bought and sold, what they ate, what they saved, what they spent, and what they believed.  Writing is one of the most important inventions of humans, and cultures that have writing are forever changed by it.  Yet writing did not exist in some places until very recently, and even the oldest writing in the world is no more than 6500 years old.  

By contrast, ''prehistory'' is the name we give to every part of human culture and experience that happened before the invention of writing.  Most of the planet Earth had some form of writing by 1950 CE, which meant that in some places, prehistory lasted into the twentieth century.  By contrast, prehistory extends back in time at least to 100,000 years ago.  Prehistory may extend even farther than that, to one million years or even three million years!  There is far more prehistory than history, and yet we know more about the last six thousand years than we do about the previous million.

Yet everything we know today about prehistory is as a result of the investigations of scientists.  Many different scientists are working together in order to uncover the mysteries of prehistory.  These scientists come in many types: paleoanthropologists, archaeologists, physical and cultural anthropologists, zoologists, chemists, botanists, physicists, historians and dedicated amateurs. It is difficult and under-appreciated work, but it is necessary if our understanding of the past is to advance.

=== Reconstructors of the Past ===
In order to understand prehistory, we first have to understand what these scientists are doing, and how they are doing it.

How do these different professions help us understand prehistory?  How can we reconstruct the past without having any writing from that time period?  In fact, each type of scientist mentioned has a specific role to play in understanding the past.  Archaeologists and paleoanthropologists often have first-contact responsibilities when it comes to prehistory.  Paleoanthropologists are scientists who look for and study old bones.  When they find such bones, a paleoanthropologist can often learn many things about the animal it came from.  Bones from an animal's limbs reveal whether an animal walked on two legs or four legs, whether it swam in the water or flew. A piece of a skull can reveal the size and shape of the animal's brain.  Pieces of vertebrae can tell a scientist whether the animal walked upright or hunched over.  Some bones even reveal what diseases an animal had.   In the case of exploring human origins, old bones may reveal how long humanity has walked on the Earth, and what we have done in the world.  

====Paleoanthropologists====
Paleoanthropologists combine the methods of paleontologists and biological anthropologists into one comprehensive study.  Paleontology is the study of fossil evidence of ancient creatures, and biological anthropology is the inter-disciplinary study of physical changes in humans.  Therefore, a paleoanthropologist is a scientist who studies fossil evidence of ancient human beings.  Paleoanthropologists have played a major role in discovering what we know about evolution today.

Although fossils are a major piece of the puzzle, the theory of human evolution was built with the help of several other anthropological fields, all closely tied to paleoanthropology.  For example, human behavioral ecology is the study of ancient human behavior and how it changed over time.  Similar to archaeology, this field revealed how humans have adapted to changing environments and advanced technologically through the stone age.  In addition, fields such as paleopathology, the study of ancient diseases, and osteology, the study of bones, have taken the findings of paleoanthropologists to new levels and provided more insight into the lives of ancient people.

==== Archaeologists ====
Archaeologists do a slightly different task in the study of prehistory. Where paleoanthropologists study old human bones, archaeologists study ancient dwelling or burial places.  Wherever people live, they often leave things behind when they move: pottery, an earring, food, tools, or garbage.  Sometimes they leave the whole house behind.  Where paleoanthropologists study bones, archaeologists study the remains of houses and shelters and camps where people lived.  In addition, archaeologists sometimes study grave-sites, where people are buried, to examine the things the dead person's relatives left behind.

Archaeologists work through the study not only of objects, but their relationships to one another.  When first excavating a site, an archaeologist will lay down a grid over the earth, usually constructed of stakes in the ground, and cords.  The grid divides the land beneath it into many small squares of equal size.  Once digging begins, a good archaeologist records what she or he finds, and where.  The grid helps define what else a given object was found near.  Thus, if a gold bracelet is found near the skeleton of a woman, the archaeologist may assume that the woman and the bracelet were buried at the same time.  On the other hand, a bronze sword in the ground forty feet away and ten feet deeper probably was not buried at the same time as the woman or the bracelet.

==== Chemists ====
Other professions perform supporting roles to archaeologists and paleoanthropologists.  Chemists can do tests on the chemical composition of objects from ancient sites.  Flint and obsidian, two types of stone used in prehistoric tools, have specific chemical signatures depending on where they come from, and obsidian from a volcano in eastern Turkey has a different signature than a volcano in Japan or in Spain or Italy.  If an archaeologist in Morocco finds a hunter buried with a flint spear made with Iranian flint, she knows that either the hunter traveled a very long way before he died, or that the hunter had dealings with traders from far away.  Chemists can also do ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#Carbon Dating|Carbon Dating]]'' studies, in which organic material like bone, antler or wood is subjected to a chemical test.  The test reveals the approximate age at which the organic thing died, and is usually accurate to within a century or two.

==== Zoologists, Botanists and Physicists ====

Zoologists and botanists help explore prehistory by studying the remains of animals and plants.  Botanists can count seeds found at an archaeological site, and note the different kinds of seeds and nuts present.  This reveals the landscape in which early humans lived.  Perhaps the plants were suited to warmer or colder climates, or maybe they are extinct.  Perhaps the plants had medicinal uses, or make food taste better.  The archaeologist can sometimes tell if the seeds were being stored for eating or for planting, simply by knowing how many of a given kind are being stored.  Zoologists can study animal bones to determine if the animal was ''[[Ancient History/Glossary#domesticated|domesticated]]'' or not.  Knife marks on the bone reveal whether the animal was killed in order to be eaten.  Small amounts of wool at a site can reveal whether or not a prehistoric culture sheared their animals to make thread and cloth.

Some physicists can do a similar test to radiocarbon dating called Potassium-Argon dating.  This technology can get the date of an object wrong by more than a thousand years -- but it can also give the rough ages for objects that are hundreds of thousands of years older than radiocarbon can detect.  Additionally, physicists have designed and built a number of technologies useful to archaeologists, including a side-scan ground-penetrating radar, that can find buildings and archaeological sites without digging them up.

Anthropologists are scientists who study human culture and behavior patterns.  They contribute to the study of prehistory by examining the tools, clothing and equipment left behind at archaeological sites, and determine how that equipment was made and what it was used for.  Physical anthropologists study human bones for signs of disease or malnutrition, and work with botanists and zoologists to reconstruct the diets of failed hunters.  Cultural anthropologists study how ancient cultures made things, and what they thought and believed, based on the objects those cultures created and then abandoned.

Once all these scientists have done their jobs and learned what they can from the objects left behind by our most distant ancestors, they issue a report on their findings.  A historian then takes the reports of many archaeologists, and tries to construct a coherent narrative or story of what was happening in the world or in a region of the world during the time period covered by these archaeological sites.

==== Amateurs and Volunteers ====

None of these jobs, from the historian to the paleoanthropologist, would be possible without the interest and excitement of dedicated and interested amateurs.  Amateurs may not have much scientific training, but they can do the digging at archaeological sites, and sort bones and record information from a site on the grid.  They can contribute to non-profit organizations that fund studies of prehistory, and they can read up on archeology and report the results to their friends.  Amateurs can use their heads, hearts, eyes, ears and mouths to understand the past, just like anyone else, and they can transmit the excitement of studying the past to others.

Sometimes when having several data models using shared objects in a ''WebObjects'' application, models load, initialization and connection simply fail with strange and unexpected exceptions. Typical exceptions are:

* &lt;code&gt;java.lang.IllegalStateException: registeredDatabaseContextForModel() Cannot register the database context for the model &lt;/code&gt;''&lt;Model name&gt;''&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;at com.webobjects.eoaccess.EODatabaseContext.registeredDatabaseContextForModel(EODatabaseContext.java:1145) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: ...
* &lt;code&gt;java.lang.IllegalStateException: addOrderByAttributeOrdering: attempt to generate SQL for com.webobjects.eocontrol.EOSortOrdering &lt;class com.webobjects.eocontrol.EOSortOrdering(&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;Attribute Name&gt;''&lt;code&gt; compareAscending)&gt; failed because attribute identified by key '&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;Attribute Name&gt;''&lt;code&gt;' was not reachable from from entity '&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;Entity Name&gt;''&lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;at com.webobjects.eoaccess.EOSQLExpression.addOrderByAttributeOrdering(EOSQLExpression.java:1803) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: ...
* ''etc.''

I saw several report of this bug in various mailing list, but no one leads to a right solution or a good explanation:

: http://lists.apple.com/archives/webobjects-dev/2005/Aug/msg00295.html
: http://www.wodeveloper.com/omniLists/webobjects-dev/2004/September/msg00255.html

==== Solution: ====
I've finally found that this problem is related to the models load and initialization order. Most of the time, EOF is able to initialize a group of models flawlessly. But in some circumstances, it just fails.

The best fix would be to make EOF dynamically analyse models groups, building a graph of dependancy with all entities for each group and ordering the models and the entities initializations according to this graph. But a such solution is a little bit more complex and should typically be integrated directly into the EOAccess layer.

To work around this bug with a simpler solution, you can add in the &lt;code&gt;userInfo&lt;/code&gt; dictionary of each model the &lt;code&gt;priority&lt;/code&gt; key assigned to a value of four digit, example: &lt;code&gt;0100&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0500&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;2000&lt;/code&gt;, ''etc.'' You must use priority values with the same number of digit, because these will be converted to strings, and if you set a priority of &lt;code&gt;500&lt;/code&gt;, the string value will be considered as higher than a priority of &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt;.

Then create a static method that perform an &lt;code&gt;assertConnectionDictionaryIsValid()&lt;/code&gt; with each model of the group sorted by priority:

&lt;pre&gt;
	private static final NSArray _PriorityDescendingModelSortOrdering = new NSArray(new Object[] {
		EOSortOrdering.sortOrderingWithKey(&quot;userInfo.priority&quot;, EOSortOrdering.CompareDescending), 
		EOSortOrdering.sortOrderingWithKey(&quot;name&quot;, EOSortOrdering.CompareAscending)
	});

...

	public static void assertModelGroupConnectionDictionariesAreValid(EOEditingContext editingContext, EOModelGroup modelGroup) {
		Enumeration models;
		EOAdaptor adaptor;
		EODatabaseContext databaseContext;
		EOModel model;

		// Get models enumerator from default group
		models = EOSortOrdering.sortedArrayUsingKeyOrderArray(modelGroup.models(), 
			_PriorityDescendingModelSortOrdering).objectEnumerator();

		while(models.hasMoreElements()) {
			model = (EOModel)models.nextElement();
			NSLog.debug.appendln(&quot;  Connecting &quot; + model.name() + &quot; model, userInfo = &quot; + model.userInfo() + &quot;...&quot;);
			databaseContext = EODatabaseContext.registeredDatabaseContextForModel(model, editingContext);
			adaptor = databaseContext.adaptorContext().adaptor();

			// Test connection dictionary
			adaptor.assertConnectionDictionaryIsValid();
			NSLog.debug.appendln(&quot;  The \&quot;&quot; + model.name() + &quot;\&quot; model is connected.&quot;);
		} // while
	} // assertConnectionDictionariesAreValid
&lt;/pre&gt;

The sort ordering here sort by descending model priority and ascending model name to ensure constancy on sort result.

You'll have to find the right model order: you can deduce it with logic drawing a dependency graph, or you can find it with tests and errors. Typically, when an exception has above is thrown, it's because the model initialization was done too late. I usually set priority to framework models from &lt;code&gt;1000&lt;/code&gt; (low) to &lt;code&gt;9000&lt;/code&gt; (high), and application models from &lt;code&gt;0100&lt;/code&gt; (low) to &lt;code&gt;0900&lt;/code&gt; (high).

==== Exception: ====
For some cases, this solution still does't help (see [http://lists.apple.com/archives/Webobjects-dev/2006/Oct/msg00000.html this message]). I suspect the entities ordering in model to be the problem (see [[#EOF fails to fetch or save entities when not correctly ordered in model]] below). If it's still not the case, you can try to use the [http://wonder.cvs.sourceforge.net/wonder/Wonder/Common/Frameworks/ERExtensions/Sources/er/extensions/ERXSharedEOLoader.java?revision=1.9&amp;view=markup ERXSharedEOLoader] class in [http://wonder.sourceforge.net Project Wonder].

=== EOF fails to fetch or save entities when not correctly ordered in model ===
: '''Authors:''' Francis Labrie&lt;br&gt;
: '''Affected products:''' ''WebObjects'' 5.2.x, 5.3.x&lt;br&gt;
: '''Bug reference:''' &lt;br&gt;

==== Problem: ====
Sometimes when using inherritance with entities in a data model in a ''WebObjects'' application, fetching or saving data may simply fails with strange and unexpected exceptions. Typical exception is:

* &lt;code&gt; com.webobjects.eoaccess.EOGeneralAdaptorException: sqlStringForKeyValueQualifier: attempt to generate SQL for &lt;/code&gt;''&lt;Qualifier Class&gt;''&lt;code&gt; (&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;Qualifier Expression&gt;''&lt;code&gt;) failed because attribute identified by key 'NeededByEOF0' was not reachable from from entity &lt;/code&gt;''&lt;Entity Name&gt;''&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;code&gt; at com.webobjects.eoaccess.EODatabaseContext._exceptionWithDatabaseContextInformationAdded(EODatabaseContext.java:4685) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: ...
* ''etc.''

==== Solution: ====
Typically, this kind of error occurs when the parent entity is in an another model which was initialized after the current entity model one (see [[#EOF fails to initialize models when not specifically ordered]] above) or when the parent entity is coming after the current entity in the alphabetically ordered list of entities of the current model. To illustrate the latter case: if your abstract parent entity name is &quot;Flower&quot; and you are fetching the concrete sub-entity &quot;Anemone&quot; while both entities are part of the same model, you can get this kind of exception on the first &quot;Anemone&quot; fetch.

To avoid this exception, simply edit the &quot;index.eomodeld&quot; file in a text editor and reorder the entities references in the array, putting parent entities above sub-entities. But you should then take care with the ''EOModeler'': you'll have to reorder these entities references each time you modify and save the model.

=== New sub-entity insertion fails because primary key is null ===
: '''Authors:''' initially reported by Chuck Hill&lt;br&gt;
: '''Affected products:''' ''WebObjects'' 5.2.x, 5.3.x&lt;br&gt;
: '''Bug reference:''' &lt;br&gt;

==== Problem: ====
When a sub-entity have a parent entity with a relationship set to ''propagate primary key'', any new sub-entity insertion when saving changes from an editing context will throw an integrity violation exception because the primary key column is set to &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.

==== Solution: ====
To avoid this bug, uncheck the ''Propagate primary key'' relationship property of the parent entity. Unfortunately, if the parent entity is not abstract, this solution will not be applicable: you'll probably have to modify the relationship modeling itself.

In the overview of disappearing cabinets, under a &quot;beginner&quot; spoiler warning, it basically gives away the final storyline to the last book currently on sale!  Shouldn't this be upgraded to a Intermediate warning?  It is a fairly critical concept that there ''is a way'' to get inside Hogwarts other than apperating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Procedures overview ==

I've written a complete simplified description of the entire beer making process in hopes of driving this book towards the goal of being a textbook. The entire simplified description should be understood by a student brewer, while all the details can be left out until the student is ready. This way, a teacher can instruct a student to read this chapter first and become familiar with the entire brewing process before being exposed to all the fine details. I may have put too many unneeded details into this page, but right now I really don't want to edit this down, since the work is fresh in my mind and thus not very objective.

The final section may not be entirely necessary, but I don't see enough information there to warrant a distinct chapter for it, or even an appendix. Perhaps other tips and tricks could be compiled into an appendix later..... perhaps legal restrictions could be addressed in such a page....

I removed and tried to avoid using specific volumes from this page - five gallons may be the standard batch size in the US, but it is by no means the only. Some kits provide merely enough ME to produce 2.5 gallon batches, and a few clever brewers I know brew in 55-gallon drums with 20 to 40 gallon batches. Besides, volumes are details, best left to recipies. --[[User:Schusselig|Schusselig]] 05:20, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

==Also needed==
Brewing processes that also need to be included (when I have the time) are Storage/Lagering and Filtration - although these are probably not major proceses in home brewing, they are important brewing processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">has anybody thought about makeing a visual timeline of this?

Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was pretty strong in Europe at some point in history (XVI-XVII century). It could be mentioned at least once. How about a propos the Battle of Vienna 1683 (-western forces were led by Polish-Lithuanian King)? There is nothing about the battles with the Ottoman Empire here.
Quote from wiki page about the Battle of Vienna: &quot;The battle marked the turning point in the 300-year struggle between the forces of the Central European kingdoms and the Ottoman Empire.&quot;

== Doesn't note it is incomplete ==

This Outline Chapter of the book covers only the period 1400-present, however the book begins with the [[European_History/A_Background_of_European_History#Introduction|Backround chapter]] in 7,000 BCE , continues with the [[European_History/The_Crises_of_the_Middle_Ages#Introduction|Middle Ages chapter]] from 5th century to 1400, and only then moves onto the subjects covered by the Outline chapter.  The Outline chapter should somehow be noted as currently being incomplete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== What is a regular expression? ===

A '''regular expression''' is a method of representing a string matching pattern.  Regular expressions enable strings that match a particular pattern within textual data records to be located and modified and they are often used within utility programs and programming languages that manipulate textual data. Regular expressions are extremely powerful.

=== Example applications ===

Various software applications use regular expressions to locate, select or modify particular sections text. For example, a regular expression could be used to:

* replace the word &quot;snake&quot; with the word &quot;serpent&quot; throughout an entire piece of text
* locate pieces of text containing the words &quot;fox&quot; and &quot;sheep&quot; on the same line

=== Regular expression components ===

Regular expressions are made up of three types of components:

* anchors used to specify the position of the pattern in relation to a line of text.
* character sets used to match one or more characters in a single position.
* modifiers used to specify how many times a character set is repeated.

=== Syntax varies across application programs ===

The syntax of regular expressions varies across application programs. For example the shell uses a limited form of regular expression called shell regular expressions for filename substitution, whereas [[AWK]] uses a superset of extended regular expressions syntax.

===Supporting Software===

Regular expressions are supported by various software tools, including command line tools, plain text editors and programming languages. Most of these tools are available for various computing platforms, including Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The tools use slightly different syntax styles. Let's look at some notable ones.

The tools:
* Command line tools
** grep
** egrep
** sed
* Plain text editors
** ed
** vi
** Emacs
* Programming languages
** Awk
** Java
** JavaScript
** .NET
** Perl
** PHP
** Ruby

A regular expression can be considered to be a little computer program that finds or isolates a subset of a larger set of text.  In the same way that an ordinary computer program needs a computer to execute it, a regular expression needs a software application to interpret it &amp;mdash; to give it meaning.

For example, a regular expression can be used to tell an editor to find the next occurrence of the word &quot;Chapter&quot; followed by several spaces and digits.  Or you can use a regular expression to tell the UNIX grep command to show only those lines of a file that contain the word &quot;Wiki&quot; followed by either the word &quot;Books&quot; or the word-fragment &quot;pedia&quot;.  We will discuss the exact syntax of such regular expressions in the next chapter.

A '''Chip Butty''' is a [[cookbook:sandwiches|sandwich]] made of chips (French fries).

== Ingredients ==
* [[cookbook:Chips|Chips]] from a chip shop or home made
* [[cookbook:Batch Loaf Bread|Batch Loaf Bread]] or (according to preference) sliced white bread, or pitta bread for kebab-shop style
* [[cookbook:Butter|Butter]]
* [[cookbook:Ketchup|Tomato Sauce]] (ketchup) or a brown sauce (optional)

== Procedure ==

# Make sure the chips are not too greasy and have been well drained.
# Take two slices of batch loaf (the heel works best) and butter both on one side, then apply ketchup and spread evenly over the bread.
# Next add chips in a manner akin to herringbone floor tiling, making sure to minimise any gaps. You can add multiple layers.
# Put both slices of bread together and eat immediately.

&lt; [[History of Embrun/Saint Augustine-de-Catherine/Life in Saint Augustine-de-Catherine from 1845-1848|'''Back to Life in Saint Augustine-de-Catherine from 1845-1848''']] &lt;/small&gt;

==Saint Augustine-de-Catherine: Saint Augustine-de-Catherine from 1848-1856==

===Connection to the Outside World===
In January 1848, the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada issued a request for a road to be built from Bytown (now Ottawa) to Saint Augustine-de-Catherine.


[[File:Saint-Augustine-de-Catherine-Road.jpg|450px|thumb|Map showing the route of the Saint Augustine-de-Catherine road compared to today's roads, cities and towns.]]
The corduroy road's construction began on January 14th, 1848. The road was completed and reached the small community on March 14th. Shocked at the ribbon of logs stretching as far as he could see, Jonathan Smithson, a young resident of Saint Augustine-de-Catherine, got on a horse and traveled down the road. He reached Bytown then rode back to Saint Augustine-de-Catherine, telling tales of the road winding through forests and fields to Bytown.

People in Saint Augustine-de-Catherine decided to use the road to export lumber. The road became known as the Saint Augustine-de-Catherine road and lasted until 1951.

===Prosperity===
This road brought prosperity to Saint Augustine-de-Catherine in the 1850s. A schoolhouse was built in 1853, when the village had 145 people. That year, the Saint Augustine-de-Catherine road was rebuilt out of cobblestone.

A small chapel was built in July 1853 to replace the log cabin used for religious ceremonies. Some people began rebuilding their homes out of stone. By 1854 nearly half the homes in Saint Augustine-de-Catherine were made out of stone. And the main road was rebuilt out of cobblestones, just like the Saint Augustine-de-Catherine road that branched off it. An interesting fact to note: Part of the route the Saint Augustine-de-Catherine road took is now a road in Embrun called Saint Augustine Road.

Some newcomers wanted to live closer to the river. However, the people who were already in Saint Augustine-de-Catherine told them not to start their home there, as the floodwaters extended out in that direction. But most of these newcomers didn't listen. They built their homes right by the river anyway. However, when the floods started in the following Spring, they understood their mistake. But many of them already spent all their money on a home by the river, and couldn't afford to move to a better spot. They tried to sell off their homes, but not many were going to fall for a home that would be pounded by floods the next spring. The 'river-dwellers' as the people living by the river were now called, eventually managed to sell their homes at a very low price. This started a cycle of the poorer people in the town living by the river.

In 1855, the Citizens Committee of Saint Augustine-de-Catherine decided to build a church in the town. It was completed on May 15, 1856. That day, the town was renamed Embrun after the town of Embrun, Hautes-Alpes in France.

So ended Saint Augustine-de-Catherine and began Embrun.

I'm going to start adding recipes here when I come with something particularly good --16:35, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
{{TOCright}}
If you try these recipes (especially the ones I've written myself) please [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Singkong2005/recipes_and_cooking_tips&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new give me feedback] - thanks. 

==My favorite recipes== 
==Good sites==
Check [http://www.recipezaar.com/recipes.php?chef=125458 Varsha's recipes] and [http://www.recipezaar.com/member/125458 homepage]. She also makes lots of good comments and suggestions on other recipes - I would try anything she gives 4 or 5 stars to. 

I've been using the [http://www.foodieview.com '''foodie view'''] recipe search engine, and it's fantastic - just choose the recipes that have 4 or 5 stars, and preferably have been rated by a lot of people. 

=== Beans, dal &amp; chickpeas ===
My own recipes:
*[[#Chana dal with panch phoran and pumpkin|Chana dal with panch phoran and pumpkin]]
*[[#Chana dal with pumpkin and sage|Chana dal with pumpkin and sage]]
*[[#My basic chickpea &amp; vegetable tagine|My basic chickpea &amp; vegetable tagine]]

Here's some that I found with foodie view: 
*[http://www.recipezaar.com/64224 Yellow split pea Dal Recipe] - Note I followed the advice in the comment by Varsha, and added q/2 tsp of garam masala 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and some mild chilli flakes. 
*[http://food.aol.com/food/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&amp;recipe_id=226762 Lentil Dal with Garlic-and-Cumin-Infused Oil]. I've also cooked this with other dals, such as chana dal, and it was still great. 
*[http://www.recipezaar.com/115127 Sambhar], which requires the preparation of [http://www.recipezaar.com/110487 Sambhar Masala] powder. Quite involved, but worth it. This is the kind of thing I would prepare for a dinner party. 
*[http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_1725,00.html Yellow Split Pea Soup]. Simple but good. An alternative to the mustard is to use a spoon of soy sauce (or to taste) for a bowl of soup. (I like to have it with mustard, but sometimes with soy sauce instead, as a change.) 
*[http://soup.allrecipes.com/az/MoroccanLentilSoup.asp Moroccan Lentil Soup]. I added 2 tsp salt. I served with couscous (not really necessary, but nice. 
*[http://food.aol.com/food/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&amp;recipe_id=522502 Split Pea-Spinach Dal with Cauliflower] - quite good as a side-dish. It uses a ''lot'' of mustard and cumin, making it slightly bitter, so I wouldn't use it as a meal on its own.  
*[http://food.aol.com/food/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&amp;recipe_id=671007 Spicy Red Lentil Dal with Pita Wedges] - a thick dal with Indian spices. I had no onion or garlic, so I used hing instead (half to one tsp). Also I had only black mustard, but it shouldn't (and didn't) cause a problem. 
*[http://allrecipes.com/recipe/sweet-and-spicy-soup-with-black-eyed-peas-and-sweet-potato/detail.aspx Sweet and Spicy Soup with Black-Eyed Peas and Sweet Potato] - I used dried black-eyed peas soaked overnight and fresh sweet potatoes and made a few adjustments, partly based on others' comments, and used fresh herbs. I'll write up my own version. (oops, forgot to write up... might try this again some time.)
*[http://www.recipezaar.com/76454 Black-Eyed Peas and Sweet Potato Stew]. Very good, hearty and flavorful. As I don't have Old Bay Seasoning (I've never seen it in Australia and I wasn't going to go hunting),  I did a little research and replaced it with: 3 bay leaves (torn on the edges to let flavor out), 1/2 tsp black pepper corns, 1/4 tsp cardamom seeds, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp black mustard, and 1/2 tsp paprika. I also didn't have celery seed, celery or parsley, so the extra sspices were to make up for that. Also added a handful of wholemeal pasta swirls, 1 tsp of dark brown sugar, 1 large green/orange capsicum (bell pepper), 6 tsp of Massel's &quot;beef&quot; style stock (that's vegan, imitation beef, but v nice) and 1 1/2 tsp salt. Bay leaves went in with the beans. Paprika and cinnamon also went in the pot. Whole spices were dry fried till they blackened a little, then added a little oil, fried some more and into the pot (I don't have a spice grinder, and I wanted to soften them properly - only partly successful with the cardamom). garlic, then capsicum and onion fried in EV olive oil with the ground ginger. Stock and salt go in when the beans are soft (as always), as does the tomato. Then sweet potato, and finally wholemeal pasta. Simmered till the sweet potatoes are soft. Very nice. I served with wholemeal toast drenched in EV olive oil.  The sweet potato was just tender when I ate it, not mushy - not sure if it might have been slightly nicer if I'd cooked it a little longer or cut them smaller. 05:44, 15 February 2007 (UTC)
*[http://www.recipezaar.com/111922 Black Bean Soup] - very nice. I used dried beans soaked overnight (1 and a quarter cups equates to two 400g/14-ounce tins). Used fresh thyme - it was a little lacking in flavor, so I added more thyme at the end (making 10 sprigs for the doubled recipe) and it was great. I stripped the leaves and tips of the sprigs and mixed them into the hot soup - didn't need extra cooking. These were young, soft thyme sprigs - older leaves might be much stronger.
*[http://www.recipezaar.com/133563 Creamy Chickpea &amp; Rosemary Soup] - nice, very easy, and proved popular with my friend that I cooked for. But it feels to me like it needs something else to be a 5 star recipe. Next time I'll try either a little bit of tomato/tomato paste, or some butter or cream. Or perhaps I'll try replacing the garlic with hing, or with onion and hing.

===Other meals===
* [[#My basic chickpea &amp; vegetable tagine]]
* [[#Bean salads]]

=== Vegetables ===
*Vegetables cooked briefly in miso &amp; water. Potato goes well; haven't tried other veg yet. 

It's good to have some quick and delicious food ideas, such as: 

* [[#Stir fried vegetables with hing (or garlic)|Stir fried vegetables with hing (or garlic)]]
* [[#Vegetables with herbs &amp; lentils|Vegetables with herbs &amp; lentils]]
* [[#Vegetables with turmeric and yellow bean sauce|Vegetables with turmeric and yellow bean sauce]] - have cooked this twice, and it was nice, but I need to test it a bit more...
* [[#Amit's Indian vegetables|Amit's Indian vegetables]]
* [http://www.recipezaar.com/74244 Curried String Beans]. Instead of curry powder (which I didn't have), I used 1 tsp garam masala and half a tsp turmeric. Also, I had no onion, so I used double the garlic. I had no fresh tomato, so i used a 440g tin diced tomato instead of tomato and tomato paste. Used 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper (use less salt if tinned tomatoes contain salt). Very nice, and went very well with the Spicy Red Lentil Dal with Pita Wedges (above).

===Quick soups===
A good soup is nourishing, tasty, and light, and keeps appetite at bay between meals. 

=== No-cooking ===
Add hot water and serve:
*[[Cookbook:Miso|Miso]] with silken tofu &amp; baby spinach (or seaweed, for a more traditional version). Avoid mature spinach - it should be the young tender leaves. 
*Good quality stock (e.g. Massel) with baby spinach (or salad greens), and possibly silken tofu. 

Microwave &amp; serve: 
*[[#How to eat brown rice|Brown rice with kecap manis]] - if you have leftover cooked brown rice. Option: tiny sprinkle of chilli.

===Marinades===
'''Garlic marinade''': In Java, I often saw tofu &amp; tempe done this way, and it was very nice. (It was also often fried plain, and wasn't very nice). Mash garlic on the grinding stone, add salt and a couple of spoons of water. Should be quite a watery mixture. Place tofu &amp; tempe, cut into oblong pieces, on the grinding stone, in the liquid, while the oil heats up. Press the pieces into the liquid (don't know if it helps, but that's what they did). Turn the pieces over so the other side contacts the garlicky liquid. Pick up and let the liquid drain off for a few seconds. Drop gently into the oil and deep fry. BE CAREFUL! As the pieces are wet, they will tend to splatter a bit. If you know what you're doing and don't stand too close, it seems to be fine... but remember, I warned you! 

'''Bu Yem's marinade''': I don't know whether this was a common recipe, or a specialty of Bu Yem, the East Javanese woman who cooked for me sometimes. Garlic, ginger, galangal, turmeric root, coriander, cumin and salt. (I can't remember if she added chilli - probably a little.) Grind the spices and add enough water to make a thin paste. Soak tofu &amp; tempe in this (a few hours, or overnight in the fridge). Fry as with the garlic marinade. I don't know the proportions, so go by experience or seek advice. 

Now, strict vegetarians please avert your eyes. This marinade goes really well with ''ikan lele'', the delicately flavored freshwater catfish popular in Indonesia - the cheapest but also the best-tasting fish. (Nothing like the large, strong-tasting catfish I tried in Australia... and yes, in spite of all the spices, I could tell that the ''lele'' was delicately flavored.) From the very delicate flavor of the lele I had in Indonesia, I would say that I haven't eaten the shitty ones! If you're in Indonesia though, get help when buying the fish... you don't want the fish that have been used for [http://vasco-pyjama.livejournal.com/188455.html cleaning up rather disgusting... er... water].

===Desserts===
*Adzuki (red) beans with cinnamon, palm sugar and cinnamon is easy, but not quick... you need to soak the night before (or several hours ahead) and simmer for perhaps 30 minutes or more. There's not much to it but I'll write the recipe later.
*Indonesian ''kacang hijau'' (green bean). Soak mung beans overnight, then boil till soft with pandanus leaves and palm sugar (the lighter one, or a mix of the dark red palm sugar with ordinary sugar). Make it to a porridge-like consistency. 
*Yoghurt with apricot &amp; toasted almond. Michelle made this, and it was delicious. Natural yoghurt (home made is nice, and cheaper); mix chopped dried apricots with syrup. Toasted almond slivers with a little olive oil and cinnamon powder. Add the almonds and apricot syrup mixture to the yoghurt, according to taste.

==Good foods for vegetarians &amp; vegans==

This is about taste, pleasure, satisfaction, not just about nutrition - I'm assuming you know to get protein from legumes (and/or dairy/eggs), and that if you don't eat a lot of animal products you should consider B12 supplements. 

There are some foods that I find particularly satisfying and - and when they're well made, I feel that being vegetarian isn't a sacrifice at all. Some of my favorite things are:

*Legumes. The variety of legumes makes for a variety of meals... even if I only had one recipe for dal, at least it would taste different when I made it with different legumes (chick peas, black-eyed peas, lentils, adzuki beans...). They also make me feel great physically - I was satisfied but felt lighter. It feels more easily digested than meat, and maintains a healthy blood sugar level as well as making you very &quot;regular.&quot; (The soluble fiber content contributes to the last two benefits.)
*Baby jackfruit. Delicious, mild flavor with a satisfying texture. The first time I had this, in a coconut-based soup called &quot;lodeh,&quot; I wasn't sure if it was meat or a vegetable. Also used to make gudeg, a kind of stewed, spiced &amp; sweet baby jackfruit. Some versions use chicken (so ask, if you're Indonesia, but maybe take the answer with a grain of salt). Vegetarian versions here, but I haven't tried the recipes: [http://fooddownunder.com/cgi-bin/recipe.cgi?r=276321 White Curry Jackfruit - (Gudeg Putih)], &amp; one in Indonesian, [http://www.melroseflowers.com/mkic/resep/sayur/gudeg_nangka.html Gudeg Nangka] 
*tempe - pressed soybean cake. I love this in Indonesia, where it's bought from a cart that goes down the street each morning, with a heavy layer of natural mold. Dipped in a mix of garlic, salt and a little water (and occasionally marinated in other spices such as coriander, cumin, ginger, galangal and turmeric root) before frying, it was delicious. I avoid it in Australia, where it comes from a packet - though I had a nice tempe burger in Nimbin, with sauce, mayo and lots of salad that covered up any deficiencies in the tempe. 
*Organic milk - preferably from a cold climate where the cows make nicer milk. 
*Coconut cream - goes well in most dals and in desserts. I've discovered delicious coconut cream in a tetra pak, ''Kara'' brand, from Indonesia and available at my local Indian shop. However you buy it, stick to the cream - as far as I can work out, the difference is just the water (and maybe thickener and flavor) that they put in the coconut milk and lite coconut cream.
*Good quality stocks. My favorite (in Australia) is [http://www.massel.com/products.shtml Massel] - no flavor enhancers, no animal products, yet a great flavor and comes in beef/chicken/vegetable style. Interestingly, meat-eaters think they taste like meat, but life-long vegetarians don't find they have the &quot;off&quot; taste and smell of meat. 
*Fresh vegetables. That's '''fresh''' vegetables. Fresh. When you buy veg and cook them the same day, it's amazing how much better and more satisfying they are. If the vegetables you eat are 2 weeks old, no matter how well cooked they are, you'll find yourself daydreaming about hamburgers and such.

=Misc=
Here are some notes and recipes... feel free to browse. 

==Simplicity==
I'm getting into simplicity. A couple of flavors can be enough to make a  great meal. This morning it was cracked black pepper and turmeric. I microwaved some chopped veg (a chopped carrot with a spoon of tomato paste and 1/8 tsp hing, for a minute, then a chopped yellow squash, cooked together for maybe 2 minutes), then added the black pepper (1/2 tsp) and turmeric (1/4 tsp), salt (3/4 tsp) and cooked kidney beans. Heated till it started bubbling slightly (2 minutes) then 4 minutes on minimum heat. Very nice. Would also work well with chickpeas. 

Not that I'm giving up on the wonderfully complex flavors of Thai curries, Indian sambhars, African tangines and Middle-Eastern baharat, of course. But it's good to have a simple and delicious option as well. --04:16, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

== Philosophy ==
My personal aims are pleasure, energy, well-being. A broader aim is encouraging a diet which causes less damage to the environment and less suffering to animals. And possibly promotes justice (a la &quot;Fair Trade,&quot; though I'm still unsure how much I believe in the effectiveness of this).

I'm trying to eat more veg, and be more like those long-lived Okinawans. Or, to be more precise, I want to increase my &lt;sup&gt;veg&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(grain + dal)&lt;/sub&gt; intake ratio. I.e. more high water content food, providing satisfaction and nutrition with fewer calories.

===Low meat versions===
I know that many people are not ready to give up meat entirely, but want to eat more vegetables. Many of these recipes are suitable to use either as an accompaniment to a meat dish, or can have a little bit of meat added to satisfy the [[/craving|craving]]. (You may find, though, that the vegetarian versions are more satisfying than you expected.)

====Casseroles====
One way to get the most out of the meat is to use a small amount of an older, more strongly flavored cut of meat, in slow cooked casserole style dishes - try mutton or hogget, or ask your butcher for what has good strong flavor for casseroles. This works especially in the Middle-Eastern and North African dishes.

You may benefit from the extra browning effect of cooking it in the oven, or perhaps on the stovetop, rather than in the microwave. I'm not really sure how much difference there is, though - certainly any form of slow cooking will break down the proteins and bring the flavor out. 

===Cravings for something sweet===
If you feel like something sweet, consider that a cup of tea with a teaspoon or three of sugar can be very pleasantly sweet, while not having nearly as much sugar as a soft drink (9 tsp to a can, they say!) or a slice of cheesecake. 

I avoid sweet things until at least mid-afternoon. If I have something sweet in the morning, I want to keep eating all day. 

===Environment===
There's a new diet, called the &quot;100 mile diet&quot; or something like that. It's based partly on the assumption that the major environmental impact of what we eat is transporting it long distances from where it is grown. I believe this assumption is wrong. It depends on the form of transport, and how bulky or heavy the food is - air travel is fuel-hungry, though the impact of a small piece of chocolate made from cocoa that's flown across the world hardly matters. If we're talking about sea freight, that is extremely low in fuel usage due to the huge size and large Froude number (i.e. streamlined character) of the ships. Thus I'd expect that legumes shipped from India would have far less environmental impact than beef grown locally. 

I don't know the full answer on this, but I plan to look into it, sometime before the end of 2006. 
&lt;!--debunk? article/letter for Crikey or...?--&gt;

==Cautions==
*'''Anything containing turmeric will cause a yellow stain.''' Don't slop it on your best shirt (or if you do, run for the laundry), or spill it on an expensive carpet or white tablecloth. Plastic cooking utensils will change color permanently (unless they're black). Don't let this put you off - brightly colored foods are often extremely good for you, and I've heard turmeric is good for cancer. (I'm not going to look up a source for that claim, because I don't really care - as long as it tastes good, and I'm getting a varied diet rich in veg, my health will benefit.)


== Where to find good recipes ==
I like to follow recipes (more or less) but as I've become more confident, I use my own judgement and experiment more. 

'''The books that got me started.''' When following some of the recipes, you may need to reduce the amount of chilli used, to avoid breathing fire - I only use a fraction of the chilli recommended in the Thai and Indian cookbooks. (Note - the ISBN can help you find the book, but won't show you other editions of the same book - so also search by book and author's name if you have problems): 
* '''Kurt Kahrs, ''Thai Cooking.''''' The author cooked at the Bangkok Hilton (from memory). This is the book that first taught me to cook well, and taught me that the secret to learning is to have an excellent cookbook. My brother's Thai girlfriend gave this to my mum as a present, and I found my own copy for $3.50 at a sale. I learnt to make my own curry pastes and developed a reputation among my friends as a cook, largely thanks to this book. Since going vegetarian I haven't been cooking so much thai, but some of the recipes do adapt well for vegetarians, especially if you make an exception for shrimp paste... (not sure if there's a a vegetarian alternative for that). &lt;small&gt;ISBN 078581731X, ISBN 1931040273, ISBN 1850764204 &amp; ISBN 0831787244&lt;/small&gt;
* See also this [http://www.geocities.com/cdsiam/thaifood/index.htm list of Thai cookbooks], sorted by their rating at online bookstores. I've used ''Thailand, the Beautiful Cookbook'' &lt;small&gt;(ISBN 0002550296)&lt;/small&gt; and it's good, and makes a great coffee table book, but Kahrs' book is my first choice. 
* '''Graimes, ''Vegetarian - the Greatest Ever Vegetarian Cookbook.''''' I'm suspicious of books with recipes from every kind of cuisine - sometimes they're bland and unauthentic. This one, however, has some great recipes. My tagines are partly adapted from this book (though the one in the book is unnecessarily involved, in my view, with coating vegetables with the oil &amp; spices and grilling them before adding them to the dish - my experience is that it's delicious with or without this fiddly, time-consuming step.) It has a habit of recommending organic vegetables and such - I ignore this hippy propaganda. &lt;small&gt;ISBN 0681020725, ISBN 0754800903&lt;/small&gt;
* '''Chandra Padmanabhan ''Dakshin: Vegetarian Recipes from South India''''' - gave me a whole new approach to Indian spices and dals. Fairly daunting recipes to look at, but I luckily had an Indian flatmate (Amit, who already knew about North Indian cooking) who got into it and demonstrated - and I learnt that the recipes are delicious, and not so hard when you understand what's going on. If you're a keen, patient student, you can learn a lot from this book. &lt;small&gt;ISBN 9625935274, ISBN 020718187, ISBN 0062511750.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Books that I might buy or borrow:'''
* '''Nancie McDermott, ''Real Vegetarian Thai''''' gets a 4.5-star rating on Amazon. It apparently has curry paste recipes (no adding curry paste from supermarkets, thank [[w:Flying Spaghetti Monster|God]]! And Fried Cashews with Chilies and Green Onions...? my mouth is watering at the thought. &lt;small&gt;ISBN 0811811514&lt;/small&gt;
* '''Rachel Carter, ''The Essential Vegetarian Cookbook''''' - could be interesting, for quick recipes. &lt;small&gt;ISBN 1571459987&lt;/small&gt;


=== Online recipes ===
[http://www.foodieview.com foodie view] searches for recipes and ranks them by rating - so you find recipes that other people think are good.
 
Apart from that... If you know a link to someone whose recipes you think I'd like, especially if it's an online source, please let me know on my [[User talk:Singkong2005|talk page]].

==Hot drinks==
It's good to have a selection of teas - keeps the appetite at bay, improves digestion. Can help get things moving in the alimentary canal of a morning. 

My favorites include: 
*Rosehip 
*A nice black tea. Flavor varies a lot (you'll notice it if you drink it regularly). Try different teas to see which you like. My favorites are the Twinings range, especially English Breakfast &amp; Prince of Wales (a bit smoky). 
*Dark berry tea - found in a Polish shop - which goes to show, it pays to experiment. 
*Mint tea. Peppermint tea bags can be nice, but it's far better to pick fresh mint (e.g. spearmint, garden mint or other variety) from the garden. 

In the morning, it's good to start with teas that have a slight laxative effect - black or white tea, or rosehip tea, are pretty good. Having a piece of fruit will also help - apples are suitable (because of their pectin content I think). But find something that you enjoy, and that makes you feel good.

== Rice ==
I'm starting to experiment with brown rice. I liked it when the Hare Krishnas cooked it when I went to Veg Soc at Sydney Uni in '96-7 or thereabouts. It was very soft, with a nice but mild flavor. 

I avoid white rice when I can - little fiber and nutrients, not very filling so you can keep stuffing your face too easily. 

Brown rice is more challenging to cook, but it's not difficult once you learn. 

===Cooking brown rice===
#Buy a good rice,&lt;ref name=&quot;rice&quot;&gt;If I'm in Australia, I never, ever buy anything from SunRice - not rice cakes or anything. I just don't like the taste or texture at all.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#follow the instructions on the packet for ratio of water to rice. The ratio will vary according to the type of rice, so the packet is your best guide.
#I like to cook it by the absorption cooking in the microwave, (or on the stove if need be). 
#I bring it to the boil, and then let it cook on minimum power for 30 minutes or so while I make the rest of the meal. And if I put it on early, it won't hurt the rice it to let it sit while I finish cooking the meal (leave the lid on keep the heat in, and it will keep cooking slowly, getting softer).
#If using the stove, the minimum temperature is probably too high, so after it's been simmering for 15 minutes, turn it off and leave it for another 15 minutes or so (and perhaps put the minimum temperature on again). Something like that - I don't measure the time, I just go by feel and make sure it's cooked for a long time till it's soft. 

It should come out very soft. 

If you need to use the microwave for something else, that's not a big problem. Get the rice cooking early, then swap the dishes when you need to. As long as the rice is near boiling, it will keep cooking. Perhaps wrap it in a towel if it's out for a long time (though I don't bother) and pop it in again later and bring it back to a simmer. 

Make it mushy. If you follow the instructions. I used to dislike mushy rice, and made an art of cooking rice so that it was just tender but still separate. But in Indonesia I got used to having it mushy - it seems to mix better with the food and the sauce. Now, with brown rice it's even more important, as if it's not mushy, it's probably chewy, and that makes eating into hard work. It's your choice, but I like mushy.

===How to eat brown rice===

It's delicious on its own with kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce) - I often have a small bowl like this if I'm in the mood for a second course. 

It goes better with some dishes than with others, so I'm still experimenting. Strongly flavored tagines go well with brown rice. The Hare Krishnas' mild curries also went well. I'll keep you posted as I learn more.

== Vegetables ==

If you have good quality vegetables, it's often best to do them done simply to make the most of their flavor. The '''Stir fried vegetables with hing (or garlic)''' is an example of this approach. 

Or you can go for something more full flavored, such as a tangine (yet to be posted).

=== Stir fried vegetables with hing (or garlic) ===
Great accompaniment for Indian food such as dal. 

Very simple - you need: 
* oil 
* hing&lt;ref name=&quot;h&quot;&gt;Hing is the Indian name, and at an Indian shop they'll know what it is. Asafetida (or asafoetida) is the English name often used in cookbooks. Such an ungainly name. It's a powdered resin, with a pungent smell. &lt;/ref&gt; '''or''' garlic. Not both. 
* vegetables 
* salt. 

Chop the vegetables, heat the oil, medium hot. Once it's hot enough to sizzle when you add a pinch of hing (or garlic), then add all the hing (or garlic). Avoid  burning. Add the vegetables, starting with what takes longest to cook. 

For example, I cooked it tonight as follows: 
* 1/2 tsp hing in the hot oil, stirred briefly, then chopped vegetables&lt;ref&gt;(when stir frying or sauteing, vegetables should be chopped fairly thin, no more than 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm. Not in very &amp; wide flat pieces, as they can then tend to stick together. French fry shaped is acceptable, or slightly flatter, or in thin wedges.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows: 
* small pontiac potato, (quick cooking, great flavor), cut into narrow lengths, and a small carrot, chopped (I could tell you how I like to do it, but some people might do it wrong and cut their fingers off); then once that had cooked a few minutes, but not yet soft... 
* half a head of broccoli, cut into florets, and half a zucchini, chopped as for the carrot.
* 1/2 tsp salt. 
* left until all the veg were soft enough, but still slightly firm. 

Tonight there was enough there for a satisying side dish (with dal) for two hungry guys. 

If eating with dal in a bowl, as I do, I advise a separate plate or bowl for the veg so they don't mix together in one blend of flavors.. 

Variations: You can add one or more spices to this - don't add too much until you've got the hang of it. A little fresh or dried chilli, added early. (I prefer not to fry chilli with the oil unless I have a cook lid on the pan AND a good exhaust fan. Half a teaspoon of turmeric sprinkled over &amp; stirred in, a few minutes before the end. A little mustard, or cumin seed or curry leaves fried with the hing should also work well. 
Thanks to Amit for the basic idea. --14:07, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

===Vegetables with turmeric and yellow bean sauce===
This is inspired by a yellow curry recipe in Kurt Kahrs' book... though the only thing left from the original recipe is the idea of using turmeric and yellow bean sauce&lt;ref name = &quot;ybs&quot;&gt;Yellow bean sauce, also called thin soy sauce or even white soy sauce, not to be confused with &quot;light soy sauce&quot;! It's a Thai sauce, usually found in major Asian grocery stores that stock a variety of nationalities' foods. (In Sydney, there's a store on Sussex street, near the Sussex Centre, down some stairs). Made from yellow soy beans, I think. It's still a black color, but you can almost see through it, and it has a much lighter flavor, though still salty. You might be able to get away with using a standard &quot;light soy sauce&quot; and using a quarter as much - however I wouldn't, and I don't guarantee it will work well.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Choose fresh vegetables in season, including tomatoes and onions (preferably spanish onions). I wouldn't use spinach or silverbeet in this one. 

Chop vegetables into bite size pieces. The total should be enough to slightly overfill a 2 L dish if chopped and piled together except you won't put them in all at once, and they will settle down, enabling you to add more as it progresses. (I just figure it out as I go along, but I'm trying to give an idea of quantity)

Put the harder veg in first (cauliflower, carrots), sprinkle with:
* 1/2 to 1 tsp turmeric
* about 40 ml yellowbean sauce, 
* chilli flakes to taste. (I'd use a teaspoon of mild chilli flakes)
...and start cooking. Cover and cook on high in the microwave for a few minutes; or add a few spoons of water and bring to a simmer in a covered saucepan. Don't overcook - they should be just starting to soften a little when the next ones go in. 

Then add the ones that need less cooking (Japanese pumpkin, eggplant if it's tender without prominent seeds, squash, tomato), mix and heat again; continue this way through vegetables such as zucchini, and lastly putting in things like broccoli and green beans which only need a few minutes. 

''Use your own judgement for times - it will depend on the quality and varieties sold in your area. Tomato can go in earlier or later - earlier for a smoother sauce; later for a fresher taste.'' 


Variations: Add coriander powder with the turmeric, 1/2 to 1 tsp, and/or a teaspoon of regular soy sauce, and/or a teaspoon of grated ginger. My experience with this was that it needed a lot more cooking for the flavors to blend and mellow - it was actually better the next day. Personally I prefer the light flavor of the simpler recipe given above.

===Amit's Indian vegetables===
Another of the recipes I got from Amit... actually just a variant of the one above.

Start with a 2 L saucepan. Heat 2 tsp oil, then add:
*1/4 tsp hing
*1/2 tsp cumin
*1/2 tsp mustard (''or'' use mustard oil, later)
*curry leaves, several (optional)
*mango powder (amchur) (optional)
Fry the spices for a minute, don't let them burn. Add:
*Chopped vegetables, to almost reach the top of the saucepan, adding the slower-cooking vegetables first. I like to use two or three types. Suitable vegetables include cauliflower, potato, eggplant, tomato. 
*1 tsp salt
*3/4 tsp turmeric
Stir to mix in spices, adding a couple of spoons of water if necessary to avoid sticking. When heated through, cover saucepan and cook on a low heat until vegetables are soft enough.

Variations: Vary the result by using different vegetables. E.g. whether or not you use tomato makes an enormous difference to the flavor, though it's nice both ways. 


==Tagine==
Tagines are a North African style of richly spiced, slow cooked dish. 

They often have a sweet ingredient such as apricot or raisins. I've found apple works well - placed in early so it breaks down and sweetens the sauce. Pumpkin may be used instead, or as well as the fruit.

My versions of these dishes use a vegetable base, sometimes with chick peas. 

They can be cooked on the stove, in the oven, or in the microwave. The oven give a nice browning effect, and some caramelisation, and the stove does this a little bit too. I mainly use the microwave as it's easiest, but I'm going to try the others. 

Notes: 
* If this is different to what you'd ever usually cook, don't be put off by the list of ingredients. Once you've done it a few times, you'' find it's quicker, and you can start changing the mix of spices slightly, for variety.
* These recipes often have a lot of ground cinnamon. A side-effect is a slightly powdery effect when you eat it. If this bothers you, reduce the amount of cinnamon slightly and the effect will disappear. 
* The vegetable pieces don't have to be very small - larger pieces are nice, and chopping time is reduced, but it will need to simmer for a bit longer. 
* Use your judgement and preferences to decide which vegetables to use. Zucchini goes well, and possibly swede and turnips (I'm planning to try them - I saw them in a recipe online). When I was cooking a Baharat vegetable dish with a friend, snow peas found their way in... I don't think snow peas suit tagine or baharat - I leave them for stir fries. But it's entirely up to you. 

==My basic chickpea &amp; vegetable tagine==
Here's one I cooked on 12 July 2006. I've used this basic recipe regularly, with consistently good results, so this time I'm recording exactly how I did it. Most often I just use vegetables and eat it with a good wholemeal bread, but this time I added chickpeas. 

Use a clear 2L microwave dish. 
Add: 
* 1 T ground cinnamon 
* 1 T ground coriander 
* 2 t turmeric
* 1/2 t cumin (up to 2 t... I just reduced it to get a different effect)
* 1/2 t chilli flakes (To taste. Or use fresh chilli or black pepper)
* 1 red onion, chopped
* 2 t salt
* 1 t Massels stock powder (beef style) (optional)
* the harder chopped vegetables (the veg that needs cooking for longer - I used 1 carrot, half sweet potato; if you use potato or cauliflower, put it in now; pumpkin).
* 2 to 4 T tomato paste
* a little water (say 1 cup - use boiling water if you want to speed it up a little)

Cook in microwave to while chopping the next ingredients

Place in microwave, and start preparing:
* 1 small apple, chopped. Remove core, of course, but don't bother removing skin. Or use another sweet ingredient: apricots, dried apricots (avoid the heavily preserved ones with sulfur, that make you cough); or sultanas/raisins. (I wonder how peach would taste...?)
* 1 400g tin chickpeas, drained (or a cup or so of home-cooked chickpeas). Optional.
* 1 red onion, chopped
* 2 t salt
* 1 t Massels stock powder (beef style) (optional)
* the harder chopped vegetables (the veg that needs cooking for longer - I used 1 carrot, half sweet potato; if you use potato or cauliflower, put it in now; pumpkin).
* 2 to 4 T tomato paste
* a little water (say 1 cup - use boiling water if you want to speed it up a little)

* chopped vegetables - now add the ones that cook relatively quickly: Japanese or Kent pumpkin; a few button mushrooms, halved or quartered, go very nicely; eggplant goes very well; broccoli goes well, but add this a few minutes later - and remember its distinctive taste also changes the taste of the dish, which can be nice as a change.
* more water if needed (it's all guesswork, really - I was going to say there's no wrong answer, but considering some of the things my flatmates used to cook at Abercrombie St, I know that's not true. Add another cup, as long as the water level isn't more than 2/3 of the dish).

Cook further - bring to a simmer, then reduce the power and simmer for, say, 15 minutes. Mix in

* 1-2 T Extra virgin olive oil

Taste test, and adjust the flavor if necessary.

===Pumpkin and bean tagine===

''Note: this is for my own notes - I haven't cooked it for years, and I recall it was slightly disappointing in the vegetarian version. I'll add Massels stock powder and see if that solves it. A &quot;low meat version&quot; should also work very well if you're a carnivore - just add say 200g of mutton or hogget.''

This gives a much milder, lighter version of tagine. 

* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (if unavailable, next best might be 1 tsp of sweet paprika - but make sure there's some form of chilli or (black) pepper in the dish, otherwise you'll miss out on the hotness.)
* 2 tsp turmeric
* 4 medium tomatoes, ripe, chopped. (Or 400g tin diced tomatoes if unavailable)
* 2 tsp sugar (optional - shouldn't be necessary if you've used a nice ripe pumpkin)
* 1 tsp chopped fresh chilli, or 1/2 tsp chilli flakes or powder; or to taste.
* 1 tbs raisins
* about 250g pumpkin, cubed
* 500 g green beans, halved
* 1 tbs vinegar (white wine vinegar should be nice; not sure about balsamic)
* 2 tsp Massels beef style stock powder (or vegemite, 1/4 tsp might help?)
* 2 tsp salt or to taste. (Note: if you use a stock powder other than Massels, it might already have a lot of salt, so don't overdo it.)

'''Vegetarian version:''' Use a 2L or larger casserole dish. Put ingredients up to chilli in the casserole dish, (saving raisins, pumpkin, beans and vinegar for later). Bring to a simmer. Add raisins, pumpkin, beans and vinegar and cook till pumpkin is very soft.

'''Low-meat version:''' Note that you may not need the stock powder if you are using meat - or not as much. Use a 2L or larger casserole dish. Put ingredients up to chilli in the casserole dish, (saving raisins, pumpkin, beans and vinegar for later) together chopped meat, and cook for 1 hour or until meat is quite tender. Then add raisins, pumpkin, beans and vinegar and cook till pumpkin is very soft.

==Baharat==

Baharat is a wonderful Middle-Eastern spice mix, a little bit like tagine but with no turmeric, and with paprika, pepper, cloves, cardamom and nutmeg. I'll post my recipe here when I can... you can also buy it from Middle-Eastern stores, but it's a bit of a gamble - I tried buying it from one shop, didn't like it at all, and now always make my own. 

You can use it as in the tagine recipes, above - however if if you've ground the coriander yourself, it will have a quite rough texture, and you may be better sauteing it briefly in olive oil on the stove, before adding the vegetables. I'm still experimenting with this.

===Making the Baharat spice mix===
II need to find tthe cookook, but it goes something like this: 

/3	cup	Black pepper
* 1/3	cup	Coriander powder
* 1/4	cup	Cinnamon
* 2	Tbs	Cloves, ground
* 1/3	cup	Cumin
* 2	tsp	Cardamom, ground
* 1/4	cup	Nutmeg, ground
* 1/2	cup	Paprika, ground

That's moderately spicy - reduce the black pepper to reduce the heat. (You can always add more later). 

Optional: grind the spices yourself for an even better flavor. Takes work. It's best to dry roast the spices first - this makes them grind more easily (and it's supposed to bring out the flavor).

For cinnnamon, use cassia bark for a slightly stronger flavor - that's the straight one rather than the quills. Cassia is standard in Middle-Eastern  and Indian cooking, though it's usually called cinnamon. 

===Using Baharat===
You can fry it with onions in olive oil - or just put it into the sauce as you start. If it's rough ground, you'll need to make sure it's cooked enough - dont' add a big amount of Baharat at the end of the cooking time or it'll be gritty. 

I find it goes well with tomato, and with pumpkin.

For, say, a 2L dish/saucepan almost full of veg and/or chick peas, use 1 Tbs or more of Baharat. 

Optional: add Massels chicken or beef style stock powder. 

Pasta sauce: A tiny amount of Baharat gives a lift to tomato based pasta sauce. Say 1/2 tsp in 2 L of sauce.

==Introduction to legumes ==
===Soaking===
Rinse, discarding any legumes that are broken or have holes in them, as well as any pebbles or other crap. I don't worry too much about defective legumes - I just remove any that float... it usually becomes an issue if they've been stored for a long time and have been eaten by insects, which does lead to a stale taste if it's at an advanced stage. 

But... ''the important thing is pebbles'' - not good for your teeth. Usually I find it's not a problem, but be especially careful if you're using a new source or a new type of legume. 

===Cooking===
Don't add salt until they are soft enough that you'd be happy to eat them. Salt stops the legumes getting nice and soft. But don't add right before serving as well - give the salt time to be mixed and absorbed in. 

Pressure cookers are often used, but as long as the legumes are soaked for several hours this is quite unnecessary. Mostly they will cook in 20 min or less - even chickpeas should be nice and soft by this time, though it depends on the batch. 

The smaller lentils don't need soaking, but I prefer to soak all of them. I figure that the soaking process activates the enzymes that start to break down the tough material inside, ready for sprouting, and that is probably good for digestion and nutrition.

Microwave cooking appears to be a good alternative for legume preparation, in terms of nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sproutnet.com/Nutrition/Research/nutritional_composition_and_anti.htm Nutritional composition and antinutritional factors of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) undergoing different cooking methods and germination]&lt;/ref&gt; It also has the advantage of being able to set a time, so you don't accidentally overcook them and turn them mushy.

===Adzuki (red) beans===
Used in Asian desserts. I sometimes use them in Indian style dals as well. These beans need more cooking than most - make sure you soak them overnight to make cooking easier. But it's been a long time, so I need to check I wasn't just doing something wrong (like adding salt too early). 

=== Chickpeas ===
(Also known as '''chick peas''' or '''garbanzo beans''')

One of the most versatile foods in vegetarian cooking. They go well in:

* Salads, soups and curries
* European cooking. Rosemary goes particularly well. 
* Middle-Eastern cuisine - nice with tagines and baharat. 
* Indian cuisine - delicious with a thick gravy-style curry (with lots of ground spices), or in a thin, soupy curry, using mango powder for sourness along with other spices. 

What chickpeas go well with:
* Rosemary
* Silverbeet, not spinach. My experience is that spinach&lt;ref name=&quot;spinach&quot;&gt;That's English spinach if you're Australian. Silverbeet (the big curled leaves with long white stems) is sometimes misnamed spinach in Australia. If you're Indonesian, spinach is NOT bayam, no matter what Popeye says - spinach has a different (nicer) taste. Bayam is Amaranth, which is not commonly available in Australian stores.&lt;/ref&gt; goes well with lentils, chickpeas with silverbeet, but not the other way around. This is my own taste, of course - you might disagree. 

The best tasting, nicest textured chick peas are the larger ones. They might cost twice as much, but if you've found a reasonably priced Indian shop,&lt;;ref&gt;It's worth comparing prices. Sometimes you'll find a shop that does its own importing and is much cheaper. There are about 5 Indian shops where I have been staying in Ashfield (Sydney) but one (The Indian Spice Warehouse) is the cheapest by a long way.&lt;/ref&gt;it's not too expensive. They often come in two sizes, with the larger ones something like 10&amp;nbsp;mm. 

[[#Soak|Soak]] for at least several hours. Overnight is good. However, if you soak them too long outside the fridge, especially in hot weather, there is a danger of food poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Off chick peas don't seem to affect everyone the same way - I know of a case where one person went to hospital, but other people were fine; I've also never had a problem in spite of eating chick peas that had started to ferment and smell bad (though they tasted good - as do many fermented foods)... but I will be careful in future.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split peas===
Considered a very low grade lentil by Indians; however, can make a tasty soup. Corn kernels go well. 

==Lentils==
===Vegetables with herbs &amp; lentils===
''Posted 17:01, 4 June 2006 (UTC)''

1&amp;nbsp;L microwave dish with lid or cover. Use the lid always, to prevent drying out. 

Sometime during the day, or just before you cook: put '''red lentils and/or split mung lentils''' in a cup - about 1/4 to 1/3 cup. Add water and leave to soak. ''Actually, you don't need to soak them, but I prefer to. You could just rinse them and put them in the container with water to easily cover them, if you prefer. In that case, microwave for about 2 minutes while you start chopping.''

Dice '''1 medium or 2 small carrots''', , microwave a minute or two while you
chop '''cauliflower''', smallish (2&amp;nbsp;cm or less), enough to nearly fill container, tuck in '''bay leaves''', 2, microwave 2-3 minutes. 

While that cooks, put spices in a bowl: '''salt''' 1/2 tsp; cracked pepper 1/4 tsp; '''1 Massell's beef stock cube''', or 1 tsp stock powder.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot;&gt;Massel is an Australian vegan stock cube with no flavor enhancers. Excellent flavor. Alternatively use a good quality stock powder or cube of your choice. Other amine flavors can be used as alternatives, such as Miso. Vegemite can be good in tiny quantities - a 1&amp;nbsp;L cooking dish should have no more than 1/4 tsp (to be verified - haven't used it for years). &lt;/ref&gt;

Pour spices into the cooking container - and the lentils, if you haven't added them yet. 

The veg in the bowl will have settled down a bit, leaving room for '''Japanese pumpkin'''&lt;ref name=&quot;JP&quot;&gt;Japanese pumpkin is softer and easier to cut, faster to cook, and generally sweeter and tastier than other pumpkins I've tried. If you use a different pumpkin, it will probably need more cooking&lt;/ref&gt; - take a slice (ooohhh... say 200g? As much as you can fit into the bowl) and cut into smallish pieces (1&amp;nbsp;cm avg). Also add half a '''Spanish onion'''&lt;ref name=&quot;SO&quot;&gt;the red or purple onions - sweeter, nicer flavor. They are the only onions I buy, when I have the choice.&lt;/ref&gt; and some '''1 sprig fresh thyme''',&lt;ref name=&quot;thyme&quot;&gt;Thyme is very strong. One sprig looks small, but in a meal for one or two people it's quite noticeable.&lt;/ref&gt; may  stripped, and any tiny branches chopped a bit. Add boiling water so liquid is about halfway up the side.

Microwave long enough to bring to the boil. If you have a very low setting on your microwave, set that to say 5 minutes. Or just wander off. I came back in about 15 minutes, and it was delicious. I ate with wholemeal toast. Served 2 big guys. If I'd cooked a larger amount, I could have eaten it on its own.

'''Variations''': 
*Cook less if you like your vegies firm, though reasonably soft is nicest in this dish. 
*Add chopped olives? But not really needed.

== Dal ==
'''Dal''' is the Indian word for lentils. This section is for the Indian recipes. 

Vegetables: Most will work well - though I'm not keen on carrots in Indian dal (they don't seem to work in my recipes, anyway). 


===Basic dal recipe===
A fairly standard approach that that works well for me is: 

Cook together: 
* 1 cup legumes, already soaked overnight and drained. Or soaked for an hour for the smaller split dals. Chana dal, toor dal, red lentils, mung or adzuki beans, or chick peas should all suit this recipe. 
* 3-4 cups water
* 1 T ground coriander
* 2 t ground cumin
* 2 t mango powder (adds sourness). 
* chilli (fresh, flakes or powder) to taste. 

When the legumes are soft enough to be ready to eat, add: 
* 2 t salt
* 2 t turmeric

Stir in, and continue to simmer. 

If you don't use mango powder, you can add tomato paste, or a tin of diced tomatoes after the legumes are soft. You can add other vegetables here if you want. (Silverbeet goes with chickpeas; English spinach goes with lentils, but not the other way around. I'm told that chana dal is traditionally cooked with vegetables from the gourd family - pumpkin goes particularly well. Other vegetables according to preference.)

Now, the next step is called ''tempering''. Take a frypan which has a lid (or find a cover). Heat to a moderate-high temperature. 

Add:
* ~1 T oil or ghee
* 1/2 t hing. Add a pinch to test that it sizzles, then add all. 
* mustard seeds - they start popping, 
* 2 branchlets of curry leaves
Keep covered while seeds pop. Shake or stir frypan. As the popping dies down, but before it gets too burnt, add the fried spices to the dal mixture. Stir well, taste, and adjust if necessary. 
For a more South Indian effect add at the very end: 
*1 tin coconut milk (or to taste) (optional). Add right at the end, rather than cooking it, to retain the flavor. 

Can be eaten with rice or Indian bread. Traditionally dals are made very thin an used as an accompaniment to other dishes and used to wet the rice. My preference is to eat it with a good quality wholemeal bread, or have on its own as a soup. 

Serve with natural yoghurt (i.e. plain, unsweetened). Perhaps try a chutney from your local Indian store.

Here's something that possibly appeals only to me: When reheating the next day, it may seem to have lost its zing. Add a drizzle of olive oil, and it will bring out the flavor of the spices in a quite unusual way. 

===Other flavor ideas===

* [http://food.aol.com/food/recipefinder.dyn?action=displayRecipe&amp;recipe_id=226762 Lentil Dal with Garlic-and-Cumin-Infused Oil] Very nice. I adapted this to my style, and what I had handy: I used half chana dal and half red lentils, and a bit less water; half clove of garlic and half a red onion, which I fried with the spices. To the spices I then added the salt and some eggplant and then zucchini, cooked them with the onions and spices till soft enough and browned; I used a bit more salt (1.5 tsp for a cup of dal) of which half went into the cooking spices and half into the dal (after it's soft); no fresh coriander; no lemon juice (forgot). I ended by adding the spice-onion-veg mixture to the dal, followed by the chopped fresh tomato, mixed in, and turned off the heat. Leave for 2 minutes or so and serve. 

=== Chana dal ===
Chana dal has the lowest [[wikipedia:glycemic index|glycemic index]] of any food, last I looked. But it has a much greater advantage: it's delicious. Seriously. 

It takes more cooking than other dals. However, if you soak it for a few hours, it can cook with as little as 20 minutes of simmering (depending on the batch, and how old it is - so if you're not sure, allow at least an hour of cooking to be on the safe side). 

Vegetables: Traditionally eaten with gourds - the family that includes pumpkin, zucchini, and bitter melon. Superb with pumpkin. Bitter melon is delicious ''if'' you acquire the taste (it's seriously bitter). (It took me about 10 minutes to acquire the taste, which makes me wonder if it contains something addictive.) 

==== Chana dal with panch phoran and pumpkin ====
[[Wikipedia:Panch phoran|Panch phoran]] is a bengali spice mix. I make my own up, and leave out the fenugreek (which is bitter). Something like:
3 parts mustard
3 parts cumin
3 parts fennel
1 part nigella (black cumin). Some use a kind of onion seed instead. 

For every cup of uncooked dal, I use 8 tsp of panch phoran. I fry this with hing and curry leaves (optional), and perhaps 2 to 4 tsp coriander, and perhaps ground fenugreek (1 tsp?) for a couple of minutes, so that the mustard pops, but being careful not to burn it.&lt;ref name=&quot;burn&quot;&gt;If you do burn it:If it's burnt a lot, and smoking terribly, throw the spices out and start again. If it's burnt a bit, and smells burnt but it's not completely black, then you might risk it, and it might taste good. Tell your guests that it's a special recipe, with an overtone of burnt &quot;tandoori&quot; flavor.&lt;/ref&gt; then add onion, and add to the cooked dal mixture. The result is a dal that's full of cooked seeds - more exotic that you'll find in a standard Indian restaurant. 

Use a bit of chilli, to taste.

''trying tonight - a huge pot with 4 cups chana dal &amp; pumpkin. Spices start with 8 tsp ea cumin &amp; fennel, 6tsp mustard, and 3 tsp nigella... update later. '' --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] &amp;middot; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Singkong2005|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 10:51, 8 November 2006 (UTC). ''Missing something, better with coconut milk. Using ghee instead of oil would help. Forgot to adjust sourness - will add lemon juice to leftovers...'' --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] &amp;middot; &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Singkong2005|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 09:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

==== Chana dal with pumpkin and sage ====
This is my own invention. I know that sage and pumpkin ravioli is delicious (having bought some in Haberfield, a suburb of Sydney with many Italian shops). And I know that chana dal goes very well with pumpkin. So with a bit of creativity and a bit of guesswork, I tried this - and loved it. 

* 1 cup dal
Rinse, soak dal for a few hours. Drain, add 1.5 L boiling water, then simmer for 20 minutes. 

While it simmers, prepare:
*500 g Japanese/Kent pumpkin (more or less, to taste). (Other pumpkins will work more or less well... I stick to Japanese.)

Check the dal for softness. Chana dal won't go mushy like other dals, but it should be very soft and smooth when tasted.

When soft, add the pumpkin, and salt:
*1-2 tsp salt (more or less, depending how much pumpkin you used, and whether you follow one of those awful low-sodium diets. Another teaspoon is added to the onion in the final stage.)

Bring back to a simmer. Now prepare the remaining ingredients:
*1 medium onion, chopped, preferably Spanish (purple) onion.
*2 tsp fresh sage, chopped. (Up to 3 tsp, according to taste. If you use dried sage, the usual advice is to use half as much, though I haven't tried it.) 
*1/2 tsp cracked or ground black pepper
*2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
*1 tsp salt

Once the pumpkin is soft, start cooking this final herb-onion mix. 

Heat the oil in a frypan over moderate heat. Don't let it smoke. Add the onion, stir, and add the sage and pepper. Cover the frypan and turn down - this can keep some of the natural moisture in, and reduce the need for extra oil. Stir regularly, and when translucent, add 1 tsp salt. Stir for a minute, add to the soup.

Serve with a good wholemeal or rye bread. 

(You may wish to mash some of the pumpkin with the back of the mixing spoon, in order to give the soup a thicker texture. You can do this while waiting for the onions to cook.)


'''Variations:''' Chilli instead of pepper; stock instead of water.

''Note - the chana dal will remain separate, but become soft. If they break down and make a very thick soup, you've probably been sold the wrong thing: i.e. split peas. They look similar, but are very different to cook and taste. If this happens... add extra water as needed, then write and tell me if split pea soup with pumpkin and sage is nice.''

===Spicy mung dal===
Mung is the small, round green legumes used in Asian desserts and for making mung bean sprouts. Indians tend to use split mung; I prefer the whole dal. Sometimes they use a smaller variety for spicy food and the larger one for sweets (I think...?) but I haven't figured out whether that's necessary - I use the standard larger one and it works fine. 

When cooking with mung, I use a larger amount of spices. 

See also the recipe for [[#kolak|kolak]], below.

===Adzuki (red) beans===

Mkes an interesting change. Goes well with pumpkin and sweet potato; spanish onion (the purple one) goes well, fried with the spices. I have cooked this with mustard, cumin and turmeric (pretty standard) plus some coriander powder and some of the &quot;sweeter&quot; spices such as cinnamon, fennel (or star anise), cloves &amp; cardamom. It turned out pretty well. Be careful to use a tiny amount of cloves &amp; cardamom. I'll post a proper recipe one day.

== Bean salads ==
Extra virgin olive oil,&lt;ref name=&quot;OO&quot;&gt;Olive oil here ALWAYS refers to ''extra virgin'' olive oil, which is the first pressing, unprocessed, with all the flavor of the olive. I find that country of origin is the biggest factor in the taste. Personally I prefer Spanish, which has a slightly fruity flavor and aroma. I don't find a lot of difference between brands of Spanish olive oil - a generic brand is fine.&lt;/ref&gt; balsamic vinegar, a little salt, chilli pepper or black pepper, and some kind of salad or vegetable, are key ingredients for a great salad. If you've got fresh herbs such as basil, that can work. 

I haven't used black beans before, but otherwise this is similar to what I do: [http://www.recipezaar.com/53114 '''Black White and Red Bean Salad''']. I usually add a bit less oil, and more balsamic vinegar. And I use about 1/2 tsp of salt per 16-ounce/44 g tin of beans, (assuming you're not adding salt through in the sun-dried tomatoes or whatever). 

I often have a bean salad as a meal for breakfast or lunch. They're quite high in protein, and not excessive in carbohydrates - that's good to help stay alert during the day, without going overboard on protein, Atkins-diet style. &lt;!--Check this: Chick peas, kidney beans and butter beans are particularly high in protein... (I think canellini, the white beans, are not as high.)--&gt;

These are some examples I came up with, but use your imagination. 

Each provides one large serve, or two serves if with (wholemeal) bread or toast.

===Chickpeas with eggplant and thyme===
''Posted 17:01, 4 June 2006 (UTC)''

Use a chunk of eggplant about the size of the tin of chickpeas. Dice in 1&amp;nbsp;cm pieces. microwave, covered, 4 minutes or till soft. 

Drain&lt;ref name=&quot;D&quot;&gt;If the liquid is thick and gluggy, I pierce the bottom partway around with a tin opener, open the other end, and run water through.&lt;/ref&gt; a 440&amp;nbsp;g tin Italian&lt;ref name=&quot;I&quot;&gt;Italian legume products are better quality and often cheaper than local ones, in Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; chickpeas, add to eggplant in a bowl. Mix in 1/2 tsp salt, '''1 sprig fresh thyme''',&lt;ref name=&quot;thyme&quot; /&gt; stripped and chopped, 1/4 tsp cracked pepper. Add 1-2 tsp extra virgin olive oil&lt;ref name=&quot;OO&quot; /&gt; and 2-4tsp balsamic vinegar. Stir, and eat.

==Eggs==
I don't use a lot of eggs, but I always use free range when I do. That doesn't solve all the animal welfare issues, but it's an improvement. 

The ideal is having your own chickens, or buying from someone you know. Cage chickens have a hard life, it seems to me. 

==Aston's egg surprise==
serves 1
I interrogated Aston after he made a delicious egg thing... and this is his memory (and estimates of quantity)
* 4 eggs
* 1/2 cup plum wine (I imagine sweet sherry or verjuice&lt;ref&gt;Verjuice is unfermented juice of wine grapes. Much nicer than actual wine, in my opinion. But it's ridiculously expensive (a friend in Sydney paid $10 for a half-wine bottle, 375 ml).&lt;/ref&gt; would be a good alternative. 
* 2 pinches of salt
* seaweed
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1 sheet seaweed (the one used for sushi)
* pinch chilli (or to taste)
* 1 rounded tsp peach conserve
* about 100 ml leftover veg mix (cooked with turmeric &amp; yellow bean sauce... the recipe for that is coming soon...)

Beat egg (with fork). 

Mix conserve and wine (shake or stir thoroughly together) and add to eggs, and mix. 

Add seaweed, salt and chilli flakes, mix. 

Cook in frypan - standard scrambled egg method. When eggs have solidified, but still soft, mix in 

Serve with: 1/2 bunch spinach&lt;ref name=&quot;spinach&quot; /&gt; and 2 tomatoes, cooked with 4 tsp yellow bean sauce &amp; a dash of sesame oil. I would have liked an extra pinch of salt, but this was quite a good accompaniment as it was...

==Spice mixes==
*[http://www.copykat.com/component/option,com_rapidrecipe/page,viewrecipe/recipe_id,672/  Old Bay Seasoning] (CopyKat.com) - could be interesting. However, [[Wikipedia:Old Bay Seasoning]] seems different, incl ginger, but no cloves mentioned.

==Bread: Toast &amp; sandwiches==
Always use a good quality wholemeal bread. Bread is cheap, relative to other foodstuff, so spending even $4 for a good quality loaf of bread is well worth it. I love Helgas and Noble Rise wholemeal loaves (in Australia), and you get quite a few meals from one of these large loaves. If you can make good bread yourself in a breadmaker, that's a great option. I haven't had consistent results, so I'm happy to pay a few dollars for a nice bread. 

I'll occasionally use butter, but usually I take a spoon of extra virgin olive oil and drizzle it over the bread. 

Quantity: I find that more than two slices of bread makes me sleepy (due to the carbohydrates), so I make sure there's plenty of healthy vegetables as filling, or some other bulky, filling food, like soup. 

Ideas for ingredients: 
*Thinly sliced (0.5&amp;nbsp;cm or less) pumpkin, cooked slowly in a little olive oil, in a covered frypan. I'll generally add the pumpkin seeds around the side - cooked slowly like this, they turn out delicious (serve with a sprinkle of Massel's stock powder or salt, and/or paprika and cracked pepper). 
*Savory peanut butter - best on a slice toast. Peanut butter&lt;ref&gt;Use a good peanut butter, with ''only'' peanuts, no sugar. Salt is fine; oil isn't necessary, but not a big problem. A health food store or bulk food store might be your best bet for freshly ground roasted peanuts. Failing that, the supermarket's health food section might give something acceptable.&lt;/ref&gt; with cracked pepper and herbs (dried mixed herbs, or fresh thyme works well). Paprika is an option. A sprinkle of salt if there's none in the peanut butter. (It will be quite dry, unless you've got something like salt and herbs to make your mouth water. The other option is to add olive oil, but go easy - that's getting to be an oily meal).  

Jam, conserve or honey as a filling is fine, if you regard it as a dessert. --03:00, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

==Sweets==
===Not your average jam on toast===
Something simple like jam, conserve or honey on toast, with butter, can satisfy the need for something sweet and tasty. To make it special, try something unusual:
*Basil goes well with dark fruits. E.g. strawberry, raspberry or plum conserve - break up some basil leaves on top of the butter, then spread the conserve. '''Note:''' The best basil for this is the basil you find at Vietnamese grocery stores and restaurants. It's a flat-leaf basil, like Thai basil, but without such a strong aniseed flavor, and is delicious but not overpowering even with a full layer of leaves on the bread. It also grows very easily.&lt;ref&gt;Take some basil home from the restaurant or grocery store, cut the bottom of the stem off, leave it in water for a few days, then plant it, with adequate light and water. Pinch flowers off as they appear - once it flowers, it will die. If you cut it back very hard before winter, and the climate is mild, it may even last an extra year.&lt;/ref&gt; If you can't get this one, then try ordinary basil, but use a tiny bit and see how you like it.
*Lemon basil&lt;ref&gt;Lemon basil is used with fried duck or fish in Indonesia, where it's known as ''kemangi''. In Australia it's possible to get it in &quot;Gourmet variety basil&quot; (or something like that) seed packets, but it seems to grow slowly outside the tropics, so it will need attention. I've never seen the leaves sold in Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; goes well with a wider variety of fruits &amp; conserves, including not only the dark fruits, but also apricot. Use sparingly, leaves broken into smaller pieces. --03:00, 16 June 2006 (UTC)

===Kolak===
My ex was a lousy cook when we were married. Now she's a great cook. &quot;Not fair, huh?&quot; she says. She does a version of the Indonesian kolak that I really like - it's got less sugar, and as a result the pumpkin and sweet potato stand out for their sweetness. The Indonesian version is sweeter, and making the pumpkin in particular taste bland and out of place - but that's just my opinion. 

*mung, cooked till soft
*water
*sugar to taste. Best to add too little, early on, and adjust towards the end. You can keep the liquid only slightly sweet, and it will be a healthy food to indulge in without nausea or guilt; or add more if you want a more traditional sweet dessert to be eaten more sparingly.  
*coconut cream/milk - one or two tins in a big saucepan should be fine. Add at very end for the best flavor (unless you're in a third world country using freshly squeezed coconut milk made with unsafe water). 
*pinch salt, perhaps?
*pumpkin (a ripe, sweet pumpkin with a good orange color. A good Japanese pumpkin is nice and sweet).
*sweet potato
*banana (or plantain if available)
*pandan leaf (pandan) - Optional. In Sydney these are available from Indian shops, fresh in the fridge. Add a couple of leaves at beginning... I guess.

Can't remember what else... Jackfruit is sometimes used in Indonesia. Boiled cassava root is also added, which I think is disgusting. 

Instructions: cook. :) Obviously put slow cooking things in first, such as mung, then sweet potato, then pumpkin. 

There's no fixed rules. Don't overdo the mung, though - it's usually watery in consistency, with mung mostly at the bottom.

It is served hot (especially if freshly cooked) or cold.

==Foods I want to learn about==
Moussaka, Ratatouille, corn bread, felafel, 

Amit suggested I try tandoori paneer&lt;ref name=&quot;paneer&quot;&gt;Paneer is an Indian cheese, sometimes compared to cottage cheese, but firmer&lt;/ref&gt; - made with this [http://www.chicken.ca/DefaultSite/index_e.aspx?DetailID=498 Tandoori chicken recipe], substituting paneer for chicken. Marinate overnight, or in the morning, before cooking at night. 

===Soba===
I recently had [[Cookbook:Soba|Soba]] noodles (made from buckwheat) at a Japanese restaurant and they were delicious! One dish was hot, another was just cold noodles with a dipping sauce - which would be wonderful in summer. Must learn to cook this... watch this space.

===Using peanuts===
Over the years I've had these delicious things made with peanuts: 
* Wonderful sate (satay) sauce in Indonesian food stalls, ground on the spot from roast peanuts, and raw garlic, onion, &amp; chilli, with ''kecap manis'' (sweet soy sauce) and salt. 
* &quot;Chicken and groundnut curry&quot; - an African recipe, which I helped make for a charity event. Wish I had the recipe. Thinking about a vegetarian version.
* Sweet peanut soup, as a hot dessert at a Chinese restaurant. My father knew the manager, and I occasionally got treated to things that weren't on the English menu... 

===Other suggestions?===
Can you suggest any other vegetarian cuisines...? I know there's plenty of vegetarian options in Indian and Middle-Eastern cooking, Thai has quite a few vegetarian options, and Indonesian, though mostly a minefield for vegetarians, does have wonderful things like baby jackfruit (in gudeg and lodeh). Vietnamese vegetarian food is better than the meat version, according to some accounts I've read (as it's fresher). But what else? Please enlighten me - [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Singkong2005&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new leave a note on my talk page].

==A great place to search==
[http://www.foodieview.com '''foodie view'''] which is a ''fantastic'', handy site for recipe searches, which gives the highest rated recipes first. This is where I found Varsha's recipes and comments (above).

I have a [http://www.foodieview.com/recipebox/Singkong2005 recipe box] which contains recipes I've bookmarked, for reference. It doesn't mean I endorse the recipe - I haven't tried most of them yet. 

I'm looking for an actual recipe site to post my recipes - I'll wait and see what the upcoming [http://communipes.com Communipes] is like before I decide on one. I've been in touch with one of the developers (on 13 July 06), and he said it's coming soon and is going to be very snazzy. Other options: [http://allrecipes.com/ Allrecipes] looks good.

[http://beanslentils.com Beans and Lentils] has some useful stuff (preparation tips, etc), &amp; [http://www.google.com/base/search?a_n0=recipes&amp;scoring=ld&amp;a_y0=9&amp;a_s0=0&amp;a_r=1 Google Base] could be worth a look, but neither seem as good as foodie view. 

I probably won't contribute much to the Wikibooks [[Cookbook]], as it's trying to be a textbook. I want creativity. And comments, and voting.

==Measurements==

{|
|tsp (or t)|| = ||teaspoon
|-
|Tbls (or T)&amp;nbsp;|| = ||tablespoon
|-
|cup|| = ||250 ml
|}

You should know the volume of your cooking containers - I often use this as a guide to amounts, e.g. I give the amounts of spices to use for a 2 L cooking pot/dish that's almost full. Note: it's almost full at the end of cooking, so if you put all the raw ingredients in at once, it would be much more than 2 L.

If you're American... well, it's about time you learnt the metric system ;). If there's a good conversion page, put the link here, thanks.

There is no need at all, as far as I can see, to swap one very common system of notation for one used only a fraction of the time and which has proven controversial almost everywhere where it has been introduced to the general public. If you do this again, you will be blocked. On the other hand, if you would like to assist in improving the book, bearing in mind its target audience of 8 to 12 year olds, that would be welcome. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 19:48, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

:The system I am reverting to is the most common system in use for text books and other academic texts, and is generally preferred in general usage, and was originally used by the book's authors. Abuse of administrator powers to gain an advantage in content disputes is frowned upon, I believe. Kind regards. [[User:65.115.220.89|65.115.220.89]] 20:04, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

First, that is untrue. A straightforward google search, for example, would show that what I said is correct. Secondly, you were warned that if you made the same adjustment again, you would be blocked. I have therefore blocked you for three days - please do not repeat this. You may, in the meantime, discuss the issue, if you so wish, on this, your usertalk page. Thirdly, since you appear familiar with wiki ways, you will understand that suddenly appearing on a wiki and making edits as an anonymous user, and then continuously remaking them when they are reverted is likely to end in a block of some sort. Please desist. If you wish to help write textbooks, that is ok - what you have done today, however, is just plain disruptive. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:10, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Flag of Alaska.svg|200px|thumb|The state flag of Alaska]]
Alaska is a [[Wikijunior:North America/United States|U.S.]] state, located on the northwest tier of [[Wikijunior:North America|North America]]. It is by far the largest state in area, but one of the least populated. It is the 49th state, having been admitted to the Union on January 3, 1959. The name &quot;Alaska&quot; is most likely derived from the Aleut Alyeska, meaning &quot;great country&quot;, &quot;mainland&quot; or &quot;great land&quot;.

[[Image:Map_of_USA_highlighting_Alaska.png|200px|thumb|Alaska's location at the northwestern point of North America]]
==History==
The first European contact with Alaska occurred in the year 1741, when Vitus Bering, a European explorer, led an expedition for the Russian Navy aboard the St. Peter. After his crew returned to [[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]] bearing sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, other fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia towards the Aleutian islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.  New Archangel on Kodiak Island was Alaska's first capital, but for a century under both [[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]] and the [[Wikijunior:North America/United States|U.S.]], Sitka was the capital. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. William H. Seward, the U.S. Secretary of State, negotiated the Alaskan purchase in 1867 for $7.2 million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military for years, and was unofficially a territory of the United States from 1884 on.

In the 1890s, gold rushes in Alaska and the nearby Yukon Territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to Alaska. Alaska was granted official territorial status in 1912. At this time the capital was moved to Juneau.

==Geography==
Alaska is one of the two U.S. states not bordered by another state, [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Hawaii|Hawaii]] being the other. It is the only non-contiguous state in North America; about 500 miles (800 km) of Canadian territory separate Alaska from [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Washington|Washington]]. It is also the only mainland state whose capital city is accessible only by ship or air. No roads connect Juneau to the rest of the state.

It is bordered by [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/Yukon Territory|Yukon Territory]] and [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/British Colombia|British Columbia]], [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada|Canada]] to the east, the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west, and the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaska is the largest state by area in the United States. It is larger in area than all but 18 of the world's nations.

Alaska is the largest state in the United States in terms of land area at 570,374 square miles (1,477,261 km²), over twice as large as [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Texas|Texas]], the next largest state. If a map of Alaska settled upon a map of the Continental United States, Alaska would overlap Texas, [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Oklahoma|Oklahoma]], [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Kansas|Kansas]], [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Colorado|Colorado]], and if the state's westernmost point were superimposed on San Francisco, [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/California|California]], its easternmost point would be in Jacksonville, [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Florida|Florida]]. Alaska also has more coastline than all of the contiguous U.S. combined.

One scheme for describing the state's geography is by labeling the regions:

*South Central Alaska is the southern coastal region and contains most of the state's population. Anchorage and many growing towns, such as Palmer, and Wasilla, lie within this area. Petroleum industrial plants, transportation, tourism, and two military bases form the core of the economy here. 
*The Alaska Panhandle, also known as Southeast Alaska, is home to many of Alaska's larger towns including Juneau, tidewater glaciers and extensive forests. Tourism, fishing, forestry and state government anchor the economy. 
*The Alaska Interior is home to Fairbanks. The geography is marked by large braided rivers, such as the Yukon River and the Kuskokwim River, as well as Arctic tundra lands and shorelines. 
*The Alaskan Bush is the remote, less crowded part of the state, encompassing 380 native villages and small towns such as Nome, Bethel, Kotzebue and, most famously, Barrow, the northernmost town in the United States. 

The northeast corner of Alaska is covered by the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which covers 19,049,236 acres (79,318 km²).

With its numerous islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (54,700 km) of tidal shoreline. The island chain extending west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula is called the Aleutian Islands. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians. For example, Unimak Island is home to Mount Shishaldin, a moderately active volcano that rises to 9,980 ft (3,042 m) above sea level. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland.

North America's second largest tides occur in Turnagain Arm just south of Anchorage, which often sees tidal differences of more than 35 feet (10.7 m).

Alaska is home to 3.5 million lakes of 20 acres (8 ha) or larger. Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188,320 square miles (487,747 km², mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands. Frozen water, in the form of glacier ice, covers some 16,000 square miles (41,440 km²) of land and 1,200 square miles (3,108 km²) of tidal zone. The Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon, Canada, covers 2,250 square miles (5,827 km²) alone.

The Aleutian Islands cross longitude 180°, so Alaska can be considered the easternmost state as well as the westernmost. Alaska and, especially, the Aleutians are one of the extreme points of the United States. The International Date Line jogs west of 180° to keep the whole state, and thus the entire continental United States, within the same legal day.

According to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. federal government as national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges. Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 million acres (350,000 km²), or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

Of the remaining land area, the State of Alaska owns 24.5%; another 10% is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling less than 1%.

Alaska is divided into &quot;boroughs,&quot; instead of &quot;counties.&quot; The function is the same, but whereas most states use a three-tiered system of decentralisation - state/county/township - Alaska only uses two tiers - state/borough. Owing to the state's low population density, most of the land is located in the Unorganized Borough which, as the name implies, has no intermediate borough government of its own, but is administered directly by the state government.

For purposes of the federal census, the state is also divided into a number of artificial divisions defined geographically by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only.

==People==
According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 70% of single-race Alaska residents were Caucasian and 16% were Native American or Alaska Native. Multiracial/Mixed-Race people are the third largest group of people in the state, totaling 7% of the population.

86% of Alaska residents aged 5 and older speak [[Wikijunior:Languages/English|English]] at home. The next most common languages are [[Wikijunior:Languages/Spanish|Spanish]], Yupik, Tagalog, and Iñupiaq.
==State Symbols==
*The State Bird is the Willow Ptarmigan.
*The State Fossil is the Woolly Mammoth.
*The State Tree is the Sitka Spruce.
*The State Mineral is Gold.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book addresses issues related to TAO CORBA development and integration.

First, a word or two about the nature of open source projects. The main benefit of an open source project is that you get a working product you can use, complete with community support. This support often takes the form of user's support as well as developer support. Ideally, these support avenues also include documentation. Should the open source project in question lack some of the pieces mentioned above, its utility as an open source product (particularly as the product becomes more complex) is necessarily diminished.

ACE+TAO is a wonderful product which compares well to other open source products like Orbit or Mico. It encompasses much of the current standard and comes complete with all the services you would expect (and some extras too). Unfortunately, except for the most basic services (the naming service) there are precious few documented programming examples in their tutorial. While there are several source files in the examples directory, these are sadly not written with documented code (often without even a header describing the use for the example), and certainly not included in any web page explaining their code or use.

Object Computing, Inc. freely provides the [http://download.ociweb.com/TAO-1.4a/TAO1.4aGettingStarted.pdf Getting Started] chapter of their [http://www.theaceorb.com/purchase/index.html TAO Developer's Guide] (that can be purchased for around $20.00).  This chapter is complete with code examples and walks the user through the steps needed to make a simple TAO client and server.  The open-source TAO 1.4a distribution contains all examples referenced in the TAO Developer's Guide, while the [http://www.theaceorb.com/faq/index.html FAQ] contains some helpful information for beginners and experts alike.

Remedy IT provides freely the [https://osportal.remedy.nl/projects/rite-tpg TAO Programmers Guide].

Additionally, the [news:comp.soft-sys.ace comp.soft-sys.ace] and [news:comp.object.corba comp.object.corba] newsgroups are monitored by groups and individuals able to field questions related to both TAO and CORBA, and the TAO [http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html mailing lists] are available for questions, discussion, and reporting bugs related to TAO.

The following sections should expand on the single example provided with ACE+TAO (the quoter example) with sections designed to help the user with the event service, the notification service, and other real-time issues. Those reading this page wishing to make contributions in explaining various pieces of the TAO project are encouraged to make contributions to this page.

== Build Instructions ==

* http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DOC_ROOT/TAO/TAO-INSTALL.html
* http://www.theaceorb.com/faq/index.html#HowToBuildACEandTAOonWindows



The only caveat is that you want to be careful with the &quot;traditional build under a UNIX environment. It treats the install target dir as a sandbox it owns, so if you have chosen /usr/local, like you would with a typical automake project, understand that if there is a problem with the build, the last thing the traditional build env will do is to delete its sandbox (/usr/local). 

The newer versions of ACE+TAO, V5.6.7 (mini-release), in theory now support automake style builds. In fact, for the first time, you can do the &quot;configure; make; make install&quot; dance and it just works! There are some annoying problems that have yet to be cleared up. As of this version, the -ORBDaemon switch doesn't work to send the distributions daemons into the background.

On the other hand, if you like a no fuss option,  Ken Sedgwick over at bonsai.com has provided pre-built RPMs. The binaries provided aren't of the debug variety, so they don't take up the shocking amount of space an installation of ACE+TAO build with -g can. The bummer seems to be that the number of compiled in features seems to be a little light. That being said, its certainly a good way to get started, and will handle 90% of your applications.
== Build Instructions on Linux ==
To make installing all of TAO easier use the following script. It will take a lot of time to build so using a script is a good option. The script can also be modified to compile only the necessary TAO features.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash 
echo &quot;Usage: sudo ./INSTALL-ACE+TAO-6.1.2.sh [INSTALL-DIR]&quot;; 
echo &quot;best to put it in /opt&quot; 
ACETAO=ACE+TAO-6.1.2 
# To change to the latest available install change the ACETAO
# Tested and works with UBUNTU 10.04 and 12.04
if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then 
	INSTALL_DIR=$1; 
	else 
	INSTALL_DIR=~/; 
fi 
# check if script is run as root! 
echo &quot;default run sudo ./INSTALL-ACE+TAO-6.1.2.sh ~/&quot;; 
echo &quot;Tested with Ubuntu-but in theory work on all linux! NJOY !&quot;; 

# go to $INSTALL_DIR to install ACE+TAO into 
cd $INSTALL_DIR; 

# download ACE+TAO to current directory 
echo &quot;Download: wget http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/previous_versions/$ACETAO.tar.gz&quot;; 
wget http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/previous_versions/$ACETAO.tar.gz 
if [ &quot;$?&quot; -ne 0 ]; then echo &quot;ERROR: download failed!&quot;; exit 1; fi 

# rm possible former installation 
rm -rf ACE_wrappers; 
rm -rf $ACETAO; 

# extract archive 
echo &quot;UNTAR: tar -xzf $ACETAO.tar.gz&quot;; 
tar -xzf $ACETAO.tar.gz 
if [ &quot;$?&quot; -ne 0 ]; then echo &quot;ERROR: extraction failed!&quot;; exit 1; fi 

# set environment variables 
cd ACE_wrappers; 
echo &quot;export ACE_ROOT=$PWD&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc 
source ~/.bashrc 
echo &quot;export TAO_ROOT=$ACE_ROOT/TAO&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc 
echo &quot;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ACE_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc 
cd $ACE_ROOT; 
source ~/.bashrc 
# create config.h file 
echo &quot;Config.h create--- $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h&quot; 
echo &quot;#include &lt;ace/config-linux.h&gt;&quot; &gt; $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h 
echo &quot;&quot; &gt;&gt; $ACE_ROOT/ace/config.h 

# create platform_macros.GNU file 
echo &quot;create platform_macros.GNU for linux--$ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU&quot;; 
echo &quot;INSTALL_PREFIX = /usr/local&quot; &gt; $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU 
echo &quot;include \$(ACE_ROOT)/include/makeinclude/platform_linux.GNU&quot; &gt;&gt; $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU 
echo &quot;&quot; &gt;&gt; $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude/platform_macros.GNU 

# compile ace kernel 
cd $ACE_ROOT/ace; 
make; 
if [ &quot;$?&quot; -ne 0 ]; then echo &quot;FAILED to compile $ACE_ROOT/ace!&quot;; exit 1; fi 

# compile gperf 
cd $ACE_ROOT/apps/gperf; 
make; 
if [ &quot;$?&quot; -ne 0 ]; then echo &quot;FAILED to compile $ACE_ROOT/apps/gperf!&quot;; exit 1; fi 
 
cd $ACE_ROOT/ace; 
make install; 
if [ &quot;$?&quot; -ne 0 ]; then echo &quot;FAILED to install $ACE_ROOT/ace!&quot;; exit 1; fi 

# compile TAO 
cd $TAO_ROOT; 
make; 
if [ &quot;$?&quot; -ne 0 ]; then echo &quot;FAILED to compile $TAO_ROOT/TAO!&quot;; exit 1; fi 

echo &quot;&quot;; 
echo &quot;ACE+TAO successfully installed!!!&quot;; 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Things to check after install ===
After completing the bulding of the TAO it is important to check if everything is done correctly, Hence run the &quot;tests&quot; available in ACE and TAO to check.
If the system is built in Linux then the Naming service is not available by default, but the functionallity is provided by '''tao-cosnaming''' just like the IDL build is given by '''tao-idl'''. you can create a softlink for NamingService with tao_cosnaming by using 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;ln -s tao_cosnaming Naming_Service &lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

'''Steps'''
# Run the tests (ACE_wrappers/tests and ACE_wrappers/TAO/tests)
# check all the links for the binaries (tao_idl, tao_cosnaming.. etc)
# Start with the examples 
:Present in 2 locations just runing  then playing around with them is a great start
:#ACE_wrappers/TAO/DevGuideExamples/ and 
:#ACE_wrappers/TAO/Examples/

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Preface =

This section describes how to create a simple server similar to the quoter example in the TAO examples ('''ACE_wrappers/TAO/examples/Quoter''').&lt;br&gt;
To get this to work, create the IDL file and run the tao_idl executable on that file. The command line looks like the following:

&lt;pre&gt;tao_idl -GI basic.idl&lt;/pre&gt;

This generates a whole host of source files, only one or two of which you will be required to edit.

= Source File main.cpp =
&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include &lt;config.h&gt;
#endif

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &quot;basicI.h&quot;
#include &quot;basicC.h&quot;
#include &quot;ace/streams.h&quot;

using namespace std;
using namespace CORBA;

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
    // First initialize the ORB, that will remove some arguments...
    ORB_var orb = ORB_init(argc, argv, &quot;ORB&quot; /* the ORB name, it can be anything! */);
    Object_var poa_object = orb-&gt;resolve_initial_references(&quot;RootPOA&quot;);
    PortableServer::POA_var poa = PortableServer::POA::_narrow(poa_object.in());
    PortableServer::POAManager_var poa_manager = poa-&gt;the_POAManager();
    poa_manager-&gt;activate();

    // Create the servant
    My_Factory_i my_factory_i;

    // Activate it to obtain the object reference
    My_Factory_var my_factory = my_factory_i._this();

    // Put the object reference as an IOR string
    String_var ior = orb-&gt;object_to_string (my_factory.in());
    // Print it out!
    //Note: You will be using this reference in the client to get it to connect to this server
    //Don't even bother copying it down, it changes with each invocation &amp; is as long as your arm
    cout &lt;&lt; ior.in() &lt;&lt; endl;
    //By default, the following doesn't return unless there is an error
    orb-&gt;run();

    // Destroy the POA, waiting until the destruction terminates
    poa-&gt;destroy(1, 1);
    orb-&gt;destroy();
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

= Source file basic.idl =
Running the tao_idl program against the following source, generates all the files you'll need to generate a simple server. The actual command line should be 'tao_idl -GI basic.idl' The command line option '-GI' is to generate the server related interface file listed below. All you need to do is to implement this file (i.e. fill out some of the empty member functions) and you're off to the races.
&lt;source lang=&quot;idl&quot;&gt;
// Forward declare
interface Widget;

interface My_Factory
{
    // = TITLE
    //   A factory class for the widget interfaces

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the most critical parts of moving from your notes to a finished paper is '''Organization'''.  This chapter will help you develop your notes into a first draft paper.

== Outline ==

Once you have approximately 40% of your research completed, and you are sure of your topic, you should begin assembling an outline.  How do you know when you have 40% of your research completed?  Take the number of pages the final draft of the paper is supposed to be, and multiply that by 3.5.  This represents the approximate number of paragraphs your paper should have in it.  Each of those paragraphs needs at least two, and preferably three details in it.  Those details must come from your research.

An outline's purpose is to determine where the individual pieces of research should go, and in what order.  Ideally, related pieces of information should go together.  If you are doing research on the history of seige warfare, you should not jump from the Persian seige of Amida to the seige of Vicksburg to the seige of Stalingrad and back again in the same paragraph.  Instead, each of those major themes should be a separate group of paragraphs.  Perhaps you will arrange them in historical order, with Amida coming first and Stalingrad last.  Perhaps you will apply the lessons of Amida and Vicksburg to Stalingrad.  Perhaps you will begin with Stalingrad before flashing back to Vicksburg and Amida. 

You can always shuffle the different parts of your outline around, but it is helpful to have an idea of what details belong in which portion of the paper.  The early drafts of your outline will also help you see where the research you have already done fits, and what portions of your paper are weak.

===Details, Details ===

Details come in four basic types for many research papers.  The first are date/event synchronicities:  ''In 146 BCE, the Romans destroyed Carthage utterly.''  The second type is a location/date/data synchronicity: ''By 100 CE, the Romans had stationed 15 legions along the Rhine.''  The third type of detail is a definition: ''Latifundias were large slave-run plantations in Roman-ruled Italy.''  The fourth type of detail is a direct quotation from one of your research sources, along with a date and location: ''In 46 BCE, Julius Caesar promised the Senate, &quot;This will be the last year of confusion,&quot; when he instituted the Julian calendar.''

Each of your details should be backed up with appropriate citations, whether these be footnotes, parenthetical notes, endnotes, or other attributions, from the source materials you are using.

=== Defining a Narrative ===

Whether you use Harvard Notation or some other system for writing the outline of your paper, you should make some progress toward '''defining your narrative''' by the time you have 60% of your research completed.  Research papers should have some kind of underlying story they wish to tell, whether that be the results of the War of the Spanish Succession, or the consequences of the Treaty of Westphalia. 

Your story should support the thesis, but you will impress your history teacher, and likely earn a higher grade, if you are doing more than merely reciting a laundry list of facts and figures.

==== What is the Story? ====

==== Introducing Your Work ====

A research paper should open with an introduction. This is an extremely important part of your work. It provides the reader with some understanding of what will follow. Introductions help form perceptions of written texts, and most readers will think more highly of your work if it is well introduced.

This is the hardest part of your writing, though producing a good introduction is helped through having an understanding of what it should contain. Firstly, it should outline the parameters of your work, such as the dates of the period studied, the geographical remit of the paper, and the basic subject matter of what you will be studying. Secondly, and more importantly, you should briefly introduce your thesis. This should only be done in the broadest terms in the introduction, and will be developed further in the body of your work.

In terms of length, an introduction should be approximately 10% of the final length of the paper.

== Quotation Files ==

Thanks to modern word processing tools on computers, it is possible to record your research notes directly into the same types of documents that you will use to write your paper. This can be an invaluable tool: for each source (book, magazine article, newspaper story, encyclopedia entry, or primary source), create a separate file, and copy useful quotations into the file, ''complete with pre-formatted citation''.  When it comes time to add the quotation to your paper, you can simply Copy/Paste the quotation into the document, along with its footnote.  Maintain a directory of sources on your computer means that you always have a resource to return to for future projects and papers.  

Careful selection of quotations in this manner will also create a summary of the article, book, or primary source in question.

== Bibliographies ==

All good history papers should have a list of sources cited.  This list is called a '''Bibliography''', though these days it is likely to include as many periodical articles and websites, as it is to contain books.  
 
Bibliographies follow different formats at different institutions; it would be difficult to categorize them all.  However, the general standard is to list ''primary sources'' first, in alphabetical order by author's name.  

''Secondary printed sources'', such as periodical literature, is listed the same way, after all the primary sources are accounted for.  

''Tertiary sources'', such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, thesauruses, and textbooks, would be listed next in high school-level research papers.  However, tertiary sources in general should usually be avoided for research papers written in college or graduate school (although magisterial works such as the Oxford English Dictionary might be cited in order to nail down the intended meaning of an unusual word in an older primary source.)

''Websites'' should be listed last. It is ironic on Wikibooks that we must caution against the prominent bibliographic placement of websites, but your grades are at stake here.   While there are reliable websites available on the Internet, it is very difficult to determine their general usefulness or staying power as historical sources; the website author may suffer bandwidth crunch, and take down the site.  The transcript of a purported &quot;pioneer's diary&quot; from 1853 on his site may be nothing more than a fiction.  If you have questions about the suitability of a website, check with your instructor, and be prepared .

=== Annotated Bibliographies ===

One useful tool for developing a bibliography for a specific paper is to keep a running word processing file in your computer's hard drive of all the books you have read or in which you have searched, along with a sentence-or-two description of the content.  In this way, you develop a lengthy list of materials that you have consulted as a scholar and as a reader, and you also have a handy reference guide for future papers.  Some students keep separate bibliographies in separate subjects; you might have an American history bibliography file, a German history file, an Asian history file, and so on.  Keeping a separate directory of these files allows you to develop a comprehensive background for future research.

=== Bibliographical Format ===

There are numerous standards for formatting your bibliography.  Every institution often has its own standards, and many professors choose one standard over another.  The MLA has one standard; a woman named Kate Turabian came up with another standard.  Both are available in book form at libraries and bookstores.  

Here are some simple standards to get you started.  In each case, you provide the name of the creator of the work, followed by the name of the resource set apart by underlines or quotations of some sorts.  Then you indicate when the work was produced, and where, and by whom.

* For a book:
: Last name, first name.  &lt;u&gt;'''Title'''.&lt;/u&gt; Place published: Publisher, year. 
:: Broad, William J. &lt;u&gt;'''The Oracle'''&lt;/u&gt; New York: Penguin Press, 2006.

* For a newspaper:
: Last name, first name. &quot;Article Title&quot; in &lt;U&gt;Newspaper name&lt;/u&gt;, published in  Day Month Year, on page #.

* For a magazine:
: Last name, first name. &quot;Article Title&quot; in &lt;u&gt;Magazine name&lt;/u&gt;, Vol. #, Week of Day Month Year. Place Published.

* For a Website:
: Last name of creator, first name.  URL: &lt;u&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.websitename.com/directory/subdir/page.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Date of last revision: day month year.  Date of Inquiry: day month year.

=== Due Dates for Bibliographies ===

Get your bibliography done early.  Begin adding items in the proper format to a computer file within 24 hours of being assigned the paper.  Expect to have at least one source in your bibliography for each page in length that the final paper is expected to be, if you are still in high school.  If you are in college or graduate school, expect that you will need two to four sources in your bibliography for each page in the final paper's length.

Ideally, if your teacher does not set a deadline for completion of the bibliography, set your own deadline.  Pick a day that is no more than one-quarter of the way through the time you have to write the paper.  If you have four weeks to write the paper, you should have a more or less complete list of books in your bibliography by Friday of the first week.  If you only have a week, have your bibliography complete by noon the day after it is assigned.

== Deadlines ==

Your instructor has set a specific due date for the paper. It may be that she has even set a specific hour of the day.  It is unwise to assume you will be able to get an extension.  Teachers have vacations, too; they set deadlines for their convenience.  '''Plan to meet that deadline with time to spare.'''

There are several ways to make sure you are not stressed and worried that you can get across campus and turn in your paper on time.

=== Silver Rule ===

'''Do it more than once ahead of time.''' This is the ''silver rule'': do a rough draft bibliography, a middle draft bibliography, and a final draft; Organize your paper according to several outlines, to find the one that suits your research best; find more information than you need, in more sources than you think are necessary; write and revise your final paper several times; have more than one back-up copy.  

=== Procrastination ===

Avoid procrastination.  Saunter from class to the library, the day the paper's assigned.  Check out a book, and photocopy one article.  Note both down in your bibliography.  Create your quotations file and your paper file on your computer's word processor.  Get it set up with templates for quotations and footnotes and page numbers.  Get at least a few things typed into every file. 

Look! You've gotten started!  It's a lot harder to procrastinate once you realize the book you check out of the library only has ten relevant facts, and the article is not as useful as it looked at first glance.  

=== Major Personal Due Dates ===

'''Set some personal due dates''' even if your instructor does not.  Here are your critical due dates; note them down in your calendar or planning book, and put a sign up in your room:

* Complete bibliography by mm/dd/yy
* Four sources researched by mm/dd/yy
** Ten sources researched by mm/dd/yy ''(more of these are optional, but a good idea)''
* Outline drafted by mm/dd/yy
* Writing begun by mm/dd/yy
* Revised Outline by mm/dd/yy
* Revising begun by mm/dd/yy
* Consult with classmates/colleagues/instructors by mm/dd/yy
* Print final draft by mm/dd/yy and hh:mm ''(leave yourself an hour to get across campus, and deal with technical challenges)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
This is an entry-level introduction to writing web applications in the [http://www.php.net PHP] programming language.  It focuses in providing the reader with all of the information that they need to know to get started with web development, without covering &amp;ldquo;advanced&amp;rdquo; programming concepts.  This book is '''not''' a reference work: it is intended to teach web application development, as well as PHP, to the reader.

This book covers PHP 5, and makes use of the features of PHP 5 that are not present in previous major releases of PHP, such as PHP 3 or 4.  PHP 5 has been out for long enough that nearly every serious hosting provider should have made the upgrade to it by this point in time.  PHP 5 has features that simplify the development process for web applications, and it is recommended.

This book makes use of information in [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] as well as on the Internet.  As much neutral, objective information as possible is used to allow the reader to perform their own independent research and learning outside of the text of this book as necessary or desired.  The goal of this book is to be an extremely high-quality work and to stand on as much pre-published information as available.  Citations of, and references to other works should be considered to be normal, and encouraged.

=== To readers new to Wikibooks ===
There is no &amp;ldquo;Errata&amp;rdquo; document published for this book.  This book is an evolving work, and any errors are likely to be fixed when pointed out or otherwise found.  If there is a possible error to investigate, use the discussion link at the top of the page with questionable information so that it can be investigated.  If any information in this book contradicts official documentation or specifications, the reader may make the assumption that the official documentation is correct, unless there is documented, verifiable proof to the contrary.

== Structure of This Book ==
This book is structured to be read from &amp;ldquo;front&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;back&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; from top to bottom in the [[/Table of Contents|Table of Contents]].  This book attempts to build on previously presented topics, so as to allow for logical presentation of content.  There are also tasks for the reader to work on, presented throughout the text of the book, with probable solutions presented in appendices to the book.  The reader is encouraged to work on the examples, and then '''compare''' what they have come up with to what is presented by the book.

== Programming Examples ==
It should go without saying that programming examples included with this book are released under the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GNU Free Documentation License].  Each example is intended to stand independently to demonstrate the immediate concept at hand, and examples should be heavily commented (more than &amp;ldquo;usual&amp;rdquo; code) to illustrate the how and why things are done.

Examples should also be tested, and cleanly work when copied and pasted for use.  No warnings should be emitted, and examples should be kept up-to-date with current best practices and stadards, when possible.  Any depreciated code should be clearly marked as such, when demonstrating historical methods.

== Prior Experience ==
The reader is assumed to have no prior experience with writing programs in any language.  This is an entry-level work, and so it is intended to be more verbose with regard to the basics than an intermediate or advanced level text on web application programming.

== Covered Topics ==
This book covers all of the topics that are necessary for entry-level web application programming.  There is information on the following subjects within this book:

* [[Wikipedia:HTML|HTML]]
* [[Wikipedia:XHTML|XHTML]] (At this time, cursory; this book uses HTML 4.01 throughout, due to issues with XHTML proper and Microsoft Internet Explorer.)
* [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]
* [[JavaScript]]
* [[Wikipedia:PHP|PHP]] 5 ([http://www.php.net/manual/en PHP Manual])
* And more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Somewhere between creating an outline and turning in your paper, you actually have to sit down and '''write the paper''': you must turn your outline into complete sentences arranged in paragraphs.

== Writing ==

Writing remains the greatest challenge in publishing a research paper.  All the reading and note-taking in the world will not translate a mountain of data into ten or twenty or a hundred well-written pages that earn an A and see that you get your diploma on-time.  There are some tricks that will get you through the rough days of writing, and produce a finished paper on time.

=== Determining your Pace ===

Many students writing a research paper for the first time greatly underestimate the amount of time necessary to complete one.  A research paper of three to six pages may be assigned only a week in advance of its due date, but this is a signal that you should begin researching immediately.  If you have a three week window in which to write, you should begin writing (with 80% or more of your research complete) by Wednesday of the second week.  Of course, your own writing skills may argue for an earlier or later &quot;begin writing&quot; date than that.

=== Rewriting ===

Be sure to allow yourself time for editing and re-writing.  Few people can turn out a letter-perfect research paper on their first try.  Attend help sessions at your school's writing center, and ask friends to look over a completed first draft.  Getting back comments, and trying to fix flaws, in an uncompleted paper may put you at risk for missing your due date or deadline.  '''Always finish a rough draft first''', so that you have something to hand in even in the event of a catastrophic loss of your paper.

=== Backing Up ===

Remember to back up your work regularly.  The excuse &quot;I'm sorry, but my computer hard drive failed this morning,&quot; will earn some sympathy, but is still a failing grade.  Back up your research, back up your writing, back up your bibliography.  Save both print and digital copies of the most critical pieces of your work, such as data tables, bibliographies, and chapters that you wrote in an inspired frenzy after an all-night conversation with your classmates.  These things have a tendency to vanish unexpectedly.

Part of backing up is maintaining a clean and friendly workspace, so that dangerous accidents are less likely.  When you are working on a research paper, put all food and drink away.  You risk damage to your computer, your research materials and your final paper when you have liquids and messy solids near your work.  Take pride in your labors, and avoid eating and writing at the same time.  If you're hungry, take a ten-minute break, have a snack and something to drink; then put away your food, and go back to working.

== Types of Paragraphs == 

Paragraphs in a history paper come in several types.  The three most general types are Thesis, or opening paragraphs, Body paragraphs, and Conclusion paragraphs.  The following is not a comprehensive list (yet) of the different types of paragraphs historians use, but each example contains a basic description of what the paragraph's purpose is, and a sample topic sentence for each type of paragraph. 

The two most critical types of paragraphs are Thesis paragraphs and Concluding paragraphs.

=== Thesis Paragraphs ===

A '''Thesis''' is a statement which encapsulates the point of view which you are presenting to your reader.  A ''thesis paragraph'', therefore, is a statement of your point of view, plus the general outline in a few sentences of the research in your paper.  &quot;Napoleon's Hundred Days pushed the great powers of Europe to adopt fierce controls on their citizens which persisted until World War I.&quot;  The following sentences might mention broadened police powers, the reconstruction of numerous European cities to allow fields of fire for artillery and infantry, increased state prerogatives to interfere in private affairs, and tightening of the legal structures of several European nations.  (However, many would argue that this is a very broad thesis, and the amount of proof necessary to convince others would be substantial.)

==== Narrow and Broad Proofs ====

The wider and more elaborate and far-reaching your thesis statement is, the more details -- the more proof -- you will need to back it up.  Most research papers concentrate on only a few years or decades at most.  Ideally, a thesis should be ''narrow'': you should not attempt to prove 
that a curse lay upon the Tomb of Tutanhkamun simply because Lord Caernarveron died.  

=== Concluding Paragraphs ===

'''Concluding paragraphs''' represent a re-iteration of what you said in your thesis paragraph.  You should not introduce new ideas, new data, or new materials in your final sentences. Instead, find a way to summarize your major themes, and re-state the thesis from your first paragraph.  In essence, you are reminding your reader of what you set out to prove at the start, and (hopefully) show that you have proved it.

=== Body Paragraphs ===

'''Body paragraphs''' constitute the main core of your argument.  

==== Descriptive Paragraphs ====

'''Descriptive paragraphs''' are designed to inform the reader's imagination, and give them a picture in their mind of what you, the author, see or feel about the subject. &quot;As part of his routine to control the Russian royal family, Rasputin affected a fearsome appearance with wild hair and mesmerizing eyes.&quot;  Each sentence of this paragraph should build up a picture in our eyes of what Rasputin wore and how he behaved.

==== Summary Paragraphs ====

'''Summary paragraphs'' are designed to report a series of events in an orderly but concise way. &quot;As Lincoln's funeral train progressed from Washington, DC to Springfield IL, ordinary Americans made numerous displays of affection for the fallen president.&quot;  Each sentence in this paragraph will tell a different story from some of the stops that the train made.

==== Contrast Paragraphs ====

'''Contrast paragraphs''' are designed to emphasize differences between two things or events. &quot;Although they were related, president Franklin Roosevelt conducted his administration quite differently than Theodore Roosevelt.&quot;  Each pair of sentences in this paragraph should find ways to show that the two men behaved differently.

==== Comparison Paragraphs ====

'''Comparison paragraphs''' are designed to emphasize similarities between two distinct things or events.  &quot;The Suez Canal project and the Panama Canal project faced similar difficulties.&quot;  Each sentence in this paragraph should find a point of similarity between the two engineering projects.

==== Narrative Paragraphs ====

'''Narrative paragraphs''' are designed to tell in a few sentences what a person or group might be doing.  &quot;At Yalta, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin worked long days to draft proposals for a working peace at the war's end.&quot;  Each sentence in this paragraph should involve at least two of the men named in the topic sentence, and what they did at Yalta.

==== Supposition Paragraphs ====

Historians love to play ''What If'' games of various sorts, and '''Supposition''' paragraphs are designed to tell in a few sentences what might have happened. &quot;Had the emperor not recalled his fleets and established barriers to overseas travel, China might have come to dominate the southwestern Pacific.&quot;  The sentences following this topic sentence would deal with fictional but probable outcomes of Chinese fleets in Indonesia, Australia, and India.  ''The use of this type of paragraph should be limited, with a rule of thumb of one such paragraph per ten pages.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==California Revision needed==
&quot;California remained largely unpopulated until 1848, when gold was found at the mill of John Sutter, who lived in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, 40 miles east of Sacramento. Word spread of the gold on the American River (the river on which Sutter's mill was located on), and hordes of people rushed into California to mine gold. The rush peaked in 1849, and those who came during that year were known as &quot;forty-niners.&quot; The population of the northern California city of San Francisco exploded as a result of the immigration to the region.&quot;

Please conduct futher research on this section, since it implies that whites where the first to colonized california.  This is incorrect, evidence is provided by the number of old cities with spanish names such as Monterey, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.  In addition the early spanish, were preceded by earlier native communities.

== John Tyler Presidency ==

I'm not the one to do it, but the last edit needs to be corrected.

Tyler had once been a beetles supporter but now he saddly wanted to be a Democrat, but he disliked Jackson, and he became a Whig. He was a weak supporter of states' rights, so when many of the Whig bills came to him, they were never vetoed. It turned out that Tyler would veto the entire Whig congressional agenda. The Whigs saw this as the party leader turning on his own party

Much of this doesn't even make sense.

== Texas and Mexico ==

This section has some horrible writing. I would try to edit it but I'm not sure what it's trying to say. And what's up with the use of &quot;white Americans&quot;? [[User:Beamathan|Beamathan]] ([[User talk:Beamathan|talk]]) 00:33, 2 June 2008 (UTC)

== freedom's ferment shtick ==

What about abolition's fellow travelers: women's movements, labor movements, socialist experiments, religious experiments, yadda yadda?  Would help to loosen up the chronology a bit, because a lot of these movements have their roots in the Jacksonian era and flourish in the 1840s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As a user, you control application software &amp;mdash; or programs &amp;mdash; that are already written for you to use.  Examples of this include your web browser, word processor, or Internet e-mail program.  If you need something more than what has been provided for you, however, you are out of luck, unless you know how to give the computer instructions on your own.  This is where the practice of [[Wikipedia:Computer programming|programming]] comes into play.

As you read through this section, you will learn about what programming is, and why you might want to write '''Web applications'''.  Keep in mind that term '''Web application''' throughout this book means &amp;ldquo;an application accessed through a web browser&amp;rdquo;.  This could be on an [[Wikipedia:Intranet|intranet]] or on the [[Wikipedia:Internet|Internet]].

== Programming, in General ==

Computer programming is simply writing a set of instructions for the computer to use to perform a certain task.  In essence, you give the computer small steps of instructions, and the computer goes down the list, executing each one in order{{ref|out_of_order_execution}}.  By programming, you can &amp;ldquo;teach&amp;rdquo; the computer how to perform new tasks, or perform old tasks in new ways.
As a user, you control application software &amp;mdash; or programs &amp;mdash; that are already written for you to use. Examples of this include your web browser, word processor, or Internet e-mail program. If you need something more than what has been provided for you, however, you are out of luck, unless you know how to give the computer instructions on your own. This is where the practice of [[Wikipedia:Computer programming|programming]] comes into play.
Computers, however, do not &amp;ldquo;speak&amp;rdquo; English.  This means that you will have to learn how to communicate with the computer to make your instructions work.  Unlike human languages, there is a best language for each purpose, so it is entirely possible that over time you will learn new languages for doing different types of tasks.  This book focuses on the basics of web application programming with one of the most popular web development languages, [http://www.php.org/ PHP].

== What is Web Programming? ==

Web Programming is the practice of writing applications that run on a [[Wikipedia:Web server|web server]], which can, in turn, be accessed by many different users.  There are many applications which are suitable to be run over the web, and because of that, web applications have become extremely popular.  A few examples of popular web applications are [https://gmail.google.com/ Gmail] and [http://maps.google.com Google Maps].  These are applications in which users are able to send and receive Internet e-mail, and get maps, satellite images, and directions, respectively.

Web application programming has several advantages over methodologies such as [[Wikipedia:client-server programming|client-server programming]] for applications such as e-mail and [[Wikipedia:geocoding|geocoding]].  Web applications can be made in such a way as to be '''portable''' &amp;mdash; that is, able to run on many types of clients.  Some care must be taken to achieve this, however, we will go into that later in the text.  Web applications do not generally have to be compiled to be tested, and web applications can run from anywhere in relation to the user.  Additionally, web applications allow users that have low-powered hardware to be able to perform computationally intensive tasks without using their own computer.  For example, Google does the geocoding and the mapping for users, and then simply transmits the data back to the user.  The user&amp;rsquo;s computer does not have to actually perform the computations necessary to get the data for the user.

There are some disadvantages to writing web applications that must be considered.  Applications that are extremely computationally intensive, for example, may perform sluggishly with poor planning.  Highly popular applications may require load balancing and such to handle a heavy user-base.  Network resources can become heavily loaded if the user-base grows or is using the web application more than anticipated.  Generally, all of these things can be taken care of by careful planning, however.

== What is PHP? ==

PHP is an [[Wikipedia:Open source software|Open Source]] scripting language that is available to the public for free (both gratis and libre).  It is primarily used for programs written to run on servers, over the web.  More information on PHP is available on Wikipedia in the [[Wikipedia:PHP|PHP article]] and the [http://www.php.net PHP web site], and, of course, throughout this book.

== What Types of Applications are Good Web Applications? ==

In general, any application that:

* Has a moderate to high number of users
* Has consolidated, shared data storage (such as a database)
* Has business rules that are not always easily enforced on the client side
* Does not have high computation overhead for every user

... is a good candidate for becoming a web application.  Sometimes, there are exceptions from these rules, depending on the business.  Many applications that are client-server applications fall into the category of being an able candidate for being re-written as a web application.

== What Types of Applications are Not Good Web Applications? ==

Applications that have extremely high computing overhead for a user (i.e., video conversion/recoding) generally are not good candidates for becoming web applications.  Tasks that '''must''' be done on the client computer (such as burning a CD) are also not good candidates for web applications.  There are applications that make advanced use of clustering technologies (where multiple servers are working together) and load-balancing (where servers are working individually, but getting only a certain percentage of the load), however, those are outside the scope of this document.

== Why Write a Web Application? ==

There are multiple reasons to write web applications as opposed to a traditional application.  There are also more varied types of applications that are unique to the web, which would be impractical as a client-server application.  For example, a web site for a support organization should not be a static web site.  It should actually be a web application that works with databases (perhaps even more than one) and other sources of input.  It may even have a content management system that has Frequently Asked Questions for users, or How-To information, or general background/historical information.

Web applications are generally faster to develop then applications that are written in systems programming languages, such as C or C++.  There are also many different environments that help you to write, test, and debug in a very fast, streamlined cycle.  We will get into some of these later in this book.

Another advantage to web applications is that they also have an unusually clear line between what is called the '''front-end''' and the '''back-end'''.  The user always sees the results that are displayed by the front end, while the back end is never visible.  Programs written with different development models (such as client-server applications) have various degrees of separation of the front-end and back-end, and because of the nature of such applications, there is no clear line between them{{ref|client_server_front_back_end}}.

One advantage – and disadvantage – to traditional web applications is that the source code is always hidden from the user.  Because the code is not running on the user&amp;rsquo;s PC in any capacity, the user is not able to view the actual code.  This is something of a double-edged sword:  It means that you can conceal the code, and the back-end processes, completely from the user.  This makes it harder to reverse-engineer, which is good for proprietary code.  However, it can be harder to manage from the standpoint of a technical user, since the source code for the web application and the processes are completely hidden from anybody that does not have access to the code on the server.  This is a decision that is made before the work starts on a project, traditionally.  Most people view this as an advantage.

# {{note|client_server_front_back_end}}Client-server applications can have the computing tasks shared between the client and server, or all the processing can be done on the server, or there can be varying degrees of this separation.  It is actually up to the programmer&amp;rsquo;s discretion.  This is partially true in Web applications, as well, as we will see later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Brushes for Varnishing =

Which kind of brush to use is a matter of personal opinion and depends upon the job. For a lot of jobs, cheap foam brushes will suffice. Foam brushes should not be used for long before being replaced. The brush you use is unlikely to make that much difference to the job unless you are an experienced varnisher. The preparation work, mix of varnish and temperature probably have more of an effect on the end result than the brush. The idea of a dedicated varnish brush is that you should be able to make long uninterrupted strokes without having to refresh the brush.

If you use a brush with bristles, it is worth investing in a good quality one, if only for the reason that when cheap brushes lose their bristles they make a mess of the work. Loose bristles can be dislodged ahead of time by gently rubbing and rolling the brush against some sandpaper. Some say that a dab of varnish in the heel of the brush can help to keep the bristles in.

Foam brushes are not as well suited for larger surfaces and jobs, where it is important not to have any runs. Good china bristle brushes are better in these circumstances. Foam brushes are fine for patching in and quick jobs on small work pieces. Rebecca Wittman, the author of 'Brightwork' uses &quot;Jen&quot; poly-foam brushes (they do not turn to mush when used with epoxy). It is possible to buy really expensive bristle brushes, but it is not necessary to go beyond Hamilton, Epiphanes or Omega to get the best job that you are capable of. The best varnish brush is one that will hold a full load of material, without drooling and dripping from the can to the work surface and will feather the flow out evenly. Foam brushes don't offer the control needed because the varinish lays on the surface of the brush and not within the fibers that a bristle brush has. China boar bristles are best because the ends are split into flags.

Good brushes don't swell and they regain their shape quickly. Good brushes can last for a very long time, decades in fact. Don't let them soak and comb them out frequently, to stop a skin from setting around the high tide mark. A needle sharp paint comb, the sharpest one you can buy, is very good if you are a brush user, Don't forget how sharp the combs are.

== How to keep a brush pristine for over 40 years ==

The following was posted by Jay Greer on the WoodenBoat Forum:

My own Linzer China Boar Varnish Brushes with soldered ferrells are no longer made. I have cherished and kept them pristine for use for over forty years, as follows.

All of my brushes are stored under thinner in two one gallon, wide mouth commercial salad dressing plastic jars, one for paint and one for varnish brushes. After use, the brushes are given no less than five rinses in thinner stored in three 5gallon paint buckets. The last two rinses are with fresh thinner. The brushes are then wrapped in the porous black paper used for scrap books and photo albums and placed tips down in the storage container. This manner of storage keeps the chisle edge of the brushes intact.

Once a year or when the heels get too filled with excess varnish or paint, I soak the bristles in liquid sandpaper to soften the heels and brush out the residue with a fine wire brush. This takes several soakings and several brushings. Then, while standing at a beam of light comming through a crack in the shop door, I flip the hairs of the brush until no flakes of varnish can be seen floating in the sun beam.

Sadly, brushes made today are no longer of the fine quality of the old Linzers. I treat them like they were my best friends because they still earn their keep!

== Depth of Book? ==

I'm wondering if this book is going to be simply a reference to programming using regular expressions, or if this book will cover the mathematical theory behind regular expressions. Explaining the theory behind it would require a divergance into autmata theory, state machines, etc. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:02, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

:I think that is perfectly valid content for this book.  It should probably be in a chapter devoted to advanced topics. &amp;mdash; &lt;b&gt;[[User:franl|franl]]&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;&amp;#x2726;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Franl|talk]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;small&gt;&amp;#x2726;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;17:11, 5 06 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

== How can we differentiate this content from the Wikipedia article? ==

The corresponding Wikipedia article &amp;ndash; [[Wikipedia:Regular Expressions]] &amp;ndash; is very detailed.  How can we differentiate this book's content from that article?  Perhaps this book should have a tutorial style? &amp;mdash; &lt;b&gt;[[User:franl|franl]]&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;&amp;#x2726;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps&quot;&gt;[[User_talk:Franl|talk]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;small&gt;&amp;#x2726;&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;17:22, 5 06 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

:I don't know if you have any available, but there are a number of existing book references on the subject of regular expressions. You could use these existing books to prepare a book-length outline or plan for implementing this wikibook. Also, there are a number of different computer languages that utilize regular expressions (Perl, sed/awk, emacs, PHP, etc), and you could easily devote a page to regular expression implementation in each different language. Also, you could include projects using regular expressions, such as a C preprocessor module, HTML tag extractor, loader (with virtual address correction), automatic spell checker, etc.  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:51, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

::Note, I am glad to help here, will be my first contributions to this project![[User:Eagle 101|Eagle 101]] 03:24, 7 June 2006 (UTC)
:::Though I have worked on wikipedia for 5 months, I know nothing of what to do here...[[User:Eagle 101|Eagle 101]] 03:27, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

== Automata theory ==

As per my note above, I have decided to create a new wikibook on the subject of automata theory. Currently, this new book is in the planning stage, and exists only as a preliminary outline [[User:Whiteknight/Automata Theory|HERE on my user page]]. Since this is only an outline, I would appreciate any comments or suggestions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:19, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

== Beginner Mistakes? ==

I'd like to suggest that there be a section on trouble-shooting regex patterns. I've learned about regex in the past week and have written up two problems I had on my blog here:
http://www.mind-manual.com/blog/index.php/2008/08/07/regular-expressions-how-i-hatelove-thee/. I'd do it myself but I'm not sure whether it'll fit into the context of this book. Cheers!

== Renaming chapters and more ==

I have made edits across the book, summarized here.

In May 2011‎, chapter [[Regular Expressions/Syntaxes]] was split into subchapters:
* Regular Expressions/syntax/shell regular expression
* Regular Expressions/syntax/simple regular expression
* Regular Expressions/syntax/basic regular expression
* Regular Expressions/syntax/emacs regular expression
* Regular Expressions/syntax/non posix basic regular expression
* Regular Expressions/syntax/perl compatible regular expression
* Regular Expressions/syntax/posix basic regular expression
* Regular Expressions/syntax/posix extended regular expression
Today, I have renamed the subchapters to make them shallowly named and capitalized:
* Regular Expressions/Shell Regular Expressions
* Regular Expressions/Simple Regular Expressions
* Regular Expressions/Basic Regular Expressions
* Regular Expressions/Emacs Regular Expressions
* Regular Expressions/Non-Posix Basic Regular Expressions
* Regular Expressions/Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
* Regular Expressions/Posix Basic Regular Expressions
* Regular Expressions/Posix Extended Regular Expressions
I have made further edits:
* Rename heading &quot;Tools using this regular expression syntax&quot; to &quot;Use in Tools&quot;.
* Remove the first heading from each chapter that only repeats the chapter name.
* Remove unneeded redlinks to some keywords, as in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Regular_Expressions/Simple_Regular_Expressions&amp;diff=2536104&amp;oldid=2536083 this edit].
* Add section &quot;Links&quot; to some chapters to stand for external links.
--[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 09:32, 15 June 2013 (UTC)

== Redundant pages ==

I request that the following pages added in May 2011‎, redundant to what the book already has, get deleted:
* [[Regular Expressions/operator]]
* [[Regular Expressions/operator/asterisk]]
* [[Regular Expressions/operator/backslash]]
* [[Regular Expressions/operator/box]]
* [[Regular Expressions/operator/careted box]]
* [[Regular Expressions/operator/character range]]
* [[Regular Expressions/operator/dot]]
* [[Regular Expressions/operator/parentheses]]
I especially object to having a subpage per operator.

== Development Environments ==

There are various development environments that are available for web development, with various ranges of quality.  Whichever system you choose is going to depend on at least a couple of different factors:

* The operating system you are using.
* Whether or not you want an open source or proprietary '''IDE'''{{ref|ide_definition}}, or just a programmer&amp;rsquo;s editor.
* Your style and preferences.
* What type of workstation you have (with regard to RAM and processor).

There are many different pieces of software available for working with web applications in languages such as PHP.  Some environments have support for multiple languages, and others do not.  There are a number of available choices, both for programmer&amp;rsquo;s editors and IDEs.

=== Windows Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Editors/IDEs ===

# [http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm Notepad++]—Editor – Features syntax highlighting for many different languages, record/playback macros, text snippets.  Freely available.

This document shows using GNU Emacs, and the author recommends the use of GNU Emacs.  There is a [http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/gnu3/ book from O’Reilly] on GNU Emacs, though it is a slight bit out of date.  If you choose to use GNU Emacs, you may wish to take a look at [http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/ nXML mode], which the author also uses for development of PHP applications.

== What You Will Need ==

For the purposes of this text, all you really will likely '''need''' is a basic text editor.  You can use Notepad on Windows, or &lt;code&gt;vi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;emacs&lt;/code&gt;, or whatever your favorite text editor is on your non-Windows system.  Syntax highlighting may be beneficial if you are a visual type of person.

No matter what text editor or IDE you use, you will at the very least need to know how to create, load, and save files, as well as actually use the editor.  However, you will want to be sure to only use text editors – not a word processor or &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; text editor.

== Execution Environment: Apache, PHP 5, and a Database Server ==

After you have selected your editor, you will need to make sure that you have an environment to run PHP applications in.  It is likely that you can find some place online that hosts PHP web sites and applications that you can work with.  If you are unable to do that, then you will need to install PHP on your system, probably with a database system.

Users of Linux-based distributions should be able to simply add Apache, PHP 5, and a database server to your system using your package management tools.  Under Windows, there are a couple of options for easy setup and configuration of a WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP) system:

* [http://www.en.wampserver.com/index.php WAMPServer]
* [http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html XAMPP]
* [http://www.easyphp.org EasyPHP]

After you have set up your environment, you are ready to continue onward!

== Footnotes ==

# {{note|ide_definition}}'''IDE'''—Integrated Development Environment.  A piece of software which has features which help you develop software.  Generally, IDEs have more features then just a programmer&amp;rsquo;s editor.  IDEs can help you to debug your code, as well as use version control systems or automatically upload your project to the target web site.
# {{note|emacs_editor}}GNU Emacs is a cross-platform &amp;ldquo;Swiss army knife&amp;rdquo; editor.  It has the potential to support everything in the book, even tasks other than editing, such as e-mail and Web browsing.  There are several available books dedicated just to GNU Emacs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Capacitor==
Capacitor is a device that can be used to Charge, Discharge, or Store Electric Energy in form of an Electric Field.

===Capacitor's Construction=== 
A device is made from two conductive &quot;plates&quot; separated by a thin layer of insulation called Dielectric
([[w:Dielectic|dielectric]]).

===Capacitor's Symbol===
[[File:Capacitor.gif|200px]]

===Capacitance===
Capacitance is defined as the capability of storing charge of a given voltage on each plate which is directly proportional to Dielectric constant, the area of the plate and inversely proportional to the separation distance between two plates. 
:&lt;math&gt;C=\frac{Q}{V}&lt;/math&gt; = ε &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

Capacitance has a symbol C measured in unit Farad which has symbol F.

==Capacitor and Electricity==
[[image:Capacitor Charge-Discarge.svg|right|300px|thumb|A diagram to show how the size of a capacitor affects its charging/discharging. A relative charge of 1 means that the capacitor is fully charged. 0 means it is fully discharged. The time constant, &lt;i&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;/i&gt;, is a measure of the rate of charging or discharging.]]

When a voltage is applied across the plates of a capacitor, charges of opposite sign will be developed across each plate until voltage across each plate equals to voltage applied, then each plate will have a charge Q and a voltage V . This process is called Charging Capacitor
:;Q = q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... = &lt;math&gt;\int I dt&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of Charge over Voltage gives the Capacitance of the capacitor
:;&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{Q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point, when each plate has the same voltage as the applied voltage, there is no current flow in the circuit. Each plate of the capacitor has a voltage V. 
Capacitor Stores Electric Energy. 

If one disconnect the capacitor from the voltage source, the capacitor still has voltage V and will cause shock if touching it. Hence care must be used when disconnecting a capacitor.

If a charged capacitor is connected to ground, current starts to flow from capacitor to the ground until voltage on the capacitor equals to zero. This process is called Discharging Capacitor.

==Characteristics==
===Charge===
:Q = q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ...
:;&lt;math&gt;Q = \int I dt&lt;/math&gt;

===Capacitance===
:;&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{Q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

===Voltage===
:;&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{1}{C} \int I dt&lt;/math&gt;

===Current===
:;&lt;math&gt;I = C \frac{dV}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

===Reactance===
Reactance is defined as the ratio of Voltage over current
:&lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac{\frac{1}{C} \int I dt}{I}&lt;/math&gt;
:;&lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;/_-90
:;&lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac{1}{j \omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
:;&lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac{1}{s C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Impedance===
Since all conductor has Resistance the real capacitor's impedance is defined as the sum of Reactance and Resistance of Capacitor . 
:;&lt;math&gt;Z_C = R_C + X_C&lt;/math&gt;
:;&lt;math&gt;Z_C = \sqrt{R_C^2 + (\frac{1}{s C})^2 }&lt;/math&gt;/_ Tan&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega RC}&lt;/math&gt;
:;&lt;math&gt;Z_C= R_C+  \frac{1}{j \omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
:;&lt;math&gt;Z_C = R_C +  \frac{1}{s C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Frequency Respond===
Capacitor is a tool depends on frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega &lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0  , X_C = 00&lt;/math&gt;, Capacitor Opened circuit, I = 0
* &lt;math&gt;\omega = 00  , X_C = 0&lt;/math&gt;, Capacitor Closed circuit, I ≠ 0
* &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{CR_C}&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;X_C = R_C&lt;/math&gt; , 
: &lt;math&gt;Z_C = \sqrt{2}R_C&lt;/math&gt; , 
: &lt;math&gt;V_C = \frac {V}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;I_C = \frac {V}{2R_C}&lt;/math&gt;

With the value of I at three frequency points ω = 0, 00 , 1 / CR&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; I - f curve can be drawn to give a picture of current in the capacitor over time

===Phase Angle===
When a Voltage is applied across Capacitor , it will take some time before capacitor conducts Current . Therefore, Curent on the Capacitor will lags behind Voltage an angle θ

For Ideal losses capacitor which has no internal resistance, Current will lage behind Voltage an angle 90 . For Non - Ideal lossless capacitor which has an internal resistance, Current will lage behind Voltage an angle θ
:; &lt;math&gt;Tan\theta = \frac{1}{2\pi f} \frac{1}{CR}&lt;/math&gt;

Phase angle relates to time frequecy or time and the value of C and R&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; . When there is a change in phase angle Time and frequency also change . For this reason RC network is used in Phase Shifting
:;&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{Tan\theta} \frac{1}{CR}&lt;/math&gt;  
:;t = 2π Tanθ CR&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;

==Capacitor Network==
===Series Connection===
[[Image:capacitors in series.svg|right|thumb|Several capacitors in series.]]
When n capacitor connected in series, the total capacitance
:;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{C_t} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + ... + \frac{1}{C_n}&lt;/math&gt;


When there are two capacitor of the same capacitance connected in series, the total  capacitance of the two capacitors is exactly halved


===Parallel Connection===
[[Image:capacitors in parallel.svg|right|thumb|Several capacitors in parallel.]]
When n capacitor connected in parallel, the total capacitance
:;&lt;math&gt;C_t = C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n&lt;/math&gt;


When there are two capacitor of the same capacitance connected in parallel, the total  capacitance of the two capacitors is exactly doubled

==Voltage==

Capacitors can only take a certain voltage across the plates before the dielectric breaks down, and current flows through the capacitor. When this happens, the capacitor is destroyed. This can involve explosion in some types of capacitors.

The common voltage limits for capacitors are:

*10V
*16V
*25V
*35V
*63V
*100V
*200V
*450V

This list is not exhaustive, and there are many capacitors with a voltage rating in between these values.

==Temperature==
Some capacitors contain liquid that must not be allowed to boil or freeze. These therefore have specific operating and storage temperature ranges which must not be exceeded if the capacitor is to kept intact. This is most important for electrolytic capacitors.

The common top temperature ranges for capacitors are:

*85°C
*105°C

==Types of Capacitors==

There are many different types of capacitors that can be used. We are most interested in electrolytic and ceramic capacitors, as they are the commonly available ones that are suitable for our level of working. For more types, see [[w:Capacitor (component)#Types of dielectric|this Wikipedia article]].

===Ceramic Disc===

[[Image:Ceramic Disc Capacitor.jpg|200|thumb|right|A ceramic disc capacitor.]]
Ceramic capacitors generally take the form of a disc of ceramic with two legs protruding downwards. These capacitors are not polarised - it doesn't matter which way round they are put into a circuit. The capacitances vary from a lower limit of less than 1pF, up to about 100nF. They sometimes exhibit '''drifting''' which is where capacitance changes, due to ambient conditions. This is not usually a problem, but it is something you should be aware of.

===Electrolytic===

[[Image:Capacitors_electrolytic.jpg|200|thumb|right|Axial (top) and radial (bottom) electrolytic capacitors.]]

Electrolytic capacitors have very large capacitance per volume unit, which makes them good for capacitances over 1&amp;mu;F. They take the form of cylinders which range form a few millimetres in height to several hundred. There are two main types of packaging: axial and radial. Axial capacitors are generally rarer than radial capacitors and have a lead on each end of the cylinder. Radial capacitors have both leads on the same end.

These capacitors are polarised and '''must''' be connected the right way around. The negative terminal, or cathode, is usually marked in any of the following ways:

*A stripe down the cathode side of the capacitor, usually with minus signs printed on it
*A shorter lead at the anode than at the cathode (not found on axial capacitors)
*A minus sign printed on the end of the capacitor, next to the negative lead.

Electrolytic capacitors can explode violently if they are connected incorrectly, overheat, or have too much voltage across them. Larger capacitors have vents scored into the metal ends, but they will still make a very loud noise (which can damage hearing) and spray hot electrolyte from the rupture.

They generally have poor tolerances, and are used mostly where precise capacitance is unimportant, such as for power supply smoothing, stiffening, etc.

==Capacitor Labels==
The markings on a capacitor usually identify the properties and safe usage parameters. The value of its capacitance is measured in Farads, or metric divisions such as micro, nano, or pico Farads. The markings are often encoded depending on the type of capacitor and vary by capacitor type based on room available for designation and intended use. 

Electrolytic are written in decimal numbers and wester characters, for example 10uF means 10 microFarad, or 10x10^-6 Farad.

Ceramic disk capacitors and certain others are marked in a number code based on the number of pico Farad or 1x10^-12 Farad. To decode, take the first two numbers of the 3 digit number code as the first two digits, then add a number of zero placeholders after it matching the third digit. This is now the capacitance in pF. So a 104 would be 100000pF, or 100nF. Some capacitors are marked similarly, but instead are coded in nano farad. Manufacturers specifications would be necessary to distinguish. This type of capacitor varies its size by its capacitance and can be compared in value by size, provided the two in comparison are made of the same material.

Mica capacitors are not in common use in 2006, but are extremely stable and marked with a six spot color code. First find the arrow and view the package with it pointing right and read from top left, clockwise the six colors similar to resistor color code. First is the capacitor type, second and third are the significant digits, fourth (bottom right) is the multiplier (number of trailing zeros), fifth is the tolerance, and sixth (bottom left) is the class or characteristic code.

==Safety==

Capacitors can explode if overloaded or connected incorrectly. This can result in loud bang, which can damage hearing, and a spray of hot (or vapourised) electrolyte which can burn skin and damage eyesight.

Large capacitors, especially high voltage ones such as the ones in televisions can store a lethal charge on them. Always ensure that the capacitors are fully discharged before going near them.

== The Tradition of &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; ==

&amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; is often the first program any student of a new language learns.  It just so happens that since we are covering multiple languages and approaches in this book, you are going to see different versions of &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; for each way of tackling the problem.  Not all examples in this book will be presented form all the different methods possible.  However, it is important to realize that any time you are working with development on a web application, there are always different ways to solve a single problem.

== &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; in plain HTML 4.01 ==

The first way that &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; can be written is as a static HTML 4.01 page.  HTML itself will form the basis for nearly every single web application you will ever write, and so it is imperative to not underestimate the importance of correct HTML.
[[image:elpwad_hello_html.png|frame|center|Hello, World in HTML]]
This will simply display &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; in your browser window, with &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; as the page title.

=== What is the DOCTYPE? ===

The first line in the HTML document above is the DOCTYPE&amp;mdash;the Document Type.  The Document Type is what tells the web browser how to interpret the document that follows it.  There are several document types that are valid for web applications written today.  It is important that you choose the correct one for your application, and then stick with it.

The document type above tells the browser to use HTML 4.01 Strict&amp;mdash;which is the document type that we will use throughout this entire book.  There are other document types available for use:

 &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;

This is HTML 4.01 Strict.  If you have used HTML in the past, such as HTML 3.2 or HTML 4 Transitional, this is probably the hardest to get used to.  If you are new to HTML, it is the best thing for you to learn to start with.  Either way, future versions of HTML (known as XHTML) will be most like HTML 4.01 Strict, and it is recommended for non-XHTML documents.

We use HTML 4.01 Strict in this book because as of this time (June, 2006) XHTML 1.1 is still unsupported in Microsoft Internet Explorer, which holds the plurality (if not the majority) on the browser market.  Once Microsoft Internet Explorer contains support for the XHTML 1.1 standards, it would be prudent (and logical) to use XHTML 1.1 as the default document type for new web pages and applications.

 &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;

This is HTML 4.01 Transitional, which permits &amp;ldquo;old-style&amp;rdquo; HTML to be written with HTML 4.  Most notably, HTML 4.01 transitional adds presentational and depreciated elements to the HTML 4.01 Strict standard.  It is recommended for use by those who need to make use of elements that are included.  There is a list of elements that are depreciated available [http://www.comptechdoc.org/independent/web/html/guide/htmlcsscat.html on the Internet].

 &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd&quot;&gt;

This is used for frameset pages.  HTML permits frameset pages, which define frames within a browser window, and then load content into those frames.  The use of frames on a page is debated in general, and generally not encouraged.  However, like all rules, there are exceptions.

 &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN&quot;
  &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN&quot;
  &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN&quot;
  &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd&quot;&gt;

These are the XHTML document types.  XHTML is an XML-ified version of HTML.  It is better then HTML, however, full support from Microsoft Internet Explorer is still lacking (as of June 2006), which makes it nonviable at present for use outside of controlled environments{{ref|xhtml_controlled_environment}}.

=== The Content-Type of the Document ===

Every document served on the Internet contains a &amp;ldquo;Content-Type&amp;rdquo; header.  For HTML based web applications, the correct Content-Type header that has to be passed is:

 Content-Type: text/html

It is also recommended that you specify the character set that your application is using.  [[Wikipedia:UTF-8|UTF-8]] is a common choice{{ref|utf_8_unicode}}, since it contains most of the characters that anybody would use in many various languages.  For an application using UTF-8, the proper Content-Type header is:

 Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8

=== What is &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; HTML? ===

There are some basic rules that you can follow to try to make sure that you are consistently writing proper HTML:

* If an element has a close tag, '''use it'''.
* Do not make '''tag-soup'''&amp;mdash;that is, do not start a paragraph with &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and then start a new paragraph with &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; without finishing the first one.
* Use lowercase HTML tags when using HTML 4.01 or any version of XHTML.  Versions of HTML prior to 4.0 use upper-case tags, and are depreciated.
* Avoid in-line &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; attributes.  Use classes and &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; attributes with cascading style sheets to render the effect, instead, if possible.  (Sometimes, one must use inline style information; however, the behavior is technically depreciated&amp;mdash;content and presentation should never be mixed with each other in that way.)
* '''DO NOT''' use XHTML-style empty tags in HTML 4.x documents.  Some browsers (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer) choke on these tags when they are in HTML 4.x documents, and do not know how to parse them.  Results can be unpredictable.
* Use the [http://validator.w3.org/ W3C Validation Service] to validate your work as you go.  If you are working on a project that is internal to an intranet, as opposed to on the public Internet, still take care to validate using the service, though you will need to paste the markup in for validation.
** Some larger corporations (such as [[Wikipedia:AT&amp;T|AT&amp;T]]) may have their own internal copy of a document validator.  When you have such a validator available, '''USE IT'''&amp;mdash;it allows you to verify confidential content that cannot be transmitted across the open Internet.
** If necessary, mirror the W3C validation service locally somehow.

=== What is there to learn from this example? ===

This is essentially a small program that instructs a web browser to display information, with a title that is useful to the user.  It contains all of the proper elements of valid HTML 4.01 Strict, which means that it should render properly in any web browser that supports HTML 4.01 Strict.  This is the smallest document that can be used, and contains no style information (which we will learn about later).

In this example, you have learned about document types (which are required for valid HTML documents), setting the Content-Type header with a character set (which is important to ensure that it is displayed properly, especially if it contains non-[[Wikipedia:ASCII|ASCII]] characters such as ß, ¥, ¶, ©, or ®), and you see the basic structure of an HTML document.  We will build on this information as we go, including the three other examples to come below.

== &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; with PHP ==

In the previous example, you witnessed how HTML 4.01 can stand on its own with regular, static content.  This means that when an HTML document is saved on the web server, as the one above, it will never change without human interaction.  Somebody has to edit and save the file, and then upload it to the server again, for anybody else to witness the change{{ref|file_cache_change}}.
[[image:Elpwad hello php.png|frame|center|Hello, World in PHP]]
In this example, you can see that some of the file has changed.  We have saved the file with a new extension - .php, which tells the server that it has to be handled on the server.  Also, there are new items within the file.  We will take a look at the components that we find in this program.

=== &amp;ldquo;Opening&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Closing&amp;rdquo; PHP ===

PHP files are somewhat strange in the computer world&amp;mdash;the file is actually usually only part PHP.  The rest of the file is whatever the output language is; in our case, this would be HTML 4.01 Strict.  For this to be possible, there has to be a way for the application writer to tell PHP where to start and stop looking for PHP code.

For this, we use the PHP open tag ('''&lt;?php''') to tell PHP to start reading instructions, and the PHP close tag ('''?&gt;''') to tell PHP to stop reading instructions.{{ref|php_open_tag}}  Everything between the start and end tags is read and acted on by PHP.  Everything that is outside of the tags is passed, unobstructed.  On line 1, you see the first PHP open tag, and on line 11, you see the first closing tag.  Everything between them is run by PHP.

=== Comments in PHP ===

The next things that you come across in the Hello, World program above are comments.  There are two different types of comments generally used in PHP.  The first comment we come across is the '''multi-line''' comment, which starts on line 2, and stops on line 5.  This comment starts with '''/*''' and ends with '''*/'''.  These types of comments are borrowed from the C computer language.

Multi-line comments are good for remarks that span multiple lines.  In the example above, we used the multi-line comment for demonstration purposes.  It is generally useful at the header of a file, to give a brief overview of what the file's purpose is.  Some people use the header for information on copyright, license information, and other '''[[Wikipedia:metadata|metadata]]''' that pertains to the file.  Over time, you will develop your own style for how you write code, including how you structure your files within projects.

An example of a header with metadata for a file that manages database connections might look like:

 &lt;?php
 /*
  * Database Library for MySQL
  * Copyright © 2006 Michael B. Trausch, &lt;email@invalid.com&gt;
  * Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3
  */

The second comment that we see, immediately after the first one, is a '''single line''' comment.  This comment starts with the '''//''' characters, and ends at the end of the line.  These types of comments are good for giving short descriptions of the next few lines of code, or a reason for doing something.

The biggest thing to remember about comments is that if they were unnecessary, they would not be included in the language.  It is important to understand that code that is lacking in comments, as well as code that is over-commented, can become hard to read and understand by other people&amp;mdash;or even yourself, later on.  Many programmers understand the code that they are writing at the time, however, when they return to it six months later, do not have a clue why they wrote things the way that they did.  It is important to know when to comment, and when not to.  Over time, you will learn when it is appropriate to place comments in your code.

=== PHP Functions ===

PHP has a large library of '''functions''' that you can use to help your code actually do things.  In the example above, the PHP [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.header.php header()] function is used to send an '''HTTP header''' to the web browser{{ref|php_header_note}}.  This is equivalent (and sometimes, with older browsers, more effective) then the HTML &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; tag that was used in the first example.

PHP has an extremely large number of functions that you as a programmer can call upon.  Fortunately, the [http://www.php.net/manual/en/ PHP Manual] is an extremely easy-to-use resource which classifies the available functions, as well as allowing you to search them.  As a PHP application developer, the PHP Manual can be one of the most important resources you have.  As you go through this book, you will find more PHP functions that we will use.

=== PHP Variables ===

Part of the big deal with web application programming, and PHP in particular, is that you want content to be '''dynamic'''&amp;mdash;you do not want a static set of pages that will never change.  Variables are the cornerstone of dynamic pages.  If PHP did not have variables of any type, it would be extremely hard to make use of other features of the language to help process, store, and retrieve data.

Variables are probably the most used items in PHP, and arguably, any programming or scripting language.  It is important to make sure that you understand what they are, and how they are used.  Variables are containers of data, put bluntly.  Each one of them has a name.  In our example Hello, World script above, our first variable that we create is:

 $hello_text = 'Hello, World!';

All we are doing in this line is assigning the text &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; to the variable that we are calling &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;$hello_text&lt;/span&gt;.  Now, it is possible to change this variable at any time.  We can make the &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;$hello_text&lt;/span&gt; variable hold the text &amp;ldquo;Hello, Betsy!&amp;rdquo; or even the number 42!

We will learn more about variables a little bit later in the book.  For now, it is important to realize that when you are assigning the variable, the name of the variable must be on the left, and the new contents of it must be on the right.  An equal sign goes in-between them.

One more thing that we need to know immediately, is that there are two types of text strings in PHP code.  You may notice that on line 9, we use the single quote, and on line 10 we use the double-quote.  There is a difference between them.  The single quote character (') specifies an absolute literal string.  Anything that is between single-quote marks will be stored '''exactly''' as it appears.

The double-quote, however, is a little bit different.  There are some neat tricks that you can perform with double-quoted strings.  We see one of these tricks on line 10:  we include the contents of one variable, into another.  This is called '''variable interpolation''', and is a common practice in some types of languages.  This is a feature of PHP that you will grow to use quite often in your programs, and you will see it very often in other programmer&amp;rsquo;s code.  Taking a look at line 10:

 $page_title = &quot;$hello_text (PHP Version)&quot;;

We can see that there is a double-quote there.  Since we know (in this case) what &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;$hello_text&lt;/span&gt; contains, we can look at this line, and &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; what PHP gets from it:

 $page_title = 'Hello, World! (PHP Version)';

PHP replaces the reference to &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;$hello_text&lt;/span&gt; with what the contents of &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;$hello_text&lt;/span&gt; were at the time.  We will take a closer look at this later on the book.

=== On Variables: camelCase or underscores? ===

Coding styles differ from project to project, and person to person.  One major issue in coding style is how to name the variables.  You have seen that we have chosen to use underscores—for example, &lt;code&gt;$hello_text&lt;/code&gt;—instead of “camelCasing” (e.g., &lt;code&gt;$helloText&lt;/code&gt;).  The reason for this is experience; the author has found that using camelCasing tends to create situations in many programming languages where it is very easy to type the name of a variable incorrectly, and this can cause problems that are hard to debug and fix.  One example would be if &lt;code&gt;$helloText&lt;/code&gt; were to accidentally be typed as &lt;code&gt;$hellotext&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;$helloTExt&lt;/code&gt;—a common occurrence when the &amp;lt;SHIFT&amp;gt; key is hard to press or sticks—and is not easy to spot when quickly glancing at code to see what the problem might be.

Due to the way that PHP operates, it’s easier to create correct code if camelCasing is avoided.  It may take some time to initially get used to the idea of using underscores to separate words in variable names, but it is a very useful way of ensuring that there is consistency in the way that things are named.  Keep in mind, though, that if you use other people’s code—say someone else’s class libraries—you may find that they have chosen to use camelCasing, and using at least a little bit of it is unavoidable.

Whatever style of casing you use, if you are creating a new Web application with PHP, it is best to describe the coding style in a file contained within the project as an easy point of reference, and remain consistent with it.

== Other Variations of &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; ==

There are a few other ways that we could write the Hello, World program to show you other ways of interacting with the browser and the user.  However, for now, we are going to ignore them:  They use yet another language called &amp;ldquo;JavaScript&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and JavaScript really is deserving of a section all its own.  Remember that this is introductory material, and so we are not diving far deeper then the surface on many of the languages, topics, and concepts that you will find here.{{ref|javascript_comment}}

== Questions ==

Answer the following questions.  Writing the answers down (or typing them out) after thinking about them and reviewing for the answers can help you to better remember the information for use later.  '''After''' you have answered the questions, compare your answers to the ones here in the book.

# Re-write the Hello, World program in PHP to use another variable called &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace;&quot;&gt;$user_name&lt;/span&gt;.  Store your name in that variable, and make the program say &quot;Hello yourname, welcome to the world!&quot; [[/HelloUserWorld-Answer|Answer]]

== Practice ==

We have gone over a great deal of information here.  You are encouraged to do some practicing to help use some of the ideas presented within this page.

# Check out the [http://validator.w3.org/ W3 HTML validation program] available on the Internet.  View your examples in the web browser, and paste the output from your browser&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;View Source&amp;rdquo; option into the validation service.  Remember this tool&amp;mdash;it will be important to you in the future!
# View the [http://www.php.net/manual/en/ PHP Manual] and get a feel for how to get around it.  This is another important resource that you will use often in development.

== Footnotes ==

# {{note|xhtml_controlled_environment}}XHTML 1.0 Transitional may be used with a text/html Content-Type header, however, there are restrictions on how it can be done.  More information on XHTML is available in the [[../Appendices/XHTML|XHTML Appendix]].
# {{note|utf_8_unicode}}UTF-8 is an eight bit character set which represents Unicode characters among computer systems.  Unicode is used as standard in many installations of operating systems, and is capable of representing the entire Unicode character set standard.  More information on UTF-8 is [[Wikipedia:UTF-8|available on Wikipedia]].
# {{note|file_cache_change}}Sometimes, the new changes will not be picked up immediately by a web browser that has previously viewed the document.  The example used in Section 2 may be changed to read &amp;ldquo;Hello, User!&amp;rdquo; and it may not be picked up right away.  We will see later in this book how to combat that problem, as it is a problem that all web applications have to deal with.
# {{note|php_open_tag}}There is also a short PHP open tag ('''&lt;?''' ... '''?&gt;''').  However, it is not guaranteed to be enabled on all systems.  Furthermore, it is possible that if enabled, it can interfere with XHTML documents.  (XHTML Proper has to start with '''&lt;?xml...?&gt;''', and PHP sees the '''&lt;?''' as the short start tag.)  There more information listed in the [[../Appendices/XHTML|XHTML Appendix]].
# {{note|php_header_note}}The PHP [http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.header.php header] function is used to send '''any''' HTTP header to the web browser.  This function must be used before any other output in your program.  It is an extremely popular function, and we will see more on it later in this book.
# {{note|javascript_comment}}JavaScript is a slightly more complex subject because it runs on the client-side (in your user&amp;rsquo;s web browser).  You can, however, write perfect web applications without the use of JavaScript.  We will be bringing JavaScript in a little bit later, after we have nailed some of the different programming concepts in PHP and HTML programming, since many will carry over.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Team Cohesion Defined==
One definition of cohesion is “a group property with individual manifestations of feelings of belongingness or attraction to the group” (Lieberman et al., 1973: 337).  It is generally accepted that group cohesion and performance are associated.  “However, the issue of a cause/effect relationship between group cohesion and performance is not completely resolved. Generally, there tend to be more studies supporting a positive relationship between group cohesion and performance.”  {{ref|Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann. 2003}}  With that in mind the following article is an effort to enhance group/team cohesion and as a result help improve group/team performance.

== The Question ==
What is team cohesiveness and why does it matter to an organization to have cohesiveness within its teams?

== Team Composition ==
=== How to promote team cohesion when selecting and identifying diversity within teams ===
In their journal article Beyond Relational Demography: Time and the Effects of Surface- and Deep-Level Diversity on Work Group Cohesion, David A. Harrison, Kenneth H. Price, and Myrtle P. Bell discuss the composition of teams and its effect on cohesiveness.  They describe two different categories of diversity, namely surface level and deeper level.

=== Surface-Level Diversity: ===
Surface level attributes are “immutable [and] almost immediately observable.” {{ref|Milliken &amp; Martins, 1996}}  Such attributes include age, sex, and race/ethnicity.  In general, the findings have been fairly inconsistent within and across studies as to how diversity in these areas affect team cohesion.

=== Deep-Level Diversity: ===
Deep-level diversity includes differences among members’ attitudes, beliefs, and values.   These attributes are less apparent than surface-level differences and are “learned through extended, individualized interaction and information gathering.” {{ref|Harrison, Price &amp; Bell, 1998}}  They are communicated differences which are shared through both verbal and nonverbal behavior.  There has been less research done in this area with regards to teams in workplace settings, though a number of social psychological studies have been conducted.   The findings consistently suggest that “attitudinal similarity [is] associated with higher group cohesiveness.” {{ref|Terborg, Castore, &amp; DeNinno, 1976}}  Diversity also improves communication, reduces personal conflict, attracts friendships, and gives more satisfaction to group members. 

=== Summary ===
Overall, the school of thought that is most widely accepted, in regards to team cohesion, is that “surface-level differences are less important and deep-level differences are more important for groups that had interacted more often” {{ref|Harrison, Price &amp; Bell, 1998}}.  Harrison, Price, and Bell’s study concluded that while homogeneous groups interacted and performed more effectively than heterogeneous groups in the beginning, with time and information, the diverse groups’ performance and processes improved more rapidly and “had grown more effective in identifying problems and generating solutions” {{ref|Harrison, Price &amp; Bell, 1998}}.  Overall cohesiveness was strengthened in such cases.  Hence, for optimum results, teams ought to include deep-level diversity as part of the process for achieving cohesiveness.


== Internal Environment Factors Needed in Team Cohesion ==
Internally there are several factors that must be present for cohesion to exist within a team. First good and appropriate communication is essential to creating and maintaining cohesion. Communication leads to the second factor, unity of purpose. For a team to work as a cohesive team they must share a common goal and to collectively work towards that goal. And finally, the team must have a high level of commitment understanding that what they do together as a team is better than what they do on their own.

=== Communication ===
In the article “Building Team Cohesion: Becoming “We” Instead of “Me” the authors stress the importance of not losing the “human moment” which they define as “not to lose the powerful impact of face-to-face, immediate interaction in real time and space.” Furthermore, the authors add the following:
: “It is communication in the “human moment” that most powerfully creates team synergy – the energy that truly makes “the whole greater than the sum of its parts.” It is communication in the “human moment” that also most powerfully creates team cohesion – a strong sense of loyalty and commitment to the team vision as one’s own.”
: “Providing communication opportunities in real time and space for forensics team members is necessary to build team cohesion. Whether a room or lounge where team members can congregate between classes and the end of the day, practice space for formal and informal coaching sessions, travel time in cars and vans, or social time to enjoy pizza and a movie, both quantity and quality of communication are necessary to build a cohesive team climate of openness and trust…According to Bormann(1990), highly cohesive groups interact in an open climate where individuals are free to ask questions and disagree with one another; even the ability to work through inevitable team conflict in such a constructive climate will only serve to strengthen team cohesion.”

In order to build cohesion within any team whether it be a sports team or work team communication is an essential ingredient. Providing opportunities for the team members to interact socially is necessary to help build trust. In addition, a safe environment in which the team can deal with conflict is critical to team cohesion.

=== Unity of Purpose or a Common Goal ===
A critical factor that must be present for groups or teams to experience cohesion is to have a common goal. In SELF-MANAGING WORK TEAMS:An Empirical Study of Group Cohesiveness in “Natural Work Groups” at a Harley-Davidson Motor Company Plant, the authors state: “that highly cohesive groups tend
to perform better because they have high commitment to attaining group goals (e.g., Stogdill, 1972), and because the members are more sensitive to others in the group, they are more willing to assist each other (e.g., Schachter, Ellertson, McBride,&amp;Gregory, 1951).”

Additional support to the importance of a common goal in building and maintaining a common goal is found in “Buliding Team Cohesion: Becoming “We” Instead of “Me” where the author relates the following: 
: “Since cohesion is believed to be one of the distinguishing characteristics of a high-performance team, what is this powerful team quality and how is it cre-ated? According to Bollen and Hoyle (1979), cohesion is the degree of attraction members feel toward one another and the team; &quot;it is a feeling of deep loyalty, of esprit de corps, the degree to which each individual has made the team's goal his or her own, a sense of belonging, and a feeling of morale&quot; (as cited in Beebe &amp; Masterson, 2000, p. 122). Though cohesion is rooted in the feelings team mem-bers have for one another as well as a common goal, creating, shaping, and strengthening those feelings relies on the use of effective communication. Communication scholars have long agreed that group or team cohesion is as much about the relationships created as the task at hand, and success in both fos-ters the development of team cohesion. (Bormann, 1990).

Without a purpose or a common goal a team will eventually splinter into separate individuals working towards their own personal agendas and not together toward a team goal. It is important for team members to see themselves as a part of the group working towards a goal for cohesiveness to exist.

=== Commitment ===

Teams that are not committed to each other or a common goal do not experience cohesion and are much more like to leave the team or even the organization. In the article &quot;Commitment and the Control of Organizational Behavior and Belief&quot; the author states the following:
: &quot;Commitment also derives from the relation of an employee's job to those of other in the organization. Some jobs are rather isolated and can be done independently of other jobs in the organization. It has been found that jobs which are not integrated with the work activities of others tend to be associated with less favorable attitudes. (Sheperd, 1973). Gow, Clarkand dossett (1974), for instance find that telephone operators who quit tend to be those who are not integrated into the work group. Work integration can affect commitment by the fact that integrated jobs are likely to be associated with salient demands from others in the organization. If a person has a job which affects the work of others in the organization, it is likely that those other will communicate their expectations for performance of that job. Such expectations can be committing in that the other people implicitly or explicitly hold the person accountable for what he does. Earlier we mentioned that when individuals did not know what was expected of them they tended to be less committed to the organization. One reason an individual will not know what is expected is because no one is telling him. In general, we would expect that anything which contributes to creating definite expectations for a person's behavior would enhance his felt responsibility, and hence commitment.&quot;

We learn from the above author that for commitment to exist we employees need to know what is expected of them and then to know they will be held accountable either by a manager or other co-workers. Once commitment is present team members are more likely to stay and work towards the team goal.

== Role of Management in Team Cohesion ==
The roles that management has in a team that they oversee are extremely important. But it is also important for the management to understand the boundaries of what their roles and responsibilities are and what the roles and responsibilities of the team itself are. The manager is often placed in the management position because of their people and technical skills and experience. A team often benefits from the manager’s abilities, skills, aptitudes, insights and ideas. But neither the management nor the team should ever forget that it is the team’s responsibility to perform the actual work. So what role should management play in a team that they oversee? How best can they serve the team to ensure they are successful? A critical role that management can and should have is to facilitate and encourage team cohesion.

=== Establish the Team Vision/Goal ===
The first step in creating team cohesion and where management should be involved is in the establishment of the team vision and/or goal. Management must set a clear vision to which the team can jointly work towards together. As Tommy Lasorda, former manager of the LA Dodgers, stated, “My responsibility is to get my 25 guys playing for the name on the front of their shirt and not the one on the back.”{{ref|LaFasto}} Management must “establish a common goal for [the] team – an underlying target that will bind [them] together…”{{ref|LaFasto}} The goal must be as clear as possible for each member of the team. “Goal clarity is critical for team members to have confidence in their direction and to be committed to make it happen.”{{ref|LaFasto}} A clearly defined goal articulated to the team in such a way that they all understand will inspire the team and commit them to the cause.

Once the goal has been clearly defined and clearly articulated, management must keep the vision and goal alive. Obstacles, tension, and crises may arise that can distract or discourage away from the common goal. The management must “continually reinforce and renew the team goal.”{{ref|LaFasto}}

Being that managements “primary responsibility is to ensure that the team reaches its goal,”{{ref|LaFasto}} management must also facilitate a working environment, set clear expectations and responsibilities, and lastly, let the team do their job.

=== Facilitate a Working Environment ===
Once the team vision and goal has been established, the most important contribution management can make “is to ensure a climate that enables team members to speak up and address the real issues preventing the goal from being achieved.”{{ref|LaFasto}} Such a climate includes creating an environment of trust, communication and openness with each other. As Frank Lafasto describes in his book, openness and supportiveness are “the ability to raise and resolve the real issues standing the way of a team accomplishing its goal. And to do so in a way that brings out the best thinking and attitude of everyone involved. It’s too hard for team members to contribute, much less explore the possibilities, when it is not safe for them to say what’s on their minds. They must be able to speak honestly. They must be able to deal openly with real obstacles, problems, and opportunities in a way that promotes listening, understanding of differing perspectives, and constructively working towards a solution.”{{ref|LaFasto}}
The environment and climate in which the team works and operates must be facilitated by the management to ensure that trust is established, collective collaboration is demanded, and openness is welcome.

=== Set Clear Expectations and Responsibilities ===
Management responsibility is also to set clear expectations and responsibilities of the team and individual team members. Patrick Lencioni describes in his book “The Five Dysfunctions of a Team” that a team where there is ambiguity about the direction and priorities fails to commit. Whereas when the expectations, direction and priorities are clear the team is more likely to commit to the cause and each other.{{ref|Lencioni}} Management must establish clear expectations so there is no ambiguity or question of what is expected of the team, whether it is the timeline, product, requirements, etc.

Also, management must set clear responsibilities. “There are few behaviors that build confidence as well as personalized expression of belief in an individual. One of the most direct signals of such belief is trusting someone with important and meaningful responsibility.”{{ref|LaFasto}} Clear and meaningful responsibility that allows the team members to stretch enhances their trust and confidence. And, as Jack Welch, the CEO of General Electric, put it, “giving people self-confidence is by far the most important thing I can do. Because then they will act.”{{ref|LaFasto}}

=== Training and Staffing ===
According to Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann to get a task completed, “a work team must have the resources to do the job.  Specifically, the team needs trained, competent team members. Training is a planned effort by a firm to help employees learn job-related competencies (Noe, 1999). Training is used by companies to gain a competitive advantage over rivals in their respective industries. A company must provide adequate resources to an empowered team to staff and train its members adequately.”  It is the responsibility of Management to provide such training. Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann also suggest management should provide its workers with both “hard” and “soft” skills. “Hard-skills training helps them do their jobs properly so that the plant can produce a quality product cost-effectively. Soft-skills training, on the other hand, teaches the workers to get along better as part of a functioning team; this type of skills training improves interpersonal dynamics and relationships. To effectively and efficiently manufacture quality product, both types of training are needed.” {{ref|Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann 2003}}  It is therefore the responsibility of management to make sure that group/ team members have the hard and soft skills to perform tasks and maintain cohesion.

=== Get Out of Their Way ===
And lastly, the manager’s role is to get out of the team’s way. Once the team knows what they are working towards, tasks have been clearly defined and delegated, expectations are clearly set and they have the means to build relationships of trust and have open communication, the manager needs to step back and let the team work. The last thing the team needs, not only to reach their goal, but also to build strong cohesion is, as Dr. Travis Bradberry described, a seagull manager; one that swoops in when problems arise “squawking and dumpling advice, only to take off and let others clean up the mess.”{{ref|Bradberry}} Management needs to let the members in the team be smart and informed about key issues and facts related to their tasks and goal. Then management must trust team members by providing sufficient autonomy, which will in turn build confidence.

=== Summary ===
Ultimately, the goal and role of management should be to add value to the team’s effort. This can be done by defining a clear vision and goal, facilitate a working environment, set clear expectations and responsibilities, and provide the team enough autonomy where they can work and do their jobs with full commitment and confidence.


== Examples of Team Cohesion: The Good ==
A good example of team Cohesion is that of the Harley Davidson Motor Company (HDMC) and its group structure.  The well known turnaround of HDMC occurred in the 1980s when it changed from a “command-and-control” culture to that of self-managing work teams (SMWT).  This change allowed assembly employees to make important decisions in their work teams {{ref|Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann}}.  With group work as the foundation of HDMC’s manufacturing cohesion among group members was essential.   

At its Kansas City Plant HDMC natural work groups (NWG) were organized to make decisions (and build motorcycles).  The plant’s employees are made up of local union members.  “This partnership allows the shifting of the decision-making and financial responsibilities for the operation of the plant to the assembly floor employees” {{ref|Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann}}.     

The structure of the plant divides workers into NWGs.  Each NWG is either assigned to one of four process operations groups (POG) (the Assembly POG, the Fabrication POG, the Paint POG, or a POG dedicated to future programs) or provides “computer, human resources, materials, and so forth, support for the operations NWGs (denoted as RG or Resource Groups).  Each of the NWGs is represented by NWG-elected (on a rotating basis) members. The highest level of the circular organization is the lone plant leadership group (PLG), which is cochaired by the plant manager and two local union presidents” {{ref|Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann}}.

Within this group structure HDMC provides for widespread access to information. “All financial and operations information is available to all team members, which allows them to monitor budgets and production quotas” {{ref|Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann}}.  This access to information facilitates open communication which in turn leads to greater team cohesion.  Cohesion is also furthered by the autonomy of workers within the group. “Each NWG is empowered to make decisions with regard to any aspect of the assembly process as long as it does not cross over its boundary and impede another NWG” {{ref|Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann}}.  With freedom to make any necessary decisions and freedom from continuous managerial intervention NWGs are free to bend and move as needed in response to any given situation.    
  
Interestingly in this structure there are no formal team leaders.  “NWGs are collectively led by the members of the group. Traditional leadership duties such as scheduling, safety monitoring, budget balancing, and so forth, are rotated among the NWG members on a regular basis (usually monthly). The NWG controls its own budget, sick pay, overtime, and consumable production materials.  Individual performance measures are not maintained. The NWG performance is measured on achievement of plant goals and on the goals that they set for themselves” {{ref|Chansler, Swamidass, &amp; Cammann}}.  This sharing of responsibilities fosters cohesion by aligning the goals of the group, goals each member is included in creating.  


== Examples of Team Cohesion: The Bad ==

The 2010 film “The Social Network” is based on the events and circumstances that lead to the creation and founding of the social networking website “Facebook.”  Founder Mark Zuckerberg and his friend, co-founder Eduardo Saverin agree to launch the site and split up ownership of the new company equitably.  In the process of developing the company, other individuals and interests come into play that are detrimental to the team cohesion developed by Mark and Eduardo eventually leading to multi-million dollar lawsuits and the end of the original founding team. 

Several factors that lead to the failure of team cohesion:

:* Team members were unable to work together cooperatively
:* Team goals were not shared by everyone on the team
:* Team members felt that they were not recognized for individual contributions to accomplish team goals
:* Selfish interests were able to infiltrate the team cohesion


The fact that team members were unable to work cooperatively together is likely the single biggest factor in the failure of the original “Facebook” leadership team.  In the movie, to help advance the growth of the company, Mark brought in a third partner, Sean Parker, the co-founder of the famous music sharing sight “Napster.”  Mark was instantly drawn to Sean’s charismatic personality and vision for “Facebook.”  At the same time, Eduardo was highly skeptical of Sean and his business history.  Immediately Mark began to lean toward the ideas that Sean had developed for “Facebook” and eventually gave Sean a small ownership stake in the company as well as a management position.  Upon learning this, Eduardo was very upset that Mark would go ahead and make the decision to include Sean without consulting him first. 

Mark and Eduardo both had visions of keeping this site exclusive for the elite college institutions around the country and gradually introducing it to other colleges.  When Sean was brought into the company he presented Mark with a business plan to expand “Facebook” beyond the college scene and introduce it to the general public.  At the same time he was trying to convince Mark that he needed to relocate the business to Palo Alto, CA from Boston, MA.  Eduardo was never consulted on these propositions that were made to Mark.  Eduardo felt like Sean was trying to push him out of the company and influence many of the decisions made by Mark.  As the company grew and others were able to influence decision making, the team goals had clearly changed and not everyone shared the same vision.

When “Facebook” was originally started Eduardo was designated as the CFO of the company.  In this responsibility he put up the initial seed money to get it off the ground.  He was in charge of all finances and bank accounts for the company.  While Mark was moving the company headquarters to Palo Alto, Eduardo was spending time in New York working on securing advertising contracts with prominent advertising firms.  When Eduardo goes to visit the team in Palo Alto he begins to tell Mark all about the progress he has made with the advertisers but instead he is told all about the work that Sean and Mark had accomplished and is essentially told that his time and work in New York will not be needed.  Eduardo felt like his contributions to the company and goals were not being recognized.  This drives Eduardo further and further from the team.

Throughout the life of the original leadership team there were many occasions where selfish interests were able to infiltrate team cohesion.  Sean was the worst offender of this.  Sean was one of the founders of “Napster.”  “Napster” was eventually forced to shut down and was facing many lawsuits from the record industry.  Sean saw an opportunity to work with Mark and Eduardo on “Facebook.”  Sean could see the potential that this venture had and also that he could influence the socially introverted Mark by filling him with visions of big pay days and a life style full of privilege.  At times he appeared to try and relive his days of “Napster” and treated “Facebook” like it was his own company and he was trying to accomplish the goals there that weren’t achievable at “Napster.”  After a party to celebrate the 1 millionth member of “Facebook,” Sean was arrested with several other “Facebook” interns for possession of cocaine and was eventually dismissed from the company.  Through these actions, Sean clearly was acting in his own self interest and did not take into account what the effects would be on the group or company.  In many ways the selfish actions of Sean drove a wedge between Mark and Eduardo that eventually lead to lawsuits and the end of the original leadership team. {{ref|The Social Network}}


==Conclusion==
===Ways to Increase Team Cohesion===  
Each group environment is different and will present different challenges.  In order to create a cohesive team unit it is important for team members to be aware of this and work towards it.  In Joseph Powell Stokes’s research, he found that “risk taking that occurs in a group, attraction to individual members of the group, and the instrumental value of a group are all related to the cohesion of the group”.  He proposes that “increasing risk taking, intermember attraction, and the instrumental value of a personal change group might lead to increased cohesion, which in turn might lead to increase benefits for group participants.” {{ref|Stokes}}  

As such, groups should attempt to foster an “atmosphere of tolerance and acceptance” so they can assure openness and honesty and hence, increase their risk taking and intermember attraction.  They can “[reward] members who make risky self-disclosures or give honest feedback to other group members”.  They should make sure group members know that they are expected to “like each other” and can help members “differentiate between not liking other members’ behaviors and not liking the other members themselves”.  Group leaders ought to act as examples and make sure that the group composition and expectations of the group members are in line with risk-taking and intermember attraction. “Leaders can maximize the instrumental value of a group for its members by having the group focus explicitly on its goals and by helping redirect the group when members’ needs are not being met”. {{ref|Stokes}}

===Potential problems===
One possible caveat of cohesion is that when there is too much cohesion, groups are prone to groupthink.  “Groupthink is a tendency by groups to engage in a concurrence seeking manner. Groupthink occurs when group members give priority to sustaining concordance and internal harmony above critical examination of the issues under consideration”. {{ref|Groupthink}} It is important for all group members to be conscious of this pitfall and to take precautions to prevent such behavior.

__NOTOC__

[[w:Nuclear Medicine|Nuclear Medicine]] is a fascinating application of [[W:Nuclear_physics|nuclear physics]]. The first ten chapters of this wikibook are intended to support a basic introductory course in an early semester of an undergraduate program.  They assume that students have completed decent high school programs in maths and physics and are concurrently taking subjects in the medical sciences.  Additional chapters cover more advanced topics in this field. Our focus in this wikibook is the diagnostic application of Nuclear Medicine. Therapeutic applications are considered in a separate [[Radiation_Oncology/Physics|wikibook, &quot;Radiation Oncology&quot;]].

A companion wikibook on the [[Basic_Physics_of_Digital_Radiography|Basic Physics of Digital Radiography]] is also available.

You will have encountered much of what we will cover here in your high school physics.  We are going to review this material again below so as to set the context for subsequent chapters.  This chapter will also provide you with an opportunity to check your understanding of this topic.

The chapter covers atomic structure, nuclear structure, the classification of nuclei, binding energy and nuclear stability.

== Atomic Structure ==


The [[W:Atom|atom]] is considered to be the basic building block of all matter.  Simple atomic theory tells us that it  consists of two components:  a [[W:Atomic_nucleus|nucleus]] surrounded by an [[W:Electron_cloud|electron cloud]].  The situation can be considered as being similar in some respects to planets orbiting the sun.  

From an electrical point of view, the nucleus is said to be positively charged and the electrons negatively charged.

From a size point of view, the radius of an atom is about 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; m while the radius of a nucleus is about 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; m, i.e. about ten thousand times smaller.  The situation could be viewed as something like a cricket ball, representing the nucleus, in the middle of a sporting arena with the electrons orbiting somewhere around where the spectators would sit.  This perspective tells us that the atom should be composed mainly of empty space.  However, the situation is far more complex than this simple picture portrays in that we must also take into account the physical forces which bind the atom together. 

[[W:Chemistry|Chemical phenomena]] can be thought of as interactions between the electrons of individual atoms.  [[W:Radioactive_decay|Radioactivity]] on the other hand can be thought of as changes which occur within the nuclei of atoms.

== The Nucleus ==

A simple description of the nucleus tells us that it is composed of [[W:Proton|protons]] and [[W:Neutron|neutrons]].  These two particle types are collectively called '''nucleons''', i.e. particles which inhabit the nucleus.

From a mass point of view the mass of a proton is roughly equal to the mass of a neutron and each of these is about 2,000 times the mass of an electron.  So most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in the small region at its core.

From an electrical point of view the proton is positively charged and the neutron has no charge.  An atom all on its own (if that were possible to achieve!) is electrically neutral.  The number of protons in the nucleus of such an atom must therefore equal the number of electrons orbiting that atom.&lt;br /&gt;

== Classification of Nuclei ==

The term '''Atomic Number''' is defined in nuclear physics as the number of protons in a nucleus and is given the symbol '''Z'''.  From your chemistry you will remember that this number also defines the position of an element in the [[W:Periodic_table|Periodic Table of Elements]].

The term '''Mass Number''' is defined as the number of nucleons in a nucleus, that is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons, and is given the symbol '''A'''.

Note that the symbols here are a bit odd, in that it would prevent some confusion if the Atomic Number were given the symbol A, and the Mass Number were given another symbol, such as M, but its not a simple world!

It is possible for nuclei of a given element to have the same number of protons but differing numbers of neutrons, that is to have the same Atomic Number but different Mass Numbers.  Such nuclei are referred to as '''Isotopes'''.  All elements have isotopes and the number ranges from three for hydrogen to over 30 for elements such as caesium and barium.

Chemistry has a relatively simple way of classifying the different elements by the use of symbols such as H for hydrogen, He for helium and so on.  The classification scheme used to identify different isotopes is based on this approach with the use of a superscript before the chemical symbol to denote the Mass Number along with a subscript before the chemical symbol to denote the Atomic Number.  In other words an isotope is identified as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{Z}}^{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where X is the chemical symbol of the element;
A is the &quot;Mass Number,&quot; (protons+ neutrons);
Z is the &quot;Atomic Number,&quot; (number identifying the element on the periodic chart).

Let us take the case of [[W:Hydrogen|hydrogen]] as an example.  It has three isotopes:

*  the most common one consisting of a single proton orbited by one electron, 
*  a second isotope consisting of a nucleus containing a proton and a neutron orbited by one electron, 
*  a third whose nucleus consists of one proton and two neutrons, again orbited by a single electron.  

A simple illustration of these isotopes is shown below.  Remember though that this is a simplified illustration given what we noted earlier about the size of a nucleus compared with that of an atom.  But the illustration is nevertheless useful for showing how isotopes are classified.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM2 6Ani.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;


The first isotope commonly called '''hydrogen''' has a Mass Number of 1, an Atomic Number of 1 and hence is identified as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_1^1\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The second isotope commonly called '''deuterium''' has a Mass Number of 2, an Atomic Number of 1 and is identified as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_1^2\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The third isotope commonly called '''tritium''' is identified as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_1^3\mathbf{H}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The same classification scheme is used for all isotopes.  For example, you should now be able to figure out that the uranium isotope, &lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{236}\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; , contains 92 protons and 144 neutrons.

A final point on classification is that we can also refer to individual isotopes by giving the name of the element followed by the Mass Number.  For example, we can refer to deuterium as hydrogen-2 and we can refer to &lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{236}\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;  as uranium-236.

Before we leave this classification scheme let us further consider the difference between chemistry and nuclear physics.  You will remember that the water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded with an oxygen atom.  Theoretically if we were to combine atoms of hydrogen and oxygen in this manner many, many of billions of times we could make a glass of water.  We could also make our glass of water using deuterium instead of hydrogen.  This second glass of water would theoretically be very similar from a chemical perspective.  However, from a physics perspective our second glass would be heavier than the first since each deuterium nucleus is about twice the mass of each hydrogen nucleus.  Indeed water made in this fashion is called '''heavy water'''.

== Atomic Mass Unit ==

The conventional unit of mass, the [[W:Kilogram|kilogram]], is rather large for use in describing characteristics of nuclei.  For this reason, a special unit called the [[W:Atomic_mass_unit|Atomic Mass Unit]] (amu) is often used.  This unit is sometimes defined as 1/12th of the mass of the stable most commonly occurring isotope of carbon, i.e. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C.  In terms of grams, 1 amu is equal to 1.66 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-24&lt;/sup&gt; g, that is, just over one million, million, million millionth of a gram.

The masses of the proton, m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and neutron, m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; on this basis are:

&lt;center&gt;m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;	=	1.00783 amu&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;	=	1.00866 amu&lt;/center&gt;

while that of the electron is just 0.00055 amu.

== Binding Energy ==

We are now in a position to consider the subject of nuclear stability.  From what we have covered so far, we have seen that the nucleus is a tiny region in the centre of an atom and that it is composed of neutrally and positively charged particles.  So, in a large nucleus such as that of uranium (Z=92) we have a large number of positively charged protons concentrated into a tiny region in the centre of the atom.  An obvious question which arises is that with all these positive charges in close proximity, why doesn't the nucleus fly apart?  How can a nucleus remain as an entity with such electrostatic repulsion between the components?  Should the orbiting negatively-charged electrons not attract the protons away from the atoms centre?

Let us take the case of the [[W:Helium-4|helium-4]] nucleus as an example.  This nucleus contains two protons and two neutrons so that in terms of amu we can figure out from what we covered earlier that the

				&lt;center&gt;mass of 2 protons	=	2.01566 amu,&lt;/center&gt;
and the
				&lt;center&gt;mass of 2 neutrons	=	2.01732 amu.&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore we would expect the total mass of the nucleus to be 4.03298 amu.

The experimentally determined mass of a helium-4 nucleus is a bit less - just 4.00260 amu.  In other words there is a difference of 0.03038 amu between what we might expect as the mass of this nucleus and what we actually measure.  You might think of this difference as very small at just 0.75%.  But remember that since the mass of one electron is 0.00055 amu the difference is actually equivalent to the mass of about 55 electrons.  Therefore it is significant enough to wonder about.

It is possible to consider that this missing mass is converted to energy which is used to hold the nucleus together; it is converted to a form of energy called '''Binding Energy'''.  You could say, as with all relationships, energy must be expended in order to maintain them!

Like the gram in terms of the mass of nuclei, the common unit of energy, the [[W:Joule|joule]] is rather cumbersome when we consider the energy needed to bind a nucleus together.  The unit used to express energies on the atomic scale is the '''electron volt''', symbol: eV.

One [[W:Electron-volt|electron volt]] is defined as the amount of energy gained by an electron as it falls through a potential difference of one volt.  This definition on its own is not of great help to us here and it is stated purely for the sake of completeness.  So do not worry about it for the time being.  Just appreciate that it is a unit representing a tiny amount of energy which is useful on the atomic scale.  It is a bit too small in the case of binding energies however and the mega-electron volt (MeV) is often used.

[[W:Einstein|Albert Einstein]] introduced us to the equivalence of mass, m, and energy, E, at the atomic level using the following equation:

&lt;center&gt;E = m c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ,&lt;/center&gt;

where c is the [[W:Velocity_of_light|velocity of light]].

It is possible to show that 1 amu is equivalent to 931.48 MeV.  Therefore, the mass difference we discussed earlier between the expected and measured mass of the helium-4 nucleus of 0.03038 amu is equivalent to about 28 MeV.  This represents about 7 MeV for each of the four nucleons contained in the nucleus.

== Nuclear Stability ==

In most stable isotopes the [[W:Binding_Energy|binding energy]] per nucleon lies between 7 and 9 MeV.  There are two competing forces in the nuclei, electrostatic repulsion between protons and the attractive nuclear force between nucleons (protons and neutrons).  The electrostatic force is a long range force that becomes more difficult to compensate for as more protons are added to the nucleus.  The nuclear force, which arises as the residual strong force (the strong force binds the quarks together within a nucleon), is a short range force that only operates on a very short distance scale (~ 1.5 fm) as it arises from a Yukawa potential.  (Electromagnetism is a long range force as the force carrier, the photon, is massless; the nuclear force is a short range force as the force carrier, the pion, is massive).  Therefore, larger nuclei tend to be less stable, and require a larger ratio of neutrons to protons (which contribute to the attractive strong force, but not the long-range electrostatic repulsion).  For the low Z nuclides the ratio of neutrons to protons is approximately 1, though it gradually increases to about 1.5 for the higher Z nuclides as shown below on the '''Nuclear Stability Curve'''.

[[Image:NM2_9.gif|thumb|The nuclear stability curve.]]

In other words to combat the effect of the increase in electrostatic repulsion when the number of protons increases the number of neutrons must increase more rapidly to contribute sufficient energy to bind the nucleus together.

As we noted earlier there are a number of isotopes for each element of the Periodic Table.  It has been found that the most stable isotope for each element has a specific number of neutrons in its nucleus.  Plotting a graph of the number of protons against the number of neutrons for these stable isotopes generates what is called the '''Nuclear Stability Curve''':

Note that the number of protons equals the number of neutrons for small nuclei.  But notice also that the number of neutrons increases more rapidly than the number of protons as the size of the nucleus gets bigger so as to maintain the stability of the nucleus.  In other words more neutrons need to be there to contribute to the binding energy used to counteract the electrostatic repulsion between the protons.

== Radioactivity ==

There are about 2,450 known isotopes of the approximately one hundred elements in the Periodic Table.  You can imagine the size of a [[W:Isotope_table_%28complete%29|table of isotopes]] relative to that of the Periodic Table!  The unstable isotopes lie above or below the Nuclear Stability Curve.  These unstable isotopes attempt to reach the stability curve by splitting into fragments, in a process called '''Fission''', or by emitting particles and/or energy in the form of radiation.  This latter process is called '''Radioactivity'''.

It is useful to dwell for a few moments on the term radioactivity.  For example what has nuclear stability to do with radio?  From a historical perspective remember that when these radiations were discovered about 100 years ago we did not know exactly what we were dealing with.  When people like [[W:Henri_Becquerel|Henri Becquerel]] and [[W:Marie_Curie|Marie Curie]] were working initially on these strange emanations from certain natural materials it was thought that the radiations were somehow related to another phenomenon which also was not well understood at the time - that of radio communication.  It seems reasonable on this basis to appreciate that some people considered that the two phenomena were somehow related and hence that the materials which emitted radiation were termed ''radio-active''.

We know today that the two phenomena are not directly related but we nevertheless hold onto the term radioactivity for historical purposes.  But it should be quite clear to you having reached this stage of this chapter that the term radioactive refers to the emission of particles and/or energy from unstable isotopes.  Unstable isotopes for instance those that have too many protons to remain a stable entity are called '''radioactive isotopes''' - and called '''radioisotopes''' for short.  The term '''radionuclide''' is also sometimes used.

Finally about 300 of the 2,450-odd isotopes mentioned above are found in nature.  The rest are man-made, that is they are produced artificially.  These 2,150 or so artificial isotopes have been made during the last 100 years or so with most having been made since the second world war.

We will return to the production of radioisotopes in a [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Production_of_Radioisotopes|later chapter]] of this wikibook and will proceed for the time being with a description of the types of radiation emitted by radioisotopes.

We saw in the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Atomic_%26_Nuclear_Structure|last chapter]] that radioactivity is a process used by unstable nuclei to achieve a more stable situation.  It is said that such nuclei ''decay'' in an attempt to achieve stability.  So, an alternative title for this chapter is '''Nuclear Decay Processes'''.  

We also saw in the previous chapter that we can use the Nuclear Stability Curve as a means of describing what is going on.  So a second alternative title for this chapter is '''Methods of Getting onto the Nuclear Stability Curve'''.

We are going to follow a descriptive or phenomenological approach to the topic here by describing in a fairly simple fashion what is known about each of the major decay mechanisms.  Once again you may have already covered this material in high school physics.  But bear with us because the treatment here will help us set the scene for subsequent chapters.

== Methods of Radioactive Decay ==

Rather than considering what happens to individual nuclei it is perhaps easier to consider a hypothetical nucleus that can undergo many of the major forms of radioactive decay.  This hypothetical nucleus is shown below:

[[File:Radioactive decay.gif|thumb|320px|center|A hypothetical nucleus which can undergo many forms of radioactive decay.]]

Firstly we can see two protons and two neutrons being emitted together in a process called '''alpha-decay'''.  Secondly, we can see that a proton can release a positron in a process called '''beta-plus decay''', and that a neutron can emit an electron in a process called '''beta-minus decay'''.  We can also see an electron being captured by a proton.  Thirdly we can see some energy (a photon) being emitted which results from a process called '''gamma-decay''' as well as an electron being attracted into the nucleus and being ejected again.  Finally there is the rather catastrophic process where the nucleus cracks in half called '''spontaneous fission'''.

We will now describe each of these decay processes in turn.

== Spontaneous Fission ==

This is a very destructive process which occurs in some heavy nuclei which split into 2 or 3 fragments plus some neutrons.  These fragments form new nuclei which are usually radioactive.  [[W:Nuclear_reactors|Nuclear reactors]] exploit this phenomenon for the production of radioisotopes.  Its also used for nuclear power generation and in nuclear weaponry.  The process is not of great interest to us here and we will say no more about it for the time being.

== Alpha Decay ==

In this decay process two protons and two neutrons leave the nucleus together in an assembly known as an '''alpha particle'''.  Note that an [[W:Alpha_particles|alpha particle]] is really a helium-4 nucleus.

So why not call it a helium nucleus?  Why give it another name?  The answer to this question lies in the history of the discovery of radioactivity.  At the time when these radiations were discovered we didn't know what they really were.  We found out that one type of these radiations had a double positive charge and it was not until sometime later that we learned that they were in fact nuclei of helium-4.  In the initial period of their discovery this form of radiation was given the name alpha rays (and the other two were called beta and gamma rays), these terms being the first three letters of the Greek alphabet.  We still call this form of radiation by the name '''alpha particle''' for historical purposes.  Calling it by this name also contributes to the specific jargon of the field and leads outsiders to think that the subject is quite specialized!

But notice that the radiation really consists of a helium-4 nucleus emitted from an unstable larger nucleus.  There is nothing strange about helium since it is quite an abundant element on our planet.  So why is this radiation dangerous to humans?  The answer to this question lies with the energy with which they are emitted and the fact that they are quite massive and have a double positive charge.  So when they interact with living matter they can cause substantial destruction to molecules which they encounter in their attempt to slow down and to attract two electrons to become a neutral helium atom.

An example of this form of decay occurs in the [[W:Uranium_238|uranium-238]] nucleus.  The equation which represents what occurs is:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{92}}^{\mathbf{238}}\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{90}}^{\mathbf{234}}\mathbf{Th}&lt;/math&gt;
 + &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{2}}^{\mathbf{4}}\mathbf{He}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here the uranium-238 nucleus emits a helium-4 nucleus (the alpha particle) and the parent nucleus becomes thorium-234.  Note that the Mass Number of the parent nucleus has been reduced by 4 and the Atomic Number is reduced by 2 which is a characteristic of alpha decay for any nucleus in which it occurs.

== Beta Decay ==

There are three common forms of [[W:Beta-decay|beta decay]]:

'''(a)	Electron Emission'''
	
:Certain nuclei which have an excess of neutrons may attempt to reach stability by converting a neutron into a proton with the emission of an electron.  The electron is called a '''beta-minus particle''' - the minus indicating that the particle is negatively charged.

:We can represent what occurs as follows:

&lt;center&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; → p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:where a neutron converts into a proton and an electron.  Notice that the total electrical charge is the same on both sides of this equation.  We say that the [[W:Charge_Conservation|electric charge is conserved]].

:We can consider that the electron cannot exist inside the nucleus and therefore is ejected.  

:Once again there is nothing strange or mysterious about an electron.  What is important though from a radiation safety point of view is the energy with which it is emitted and the chemical damage it can cause when it interacts with living matter.

:An example of this type of decay occurs in the [[W:I_131|iodine-131]] nucleus which decays into xenon-131 with the emission of an electron, that is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{53}}^{\mathbf{131}}\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt;
 → &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{54}}^{\mathbf{131}}\mathbf{Xe}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{-1}}^{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:The electron is what is called a beta-minus particle.  Note that the Mass Number in the above equation remains the same and that the Atomic Number increases by 1 which is characteristic of this type of decay.

:You may be wondering how an electron can be produced inside a nucleus given that the simple atomic description we gave in the previous chapter indicated that the nucleus consists of protons and neutrons only.  This is one of the limitations of the simple treatment presented so far and can be explained by considering that the two particles which we call protons and neutrons are themselves formed of smaller particles called '''quarks'''.  We are not going to consider these in any way here other than to note that some combinations of different types of [[W:Quark|quark]] produce protons and another combination produces neutrons.  The message here is to appreciate that a simple picture is the best way to start in an introductory text such as this and that the real situation is a lot more complex than what has been described.  The same can be said about the treatment of beta-decay given above as we will see in subsequent chapters.

'''(b)	Positron Emission'''

:When the number of protons in a nucleus is too large for the nucleus to be stable it may attempt to reach stability by converting a proton into a neutron with the emission of a positively-charged electron.  

:That is not a typographical error!  An electron with a positive charge also called a '''positron''' is emitted. The positron is the '''beta-plus particle'''.

:The history here is quite interesting.  A brilliant Italian physicist, [[W:Enrico_Fermi|Enrico Fermi]] developed a theory of beta decay and his theory predicted that positively-charged as well as negatively-charged electrons could be emitted by unstable nuclei.  These particles could be called pieces of [[W:Anti-matter|anti-matter]] and they were subsequently discovered by experiment.  They do not exist for very long as they quickly combine with a normal electron and the subsequent reaction called '''annihilation''' gives rise to the emission of two gamma rays.

:Science fiction writers had a great time following the discovery of anti-matter and speculated along with many scientists that parts of our universe may contain negatively-charged protons forming nuclei which are orbited by positively-charged electrons.  But this is taking us too far away from the topic at hand!

:The reaction in our unstable nucleus which contains one too many protons can be represented as follows:

&lt;center&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Notice, once again, that electric charge is conserved on each side of this equation.

:An example of this type of decay occurs in [[W:Sodium|sodium-22]] which decays into neon-22 with the emission of a positron:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{11}}^{\mathbf{22}}\mathbf{Na}&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{10}}^{\mathbf{22}}\mathbf{Ne}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{+1}}^{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Note that the Mass Number remains the same and that the Atomic Number decreases by 1.

'''(c)	Electron Capture'''

:In this third form of beta decay an inner orbiting electron is attracted into an unstable nucleus where it combines with a proton to form a neutron.  The reaction can be represented as:

&lt;center&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:This process is also known as '''K-capture''' since the electron is often attracted from the K-shell of the atom.

:How do we know that a process like this occurs given that no radiation is emitted?  In other words the event occurs within the atom itself and no information about it leaves the atom.  Or does it?  The signature of this type of decay can be obtained from effects in the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus when the vacant site left in the K-shell is filled by an electron from an outer shell.  The filling of the vacancy is associated with the [[W:K-capture|emission of an X-ray]] from the electron cloud and it is this X-ray which provides a signature for this type of beta decay.

:This form of decay can also be recognised by the emission of gamma-rays from the new nucleus.

:An example of this type of radioactive decay occurs in [[W:Iron|iron-55]] which decays into manganese-55 following the capture of an electron.  The reaction can be represented as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{26}}^{\mathbf{55}}\mathbf{Fe}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{-1}}^{\mathbf{0}}\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{25}}^{\mathbf{55}}\mathbf{Mn}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Note that the Mass Number once again is unchanged in this form of decay and that the Atomic Number is decreased by 1.

== Gamma Decay ==

Gamma decay involves the emission of energy from an unstable nucleus in the form of electromagnetic radiation.  

You should remember from your high school physics that [[W:Electromagnetic_radiation|electromagnetic radiation]] is the biggest physical phenomenon we have so far discovered.  The radiation can be characterised in terms of its frequency, its wavelength and its energy.  Thinking about it in terms of the energy of the radiation we have very low energy electromagnetic radiation called '''radio waves''', '''infra-red radiation''' at a slightly higher energy, '''visible light''' at a higher energy still, then '''ultra-violet radiation''' and the higher energy forms of this radiation are called '''X-rays''' and '''gamma-rays'''.  You should also remember that these radiations form what is called the Electromagnetic Spectrum.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM3_11.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

Before proceeding it is useful to pause for a moment to consider the difference between X-rays and gamma-rays.  These two forms of radiation are high energy electromagnetic rays and are therefore virtually the same.  The difference between them is not '''what''' they consist of but '''where''' they come from.  In general we can say that if the radiation emerges from a nucleus it is called a gamma-ray and if it emerges from outside the nucleus from the electron cloud for example, it is called an X-ray.

One final point is of relevance before we consider the different forms of gamma-decay and that is what such a high energy ray really is.  It has been found in experiments that gamma-rays (and X-rays for that matter!) sometimes manifest themselves as waves and other times as particles.  This [[W:Wave-particle_duality|wave-particle duality]] can be explained using the equivalence of mass and energy at the atomic level.  When we describe a gamma ray as a wave it has been found useful to use terms such as frequency and wavelength just like any other wave.  In addition when we describe a gamma ray as a particle we use terms such as mass and electric charge.  Furthermore the term [[W:Photon|electromagnetic photon]] is used for these particles.  The interesting feature about these photons however is that they have neither mass nor charge!

There are two common forms of gamma decay:

'''(a)	Isomeric Transition'''

:A nucleus in an excited state may reach its ground or unexcited state by the emission of a gamma-ray.

:An example of this type of decay is that of [[W:Technetium|technetium-99m]] - which by the way is the most common radioisotope used for diagnostic purposes today in medicine.  The reaction can be expressed as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{43}}^{\mathbf{99m}}\mathbf{Tc}&lt;/math&gt; → &lt;math&gt;{}_{\mathbf{43}}^{\mathbf{99}}\mathbf{Tc}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Here a nucleus of technetium-99 is in an excited state, that is, it has excess energy.  The excited state in this case is called a '''metastable state''' and the nucleus is therefore called technetium-99m (m for metastable).  The excited nucleus looses its excess energy by emitting a gamma-ray to become technetium-99.

'''(b)	Internal Conversion'''

:Here the excess energy of an excited nucleus is given to an atomic electron, e.g. a K-shell electron.

== Decay Schemes ==

[[W:Decay_scheme|Decay schemes]] are widely used to give a visual representation of radioactive decay.  A scheme for a relatively straight-forward decay is shown below:

[[Image:NM3_12.gif|thumb|150px|]]

This scheme is for hydrogen-3 which decays to helium-3 with a half-life of 12.3 years through the emission of a beta-minus particle with an energy of 0.0057 MeV.

A scheme for a more complicated decay is that of caesium-137.

[[Image:NM3_13.gif|thumb|left|150px|]]

This isotope can decay through through two beta-minus processes.  In one which occurs in 5% of disintegrations a beta-minus particle is emitted with an energy of 1.17 MeV to produce barium-137.  In the second which occurs more frequently (in the remaining 95% of disintegrations) a beta-minus particle of energy 0.51 MeV is emitted to produce barium-137m - in other words a barium-137 nucleus in a metastable state.  The barium-137m then decays via isomeric transition with the emission of a gamma-ray of energy 0.662 MeV.

[[Image:NM3_14.gif|thumb|]]

The general method used for decay schemes is illustrated in the diagram on the right.

The energy is plotted on the vertical axis and atomic number on the horizontal axis - although these axes are rarely displayed in actual schemes.  The isotope from which the scheme originates is displayed at the top - X in the case above.  This isotope is referred to as the '''parent'''.  The parent looses energy when it decays and hence the products of the decay referred to as '''daughters''' are plotted at a lower energy level.

The diagram illustrates the situation for common forms of radioactive decay.  Alpha-decay is illustrated on the left where the mass number is reduced by 4 and the atomic number is reduced by 2 to produce daughter '''A'''.  To its right the scheme for beta-plus decay is shown to produce daughter '''B'''.  The situation for beta-minus decay followed by gamma-decay is shown on the right side of the diagram where daughters '''C''' and '''D''' respectively are produced.

The enegy, frequency and wavelength of the radiation which makes up the Electromagnetic Spectrum. The X- and gamma-ray window has been used for diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications for over one hundred years. The NMR window has more recently found application in medicine and uses radio waves in an imaging technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).  Generated by Kieran Maher using Aldus SuperPaint.

The color corresponds to the value of the half-life T½ with a strong log scale, since it varies between 10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; seconds.]]

We covered radioactive decay from a phenomenological perspective in the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Radioactive_Decay|last chapter]].  In this chapter we consider the topic from a more general analytical perspective.

The reason for doing this is so that we can develop a form of thinking which will help us to understand what is going on in a quantitative, mathematical sense.  We will be introduced to concepts such as the '''Decay Constant''' and the '''Half Life''' as well as units used for the measurement of radioactivity.  You will also have a chance to develop your understanding by being brought through three questions on this subject.

== Assumptions ==

The usual starting point in most forms of analysis in physics is to make some assumptions which simplify the situation.  By simplifying the situation we can dispose of irrelevant effects which tend to complicate matters but in doing so we sometimes make the situation so simple that it becomes a bit too abstract and apparently hard to understand.  

For this reason we will try here to relate the subject of radioactive decay to a more common situation which we will use as an analogy and hopefully we will be able to overcome the abstract feature of the subject matter.  The analogy we will use here is that of making [[W:Popcorn|popcorn]].

So think about putting some oil in a pot, adding the corn, heating the pot on the cooker and watching what happens.  You might also like to try this out while considering the situation!

For our radioactive decay situation we first of all consider that we have a sample containing a large number of radioactive nuclei all of the same kind.  This is our unpopped corn in the pot for example.

Secondly we assume that all of the radioactive nuclei decay by the same process be it alpha, beta or gamma-decay.  In other words our unpopped corn goes pop at some stage during the heating process.

Thirdly take a few moments to ponder on the fact that we can only really consider what is going on from a statistical perspective.  If you look at an individual piece of corn, can you figure out when it is going to pop?  Not really. You can however figure out that a large number of them will have popped after a period of time.  But its rather more difficult to figure out the situation for an individual piece of corn.  So instead of dealing with individual entities we consider what happens on a larger scale and this is where [[W:Statistics|statistics]] comes in.  We can say that the radioactive decay is a statistical one-shot process, that is when a nucleus has decayed it cannot repeat the process again.  In other words when a piece of corn has popped it cannot repeat the process.  Simple!

In addition as long as a radioactive nucleus has not decayed the probability for it doing so in the next moment remains the same.  In other words if a piece of corn has not popped at a certain time the chance of it popping in the next second is the same as in the previous second.  The bets are even!

Let us not push this popcorn analogy too far though in that we know that we can control the rate of popping by the heat we apply to the pot for example.  However as far as our radioactive nuclei are concerned there is nothing we can do to control what is going on.  The rate at which nuclei go pop (or '''decay''', in other words) cannot be influenced by heating up the sample.  Nor by cooling it for that matter or by putting it under greater pressures, by changing the gravitational environment by taking it out into space for instance, or by changing any other aspect of its physical environment.  The only thing that determines whether an individual nucleus will decay seems to be the nucleus itself.  But on the average we can say that it will decay at some stage.

== The Radioactive Decay Law ==

Let us now use some symbols to reduce the amount of writing we have to do to describe what is going on and to avail ourselves of some mathematical techniques to simplify the situation even further than we have been able to do so far.

Let us say that in the sample of radioactive material there are N nuclei which have not decayed at a certain time, t.  So what happens in the next brief period of time?  Some nuclei will decay for sure.  But how many?  

On the basis of our reasoning above we can say that the number which will decay will depend on overall number of nuclei, N, and also on the length of the brief period of time.  In other words the more nuclei there are the more will decay and the longer the time period the more nuclei will decay.  Let us denote the number which will have decayed as '''dN''' and the small time interval as '''dt'''.

So we have reasoned that the number of radioactive nuclei which will decay during the time interval from t to t+dt must be proportional to N and to dt.  In symbols therefore:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-dN \propto N \cdot dt\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

the minus sign indicating that N is decreasing.

Turning the proportionality in this equation into an equality we can write:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-dN = \lambda N \cdot dt\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where the constant of proportionality, &amp;lambda;, is called the '''Decay Constant'''.

Dividing across by N we can rewrite this equation as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\frac{dN}{N} = \lambda \cdot dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So this equation describes the situation for any brief time interval, dt.  To find out what happens for all periods of time we simply add up what happens in each brief time interval.  In other words we [[W:Integral|integrate]] the above equation.  Expressing this more formally we can say that for the period of time from t = 0 to any later time t, the number of radioactive nuclei will decrease from N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, so that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\int_{N_0}^{N_t} \frac{dN}{N} = \lambda \int_{0}^t dt&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \ln \left ( \frac{N_t}{N_0} \right ) = -\lambda t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \frac{N_t}{N_0} = \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore N_t = N_0 \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This final expression is known as the '''Radioactive Decay Law'''.  It tells us that the number of radioactive nuclei will decrease in an exponential fashion with time with the rate of decrease being controlled by the [[W:Exponential_decay|Decay Constant]].

Before looking at this expression in further detail let us review the mathematics which we used above.  First of all we used integral calculus to figure out what was happening over a period of time by integrating what we knew would occur in a brief interval of time.  Secondly we used a calculus relationship that the

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dx}{x} = \ln x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where ln ''x'' represents the [[A-level_Mathematics/C3/Special_Functions_and_Transformations#The_Natural_Logarithm|natural logarithm]] of ''x''.  And thirdly we used the definition of logarithms that when

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ln x = y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

then,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = \text{exp}\ y\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Now, to return to the Radioactive Decay Law.  The Law tells us that the number of radioactive nuclei will decrease with time in an exponential fashion with the rate of decrease being controlled by the Decay Constant.  The Law is shown in graphical form in the figure below:

[[Image:NM4_11a.gif|center|thumb]]

The graph plots the number of radioactive nuclei at any time, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, against time, ''t''.  We can see that the number of radioactive nuclei decreases from ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that is the number at ''t'' = 0 in a rapid fashion initially and then more slowly in the classic exponential manner.

The influence of the Decay Constant can be seen in the following figure:

[[Image:NM4_12a.gif|center|thumb]]

All three curves here are exponential in nature, only the Decay Constant is different.  Notice that when the Decay Constant has a low value the curve decreases relatively slowly and when the Decay Constant is large the curve decreases very quickly.

The Decay Constant is characteristic of individual radionuclides.  Some like uranium-238 have a small value and the material therefore decays quite slowly over a long period of time.  Other nuclei such as technetium-99m have a relatively large Decay Constant and they decay far more quickly.

It is also possible to consider the Radioactive Decay Law from another perspective by plotting the logarithm of N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; against time.  In other words from our analysis above by plotting the expression:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ln \left ( \frac{N_t}{N_0} \right ) = - \lambda t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

in the form

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\ln N_t = -\lambda t + \ln N_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that this expression is simply an equation of the form ''y'' = ''mx'' + ''c'' where ''m'' = -l and ''c'' = ln ''N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  As a result it is the equation of a straight line of slope -l as shown in the following figure.  Such a plot is sometimes useful when we wish to consider a situation without the complication of the direct exponential behaviour.

[[Image:NM4_15a.gif|center|thumb]]

== Half-Life ==

Most of us have not been taught to think instinctively in terms of logarithmic or exponential terms even though many natural phenomena display exponential behaviours.  Most of the forms of thinking which we have been taught in school are based on linear changes and as a result it is rather difficult for us to grasp the Radioactive Decay Law intuitively.  For this reason an indicator is usually derived from the law which helps us think more clearly about what is going on.

This indicator is called the '''Half Life''' and it expresses the length of time it takes for the radioactivity of a radioisotope to decrease by a factor of two.  From a graphical point of view we can say that when:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N_t = \frac{N_0}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

the time taken is the Half Life:

[[Image:NM4_18a.gif|center|thumb]]

Note that the [[W:Half-life|half-life]] does not express how long a material will remain radioactive but simply the length of time for its radioactivity to halve.  Examples of the half lives of some radioisotopes are given in the following table.  Notice that some of these have a relatively short half life.  These tend to be the ones used for medical diagnostic purposes because they do not remain radioactive for very long following administration to a patient and hence result in a relatively low radiation dose.

But they do present a logistical problem when we wish to use them when there may not be a radioisotope production facility nearby.  For example suppose we wish to use &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc for a patient study and the nearest nuclear facility for making this isotope is 5,000 km away.   The production facility could be in Sydney and the patient could be in Perth for instance.  After making the isotope at the nuclear plant it would be decaying with a half life of 6 hours.  So we put the material on a truck and drive it to Sydney airport.  The isotope would be decaying as the truck sits in Sydney traffic then decaying still more as it waits for a plane to take it to Perth.  Then decaying more as it is flown across to Perth and so on.  By the time it gets to our patient it will have substantially reduced in radioactivity possibly to the point of being useless for the patient's investigation.  And what about the problem if we needed to use &lt;sup&gt;81m&lt;/sup&gt;Kr instead of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc for our patient?  You will see in  [[../Production_of_Radioisotopes|another chapter]] of this book that logistical challenges such as this have given rise to quite innovative solutions.  More about that later!

You can appreciate from the table above that other isotopes have a very long half lives.  For example &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra has a half life of over 1,500 years.  This isotope has been used in the past for therapeutic applications in medicine.  Think about the logistical problems here.  They obviously do not relate to transporting the material from the point of production to the point of use.  But they relate to how the material is kept following its arrival at the point of use.  We must have a storage facility so that the material can be kept safely for a long period of time.  But for how long?  A general rule of thumb for the quantities of radioactivity used in medicine is that the radioactivity will remain significant for about 10 half lives.  So we would have to have a safe environment for storage of the &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra for about 16,000 years!  This storage facility would have to be secure from many unforeseeable events such as earthquakes, bombing etc. and be kept in a manner which our children's, children's children can understand.  A very serious undertaking indeed!

== Relationship between the Decay Constant and the Half Life ==

On the basis of the above you should be able to appreciate that there is a relationship between the Decay Constant and the Half Life.  For example when the Decay Constant is small the Half Life should be long and correspondingly when the Decay Constant is large the Half Life should be short.  But what exactly is the nature of this relationship?

We can easily answer this question by using the definition of Half Life and applying it to the Radioactive Decay Law.

Once again the law tells us that at any time, ''t'':

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N_t = N_0\ \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and the definition of Half Life tells us that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N_t = \frac{N_0}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

when

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;t = t_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

We can therefore re-write the Radioactive Decay Law by substituting for ''N''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t'' as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_0}{2} = N_0\ \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore 2^{-1} = \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \ln 2^{-1} = -\lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \ln 2 = \lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore 0.693 = \lambda t_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;t_{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{0.693}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{0.693}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

These last two equations express the relationship between the Decay Constant and the Half Life.  They are very useful as you will see when solving numerical questions relating to radioactivity and usually form the first step in solving a numerical problem.

== Units of Radioactivity ==

The SI or metric unit of radioactivity is named after Henri Becquerel, in honour of his discovery of radioactivity, and is called the '''becquerel''' with the symbol Bq.  The [[W:Becquerel|becquerel]] is defined as the quantity of radioactive substance that gives rise to a decay rate of 1 decay per second.

In medical diagnostic work 1 Bq is a rather small amount of radioactivity.  Indeed it is easy to remember its definition if you think of it as a ''buggerall'' amount of radioactivity.  For this reason the kilobecquerel (kBq) and megabecquerel (MBq) are more frequently used.

The traditional unit of radioactivity is named after Marie Curie and is called the '''curie''', with the symbol Ci.  The [[W:Curie|curie]] is defined as the amount of radioactive substance which gives rise to a decay rate of 3.7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; decays per second.  In other words 37 thousand, million decays per second which as you might appreciate is a substantial amount of radioactivity.  For medical diagnostic work the millicurie (mCi) and the microcurie (µCi) are therefore more frequently used.

Why two units?  It in essence like all other units of measurement depends on what part of the world you are in.  For example the kilometer is widely used in Europe and Australia as a unit of distance and the mile is used in the USA.  So if you are reading an American textbook you are likely to find the curie used as the unit of radioactivity, if you are reading an Australian book it will most likely refer to becquerels and both units might be used if you are reading a European book.  You will therefore find it necessary to know and understand both units.

== Multiple Choice Questions ==

Click [[Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine/The Radioactive Decay Law MCQ|&lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;]] to access an MCQ on the Radioactive Decay Law.

== Questions ==

Three questions are given below to help you develop your understanding of the material presented in this chapter.  The first one is relatively straight-forward and will exercise your application of the Radioactive Decay Law as well as your understanding of the concept of Half Life.  The second question is a lot more challenging and will help you relate the Radioactive Decay Law to the number of radioactive nuclei which are decaying in a sample of radioactive material.  The third question will help you understand the approach used in the second question by asking a similar question from a slightly different perspective.

'''Question 1'''

(a)	The half-life of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is 6 hours.  After how much time will 1/16th of the radioisotope remain?

(b)	Verify your answer by another means.

'''Answer''':

:(a)	Starting with the relationship we established earlier between the Decay Constant and the Half Life we can calculate the Decay Constant as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{0.693}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{0.693}{6} = 0.1155\ \text{hr}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Now applying the Radioactive Decay Law,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N_t = N_0\ \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:we can re-write it in the form:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_t}{N_0} = \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:The question tells us that N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; has reduced to 1/16th of its value, that is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_t}{N_0} = \frac{1}{16}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Therefore

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{16} = \text{exp}\,(-0.1155t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:which we need to solve for t.  One way of doing this is as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;16^{-1} = \text{exp}\,(-0.1155t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore -\ln 16 = -0.1155t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\ln 16}{0.1155} = 24\ \text{hours}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:So it will take 24 hours until 1/16th of the radioactivity remains.

:(b)	A way in which this answer can be verified is by using the definition of Half Life.  We are told that the Half Life of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is 6 hours.  Therefore after six hours half of the radioactivity remains.

:Therefore after 12 hours a quarter remains; after 18 hours an eighth remains and after 24 hours one sixteenth remains.  And we arrive at the same answer as in part (a).  So we must be right!

:Note that this second approach is useful if we are dealing with relatively simple situations where the radioactivity is halved, quartered and so on.  But supposing the question asked how long would it take for the radioactivity to decrease to a tenth of its initial value.  Deduction from the definition of half life is rather more difficult in this case and the mathematical approach used for part (a) above will yield the answer more readily.

'''Question 2'''

Find the radioactivity of a 1 g sample of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra given that ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;: 1620 years and Avogadro's Number: 6.023 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Answer''':

:We can start the answer like we did with Question 1(a) by calculating the Decay Constant from the Half Life using the following equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{0.693}{t_{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{0.693}{1620} = 4.28 \cdot 10^{-4}\ \text{year}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \lambda = 1.36 \cdot 10^{-11} s^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Note that the length of a year used in converting from 'per year' to 'per second' above is 365.25 days to account for leap years.  In addition the reason for converting to units of 'per second' is because the unit of radioactivity is expressed as the number of nuclei decaying per second.

:Secondly we can calculate that 1 g of &lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra contains:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N = \frac{(\text{Avogadro No.})(\text{Mass})}{\text{Mass Number}} = \frac{(6.023 \cdot 10^{23})(1g)}{226} = 2.7 \cdot 10^{21}\ \text{nuclei}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Thirdly we need to express the Radioactive Decay Law in terms of the number of nuclei decaying per unit time.  We can do this by [[W:Derivative|differentiating]] the equation as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;N = N_0\ \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \frac{dN}{dt} = N_0 \cdot -\lambda\ \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t) = -\lambda N_0\ \text{exp}\,(-\lambda t)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \left | \frac{dN}{dt} \right | = \lambda N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:The reason for expressing the result above in absolute terms is to remove the minus sign in that we already know that the number is decreasing.

:We can now enter the data we derived above for &amp;lambda; and ''N'':

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left | \frac{dN}{dt} \right | = (1.36 \cdot 10^{-11})(2.7 \cdot 10^{21})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \left | \frac{dN}{dt} \right | = 3.6 \cdot 10^{10}\ \text{decays per second}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:So the radioactivity of our 1 g sample of radium-226 is approximately 1 Ci.

:This is not a surprising answer since the definition of the '''curie''' was originally conceived as the radioactivity of 1 g of radium-226!


'''Question 3'''

What is the minimum mass of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc that can have a radioactivity of 1 MBq?  Assume the half-life is 6 hours and that Avogadro's Number is 6.023 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Answer'''

:Starting again with the relationship between the Decay Constant and the Half Life:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{0.693}{6} = 0.1155\ \text{hour}^{-1} = 3.21 \cdot 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Secondly the question tells us that the radioactivity is 1 MBq.  Therefore since 1 MBq = 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; decays per second,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left | \frac{dN}{dt} \right | = \lambda N = 1 \cdot 10^6\ \text{dps}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore N = \frac{\left | \frac{dN}{dt} \right |}{\lambda} = \frac{1 \cdot 10^6}{3.21 \cdot 10^{-5}} = 3.116 \cdot 10^{10}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Finally the mass of these nuclei can be calculated as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\text{Mass of N nuclei} = \frac{(\text{No. of Nuclei})(\text{Mass No.})}{\text{Avogadro Number}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \frac{(3.116 \cdot 10^{10})(99)}{6.023 \cdot 10^{23}} = 5.122 \cdot 10^{-12}\ \text{g}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:In other words a mass of just over five picograms of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc can emit one million gamma-rays per second.  The result reinforces an important point that you will learn about radiation protection which is that you should treat radioactive materials just like you would handle pathogenic bacteria!

== Introduction ==

This is the fourth chapter of a wikibook entitled [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine|Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine]].

After that rather long and detailed chapter we have just finished we will now proceed at a more leisurely pace for a short treatment of some of the more common units of measurement used in this field.  

Before we do so however it is useful to consider the typical radiation environment.  By doing so we will gain an appreciation of the various quantities that can be measured before considering the units which are used to express such measurements.  So, we will first of all consider a typical radiation situation and then go on to consider the various units of measurement.


== A Typical Radiation Situation ==


A typical radiation set-up is shown in the figure below.  Firstly there is a '''source''' of radiation, secondly a radiation '''beam''' and thirdly some '''material''' which absorbs the radiation.  So the quantities which can be measured are associated with the source, the radiation beam and the absorber.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM5_1.gif]]&lt;/center&gt;

This type of environment could be one where the radiation from the source is used to irradiate a patient (that is the absorber) for diagnostic purposes where we would place a device behind the patient for producing an image or for therapeutic purposes where the radiation is intended to cause damage to a specific region of a patient.  It is also a situation where we as an absorber may be working with a source of radiation.

== The Radiation Source ==


When the radiation source is a radioactive one the quantity that is typically measured is the radioactivity of the source.  We saw in the previous chapter that the units used to express radioactivity are the '''becquerel''' (SI unit) and the '''curie''' (traditional unit).



== The Radiation Beam ==


The characteristic of a radiation beam that is typically measured is called the '''Radiation Exposure'''.  This quantity expresses how much ionisation the beam causes in the air through which it travels.

We will see in the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter|following chapter]] that one of the major things that happens when radiation encounters matter is that [[W:Ion|ions]] are formed - air being the form of matter it encounters in this case.  So the radiation exposure produced by a radiation beam is expressed in terms of the amount of ionisation which occurs in air.  

A straight-forward way of measuring such ionisation is to determine the amount of electric charge which is produced.  You will remember from your high school physics that the SI unit of electric charge is the '''coulomb'''.

The SI unit of radiation exposure is the '''coulomb per kilogram''' - and is given the symbol C kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is defined as the quantity of X- or gamma-rays such that the associated electrons emitted per kilogram of air at standard temperature and pressure (STP) produce ions carrying 1 coulomb of electric charge.

The traditional unit of radiation exposure is the '''roentgen''', named in honour of [[W:Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen|Wilhelm Roentgen]] (who discovered X-rays) and is given the symbol R.  The [[W:Roentgen|roentgen]] is defined as the quantity of X- or gamma-rays such that the associated  electrons emitted per kilogram of air at STP produce ions carrying 2.58 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; coulombs of electric charge.

So 1 R is a small exposure relative to 1 C kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; - in fact it is 3,876 times smaller.

Note that this unit is confined to radiation beams consisting of X-rays or gamma-rays.

Often it is not simply the exposure that is of interest but the exposure rate, that is the exposure per unit time.  The units which tend to be used in this case are the C kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and the R hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== The Absorber ==


Energy is deposited in the absorber when radiation interacts with it.  It is usually quite a small amount of energy but energy nonetheless.  The quantity that is measured is called the '''Absorbed Dose''' and it is of relevance to all types of radiation be they X- or gamma-rays, alpha- or beta-particles.

The SI unit of absorbed dose is called the '''gray''', named after a famous radiobiologist, [[W:Louis_Harold_Gray|LH Gray]], and is given the symbol Gy.  The [[W:Gray_%28unit%29|gray]] is defined as the absorption of 1 joule of radiation energy per kilogram of material.  So when 1 joule of radiation energy is absorbed by a kilogram of the absorber material we say that the absorbed dose is 1 Gy.

The traditional unit of absorbed dose is called the '''rad''', which supposedly stands for [[W:Rad_%28unit%29|Radiation Absorbed Dose]].  It is defined as the absorption of 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; joules of radiation energy per kilogram of material.

As you can figure out 1 Gy is equal to 100 rad.

There are other quantities derived from the gray and the rad which express the biological effects of such absorbed radiation energy when the absorber is living matter - human tissue for example.  These quantities include the [[W:Equivalent_dose|Equivalent Dose]], &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;H&lt;/font&gt;, and the [[W:Effective_dose|Effective Dose]], &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;E&lt;/font&gt;.  The Equivalent Dose is based on estimates of the ionization capability of the different types of radiation which are called '''Radiation Weighting Factors''', &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, such that

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;H = w&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;D&lt;/font&gt; is the absorbed dose. The Effective Dose includes &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt; as well as estimates of the sensitivity of different tissues called '''Tissue Weighting Factors''', &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;w&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;, such that

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;E = Σ w&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; H&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where the summation, &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Σ&lt;/font&gt;, is over all the tissue types involved.  Both the Equivalent Dose and the Effective Dose are measured in derived SI units called [[W:Sievert|sieverts]] (Sv).

Let us pause here for a bit to ponder on the use of the term ''dose''.  It usually has a medical connotation in that we can say that someone had a dose of the 'flu, or that the doctor prescribed a certain dose of a drug.  What has it to do with the deposition of energy by a beam of radiation in an absorber?  It could have something to do with the initial applications of radiation in the early part of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century when it was used to treat numerous diseases.  As a result we can speculate that the term has stayed in the vernacular of the field.  It would be much easier to use a term like absorbed radiation energy since we are talking about the deposition of energy in an absorber.  But this might make the subject just a little too simple!

== Specific Gamma Ray Constant ==


A final quantity is worth mentioning with regard to radiation units.  This is the Specific Gamma-Ray Constant for a radioisotope.  This quantity is an amalgam of the quantities we have already covered and expresses the exposure rate produced by the gamma-rays emitted from a radioisotope.

It is quite a useful quantity from a practical viewpoint when we are dealing with a radioactive source which emits gamma-rays.  Supposing you are using a gamma-emitting radioactive source (for example &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc or &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs) and you will be standing at a certain distance from this source while you are working.  You most likely will be interested in the exposure rate produced by the source from a radiation safety point of view.  This is where the Specific Gamma-Ray Constant comes in.

It is defined as the exposure rate per unit activity at a certain distance from a source.  The SI unit is therefore the

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;C kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; Bq&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;    at    1 m  &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

and the traditional unit is the 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;R hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mCi&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;    at    1 cm &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt; .&lt;/center&gt;

These units of measurement are quite cumbersome and a bit of a mouthful.  It might have been better if they were named after some famous scientist so that we could call the SI unit 1 '''smith''' and the traditional unit 1 '''jones''' for example.  But again things are not that simple!

== The Inverse Square Law ==


Before we finish this chapter we are going to consider what happens as we move our absorber away from the radiation source.  In other words we are going to think about the influence of distance on the intensity of the radiation beam.  You will find that a useful result emerges from this that has a very important impact on radiation safety.

The radiation produced in a radioactive source is emitted in all directions.  We can consider that spheres of equal radiation intensity exist around the source with the number of photons/particles spreading out as we move away from the source.  

Consider an area on the surface of one of these spheres and assume that there are a certain number of photons/particles passing though it.  If we now consider a sphere at a greater distance from the source the same number of photons/particles will now be spread out over a bigger area.  Following this line of thought it is easy to appreciate that the radiation intensity, I will decrease with the square of the distance, r from the source, i.e.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This effect is known as the [[W:Inverse_square_law|Inverse Square Law]].  As a result if we double the distance from a source, we reduce the intensity by a factor of two squared, that is 4.  If we triple the distance the intensity is reduced by a factor of 9, that is three squared, and so on.

This is a very useful piece of information if you are working with a source of radiation and are interested in minimising the dose of radiation you will receive.

There is a sentence hidden behind the infobox, that you can see if you change your font size. I use a 130% fontsize, and I can see '..tion' appear on the right of the box in the upper left corner.

== Misleading title ==

The subtitle is wrong: From Joan of Arc to Tony Blair. If you want to make a clear chronological statement here spanning the lifetime of European History from its beginning to its present ('Tony Blair' is associated with the present) then Joan of Arc is wrong in this perspective, since there were many important historical figures before her life time.
I suggest to replace her name with &quot;Charlemagne&quot;, which makes much more sense to me.

As a remark and personal opinion: Tony Blair does not fit into Europe's picture as other politicians would do today, because of his standpoint in questions of the European Union and the special state Great Britain has in Europe (of the big and old nations of Europe Great Britain's people show the least identification with Europe and what it stands for) I would replace his name as well with somebody like the Luxembourg president or Romano Prodi.

:I've removed the subtitle. Mentioning Tony Blair is POV, suggesting he is somehow the most important person in Europe today. I don't see why that would be him.
:I've also changed &quot;complete survey&quot; to just &quot;survey&quot;. I'm not sure what a complete survey is, and I don't think we're ever going to agree on that. [[User:Qwertyus|Qwertyus]] 14:56, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

::I also think the earlier title is misleading because it says &quot;from Rome to present day, yet the next page says &quot;from hundred years war to present&quot;

==pictures in PDF version==

i started reading the book on line and deceded to download the pdf version, and notice there isn't so many pictures as the on line and print-version. why is that?

PS: very good book!!![[User:201.78.130.253|201.78.130.253]] 06:15, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

== Well Done ==

I'm reading the book at the moment and I have honestly ound it to be one of the best books I have read on history for a long time. Well Done to everyony. --[[Special:Contributions/82.33.114.90|82.33.114.90]] ([[User talk:82.33.114.90|talk]]) 08:39, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

== Linking to Wikipedia? ==

How do contributors feel about linking to Wikipedia for some (for lack of a better word) events? For example, I would like to link to the Wikipedia article for &quot;denazification&quot; in the chapter &quot;1918-1945&quot;, as we need not go through it in detail, but it would be nice if we placed links for further reading.

This policy applies to all chapters of this book. I believe it would entice the reader to read on, and being a free culture book, its purpose is nothing but ''informing'' the reader about European History as effectively as possible. Placing links to Wikipedia is a means to this end. What do ''you'' think?

We have focussed in previous chapters on the source of radiation and the types of radiation.  We are now in a position to consider what happens when this radiation interacts with matter.  Our main reason for doing this is to find out what happens to the radiation as it passes through matter and also to set ourselves up for considering how it interacts with living tissue and how to detect radiation.  Since all radiation detectors are made from some form of matter it is useful to first of all know how radiation interacts so that we can exploit the effects in the design of such detectors in subsequent chapters of this wikibook.

Before we do this let us first remind ourselves of the physical characteristics of the major types of radiation.  We have covered this information in some detail [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Radioactive_Decay|earlier]] and it is summarised in the table below for convenience.

We will now consider the passage of each type of radiation through matter with most attention given to gamma-rays because they are the most common type used in nuclear medicine.  One of the main effects that you will notice irrespective of the type of radiation is that ions are produced when radiation interacts with matter.  It is for this reason that it is called [[W:Ionizing_radiation|ionizing radiation]].

Before we start though you might find an analogy useful to help you with your thinking.  This analogy works on the basis of thinking about matter as an enormous mass of atoms (that is nuclei with orbiting electrons) and that the radiation is a particle/photon passing through this type of environment.  So the analogy to think about is a spaceship passing through a meteor storm like you might see in a science-fiction movie where the spaceship represents the radiation and the meteors represent the atoms of the material through which the radiation is passing.  One added feature to bring on board however is that our spaceship sometimes has an electric charge depending on the type of radiation it represents.

== Alpha Particles ==


We can see from the table above that [[W:Alpha_particles|alpha-particles]] have a double positive charge and we can therefore easily appreciate that they will exert considerable electrostatic attraction on the outer orbital electrons of atoms near which they pass.  The result is that some electrons will be attracted away from their parent atoms and that ions will be produced.  In other words ionizations occur.

We can also appreciate from the table that alpha-particles are quite massive relative to the other types of radiation and also to the electrons of atoms of the material through which they are passing.  As a result they travel in straight lines through matter except for rare direct collisions with nuclei of atoms along their path.

A third feature of relevance here is the energy with which they are emitted.  This energy in the case of alpha-particles is always distinct.  For example &lt;sup&gt;221&lt;/sup&gt;Ra emits an alpha-particle with an energy of 6.71 MeV.  Every alpha-particle emitted from this radionuclide has this energy.  Another example is &lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;U which emits three alpha-particles with energies of 5.66, 5.82, 5.89 MeV.

Finally it is useful to note that alpha-particles are very damaging biologically and this is one reason why they are not used for in-vivo diagnostic studies.  We will therefore not be considering them in any great detail in this wikibook.

== Beta Particles ==


We can see from the table  that [[W:Beta_particle|beta-particles]] have a negative electric charge.  Notice that positrons are not considered here since as we noted in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Radioactive_Decay|chapter 2]] these particles do not last for very long in matter before they are annihilated.  Beta-minus particles last considerably longer and are therefore the focus of our attention here.

Because of their negative charge they are attracted by nuclei and repelled by electron clouds as they pass through matter.  The result once again without going into great detail is ionization.

The path of beta-particles in matter is often described as being tortuous, since they tend to ricochet from atom to atom.

A final and important point to note is that the energy of beta-particles is never found to be distinct in contrast to the alpha-particles above.  The energies of the beta-particles from a radioactive source forms a spectrum up to a maximum energy - see figure below.  Notice from the figure that a range of energies is present and features such as the mean energy, E&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt;, or the maximum energy, E&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, are quoted.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM6_1.gif|280px]]&lt;/center&gt;


The question we will consider here is: why should a spectrum of energies be seen?  Surely if a beta-particle is produced inside a nucleus when a neutron is converted into a proton, a single distinct energy should result.  The answer lies in the fact that two particles are actually produced in beta-decay.  We did not cover this in our treatment in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Radioactive_Decay|chapter 2]] for fear of complicating things too much at that stage of this wikibook.  But we will cover it here briefly for the sake of completeness.

The second particle produced in beta-decay is called a [[W:Neutrino|neutrino]] and was named by [[W:Enrico_Fermi|Enrico Fermi]].  It is quite a mysterious particle possessing virtually no mass and carrying no charge, though we are still researching its properties today.  The difficulty with them is that they are very hard to detect and this has greatly limited our knowledge about them so far.

The beta-particle energy spectrum can be explained by considering that the energy produced when a neutron is converted to a proton is shared between the beta-particle and the anti-neutrino.  Sometimes all the energy is given to the beta-particle and it receives the maximum energy, E&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  But more often the energy is shared between them so that for example the beta-particle has the mean energy, E&lt;sub&gt;mean&lt;/sub&gt; and the neutrino has the remainder of the energy.

Finally it is useful to note that beta-particles are quite damaging biologically and this is one reason why they are not used for in-vivo diagnostic studies.  We will therefore not consider them in any great detail in this wikibook.

== Gamma Rays ==


Since we have been talking about energies above, let us first note that the energies of [[W:Gamma_ray|gamma-rays]] emitted from a radioactive source are always distinct.  For example &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc emits gamma-rays which all have an energy of 140 keV and &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;Cr emits gamma-rays which have an energy of 320 keV.

Gamma-rays have many modes of interaction with matter.  Those which have little or no relevance to nuclear medicine imaging are:

::* [[W:Mossbauer_effect|Mössbauer Effect]]
::* [[W:Coherent_Scattering|Coherent Scattering]]
::* [[W:Pair_production|Pair Production]]

and will not be described here.

Those which are very important to nuclear medicine imaging, are the [[W:Photoelectric_effect|Photoelectric Effect]] and the [[W:Compton_scattering|Compton Effect]].  We will consider each of these in turn below.  Note that the effects described here are also of relevance to the interaction of X-rays with matter since as we have noted before X-rays and gamma-rays are essentially the same entities.  So the treatment below is also of relevance to radiography.

==== Photoelectric Effect ====

:When a gamma-ray collides with an orbital electron of an atom of the material through which it is passing it can transfer all its energy to the electron and cease to exist - see figure below.  On the basis of the [[W:Conservation_of_energy|Principle of Conservation of Energy]] we can deduce that the electron will leave the atom with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the gamma-ray less that of the orbital binding energy.  This electron is called a '''photoelectron'''.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM6_2.gif|320px]]&lt;/center&gt;

:Note that an ion results when the photoelectron leaves the atom.  Also note that the gamma-ray energy is totally absorbed in the process.

:Two subsequent points should also be noted.  Firstly the photoelectron can cause ionisations along its track in a similar manner to a beta-particle.  Secondly [[W:X-ray_fluorescence|X-ray emission]] can occur when the vacancy left by the photoelectron is filled by an electron from an outer shell of the atom.  Remember that we came across this type of feature before when we dealt with Electron Capture in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Radioactive_Decay|chapter 2]].

==== Compton Effect ====

:This type of effect is somewhat akin to a cue ball hitting a coloured ball on a pool table.  Here a gamma-ray transfers only part of its energy to a valance electron which is essentially free - see figure below.  Notice that the electron leaves the atom and may act like a beta-particle and that the gamma-ray deflects off in a different direction to that with which it approached the atom.  This deflected or scattered gamma-ray can undergo further Compton Effects within the material.  

:Note that this effect is sometimes called '''Compton Scattering'''.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM6_3.gif|320px]]&lt;/center&gt;

The two effects we have just described give rise to both absorption and scattering of the radiation beam.  The overall effect is referred to as '''attenuation''' of gamma-rays.  We will investigate this feature from an analytical perspective in the following chapter.  Before we do so, we'll briefly consider the interaction of radiation with living matter.

== Radiation Biology ==

It is well known that exposure to ionizing radiation can result in damage to living tissue.  We've already described the initial atomic interactions. What's important in radiation biology is that these interactions may trigger complex chains of biomolecular events and consequent biological damage.

We've seen above that the primary means by which ionizing radiations lose their energy in matter is by ejection of orbital electrons.  The loss of orbital electrons from the atom leaves it positively charged.  Other interaction processes lead to '''excitation''' of the atom rather than ionization.  Here, an outer valence electron receives sufficient energy to overcome the binding energy of its shell and moves further away from the nucleus to an orbit that is not normally occupied. This type of effect alters the chemical force that binds atoms into molecules and a regrouping of the affected atoms into different molecular structures can result.  That is, excitation is an indirect method of inducing chemical change through the modification of individual atomic bonds.

Ionizations and excitations can give rise to unstable chemical species called [[W:Free_radical|free radicals]].  These are atoms and molecules in which there are unpaired electrons. They are chemically very reactive and seek stability by bonding with other atoms and molecules.  Changes to nearby molecules can arise because of their production.

But, let's go back to the interactions themselves for the moment.....

In the case of X- and gamma-ray interactions, the energy of the photons is usually transferred by collisions with orbital electrons, e.g. via photoelectric and Compton effects. These radiations are capable of penetrating deeply into tissue since their interactions depend on chance collisions with electrons. Indeed, nuclear medicine imaging is only possible when the energy of the gamma-rays is sufficient for complete emission from the body, but low enough to be detected.

The interaction of charged particles (e.g. alpha and beta particles), on the other hand, can be by collisions with atomic electrons and also via attractive and repulsive electrostatic forces.  The rate at which energy is lost along the track of a charged particle depends therefore on the [[W:Coulomb%27s_law|square of the charge]] on that particle.  That is, the greater the particle charge, the greater the probability of it generating ion pairs along its track. In addition, a longer period of time is available for electrostatic forces to act when a charged particle is moving slowly and the ionization probability is therefore increased as a result.

The situation is illustrated in the following figure where tracks of charged particles in water are depicted.  Notice that the track of the relatively massive α-particle is a straight line, as we've discussed [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter#Alpha_Particles|earlier in this chapter]], with a large number of interactions (indicated by the asterisks) per unit length. Notice also that the tracks for electrons are tortuous, as we've also discussed [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter#Beta_Particles|earlier]], and that the number of interactions per unit length is considerably less.

[[Image:NM6_11.gif|thumb|320px|center|Ionizations and excitations along particle tracks in water, for a 5.4 MeV α-particle (top left), for electrons generated following the absorption of a 1.5 keV X-ray photon (top right) and electrons generated during the decay of iodine-125.]]

The [[W:Linear_energy_transfer|Linear Energy Transfer]] ('''LET''') is defined as the energy released per unit length of the track of an ionizing particle. A slowly moving, highly charged particle therefore has a substantially higher LET than a fast, singly charged particle.  An alpha particle of 5 MeV energy and an electron of 1 MeV energy have LETs, for instance, of 95 and 0.25 keV/μm, respectively.  The ionization density and hence the energy deposition pattern associated with the heavier charged particle is very much greater than that arising from electrons, as illustrated in the figure above.

The energy transferred along the track of a charged particle will vary because the velocity of the particle is likely to be continuously decreasing. Each interaction removes a small amount of energy from the particle so that the LET gradually increases along a particle track with a dramatic 
increase (called the [[W:Bragg_Peak|Bragg Peak]]) occurring just before the particle comes to rest.

The [http://www.icru.org/ International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements] ('''ICRU''') suggest that '''lineal energy''' is a better indicator of relative biological effectiveness ('''RBE''').  Although lineal energy has the same units as LET (e.g. keV/μm), it is defined as the:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;ratio of the energy deposited in a volume of tissue to the average diameter of that volume.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Since the microscopic deposition of energy may be quite anisotropic, lineal energy should be a more appropriate measure of potential damage than that of LET.  The ICRU and the [[W:ICRP|ICRP]] have accordingly recommended that the radiation effectiveness of a particular radiation type should be based on lineal energy in a 1 μm diameter sphere of tissue. The lineal energy can be calculated for any given radiation type and energy and a [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Units_of_Radiation_Measurement#The_Absorber|Radiation Weighting Factor]], (w&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) can then be determined based on the integrated values of lineal energy along the radiation track.

All living things on this planet have been exposed to ionizing radiation since the dawn of time.  The current situation for humans is summarized in the following table:

&lt;BR&gt;

The sum total of this [[W:Background_radiation|''Natural'' Background Radiation]] is about 2.5 mSv per year, with large variations depending on altitude and dietary intake as well as geological and geographical location.

Its generally considered that repair mechanisms exist in living matter and that these can be invoked following radiation damage at the biomolecular level. These mechanisms are likely to have an [[W:Evolution|evolutionary]] basis arising as a response to radiation fluxes generated by natural background sources over the aeons. Its also known that quite considerable damage to tissues can arise at quite higher radiation fluxes, even at [http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/rsnaii.html medical exposures]. Cell death and transformations to malignant states can result leading to latent periods of many years before clinical signs of cancer or leukemia, for instance, become manifest. Further treatment of this vast field of [[W:Radiation_biology|radiation biology]] however is beyond our scope here.

== Practical Radiation Safety ==

Radiation hazards arise since nuclear medicine involves the handling of radioactive materials. Although this risk may be small, it remains important to keep occupational exposures as low as reasonably achievable. Essential practices for achieving this aim include:

&lt;b&gt;Administration&lt;/b&gt;
::*Maintaining a comprehensive record of all radioactive source purchases, usage, movement and storage.
::*Ensuring that any Codes of Safe Practice are adhered to and develop sensible written protocols and working rules for handling radioisotopes.
::*Protocols for dealing with minor contamination incidents of the environment or of staff members must be established. Remember that no matter how good work practices are, minor accidents or incidents involving spillage of radioisotopes can take place.
&lt;b&gt;Facility&lt;/b&gt;
::*Storage of radioactive sources in a secure shielded environment. Specially dedicated facilities are required for the storage, safe handling, manipulation and dispensing of unsealed radioactive sources. Storage areas should be designed for both bulk radioisotope and radioactive waste. Furthermore, radioactive patients should be regarded as unsealed sources.
::*Adequate ventilation of any work area. This is particularly important to minimize the inhalation of Technigas and potentially volatile radioisotopes such as I-125 and I-131. It is preferable to use fume hoods when working with volatile materials.
::*Benches should be manufactured with smooth, hard impervious surfaces with appropriate splash-backs to allow ready decontamination following any spillage of radioisotopes. Laboratory work should be performed in stainless steel trays lined with absorbent paper.
::*Excretion of radioactive materials by patients may be via faeces, urine, saliva, blood, exhaled breath or the skin. Provision to deal with any or all of these potential pathways for contamination must be made.
::*Provision for collection and possible storage of both liquid and solid radioactive waste may be necessary in some circumstances. Most short-lived, water soluble liquid waste can be flushed into the sewers but longer lived isotopes such as I-131 may have to be stored for decay. Such waste must be adequately contained and labelled during storage.
&lt;b&gt;Equipment&lt;/b&gt;
::*Ensure that appropriate survey monitors are available to determine if any contamination has occurred and to assist in decontamination procedures. Routine monitoring of potentially contaminated areas must be performed.
::*Ensure that all potentially exposed staff are issued with individual personnel monitors.
::*Protective clothing such as gowns, smocks, overboots and gloves should be provided and worn to prevent contamination of the personnel handling the radioactivity. In particular, gloves must be worn when administering radioactive materials orally or intravenously to patients. It should be noted that penetration of gloves may occur when handling some iodine compounds so that wearing a second pair of gloves is recommended. In any event, gloves should be changed frequently and discarded ones treated as radioactive waste.
&lt;b&gt;Behaviours&lt;/b&gt;
::*Eating and drinking of food, smoking, and the application of cosmetics is prohibited in laboratories in which unsealed sources are utilized.
::*Mouth pipetting of any radioactive substance is totally prohibited. 
::*Precautions should be taken to avoid punctures, cuts, abrasions and any other open skin wounds which otherwise might allow egress of radiopharmaceuticals into the blood stream.
&lt;b&gt;Optimization&lt;/b&gt;
::*Always ensure that there is a net benefit resulting from the patient procedure. Can the diagnosis or treatment be made by recourse to an alternative means using non ionizing radiation?
::*Ensure that all staff, including physicians, technologists, nurses and interns and other students, who are involved in the practice of nuclear medicine receive the relevant level of training and education appropriate to their assigned tasks. The training program could be in the form of seminars, refresher courses and informal tutorials.
::*A substantive Quality Assurance (QA) program should be implemented to ensure that the function of the Dose Calibrator, Gamma Camera, computer and other ancillary equipment is optimized.

The potential hazards to staff in a nuclear medicine environment include:

::*Milking the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc generator, drawing up and measuring the quantity of radioisotope prior to administration.
::*Delivering the activity to the patient by injection or other means and positioning the now radioactive patient in the imaging device.
::*Removing the patients from the imaging device and returning them to the ward where they may continue to represent a radiation hazard for some time. For Tc-99m, a short-lived radionuclide the hazard period will be only a few hours but for therapeutic isotopes the hazardous period may be several days.
::*Disposal of radioactive waste including body fluids, such as blood and urine, but also swabs, syringes, needles, paper towels etc.
::*Cleaning up the imaging area after the procedure.
::*Contamination.

The table below lists the dose rates from patients having nuclear medicine examinations. In general, the hazards from handling or dealing with radioactive patients arise in two parts:

::*External hazard: This will be the case when the radioisotope emits penetrating gamma-rays. Usually, this hazard can be minimised by employing shielding and sensible work practices.
::*Radioactive contamination: This is potentially of more concern as it may lead to the inhalation or ingestion of radioactive material by staff. Possible sources of contamination are radioactive blood, urine and saliva, emanating from a patient, or airborne radioactive vapour. Sensible work practices, which involve high levels of personal hygiene, should ensure that contamination is not a major issue.

[[File:nmPtDoseRates.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Dose rates from patients following administration.]]

One of the most common nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures is the bone scan using the isotope Tc-99m. The exposure rate at 1 metre from a typical patient will peak at approximately 3 μSv per hour immediately after injection dropping steadily because of radioactivity decay and through excretion so that after 2 hours it will be about 1.5 μSv per hour. Neglecting any further excretion, the total exposure received by an individual, should that person stand one meter from the patient for the whole of the first 24 hours, would be ~17 μSv. For a person at 3 meters from the patient this number would reduce to 1.7 μSv and for a distance of 5 metres it would be ~0.7 μSv. These values have been estimated on the basis of the inverse square law.

Patients should be encouraged to drink substantial quantities of liquid following their scan, as this will improve excretion and aid in minimizing not only their radiation dose but also that of nursing staff.

== Tenets ==

I, like most everyone, have several [[w:wiktionary:tenet|tenet]]s which guide my actions.

=== Logic and God ===
One tenet is that if logic were accepted as superior to God&lt;ref&gt;Logical definition of God: &quot;The first entity to have reduced to minimum form instantaneously an infinite ('''unbounded''') number of logical equations with an infinite number variables having an infinite number of states.&quot; God exists logically therefore by definition in the same sense that by definition the center of a circle, sphere or barycenter exists or that an asymptote can be known. Faith being that which transcends reason based on hard, cold fact by a mind unable to process an unlimited number of variables. &lt;/ref&gt; and put into place as the basis for any system then the system would eventually have to be turned over to the control of a computer since computers are known to be potentially superior to humans in the number of variables they can [http://academia.wikia.com/wiki/A_Method_for_Simulating_the_Process_of_Logical_Human_Thought#Harvard_Basic_v11 handle]; depriving humans the right of autonomy and taking that right for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;A similar condition already exists for some with money. In their thinking money can handle more variables than they so they have allowed money to confiscate their autonomy and take their autonomy for itself. However, God can still handle more variables than money.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with doing that is a computer is limited in the number of variables it can handle compared not to humans but to God. A computer can not handle nearly quite so many.&lt;ref&gt;  For more details behind this reasoning you will find them [http://academia.wikia.com/wiki/A_Method_for_Simulating_the_Process_of_Logical_Human_Thought here]. &lt;/ref&gt; Therefore God remains the superior choice upon which to base any system.

=== Food and Exercise ===

The stomach and the heart(pump) are organs of the body under constant warfare with each other. In the end if the stomach wins you do not.

=== Smoking and the EARTH ===

In additions to stopping humans from smoking there is a need to [[w:Biochar|'''''stop the EARTH from smoking''''']].

HIGH tech startup facilities necessary to produce commercial grades and volume of biochar, bio-oil and syngas from municipal and agricultural organic waste requires a minimum investment of at least $100,000 per unit. LOW tech production can be started for much less.

Finding individuals and funding in each city or town to help get a high tech system started in the local community will stop the EARTH from smoking.

=== Living within your means ===

Borrow less than you invest, invest less than you save, when possible, save more than you spend and always spend less than you earn.

However, if you create work using Blender, the work itself is your own property and you can give it whatever license you want. If there are any screenshots of Blender using other copyright tags than {{tl|GPL}}, please correct them if you can.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Ada and the JVM ==

The Ada&amp;rarr;J-Code compilers translate Ada programs directly
to Java bytecode for the Virtual Machine.
Both Ada programmers and Java programmers can use each other's
classes almost seamlessly, including inheritance.
Ada adds desirable language features like a strong base type system and
full generics,
Java VMs add garbage collection and a rich set of libraries.

{{Quote|&amp;ldquo;Almost every Ada 95 feature has a very direct mapping using J-code, and almost every capability of J-code is readily represented in some Ada 95 construct.&amp;rdquo;|Taft, 1996}}

There are (at least) two compilers that support this: AppletMagic and JGNAT.
The following example assumes AppletMagic. Changes required to make them
work with JGNAT should be minimal. Some are explained in due course.

Ada programs for JVMs (see for example [[Programming:J2ME]])
appear to be surprisingly smooth. Unlike creating, and sometimes using,
a binding to some library, using Ada&amp;rarr;J-code compilers will make
binding issues disappear.


=== Naming Conventions ===

AppletMagic and JGNAT use naming conventions for deciding how to distribute
compiled code across Java class files. When a (tagged) type together with its
surrounding package should be mapped to one Java class file, AppletMagic
requires the type name to have a known suffix, and otherwise to be the
same as the package name:

 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Foo {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Foo_Obj {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}} ...
 
    ...
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Foo{{Ada/delimiter|;}}


Similarly, JGNAT has some conventions that effectively turn type names into
key words. These names tend to be short, and general, here is &lt;tt&gt;Typ&lt;/tt&gt;:

 {{Ada/keyword|package}} Foo {{Ada/keyword|is}}
 
    {{Ada/keyword|type}} Typ {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}} ...
 
    ...
 
 {{Ada/keyword|end}} Foo{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

=== Java Uses References, So Does Ada, Then ===

The mapping of Java's primitive types to corresponding Ada types
is straightforward. (The semantics of integer types differ
between the languages when the values approach a subtype's limits.
JVM integers can jump from positive to negative when adding in
excess of the maximum integer, Ada programs should not permit this.
The compiler docs will explain to what extent Ada semantics will be
preserved on the JVM.)

For reference types&amp;mdash;everything is allocated in the heap&amp;mdash;there
is another convention.

   {{Ada/keyword|package}} Foo {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   
      {{Ada/keyword|type}} Foo_Obj {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|tagged}} {{Ada/keyword|null}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
      {{Ada/keyword|type}} Foo_Ptr {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|access}} {{Ada/keyword|all}} Foo_Obj{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Class}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   
      {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} Op{{Ada/delimiter|(}}x{{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|access}} Foo_Obj{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   
   {{Ada/keyword|end}} Foo{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

(JGNAT sources use &lt;tt&gt;Ref&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;Foo_Ptr&lt;/tt&gt;.)
The classwide pointers can be used just like Java references.
Notice that primitive operations can have {{Ada/keyword|access}}
parameters. This is a natural choice when interfacing to Java.

When Ada programmers wish to use Java objects in their
programs, they will see the Java classes as normal
packages, and the objects following the conventions outlined above.
The compilers offer tools for creating
Ada packages from Java .class files.
Given the Java class Foo, the Ada package will be as show below.
&lt;source lang=java&gt;
   public class Foo
   {
      public void op() {};
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
   {{Ada/keyword|with}} java.lang{{Ada/delimiter|;}} {{Ada/keyword|use}} java.lang{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   {{Ada/keyword|package}} Foo {{Ada/keyword|is}}
   
       {{Ada/comment| pragma Preelaborate; -- uncomment where possible}}
       {{Ada/keyword|type}} Foo_Obj {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|new}} Object {{Ada/keyword|with}} {{Ada/keyword|null}} {{Ada/keyword|record}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
       {{Ada/keyword|type}} Foo_Ptr {{Ada/keyword|is}} {{Ada/keyword|access}} {{Ada/keyword|all}} Foo_Obj{{Ada/delimiter|'}}{{Ada/attribute|Class}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   
       {{Ada/keyword|function}} new_Foo{{Ada/delimiter|(}}this {{Ada/delimiter|:}} Foo_Ptr {{Ada/delimiter|1=:=}} {{Ada/keyword|null}}{{Ada/delimiter|)}} {{Ada/keyword|return}} Foo_Ptr{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   
       {{Ada/keyword|procedure}} op{{Ada/delimiter|(}}this {{Ada/delimiter|:}} {{Ada/keyword|access}} Foo_Obj{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   
       {{Ada/pragma|Import}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Java{{Ada/delimiter|,}} op{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   
       {{Ada/pragma|Import}} {{Ada/delimiter|(}}Java_Constructor{{Ada/delimiter|,}} new_Foo{{Ada/delimiter|)}}{{Ada/delimiter|;}}
   
   {{Ada/keyword|end}} Foo{{Ada/delimiter|;}}

; new_Foo : This is a constructor function corresponding to the default constructor of the Java type. (Usually you won't be concerned with default constructors.) There is a special convention identifier for constructors, &lt;tt&gt;Java_Constructor&lt;/tt&gt;.
; {{Ada/pragma|Import}} : As both the constructor and the &lt;tt&gt;op&lt;/tt&gt; method are defined in the Java class, they will be imported just like when importing C, or Fortran functions, using convention identifiers &lt;tt&gt;Java_Constructor&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;Java&lt;/tt&gt;, respectively.

=== Constructors ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">nice to hear from you. Anyweays give me a link and i'll see how it can fit in. I believe in fun applications of physics and how it relates to the rest of us. The thing which needs to be emphasized is about &quot;creativity&quot; and how it relates to solving problems in science. Generally you could do lesson like &quot;okay, class. We learned about Force today. Now, this weekends homework is draw me a picture of how forces are involved in real life&quot; etc. etc.

Anyways my mail is Compatta@yahoo.com and i also like this other site called:

www.makezine.com

Emphasizes how &quot;creativity&quot; can be used to solve common engineering problems (i call it the hobbyists physics of how to make stuff without knowing too much physics)

www.instructables.com

great site to make stuff.

I hope to collaborate with you in the future.</text>

:Why don't you think highschoolers will understand this?  Is the issue derivatives and calculus?  Trig identities and quadratic formulas should be fine. (If you want to contact me directly, see my Wikipedia account [[w:User:Samw]]) [[User:Samw|Samw]] 00:20, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

'''To the author of this article:'''  I am not familiar with Wiki Books in general, but I also believe that this would be a difficult resource for high school students to use.  I am looking for texts right now that would be suitable for high school physics students, and I am most likely not going to use this one.  Honestly there was something I was confused about by the second sentence.  The first problem I have with this is that the author makes reference to more complicated situations before the simple ones have been thoroughly conveyed.  For example, clarifying that you are referring to flat ground isn't preferable when first introducing the physics of flat ground projectile motion.  Only when readers are comfortable with flat ground situations will they want/need a distinction between flat and non-flat situations to be made.  Another example is how in the derivation section polar coordinates are used.  Students trying to understand projectile motion for the first time will often not be familiar with polar coordinates or at least will not be comfortable enough to utilize them while learning a new topic.  Also, all of the derivations are highly mathematical with little physical interpretation.  The way this system is mathematically modeled is confusing to a reader who doesn't already understand projectile motion.  Someone who is good at math can read this article, be able to reproduce all of its results mathematically, yet still fail to understand how this relates to the real world uniform gravitational field that that we essentially live in.  The title &quot;High School Physics / Projectile Motion&quot; implies that this article is written to be a resource for high school students learning projectile motion.  If the goal of this article is to help students understand projectile motion, then it is not accomplishing that.  May I ask what your credentials are as an educator of physics? (I ask this not in an attempt to discredit the article or your work, but because I find many well educated people have misconceptions about how students learn and thus need to have this pointed out to them).  This article, as it is written, is probably fine if it's targeted at readers who already understand projectile motion physically (to some extent), and simply want to expand or reinforce on the mathematical background.  I'll discuss this with you at a later date if you wish. --[[User:129.2.239.111|129.2.239.111]] 05:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
:I don't claim any expertise in education.  I think this is useful material.  However, if there is a better location for this in Wikibooks (e.g. an undergrad textbook), go ahead and move it there. (Maybe my age is showing, but when I went to high school, we did polar coordinates and calculus.)  By all means feel free to add physical descriptions or otherwise improve the article.

* [[Modern Greek/Appendix I|Appendix I: Declensions and Conjugations]]
== Lesson Plan ==

Each chapter is given a outline of its content and the reasoning behind it.

* Alphabet, Reading and Pronounciation
: You need to read the language before learning it.
* Genders of nouns and cases
: The Basis of a sentence is a verb subject and object.  This is part of the basis for this
* Pronouns
: Pronouns are some of the simplest words and yet the most used.
* Basic verbs and First Conjugation 
: Verbs are needed for basic sentences.  But without nouns nothing decent can be expressed.
* Dialog
: Saying, hello and goodbye is fundamental.  Most often the first thing learnt by a person.
* Numbers and Time
: Important when getting around.  Think about platform 1 and train leaving at 8:20.
* Days of the week
* Buying Something
* The subjunctive and the Aorist and Progressive
* Second Conjugation
* Transportation
* And so on...
* Appendix
: This is for useful comments on slight changes due to dialect.  Varying ways of saying numbers. Slang for certain areas if it is useful.

The question is whether it is better to have the Dialog in the second lesson but be unable to fully explain it. Or to have it later and be able to explain everything.--[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 20:49, 5 June 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Mt. Volta, there lived two types of people. The ones who saved their money and were always &quot;potential&quot; candidates for robbery and the &quot;kinetics,&quot; a gang of young electrons that always liked to steal the &quot;jeules&quot; from the calm, yet saving potential People. In a way, there always seemed to be the same number of jeules between the two because everytime the kinetics robbed from the potentials, they always seemed to spend jeules at the stores of the potentals.

Similarly, Potential energy is stored energy (people who like to save their jeules) and Kinetic Energy is energy being used.

Energy, when it is tranferred, can be thought about in the following ways:

Electrical enegy-The type which runs your mp3 players and personal electronics
Mechanical energy-What is takes to move something.
Heat energy-The warmth in your cup of hot chocolate.
Wave energy-These are the vibrations you feel from music or sound and make listening possible. More than sounds are wave energy.

in this case, you will be studying the energy involved with motion. In essence, their are two types
of energy you will be studying:

Potential Energy (U)-The energy you store up. A measure of what could happen.

&lt;math&gt;Potential\,\,Energy=\frac{1}{2} Mass \cdot (Velocity)^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;or\,\,\,\,\,U=\frac{1}{2} m \cdot v^2&lt;/math&gt;

Kinetic Energy (K)-The energy you use.

&lt;math&gt;Kinetic\,\,Energy=\frac{1}{2} Mass \cdot (Velocity)^2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;or\,\,\,\,\, K=\frac{1}{2} m \cdot v^2&lt;/math&gt;

Did you notice that both the equation are the same? Well you observed right because in the world their is this concept called &quot;conservation of energy&quot; which means no amount of energy is created or lost in the process. Similarly, we mentioned that Jeules always seemed to be saved and spent at the same time. So, can we say

Potential Energy = Kinetic Energy

of COURSE we can!!

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Numbers and Time=

==Numbers==
The Greek words from 1 to 10 are presented along with English words derived from them: 
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ένα
| unary
|-
| δύο
| duet
|-
| τρία
| trio
|-
| τέσσερα
| tesseract
|-
| πεντε
| pentagon
|-
| έξι
| hexagon
|-
| επτά
| heptathlon
|-
| οκτώ
| octopus
|-
| εννέα
| ennead
|-
| δέκα
| decathlon
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=2e}}

The Greek word for ''one'' also serves as the indefinite article and changes case like this:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| ένας
| ''one,'' masculine subject
|-
| έναν
| ''one,'' masculine object
|-
|-
| μία or μια
| ''one,'' feminine subject
|-
| μία or μια
| ''one,'' feminine object
|-
|-
| ένα
| ''one,'' neuter subject
|-
| ένα
| ''one,'' neuter object
|-
|}

(The genitive forms are covered in lesson 3.)

Example:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Ενας σκύλος δαγκώνει έναν άνθρωπο.
| A dog bites a man.
|-
|}
==Time==
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Η ώρα είναι οκτώ.
| The time is eight o'clock.
|-
| Είναι οκτώ.
| It's eight o'clock.
|-
| Είναι οκτώ και δέκα.
| It's ten past eight.
|}

Because ώρα is feminine, the feminine forms of the numbers are used for time:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Είναι τέσσερις.
| It's four o'clock.
|-
|}

Vocabulary:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| παρά (short of)
| in expressions of time, &quot;to&quot;
|-
| και (and)
| in expressions of time, &quot;past&quot;
|-
| ακριβώς (exactly)
| in expressions of time, &quot;sharp&quot;
|-
| μισή
| half (feminine form, used with the feminine ώρα)
|-
| τέταρτο
| quarter 
|}

Examples:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Είναι οκτώ παρά δέκα.
| It's ten to eight.
|-
| Είναι οκτώ ακριβώς.
| It's eight o'clock sharp.
|-
| Είναι οκτώ και μισή.
| It's half past eight.
|-
| Είναι οκτώ και τέταρτο.
| It's quarter past eight.
|}
===Vocabulary relating to time===
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| το πρωί
| the morning
|-
| το μεσημέρι
| the noon
|-
| το απόγευμα
| the afternoon
|-
| το βράδυ
| the evening
|-
| η νύχτα
| the night
|-
| το ρολόι
| the clock (~Spanish &quot;reloj&quot;)
|-
| νωρίς
| early
|-
| αργά
| late
|}

====Usage of noon, afternoon etc.====

Be careful, the words may have the same literal meaning, but they do not correspond to the same time! Morning is between 5am to 12pm. Noon for Greeks is approximately between 12pm to 4pm. The afternoon is approximately between 4 to 8pm. The evening is from 8pm to 12am and the night comes afterwards. However in actual speech &quot;night&quot; is rarely used when specifying the time. Usually both &quot;evening&quot; and &quot;morning&quot; are used for times between 1am and 2am. Afterwards it is always &quot;morning&quot;. Although, if asked, people will refer to the time between 3am and 5am as &quot;night&quot;, when specifying the time they will refer to it as &quot;morning&quot;. 

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
| Γιατί με ξυπνάς στις τρεις το πρωί;
| Why are you waking me up at three o'clock in the morning?
|-
| Μείναμε στο εστιατόριο μέχρι τις δύο to βράδυ.
| We stayed at the restaurant until two o'clock in the evening.

This is the way I would assume that it would be said.  Is capitalising standard?
Is the form of my question right?  Is it idiomatic?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Chimaera was a fire-breathing beast with the body of a goat, the head of a lion and a snake for a tail. Other descriptions also attribute to it an additional head of a goat. It was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna. Its pairing with its brother Orthrus produced the [[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Nemean Lion|Nemean Lion]] and the [[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Sphinx|Sphinx]]. 

Sighting the Chimaera was an omen of storms, shipwrecks and natural disasters, particularly volcanoes.

It was slain by the hero [[Greek Mythology/Heroes/Bellerophon|Bellerophon]] with help from his flying steed [[Greek Mythology/Beasts/Pegasus|Pegasus]], under orders from King Iobates of Lycia. There are multiple descriptions of how this was done. According to one, Bellerophon used his spear. Another says he fitted a chunk of lead to his weapon, which melted by the heat of the Chimera's breath and consequently burnt the creature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Sentences=
The order of words in a Greek sentence is much more free than in English, but you can correctly construct a sentence using the familiar English syntax of subject+verb, or subject+verb+object. The subject is usually omitted when it is a pronoun.

Sentences:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   Είναι καλό.
| It is good.
|-
|   Είναι κακό.
| It is bad.
|-
 |}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1l}}

In Greek, adjectives change their endings to agree with the gender and number of the nouns
they describe (''declension''). The following vocabulary list introduces some nouns that happen to be neuter,
and some adjectives, which are given in neuter form. The word το is the definite article, like English &quot;the,&quot; used with
singular neuter nouns.

Vocabulary:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   νερό
| water
|-
|   κρασί
| wine
|-
| τσάι

| cold
|-
| άσπρο

|-
| κόκκινο

|-
| θέλω
| to want
 |}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1m}}

Sentences:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   Το νερό είναι κρύο.
| The water is cold
|-
|   Το κρασί είναι κρύο.

| The tea is hot.
|-
|   Το άσπρο κρασί είναι κρύο.
| The white wine is cold.
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1n}}

Negatives are formed by placing ''δεν'' before the verb. The question mark in Greek is the semicolon.

Sentences:
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;
|   Το κόκκινο κρασί δεν είναι κρύο.
| The red wine is not cold
|-
|   Το νερό δεν είναι καυτό. 
| The water is not hot.
|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1o}}

| Hello.
|-
|  Χαίρετε.
| Hello.
|-
|   Έχετε τσάι;
| Do you have tea?
|-
|   Οχι, δεν έχουμε τσάι. Θέλετε νερό;

=Money/To χρήμα, τα λεφτά=


Greece uses the euro, το ευρώ, as its currency. One hundredth of a euro is ενα λεπτό. Both words are neuter, and the plural and singular forms of ευρώ are the same.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;

The purpose of this book is to collaboratively share a collection of learning/training best practices across many different organizations. For definition purposes, a best practice is something that can be replicated at multiple locations, expecting similar results; and not just something that worked well inside an organization. 

We welcome you to add stories, examples, as well as documented, results-oriented best practices to this Wiki, entitled &quot;Training Best Practices,&quot; so that others may use them to develop learning strategies at their organizations.

The initial book started as part of a Learning Lab at Training Directors Forum on June 16, 2006 in Palm Springs, California.

== About the Authors ==
The initial group of authors who started this project, were assembled for an onsite, Wiki lab at Training Directors Forum, June 13, 2006 in Palm Springs, California. The book was added to by a group of most excellent authors at Training Conference 2007 in Orlando, Florida on February 28, 2007. The audience is made of up of Training Managers and Training Executives. If you are not part of this group, but would like to contribute best practice examples to this book, please feel free to do so, and be sure to add your name, title, company and bio to the &quot;'''About the Authors'''&quot; section.

Additional content was added February 28, 2007 by participants of the Training 2007 Conference from Disney World.

== Title: ==

 AFTB Class for Total Army Family (Soldier, Civilian, Contractors and their Family members)

== Description: ==

Network Information Officer

== Methods Used ==

Ice breaker to develop self confidence.
Brainstorming and workgroup exercises to get them involve
Minimize the amount of time by using powerpoint slide show.

== Results ==

This class mostly benefited families living overseas to know each other, build relationship, help each other and working as a team.

== Technologies Used ==

On line training and microsoft powerpoint.

== Lessons Learned ==

* Many learning modules have a short shelf life, so the most cost-efficient way to produce the content is through SME-developed, rapid authoring using PowerPoint.

* In many cases, you don’t need an LMS to launch and track the learning. The content map approach provides more flexibility when accessing learning content.

* Competencies should most often be measured on-the-job and not through online learning. Online learning works well for teaching, but assess outside the course using more traditional measures.

* If more interaction is needed for instructional purposes, add a “learn more” link to provide additional opportunities. These can be online, such as simulations, or perhaps can even give someone an assignment to talk to another person or engage in on-the-job learning.

* Content stored in PowerPoint is much easier to translate than content organized in other authoring tools.

* PowerPoint-converted learning can be used for self-paced learning, but many people overlook its potential for using the same material for group learning in a classroom setting. We’ve found that it works great for facilitated learning.

== Putting Together An Inexpensive PowerPoint On-line Module, by Michael McGinnis ==

The question I am most often asked is how do you create your on-line training programs. When I respond by stating that all we use is PowerPoint, the most common reaction is a look of puzzlement or shame. Those with the puzzled looks are amazed at the response, often anticipating some name of an expensive content development application or company that we outsource this to. Those with the shamed reaction are often looking down and wondering why are we so primitive.

The answer lies in the fact that we have been incredibly successful using this approach, an approach I refer to as Keeping It Simple and Straightforward (KISS). The background for how we developed our successful on-line learning center further exemplifies how companies can reap the rewards of on-line learning without having to spend much (see articles on “e-learning on a shoestring” and “LMS on a shoestring”). This article will provide you with a step-by-step tutorial for how we develop our modules. 

Another key point to stress up front is the resources that we use, or better said, don’t use, to develop our training. Part of my KISS methodology for training has shown us that we do not need instructional designers, multimedia specialists, web developers, etc. as a part of our training department. Instead, I simply turn on a small group of technical and soft skill trainers, and a ton of subject matter experts, to using PowerPoint. Here is how we do it.

=== Step 1. Instructional Design ===

Still basic to developing training is applying the basics for instructional design. The figure below includes the steps I use to guide the instructor or subject matter expert to create the module. Instructors quickly get the hang of this. What I have found that works the best is to have the developer review some of the existing on-line modules. I often walk through a couple of modules to show how we put them together. 

I explain the basic premise for instruction using the Tell Me, Show Me, Let Me and Assess Me design criteria, and state that the module can accomplish most of the Tell Me and Show Me steps. After they have completed the form and we have walked through sample modules, we begin by creating a basic agenda. From this they are set to go and begin their first draft. 
  
=== Step 2. Drafting the Presentation ===

Most of us recognize and agree that PowerPoint is a powerful presentation tool. However, this paradigm can get in the way of using PowerPoint as a content developer tool. Like any paradigm we tend to live within the parameters of the program, or in this case the standard set of slide design templates. 

Instead I stress the point that what you really have is a blank piece of paper with a lot of possibility. Initially I used other content development packages but found them limiting when it came to applying basic animation to the slides. Simply placing an arrow or square around an object required a lot of extra steps. In addition were the license fees and learning curve associated with these applications. What I wanted was a tool that our technical trainers could easily learn and use to capture the large number of training needs and requests. 

The information collected in Step 1 gave us the information we needed to create the draft. The example used below is typical of the type of training request we would receive. There was a problem that was driving the need for people to behave differently. The module would describe the current issue, the change that is needed and what will need to be done differently. The first few slides include the detail that would be completed for each slide. 

Note: I would consider myself an intermediate skilled user of PowerPoint. Therefore there most likely are easier ways to accomplish what I suggest below. I continually learn of new techniques that are more effective or add new possibilities. The irony is that I learned the most from our technical trainers who had minimal to no PowerPoint experience prior to learning these steps. Once they created a couple of modules, they discovered how easy it really was. Most had so much fun creating these modules, that I often had to remind them to spend more time on the floor or perform their other assigned tasks. By searching the internet they were quick to find other inexpensive to free tools that they could use. 

The following provides you with a step-by-step tutorial of how we build a typical technical or leadership training module using PowerPoint, version 2002. 
Title Page

Figure 1. Drafting the Title Slide
The information below was used to storyboard what we wanted to include in this slide. We included the slide content, script in the Instructor Notes section and selected a Slide Design.

Title: 
The Importance Of Visual Inspection

Other Content: 
Visuals relating to theme, “You are the last set of eyes before the customer sees our product”. Get picture of eyes.

Script: 
Welcome to the module on Packout, the importance of visual inspection. Due to the quantity of escaping defects that have left this plant and ended up in our customer’s hands, along with the costs associated with this, we are now requiring that only specified employees perform this role and have the training to ensure that they are identifying visual defects before they are packed out

Slide Design: 
PowerPoint provides users with a variety of choices of slide designs to use. These can be accessed by clicking on Format and then selecting on Slide Design… However, these designs are often overused and seen wherever PowerPoint presentations are given. There are vast amounts of slides designs and templates available via the Internet, ranging from free to custom designed. You can buy CD’s filled with templates for all types of occasions. To date I have never purchased a template. 

In some cases we have opted to create our own template for modules that relate to a specific business division, where the audience is management, or for our own training department. For our training department we created our own template using the Drawing toolbar and our logo. In other cases, we copied and inserted logos from our company Intranet or Internet sites (just be sure to check with your company policies regarding usage of company logos).

Okay, so far we have completed the basic instructional design of the module. So what tools are needed to transform this into an interactive on-line module to include audio, digital images and video, and animation. 

==== Images ====

Images can be acquired using screen shots off of the PC, downloading images from a digital camera, clip art, or other types of stored images (.gif, jpg). Pictures are inserted into the PowerPoint file and therefore cause the file size to increase. File size will be considered later in this paper along with some options we have found to reduce file size when this needs to be considered. 

Even though the images are copied to the PowerPoint file once they have been inserted, we store all images into the folder where the PowerPoint file will be saved. We create a subfolder in this folder entitled, “Images”. This helps us to create a sort of library allowing us to more easily find stored images. 

PowerPoint provides you with a basic means to edit the image once it is inserted. The majority of images we use have been taken using our digital camera or from screen shots taken on our PC. Approximately 90% of the edits we make are cropping the picture and adjusting the brightness and contrast (see Figure 2). We then place a border around each picture to accent it in the slide. If more sophisticated graphic editing is required, there are a number of editing applications on the market. Although rarely used, we use Paint Shop Pro in these situations. These applications can also be used to reduce the size of images by saving them into various formats (e.g. .gif). However be sure to try Microsoft’s own Paint application along with a variety of inexpensive editors available on the Internet.

We limit the use of clip art since it is our opinion that this can easily be overused. However, they are useful when we want to introduce a feeling which can be demonstrated by an unhappy face, downward sloping sales chart, dollar bills, etc. We will also select clip art when we want to break up the text on a screen and no picture we can take makes sense. Clip art is readily available on the Internet. Microsoft has an extensive library of clip art. Another recent find are the images available on the Google search engine. 





















Figure 2. Formatting A Picture

In this example a picture was inserted into the slide. To format, right click on the picture and select Format Picture. The menu appears as shown above. Selecting the Picture tab provides you with the opportunity to crop the picture and edit the brightness and contrast levels. In most cases with pictures from our digital camera, we click once on the Brightness and Contrast bars just to the right of the box in the middle which will increase the brightness and contrast to 60% to make the image more presentable. To place a border around a picture, which is suggested to accent the picture, select the Colors and Lines tab, and in the Line section, choose a color form the drop down menu and then choose a line Style. Figure 2 has such a border that was created using these steps.


We will often animate a sequence of our own images and clip art in order to demonstrate a point or make for a more enjoyable presentation. For example, we wanted to place a visual emphasizing the other costs. To accomplish this, we placed a clip art picture of a trash can and had pictures of; bag of money, losing money, and a text box, dropping into the trash can (see Figure 3). 



 





























Figure 3. Using Clip Art To Demonstrate A Point. 
Clip art was used in this case to emphasize that there are significant costs associated with this particular issue. To emphasize this we found clip art for the trash can, bag of money and declining profits chart. We created a text box with the word “JOBS”. Each of these was inserted into the PowerPoint and then animated. In this case the effect used was Motion Path which allowed us to simulate these items being thrown into the trash can.  Note: you will also have to consider the order of the objects. In this case, we wanted items to go behind the trash can, therefore keeping the trash can on top. This was accomplished by clicking on the “Draw” button on the drawing toolbar, then selecting “Order”.  


We often wanted to highlight or refer to a specific area in the picture. Here we used the various graphic tools supplied with PowerPoint. Arrows pointed to a specific area of the product showing a defect. In other cases, a box or circle surrounded an area we wanted to draw the users attention to (note: most objects such as circles and squares once inserted are filled with a color as the default. You can erase the filling by clicking on the tipping paint can button on the drawing toolbar, and then selecting “No Fill”. Check out the “Fill Effects” link to discover two tone fills, fill designs, degrees of transparency, etc.). One issue I found with some other content developers was that adding graphics was more complicated than with PowerPoint. PowerPoint makes it very easy to add a graphic such as an arrow, box or circle and then modify its size, fill color, line width, line color or direction. 


Text boxes or callout boxes are often used to provide an explanation to an image or graphic. This can prevent the need to create bulleted lists which take up space. These boxes can also be animated and timed so that they appear only when referencing a specific area of a picture and then erased later in the slide (see Figure 4).


Figure 4. Here is an example of using PowerPoint to simulate an application. We took screen shots of each step in the application (using Shift, Print Screen on the keyboard, or you can use a screen capture program). These were layered over each other and animated to provide the appearance of a new screen or menu appearing. On each screen, we used the various drawing images to reference particular parts of the form. A callout box was introduced to emphasize a key point. On the right you can see that there were a number of images placed in an animation sequence to achieve this affect. It did take some time to get the timing to match the audio, but the result was worth it. Note: there are numerous software simulation programs that are the ideal for simulating applications, however, at a cost. 

==== Video ====

My skills in this area would most likely be considered novice to intermediate. There appears to be so much to learn in this area and many new developments. Without graphic artists or multimedia specialists on our team, we were forced to find simple ways to integrate video clips into our modules. 

What we have discovered is that if a picture is worth a thousand words, than a video is a chapter. Even a series of pictures cannot duplicate the ability to show a series of steps using a video clip. This is true of technical and soft skill training. We used videos to show how complex tasks were performed on machinery, or showed examples of soft skills being used in the work place (e.g. simulated scenario of supervisor coaching an employee and using a prescribe method). 

Video clips were taken using our digital cameras. Still images were stored on the memory stick and videos were stored on the tape, although it was possible to store both types on the stick or tape (this just made it easier to locate and download). We limited video clips to less than 30 seconds simply due to the size of the video file. In no case did we find this as a major limitation. To prevent having to edit the video if at all possible, we found that taking re-takes was quicker. Once we took the video, we would play it back on the camera and decide whether it was a keeper or not.

Video clips were downloaded in .avi format from our cameras. Although the best quality we found was the .avi format, the size of these files were very large. My ignorance on this subject must be considered here since I have no doubt that there are better techniques available than what I describe below. However, what I do describe works and is relatively easy to create. 

PowerPoint will only insert certain video formats. We purchased an inexpensive video converter (Magic Video Converter from Video-Tool.com). This allowed us to convert large .avi video format files to smaller formats that also could be inserted into PowerPoint. In most cases, we selected the .wmv (Windows Media Video) format since the file size was considerably smaller, and the quality was also compromised to some extent. We are still experimenting and learning more with video, however, what is important is that we can use it now which is an important aspect of our on-line training.

If we wanted to edit the video by cropping sections or adding text or music, we used Vegas Video. We are only using a small fraction of this application’s capability at this point. Here we crop the video, add sound tracks, add text and convert to a .wmv file. At some point we would most likely attend a class or find someone in our neighboring community to come in and instruct us on better methods for implementing video and other graphic media. 

Once again, the format you use must consider the variables of size, access time and quality. Experimentation is the key here. You must understand what is the lowest common denominator in terms of computers that will be accessing these modules. This also supports having a computer lab wherever possible to ensure that PC’s have the configuration needed to access these modules and videos are available. Always be sure to test out a module on the user PC’s before releasing it. For example, initially we only used .avi video files. In cases where the video clip was greater than 30 seconds, the download time to view was too long. 

This is what prompted us to search initially for ways to reduce the file size. Now there are ways to convert video to streaming media format, or other alternatives to make them more easily accessible. Because we access these files over our Intranet, and our network bandwidth is more than adequate, viewing larger files is possible. However, if you need to access these files over the Internet, then reducing the size of the PowerPoint file and included images/video is critical. We have just begun experimenting with Presentation Pro which converts the PowerPoint presentation into a Flash file, reducing the size dramatically. This so far has proven to be very successful and quite easy to do. In addition the cost of this application was only $399. 

==== Audio ====

We include audio with every slide in our modules. Our stance is to create a script for each slide that compliments whatever text or content included in the slide. The script matches the text on the slide in few cases (e.g. when we are creating the script for the agenda or objectives the script is the text on the slide) However, in all other cases, we use the script to expand upon the information on the slide, much as an instructor would do while using a presentation in a class. In fact that is how we create the script, by asking the instructor or subject matter expert, what they would say if they were in front of a class during that slide. 

The first few scripts will require some editing by someone on your team who has a good command of sentence structure and grammar. I suggest that you make these edits with the instructor who is developing the module, so that they learn from you as you suggest the changes. Most will improve in their ability to write their own scripts after a few modules. In some cases you may have to continue to edit certain instructor’s scripts who are less skilled in this area. The method I use to improve these skills in others is to ask them to read slowly and out loud the script they wrote. We also have one other instructor review the module prior to publishing it.

Once the script has been completed, the next step is to record it. We started off using Microsoft’s own Sound Editor or PowerPoint’s Sound Recorder (Insert…Movies and Sounds…Record Sound). In both cases, we were unsatisfied with the quality of the recording. We downloaded a few sound editors who had free trials, and then selected an inexpensive yet easy to use product, ARWizard by NowSmart Studio (www.nowsmart.com). We experimented with different settings and found those that offered good quality. Recordings were saved using the .mp3 format to limit the size of these files (see Figure 5). 

The application was simple to use and produced a higher quality sound. To record the sound, we use an inexpensive microphone headset. I recommend this since it can set on your head and you can maintain the microphone in one relative position compared to your mouth (this helps to ensure that the record level is the same for each recording). We purchased ours from Radio Shack since they have a headset with an extra long cable which is important so that you can move around freely, along with a cover on the microphone that helps to muffle outside noises. 

We set up a PC in our storage closet to minimize outside noises and providing the instructor privacy while they went through several recordings in several cases to obtain the script as they wanted it. Believe me, this is both a humorous and frustrating process at first. 












Figure 5. To use this audio develop application, we simply click on the red button (record). A menu box will appear (right) which will prompt you to name and designate a save location for the audio file. We use the MP3 format and also save the audio files in the same folder as the presentation. Audio files are saved with initials relating to the module and a number which is the slide number. This makes it easier to input the audio file into each slide. 


Initially we had our best voice in our department record all of the audio. Experience at this along with a good voice really helps. Over time I allowed the different instructors to begin to record their own modules. There was a greater sense of ownership and pride since the instructor has completed all aspect of the module by this point. In addition, this did not burden one single instructor who would fall behind in their own projects. However, you must use your judgment here since you want to ensure that your users are able to clearly understand the audio portion of the modules. Those with accents or otherwise poor recording voices should not make the recordings. 

Recording is considered by our instructors to be the most challenging aspect of creating their on-line modules initially. This is primarily due to the number of re-takes required due to making mistakes when recording. You gain the appreciation of movie directors who require continual re-takes until it is done correctly. I can tell you from my own personal experience with this, the frustration will come when you have almost completed a 2 minute recording and then you make a mistake in the last sentence. More sophisticated sound editors will allow you to re-record specific portions of your recording. At this point we find that just starting back at the beginning works the easiest. Experience definitely pays off. Recording now takes only an hour or so for a 30 slide module. This includes making the recordings and then inserting them into each slide. 

Note: I suggest that you save the audio files also in the same folder as the presentation and video files. When you save the audio for each slide, it is also suggested that you provide an abbreviated name followed by the number of the slide. For example, for the module, Final Inspection, I would name the audio file for the first slide as FI1.mp3, second slide as FI2.mp3, etc. There are times when we update the module that we may add additional slides. In these cases, the naming convention here will no longer match the new slide sequence. However, if we added a new slide # 10, we would save the audio file for this new slide as, FI10new.mp3. 

If we added slides and now wanted to modify the script and therefore re-record the audio file for a particular slide, we can easily identify the name of the audio file by right clicking on the speaker icon on the slide you are modifying, and then click on “Edit Sound Object” link, which will show you the name of the audio file. 

Once the audio files are created, the next step is to insert these into the PowerPoint slides. We use the “Insert Sound From File…” option. This places a speaker icon in the slide. It is followed by a menu prompting you to determine whether you want the audio file to play automatically when the slide is accessed, or when the user clicks the speaker icon. Most of the time we respond, “Yes”, so that the audio begins immediately once the slide is opened. We then click and drag the speaker icon to a specific area of the slide. 

In our case we save the PowerPoint files as a PowerPoint Show (.pps) format. When the user clicks on the link to open the module, it is automatically opened as a PowerPoint show. We found this works better since it eliminates the user having to launch the presentation and does not require that the user have any knowledge of how to use PowerPoint. Initially we included an opening slide to explain to the user how to navigate through the module. The audio and arrows pointed to the navigation buttons to go to the next or previous slide. We also stated that the user could replay the audio by clicking on the speaker icon. This was the advantage we found for inserting the audio in the manner we stated above. 

One of the advantages we discovered now using Presentation Pro to convert the PowerPoint file, is that once the conversion is complete, you can select to have the user view the module with their player option. This presents the user with the ability to see the presentation on one part of the screen, the audio script that was written in the Instructor Notes section, along with thumbnails of each slide in the presentation. Users have commented that this helps with following the audio portion, since they can now read the script for the audio while the audio is playing, or refer to the script after the audio has finished.

Custom Animation
Now that the audio has been inserted in each slide, we can begin to add animation to each slide and time it to match the audio. To activate this feature, click on “Slide Show” and then select, “Custom Animation”. This will open a menu on the right hand side of the slides (reference Figure 6 below). 

I recommend that you review the audio script in the Instructor notes and consider what type of animation that would accentuate your presentation. For example, you may want to introduce arrows, circles, or “Autoshapes” to reference particular areas of the slide. As you create and insert each figure, you would then click on the “Add Effect” &amp; then “Entrance” options in the Custom Animation menu and determine how you want the graphic to be animated when being introduced to the slide. You have a variety of options to chose from. Most of the time we use the “Appear” or “Dissolve In” command. (Note: be careful about getting carried away with the options, since it can become distracting to the user).

Once you have selected the graphic and how you want it animated into the slide, it will place this in a list in the Custom Animation menu. You should note that your audio file is already in this list if you selected the play automatically option when inserting the audio file. 

Figure 6.
On the right hand side is the Custom Animation menu. In the example above, we are simulating an application which includes several screen shots layered over each other. In addition we use various graphic symbols (boxes, arrows, circles) to reference specific areas on each slide. The format that works most effectively is to create the graphic symbol, and then add it to the Custom Animation list by selecting the Add Effect button and then selecting the method in which it will be introduced (e.g. Appear or Dissolve In, etc.). We will then want to erase the symbol when we want to reference another area in the slide. To do this we select the graphic symbol, click on Add Effect and then Exit to determine how you want the image to leave the presentation (e.g. Dissolve Out, Checkerboard, etc.).  


Note: in most cases I suggest immediately following the above step by also creating an exit animation. This will allow you to erase the image at a designated time in the presentation. Performing this step immediately after selecting the Entrance option is important particularly when you are adding layers to a slide (e.g. pictures over other pictures). It becomes more difficult to select the individual objects after they have been layered. Also, it is strongly recommended to write down a name for each figure you are animating along with the name given to that animation sequence. For example, for animating a rectangle, you would write down, “rectangle over defect”, and, “Rectangle 3” which is the name given to this animation in the custom animation list. This allows you to track your animations. You will also use this list to write down the appropriate time to start the animation as well as erase it. 

You may also want to introduce other objects such as callout boxes or other text boxes and animate them as well. You can also animate existing text in the slide such as title slides or bulleted lists. A nice feature is that you can time each bullet and its associate text from a bulleted list. To do this, click on the bulleted list and then add this to the Custom Animation list using the same instructions as above. Once inserted you will notice that the Text Box has a name &amp; number, along with a double downward facing arrow below this name. If you click on the downward facing arrow, it will list each bullet. This allows you to time each bullet just as you would all other animations. 

Once all of your figures and animations have been introduced, you need to time the entrance and exit for each animation in your list. Here is where your list you created, identifying each image you inserted into your animation sequence including the description and name given in the Custom Animation list, will come in handy. The first step is to click on any item in your Custom Animation list, then click on the downward facing arrow and select, “Show Advanced Timeline”. This will place a Seconds counter at the bottom of this list. 

Begin by clicking on the Play button at the bottom of the Custom Animation list. Your goal here is to write down on your list the time according to the Seconds counter when each image should be introduced. It may take a couple of plays to get all of the times written down. Once you have these times (do not worry if they are not exact at this point), you will begin establishing these times for each animation object. 

To do this click on the object in the Custom Animation list. Then click on the downward facing arrow for that object. You will first want to select the option, “Start With Previous” (there are several ways to place your objects into a sequence, this is just the way we found works for us). This is the method that automatically introduces objects vs. being introduced via a mouse click. With the timeline present, you will then click and drag the timing icon (represented by a blue rectangle in most cases) to the appropriate start time. As you drag the icon it will show you the exact time. You will notice that the seconds in the Seconds timeline will advance as you drag the icon to the right. 

Repeat this for each object in sequence. Note, you will want to be sure to erase the previous item prior to, or at the same time that your next object appears, if you want the previous object to disappear. After you have all of your items timed, click on the Play button once again. Note those items that are out of sequence or need timing adjustments. Make these adjustments and repeat until you get it correct. 

This will take some practice to get the hang of it. The challenge we discovered is when we forgot to create a graphic such as an arrow after we have placed all of the images over each other. In this case you will have to move all of the layers of images until you locate the one that you want to add the graphic to. The other suggestion is that you always create an exit for an image and graphic in the custom animation sequence. This removes the graphic or image so that you do not have to worry about the order of the images. Simply making a list of all the animation activity and names of each animation helps tremendously.

Saving Formats

As mentioned previously, we save all of the final presentations as a PowerPoint Show (.pps). This will automatically start the show when the user clicks on the link to access the module. 

Your next question is to determine how you will access these modules. We started our on-line initiative by placing links to the .pps files on our Intranet. This was a great way to launch this capability with minimal expense. Your IT or MIS department can help you here. Another option is to save the presentation on a CD. To do this within PowerPoint select the “Pack and Go” option in the File menu. You will be guided step-by-step how to do this. Once the file is created, save it in a separate folder. You will need to have a CD burner and software to place the Pack and Go file onto the CD. These are both quite inexpensive today.

If using the CD option, I would suggest creating your own labels for the CD. This helps to create a professional image. Many of the CD label packages have their own software included. We use the NEATO brand which included an easy to use CD labeling application. We added our logo, selected a design and added the text which was the name of the module and date or revision of the module. You can also purchase the inserts if you are placing the CD in a plastic case. On the front of the insert was the name of the module and any other information or logos you want to add. On the back was the instructions to launch the module. 

You can also download the PowerPoint player which is used to place on the CD so that users can view the module even if they do not have PowerPoint installed on their computer. The player is available on Microsoft’s web site. Most recently we experimented with Presentation Pro which converts the presentation into a flash file. You can download a trial version of this application. Presentation Pro will only accept certain video formats, which include .avi and .wmv, so we were set to go.

=== Summary ===

There are advantages and disadvantages to whatever tool you use to create on-line learning. The advantage that I hoped to portray is that PowerPoint provides you with everything you need to develop on-line training. The learning curve is not that steep which is what I found with some other content development applications. The biggest advantage was the price, free! Another key advantage is that you can turn any subject matter expert into a basic instructional designer since most have at least a basic knowledge of PowerPoint or can get a basic knowledge rather quickly. Another advantage is that a lot of presentation material is already developed in PowerPoint, which can then be easily modified into an on-line module.

The key is getting started. You will need to learn some intermediate and advanced PowerPoint skills, which are not that difficult to learn and apply. The next step is jumping in and creating your first module. Expect frustration as you would encounter with any new skill. Start with a simple module that would not require a lot of animation. My best recommendation would be to start with a presentation that is currently used in one of your classes. Insert the instructor’s script in the instructor notes section, add some pictures, a few quiz slides and off you go! 

As you learn new skills please share these new ideas. I have placed a simple threaded discussion board on my web site, www.trainingonashoestring.com. This way we can all learn together.

      <comment>/* The Great Depression */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Rise of Militarism in Japan was to have important repercussions in the future history of Japan. It led onto it's involvement in the Second World War.

==Causes==
The root of militarism can be seen in several reasons: Japan's relatively small gains in the Russo-Japanese War and WWI, The seemingly easy wins of the wars of this period and finally of the Wall Street Crash.

===The Great Depression===
The great depression affected Japan greatly, and led to a rise in militarism. As Japan exported luxury goods, such as silks, to other countries such as America, which because they were now affected by the depression could not afford them anymore. This led to a feeling in Japan that they should become more self-sufficient, through gaining of more territory. This meant Japan wanted to expand to gain more natural resources and to create its own economic empire in the Pacific. This feeling was also fuelled by the increasing overpopulation of Japan.

==The Manchurian Incident==
The Manchurian Incident or the Mukden Incident, was an incident which led to the Japanese Invasion of Manchuria. They installed 'Henry' Puyi (Last Emperor of China) as their puppet ruler. The Litton commission declared this to be illegal, so Japan left the League of Nations in protest. Japan was not punished, and other powers such as Germany and Italy took this as an example when they began to expand. This incident also led onto the Second Sino-Japanese War.

===Opening incident===
Japanese troops destroy a section of the south Manchurian railway, near Mukden, where there was a Japanese garrison. The troops blamed the incident on the Chinese and so they captured Mukden. They then went on top capture the rest of Manchuria.

==Second Sino-Japanese War==
In 1937, the Japanese attacked Beijing in the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. this date is the start of the Sino-Japanese War, however China and Japan had been fighting an undeclared war since the Mukden Incident, when Japan invaded Manchuria. This war became a part of the greater, Second World War in 1941.

===The Mukden Incident===
Japanese Troops stationed on the South Manchurian Railway destroy a section of the track. They claimed that this is the work of Chinese troops. The Japanese then seized Mukden, then the rest of Manchuria. The Japanese then established a puppet state in Manchuria.

===The Marco Polo Bridge Incident===
This war ended in 1945.

==Soviet–Japanese Border Wars==
These were a series of engagements on the northern border of China and Mongolia, near the river of Khalkhyn Gol. These resulted in a complete victory for the Soviet Union. Such defeats, inflicted on Japan by the USSR, created a sentiment in Japan that Germany and Japan could not link up through the territory of the Soviet Union.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Meiji tenno1.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Meiji]]
The Meiji period, also known as the Meiji era (明治時代 Meiji Jidai), is a Japanese era which extended from 1868 until 1912. This period represents the first half of the Empire of Japan. This era saw the industrialisation of Japan, and it's swift rise to the world stage. It saw a change in the culture of Japan, which adopted more western ideas. The Meiji era is the first era of Japanese history to see the rule of an emperor, since the Kenmu Restoration.

==Politics==
A major proponent of representative government was Itagaki Taisuke (1837–1919), a powerful Tosa leader who had resigned from the Council of State over the Korean affair in 1873. Itagaki sought peaceful rather than rebellious means to gain a voice in government. He started a school and a movement aimed at establishing a constitutional monarchy and a legislative assembly. Such movements were called The Freedom and People's Rights Movement. Itagaki and others wrote the Tosa Memorial in 1874 criticizing the unbridled power of the oligarchy and calling for the immediate establishment of representative government.

Between 1871 and 1873, a series of land and tax laws were enacted as the basis for modern fiscal policy. Private ownership was legalized, deeds were issued, and lands were assessed at fair market value with taxes paid in cash rather than in kind as in pre-Meiji days and at slightly lower rates.

Dissatisfied with the pace of reform after having rejoined the Council of State in 1875, Itagaki organized his followers and other democratic proponents into the nationwide Aikokusha (Society of Patriots) to push for representative government in 1878. In 1881, in an action for which he is best known, Itagaki helped found the Jiyuto (Liberal Party), which favored French political doctrines.
In 1882 Okuma Shigenobu established the Rikken Kaishintō (Constitutional Progressive Party), which called for a British-style constitutional democracy. In response, government bureaucrats, local government officials, and other conservatives established the Rikken Teiseitō (Imperial Rule Party), a pro-government party, in 1882. Numerous political demonstrations followed, some of them violent, resulting in further government restrictions. The restrictions hindered the political parties and led to divisions within and among them. The Jiyuto, which had opposed the Kaishinto, was disbanded in 1884, and Okuma resigned as Kaishinto president.
Government leaders, long preoccupied with violent threats to stability and the serious leadership split over the Korean affair, generally agreed that constitutional government should someday be established. The Chōshū leader Kido Takayoshi had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874, and several proposals for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. The oligarchy, however, while acknowledging the realities of political pressure, was determined to keep control. Thus, modest steps were taken.

The Osaka Conference in 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed Chamber of Elders (Genrōin) tasked with reviewing proposals for a legislature. The emperor declared that &quot;constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages&quot; as he ordered the Council of Elders to draft a constitution.

Three years later, the Conference of Prefectural Governors established elected prefectural assemblies. Although limited in their authority, these assemblies represented a move in the direction of representative government at the national level, and by 1880 assemblies also had been formed in villages and towns. In 1880 delegates from twenty-four prefectures held a national convention to establish the Kokkai Kisei Domei (League for Establishing a National Assembly).

Although the government was not opposed to parliamentary rule, confronted with the drive for &quot;people's rights,&quot; it continued to try to control the political situation. New laws in 1875 prohibited press criticism of the government or discussion of national laws. The Public Assembly Law (1880) severely limited public gatherings by disallowing attendance by civil servants and requiring police permission for all meetings.

Within the ruling circle, however, and despite the conservative approach of the leadership, Okuma continued as a lone advocate of British-style government, a government with political parties and a cabinet organized by the majority party, answerable to the national assembly. He called for elections to be held by 1882 and for a national assembly to be convened by 1883; in doing so, he precipitated a political crisis that ended with an 1881 imperial rescript declaring the establishment of a national assembly in 1890 and dismissing Okuma.

Rejecting the British model, Iwakura and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the Prussian constitutional system. One of the Meiji oligarchy, Ito Hirobumi (1841–1909), a Chōshū native long involved in government affairs, was charged with drafting Japan's constitution. He led a Constitutional Study Mission abroad in 1882, spending most of his time in Germany. He rejected the United States Constitution as &quot;too liberal&quot; and the British system as too unwieldy and having a parliament with too much control over the monarchy; the French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism.

Ito was put in charge of the new Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems in 1884, and the Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by Ito as prime minister. The positions of chancellor, minister of the left, and minister of the right, which had existed since the 7th century as advisory positions to the emperor, were all abolished. In their place, the Privy Council was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution and to advise the emperor.

To further strengthen the authority of the state, the Supreme War Council was established under the leadership of Yamagata Aritomo (1838–1922), a Chōshū native who has been credited with the founding of the modern Japanese army and was to become the first constitutional prime minister. The Supreme War Council developed a German-style general staff system with a chief of staff who had direct access to the emperor and who could operate independently of the army minister and civilian officials.

When finally granted by the emperor as a sign of his sharing his authority and giving rights and liberties to his subjects, the 1889 Constitution of the Empire of Japan (the Meiji Constitution) provided for the Imperial Diet (Teikoku Gikai), composed of a popularly elected House of Representatives with a very limited franchise of male citizens who were over 25 years of age and paid 15 yen in national taxes, about 1 % of the population, and the House of Peers, composed of nobility and imperial appointees; and a cabinet responsible to the emperor and independent of the legislature. The Diet could approve government legislation and initiate laws, make representations to the government, and submit petitions to the emperor. Nevertheless, in spite of these institutional changes, sovereignty still resided in the emperor on the basis of his divine ancestry.

The new constitution specified a form of government that was still authoritarian in character, with the emperor holding the ultimate power and only minimal concessions made to popular rights and parliamentary mechanisms. Party participation was recognized as part of the political process. The Meiji Constitution was to last as the fundamental law until 1947.

In the early years of constitutional government, the strengths and weaknesses of the Meiji Constitution were revealed. A small clique of Satsuma and Chōshū elite continued to rule Japan, becoming institutionalized as an extra-constitutional body of genro (elder statesmen). Collectively, the genro made decisions reserved for the emperor, and the genro, not the emperor, controlled the government politically.

Throughout the period, however, political problems were usually solved through compromise, and political parties gradually increased their power over the government and held an ever larger role in the political process as a result. Between 1891 and 1895, Ito served as prime minister with a cabinet composed mostly of genro who wanted to establish a government party to control the House of Representatives. Although not fully realized, the trend toward party politics was well established.

==Society==
On its return, one of the first acts of the government was to establish new ranks for the nobility. Five hundred people from the old court nobility, former daimyo, and samurai who had provided valuable service to the emperor were organized in five ranks: prince, marquis, count, viscount, and baron.
It was at this time that the Ee ja nai ka movement, a spontaneous outbreak of ecstatic behaviour, took place.
In 1885, the intellectual Yukichi Fukuzawa wrote the influential essay Leaving Asia, arguing that Japan should orient itself at the &quot;civilized countries of the West&quot;, leaving behind the &quot;hopelessly backward&quot; Asian neighbors, namely Korea and China. This essay certainly contributed to the economic and technological rise of Japan in the Meiji period but it may also have laid the foundations for later Japanese colonialism in the region.

==Economy==
The Industrial Revolution in Japan occurred during Meiji period. There were at least two reasons for the speed of Japan's modernization: the employment of over 3,000 foreign experts (called o-yatoi gaikokujin or 'hired foreigners') in a variety of specialist fields such as teaching English, science, engineering, the army and navy etc.; and the dispatch of many Japanese students overseas to Europe and America, based on the fifth and last article of the Charter Oath of 1868: 'Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of Imperial rule.' This process of modernization was closely monitored and heavily subsidized by the Meiji government, enhancing the power of the great zaibatsu firms such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi.

Hand in hand, the zaibatsu and government guided the nation, borrowing technology from the West. Japan gradually took control of much of Asia's market for manufactured goods, beginning with textiles. The economic structure became very mercantilistic, importing raw materials and exporting finished products — a reflection of Japan's relative poverty in raw materials.
Japan emerged from the Tokugawa-Tennō (Keiō-Meiji) transition in 1868 as the first Asian industrialized nation. Domestic commercial activities and limited foreign trade had met the demands for material culture until the Keiō period, but the modernized Meiji period had radically different requirements. From the onset, the Meiji rulers embraced the concept of a market economy and adopted British and North American forms of free enterprise capitalism. The private sector — in a nation with an abundance of aggressive entrepreneurs — welcomed such change.

Economic reforms included a unified modern currency based on the yen, banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. Establishment of a modern institutional framework conducive to an advanced capitalist economy took time but was completed by the 1890s. By this time, the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons.

Many of the former daimyo, whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries. Those who had been informally involved in foreign trade before the Meiji Restoration also flourished. Old bakufu-serving firms that clung to their traditional ways failed in the new business environment.

The government was initially involved in economic modernization, providing a number of &quot;model factories&quot; to facilitate the transition to the modern period. After the first twenty years of the Meiji period, the industrial economy expanded rapidly until about 1920 with inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments. Stimulated by wars and through cautious economic planning, Japan emerged from World War I as a major industrial nation.
==Military==
===Overview===
Undeterred by opposition, the Meiji leaders continued to modernize the nation through government-sponsored telegraph cable links to all major Japanese cities and the Asian mainland and construction of railroads, shipyards, munitions factories, mines, textile manufacturing facilities, factories, and experimental agriculture stations. Greatly concerned about national security, the leaders made significant efforts at military modernization, which included establishing a small standing army, a large reserve system, and compulsory militia service for all men. Foreign military systems were studied, foreign advisers, especially French ones, were brought in, and Japanese cadets sent abroad to Europe and the United States to attend military and naval schools.
===Early Meiji period 1868-1877===

In 1854, after Admiral Matthew C. Perry forced the signing of the Treaty of Kanagawa, Japan began to realize it must modernize its military to prevent further intimidation from western powers (Gordon, 2000). However, the Tokugawa shogunate did not officially share this point of view as evidenced by the imprisonment of the Governor of Nagasaki, Shanan Takushima for voicing his views of military reform and weapons modernization (GlobalSecurity.org, 2008).

It wasn't until the beginning of the Meiji Era in 1868 that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. In 1868, the Japanese government established the Tokyo Arsenal. This arsenal was responsible for the development and manufacture of small arms and associated ammunition (GlobalSecurity.org, 2008). The same year, Masujiro Omura established Japan's first ever military academy in Kyoto. Omura further proposed military billets be filled by all classes of people including farmers and merchants. The shogun class, not happy with Omura’s views on conscription, assassinated him the following year (Shinsengumihq.com, n.d.).
In 1870, Japan expanded its military production base by opening another arsenal in Osaka. The Osaka Arsenal was responsible for the production of machine guns and ammunition (National Diet Library, 2008). Also, four gunpowder facilities were also opened at this site. Japan's production capacity gradually improved.

In 1872, Yamagata Aritomo and Saigo Tsugumichi, both new field marshals, founded the Corps of the Imperial Guards. This corps was composed of the warrior classes from the Tosa, Satsuma, and Chusho clans (GlobalSecurity.org, 2008). Also, in the same year, the hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years, when in January the Conscription Law of 1873 was passed. This law required every able bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves (GlobalSecurity.org, 2008). This monumental law, signifying the beginning of the end for the samurai class, initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki (blood tax) literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. Avoidance methods included maiming, self-mutilation, and local uprisings (Kublin, 1949, p 32). The samurai were generally resentful of the new, western-style military and at first, refused to stand in formation with the lowly peasant class (GlobalSecurity.org, 2008).

In conjunction with the new conscription law, the Japanese government began modeling their ground forces after the French military. Indeed, the new Japanese army utilized the same rank structure as the French (Kublin, 1949, p 31). The enlisted corps ranks were: private, noncommissioned officers, and officers. The private classes were: joto-hei or upper soldier, itto-sottsu or first-class soldier, and nito-sotsu or second-class soldier. The noncommissioned officer class ranks were: gocho or corporal, gunso or sergeant, socho or sergeant major, and tokumu-socho or special sergeant major. Finally, the officer class is made up of: shoi or second lieutenant, chui or first lieutenant, tai or captain, shosa or major, chusa or lieutenant colonel, taisa or colonel, shosho or major general, chujo or lieutenant general, taisho or general, and gensui or field marshal (GlobalSecurity.org, 2008). The French government also contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks (GlobalSecuirty.org, 2008).

Despite the Conscription Law of 1873, and all the reforms and progress, the new Japanese army was still untested. That all changed in 1877, when Takamori Saigo, led the last rebellion of the samurai in Kyushu (GlobalSecurity.org, 2008). In February 1877, Saigo left Kagoshima with a small contingent of soldiers on a journey to Tokyo. Kumamoto castle was the site of the first major engagement as garrisoned forces fired on Saigo’s army as they attempted to force their way into the castle (Rickman, 2003, p 46). Rather than leave an enemy behind him, Saigo laid siege to the castle. Two days later, Saigo’s rebels, while attempting to block a mountain pass encountered advanced elements of the national army enroute to reinforce Kumamoto castle. After a short battle, both sides withdrew to reconstitute their forces (p 46). A few weeks later the national army engaged Saigo’s rebels in a frontal assault at what is now called the Battle of Tabaruzuka (p 47). During this eight day battle, Saigo’s nearly ten thousand strong army battled hand-to-hand the equally matched national army. Both sides suffered nearly four thousand casualties during this engagement (p 47). Due to conscription however, the Japanese army was able to reconstitute its forces while Saigo’s was not. Later, forces loyal to the Emperor broke through rebel lines and managed to end the siege on Kumamoto castle after fifty-four days (p 47). Saigo’s troops fled north, pursued by the national army. The national army caught up with Saigo at Mt. Enodake. Saigo’s army was outnumbered seven to one prompting a mass surrender of many samurai (p 48). The remaining five hundred samurai loyal to Saigo escaped, travelling south to Kagoshima. The rebellion ended on September 24, 1877 following the final engagement with Imperial forces which resulted in deaths of the remaining forty samurai and Takamori Saigo himself, who, having suffered a fatal bullet wound in the abdomen, was honourably beheaded by his retainer (p 49). The army’s victory validated the current course of the modernization of the Japanese army as well as ended the era of the samurai.

===Foreign relations===
When United States Navy ended Japan's sakoku policy, and thus its isolation, the latter found itself defenseless against military pressures and economic exploitation by the Western powers. For Japan to emerge from the feudal period, it had to avoid the colonial fate of other Asian countries by establishing genuine national independence and equality.

Following her defeat of China in Korea in the Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), Japan broke through as an international power with a victory against Russia in Manchuria (north-eastern China) in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Allied with Britain since the Anglo-Japanese Alliance signed in London on January 30, 1902, Japan joined the Allies in World War I, seizing German-held territory in China and the Pacific in the process, but otherwise remained largely out of the conflict.

After the war, a weakened Europe left a greater share in international markets for Japan, which emerged greatly strengthened. Japanese competition made great inroads into hitherto European-dominated markets in Asia, not only in China, but even in European colonies like India and Indonesia, reflecting the development of the Meiji era.

==Wars==
===First Sino-Japanese War===
The first Sino-Japanese War was waged from 1895-1896. Japan and China fought over Korea. Japan won, and China gave up Korea, Taiwan, and Lushun (also known as Port Arthur) in the Treaty of Shimonoseki.

After the war, Russia, Germany, and France stepped in and pressured Japan to return Lushun to China. China then leased Lushun to Russia for cheap.

===Russo-Japanese War===
[[Image:Fire of the Oil Depot Caused by Our Gunfire.jpg|right|thumb|Bombardment during the Siege of Port Arthur.]]
The Russo–Japanese War( 日露戦争, Nichi-Ro Sensō) was waged from the 10th February 1904 to the 5th September 1905. The significance of this war is that it was Japan's first war with a European power. The Result was Japan won. This had far reaching consequences in world history. It proved to many Russian revolutionaries that the Tsarist government was weak and so needed to be overthrown. The tactics of the war would introduce the generals of the first world war. In a campaign where Japan was constantly on the offensive, although they suffered massive losses, they still managed to catch much territory. This proved that if morale was high among troops even the strongest of defences could be overcome. In Japan it was a reason for to the rise of militarism as it proved Japan could beat a major world power. Another reason for the rise of militarism was the fact that Japan felt it had not gained enough territory from the peace agreements.

====Declaration of War====
The War began with the Battle of Port Arthur, when the Japanese navy, under the command of Admiral Togo Heihachiro, attacked Russian ships at Port Arthur(Modern Day Lüshun), without a declaration of war. It was Japan's first real battle with Europeans, and convinced them that a surprise attack without a declaration of war was the best style of attack.

====The Siege of Port Arthur====


====Defeat of Russia====
The Russian Pacific fleet was holed up in Port Arthur so the Russians decided to reinforce their fleet with their Baltic fleet. They sent round their fleet to the Pacific however as it passed Tsushima the fleet was decisively defeated by the Japanese Navy.

====Aftermath====
The Russians were defeated, causing Japanese might to be recognized by the international community. However, this put an already financially sapped Japan into even greater debt.

==Japanese Preparations for War==
In an effort to discourage Japanese militarism, Western powers including Australia, the United States, Britain, and the Dutch government in exile, which controlled the petroleum-rich Netherlands East Indies, stopped selling iron ore, steel and oil to Japan, denying it the raw materials needed to continue its aggressive activities in China and French Indochina. In Japan, the government and nationalists viewed these embargos as acts of aggression; imported oil made up about 80% of domestic consumption, without which Japan's economy, let alone its military, would grind to a halt. The Japanese media, influenced by military propagandists, began to refer to the embargoes as the &quot;ABCD (&quot;American-British-Chinese-Dutch&quot;) encirclement&quot; or &quot;ABCD line&quot;.

Faced with a choice between economic collapse and withdrawal from its recent conquests (with its attendant loss of face), the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters began planning for a war with the western powers in April or May 1941.

The key objective was for the Southern Expeditionary Army Group to seize economic resources under the control of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, most notably those in Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies, known as the &quot;Southern Plan&quot;. It was also decided—because of the close relationship between the UK and United States, and the (mistaken) belief the US would inevitably become involved—Japan would also require an &quot;eastern plan&quot;.

The eastern plan required
* initial attacks on the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, with carrier-based aircraft of the Combined Fleet, and
* following this attack with
** seizure of the Philippines, and
** cutting the U.S. lines of communication by seizing Guam and Wake Island.

The southern plans called for:
* attacking Malaya and Hong Kong, and
* following with attacks against
** the Bismarck Archipelago,
** Java, and
** Sumatra.
* isolating Australia and New Zealand

Following completion of these objectives, the strategy would turn defensive, primarily holding their newly acquired territory while hoping for a negotiated peace.

By November these plans were essentially complete, and were modified only slightly over the next month. Japanese military planners' expectation of success rested on the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union being unable to effectively respond to a Japanese attack because of the threat posed to each by Germany; the Soviet Union was even seen as unlikely to commence hostilities.
There is no evidence the Japanese planned to defeat the United States; the alternative would be negotiating for peace after their initial victories. In fact, the Imperial GHQ noted, should acceptable negotiations be reached with the Americans, the attacks were to be canceled—even if the order to attack had already been given.

They also planned, should the U.S. transfer its Pacific Fleet to the Philippines, to intercept and attack this fleet en route with the Combined Fleet, in keeping with all Japanese Navy prewar planning and doctrine.

Should the United States or Britain attack first, the plans further stipulated the military were to hold their positions and wait for orders from GHQ. The planners noted attacking the Philippines and Malaya still had possibilities of success, even in the worst case of a combined preemptive attack including Soviet forces.

==Declaration of War==
[[Image:USS Arizona sinking 2a.jpg|right|thumb|USS Arizona sinking during the attack.]]
On the 22 June 1941 the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany invaded Soviet Russia in &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;. The Japanese had also signed a neutrality pact with the Soviet Union, and there was little chance that the Soviets would attack Japan (although the Soviets later broke the pact) This freed the Japanese Armed Forces to expand southwards.

On the 7th of December 1941, The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour. Their Mission to destroy the American Pacific Fleet. The idea was to emulate the Japanese attack on Port Arthur. They succeeded in sinking many American battleships however, crucially they failed to destroy the repair houses and the carriers of The American Pacific Fleet. This meant much of the American fleet was back in action relatively quickly. The carriers were much more decisive a weapon in the war as a whole, eventually rendering battleships obsolete. This can be seen with the mega-battle ships of the Japanese. These ships had massive guns, however they were destroyed by planes, mainly launched from carriers. Finally many of the battleships of Pearl Harbour were to be scuttled, and the Japanese attack may have just saved them from the scrapyards.

==Initial Japanese Successes ==
British, Australian and Dutch forces, already drained of personnel and material by two years of war with Germany, and heavily committed in the Middle East, North Africa and elsewhere, were unable to provide much more than token resistance to the battle-hardened Japanese. The Allies suffered many disastrous defeats in the first six months of the war. Two major British warships, HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales were sunk by a Japanese air attack off Malaya on 10 December 1941.

Thailand, with its territory already serving as a springboard for the Malayan campaign, surrendered within 24 hours of the Japanese invasion. The government of Thailand formally allied itself with Japan on 21 December.

Hong Kong was attacked on 8 December and fell on 25 December 1941, with Canadian forces and the Royal Hong Kong Volunteers playing an important part in the defense. U.S. bases on Guam and Wake Island were lost at around the same time.

Following the 1 January 1942 Declaration by United Nations (the first official use of the term United Nations), the Allied governments appointed the British General Sir Archibald Wavell to the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM), a supreme command for Allied forces in South East Asia. This gave Wavell nominal control of a huge force, albeit thinly-spread over an area from Burma to the Philippines to northern Australia. Other areas, including India, Hawaii and the rest of Australia remained under separate local commands. On 15 January Wavell moved to Bandung in Java to assume control of ABDA Command (ABDACOM).
In January, Japan invaded Burma, the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and captured Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Rabaul. After being driven out of Malaya, Allied forces in Singapore attempted to resist the Japanese during the Battle of Singapore but surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942; about 130,000 Indian, British, Australian and Dutch personnel became prisoners of war. The pace of Japanese conquest was rapid: Bali and Timor also fell in February. The rapid collapse of Allied resistance had left the &quot;ABDA area&quot; split in two. Wavell resigned from ABDACOM on 25 February, handing control of the ABDA Area to local commanders and returning to the post of Commander-in-Chief, India.

Meanwhile, Japanese aircraft had all but eliminated Allied air power in South-East Asia and were making attacks on northern Australia, beginning with a psychologically devastating (but militarily insignificant) attack on the city of Darwin on 19 February, which killed at least 243 people.

At the Battle of the Java Sea in late February and early March, the Japanese Navy inflicted a resounding defeat on the main ABDA naval force, under Admiral Karel Doorman. The Netherlands East Indies campaign subsequently ended with the surrender of Allied forces on Java.

In March and April, a raid into the Indian Ocean by a powerful Imperial Japanese Navy aircraft carrier force resulted in a wave of major air raids against Ceylon and the sinking of a British aircraft carrier, HMS Hermes as well as other Allied ships and driving the British fleet out of the Indian Ocean. This paved the way for a Japanese assault on Burma and India.

The British, under intense pressure, made a fighting retreat from Rangoon to the Indo-Burmese border. This cut the Burma Road which was the western Allies' supply line to the Chinese Nationalists. Cooperation between the Chinese Nationalists and the Communists had waned from its zenith at the Battle of Wuhan, and the relationship between the two had gone sour as both attempted to expand their area of operations in occupied territories. Most of the Nationalist guerrilla areas were eventually overtaken by the Communists. On the other hand, some Nationalist units were deployed to blockade the Communists and not the Japanese. Furthermore, many of the forces of the Chinese Nationalists were warlords allied to Chiang Kai-Shek, but not directly under his command. &quot;Of the 1,200,000 troops under Chiang's control, only 650,000 were directly controlled by his generals, and another 550,000 controlled by warlords who claimed loyalty to his government; the strongest force was the Szechuan army of 320,000 men. The defeat of this army would do much to end Chiang's power.&quot; The Japanese exploited this lack of unity to press ahead in their offensives.

Filipino and U.S. forces resisted in the Philippines until 8 May 1942, when more than 80,000 soldiers were ordered to surrender. By this time, General Douglas MacArthur, who had been appointed Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific, had retreated to the safer confines of Australia. The U.S. Navy, under Admiral Chester Nimitz, had responsibility for the rest of the Pacific Ocean. This divided command had unfortunate consequences for the commerce war, and consequently, the war itself.

==The Tide Turns==
===The Battle of the Coral Sea===
By mid-1942, the Japanese Combined Fleet found itself holding a vast area, even though it lacked the aircraft carriers, aircraft, and aircrew to defend it, and the freighters, tankers, and destroyers necessary to sustain it. Moreover, Fleet doctrine was inadequate to execute the proposed &quot;barrier&quot; defence. Instead, they decided on additional attacks in both the south and central Pacific. While Yamamoto had used the element of surprise at Pearl Harbor, Allied codebreakers now turned the tables. They discovered an attack against Port Moresby, New Guinea, was imminent with intent to invade and conquer all of New Guinea. If Port Moresby fell, it would give Japan control of the seas to the immediate north of Australia. Nimitz rushed the carrier USS Lexington, under Admiral Fletcher, to join USS Yorktown and an American-Australian task force, with orders to contest the Japanese advance. The resulting Battle of the Coral Sea was the first naval battle in which ships involved never sighted each other and aircraft were solely used to attack opposing forces. Although ''Lexington'' was sunk and ''Yorktown'' seriously damaged, the Japanese lost the aircraft carrier Shōhō, suffered extensive damage to the aircraft carrier Shōkaku and heavy losses to the air wing of warship Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku  (both missed the operation against Midway the following month), and saw the Moresby invasion force turn back. Even though Allied losses were heavier than Japanese, the Japanese attack on Port Moresby was thwarted and their invasion forces turned back, yielding a strategic victory for the Allies. Moreover, Japan lacked the capacity to replace losses in ships, planes and trained pilots.
Destruction of U.S. carriers was Yamamoto's main objective, and he planned an operation to lure them to battle. After Coral Sea, he had four fleet carriers operational—Sōryū, Kaga, Akagi and  Hiryū —and believed Nimitz had a maximum of two—USS Enterprise and USS Hornet. USS Saratoga CV-3 2 was out of action, undergoing repair after a torpedo attack, while ''Yorktown'' sailed after three days' work to repair her flight deck and make essential repairs, with civilian work crews still aboard.

===The Battle of Midway===
A large Japanese force was sent north to attack the Aleutian Islands, off Alaska. The next stage of Yamamoto's plan called for the capture of Midway Atoll, which would give him an opportunity to destroy Nimitz's remaining carriers; afterward, it would be turned into a major airbase, giving Japan control of the central Pacific. In May, Allied codebreakers discovered his intentions. Nagumo was again in tactical command but was focused on the invasion of Midway; Yamamoto's complex plan had no provision for intervention by Nimitz before the Japanese expected him. Planned surveillance of the U.S. fleet by long range seaplane did not happen (as a result of an abortive identical operation in March), so U.S. carriers were able to proceed to a flanking position on the approaching Japanese fleet without being detected. Nagumo had 272 planes operating from his four carriers, the U.S. 348 (of which 115 were land-based).

As anticipated by U.S. commanders, the Japanese fleet arrived off Midway on 4 June and was spotted by PBY patrol aircraft. Nagumo executed a first strike against Midway, while Fletcher launched his aircraft, bound for Nagumo's carriers. At 09:20 the first U.S carrier aircraft arrived, TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from ''Hornet'', but their attacks were poorly coordinated and ineffectual; they failed to score a single hit, and  Zero fighters shot down all 15. At 09:35, 15 TBDs from ''Enterprise'' skimmed in over the water; 14 were shot down by Zeroes. Fletcher's attacks had been disorganized, yet succeeded in distracting Nagumo's defensive fighters. When U.S. dive bombers arrived, the Zeros could not offer any protection. In addition, Nagumo's four carriers had drifted out of formation, reducing the concentration of their anti-aircraft fire. His most-criticized error was twice changing his arming orders: he first held aircraft for shipping attack as a hedge against discovery of U.S. carriers, changed this based on reports an additional strike was needed against Midway, then again after sighting ''Yorktown'', wasting time and leaving his hangar decks crowded with refueling and rearming aircraft, and ordnance stowed outside the magazines. Yamamoto's dispositions, which left Nagumo with inadequate reconnaissance to detect (and therefore attack) Fletcher before he launched, are often ignored.

When SBD Dauntlesses from ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' appeared at an altitude of 10,000 ft, the Zeroes at sea level were unable to respond before the bombers pushed over. They scored a small number of significant hits; ''Sōryū'', ''Kaga'', and ''Akagi'' all caught fire. ''Hiryū'' survived this wave of attacks and launched an attack against the American carriers which caused severe damage to ''Yorktown'' (which was later finished off by a Japanese submarine). A second attack from the U.S. carriers a few hours later found and destroyed ''Hiryū''. Yamamoto had four additional small carriers, assigned to his scattered surface forces, all too slow to keep up with the ''Kido Butai'' and therefore never in action. Yamamoto's enormous superiority in gun power was irrelevant as the U.S. had air superiority at Midway and could refuse a surface gunfight (which, by remarkable good fortune, Spruance moved to avoid, based on a faulty submarine report); Yamamoto's flawed dispositions had made closing to engage after dark on 4 June impossible. Midway was a decisive victory for the U.S. Navy and the end of the high point in Japanese aspirations in the Pacific. After merely a year the Japanese had reached their high point in the Pacific, but the process of recapturing the land the Japanese had quickly conquered, was to be no easy task.

===New Guinea and the Solomons===
Japanese land forces continued to advance in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. From July 1942, a few Australian reserve battalions, many of them very young and untrained, fought a stubborn rearguard action in New Guinea, against a Japanese advance along the Kokoda Track, towards Port Moresby, over the rugged Owen Stanley Ranges. The militia, worn out and severely depleted by casualties, were relieved in late August by regular troops from the Second Australian Imperial Force, returning from action in the Mediterranean theater.

US Marines rest in the field during the Guadalcanal campaign in November 1942
In early September 1942 Japanese marines attacked a strategic Royal Australian Air Force base at Milne Bay, near the eastern tip of New Guinea. They were beaten back by the Australian Army, which inflicted the first outright defeat on Japanese land forces since 1939.

===Guadalcanal===
At the same time as major battles raged in New Guinea, Allied forces identified a Japanese airfield under construction at Guadalcanal. In August 16,000 Allied infantry—primarily US Marines—made an amphibious landing, to capture the airfield.
Japanese and Allied forces occupied various parts of the island. Over the following six months, both sides fed resources into an escalating battle of attrition on the island, at sea, and in the sky. Most of the Japanese aircraft in the South Pacific were drafted into the Japanese defence of Guadalcanal, facing Allied air forces based at Henderson Field. Japanese ground forces launched attacks on US positions around Henderson Field, suffering high casualties. These offensives were resupplied by Japanese convoys known to the Allies as the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;, which often faced night battles with the Allied navies, and expended destroyers IJN could ill-afford to lose. Later fleet battles involving heavier ships and even daytime carrier battles resulted in a stretch of water near Guadalcanal becoming known as &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot;, from the severe losses to both sides. However, only the US Navy could quickly replace and repair its losses. The Allies were victorious on Guadalcanal in February 1943.

==End of World War II==
Emperor Hirohito surrendered on national radio six days after the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki. Japan surrendered due to the 2 Atomic bombs and due to the Soviet Declaration of War caused them to surrender, or at least contributed to it.

For fear that if Japan accepted Unconditional Surrender that the monarchy would be deposed, Japan had been attempting to get the USSR to mediate a peace deal between the USA and Japan. However the USSR delayed and decisions and had been discussing with the other allies a possible Soviet declaration of war against Japan. After defeating Germany many Soviet troops were moved to East Asia where they invaded Manchuria. This may have been a large reason for the surrender of Japan.

Many people wanted to keep fighting the war however the Showa emperor broadcast an order to surrender. Many holdouts have also been found, some as late as 1974. This shows the Japanese ideal that was around that the Japanese never surrender.

The war officially ended in 1951, with the Treaty of San Francisco, which was signed by 48 nations.

==Japan's Home Front==
===Rationing===
Strict rationing was imposed as Japan depended on many imports for its food. 

===Bombing of Japan===
The United States strategic bombing of Japan took place between 1942 and 1945. In the last seven months of the campaign, a change to firebombing tactics resulted in great destruction of 67 Japanese cities, as many as 500,000 Japanese deaths and some 5 million more made homeless. Emperor Hirohito's viewing of the destroyed areas of Tokyo in March 1945, is said to have been the beginning of his personal involvement in the peace process, culminating in Japan's surrender five months later.

===Problems===
Women were not utilised, and were not drafted into industry. Rather they were expected to have good families.

===Plan for a Last Defence===
Lack of weapons meant that people were issued with bamboo sticks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I date this period from the death of Kammu Tenno in 806 to the death of Fujiwara no Tokihira in 909. This is one of several possible end points, but it may be said to mark the end of the last attempt to restore life to the model of government and social organization inaugurated by Tenchi Tenno and Temmu Tenno in the Asuka period. The early Heian period was clearly a continuation of the Nara period in that the government remained committed throughout to make the &quot;ritsu-ryo&quot; system established by the law codes of 694 and 701 work. On the other hand, in contrast to the Nara period, the early Heian period was clearly a time when the efforts of the government were inadequate to counteract new developments that were pushing in a different direction entirely, one that would eventually lead to the feudal society of the medieval period.

The issues fall naturally into three categories. 

The first is the development and elaboration of what is known as the shoen system. Shoen refers to a legal category of estate that separated blocks of land from the &quot;public&quot; lands that were subject to the land redistribution system and the full range of taxes and made them &quot;private&quot; lands that were to some extent immune to taxation and to the interference of the provincial authorities. The original shoen were created by Shomu Tenno in the Nara period to finance his great Buddhist temple Todaiji. However, they only started to grow into an institution threatening the integrity of the system in the Heian period. By the end of the early Heian period shoen were on the verge of replacing the taxes from the public lands as the primary economic support of the ruling class in the capital. Taxes were still collected, but they mostly ceased to be available for budgeted expenditures of the government and flowed directly into the pockets of the governor and his subordinates as another form of essentially private income. 

The second main theme is the development of the regency system. During the course of the early Heian period the imperial clan lost control of the government to the Fujiwara clan for a substantial portion of time. The institutional marker of this was the development of the offices known as Sessho and Kampaku. Both may be translated as &quot;regent&quot;, one applied in the case when the emperor was a minor and the other in the case when the emperor was an adult, but the substance was identical. The regent had the authority to act without restraint in place of the emperor, to sign valid imperial edicts. The underlying mechanism was rooted in the marriage customs of the aristocratic class whereby wives continued to live in the house of their father and this was where their children were raised. The children came under the control of their father only when they became legally adult. The girls were usually moved into his house and his sons usually established houses of their own. This meant that a man had a much closer relationship with his father in law than with his natural father, and that a male child was essentially raised by his grandfather. The Fujiwara regent was in principle the grandfather of the emperor or, if the grandfather was dead, one of the emperor's uncles. Whenever it happened that an emperor came to the throne who was not a Fujiwara grandchild there was the possibility that Fujiwara dominance would be broken, and that eventually happened, but not in this period. 

The third main development, which only became apparent late in the period under consideration, was a transformation of life among the provincial nobility which led them to become much more independent of the capital nobility and politically active in their own right. One aspect of this was to have enormous importance, the militarization of this class, leading to the development of the social group later known as bushi or samurai. In the early Heian period the word samurai meant servant and it had no military connotation and did not refer to a person of elite status. Actually, the more common term was rodo, which meant the same thing. When provincial nobles started to form private armed forces, they did so by arming their dependents, some of whom were farmers and some of whom were servants, rodo. These rodo were housed and fed and equipped by their master and were of humble status, but they eventually evolved into the haughty samurai of later times. We have some very valuable sources on the early stages of this process thanks to the emergence of Japanese language fiction at the end of the 9th century. 

==Outline of Political History==

The political history of this period falls into three clear phases.

From 809 until the death of retired emperor Saga in 842 the sons of Kammu were in charge. Emperors Heizei and Saga were in complete charge of the government. Emperors Junna and Nimmyo were interested in other things and made no effort to challenge Saga. 

When Saga died in 842 Nimmyo Tenno turned control of the government over to Fujiwara Yoshifusa, who converted his dominance into a new institutional form, the &quot;regency&quot;. In 857 he took the title Dajodaijin, vacant since Dokyo, and in 866 invented a new title, Sessho, which is translated regent. When he died in 862 his power was maintained by his heir Mototsune. In 887 Mototsune invented a new title, Kampaku, to identify the regency when applied to an adult emperor. The regency temporarily lapsed when Mototsune died in 891.

The period from 891 to the end of this era was dominated by Uda Tenno who functioned as the ruler. He was able to refuse to appoint a new regent when Mototsune died, and also succeeded in transferring power to his son Daigo Tenno.

===The Sons of Kammu===

During his reign Kammu Tenno was unquestionably in complete charge of the government. He consistently left many sangi level offices vacant and throughout his reign maintained only one &quot;great minister&quot;, the Udaijin, held by a succession of members of the Fujiwara clan. There are sources which state that it was his intention to return to the ancient pattern for the succession which was a succession of generations. It was vital for the imperial clan to ensure that the ruler was an adult of ability, not a child, so when a ruler died who did not have an heir who was an adult, he was to be followed by a brother. There was another factor to this mode of succession because the status of a member of the clan was determined by the degree of his relationship to an emperor. If three brothers held the throne in succession then all of their sons would be of the highest status, ensuring a larger pool from which to make sure that the ruler was up to the task of keeping the clan on top. Of course, this also increased the possibility of conflicts over the succession.

When Kammu died his son prince Ate followed him and a second son prince Kamino was designated the official heir. These are Heizei Tenno and Saga Tenno respectively. Heizei was 33 at his accession, and the government immediately showed itself active, sending out circuit inspectors, with a particular mandate to look for cases where water from government irrigation systems was being diverted to open private farmland. Later the same year there was an edict directed to the management of temples, to ensure that people could not create a new temple and endow it with land (which became exempt from many taxes) but then continue to treat the land as their private property.

There were three branches of the Fujiwara clan active in court politics and they were very competetive. There had been four branches, of course, descended from the four sons of Fujiwara Fuhito, but the branch that led to Fujiwara Nakamaro had been eliminated from consideration. Prince Iyo, a brother of the emperor, was a grandson of Fujiwara Korekimi, who had been Udaijin from 783 to 789, and a nephew of Fujiwara Otomo, a member of the sangi. These men were of the &quot;shiki&quot; branch of the Fujiwara. The current Udaijin was Fujiwara Uchimaro of the &quot;northern&quot; branch. Prince Iyo was currently the administrator in charge of the imperial palace, a senior position. Fujiwara Otomo was the leader of the remaining &quot;southern&quot; branch and also a member of the sangi. 

According to the official history, Otomo informed Uchimaro that he had heard that another Fujiwara of the southern branch, Munenari, had secretly approached Prince Iyo and urged him to rebel. Prince Iyo became aware of this report and immediately went to the emperor and reported that Munenari had approached him. Munenari was arrested and he claimed that Prince Iyo was the instigator of the plot. Iyo and his mother (the daughter of Korekimi) were arrested and immediately committed suicide by taking poison. Munenari was exiled and Otomo was removed from office and exiled as well. This largely eliminated the southern branch of the Fujiwara from the competition. The speedy resolution of this incident shows that Heizei shared his father's aggressiveness in handling any hint of a threat.

Early in 809 Heizei announced his intention to abdicate in favor of his brother. His own son, prince Takaoka, was appointed crown prince. He claimed to be too ill to fulfill the obligations of his office. It is speculated that he feared that he might die in circumstances which would lead to the exclusion of his sons from the line of succession.

The retired emperor changed his residence 5 times in the next few months seeking relief from his illness (a not uncommon practice at the time, seeking what we would call &quot;good feng-shueh&quot;) without success. He then announced that he would move back to Nara, and without waiting for an official residence to be prepared he moved into a borrowed mansion in the old city at the end of the year. At about the same time Saga Tenno also became seriously ill and the court cancelled the usual new year ceremonies. This led Saga to revive the Kurodo office that had been used by Kammu so that he could work from his private suite, and it is from this time that it became a permanent institution. He recovered for a time but in the 7th and 8th months of 810 became seriously ill once more. 

On the 6th day of the 9th month the retired emperor issued an edict announcing the abolition of Heiankyo and the restoration of Nara as the capital. He also named two illustrious officials, Sakanoue Tamuramaro and Fujiwara Fuyutsugu, to serve as body guards to the emperor. This might be interpreted as a request to the two to take the emperor into &quot;protective custody,&quot; but little is certain about this episode. On the 10th day Saga Tenno overruled Heizei's edict and sent out officers to raise troops in nearby provinces. Heizei found out about this the next day and immediately made preparations to leave Nara for the east. Saga Tenno appointed Sakanoue Tamuramaro to take command of forces positioned to protect Kyoto. Heizei left Nara with a small party, but encountered troops and became frightened and returned to the city, where he shaved his head and took monastic orders. There was no actual fighting. Heizei and two officials who accompanied him were exiled. Heizei lived another 14 years. His son was removed from the succession in favor of another son of Kammu (future Junna Tenno). The future of the imperial clan belonged to the descendents of Saga via his son Nimmyo Tenno, successor to Junna. Saga took steps to eliminate Nara as a base from which to stage a takeover: he ordered the demolition of the city. However, an unofficial town just outside the official city centered on a cluster of important temples and shrines survived to become the modern city of Nara.

This incident has attracted a lot of attention, but there is really very little information about it. It is felt that Heizei Tenno was mentally unstable and impulsive and that he regretted abdicating and hoped to reclaim the throne before Saga could die and pass it on. As it happened Saga recovered his health and had a relatively long reign, abdicating in 823 and living until 842. He has the reputation of having taken his responsibilities seriously and generally continuing the policies of Kammu. He remained the effective ruler up to his death.

However, there are clear signs that there were problems. Saga conducted land redistibutions in 810 and 828 (technically Junna), failing to make Kammu's schedule of 12 years. It is also not clear from the evidence whether these redistributions covered the entire country. It is only known for sure that the provinces near the capital were done. After Saga's death, the Nimmyo court undertook the census required for a redistibution in 844, but the redistribution itself was never performed. There is no record of another attempt before 879. It is thought that all attempts to keep the registers were abandoned, because the redistributions were their only purpose. The local officials naturally knew where all the farm land was and where to go to collect taxes from it.

The end of the redistibution system did not mean the end of the involvement of the government in agriculture. The government noted that farmers of the Uda district of Yamato province invented wooden drying racks for sheaves of rice that dried the grain (so that it could be threshed) more quickly with less chance of rot setting in, and in 841 an edict recommended that all farmers take up the practice, still in use today. In 829 there was an edict urging the use of a type of waterwheel that had been invented in China to power pumps for irrigation. Amidst a series of years in which harvests were poor, the government exerted efforts to persuade farmers to vary their crops by adding buckwheat and three kinds of millet, kibi, kibinomochi and hiemugi. As in the 8th century the farmers seem to have ignored this advice. Only in feudal times did multiple cropping become widespread.

Saga Tenno supported the completion of a project that had been much discussed during Kammu's reign to put together an official compilation of materials that had the effect of amending the administrative codes. These fell into two categories, kyaku, which were administrative rulings, and shiki, which were legal judgements and interpretations of the law. A set of 10 volumes of kyaku and 40 volumes of shiki was completed in 820 and Saga ordered that copies be made and distributed throughout the government, a process that took 10 years to complete. They include documents created from the time of Konin Tenno forward. Fujiwara Fuyutsugu had a collection of Saga's edicts created in 821 and in 833 a group of scholars produced a very important book in &lt;i&gt;Ryo no Gige&lt;/i&gt; (10 volumes) intended to provide a summary of all of the rulings that were considered to be currently in force. It was also during this period that copies of the Yoro code of 718 were made which are the only reason that large parts of it survive. Also, the &quot;national histories&quot; were continued. In 819 Saga ordered preparation of a continuation of &lt;i&gt;Shoku Nihongi&lt;/i&gt;. However, the project apparently got sidetracked when Fujiwara Otsugu died, but it was revived later and completed in 840. This is &lt;i&gt;Nihon Koki&lt;/i&gt; and it covers the period from 792 to 833 in 40 volumes. Unfortunately, only 10 volumes survive. Most of Kammu's reign is lost.

Another innovation of Saga's time was the establishment of the office of Kebiishi. The government kept guard units in the capital. There were six of them with a nominal total strength of 2,400 men. They were organized as military units and also provided security for the palace and official buildings. They probably also managed the city gates. The Kebiishi on the other hand amounted to a civilian police force for the city, showing that it had become densely enough populated to need one. They were conspicuously successful in keeping order when the city was seriously flooded in 837 and in 839 were given control of all police related functions that were, under the code, spread among a number of small offices. By 850 they were also running a prison system and in 857 two executioners were added. Also Kebiishi began to be posted to rural areas around that time. Kyoto was from the 830's at least overrun with professional criminals and the Kebiishi were only moderately successful in suppressing them. In 837 the emperor came across two female robbers stealing clothing in the palace who pulled knives on him.

Saga Tenno was 38 when he abdicated. Fujiwara Fuyutsugu, the chief minister at the time, objected on the grounds that the government could not afford two palaces and two emperors, but Saga insisted. He continued to run things and there is no evidence that Junna Tenno, who was mild-mannered and scholarly, objected to this. Junna abdicated as soon as Saga's son Masayoshi was old enough to become emperor, and his own son Tsunesada was in turn designated the crown prince. Fuyutsugu was right to be worried, it seems, as Saga and Junna (and Nimmyo later) were fond of high living and were noted for giving frequent and expensive parties.

Saga Tenno lived a long time and had many wives. The result was approximately 50 children. Because there were so many of them, he took a group with low status mothers and set them up as a new clan, Minamoto. Several later rulers followed this precedent, leading to several different groups of Minamotos (and Tairas, another clan name used the same way). The group descended from Saga are in later times known as &quot;the Saga Genji.&quot; Genji is &quot;Minamoto clan&quot; if pronounced as Chinese. Several of the Saga Genji had prominent political careers from the reign of Nimmyo Tenno forward. They were moved into high status jobs at very early ages. Minamoto Tokiwa was made Udaijin at the age of 29 whereas the Sadaijin at the time was Fujiwara Otsugu, aged 69. Fujiwara Yoshifusa, the future dictator, was merely Chunagon at age 37 at the time. 

During the reigns of Kammu and Heizei men appointed to high office had lengthy experience of low ones that would have exposed them to the lives of the ordinary population, usually including service as an active military officer in the field or as provincial governor. One of the sangi at this time, Ono Minemori, is known to have worked at Dazaifu where he was active in setting up a chain of hostels that could be used by corvee laborers while travelling. He also worked on an experimental system of kueiden in Kyushu. This was a project to find out whether it was feasible for the government to take direct command of farming activity. The government designated a special block of land and peasants to farm it. The government then fed the workers and paid all of their expenses directly, collected the entire crop, paid the workers' taxes and the expenses out of it and kept what was left as profit. The goal was to split the wealth between the peasants and the government and freeze out the local aristocracy, who usually creamed off most of the profit. The foremen who controlled the work were also peasants, paid extra. The project was considered a success, though it was not followed up. A man like Ono Minemori would have had a pretty good idea what the real world was like by the time he rose to high office. That would not necessarily be the case for a man like Minamoto Tokiwa who stepped directly from a youth in the palace to appointment as a senior minister.

The year 842 marks a major transition, the death of the retired emperor Saga, who had dominated the government since his accession to the throne in 809. Junnin had died two years earlier and Nimmyo Tenno was now on his own. He was clearly not up to it, and power almost immediately shifted into the hands of Fujiwara Yoshifusa. He was a high ranking official but by no means the highest, but he quickly demonstrated high class conspiratorial skills, and then maintained his control without much effort for many years. Clearly, he knew what he was doing.


===The first Fujiwara Regency===


Eight days after the death of Saga Nimmyo arrested Tsunesada and deposed him. A large number of officials were demoted and others were promoted to replace them, headed by Fujiwara Yoshifusa. One month later Nimmyo Tenno's son prince Michiyasu was designated crown prince. The most unusual thing about this episode is that Tsunesada was not killed. Like Heizei Tenno he was allowed to live out his life. It is worthy of noting that both princes involved, Tsunesada and Michiyasu, had Fujiwara mothers. However, Tsunesada's mother was of a branch that was rival to Yoshifusa. Michiyasu's mother was Yoshifusa's sister.

Yoshifusa was the second son of Fujiwara Fuyutsugu who had been Sadaijin. However, Fuyutsugu died while Yoshifusa was still quite young and he was only a middling level official without great prospects when he was assigned to work in the palace of the crown prince and became friendly with the future Nimmyo Tenno. Once Nimmyo became emperor Yoshifusa began to rise rapidly. When Michiyasu was made crown prince he was already married and had three children headed by prince Koretaka. In 843 Yoshifusa was able to introduce his daughter into this family. She was a granddaughter of Saga Tenno because Yoshifusa had been able to marry a daughter of the emperor, something currently permitted only to Fujiwaras among the aristocracy. This girl quickly produced a son who eventually enabled Yoshifusa to transform the political situation in his favor.

Nimmyo's reign was not a successful one. All of the registers and maps were prepared for a land distribution in 844, but it was never carried out. There is no explanation given as to why. There was to be no further attempt for more than 30 years. The quality of life in the capital was deteriorating visibly. There were thieves and bandits everywhere and fires were constant. It appears that thieves often set fires and sounded the alarm and when the occupants of the house fled out one side, the thieves entered the other side to loot it. Occasionally such fires spread and destroyed large sections of the city. The Kebiishi proved unable to cope successfully with this and for a time the regular guards troops were deployed in the streets in the area around the palace where most noble mansions were located as patrolmen. 

Nimmyo became ill in 850. Two days before his death he took the vows of a Buddhist monk. He was only 41. His mother became a Buddhist nun and two of his brothers became Buddhist monks. This was unprecedented in that Kammu Tenno and his three sons had all been conspicuously Confucian in orientation. When they wrote poetry, they wrote it in Chinese. However, Buddhism was now very obviously on the rise among the common people and the nobility alike. This is often associated with the noted monk Kukai, later considered the equivalent of a saint and awarded a postumous name, but it went far beyond the efforts of one man. From this time forward imperial monks become common, and many other nobles also took monastic vows late in life as a sign of retirement from public life.

Montoku Tenno was 24 years old when he ascended the throne. His son by Yoshifusa's daughter was immediately appointed the official heir despite being but one year old. This was entirely unprecedented, and particularly opposed to the system that Kammu Tenno had attempted to set up. Given that Saga Tenno had 50 children, there would have been no difficulty about finding a brother of Nimmyo capable of taking the throne. However, it is clear that we have returned to the general situation that had prevailed during the Soga dominance and at intervals during the Nara period when the relationship to the dominant noble family at court controlled the succession. To be fair, no one expected Montoku Tenno to die young, but still, the risk was obvious. At the time the senior official was Minamoto Tokiwa and Yoshifusa ranked second. However, Tokiwa died in 854.

The main problem afflicting the government at this time was rapidly falling revenue from taxes. The response was a series of edicts urging the people to pay attention to agriculture. The actual cause was the spread of shoen and the removal of lands from the tax registers. The government made no effort to enforce the land redistributions, nor did it follow up on the experimental direct farming system explored during Saga's reign. 

The year 857 saw numerous examples of dissatisfaction around the country. On the island of Tsushima, which was also a province, a mob of 300 men led by the district magistrates stormed the residence of the governor and burned it down, killing him and 16 other persons. In other places the locals limited themselves to sending in petitions protesting against misrule. In the same year Yoshifusa was appointed to the office of Dajodaijin, last occupied in 765 by the monk Dokyo. It may be that that was an attempt to respond to the crisis. Montoku's edict making the appointment specifically states that it was because Yoshifusa was his relative, and it may be that this was a first pass at the regency that followed soon after. A few months later the emperor fell gravely ill and he died in the 8th month of 858 at the age of 33. It is believed that he was always frail and it seems that he almost never left the palace. His son was placed on the throne becoming Seiwa Tenno. He was nine, the previous record (which occasioned much controversy at the time) was Mommu Tenno aged 15.

Despite his youth, Seiwa Tenno already had a Fujiwara wife, whose father was Yoshifusa's younger brother Nagayoshi. This woman eventually became the mother of Yozei Tenno. Nagayoshi was also the father of Yoshifusa's eventual successor, Mototsune. Yoshifusa did not have a son, nor did he have a spare daughter to marry to Seiwa Tenno. In the official genealogies Mototsune counts as Yoshifusa's son, but he was adopted.

In 862 a rather strange edict said, essentially, that everything was going to hell and all government officials needed to work harder. There is no evidence of anything specific being done. This is the beginning of the phase in which the provincial administration ceased to operate for the benefit of the government and instead became the personal fief of the governor, to loot to whatever extent he was capable. It is from this time that we see in the record frequent mentions of &quot;good officials&quot; who were honest and actually tried to run things in a manner that was fair to all. This flows from the Chinese idea that all that is necessary to have a successful government is moral officials. 

In 863 there was a major influenza epidemic and there was a wave of popular belief that it was caused by vengeful ghosts from imperial scandals going all the way back to the overthrow of Tenchi Tenno's son prince Sawara. The government held a public propitiation ceremony at Shinsenen, which was a vast garden that had been added to the southern side of the palace. A portion of thr garden survives today just south of Nijo Castle, which sits on the southeast corner of the ancient imperial palace. Many private ceremonies were also held, some of which attracted large crowds. The gatherings continued and the government attempted to prohibit them in 865. In 866 the emperor and all the leading nobles went to the mansion of Yoshifusa for a lavish cherry blossom viewing party. Ten days later one of the gates of the imperial palace, known as Otemon, burned down. This was popularly taken as a divine criticism of the government. The government tried to respond by mobilizing military forces which were sent out to deal with pirates in the Inland Sea and bandits operating in various places. In the midst of this one offical informed another that he had heard that the fire had been set on the orders of Minamoto Tokiwa. The second official immediately ordered Tokiwa's arrest. The officer who received this order was Fujiwara Mototsune. Instead of carrying it out he went to ask Yoshifusa what he thought about it, and Yoshifusa replied that he was sure that Tokiwa was innocent. He sent people to circulate around the palace and calm everyone down.

The man who started the rumor about Minamoto Tokiwa was Otomo Yoshio. Five months after the &quot;Otemon incident&quot; an informer accused Otomo of having burned the gate himself. He continued to protest his innocence under torture but was convicted and exiled along with four of his relatives. He was the grandson of a man who had been convicted in the murder of Fujiwara Tanetsugu in 785 and exiled.

When Yoshifusa died in 872 the government treated it as a crisis and mobilized the guard units and activated the barriers on the major roads, something ordinarily done only on the death of an emperor. However, there was no trouble and his heir Mototsune continued to exercise his authority and was immediately appointed regent. Seiwa Tenno abdicated in 876 and was replaced by Yozei Tenno, Mototsune's nephew. Yozei was nine and the regency continued.

In 878 there was a large scale rebellion of Emishi in Dewa province. There had been no serious fighting in the north since early in the reign of Saga Tenno. A provincial of neighboring Mutsu province who had the title of Oryoshi, which was a provincial version of the Kebiishi, on his own authority assembled an army of 2000 men and marched to Dewa where he found 5000 men at the provincial capital. About a month later they were attacked by rebels and the bulk of the army fled. Only one small unit commanded by a man named Funya Arifusa stayed to fight, but they were defeated. The rebels captured large quantities of military gear. 

Back in the capital, Fujiwara Yasunori, a man noted as a &quot;good official&quot; but with no military experience, was appointed governor and sent off to deal with the situation. He appears to have had only 600 men with him, but he found 300 more in Dewa, and then was reinforced by 2000 more men following behind him. He came under a lot of pressure from the government to attack the rebels, but he said that the rebels had problems of their own and he thought that with good government he could resolve the situation without fighting. He said that he wanted to get the farmers back to work, settle refugees, and build up his resources. The government permitted him to take this approach and the rebellion in fact came to an end with no more fighting and Yasunori was back in the capital before the end of 879. This is the last item in the history of the frontier wars. The northeast region remained an unusual region with a history in many ways independent of the rest of the country for a very long time, even into the 19th century in some ways, but it was administratively now a permanent part of Japan. The name Emishi went out of use soon after.

The record shows Fujiwara Mototsune as being much more aggressive than had been Yoshifusa in attacking the problems facing the government. He backed Fujiwara Yasunori's policies in Dewa and made an effort to try to put an end to the abuses commonly practiced by governors. However, it is clear that his focus was on trying to get moral men into office rather than changing administrative systems. He was responsble for last iteration of the land redistribution system. His edict on the matter pointed out that because of the lapse of this system the government had almost no idea of what was happening in the provinces. The registers were not being kept, so that there were no maps of the arable land and no indication of the numbers of taxpayers or where they were living, making it impossible to manage the tax system intelligently. 

In the five inner provinces we know that the government appointed five senior officials (all sangi) to go to the five provinces to supervise. The original law called for female members of the family to receive 2/3 of the allotment of a male, but this had been cut in 828 to 1/3 and now in 880 it was eliminated. Also, the allotments for males were changed from entirely rice paddy to a mixture of paddy land and dry land for wheat or millet. The redistribution was ordered for all provinces, but outside of the inner provinces the details were left up to the governor. There was a flood of complaints about difficulties, but there is evidence that the redistribution occurrred in at least 7 provinces and it is believed that it was pretty widespread, though we don't know how thorough it was outside of the inner provinces.

In 882 Yozei Tenno became a legal adult at the age of 15, and he inquired about terminating the regency. Instead a new title, kampaku, was invented to apply to the regency in respect to an adult emperor. About one year later Mototsune and the emperor quarreled about something unknown and refused to make up. Whatever one proposed the other tried to sabotage. At one point Mototsune proposed ending the regency and Yozei refused. Yozei was definitely an exception to the recent run of weakling emperors who died young. He lived to be 82. There is speculation that he was not sane. In late 883 there was an unsolved murder inside the imperial palace and the rumor was that it had been committed by the emperor in a rage over something. Mototsune increased his pressure on the emperor and in early 884 he abdicated. There was no designated successor. There was a prince who was Mototsune's grandson, Sadatoki, age 7. However, he was a son of Yozei and Mototsune appears to have been determined not to appoint a son of Yozei. Many candidates were discussed and the selection was prince Tokiyasu, a brother of Montoku Tenno. His mother was a Fujiwara, though from a different branch of the clan than Mototsune. He was 55 years of age and had a modest career working in the government. He was Koko Tenno. Despite the age of the new ruler and his experience working in the government the regency was continued. It is claimed that this was the decision of the emperor himself. The best man should rule, and the best man was Mototsune. 

In 885 Mototsune's son Tokihira achieved adulthood and was launched on his official career. 

There was no immediate decision on an heir to Koko Tenno. The emperor wanted his 7th son Minamoto Sadami. This presented a problem in that as a Minamoto he had been removed from the imperial clan, legally speaking. Mototsune had rejected one candidate to succeed Yozei on exactly that ground. However, this time he agreed. Sadami was formally restored to the clan and made crown prince. His mother was not a Fujiwara but an imperial princess. The same day this was accomplished the emperor died and prince Sadami immediately succeeded. He is designated Uda Tenno. When the retired emperor Yozei was informed of this he said, &quot;but isn't he a servant?&quot; As Minamoto Sadami the new emperor had served as a page in the palace. This all occurred in 887.

The first edict issued by Uda Tenno contains the first use of the word Kampaku. The edict changed the name of Mototsune's office to &quot;ako.&quot; Mototsune protested that the new word didn't mean anything. The two fought about this with many arguments for six months before Uda finally issued an edict putting everything back the way it was. One historian called this &quot;the Ako War.&quot; It signalled that Uda was not going to be anyone's puppet emperor. 

Mototsune then died in 891 before he could arrange for a proper successor through a new grandson or get his sons advanced to high positions in the government. He had 4 sons, Tokihira, Kanehira, Nakahira, and Tadahira, and 4 daughters. Two of them were married to Seiwa Tenno, one was married to Uda Tenno, and the last would eventually become married to Daigo Tenno. Tokihira was 21 years old and not yet of Sangi rank. As manager of the fortunes of the northern branch of the Fujiwara clan Mototsune seems to have made a real mess of the position achieved by Yoshifusa.

At this point in time occurred the beginning of the great age of classical Japanese literature. Up to then literature in Japan had meant Chinese literature, even though &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Kojiki&lt;/i&gt; contain snippets written in Japanese by using Chinese characters for their sound only, and the great &lt;i&gt;Manyoshu&lt;/i&gt; collection of Japanese poetry had been put together using the same method. Now, a simple and elegant system for writing Japanese with a syllabary of about 50 characters (the exact number varied for a time) based on highly simplified Chinese characters had been invented and come into wide use. There were some exceptions, but it was generally thought that there was no need for women to learn to read and write Chinese, so any literature intended for both men and women must necessarily be written in Japanese. The first major book published was &lt;i&gt;Ise Monogatari&lt;/i&gt; which may be considered a tribute to the life and works of Ariwara Narihira, a poet who died in 880. The exact date of the book is not known, but it was early in the 10th century. Another crucial book for this era is &lt;i&gt;Konjaku Monogatari&lt;/i&gt;. It is thought to have been completed around 1077 but it is a collection of short stories that includes much old material, including many pieces evidently written about this time.

When Mototsune died emperor Uda wasted no time in reestablishing the principle that the emperor is the ruler. The office of Kampaku lapsed and was not revived for forty years.

===Yasunori, Michizane, and Tokihira===
The emperor took several measures to try to assure that control would remain in hands of the imperial clan. He made sure to promote men from several lineages of the Fujiwara clan so that they could be rivals of each other, and he also moved many of his relatives into the Minamoto clan and appointed them to high office. At the same time that the 21 year old Tokihira was raised to the sangi level, so was Uda’s brother Minamoto no Osamoto. And, over the next few years Osamoto was followed by Sadatsune, Tato, Mare, and Noboru. In 893 the emperor established as crown prince Atsuhito, 9 years old, whose mother, although a Fujiwara, was only a cousin of Tokihira. Her father, Takafuji was first raised to the sangi at this time, possibly to serve as a rival to Tokihira. Finally, he raised two relatively obscure “good governors” to high office. They were Fujiwara Yasunori, one year after the death of Mototsune, and Sugawara no Michizane, the year after. Yoshifusa and Mototsune had run things for 30 years, between them, and Uda was now trying to do something quite different. 

At the top level his government had 7 Fujiwara and 6 Minamoto and one lonely representative of the remaining ancient aristocracy in the person of Sugawara no Michizane. The sadaijin was Minanoto Toru, aged 72, followed by Fujiwara Yoshiyo, also 72, Minamoto Yoshiari, only 50, Minamoto Hikaru, 49, Fujiwara Morokatsu , 66, and Fujiwara Tokihira, now 23. Yoshiyo was now the chief of the Fujiwara clan, however Tokihira’s prospects were still pretty good since he was going to outlive all of these men and inevitably rise to the top barring some disaster. And, it was not enough for Uda to assert himself. He had to show that he could pull it off, politically, over the long run. His elevation of Yasunori and Michizane was going to be very important to him. It was necessary that it work out. There were plenty of problems to deal with. It was pretty clear that the pattern of rural government established in the Nara period had broken down. 

Fujiwara Yasunori was from the “southern” branch of the Fujiwara that had been knocked out of the top aristocracy. His grandfather had held the rank of chunagon, but his father never got higher than vice-commander of one of the guards units, barely clinging to aristocratic status. In 855 Yasunori got a low ranking post in the central bureaucracy, and in 871 he went to Bitchu province as a zuryo, and subsequently transferred to Bingo. In 878 when the rebellion in Dewa broke out, Mototsune assigned him as the governor supporting the forces sent to deal with it. He was, as previously noted, very successful and suppressed the rebellion despite an extreme shortage of resources and with a minimum of violence. After that he went back to work as a zuryo, but he continued to attract attention as a “good official” in Sanuki province and as the deputy commander at Dazaifu. Immediately after Mototsune’s death emperor Uda brought him back to the capital and in the next year raised him to the sangi level. At the time he was 68 years old (and therefore no real threat to Tokihira).

Yasunori was certainly well qualified to advise the government about conditions in the countryside and what it took to be able to keep the peace, as he had successfully done for many years. 

Sugawara no Michizane’s route to high office was somewhat different. Following his grandfather and father, he was a scholar attached to the university and a well-known poet (since the age of 11). Neither his grandfather nor his father had had any political or governmental role. However, his father Koreyoshi had been promoted to sangi rank in 872 (when Michizane was 28), opening the way for Michizane to seek a career, if he wished to. In 874 Michizane was given 5th rank, passed through several minor bureaucratic offices, and in 877 was given a concurrent appointment as professor at the university. In 886 he was appointed governor of Sanuki province and decided to actually go to his province, resigning 3 other posts in the central government to do so.

He was in Sanuki for 4 years. While there he wrote a book of 140 poems, but also worked hard to be a “good official” in the mode of Yasunori, with whom he was familiar, work that shows up in many of the poems. When he returned to the capital he was among those who criticized Mototsune’s determination to remain Kampaku over an adult emperor. This naturally attracted Uda’s attention. 

Emperor Uda had a strategy for dealing with the problems facing the government, but it was not one that involved creating new arrangements. Rather it was an attempt to go back to the approaches of the Nara period system. The main idea seems to be that if the system were run humanely, people would accept it. This is very Confucian, holding that morality is far more important than structure in solving governmental problems. His reign title combined characters for benevolence and tranquility. 

The immediate goal was to return to the policy of the first years of Mototsune’s control (877-884) and resurrect the handen system. Yasunori had been in the field as a zuryo when the last distribution was accomplished. Historians are inclined to think that the reform effort did not just depend on the men at the top, because the middle and lower ranking officials in the central government realized that if the tax revenues failed they were doomed. Only the very highest in rank could form shoen. And, although zuryo were doing very well at the moment, if the opposition of the local aristocrats, the farmers, and the shoen owners did not weaken, their long term prospects were not good either. Fujiwara Tokihira was not opposed to this line of thinking and came to be counted among the reformers himself.

Yasunori led the efforts to reform rural government from 892 until his death three years later. Afterward, Michizane and Tokihira were the leaders. The first thing that was done was to repeat a step taken several times since the time of Tenchi Tenno and send out inspectors to gather information about conditions in the countryside and what local people thought about them. In actual fact the district magistrates were responsible for gathering testimony from locals and passing it on to the inspectors. There are no details about exactly what was done, but it is usually assumed that shoen were ignored since the focus was to be on zuryo and whether they were performing properly or abusing their powers. 

Another aspect of the effort was an attempt to cut the cost of the central government by abolishing unnecessary offices and combining their functions into the remaining ones. The number of men on duty in the various guards units was considerably reduced also. 

There was also thought given to resuming contact with China. The last embassy had been more than 60 years previously. In 894 it was ordered that an embassy was to be organized and that Michizane should be the ambassador, but only 1 month later he recommended that the project be abandoned, and it was. The T'ang dynasty was in the process of collapsing at this time and the prospects for a successful embassy were actually not very good. The kingdom of Silla in Korea was also in a state of collapse. After 890 or so it had almost no control over its provinces, and local groups began fighting each other for primacy. In 900 there began a large scale civil war that only resulted in unification under a new dynasty in 936. This breakdown of order led to a major increase in the incidence of attacks by Korean pirates on Japan, at first mainly on the island of Tsushima, but later in much of northern Kyushu. In 893 there was a large scale raid in Higo province and many farmers houses were burned. In 894 the government sent additional troops to Tsushima, and provinces along the Japan Sea coast were ordered to take precautions. This of course shows that they still had the resources to respond to such a situation.

In 896 Yasunori died, and he was soon followed by the sadaijin Minamoto no Toru, and at the end of the year the newly promoded sadaijin Fujiwara Yoshiyo also died. In 897 the udaijin Minamoto Yoshiari followed. Suddenly Tokihira at the age of 26 was the senior official in the government. Uda was worried about this and consulted with Michizane. The decision was to immediately enthrone the emperor’s son. Uda abdicated and emperor Daigo took the throne at the age of 13. This was clearly to obviate any threat that Tokihira might manage to manipulate the succession to his advantage. A daughter of emperor Koko was immediately married to the emperor and made empress. One of Michizane’s daughters was married to Uda’s second son, prince Tokiyo. As usually was the case, Uda planned to continue ruling despite his abdication.

In 899 Tokihira was appointed sadaijin and Michizane udaijin. Fujiwara Takafuji and Minamoto Hikaru were made Dainagon. Takafuji was soon promoted to naidaijin but died almost immediately afterwards. However, his son Sadakuni was immediately promoted to the sangi to take his place.

It is believed that Tokihira began actively plotting to remove Michizane at about this time. His wedge was the fact that Michizane had been rapidly promoted to a much higher rank than his pedigree qualified him for because of the improper favor of emperor Uda. This made it easy to promote resentment against Michizane among the other courtiers. Uda continued to shower favors on him, which made the campaign all the easier. Finally, at the beginning of 901 Tokihira sprung his trap. Having made an ally of Minamoto Hikaru, they went together to emperor Daigo and told him that Michizane planned to force him to abdicate so that his son in law prince Tokiyo could become emperor. Retired emperor Uda had already agreed to this plan, they said. After a few days of this, they secured an edict denouncing Michizane’s crime and banishing him to Kyushu in the usual role of unpaid supernumary official at Dazaifu. 5 days later Uda went to the palace to discuss the matter with the emperor, but Tokihira had arranged that he would not be allowed to enter. This was a case where Tokihira was able to take advantage of the abdication. In much later times retired emperors issued edicts directly, but in this period valid edicts came only from the reigning emperor.

This coup did not change the fact that Uda generally ran the government until his death, and Tokihira learned to get along with him. However, Michizane was eliminated as a political factor. This event is still well remembered in Japan. Because Michizane was a prominent poet, the writers and artists of the day were all on his side, so his fate was accorded a lot of artistic attention over the years. He died of illness at Dazaifu in 903 at the age of 59. He had time to write a book about his experiences in exile.

Soon after the coup emperor Daigo’s wife Onshi, a sister of Tokihira, gave birth to a son, prince Munekata, the future emperor Suzaku. With this the Fujiwara for the third time put themselves in position to gain a special position in relation to the throne. Only three months later this prince was made the heir. 

Starting in 902 the government issued a stream of edicts directed toward the reform of provincial government. They were all aimed at restoring the proper operation of things according to the original ryo, except as modified by subsequent kyaku and shiki. And, the government took up the matter of handen. Nothing had been done about this since 881 despite the reforming aspirations of Yasunori and Michizane, and this had had a big effect upon local government.

There had been time for the relationship between population and the allocation of the land to drift so that some had too much land and some too little, which made it difficult to assess and collect taxes. The government ordered all provinces to conduct a thorough census, 12 years after which the distribution would be conducted. This was a huge gap. All previous distributions had been carried out over a three year period from census to execution. There is no explanation as to why this was decided.

From the associated edicts it was clear that the government intended to strictly enforce the letter of the law in respect to the quality of goods accepted for the head tax and the timing of their delivery. There was to be no retreat from fill compliance with earlier practices.

There were obstacles to making this work as planned. “Wicked farmers, seeking to evade the taxes, move to the capital on their own initiative and attach themselves to wealthy households, or lie about their lands claiming that they have been donated, or claim that their houses have been sold, or take documents issued by a noble and affix seals to them and claim privilege. Even though they suspect these seals are forgeries, the governors cringe before higher authority, say nothing, and do not prevent these crimes.”

Also, in the absence of any census and distribution, all &quot;new land&quot; opened up on the initiative of locals was effectively private land and most likely not entered on any registers, making it effectively shoen land even if it didn't have documents. A thorough census and land survey would find it all, of course, and was not likely to be very popular.

The government now prohibited people in the countryside from donating lands and residences to temples and shrines, and the opening of new lands under protection was also to be stopped. Only shoen which could demonstrate valid documents from the dajokan and minbusho were to be continued. It was not at all clear exactly what might have come out of all of this because Tokihira died in 909 at the age of 39 and the reform effort died with him.

==The development of the shoen system==

Shoen is the name given to private estates that were exempt from the land redistribution process and were also immune to all or some taxes and were sometimes also immune to the entry of public officials. For most historians shoen were considered such a conspicuous aspect of life in the Heian period that the term &quot;the shoen system&quot; is often considered synonymous with the Heian period, to be contrasted with &quot;the ritsuryo system&quot; for the Nara period and &quot;the feudal system (hoken)&quot; for the subsequent periods.

The prohibition of privately owned land was never absolute, but the intention of the authorities was clearly that it would be limited to rare and special purposes. During the Nara period there were experiments with permitting nobles to pay for the necessary work to bring new lands under cultivation and then to be reimbursed by being allowed to treat the land as private property for a limited period of time, after which it would be taken into the redistribution system. Various edicts make it clear that there were abuses in which men tried to grab public lands and claim that they had reclaimed them, or illegally used public resources and corvee laborers to reclaim land which they then claimed for themselves.

That type of private land had disadvantages as well as advantages for it remained fully taxable and remained under the police powers of the provincial and district governments.

Shomu Tenno decided to provide funds for the operation of his new Todaiji temple by granting the temple lands that would be exempt from taxes, the taxes instead going to the temple as revenue. Subsequently, numerous other temples were financed the same way, and as the result of complaints from the monks, rules were passed granting these estates various degrees of immunity from the local officials. The nobility took notice, because this type of landholding looked attractive. The monks had no interest in farming land themselves. The normal mechanism for creating a shoen was for a management contract to be entered into whereby a local aristocrat would take responsibility for running the estate in return for a share of the profits. Usually the noble would open up new land and then &quot;donate&quot; it to the temple in return for such a management agreement. This removed the land permanently from the tax rolls. 

Almost all surviving documents relating to shoen were preserved in temple archives, mainly the Todaiji archive, and there is no real documentation for the process whereby shoen began to be used for estates owned by noblemen rather than temples, but there is no doubt that it happened. It probably started during the period when Saga Tenno was in charge, but a lot of people suspect that it was mainly Fujiwara Yoshifusa who fostered the process. Essentially all that was required was to secure a charter from the emperor designating the land as shoen and defining its priveleges. As regent, Yoshifusa was legally entitled to create such charters on his own. It now became possible for Yoshifusa to enrich himself that way, and also to extend the privilege to his political allies within the nobility. It is very clear from complaints coming in and the efforts of reformers that one very important channel for the creation of shoen was via the provincial governors. The governor with his political connections in the capital could arrange for charters relatively easily, raking off a share of the profits for himself. In particular we see numerous edicts attempting to prevent governors from retiring to a province they had ruled, out of the expectation that if they could do so they would aspire to put togther a collection of shoen lands there to finance their retirement.

The shoen system eventually became very complicated. The way it was structured several different parties had explicitly recognized &quot;rights,&quot; called by the Japanese historians &quot;shiki,&quot; in various aspects of the shoen. In addition to the &quot;proprietor&quot; (ryoshu) in the capital, the on-site manager had a property right that was shiki, and the several lower level officers who were necessary for the management of the estate and the collection of its revenues also had explicitly defined shiki. Once these existed, it became possible to inherit them and to sell them. Logically enough, it followed that they could be divided. A man might leave his shiki to be divided equally among his children, for example. It therefore became possible for a person to own one quarter of the shiki pertaining to the office of collector of rents, without any personal obligation to do any of that work. It became merely the right to a certain specified income. As you may easily imagine, this led enevitably in the direction of causing numerous lawsuits. In principle, the proprietor was responsible for handling disputes over shiki that were entirely internal to the shoen. This was one of the factors in causing the Heian period nobles to set up business offices within their mansions. Sometimes, of course, people on the shoen found it desirable to sue the proprietor, or the proprietor might have a problem with their behavior.

The official legal system had no way to handle these matters. The very concept of a lawsuit was not a part of the administrative laws. If people had a complaint they could petition the Dajokan, which might appoint someone to investigate the matter and determine how the law applied to it. This was where shiki in the sense of kyaku and shiki came from. When an official determined how the law applied to a situation he wrote out his conclusions and filed a copy and this was called a shiki. Clearly the shiki considered as a property right in a shoen was thought of as being much the same, a written description of the rule that had been agreed on for the particular situation.

In the time of Saga Tenno it is most likely the case that law suits went mainly to his Kurodo office. The ultimate decision was credited to the emperor, but would actually be made by some official within the office. As regent, Fujiwara Yoshifusa set up his own version of the Kurodo, since &quot;the regency&quot; was not a legal office and did not appear in the budget or have a suite of offices assigned to it. From this time as long as the system lasted, whoever was the top dog in the political structure had to maintain a private lawcourt where officials of his appointment could examine the documents and interview witnesses pertaining to disputes over rights within shoen. This court had to appear to be at least moderately efficient and moderately fair or people would stop coming. After the collapse of the official administrative system these courts were almost the only regularly functioning organ of government, and the fact that someone had to provide them was the most powerful factor in permitting the government to hang onto existence in a context where it no longer had meaningful revenues.

Even in Yoshifusa's day, and to a steadily increasing extent as time passed, the government had no regular means to enforce judgements made by these courts. It was assumed that the two parties would abide by the judgement. The only lever it had was that if the losing side ignored the decision the court could disestablish the shoen and declare its charter void, turning it over to the mercies of the provincial governor. A particularly egregious individual could also be proclaimed an outlaw, in which case his heavily armed neighbors were free to go after him and seize his property. 

There was a lot of violence in the countryside starting roughly in Yoshifusa's time, and the best way to mitigate it was for provincials to respect the shoen system and the regent's (or later the retired emperor's) court. People did not actually want to live in a lawless society, so there was always a delicate balance. The government could not afford to maintain real police forces, so the people had to police themselves, which was inherently messy and open to abuse, but by resorting to the courts and respecting their decisions people were able to put pressure on the armed landowners to behave themselves, more or less. This was a time of what might be termed restrained chaos.

A highly similar set of arrangements developed within the district and provincial administrations also. Appointments to local office were mostly hereditary anyway, but now it came to be treated as a formal property right that could, again, be inherited, sold, and subdivided. By the 10th century this process was far advanced, so that although the legal terminology was different, the actual way of life was not much different on a shoen and on &quot;public&quot; land. The main difference is that the provincial governorship did not ever become truly hereditary but was handed out for a term of years. However, it came to be the case that the governor ceased to actually travel to his province but sent an agent known as a zuryo, which means someone serving in your place. Even the governorship became a shiki right and in the 12th century a man of great power might hold six or eight governorships simultaneously, solely for his cut of the revenue.

This was a very peculiar system, obviously. The best way to understand it is to see it as a process of very slow collapse. Things always got worse, they never got better, the success rate of the courts in enforcing decisions went down, the level of local violence went up. At some point it was inevitable that the whole thing would fail completely, and many people were aware of this. It follows that some of those people began to put together new systems to take its place. However, the early Heian period is the era of decline. The first signs of new types of arrangements do not appear until the following century.

There is a lot of information about conflict in the countryside between governors (mostly now zuryo) and the locals over taxes and other matters. In the absence of proper tax registers, we find the zuryo improvising. There is a memorial from a zuryo in Kii province in 894 to the Dajokan. He said that rather than try to sort out taxes using the old rules, which was impossible given the information he had, he assessed a flat rate on everyone farming land no matter what their status might be of a fixed number of sheaves per unit of area. This was a comprehensive amount intended to cover crop tax, head tax, and corvee. The government approved this method, which completely ignored all of the laws. One might say that at this point the original system of the Taiho code was completely extinct.

In 884 there was an incident where a mob stated to consist of 170 farmers was organized by two district magistrates of Iwami province to attack the zuryo, who was seriously beaten, and other outrages were committed. The government sent officials to the province to investigate and the case was resolved 2 years later. The zuryo was exiled on the grounds that his illegal behavior caused the uprising. However, the two magistrates and three others who took leading roles were also punished for resorting to violence, but they were merely sentenced to suspension of their offices for one year. There was also a case in which locals petitioned against the governor and investigators were sent who found the governor guilty of crimes. However, the same man was later appointed governor again, and was accused again in his new province, though he died before the new investigation was completed.

Between 892 and 909 there occurred a major effort at &quot;reform&quot; of the government of the provinces including a project to restart the land redistribution system. There is no clear information as to exactly what impacts this had upon the ground, but it does seem certain that the effort came to an end when Fujiwara Tokihira died in 909. From that time onward the shoen system expanded steadily and eventually came to have equal status with the taxation system and the joint sources for the incomes of the nobles of the capital. It is the consensus that officially speaking no more than about half of the country's farm land ever came to be treated as shoen. The rest continued to be &quot;public land&quot; subject to the authority of the provincial governor and district magistrates. However, as noted above, the practical difference between the two from the point of view of the people living on the land became less and less over time.

The shoen system lasted for some time and started to fall apart only in the 13th century, when a completely new form of landholding began to appear, essentially the beginning of the type of landownership that exists today, with the concept that the land belongs to the state replaced by an explicit recognition that land is private property which can be inherited, sold, or rented at the discretion of its owner, who may be a commoner or an aristocrat or an organization. The interest of government in the land is limited to the right to tax it.

==The Regency (Sessho and Kampaku)==

The offices of Sessho and Kampaku that gave the holder the power to speak for the emperor (whether the emperor wanted this or didn't) were always the exclusive property of members of the Fujiwara clan. In archaic times the imperial clan was surrounded by a number of other clans of varying status. Almost the first thing that happens once we get into a period where detailed information about politics is available is that we find a ferocious struggle amongst the Otomo, Mononobe, and Soga clans for a position of dominance at court. Sometimes the emperor is actually the man in charge, but sometimes he is not up to the task and someone else has to do it. The Soga clan appears to have pioneered the strategy of manipulating the imperial succession so that the successive rulers are all children of Soga mothers. They managed to do this for three generations, but were then defeated by prince Naka no Oe, assisted by Nakatomi no Kamatari. Kamatari played such an important part in subsequent events that when he died a grateful imperial clan created an entirely new clan for his descendants. The name of this clan was, of course, Fujiwara. At the time that this happened the imperial palace was located at a place called Fujiwara, and I presume that that is the origin of the name. 

Kamatari's son was Fuhito who also played a crucial role in the continued evolution of the new system of government. He had four sons who established four branches of the clan, but among these only the &quot;northern&quot; branch descended from Fusasaki survived the Nara period in a position of considerable political power. Yoshifusa, the first Sessho, was Fusasaki's great-great-grandson. During his lifetime Fusasaki took second place to his older brother Muchimaro, but had a succesful career in his own right. Muchimaro's son Toyonari continued in the highest position, but Fusasaki's son Matate reached the sangi also. He died in 766 during the Dokyo era.  His son Uchimaro reached the position of naidaijin when Heizei became emperor after the death of Kammu in 806. He died in office in 812. His son Fuyutsugu played an important part in the events of 810. He had been appointed head of the Kurodo office by Saga Tenno at the start of the year and he was one of the two officials to whom Heizei appealed for support against Saga. However, he remained loyal to Saga. Fuyutsugu became the senior minister in 821 and died in 826 at a comparatively early age, 52, leaving his son Yoshifusa in a relatively low position. Montoku Tenno who took the throne in 850 was a grandson of Fuyutsugu, but this had little practical effect given that Fuyutsugu was long dead. 

Yoshifusa was able to seize power from a relatively humble starting position when the retired emperor Saga died in 842. He had been assigned to work in the palace of the crown prince who eventually became Nimmyo Tenno, who was on the throne in 842. Apparently the two became very close, so when Yoshifusa informed the emperor that there was a plot against him he was believed. We have no way of knowing the truth of the matter, but the end result was the demotion of one group of officials and the promotion of a second group headed by Yoshifusa. In 848 he became the senior minister lasting through the transition to Montoku Tenno and in 857 was able to claim the office of Dajodaijin, the highest of all. He was the first to hold this since the unfortunate precedents of Fujiwara Nakamaro and the monk Dokyo in the Nara period. He was thus in complete control of the government and able to designate his own grandson, a mere infant, as heir to the throne. When Montoku Tenno died and the child became emperor as Seiwa Tenno he was 9 years old and obviously required a regent and the only candidate was Yoshifusa. This was in 858. In 866 Yoshifusa secured formal appointment to the newly created office of Sessho. There had been one previous regency in the Nara period but the regent had been an imperial prince.

Yoshifusa died in 872 when Seiwa Tenno was 23 years old, but the regency continued under his son Mototsune right up to Seiwa's abdication in 876. The new emperor Yozei Tenno was also a child and the regency continued. Yozei appeared to be insane and was forced to abdicate in favor of Koko Tenno in 884. Koko was 55 years old but the regency still continued, as it did when Uda became emperor at the age of 21. It only lapsed when Mototsune died in 891 and Uda refused to appoint a replacement.

The office remained in abeyance through the reigns of Uda and Daigo, which is to say up to 930. However, it resumed under Fujiwara Tadahira, Mototsune's son, who was the grandfather of Suzaku Tenno, age 8. This time the office remained permanent, even outlasting the power of the Fujiwara clan. It was abolished in 1868 but revived again in 1889 in the Meiji Constitution, but it was taken away from the Fujiwara clan and restricted to the imperial clan. Taisho Tenno, Mutsuhito, was considered to be mentally disabled and his son Hirohito, the future Showa Tenno, served as Sessho from 1921 to 1926.

In 1947 the law which defined the Imperial Household Agency continued to recognize the office. 

==The beginnings of the warrior (bushi) class==

Since at least 400 AD Japan had been dominated by an aristocracy that was notionally a warrior class. When we first see them in &lt;i&gt;Nihon Shoki&lt;/i&gt; they wore swords on all occasions and used them frequently. In battle they fought wearing armor and riding on horseback and their principal weapon was the bow. This description would apply without any change to the rural aristocracy of the 12th and 13th centuries. However, a lot happened between the archaic period and the beginnings of the feudal era. Still, even in the peaceful Heian period members of the aristocracy routinely trained with weapons. This tends to be obscured because of the fact that much of the literature of the late Heian period was written by women whose view of the daily activities of the male aristocrats was limited. Young nobles played violent sports, they practiced sword fighting and archery, and they went on long hunting trips where they hunted deer from horseback with bows and wild boars on foot with spears.

The establishment of Chinese style government in the 7th century made significant changes, however. An official army was set up officered by aristocrats but made up of conscripted peasants who were expected to fight on foot with spears and bows in the Chinese manner. In the middle of the 7th century this army was significant due to the threat of invasion by the Chinese or Koreans, but the absence of any invasion or any serious threat of invasion after the 660s allowed the army to mostly wither away except for the guard regiments in the capital. The government sought to sequester all military arms in armories to be distributed in time of need.

The only significant regular armed forces were border guards maintained on the northern coast of Kyushu and forces in the northeast that were frequently engaged in conflict with barbarian people beyond the effective Japanese frontier. These troops were essentially militia modeled after the regular army, meaning aristocratic officers and commoner soldiers who fought on foot (because commoners didn't know how to ride horses). There is a very interesting note from the Heian period about the problem of training foot soldiers to fight Emishi barbarians who fought in the ancient Japanese manner as mounted bowmen. The solution was to equip the troops with powerful Chinese crossbows, parts from which turn up in northern archeological sites. Whenever a political blowup occurred in the capital that led to violence, the persons involved attempted to flee to the east or send messengers to the east in order to raise experienced troops. There were also occasions when officers would simply go into the fields near the capital and grab peasants, shove spears into their hands, and proclaim them an army. This was done at the time of &quot;Nakamaro's rebellion&quot; in the Nara period.

This began to change as the result of the spread of the shoen system and the corresponding collapse of the system of provinces and districts. The authorities had conscripted peasants for a short period of military training and some of these trained men had served police functions as part of their obligation for corvee labor. However, the financial changes of the 9th century caused large areas of land to be removed from the authority of the provincial governor and the district magistrate as shoen. The men who managed the shoen had to provide their own police services. And, in the land (roughly half even at the height of shoen) that remained &quot;public&quot; the offices associated with the province and the district came to be matters of revenue only, with no requirement of doing any work. The provincial governor ceased to go to his province and merely sent out agents to plunder it at thoroughly as they could manage. As a consequence local landowners of all sorts began to arm some of their men as a private militia.

There is a collection of short stories &lt;i&gt;Konjaku Monogatari&lt;/i&gt; that report on conditions late in the 9th century and many of the stories concern rural landowners. One particularly charming one concerns two men who conceived a dislike for each other and therefore concluded that they should settle matters by fighting a war. They each formed up their parties of armed peasants and marched them off to an agreed upon site at an agreed upon time. The two principals were equipped as proper warriors with horses, armor and bows. Their followers were foot soldiers with spears. What actually happened was the the two little armies drew up opposite each other across a large field to watch as spectators, and the two principals fought a duel, on horseback, with bows. They charged about seeking a good shot at each other. Each was able to fire once and hit his opponent but failed to penetrate his armor. Then they paused for a rest, complemented each other on the quality of their riding and their shooting and decided that they would be friends. The war was called off.

It is impossible not to conclude that significant elements of the ancient warrior ethos seen in tales of the 5th and 6th centuries had survived among the rural nobility thoughout the intervening period. This suggests that the changes in rural life imposed by the new regime may have been less impressive on the ground than they were in the law books. In social terms everything is present for the development of the bushi class (more often called in English the samurai class) of later times. 

The difference between the scene in &lt;i&gt;Konjaku Monogatari&lt;/i&gt; and what one would see in &lt;i&gt;Heike Monogatari&lt;/i&gt; (13th century) or &lt;i&gt;Taiheiki&lt;/i&gt; (14th century) is that the warrior tradition was disseminated to a much wider segment of the rural population. In archaic times the warriors were all aristocrats, a completely different class of person than the ordinary farmers. In the later periods every landowner who could afford the expense normally equipped himself as a warrior and also equipped a number of his men to fight in the same mounted archer style. 

At first these men remained of low social status and were referred to as rodo which meant a man who had no land and who worked for his food and lodging at whatever task he was given, a common laborer. However once a man was trained to fight in the aristocratic style and had placed his life on the line alongside his master his effective status tended to rise quickly. The term rodo fell by the wayside somewhere along the line, but samurai is derived from the verb meaning &quot;to serve&quot; in the sense of to serve dinner but was gradually elevated to a term of pride. 

The actual social status of a warrior could be relatively high or relatively low. Some of them were authentic aristocrats, descendants of emperors and commanders of armies numbering thousands. Others were large or small landowners with large or small bands of personal followers. Still others were individuals who owned no land and were provided with food and lodging by their master. But they were all warriors and treated each other with respect.

Another matter of importance is that there is a great difference between organizing some of your dependents into a personal militia for local self defense (or annoying your neighbors) and creating something like an army. An army must necessarily include men who are not your personal followers whom you have known since childhood. This was dealt with by forming a system based on patronage. In the classical American big city political machine the leader would be able to mobilize an army of election workers who would go out and do everything that they could to persuade the voters to vote the right way. If the election was a success, then those workers would be rewarded by being appointed to city jobs. You scratch my back and I will scratch yours. Feudalism is a method of government that is based on this principle.

An ambitious aristocratic warrior who wanted to build an army would attempt to recruit landowners to serve him on the promise that a major task of the army that resulted would be to protect the landowners who comprised it. You fight for me when I need it, and I will fight for you when you need it. He could not demand support in the way that emperors demanded it, he needed to persuade men to support him, and to do that he had to make deals. Feudal vassalage is not slavery, it is a deal which requires mutual support and also mutual respect. It contains the element that if a feudal leader treats his men badly they will desert him and they will not be thought disloyal for doing it. 

You will say, but that's not the way it works in the samurai movies! The answer to that is that the samurai movies are not about feudalism but about a later time when the armor looked similar but the rules were completely different. In the society that is the real basis for the movie samurai the armies were once more peasants fighting on foot with spears or guns and the samurai were the officer class. It was much more like serving under an emperor and not at all like serving in a feudal band. 

At the point that this section ends, 909, there were not yet any actual feudal armies, there were only well-armed landowners who fell into the usual categories of public spirited defenders of law and order and neighborhood hoodlums. There are accounts of gangs of thugs who stole whatever they could and others about bands of vigilantes who rose up against crooked governors. We will not see the first true example of feudal warfare until 40 years or so have passed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:macarthur hirohito.jpg|thumb|200px|General MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito]]
At the end of World War II, Japan was occupied by the Allied Powers, led by the United States with contributions from Australia, India, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This foreign presence marked the first time in its history that the island nation had been occupied by a foreign power. The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, marked the end of the Allied occupation, and subsequent to its coming into force on April 28, 1952, Japan was once again an independent country.

==Post-Surrender==
On V-J Day, United States President Harry Truman appointed General Douglas MacArthur as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers (SCAP), to supervise the occupation of Japan. During the war, the Allied Powers had planned to divide Japan amongst themselves for the purposes of occupation, as was done for the occupation of Germany. Under the final plan, however, SCAP was given direct control over the main islands of Japan (Honshū, Hokkaidō, Shikoku and Kyūshū) and the immediately surrounding islands, while outlying possessions were divided between the Allied Powers as follows:

*Soviet Union: North Korea (not a full occupation), Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands.
*United States: South Korea (not a full occupation), Okinawa, the Amami Islands, the Ogasawara Islands and Japanese possessions in Micronesia.
*China: Taiwan and Penghu.

It is unclear why the occupation plan was changed. Common theories include the increased power of the United States following development of the atomic bomb, Truman's greater distrust of the Soviet Union when compared with Roosevelt, and an increased desire to contain Soviet expansion in the Far East after the Yalta Conference.

The Soviet Union had some intentions of occupying Hokkaidō. Had this occurred, there might have been the foundation of a communist &quot;Democratic People's Republic of Japan&quot; in the Soviet zone of occupation. However, unlike the Soviet occupations of East Germany and North Korea, these plans were frustrated by the opposition of President Truman.

The Far Eastern Commission and Allied Council For Japan were also established to supervise the occupation of Japan.

Japanese officials left for Manila on August 19 to meet MacArthur and to be briefed on his plans for the occupation. On August 28, 150 U.S. personnel flew to Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture. They were followed by The &quot;USS ''Missouri'', whose accompanying vessels landed the US 4th Marine Division on the southern coast of Kanagawa. Other Allied personnel followed.

MacArthur arrived in Tokyo on August 30, and immediately decreed several laws: No Allied personnel were to assault Japanese people. No Allied personnel were to eat the scarce Japanese food. Flying the ''Hinomaru'' or &quot;Rising Sun&quot; flag was initially severely restricted (although individuals and prefectural offices could apply for permission to fly it). The restriction was partially lifted in 1948 and completely lifted the following year. The Hinomaru was the ''de facto'' albeit not ''de jure'' flag throughout World war II and the occupation period.

On September 2, Japan formally surrendered with the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. On September 6, US President Harry S. Truman approved a document titled &quot;US Initial Post-Surrender Policy for Japan&quot;. The document set two main objectives for the occupation: (1) eliminating Japan's war potential and (2) turning Japan into a western style nation with pro-American orientation. Allied (primarily American) forces were set up to supervise the country, and &quot;for eighty months following its surrender in 1945, Japan was at the mercy of an army of occupation, its people subject to foreign military control.&quot; At the head of the Occupation administration was General MacArthur who was technically supposed to defer to an advisory council set up by the Allied powers, but in practice did everything himself. As a result, this period was one of significant American influence, having been already identified in 1951, that &quot;for six years the United States has had a freer hand to experiment with Japan than any other country in Asia, or indeed in the entire world.&quot;

MacArthur's first priority was to set up a food distribution network; following the collapse of the ruling government and the wholesale destruction of most major cities, virtually everyone was starving. Even with these measures, millions of people were still on the brink of starvation for several years after the surrender.  As expressed by Kawai Kazuo, &quot;Democracy cannot be taught to a starving people,&quot;

Initially the US government provided emergency food relief through GARIOA funds.  In fiscal year 1946, this aid amounted to US$92 million in loans. From April 1946, in the guise of LARA, private relief organizations were also permitted to provide relief. Once the food network was in place, at a cost of up to US$1 million per day, MacArthur set out to win the support of Hirohito. The two men met for the first time on September 27; the photograph of the two together is one of the most famous in Japanese history. However, many were shocked that MacArthur wore his standard duty uniform with no tie instead of his dress uniform when meeting the emperor. MacArthur may have done this on purpose, to send a message as to what he considered the emperor's status to be. With the sanction of Japan's reigning monarch, MacArthur had the ammunition he needed to begin the real work of the occupation. While other Allied political and military leaders pushed for Hirohito to be tried as a war criminal, MacArthur resisted such calls and rejected the claims of members of the imperial family such as Prince Mikasa and Prince Higashikuni and intellectuals like Tatsuji Miyoshi who asked for the emperor's abdication, arguing that any such prosecution would be overwhelmingly unpopular with the Japanese people.

By the end of 1945, more than 350,000 U.S. personnel were stationed throughout Japan. By the beginning of 1946, replacement troops began to arrive in the country in large numbers and were assigned to MacArthur's Eighth Army, headquartered in Tokyo's Dai-Ichi building. Of the main Japanese islands, Kyūshū was occupied by the 24th Infantry Division, with some responsibility for Shikoku. Honshū was occupied by the First Cavalry Division. Hokkaidō was occupied by the 11th Airborne Division.

The official British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), composed of Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand personnel, was deployed on February 21, 1946. While U.S. forces were responsible for overall military government, BCOF was responsible for supervising demilitarization and the disposal of Japan's war industries. BCOF was also responsible for occupation of several western prefectures and had its headquarters at Kure. At its peak, the force numbered about 40,000 personnel. During 1947, BCOF began to decrease its activities in Japan, and officially wound up in 1951.

==Japanese Reaction to the start of the Occupation==
Hirohito’s surrender broadcast was a shock to Japanese citizens. After years of propaganda which had told them about Japan’s military might and the inevitability of victory, the suddenness of the revelation was a shock. But for many people, these were only secondary concerns since they were also facing starvation and homelessness.

Post-war Japan was chaotic. The air raids on urban centers left millions displaced and food shortages, created by bad harvests and the demands of the war, worsened when the importation of food from Korea, Taiwan, and China ceased. Repatriation of Japanese living in other parts of Asia only aggravated the problems in Japan as these displaced people put more strain on already scarce resources. Over 5.1 million Japanese returned to Japan in the fifteen months following October 1, 1945. Alcohol and drug abuse became major problems. Deep exhaustion, declining morale and despair was so widespread that it was termed the &quot;kyodatsu condition.&quot;  Inflation was rampant and many people turned to the black market for even the most basic goods. Prostitution also increased considerably.

The phrase &quot;shikata ga nai&quot;, or &quot;nothing can be done about it,&quot; was commonly used in both Japanese and American press to encapsulate the Japanese public's resignation to the harsh conditions endured while under occupation. However, not everyone reacted the same way to the hardships of the postwar period. While some succumbed to the difficulties, many more were resilient. As the country regained its footing, they were able to bounce back as well.

==Outcomes of the Occupation==
===Disarmament===
Japan's postwar constitution, adopted under Allied supervision, included a &quot;Peace Clause&quot; (Article 9), which renounced war and banned Japan from maintaining any armed forces. This was intended to prevent the country from ever becoming an aggressive military power again. However, within a decade, America was pressuring Japan to rebuild its army as a bulwark against Communism in Asia after the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War, and Japan established Self-Defense Forces. Traditionally, Japan's military spending has been restricted to about 1% of its GNP though this is by popular practice, not law, and has fluctuated up and down from this figure. Recently, past Prime Ministers Junichiro Koizumi and Shinzo Abe, and other politicians have tried to repeal or amend the clause. Although the intention of the American Occupation was to demilitarize the Japanese, due to the subsequent Asian threat of communism, and at American urging, the Japanese military was slowly restored to considerable strength. Japan currently has the seventh largest military budget in the world.

===Liberalization===
The Occupation was not the simple experiment in democracy it is often portrayed to be. With the intensification of the Cold War, SCAP reined in its reform initiatives. From late 1947, US Priorities shifted perceptibly from liberal social change to internal political stability and economic recovery. Demilitarisation and democratization lost momentum and then seemed to stall. Economic deconcentration, for example, was left uncompleted as GHQ responded to new imperatives. American authorities encouraged business practices and industrial policies that have since become sources of contention between Japan and its major trade partners, notably the United States.&quot; During the Occupation, GHQ/SCAP successfully (if not entirely) abolished many of the financial coalitions known as the Zaibatsu, which had previously monopolized industry. Along with the later American change of heart, however (due in part to the need for an economically stronger Japan in the face of a perceived Soviet threat), these economic reforms were also hampered by the wealthy and influential Japanese who obviously stood to lose a great deal. As such, there were those who consequently resisted any attempts at reform, claiming that the zaibatsu were required for Japan to compete internationally, and looser industrial groupings known as keiretsu evolved. A major land reform was also conducted, led by Wolf Ladejinsky of General Douglas MacArthur's  SCAP staff.  However, Ladejinsky has stated that the real architect of reform was Socialist Hiro Wada, former Japanese Minister of Agriculture. Between 1947 and 1949, approximately 5,800,000 acres of land (23,500 km2)  (approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land) were purchased from the landlords under the government's reform program and resold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power structure that the landlords had long dominated.

===Democratization===
In 1946, the Diet ratified a new Constitution of Japan that followed closely a 'model copy' prepared by the GHQ/SCAP (namely the organization headed by Gen. MacArthur that was responsible for conducting the Occupation), and was promulgated as an amendment to the old Prussian-style Meiji Constitution. &quot;The political project drew much of its inspiration from the US Bill of Rights, New Deal social legislation, the liberal constitutions of several European states and even the Soviet Union... (It) transferred sovereignty from the Emperor to the people in an attempt to depoliticize the Throne and reduce it to the status of a state symbol. Included in the revised charter was the famous 'no war', 'no arms' Article Nine, which outlawed belligerency as an instrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The 1947 Constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.&quot;  On December 15, 1945 the Shinto Directive was issued abolishing Shinto as a state religion and prohibiting some of its teachings and rites that were deemed to be militaristic or ultra-nationalistic. On April 10, 1946, an election that saw 78.52% voter turnout among men and 66.97% among women gave Japan its first modern prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida.

===Trade Union Act===
In 1945 the Diet passed Japan's first ever trade union law protecting the rights of workers to form or join a union, to organize and take industrial action. There had been pre-war attempts to do so, but none that were successfully passed until the Allied occupation. A new Trade Union law was passed on June 1 1949, which remains in place to the present day. According to Article 1 of the Act, the purpose of the act is to &quot;elevate the status of workers by promoting their being on equal standing with the employer&quot;.

===Labor Standards Act=== 
The Labor Standards Act was enacted on 7 April, 1947 to govern working conditions in Japan. According to Article 1 of the Act, it's goal is to ensure that &quot;Working conditions shall be those which should meet the needs of workers who live lives worthy of human beings.&quot; While it was created while Japan was under occupation, the origins of the Act have nothing to do with the occupation forces. It appears to have been the brainchild of Kosaku Teramoto, a former member of the Thought Police, who had become the head of the Labor Standards section of the Welfare Ministry.

===Education reform===
Before and during the war, Japanese education was based on the German system, with &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (selective grammar schools) and universities to train students after primary school. During the occupation, Japan's secondary education system was changed to incorporate three-year junior high schools and senior high schools similar to those in the U.S.: junior high became compulsory but senior high remained optional. The Imperial Rescript on Education was repealed, and the Imperial University system reorganized. The longstanding issue of Japanese script reform, which had been planned for decades but continuously opposed by more conservative elements, was also resolved during this time. The Japanese written system was drastically reorganized with the Tōyō kanji-list in 1946, predecessor of today's Jōyō kanji, and orthography was greatly altered to reflect spoken usage.

==Negative impacts of the occupation==
===Purging of war criminals===
While these other reforms were taking place, various military tribunals, most notably the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Ichigaya, were trying Japan's war criminals and sentencing many to death and imprisonment. However, many suspects such as Tsuji Masanobu, Nobusuke Kishi, Yoshio Kodama and Ryoichi Sasakawa were never judged, while the Showa Emperor, all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as Prince Chichibu, Prince Asaka, Prince Hiroyasu Fushimi, Prince Higashikuni and Prince Takeda, and all members of Unit 731 were given immunity from criminal prosecution by General MacArthur.

Before the war crimes trials actually convened, the SCAP, the IPS and Shōwa officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the imperial family from being indicted, but also to slant the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the Emperor. High officials in court circles and the Shōwa government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals, while the individuals arrested as ''Class A'' suspects and incarcerated in Sugamo prison solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility. Thus, &quot;months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur's highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for Pearl Harbor to Hideki Tōjō&quot; by allowing &quot;the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.&quot;

For historian John W. Dower, &quot;Even Japanese peace activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters, and who have labored to document and publicize Japanese atrocities, cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of Cold war, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-wing war criminals like the later prime minister Kishi Nobusuke&quot;.

In retrospect, apart from the military officer corps, the purge of alleged militarists and ultranationalists that was conducted under the Occupation had relatively small impact on the long-term composition of men of influence in the public and private sectors. The purge initially brought new blood into the political parties, but this was offset by the return of huge numbers of formally purged conservative politicians to national as well as local politics in the early 1950s. In the bureaucracy, the purge was negligible from the outset... In the economic sector, the purge similarly was only mildly disruptive, affecting less than sixteen hundred individuals spread among some four hundred companies. Everywhere one looks, the corridors of power in postwar Japan are crowded with men whose talents had already been recognized during the war years, and who found the same talents highly prized in the &quot;new&quot; Japan.

===Rape===
While many Japanese civilians feared that the Allied troops were likely to rape Japanese women, the incidence of rape committed by members of the occupation force was low. Its incidence did increase after the criminalization of prostitution, however. Michael S. Molasky reports that while rape and other violent crime was widespread in naval ports like Yokosuka and Yokohama during the first few weeks of occupation, according to Japanese police reports, the number of incidents declined shortly after and were not common on mainland Japan throughout the rest of occupation.

According to Toshiyuki Tanaka, 76 cases of rape or rape-murder were reported on Okinawa during the first five years of occupation. However, this is probably not the true figure, as most cases went unreported.

===Censorship===
After the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers abolished all forms of censorship and controls on Freedom of Speech, which was also integrated into Article 21 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. However, press censorship remained a reality in the post-war era, especially in matters of pornography, and in political matters deemed subversive by the American government during the occupation of Japan.

The Allied occupation forces suppressed news of criminal activities such as rape; on September 10, 1945 SCAP &quot;issued press and pre-censorship codes outlawing the publication of all reports and statistics 'inimical to the objectives of the Occupation'.&quot;

===Comfort women===
With the acceptance of the Allied occupation authorities the Japanese organized a brothel system for the benefit of the more than 300,000 occupation troops. &quot;The strategy was, through the special work of experienced women, to create a breakwater to protect regular women and girls.&quot;

In December 1945 a senior officer with the Public Health and Welfare Division of the occupation's General Headquarters wrote regarding the typical prostitute:
:&quot;The girl is impressed into contracting by the desperate financial straits of her parents and their urging, occasionally supplemented by her willingness to make such a sacrifice to help her family,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It is the belief of our informants, however, that in urban districts the practice of enslaving girls, while much less prevalent than in the past, still exists.&quot;

&quot;The worst victims ... were the women who, with no previous experience, answered the ads calling for 'Women of the New Japan,&quot;'

When MacArthur finally closed the brothels on March 25, 1946, it is estimated that more than 25% of the U.S. troops had sexually transmitted diseases.

===Industrial disarmament===
To further remove Japan as a potential future threat to the U.S., the Far Eastern Commission decided that Japan was to be partly de-industrialized. The necessary dismantling of Japanese industry was foreseen to have been achieved when Japanese standards of living had been reduced to those existing in Japan the period 1930 - 1934. In the end the adopted program of de-industrialisation in Japan was implemented to a lesser degree than the similar U.S. &quot;industrial disarmament&quot; program in Germany. In view of the cost to American taxpayers for emergency food aid to Japan, in April 1948 the Johnston Committee Report recommended that the economy of Japan should instead be reconstructed. The report included suggestions for reductions in war reparations, and a relaxation of the &quot;economic deconcentration&quot; policy. For the fiscal year of 1949 funds were moved from the GARIOA budget into an Economic Rehabilitation in Occupied Areas (EROA) programme, to be used for the import of materials needed for economic reconstruction.

===Expulsions===
The defeat of the Japanese Empire meant reversal of its previous annexations-Taiwan and Manchuria returned to China, while Korea regained its independence.

The Soviet Union claimed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, with 400,000 Japanese fleeing or expelled. Similar actions happened in Taiwan and Manchuria after their return to China, while independent Korea saw flight of over 800,000 Japanese settlers—fearing reprisals for Japanese war crimes and decades of looting of the peninsula by settlers.

===Soviet Attacks===
In a bid to occupy as much Japanese territory as possible, Soviet troops continued offensive military operations after the Japanese surrender, causing large scale civilian casualties.

==Politics==
Unlike the case in Germany Japan retained a native government throughout the occupation, although its ''de facto'' authority was strictly limited at first and senior figures in the government such as the Prime Minister effectively served at the leisure of the occupational authorities prior to the first post-war elections being held.

Political parties had begun to revive almost immediately after the occupation began. Left-wing organizations, such as the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party, having being banned by the Fascists, quickly reestablished themselves, as did various conservative parties. The old Seiyukai and Rikken Minseito came back as, respectively, the Liberal Party (Nihon Jiyuto) and the Japan Progressive Party (Nihon Shimpoto). The first postwar elections were held in 1946 (women were given the franchise for the first time), and the Liberal Party's vice president, Yoshida Shigeru (1878–1967), became prime minister. For the 1947 elections, anti-Yoshida forces left the Liberal Party and joined forces with the Progressive Party to establish the new Japan Democratic Party (Minshuto). This divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality to the Japan Socialist Party, which was allowed to form a cabinet, which lasted less than a year. Thereafter, the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral successes. After a short period of Democratic Party administration, Yoshida returned in late 1948 and continued to serve as prime minister until 1954. However, because of a heart failure Yoshida was replaced by Shinto in 1955.

==End of the occupation==
In 1949, MacArthur made a sweeping change in the SCAP power structure that greatly increased the power of Japan's native rulers, and the occupation began to draw to a close.  The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, marked the end of the Allied occupation, and when it went into effect on April 28, 1952, Japan was once again an independent state (with the exceptions of Okinawa, which remained under U.S. control until 1972, and Iwo Jima, which remained under US control until 1968). Even though some 31,000 U.S. military personnel remain in Japan today, they are there at the invitation of the Japanese government under the terms of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan (1960) and not as an occupying force.

      <comment>/* Unification of Japan */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Sengoku period (戦国時代 Sengoku Jidai) or Warring States period in Japanese history was a time of social upheaval, political intrigue, and nearly constant military conflict that lasted roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century. The name &quot;Sengoku&quot; was adopted by Japanese historians in reference to the Warring States period in Chinese history  which preceded the unification of China. Likewise, the Sengoku period in Japan would eventually lead to the unification of political power under the Tokugawa shogunate.
Although the Ashikaga shogunate had retained the structure of the Kamakura bakufu and instituted a warrior government based on the same social economic rights and obligations established by the Hōjō with the Jōei Code in 1232, it failed to win the loyalty of many daimyo, especially those whose domains were far from Kyoto. As trade with China grew, the economy developed, and the use of money became widespread as markets and commercial cities appeared. This, combined with developments in agriculture and small-scale trading, led to the desire for greater local autonomy throughout all levels of the social hierarchy. As early as the beginning of the 15th century, suffering and misery caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes and famines often served to trigger armed uprisings by farmers weary of debt and taxes.
The Ōnin War (1467–1477), a conflict rooted in economic distress and brought on by a dispute over shogunal succession, is generally regarded as the onset of the Sengoku period. The &quot;eastern&quot; army of the Hosokawa family and its allies clashed with the &quot;western&quot; army of the Yamana, and fighting in and around Kyoto lasted for nearly 11 years, after which it spread to outlying provinces.

==Gekokujō==
The upheaval resulted in the further weakening of central authority, and throughout Japan regional lords, or daimyo, rose to fill the vacuum. In the course of this power shift, well established clans such as the Takeda and the Imagawa, who had ruled under the authority of both the Kamakura and Muromachi bakufu, were able to expand their spheres of influence. There were many, however, whose positions eroded and were eventually usurped by more capable underlings. This phenomenon of social meritocracy, in which capable subordinates rejected the status quo and forcefully overthrew an emaciated aristocracy became known as gekokujō (下克上?), which literally means &quot;the underling conquers the overlord.&quot; One of the earliest instances of this phenomenon was Hōjō Sōun, who rose from relatively humble origins and eventually seized power in Izu province in 1493. Building on the accomplishments of Sōun, the Late Hōjō clan remained a major power in the Kantō region until its subjugation by Toyotomi Hideyoshi late in the Sengoku period. Other notable examples include the supplanting of the Hosokawa clan by the Miyoshi, the Shiba clan by the Oda clan, and the Toki by the Saito.
Well organized religious groups also gained political power at this time by uniting farmers in resistance and rebellion against the rule of the daimyo. The monks of the Buddhist True Pure Land sect formed numerous Ikkō-ikki, the most successful of which, in Kaga Province, remained independent for nearly 100 years.

==The Rise of Oda Nobunaga==
[[File:odanobunaga.jpg|thumb|300px|Oda Nobunaga]]
During the last half of the 16th century, a number of different daimyo became strong enough either to manipulate the Muromachi bakufu to their own advantage or to overthrow it altogether. One attempt to overthrow the bakufu was made in 1560 by Imagawa Yoshimoto, whose march towards the capital came to an ignominious end at the hands of Oda Nobunaga in the Battle of Okehazama. In 1562, The Tokugawa clan who was adjacent to the east of Nobunaga's territory became independent of the Imagawa clan, and allied with Nobunaga. The eastern part of the territory of Nobunaga was not invaded by this alliance. And, he moves the army to the west. In 1565, an alliance of the Matsunaga and Miyoshi clans attempted a coup by assassinating Ashikaga Yoshiteru, the 13th Ashikaga shogun. Internal squabbling, however, prevented them from acting swiftly to legitimatize their claim to power, and it was not until 1568 that they managed to install Yoshiteru's cousin, Ashikaga Yoshihide, as the next Shogun. Failure to enter Kyoto and gain recognition from the imperial court, however, had left the succession in doubt, and a group of bakufu retainers led by Hosokawa Fujitaka negotiated with Nobunaga to gain support for Yoshiteru's younger brother, Yoshiaki.

Nobunaga, who had prepared over a period of years for just such an opportunity by establishing an alliance with the Asai clan in northern Ōmi Province and then conquering the neighboring province of Mino Province, now marched toward Kyoto. After routing the Rokkaku clan in southern Omi, Nobunaga forced the Matsunaga to capitulate and the Miyoshi to withdraw to Settsu. He then entered the capital, where he successfully gained recognition from the emperor for Yoshiaki, who became the 15th Ashikaga shogun.

Nobunaga had no intention, however, of serving the Muromachi bakufu, and instead now turned his attention to tightening his grip on the Kansai region. Resistance in the form of rival daimyo, intransigent Buddhist monks, and hostile merchants was eliminated swiftly and mercilessly, and Nobunaga quickly gained a reputation as a ruthless, unrelenting adversary. In support of his political and military moves, he instituted economic reform, removing barriers to commerce by invalidating traditional monopolies held by shrines and guilds and promoting initiative by instituting free markets known as rakuichi-rakuza.

By 1573 he had destroyed the alliance of Asakura clan and Azai clans that threatened his northern flank, obliterated the militant Tendai Buddhists monastic center at Mount Hiei near Kyoto, and also had managed to avoid a potentially debilitating confrontation with Takeda Shingen, who had suddenly taken ill and died just as his army was on the verge of defeating the Tokugawa and invading Oda's domain on its way to Kyoto.

Even after Shingen's death, there remained several daimyo powerful enough to resist Nobunaga, but none were situated close enough to Kyoto to pose a threat politically, and it appeared that unification under the Oda banner was a matter of time.

Nobunaga's enemies were not only other Sengoku daimyō but also adherents of a Jōdo Shinshu sect of Buddhism who attended Ikkō-ikki. Their leader was Kennyo. He endured though Nobunaga kept attacking his fortress for ten years. Nobunaga expelled Kennyo in the eleventh year, but, by a riot caused by Kennyo, Nobunaga's territory took the big damage. This long war was called Ishiyama Hongan-ji War.

To suppress the Buddhism, Nobunaga supported Christianity. And, a lot of cultures were introduced to Japan by the missionary from Europe. Those things include new foods, new drawing methods, astronomy, geography, medical science, and new printing techniques.

==Unification of Japan==
After nearly a century and a half of political instability and warfare, Japan was on the verge of unification by Oda Nobunaga, who had emerged from obscurity in the province of Owari (present-day Aichi Prefecture) to dominate central Japan, when in 1582 Nobunaga himself fell victim to the treachery of one of his own generals, Akechi Mitsuhide. This in turn provided Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who had risen through the ranks from ashigaru (footsoldier) to become one of Nobunaga's most trusted generals, with the opportunity to establish himself as Nobunaga's successor. Hideyoshi eventually consolidated his control over the remaining daimyo and, although he was ineligible for the title of Seii Taishogun because of his common birth, ruled as Kampaku.  
When, in 1598, Hideyoshi died without leaving a capable successor, the country was once again thrust into political turmoil, and this time it was Tokugawa Ieyasu who took advantage of the opportunity. This topic will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Compton-effekt1.png|thumb|150px|The Compton effect]]

We covered the interaction of gamma-rays with matter from a descriptive viewpoint in the [[../Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter|previous chapter]] and we saw that the Compton and Photoelectric Effects were the major mechanisms.  We will consider the subject again here but this time from an analytical perspective.  This will allow us to develop a more general understanding of the phenomenon.

Note that the treatment here also refers to the attenuation of X-rays since, as we noted before gamma-rays and X-rays are essentially the same physical entities.

Our treatment begins with a description of a simple radiation experiment which can be performed easily in the laboratory and which many of the early pioneers in this field did.  We will then build on the information obtained from such an experiment to develop a simple equation and some simple concepts which will allow us generalise the situation to any attenuation situation.

== Attenuation Experiment ==

The experiment is quite simple.  It involves firing a narrow beam of gamma-rays at a material and measuring how much of the radiation gets through.  We can vary the energy of the gamma-rays we use and the type of absorbing material as well as its thickness and density.  

The experimental set-up is illustrated in the figure below.  We refer to the intensity of the radiation which strikes the absorber as the '''incident intensity''', ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the intensity of the radiation which gets through the absorber as the '''transmitted intensity''', ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Notice also that the thickness of the absorber is denoted by ''x''.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM7_1.gif|320px]]&lt;/center&gt;

From what we covered in the [[../Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter|previous chapter]] we can appreciate that some of the gamma-rays will be subjected to interactions such as the Photoelectric Effect and the Compton Effect as they pass through the absorber.  The transmitted gamma-rays will in the main be those which pass through without any interactions at all.

We can therefore expect to find that the transmitted intensity will be less than the incident intensity, that is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x &lt; I_0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

But by how much you might ask.  Before we consider this let us denote the difference between ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as ∆''I'', that is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta I = I_0 - I_x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

==== Effect of Atomic Number ====

:Let us start exploring the magnitude of ∆''I'' by placing different absorbers in turn in the radiation beam.  What we would find is that the magnitude of ∆''I'' is highly dependent on the atomic number of the absorbing material.  For example we would find that ∆''I'' would be quite low in the case of an absorber made from [[W:Carbon|carbon]] (''Z''=6) and very large in the case of [[W:Lead|lead]] (''Z''=82).

:We can gain an appreciation of why this is so from the following figure:

[[Image:NM7_5.gif|center|220px]]

:The figure illustrates a high atomic number absorber by the large circles which represent individual atoms and a low atomic number material by smaller circles.  The incident radiation beam is represented by the arrows entering each absorber from the left.  Notice that the atoms of the high atomic number absorber present larger targets for the radiation to strike and hence the chances for interactions via the Photoelectric and Compton Effects is relatively high.  The attenuation should therefore be relatively large.

:In the case of the low atomic number absorber however the individual atoms are smaller and hence the chances of interactions are reduced.  In other words the radiation has a greater probability of being transmitted through the absorber and the attenuation is consequently lower than in the high atomic number case.

:With respect to our spaceship analogy used in the [[../Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter|previous chapter]] the atomic number can be thought of as the size of individual meteors in the meteor cloud.

:If we were to precisely control our experimental set-up and carefully analyse our results we would find that:&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta I \propto Z^3\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


:Therefore if we were to double the atomic number of our absorber we would increase the attenuation by a factor of two cubed, that is 8, if we were to triple the atomic number we would increase the attenuation by a factor of 27, that is three cubed, and so on.

:It is for this reason that high atomic number materials (e.g. Pb) are used for radiation protection.

==== Effect of Density ====

:A second approach to exploring the magnitude of ∆I is to see what happens when we change the density of the absorber.  We can see from the following figure that a low density absorber will give rise to less attenuation than a high density absorber since the chances of an interaction between the radiation and the atoms of the absorber are relatively lower.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM7_6.gif|center|220px]]&lt;/center&gt;

:So in our analogy of the spaceship entering a meteor cloud think of meteor clouds of different density and the chances of the spaceship colliding with a meteor.

==== Effect of Thickness ====

:A third factor which we could vary is the thickness of the absorber.  As you should be able to predict at this stage the thicker the absorber the greater the attenuation.

==== Effect of Gamma-Ray Energy ====

:Finally in our experiment we could vary the energy of the gamma-ray beam.  We would find without going into it in any great detail that the greater the energy of the gamma-rays the less the attenuation.  You might like to think of it in terms of the energy with which the spaceship approaches the meteor cloud and the likelihood of a slow spaceship getting through as opposed to a spaceship travelling with a higher energy.

== Mathematical Model ==

We will consider a mathematical model here which will help us to express our experimental observations in more general terms.  You will find that the mathematical approach adopted and the result obtained is quite similar to what we encountered earlier with [[../The_Radioactive_Decay_Law|Radioactive Decay]].  So you will not have to plod your way through any new maths below, just a different application of the same form of mathematical analysis!

Let us start quite simply and assume that we vary only the thickness of the absorber.  In other words we use an absorber of the same material (i.e. same atomic number) and the same density and use gamma-rays of the same energy for the experiment.  Only the thickness of the absorber is changed.

From our reasoning above it is easy to appreciate that the magnitude of ∆''I'' should be dependent on the radiation intensity as well as the thickness of the absorber, that is for an infinitesimally small change in absorber thickness:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-d I \propto I \cdot dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

the minus sign indicating that the intensity is reduced by the absorber.

Turning the proportionality in this equation into an equality, we can write:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-d I = \mu I \cdot dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where the constant of proportionality, &amp;mu;, is called the [[W:Linear_attenuation_coefficient|Linear Attenuation Coefficient]].

Dividing across by ''I'' we can rewrite this equation as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\frac{d I}{I} = \mu \cdot dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So this equation describes the situation for any tiny change in absorber thickness, ''dx''.  To find out what happens for the complete thickness of an absorber we simply add up what happens in each small thickness.  In other words we integrate the above equation.  Expressing this more formally we can say that for thicknesses from ''x'' = 0 to any other thickness ''x'', the radiation intensity will decrease from ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;- \int_{I_0}^{I_x} \frac{dI}{I} = \mu \int_{0}^x dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \ln \left ( \frac{I_x}{I_0} \right ) = -\mu x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \frac{I_x}{I_0} = \text{exp}\ (-\mu x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore I_x = I_0\ \text{exp}\ (-\mu x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This final expression tells us that the radiation intensity will decrease in an exponential fashion with the thickness of the absorber with the rate of decrease being controlled by the Linear Attenuation Coefficient.  The expression is shown in graphical form below.  The graph plots the intensity against thickness, ''x''.  We can see that the intensity decreases from ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, that is the number at ''x'' = 0, in a rapid fashion initially and then more slowly in the classic exponential manner.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The influence of the Linear Attenuation Coefficient can be seen in the next figure.  All three curves here are exponential in nature, only the Linear Attenuation Coefficient is different.  Notice that when the Linear Attenuation Coefficient has a low value the curve decreases relatively slowly and when the Linear Attenuation Coefficient is large the curve decreases very quickly.

[[Image:NM7_16.gif|center|thumb|Exponential attenuation expressed using a small, medium and large value of the Linear Attenuation Coefficient, µ.]]

The Linear Attenuation Coefficient is characteristic of individual absorbing materials.  Some like carbon have a small value and are easily penetrated by gamma-rays.  Other materials such as lead have a relatively large Linear Attenuation Coefficient and are relatively good absorbers of radiation:

|-
| '''Carbon''' || 0.335 || 0.274 || 0.196

|-
| '''Copper''' || 3.8 || 1.309 || 0.73
|-
| '''Lead''' || 59.7 || 10.15 || 1.64
|}

The materials listed in the table above are air, water and a range of elements from carbon (''Z''=6) through to lead (''Z''=82) and their Linear Attenuation Coefficients are given for three gamma-ray energies.  The first point to note is that the Linear Attenuation Coefficient increases as the atomic number of the absorber increases.  For example it increases from a very small value of 0.000195 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for air at 100 keV to almost 60 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for lead.  The second point to note is that the Linear Attenuation Coefficient for all materials decreases with the energy of the gamma-rays.  For example the value for copper decreases from about 3.8 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 100 keV to 0.73 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 500 keV.  The third point to note is that the trends in the table are consistent with the analysis presented earlier.

Finally it is important to appreciate that our analysis above is only strictly true when we are dealing with narrow radiation beams.  Other factors need to be taken into account when broad radiation beams are involved.

== Half Value Layer ==
As with using the Half Life to describe the [[../The_Radioactive_Decay_Law|Radioactive Decay Law]] an indicator is usually derived from the exponential attenuation equation above which helps us think more clearly about what is going on.  This indicator is called the '''Half Value Layer''' and it expresses the thickness of absorbing material which is needed to reduce the incident radiation intensity by a factor of two.  From a graphical point of view we can say that when:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = \frac{I_0}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

the thickness of absorber is the Half Value Layer:

[[Image:NM7_19.gif|center|320px]]

The Half Value Layer for a range of absorbers is listed in the following table for three gamma-ray energies:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; margin:0px auto;&quot;

! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 200 keV
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | 500 keV
|-
| '''Air''' || 3555 || 4359 || 6189

| '''Water''' || 4.15 || 5.1 || 7.15

|-
| '''Copper''' || 0.18 || 0.53 || 0.95
|-
| '''Lead''' || 0.012 || 0.068 || 0.42
|}

The first point to note is that the Half Value Layer decreases as the atomic number increases.  For example the value for air at 100 keV is about 35 meters and it decreases to just 0.12 mm for lead at this energy.  In other words 35 m of air is needed to reduce the intensity of a 100 keV gamma-ray beam by a factor of two whereas just 0.12 mm of lead can do the same thing.  The second thing to note is that the Half Value Layer increases with increasing gamma-ray energy.  For example from 0.18 cm for copper at 100 keV to about 1 cm at 500 keV.  Thirdly note that relative to the data in the previous table there is a reciprocal relationship between the Half Value Layer and the Linear Attenuation Coefficient, which we will now investigate.

== Relationship between &amp;mu; and the HVL ==

As was the case with the Radioactive Decay Law, where we explored the relationship between the Half Life and the Decay Constant, a relationship can be derived between the Half Value Layer and the Linear Attenuation Coefficient.  We can do this by using the definition of the Half Value Layer:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = \frac{I_0}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

when

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x = x_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and inserting it in the exponential attenuation equation, that is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_0\ \text{exp}\ (-\mu x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

to give

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{I_0}{2} = I\ \text{exp}\ (-\mu x_{\frac{1}{2}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Therefore

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = \text{exp}\ (-\mu x_{\frac{1}{2}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore 2^{-1} = \text{exp}\ (-\mu x_{\frac{1}{2}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \ln 2^{-1} = -\mu x_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore \ln 2 = \mu x_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore 0.693 = \mu x_{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{0.693}{x_{\frac{1}{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x_{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{0.693}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

These last two equations express the relationship between the Linear Attenuation Coefficient and the Half Value Layer.  They are very useful as you will see when solving numerical questions relating to attenuation and frequently form the first step in solving a numerical problem.

== Mass Attenuation Coefficient ==
We implied above that the Linear Attenuation Coefficient was useful when we were considering an absorbing material of the same density but of different thicknesses.  A related coefficient can be of value when we wish to include the density, &amp;rho;, of the absorber in our analysis.  This is the '''Mass Attenuation Coefficient''' which is defined as the:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{Linear Attenuation Coefficient}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{\mu}{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The measurement unit used for the Linear Attenuation Coefficient in the table above is cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a common unit of density is the g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.  You might like to derive for yourself on this basis that the cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is the equivalent unit of the Mass Attenuation Coefficient.

== Questions ==

Two questions are given below to help you develop your understanding of the material presented in this chapter.  The first one is relatively straight-forward and will exercise your application of the exponential attenuation equation.  The second question is a lot more challenging and will help you relate exponential attenuation to radioactivity and radiation exposure. 

'''Question 1'''

How much aluminium is required to reduce the intensity of a 200 keV gamma-ray beam to 10% of its incident intensity?  Assume that the Half Value Layer for 200 keV gamma-rays in Al is 2.14 cm.

'''Answer'''

:The question phrased in terms of the symbols used above is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = \frac{I_0}{10},\ \text{when}\ x = \text{?}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:We are told that the Half Value Layer is 2.14 cm.  Therefore the Linear Attenuation Coefficient is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{0.693}{x_{\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{0.693}{2.14} = 0.324\ \text{cm}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Now combining all this with the exponential attenuation equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;I_x = I_0\ \text{exp}\ (-\mu x)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:we can write:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{I_0}{10} = I_0\ \text{exp}\ (-0.324x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:Therefore

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{10} = \text{exp}\ (-0.324x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore -\ln 10 = -0.324x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore x = \frac{\ln 10}{0.324} = \frac{2.3}{0.324} = 7.1\ \text{cm}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore x \approx 7\ \text{cm}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:So the thickness of aluminium required to reduce these gamma-rays by a factor of ten is about 7 cm.  This relatively large thickness is the reason why aluminium is not generally used in radiation protection - its atomic number is not high enough for efficient and significant attenuation of gamma-rays.  

:You might like to try this question for the case when Pb is the absorber - but you will need to find out the Half Value Layer for the 200 keV gamma-rays yourself!  

:Here's a hint though:  have a look at one of the tables above.  

:And here's the answer for you to check when you've finished:  &lt;b&gt;2.2 mm&lt;/b&gt;.  

:In other words a relatively thin thickness of Pb is required to do the same job as 7 cm of aluminium.

'''Question 2'''

A 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MBq source of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is to be contained in a Pb box so that the exposure rate 1 m away from the source is less than 0.5 mR/hour.  If the Half Value Layer for &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs gamma-rays in Pb is 0.6 cm, what thickness of Pb is required?  The Specific Gamma Ray Constant for &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is 3.3 R hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mCi&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 cm.

'''Answer'''

:This is a fairly typical question which arises when someone is using radioactive materials.  We wish to use a certain quantity of the material and we wish to store it in a lead container so that the exposure rate when we are working a certain distance away is below some level for safety reasons.  We know the radioactivity of the material we will be using.  But its quoted in SI units.  We look up a reference book to find out the exposure rate for this radioisotope and find that the Specific Gamma Ray Constant is quoted in traditional units.  Just as in our question!

:So let us start by getting our units right.  The Specific Gamma Ray Constant is given as:

&lt;center&gt;3.3 R hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mCi&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 cm from the source.&lt;/center&gt;  

:This is equal to:

&lt;center&gt;3300 mR hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mCi&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 cm from the source,&lt;/center&gt;

:which is equal to:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{3300}{(100)^2}\ \text{mR hr}^{-1}\ \text{mCi}^{-1}\ \text{at 1 m from the source}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:on the basis of the Inverse Square Law.  This result expressed per becquerel is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{3300}{10^4 (3.7 \cdot 10^7)}\ \text{mR hr}^{-1}\ \text{Bq}^{-1}\ \text{at 1 m from the source}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:since 1 mCi = 3.7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; Bq.  And therefore for 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; MBq, the exposure rate is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{3300 \cdot 10^5 \cdot 10^6}{10^4 (3.7 \cdot 10^7)}\ \text{mR hr}^{-1}\ (10^5\ \text{MBq})^{-1}\ \text{at 1 m from the source}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

:That is the exposure rate 1 meter from our source is &lt;b&gt;891.9 mR hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.

:We wish to reduce this exposure rate according to the question to less than 0.5 mR hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; using Pb.

:You should be able at this stage to use the exponential attenuation equation along with the Half Value Layer for these gamma-rays in Pb to calculate that the thickness of Pb required is about &lt;b&gt;6.5 cm&lt;/b&gt;.

== Creating account does not work ==

When trying to create an account the picture wouldn't show up blocking me from creating the account. In other wikis this is no problem. I use Firefox 1501, several extensions which work perfectly well with other wikis. Java/script are on.

-- [[User:Hvezd|Hvezd]] 09:12, 2006-04-29 (UTC)

: Can you try again at [[Special:Userlogin]]? From my copy of (outdated) Firefox 1.0.6, I was able to see image.

: Of course, check that you did not tell Firefox to block images from en.wikibooks.org. (Most of the images on this site are from upload.wikimedia.org, so you would still be able to see them.) Right-click the words-image and make sure &quot;Block images from en.wikibooks.org&quot; is '''not''' checked. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 08:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

Thanks. I never blocked any file of any wiki-site. I created accounts in other wikis before without any problem. I could create an account in wikibooks via IE. Firefox showed the missing picture file in other wikis, just not in wikibooks. Now, 3 days later, it works again. No idea why.

==Sidebar==

I've been bold and tried to improve the sidebar. Unfortunately, for some reason I can't fathom, the two items under &quot;search&quot; appear out of kilter. The page that feeds into the sidebar is [[MediaWiki:Sidebar]]. If anyone can see what's wrong please let me know (the page is protected so only admins can edit it). Of course, if you have ideas for improvements yourself, let us know too:) [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:12, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

: This shows that [[m:Be bold]] should apply to &quot;MediaWiki:&quot; pages even though only [[Wikibooks:administrators|administrators]] can edit those.

: The problem with &quot;search&quot; was that the text was centered. This is because both the &quot;search&quot; (By subject, Alphabetically) and &quot;search&quot; (text field, Go button, Search button) sections are &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;portlet&quot; id=&quot;p-search&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in the HTML. The stylesheet centers the second &quot;search&quot; section, and thus also the first. I believe that I fixed the problem by changing &quot;search&quot; to &quot;books&quot;. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 08:02, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

I would like to rename this book to something that is more concise, and would be easier to find.

I would certainly appreciate any suggestions that anybody has  on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:10, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

:That still seems too long a title. Maybe i'm just being unnecessarily picky, however. I just want something that will be easy to find in the &quot;search box&quot; by newcomers, although maybe this subject doesn't lend itself easily to that. Since this is on the &quot;How-to bookshelf&quot;, I'm thinking we can go with the general scheme of things over there and imply the title with How-To: &quot;Get a Job&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]])([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:05, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

::: Most titles on Wikibooks are actually short. We have many one-word titles like [[Calculus]]? [[Feminism]]? I suggest longer titles. With very long titles, one can attempt shorthand, as in [[Guide to Unix]] for &quot;Wikibooks Guide to Unix Computing&quot;. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:31, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

== Why [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing]] was deleted? ==

As you can see, this page was deleted [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Talk%3AAda+Programming%2FContributing] with the unique comment of &quot;There is no module&quot;. I think this page does not qualify as a speedy deletion. This one was a page with metainformation about the [[Ada Programming]] book targeted to the contributors. I guess it was deleted because there was not a corresponding module page, but a deletion of useful content without warning is a bit aggressive behaivour. Please, could some administrator undelete it? On the other hand, is there an appropiate space for metainformation about a book? We discussed that topic in [[Talk:Ada_Programming/Contributors_lounge]] and then we moved the page, that previously was in the main namespace [[Ada Programming/Contributing]], to the talk namespace. I didn't feel totally satisfied, but never thought a useful talk page would be deleted only because there was not a correspondent content page. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 12:12, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

: The book contributors should be able to choose whatever forum they like to discuss the project as a whole. The cookbook uses [[Talk:Cookbook]] as a sort of staff lounge, but we also have [[Cookbook:Policy]] for defining contributing guidelines. An admin should undelete the page.

== Recruiting Contributors ==

I have been working on a very ambitious Wikibook [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book|project]] since October, and have so far attracted two contributors.  One of them has disappeared, and I expect the second one to disappear soon because the module for which he has expertise is nearly complete.

I have been trying to attract more contributors from the community at which this work is directed, but so far, I have had little success.  So now I have an idea that I'd like to get some feedback on.

I would like to have custom lapel pins made for Wikibook contributors.  Contribute to &quot;my&quot; book, and I'll send a free pin.  Unfortunately, it looks like the minimum order is 50 or 100, depending on who you go to, and then the price for the whole lot runs from between $170 to $250 (US).  First, I surely am not going to need anywhere near 50 pins - 5 or 10 is probably more like it.  Also, I am unwilling to devote my financial resources to something that has a risky return (pins might not attract contributors).  

However, if the pin design were a generic Wikibooks design, then I can imagine that the risk (and cost) could be shared by many Wikibookians.  The most promising supplier looks to me like it might be [http://4lapelpins.com| these guys] (no minimum order, but the difference between 20 pins and 50 pins is very small).  I have no affiliation with them, and found them via Google.  

Is anyone interested in something like that?  Maybe the Foundation could have a couple hundred of them made and sell them in onesies and twosies for a small profit.  Thoughts?

[[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 00:27, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

: I doubt wikimedia would be up for this, and I don't know that it'd actually encourage people to stick around or even to contribute in the first place, but it might be fun. You're looking at lapel pins, which are quite expensive as they are produced from custom-made diess. If you looked instead at 1-inch buttons (think punk kids), you would find the price to be way more reasonable and maybe even something you might feel comfortable bankrolling for your book in particular.

It wouldn't be particularly difficult to sell a Wikibooks logo-stamped button through CafePress, so I suggest you e-mail wikipedia@cafepress.com if that's what you would like.

== please help ==

I have been blocked by inshanee on charges that are wholly trumped up and false.
 in fact, i am working on the very issue myself; i was blocked for alleged &quot;attacks&quot;.
Everything i have said is cogently factual, and thus, not an attack, with a single possible
exception being a vote i made.

Even there, i could provide logic to show that in fact, i am just making a cogent observation.

The truth is that this is a pov warrior event and inshanee is abusing his admin priveledge.

I am working on the problem of personal attacks, in fact, and this is one reason why i am being targeted. Inshanee and strotha both like to use sly attacks, and then pounce on you when you defend yourself. My version of reality being the cogent analysis and recognition of this tactic
puts them in a hard spot where they would not be able to use  the method if i can get the problem resolved.

what follows is what blocking me kept me from posting in response to the &quot;personal attacks&quot;
topic posted on Jimbos talk page.
------------
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 19:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
Actually, thats a slippery slope, a hyperbole, and, its untrue.
Using logic, we can discern between attacks and useful conversation about people.
More importantly, right now Wikipedia has become an ad hominem fest. In fact, wikipedia
has become extremely abusive, thanks to no clear means to deal with the abusiveness.
This is a circular problem in that people with expertise won't participate if they can tell
just by browsing the talk pages that its psychological mob warfare defending VS the ignorant to bother to try. For example; I'm not adding any material regarding Psychonautics. I might just be one of the worlds foremost experts on the topic, having managed to obtain waking Theta states in both myself and others. The topic is allready controversial amongst the well educated.
Add to this the inevitable problem of facing down an ignorant mob as soon as you say something
the thought police finds dangerous to maintaining ignorance, and you have a formulae for abuse.
IF logic and cogency were the dominant paradigm on Wikipedia, then experts might feel safe to come here and contribute. All of the sciences at advanced levels become politically inconvenient
for the dominant religious and political paradigms. Those paradigms can only continue to exist
via the vaccum created by intentional ignorance. Ignorance is maintained via anti intellectual
pack psychology. And right now, Wikipedia as a form of government falls easilly into the category &quot;pack psychology driven MOB&quot;.

THE ONLY way to fix this is to make real changes in policy and methods of enforcement regarding
personal attacks. (And other considerations of logic, including straw man arguments and false dillemmas.)
[[User:Prometheuspan|Prometheuspan]] 19:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

Now, I am getting really sick of being gamed and played by abusive people here, and my next step is to start taking my complaints to people who will listen. Wikiwatch has allready featured
me. For instance.

I am trying to resolve these problems, and these people are being patently abusive.

If these problems can't be resolved, then it seems that i will be forced to leave wikibooks
and wikipedia, and to make certain that the world knows that wikipedia is an extremely abusive
place.

: (Trying to be helpful) I have no idea what you're talking about here. You have given insufficient context. Your formatting is also a serious problem that is inhibiting communication; try to write in paragraphs containing one or more sentences, try '''not''' using breaks (instead, use indentation or quoting). Finally, write focused sentences that state the facts, with appropriate references (''links'') to where these things occured; leave your emotional appeals out of it since they only distract from your point.

Disruptive edits. the characterization begins.
sorry if i am badly formatted, i loose some amount of my dyslexia compensation when i am po'ed.
Those VFDs were mockeries of consensus process. What good is WP:No attacks when the rule is only selectively applied to people rogue admins want to fast track or intimidate into silence?
I made cogent and rational additions to 3 vfds which were all of them started by an ad hominem.
And all of which were patently pov warrior gaming of the system.
In most cases, i just pointed out factual ad hominems. As votes. Maybe i should have invoked WP:
remove attacks, and deleted said votes. Hard to tell what the right move is in such a corrupted
double standard system. 

In any case, thats not why i am being blocked. I am being blocked for defending myself
against attacks, using cogent and factual logic.
The double standard here is apalling.
Nevermind in any case, apparently the only way to deal with the abusiveness of this system
is to go outside of the system and unleash the fury of a Sociologist with depth knowledge of
Logic.

obviously, if after a week and a half of abuse has gone unpunished, and nobody cares about it
on admin noticeboards, and theres no method to get abuse dealt with, esp by abusive admins,
this is a futile effort also. By all means, just ignore me and dismiss me, its all anybodies
done so far, i  have come to expect it.

There are a lot of policies that have not been resolved. How about focussing on [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] this month? Can we wrap-up the vote on this?

I've just read a bunch of the policy pages and I find myself agreeing with [[User:Jguk]] and [[User:Zephram Stark]] that we should be attempting to form policies that are in positive terms and not so legalistic and punitive in nature. Jguk proposed something along the lines of [[Wikibooks:Always act civilly]]. Zephram has also pointed to [http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-May/045082.html this posting by Jimbo] for some other context.

I support Jguk's intention but am doubtful about his means of achieving it. For instance, suppose a user reverted a policy page that had been moved, after a vote, from &quot;proposed&quot; to &quot;enforced&quot; back to &quot;proposed&quot; without any warning at the staff lounge or elsewhere. Suppose I reverted this reversion of the &quot;Enforced&quot; status to &quot;Proposed&quot;. Suppose the user reverted that reversion and I reverted that... How would &quot;be nice&quot; solve the resulting fracas? 

I support a minimum of rules, perhaps 3 major rules such as: 
# [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]]
# [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]
# [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]]
These would contain most problems that could arise here when &quot;being nice&quot; has broken down. For instance the reversion problem above would be forestalled by [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]] and would fall under [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]] if a vote had not been taken.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:43, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

: For your revert scenario, common sense prevails, an admin temporarily blocks the provoking user and instructs them to act civily or leave. The net effect is the same, I think.

::::Your point also places admins at the top of the control hierarchy, like tribal leaders.

:::::#You're misunderstanding what consensus means. Consensus decision making is predicated upon several things; that all users are working towards the same mission (to build textbook-ish instructional materials), that all users are acting in good faith, and that all users will work towards compromises when disputes arise. If a user is not working towards our goal, not acting in good faith, or not attempting to find compromises, the community can and should ignore or ban them depending upon the severity. Consensus is about evaluating the positions of users on issues, not counting their votes. If only 1 person in a straw poll is saying no, but they provide no acceptable reason, they get ignored. If they are disruptive, engage in revert wars, employ sockpuppets, etc they get banned. If after all of this, you still have reasonable people acting in good faith who can't agree, then either (a) the issue is dropped since it doesn't have sufficient support (b) (if one group is very large) the motion is passed despite the complaints. In the case of (b) the opposition can learn to live with the decision or decide that due to the decision, WB is not the place for them, or a particular book/article isn't worth the effort for them; that's their decision, and that's okay.

(Reset indent) Kellen, there are some good points here.

I couldn't keep away. Kellen, is your point 4b basically a statement that you agree with some kind of vote? In the example above, suppose a vote had demonstrated consensus according to 4b, would you ban the dissenting user if they reverted the change from &quot;enforced&quot; back to &quot;proposed&quot;? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:07, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

: Much of collaborative work is not so much about the changes as the context and social interactions. If the user appears to be acting in good faith in reverting the policy (say, maybe, if there is some serious harm that they claim will come from it) then no, it probably doesn't warrant a ban. If they are just being stubborn and refusing to accept the community's decision, and then they engage in a revert war, they are acting in bad faith and could be banned for being disruptive and not acting civily. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:27, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

: And no, 4b does not mean I agree with some kind of vote. Here is an flowchart I made for consensus decision making. The reality on WB is a bit different (and a bit muddled) due to asynchronous communication.
:[[Image:Consensus2.png]]
:People who vote no on something on wikibooks are of two types; stand-asides and blocks. Those who learn to live with the decision, despite the fact that they don't totally agree are implict 'stand asides' in the consensus process. The decision hasn't made them question their fundamental commitment to working on the goal of WB. (Other types of stand asides would be people who abstain or people who just leave a comment) The people who block are those for whom the decision on the proposal is make-or-break. If the community decides to pass the proposal over their objections, they leave. We see this in contributors who just disappear and in contributors who flame out.
:A block in a &quot;real life&quot; organization means you're much more serious about your objection to the point where you are willing to leave the organization if the proposal is passed. Since in these organizations you also have a much more highly developed social environment, this is quite extreme. It obviously doesn't work as well on WB/WP since we have a large and anonymous community with a very low barrier to entry.

For example, if a blocker fails to stand aside the decision &quot;shall we override the blocker?&quot; becomes a new proposal, then the decision &quot;shall we override the blocker of the decision to override the blocker&quot; becomes a new proposal. This continues until there are no blockers. However, if blockers at the top level block every other level of the iteration then the only solution is for a '''gang''' to form that secretly mounts an attack on the blocker.

::The iterative process is probably a natural way of handling events in an organisation that has no constitution. It is the method used in tribes and gangs.  The down-side is that each iteration takes months or years on Wikibooks and this places immense blocking power in the hands of individuals. This blocking may have nothing to do with the decision under consideration - for instance Zephram has voted &quot;no&quot; to several policy proposals in Wikibooks using the same text.  

::Organisations short circuit the iteration by simply using a majority vote according to some constitution. This allows them to respond to events in a timely fashion. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 11:07, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

:::It is a good flowchart. I disagree with what happens where a member still blocks after his concerns have all been addressed (albeit not to his satisfaction). At that time, we need to decide whether to override the blocker, and it is here that voting becomes useful. Informal voting can be useful to gauge feelings before this time, but the emphasis should be on looking to avoid a formal vote to override a blocker if at all possible, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:29, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

::: Uh, that's not what it implies at all. Yes, there is a feedback loop, but it's not mechanical. If the person blocks, and the community decides to override their block, the community tries to come to consensus then and there. The blocker isn't able to affect that decision making process by blocking again.
::: I agree with you that voting is easier in general and makes it easier to essentially shout down people who disagree with the majority, but I don't think it's the best way to come up with broadly accepted and useful policies. Keep in mind that wikibooks is not a business and time ''is not'' of the essence. We don't have to meet quarterly deadlines or make profit margins, and we can take the time to discuss issues rather than counting votes out of convenience.

== Academics, Wikibooks, and Authorship ==

I am new to Wikibooks but one thing I am curious about: is there a strong incentive besides altruism to submit material?  Since advanced textbooks are written almost exclusively by academics it seems like the open model for textbooks could be hampered by the incentive that drives academia: authorship.  Most professors write books based on classes that they teach but even if your book gets wide distribution the publisher takes basically all of the profit.  Academics are paid in recognition which does not seem to be exceptionally prevelant on wikibooks and probably limits the ultimate usefulness of the site.  What are the general thoughts that people have here on incentive for academic submissions?  It seems to me that altruism can only go so far but &quot;primary authorship&quot; or &quot;textbook coordinator&quot; status or something like it could significantly boost incentive to turn a lot of these stubs into high quality books.[[User:Mpickett|Mpickett]] 02:39, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

In fact I think it is quite the opposite, reputation counts here, I want to know who the principal authors and maintainers of a book are.  Does anyone have a friend or relative who has a real reputation in the real world who could be persuaded to donate some words?  Could someone persuade Richard Dawkins or Donald Knuth to contribute?

==Implementing consensus on [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]==

I have just re-read the Talk page on [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]. There really is a consensus on this policy. Those who have voted &quot;No&quot; (two qualifying users) have voted &quot;No&quot; because they disagree with the idea of a vote, or of policies in general, not because they oppose [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] so there is indeed consensus. I propose that [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] should be moved to enforced status. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:29, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

:I think we're still at the stage of &quot;synthesise concerns&quot; per the above flowchart (which looks good to me). The discussion on my concerns has not really moved forward since 27 April. If you'd like to respond to them, then I would be happy to re-engage in the debate. In this regard, I note that others have said that they would only like one behaviour policy, a sentiment that I would agree with. The question then comes down to whether this is it - whether this one needs to be amended before it becomes policy - or whether a different approach entirely is sensible. I have drafted my own discussion draft of what I believe a good approach for a single behaviour policy would look like on [[Wikibooks:Be nice]]. Hopefully that can help us (directly or indirectly) proceed towards getting us a single final behaviour policy that we are all happy with, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:08, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

::As I pointed out above, the flow chart above would lead to iterations and the possibility of endless blockings by one user. According to the flowchart and discussion, a user who was dedicated to the well-being of the project would stand aside. 

::The &quot;No personal attacks&quot; policy has only one real dissenter, yourself, and you are dissenting on grounds other than opposition to the specific policy. &quot;Be nice&quot; seems to be a carte-blanche for administrators to do as they wish. It does not define &quot;nice&quot;. For instance, would it be  &quot;nice&quot; for an administrator to archive a warning that a policy was about to be made enforced, then changing it unilaterally from enforced to proposed despite a large majority in favour of enforcement and then blocking it endlessly? Is that &quot;nice&quot;? [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 17:57, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

::I have no objection to your production of a meta-policy that includes the other policies but until then we should have something in place. You and Zephram are blocking specific policies on the basis of objections either to multiple policies or any policies. These issues should be discussed separately from whether a specific policy should be adopted. The problem with the model of primitive consensus building in the flow chart is that it does not allow timely decision making, one user can derail all decisions endlessly unless the others gang up on them and override them. I hate gangs. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 18:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

With respect, I disagree with you here. First, the flowchart suggests all concerns are discussed. It is only once all concerns have been discussed and there remains a blocking member that we need to decide whether to override that block or not. I note above that here, and only here, do I believe that a binding vote is necessary. At present, none of my concerns have been addressed at all. Maybe they can be, perhaps by improving the language of the proposed policy so that we are all happy with it. If that is not possible, then and only then do you need to decide to override me. Since none of us are arguing that personal attacks are acceptable, there is no reason to believe that it should come to this. This is not my view alone, another user has specifically requested that you address my concerns first before trying again to make this policy.

I would also note that other users have expressed support only on the grounds that they would like a behaviour policy set out, and that the wording can be improved later. In terms of whether this is the right behaviour policy for us to have, it is not too different from my view that the current proposal has some flaws, and these should be ironed out before the policy goes live.

Stepping back further, my [[Wikibooks:Be nice]] proposal is meant to be a principle-based policy. That is, it sets out the general principle to be applied. This may be where we differ as you seem to prefer a rules-based policy. That is, a policy that sets out precise rules that you either comply with or you don't. Full stop. Black and white. Personally I believe principle-based policies are more flexible and deal with controversial situations better. Plus they are less susceptible to wikilawyering (for instance, in a rules-based policy either you have followed the letter of the law or you haven't, and if you haven't the wikilawyer claims whatever you now do is unreasonable, even though you followed the spirit of the law). The rules-based policy allows for technical offences, and may create loopholes for the abusive editor to exploit. A principle-based policy is not so precise, but generally allows for greater flexibility and for shorter policy (you do not have to list everything that is to be banned). It also can be as strong as a rules-based policy. For example, would you not agree that swearing, excessive and persistent reverting and making legal threats would unambiguously be considered contrary to a general &quot;be nice&quot; principle-based policy, even when &quot;nice&quot; is not defined? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:18, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

:You say that &quot;all concerns&quot; should be discussed but the concern you are raising is the general issue of whether or not policies of the current type should be enforced. Your concern is not directed at the specific policy.

:Your &quot;be nice&quot; proposal needs renaming because it sounds sickly. Apart from that it is an approach that will need a lot of discussion and has little chance of being adopted for months or even years.

Kellen's right. We already have policies covering the areas you are interested in - they just aren't in a formal written form at present. It may well be desirable to formalise some of the unwritten parts of our constitution (particularly as it allows new contributors to quickly find out what behaviour is generally accepted and not accepted in this community), but there's no need to hurry - we can take time to get things right. For example, at present you are actively working towards writing a &quot;no personal attacks&quot; policy. Let me be clear on this - if someone makes persistent personal attacks on Wikibooks and refuses to desist I and/or other administrators will have no difficulty in chucking them off the site until and unless they agree to abide by the rules. This will happen whether there is a written policy on the point or not. Yes, it might be a good idea to spell this out somewhere, but even if it is not spelt out, if necessary (and I hope it never is), that course of action would be taken, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:17, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

== Gaming manual as a textbook ==

I'm throwing down the gauntlet here on this issue again.  I am sick an tired of a bunch of content being removed simply because it is of a particular theme.  In particular, the removal of the gaming guides was IMHO totally out of line, but in this case I would like to prove both Jimbo and the rest of the anti-gaming guide people that they are not only wrong, but flat out wrong about the removal of content simply because of the topic, not because of the content.

I'm willing to consider a number of options, but what I'd like to do is write a real honest-to-goodness textbook that would be of the quality that it could be used for a university class, but that the ''topic'' of the textbook is a video game.  Specifically I'd like to do [[Doom]] if for no reason other than Jimbo has specifically marked it for deletion and claimed that it could never be made into a textbook.  I'd love to prove him wrong on this point in particular.

::My former employer, Columbia College Chicago, has a new game design major. While no course on Doom per se is taught, part of the new curriculum is a course on game engines and writing and designing virtual gaming environments. It seems like it wouldn't be much of a stretch to use a textbook that is survey of say the original M&amp;M, Doom, and WoW to describe the art and design of these virtual environments. As long as the rigor exists in the treatise, it could very well be used at the course. Of course, one could include historicity and the nature of actually WRITING a game guide as a chapter.

This is not intended to be a video game walkthrough (which should have been the point of the debate well before the removal of the gaming guides), but rather an in depth scholarly review of this game, and to point out the historical significance that this game has within the computer gaming industry.  The historical roots of this game, including Castle Wolfenstein, Commander Keen, and other earlier ID software games, as well as other computer games would be included in this book as well.  How Doom has affected the development of other first-person shoot 'em up games would also be a significant point in this book as well.

All other Wikibooks and in general Wikimedia policies should be followed when developing this textbook, which the end goal is to reach a standard that if this is deleted, that wikibooks itself should be simply shut down as a failed project.

I don't know if there are any video game textbook supporters left on Wikibooks, but if there is anybody interested in taking on this project, please let me know.  I think a real textbook can be written on this topic.  Others may disagree, but this is also to see if there is any room left on Wikibooks to even permit the writing of such a real textbook.  My opinion is that just because of the subject matter that it shouldn't be deleted out of hand.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:19, 19 May 2006 (UTC)

:Video games are going to be an extremely disturbing phenomenon in the next decade or two as they become enmeshed with real life.

Wikibooks may well be the &quot;cutting edge&quot; publishing medium that gets out of video games just as they start to take over the world. 

:I do not play these games myself but it is obvious that they are the test bench for the future virtual reality working and trading worlds. There are currently 6 million on-line gamers involved in games that have real world cash interfaces and this type of cash represents over $800,000,000 dollars of real world money (See current edition of New Scientist).

My first question is what stance should we take on Doom? The real obvious one is to take the [http://www.doomworld.com/ports/linux_unix.shtml Doom Source code] and then do an analysis from there. The primary advantage is that yes, this fits the classical definition of textbook, but it probably wouldn't save the video game bookshelf.

:Another perspective I see we can do is to see Doom as an art of itself. Using Game Design textbooks like ''Chris Crawford on Game Design'', we could use his vocabulary of what a game is, and then analyse the game akin to a book or movie. Perhaps the level design and how mazes are as they are in Doom, the pros and the cons. Etc. Etc.

::Robert, as long as it's not just a walkthrough, I'd be fine with it.

Personally, I'd have no problem at all with a textbook on Doom along the lines that Robert suggests. Wikibooks is for textbooks. I believe we all agree that books similar to those used in existing classes in a number of learning institutions are within our scope. Additionally, I believe we all think that Wikibooks' scope is wider than that - although we do disagree on how much wider it is than that and how to define accurately what we mean by a textbook that can't be used for a current class in a learning instition.

To my mind a lot of what a textbook is is in the aim and style and the use to which a textbook can be put. It would be foolish to say that there can be a textbook on every conceivable topic, yet at the same time it is possible to write interesting and informative textbooks that do not correspond to classes in schools, universities or adult education centres. Robert's proposed book on Doom, for me, appears to meet the right criteria. I would stress though that our current book on Doom does not.

I would, however, ask Robert, for his own sake, to think whether he really wishes to pursue his idea - as I'm sure we are all aware, writing a book takes up a surprisingly large amount of time. However, if Robert will put in this effort in essence just to prove a point (and at the risk of Jimbo ordering the book off Wikibooks anyway) then I will not in any way seek to hinder him, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:29, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

I'm sorry, but I'm not following your logic, Robert. How is a &quot;scholarly review&quot; a game manual? The book [[Doom]] ''can't'' be turned into a textbook without rewriting all of the content, which is what you intend to do. Correct me if I'm wrong but Jimbo has never said that a textbook can't be written on this topic. In his [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=434945&amp;oldid=419429 WB:WIW revision], he said quite the opposite. I think what you have to ask yourself is whether a book would be usable in a classroom on any aspect of game design, like an annotated text would be in a literature classroom. I also don't know what to popularity of video games has to do with this. There are even [http://digipen.edu colleges devoted to video game design], but not one has a &quot;How to finish Doom&quot; or &quot;Doom Manual&quot; class. --[[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 16:59, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

:So make it a rewrite... even if it has to be from scratch.  [[Monopoly]] had this happen and has become a much better book as a result.  The opinion of Jimbo was that Doom could never be used as a textbook because of the subject matter.  Yes, he did say a textbook could never be written about this topic.  This was mentioned specifically as an example.  My proposal here is to rewrite, perhaps even from a clean sweep of the current [[Doom]] Wikibook being thrown out, to turn this into a textbook that could be usable in a classroom.  Major sections would include game play, economy (weapons and ammo), algorithms, and historical impact of the game both in terms of roots and what games have been developed from this one game.

:Based on what I am percieving from the people trying to remove video games, they are trying to delete content because of subject matter alone, and not content.  The discussion has become so heated that the issue of wheither any university-level courses were taught on the subject, with incredulity occuring when some actual courses were pointed out.

:In addition to all of this discussion, until Jimbo came in here and really pushed for textbooks, Wikibooks was about '''books''', not textbooks.  Essentially, this was for content that would normally be considered acceptable on Wikipedia, but for its length and the need to break it up into multiple sections.  Some additional flexability was granted for Wikibooks to do non-encyclopedia type works.  I will admit that the first Wikibook is the [[Organic Chemistry]], and that was a textbook.  Other content is on Wikibooks however, including content added by WMF board members that is clearly not a textbook in nature.

:I have been approached now by two different people who are openly trying to encourage me to fork Wikibooks with actual server space to do so.  I think this is an unfortunate situation, and I would rather that forking doesn't occur.  I still havn't decided if my effort is going to be used to work on those forks and abandoning this project altogether or if there is something worth saving here.  I do believe that far too much content has been removed from Wikibooks, especially when much of that content was added on good faith that it belonged here.... even surviving VfDs earlier.  While there was and is still cruft on Wikibooks, taking out two major bookshelves (Video Games and How-tos) is not a way to win friends and grow this project.  Especially when there is no place to move it within the context of Wikimedia projects.  Had this been done with Wikiversity (I guess they are next with the axe now) another fairly significant community would have been destroyed as well, with some potentially outstanding ideas lost permanently.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:30, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

::Wouldn't you agree that the content you will be using to create a Doom book would work better as part of larger textbooks, such as as examples? In my opinion, yes, it would be a textbook teaching concepts taught in classrooms, but just not a very good one. I don't think it occurred to Jimbo that someone would bother teaching game design using only Doom, as better examples exist.

::Has any attempt been made to ask the board or Jimbo himself whether he has the right to dicate policy? I would like to hear someone outside of Wikibooks say that this community has the right to decide upon Wikibooks' scope. If that happens, an active discussion should ensue and I'll give my opinion on the matter. --[[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 20:34, 20 May 2006 (UTC)

::: Well said Robert. As for critical study of Doom; I cannot think of a more revolutionary game than Doom. In fact, the word &quot;Doom Clone&quot; described First Person Shooter genre for *years* after Doom was released. It would be great as a case study. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:51, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

I cannot speak for the others, but my input in this matter has always been from the perspective of a gamer. I originally came to Wikibooks because of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' guide, where a large portion of my contributions were and likely still are. And once it was suggested that they be moved I was fine with that, as to me it makes sense to move to a more focussed, gamer-friendly wiki. Indeed I've talked to many outside of the wiki environment who were ''surprised'' that a site called &quot;Wikibooks&quot; had videogame strategy at all!

I bear gaming topics no ill will. If someone starts &quot;A Tempest in a Coffee Pot? Jack Thompson Vs. the Gaming World&quot; I'll be right in there expanding it and linking to interviews and the like. But if someone starts &quot;The Definitive ''Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories'' Solutions Manual&quot; I'll take it to Vfd soon after. Serious Wikibooks can and will one day be written regarding videogames, but the current game guides simply don't fit that category. And is moving them off Wikibooks all that dissimilar from your [[w:tabula rasa|tabula rasa]] propsal? [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:53, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

: Again and again, this argument comes up. And again and again, people fail to come up with a good reason for why Video Games should be removed. Unless I'm missing something here, but I don't see any good reason for video game guides to go away, aside from stir up trouble in the community.

: My strongest protest to this move is that it of all things, slaps long time editors in the face, and kicks them out of the wikibooks community. Whether or not this is for the &quot;better&quot; of wikibooks, we will have to live with the fact that we got a bunch of now former editors of wikibooks, who are very disgruntled.

: As Robert said, this move has made some people to go as far as make forks of Wikibooks. Isn't this a tiny little tipoff that just maybe something is off here? 2 people asking for forks means there are a *whole* lot more than just 2 people pissed. The only reason there is to this nonsense is that &quot;Jimbo Says&quot;. If it isn't obvious to anyone yet, Jimbo seems to be more busy at Wikipedia than [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Jimbo_Wales here], to put it mildly. As I've said before, there have been [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship/Archive#Artur_Nowak_.28_talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.29|admin requests]] that were denyed for having fewer than 270 edits, and having 6 month breaks. As much as I don't wanna downplay Jimbo here... I just wanna point out that &quot;Jimbo Says&quot; is not a good enough reason for all this. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 06:03, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

::I'm wasn't making any point, merely refreshing what I've said in previous debates before jumping into this one in an attempt to avoid any further confusion in an already complex debate. Bah.
::I'm not one to go too much against the flow of what the Foundation says, which is why I've largely accepted what Jimbo said. In the end the Foundation owns the servers, however we collectively have supplied both funding and content, thus making users by and large feel that we have some say in how we run things. Jimbo has always encouraged us to make our own policy decisions, however he has stepped in occasionally when those decisions didn't go the way he felt the Foundation stood (e.g. Getting a Girl and other such modules).
::But recently he's become more and more vocal, and less and less present to clarify his rationale. The videogame policy change is the climax; even to those supporting the move it's a stunning change of events. Is this the Foundation speaking, or is it only Jimbo?

: The only thing I see that is an issue, is why split a community already so small and fragmented? We aren't even at the &quot;critical point&quot;. So much work is needed to start up a new book; editors rarely search outside their pet projects. Newcommers are fustrated as they stumble upon stubs and stubs. The newbies who do find a project they are willing to work for quickly find their contents deleted, sometimes with no explanation, or any clue to where it has gone.

: Frankly speaking; I think a forking of wikibooks in any way would cause this project to crumble, unless it is a &quot;fresh start&quot; and everyone is actually willing to &quot;do it right&quot; this time (if you know what I mean).

: And after the fiasco with wikiversity, I'm not... encouraged... to take anything to meta anymore. Though if enough people join the cause, I may change my mind :-/. How many months have those wikiversity people been trying? 

: In closing, I'd like to ask; why not change the Wikibooks policy to include video games, howtos, guides, and other instructional resources? A new domain name would be a difficult goal to aim for, and it seems that changing policy to include what already is on Wikibooks is a *much* easier idea than:
:# Petitioning for a new Domain Name
:# Winning that petition
:# Writing a proposal to Wikimedia board
:# Correcting that proposal over a period of several months
:# Transwiki everything over
:# Restart policy from scratch

Hm. As interesting as the idea of a separate project is it would have some growing problems. Most importantly Wikibooks has been the videogaming recipient for several years now; no matter how loudly any policy changes are stated on Wikipedia there will still be content dumped here due to habit. And so a good portion of transwikiing work will be spent moving such stuff off Wikibooks and into &quot;Wikiguides&quot;, and then the userbase there will in turn have to move it around within their own system or else just plain delete it. If the Foundation ''are'' going to keep videogame guides in the family why not just leave them here? And as for the likelihood of the Foundation accepting the proposal, I really can't say how videogame content on its own, even if bolstered by non-gaming howtos, can fit the Foundation's &quot;educational mission&quot;.

===Page break for editing purposes===
:: So then we convince Jimbo/Wikimedia board to say it is better for guides to stay here. Lord Voldemort wants to create a new wiki for it. You want to create a new wiki for it. I want them to stay; or to move them to a new wiki for it. Renmiri thinks they deserve to stay. All in all; I see so much support for this stuff, not only from typical editors, but from at least 2 Wikibooks admins. If Jimbo really doesn't want them '''here''', well then, he'll have to live with his decision of (IMO) killing off the wikibooks project. Too many contributors are leaving because of this decision (video game contributors or not), and maybe we all can reverse this decision. And the advantage is now on our side to say why things belong. Damage is already being done to the Wikibooks reputation because of this decision, and instead of me hypothesising about it, I can actually point it out. Your fork is a near perfect example. The activity levels of admins is another one; it may be too soon for me to point this out, but coincidence or not; [[Special:Contributions/Robert_Horning]] and [[Special:Contributions/Kernigh]] activity level dropped a *lot* right after his little announcement (from 10+ contributions a day to 2+ days a contribution). I'm sure they're still here, reading, waiting to see what will happen soon on wikibooks before offering their time and energy on this project again. I know other people have gone &quot;missing&quot;, but I can't name them off the top of my head.

:: It is much easier to keep things here than to make a new wiki; on wikimedia or not. Though, if Jimbo says goodbye one more time, I guess we'll have no choice but to leave. But we aren't losing any &quot;time&quot; here on this issue, and I argue that there is no &quot;wasted effort&quot;. Making a wiki is too large an undertaking for me to just say &quot;Alright, I'm leaving&quot;. We got policy to make, and early policy to make as well. We'll have to come up and lay down the lines precisely, with no &quot;gray&quot; areas. The community will have to grow, we'll have to fight vandals, set up a hierarchy, etc. etc.

:: Thats all done here in Wikibooks now. The only thing to do is convince people (more or less, Jimbo) that we want this kind of content somewhere, and that Wikibooks is better off overall if we stay.

:: I suggest to Lord Voldemort: instead of that proposal for a new wiki; why not propose we change policy to stay here? I'm willing to support that 100%.

I simply see everything (Jimbo's statements, the bylaws, the educational goal, etc.) and think it's obvious that game-guides are not to be included. That's why I suggested an alternate domain. I just don't know anymore.

:::::Well, Renmiri - me - is just a n00b at Wikibooks and pretty new at Wikipedia too, so my lamenting that game guides are being evicted doesn't have the benefit of all the knowledge of WikiMedia history, bylaws, etc... But precisely because I am a newbie is that I wanted to give you my perspective: Game guides are, IMHO, where the Wikibook administrators of 2015 will cut their teeth in. From what I have seen in game sites and in Wikipedia / Wikibooks, this is where 13-16 year old - or even younger - will start thinking about cooperation and content management. I'm willing to bet that the first textbook a high school kid reads voluntarily will be a game walktrough. Even for the older newbies like me and others, the game guides provide a less stresful way to get into Wikimedia editing. A Wikipedia page about heart surgery, ancient history or all the others I have browsed those past few years looked pretty intimidating. Yet a page about a game made me confortable enough to click on that ''scary'' edit tab and I fixed a couple of things. Three months later me and other n00bs had injected so much life into that particular game series of pages that 10 pages were cited as Good Article and one got confirmed as Featured Article. And our newly found boldness for editing started spreading around to other topics and to Wikibooks. In my view, it may be necessary to evict game guides for the many reasons cited above, but Wikibooks is losing an excellent opportunty for training and nurturing new book editors and book readers. Get them while they are young, and on a hobby like games and those readers and editors might be yours forever ;-)  [[User:Renmiri|Renmiri]] 01:24, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::: My first wiki-edits were on the Chrono-Trigger artical at wikipedia. I strongly believe that there should be a place for game manuals for precisely the reasons that have been mentioned. I even voted back in the day to keep the game manuals here. However, it seems that the focus of wikibooks has changed (or at least re-focused on it's original goals), and I don't think that there is a big reason to fight that. Wikibooks will be hurt the most by a lack of focus. If we want to put everything and anything here, we should just rename it &quot;wikieverything&quot;. Unfortunately, the line has been drawn at game guides. But look at what we have now: dedicated editors who are going to take their game guides to a new, more appropriate venue, and a highly-focused instructional resource in wikibooks. Our situation is certainly bittersweet, but if it has to happen, we might as well see the silver lining. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:12, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

::::::: Wikibooks has always accepted manuals, howtos, gameguides, and so forth. We knew where the line was drawn, and we know exactly why Wikibooks isn't a &quot;Wikieverything&quot;. Even before the Jokebook incident, we were already pushing Wikiversity to leave, deleting other non&quot;wikibook&quot; material, and everyone knew exactly why it didn't fit policy. The line was '''already''' drawn, and now it is redrawn again. Now, even very instructional material like [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_undeletion#FAQ_for_alt.internet.wireless]] and arguably textbooks like that *very* informative MJ book are at risk.

::::::: And with a line drawn somewhere inbetween Chess and Video Games... I see nothing but confusion ahead for wikibooks if it continues down this path. No metric, aside from &quot;Jimbo Says&quot; decides the line between Chess and Video Games. And I doubt there would be any defined line between them.

::::::: And without defined lines; there will be no justification for really any action at wikibooks. Policy right now is shot; the &quot;Accredited institution&quot; metric is probably the only one that is being used at any rate, and even then, that metric is shot. The only thing left here is for us to argue opinion vs opinion; with no solid policy to say why something could survive a VfD now.

::::::: That is what is causing the fustration right now. And with the line now drawn at such a blurry place (Chess/Go vs other games), I dunno what to say. What about Omok/Gomoku? 6 in a row? Connect 4? There is no policy to say what lies exactly inbetween the lines here. 

::::::: The problem is far deeper than just Video Games on wikibooks. But I feel allowing Video Games on Wikibooks will cure nearly all of this policy debate up.

==Game guides on Wikibooks==

Given the harmless nature of such guides are you sure that they should be banned from Wikibooks? They are contained in their own section, the distinction between games such as Doom and Chess is debatable and, in the last couple of years it has become possible to actually trade inside games see Business week story. The users at Wikibooks are definitely uneasy about the ban. My userid is RobinH at Wikibooks.

:Drawing the line seems very easy to me. There is a simple question: can you point to a course at an accredited institution which uses this sort of thing as a textbook? I think there are college courses on chess. I think there are not college courses on Doom. Simple. Some people may not like that Wikibookians do not want Wikibooks to be a dumping ground for whatever doesn't fit in Wikipedia. But we have a charitable mission, and we need to respect that. --Jimbo Wales 21:46, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

== Idea for policy ==
Biographies have been a major isue over at Wikipedia, especially biographies of current people. The idea of a biography on a wiki is usually appauling to most people. And while wikitruth may not be true on this issue, it does list some pretty poor possibilities when it comes to biographies. Essentially; if someone disagree's with their biography, they simply can't just edit it; else the vandal patrol will catch the major revision they probably made and revert it. And then it becomes pretty difficult for someone to prove that they are that person, and etc. etc.

My idea for a solution is simple. No biographies on Wikibooks. To my knowledge, there are no biographies on wikibooks right now, so we aren't cutting anything, and more importantly, any'''one''' out. By initiating this policy now, we can catch the problem early, before it becomes a problem here on Wikibooks, as it is in Wikipedia. (indeed, all the major press problems on Wikipedia deals with Biographies). --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 06:30, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

:As we host textbooks, not biographical books, the issue is not a great one on Wikibooks. We do, though, have some (very brief) biographies of key figures that feature in the development of the science or humanity in question. For instance, [[General Biology]] has [[General Biology/Gallery of Biologists]], which mostly links to wikipedia, although [[General Biology/Gallery of Biologists/Charles Darwin]] is hosted on Wikibooks. I don't see any problem at all in this, as I expect the number of biographies we host to stay low. One thing we could do to head any potential problems off at the pass is to have a separate category into which to place the few biographies we have so that they can be closely monitored, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:24, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

:: Thats the issue. Closely monitored means that the person who the biography is about may have a very difficult time editing his own page, especially if he is a newbie to wikibooks (as is the issue in Wikipedia. How the heck is a newbie supposed to know any policy?). Loosely monitored == vandals on all biographies. It is a lose-lose situation I see here. Finally; a biography on a key figure in history would technically fall under textbook. Martin Luther King for example is a unit alone in some history books. I don't see how an indepth biography on say, Saddam wouldn't be a textbook at all. Useable in a (modern) history class so on, so forth. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 07:44, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

:::I don't agree with that. Wikibooks doesn't have the bloat and the red-tape that wikipedia has. We don't have many people here who are prepared to revert a gigantic revision like the kind that you are talking about. General policy here is an &quot;ask first shoot later&quot; kind of mentality. We are more likely to post a {{tl|cleanup}} notice or a {{tl|warning}} note on questionable content, and wait for a reply. I think that Biographies could be considerably useful, although we would probably do well to stay away from current-event people, and stick instead to historical figures who are already dead, and whose lives are set in stone. I would probably vote to allow biographies here, given the opportunity. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:32, 23 May 2006 (UTC)

hello, im from the hebrew wikibooks.

i would like to know if you know any way to show all pages under specific page.&lt;br /&gt;
for ex. if there are the pages:
*abc
*abc/1
*abc/2
is there a way to show on the page: &quot;abc&quot; list that will include: &quot;abc/1&quot; and &quot;abc/2&quot;?

thanks

== Creating Text book Modules for Wikibooks with Google Notebook ==

Creating Text book Modules for Wikibooks with Google Notebook
I've put together some short instructions for banging together module content with references on the web by using Google Noteboook... I think it could be leveraged into quite a publishing tool if used correctly.

* install notebook
* right click add note
* print document
* copy and paste into page
* text clean up (time consuming as Garrett Points out)

=== benefits ===

*easy to use
*includes URL for references
*wikipedia and Creative Commons materials available

Video of the process coming soon.

== Blocked User? ==

One of my contributors has told me that he can no longer edit pages on wikibooks.  He says none of the edit links show up.  He's on the opposite coast as I am, so I can't exactly go over and see what he's doing.  He had been making a lot of great contributions until this happened, and I'm trying to figure out what may have gone wrong.

Is this what it looks like when someone gets blocked?  I know that sometimes he logs in with his username, and other times he contributes from 71.103.178.xx.  Can anyone shed some light on this?

== Video game guides issue ==

Unfortunately, I think it's time that we put the issue of videogames to rest. [[Wikibooks:Game manual guidelines]] needs to be altered (removed or rejected), and [[WB:WIW]] needs to be altered to demonstrate that game manuals do not belong here. I would be highly in favor of writing an expiry time into this policy, so that we can review it at a later date, once we know what the long-term effect of losing these manuals actually costs us. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:35, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

:It's not looking good foe the people who want to keep the guides. The [[Wikibooks Pokédex|Pokédex]] was just deleted today. Even though some users want to keep the guides, actions show that they are leaving. [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 01:13, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

Inevitably those who were here just to write the guides will leave, and those here to write a mixture of textbooks and video game guides will reduce their time here. Hopefully they will go to the sites where the guides are being moved to and those books will continue to grow. Meanwhile, with a true focus on textbooks, Wikibooks should be in a fine position to expand and attract in those who wish to boost up our textbooks.

Ideally I'd like to be able to go to Wikipedia and invite in, say, those who would be willing to write a complete study guide for Maths GCSE - and then expand that for all GCSE syllabuses and then similar courses in other countries. Similarly for A-level maths - and for other subjects. The cost of published copyrighted texts is enormous - Wikibooks should set itself the aim of providing free texts, thereby benefiting the cause of education greatly, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:15, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

By removing books that are not textbooks from Wikibooks, Wikibooks will be in a position to become truly focused. Focus is important - it tells people clearly what we are about. It should enable us to attract more writers and readers in so that we can become a leading resource for free textbooks, which is, after all, Wikibooks' aim, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 07:26, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

:What we need is for the likes of you and I to get back to book writing - your [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikijunior_Kings_and_Queens_of_England Kings and Queens] book is great! That said, this is a &quot;Larry&quot; moment for Wikibooks, do we allow the future to evolve within us or do we regulate it? The risk taken by Jimmy Wales when he deregulated Wikipedia was enormous but our risk is tiny - we just partition the dubious books onto bookshelves at the back of the library. We can maintain the focus by presenting our high school books at the front. Which reminds me, I should really be lending a hand on these so we actually have some high school books.

== I love video game books ==

I am afraid that I have not been so clear in my past statements in this area and this is causing people consternation where I think there should be friendly dialogue.

I am an advocate of free culture.  I love video game books.  I think that people should be passionately writing books about video games in a collaborative manner.  These can be walkthroughs, these can be textbooks about the sociological phenomena of games, these can be textbooks for game programming, these can be user manuals, these can be joke books, these can be fan fiction, these can be all kinds of cool and interesting things that I have not imagined, and that none of us have yet imagined, because we are at the beginning of the grand experiment of internet collaboration using free licenses.

The issue here is not about me not liking them, the issue is that the Wikimedia Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non profit organization which was approved as such by application to the US Government based on a particular charter of operations, and we have NO CHOICE but to follow that charter.  If we expanded the mission of Wikibooks to include things which are outside the scope of our charter, we would lose our tax exempt status and place the entire project in peril, including Wikipedia, Wikibooks, and everything else.

There is a simple dividing line to use.  Is there a course taught at an accredited institution of learning, which requires as a textbook, the sort of book in question?  That's the rule.  It is easy to apply, it keeps us from having to fight about whether various things are 'important enough' or 'serious enough' for Wikibooks.  (A silly question, I think, because all kinds of things are important, and demeaning someones work as not being serious enough is not kind.)

I think of game walkthroughs and manuals in the same way that I think about Hamlet.  Hamlet is a great book, but it is not a textbook.  It belongs in Wikisource.  Game walkthroughs and manuals may be great books, but they are not textbooks either.  They belong at Wikia, or a generic wiki host.

We do not allow original fiction here.  We do not allow things that go in wikisource.  I have too much love and pride about the important mission of Wikibooks to let it become a dumping ground for things that the Wikipedians are kicking out.

The mission of Wikibooks is to provide a complete curriculum that will allow every single person on the planet, in their own language, to get the education that they need to survive and prosper in the world.  This is a noble mission, it is an important mission, but it is not a mission that can be achieved without serious focus on what we are doing here and why.  We are a charity.  We have a mission.  Let's stick to it.--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 22:06, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

:Another point that has been brought up concerns topics that are worthy topics of instruction, but that may not be taught in a standard classroom setting. For instance, [[Chess]] is certainly not taught in many schools, except there are chess clubs that teach it. And if we allow [[Chess]], then the slippery slope has us including all sorts of games. How do we answer this issue? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:14, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

:::But there are people who do seriously study chess, and there are chess schools where it is professionally taught to students.

Robin, the bylaws state (on page 1):

:&quot;The general purpose and objectives of the Foundation shall be the following: Wikimedia
Foundation is dedicated to the development and maintenance of online free, open content
encyclopedias, collections of quotations, textbooks and other collections of documents,
information, and other informational databases...&quot;

and they go on to describe Wikibooks as:

:&quot;a collection of e-book resources aimed specifically toward students (such as textbooks and annotated public domain books)&quot;

These seem quite clear, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:30, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

:They seem crystal clear but they do not exclude game manuals. In fact it would be appropriate for an on-line source such as Wikibooks to mount the first ever set of books that constitute a complete course in computer gaming. Computer game guides, if offered for free, do not violate either of the two documents mentioned, so the legal and constitutional arguments are red herrings.

:We are left with a debate about whether we want to have game guides and whether these are appropriate to Wikibooks. 

:My own view is that Doom is questionable but guides that cover &quot;Second Life&quot; and other online games that involve real financial transactions must be valid books. However, the whole debate is strange because these game books are harmless and can be partitioned onto the computer games bookshelf. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:18, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

::I'm afraid I do think you are somewhat misunderstanding Jimbo if you conclude that a game guide like Second Life may be permissible on Wikibooks because Second Life has some features that may make playing it valuable in real-life.

:::The problem is &quot;what is a textbook?&quot;. A textbook is a manual for a course of study but what is a course of study?

I think some aspects of video game play wll be economically viable in the near future - the fact that Wikibooks might already have a manual for the course will expedite course creation.

== consolidation of bookshelves ==

I've been looking at the following bookshelves in the [[Wikibooks:Social Science department]]: [[Wikibooks:Economics bookshelf]], [[Wikibooks:Business bookshelf]], and [[Wikibooks:Law bookshelf]]. I cannot speak for the business and law bookshelves as strongly as the economics bookshelf, but I don't believe there is enough material right now to constitute an entire bookshelf. I suggest that these be consolidated into one bookshelf for the time being, maybe the [[Wikibooks:Social science bookshelf]]. I'm sure eventually there will be enough content to constitute three seperate bookshelves, but I think that won't happen for some time. On my [[User_talk:Paul_Lynch|user talk page]] I have listed the inactive, low content books on the economics bookshelf that I believe should be deleted, or merged. I would appreciate it if an admin would take a look at this list, and either delete these books or let me know if they are subject to speedy delete or not. Also, just out of curiosity, if anyone is currently working on a book on any of these book shelves, could you leave me a message on my user talk page? Thanks, [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 23:10, 25 May 2006 (UTC)

:I will take a look at the books you mentioned, and do what I think is necessary to them. Also, the idea of bookshelf consolidation, considering the fact that we have so few books on those shelves is a good idea, I think. I am not to involved with the structure of bookshelves myself, other users and administrators are far more involved with that subject then I am, and I would hate to monkey around in a system that I know nothing about. However, if you feel that things would be better with a merged bookshelf, and if you have the time and energy to attempt the merger, by all means do what you think is best.

== &amp;amp; in links ==

hi, a technical question. I'm asking here because there seems
to be no consensus on what is or is not permitted/working/expteced/...

There were some links that have been removed from a number of
modules in the Ada Programming book, but not by the authors, as far as I can tell.
The change comments are consistently empty, so I don't know for sure
what the reason was, though I suspect the intent has been technical:
mostly &amp;amp;-links have been removed.

The help pages on links and URLs I could find were not exactly unambigous about
the issue: &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; ''is'' a valid plain URL character. You can
escape it.  &amp;amp; works just fine where we
need it, see below. &amp;amp; becomes %26 when the link is activated. 

The Ada programming book talks, naturally, about the &quot;&amp;amp;&quot;
delimiter. (Each delimiter has its own module.)
The &amp;amp; character works just fine in links, it is URL-escaped
(%26) and leads to the expected module:

I can use an internal link, [[Ada_Programming/Delimiters/&amp;amp;]], i.e.
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Ada_Programming/Delimiters/&amp;amp;amp;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
or an Ada/template, {{Ada/delimiter|&amp;amp;}}, i.e.
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|&amp;amp;amp;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

I can even omit writing a proper character entity reference and
still I get [[Ada_Programming/Delimiters/&amp;]] i.e.
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Ada_Programming/Delimiters/&amp;amp;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
and
{{Ada/delimiter|&amp;}}, i.e.
&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada/delimiter|&amp;amp;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

* Is this a technical issue?
* Is it a misunderstanding?
* Should the URL/link help pages be improved, or should I improve my understanding?

As I am maintaining two programs for turning Ada into wikibook markup,
I'd really like to know whether there is a precise specification of
what exactly composes an internal wikibook link. The editting help is
a bit vague and ambigous as regards the full character set, or am I
missing something?

The issue is of general interest, I think, as linguists, typographers,
prep school teachers, and authors of books on other programming languages
might run into the same issue. (If there is one.)

regards, [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 03:07, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

: If there's no problem with the links working, I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to use them in the Ada book. The person removing them probably didn't understand that they were valid. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:05, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

Will be usefull a new function like writing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:German&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''!'''&lt;nowiki&gt;zzz]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, will print zzz on the category page. If you agree with me I will post this purpose on bugzilla. bye [[User:The Doc|The Doc]] 12:10, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

Ok I've done it, [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6111 bug 6111]  [[User:The Doc|The Doc]] 20:36, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

== Policy on deleting inactive modules ==

Is there a policy on deleting inactive modules? I have a great example here, [[Supervisor_Nuts_and_Bolts]]: There is basically one real contributor, with no user page, who wrote all of the content in one day, 2 February, 2006. I think this should be deleted, but is 3 months a long enough time to wait? I think it is. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 02:26, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

:There isn't any content; it's just an outline, a stub.  Perhaps the stub macro should be added to it to alert people that there is work to do.  I'd like to know why there is so much interest in deletion these days, perhaps I'm just hypersensitive but it seems as if that's all people talk about here lately.  I think we should ask why anything should be deleted, is disk space that expensive?  It can't be bandwidth because pages that are not accessed don't cost any bandwidth so why the interest in deletion?  This particular module is an outline for a book on a very important subject so surely it should remain.  Anyway what does 'inactive module' mean?  I have written a number of modules (with content not just an outline) that have been inactive for longer than [[Supervisor_Nuts_and_Bolts]] if by inactive you mean that there have been no edits in that period.  I'm sure I'm not alone in that.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:19, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

:: The interest in deletion is for two reasons:
::# Jimbo has clarified some policies which mean that large chunks of content on wikibooks should not be here. Some of it is from transwikis, some of it home grown.
::# We have not (for the past 3 years) been very good about pruning inactive or abandoned books, so we have a build up of cruft, which certain users have taken the initiative in cleaning out.
::[[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:31, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

:::I think this is a mistaken notion.  Huge chunks of Wikibooks have been deleted or pruned recently, and the move to do so has been accelerating for some time.  Indeed, if you look at the total module count on Wikibooks you would have noticed that the total number of Wikibooks modules over the past several months has been going down, even with many new Wikibooks being started and significant expansions of several books occuring.  Debate over what should and should not be on Wikibooks has been ongoing, and quite a bit of progress was being made well before the fiat decisions by Jimbo as well.  Indeed, I believe that most of the results of Jimbo's pronouncements would likely have happened anyway, just on a slower timescale before it came to a head.  Indeed the problem I have come across is when I try to delete something like the Wikimania proceedings (clearly not a textbook or even a book) where after I deleted the content it was restored due to political pressures to keep the content.

:::This is an old debate, although due vigalance should happen to try and review content regularly on Wikibooks to make sure that the content that is here relates to the general guidelines of this website.  Far too often there have been people treating Wikibooks as a free public website where anything and everything can be published.

:::BTW, if you see a book like the one listed above, you can either add the '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' mark-up tag or add it to the [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] page for review by the community.  In some cases, simply by adding the book to the VfD page will get the attention of somebody and cause some meaningful content to be added that helps out all of Wikibooks as well.  If you want to really help out here, do your part and try to dig out these lost or forgotten modules.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:54, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

== Fictional Books ==

Can Wikibooks be used to make fictional books, imaginary ideas? And if yes, where, in the All Bookshelves shall I put it? — &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[User:Mastermind 007|'''''Master''''']]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Mastermind 007|'''''mind''''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Mastermind 007|'''''007''''']]&lt;/font&gt; '''09:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)'''

: No. Please see [[WB:WIW]], which explains this. You can put these on [http://www.wikia.com/ wikia], I believe. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:28, 28 May 2006 (UTC)
:Take a look at [[wikia:c:novelas|Novelas]] which is likely what you're wanting. There are also wikias for [[wikia:c:althistory|Alternative History]] and various other fiction idea-sharing environments.

== Redirects Having Semantic Significance ==

Noticing a major cleanup effort in the deletion logs, I can see a lot of
sense in most of these deletions, as many appear to have been technical (e.g., &quot;''':'''&quot; &amp;rarr; &quot;'''/'''&quot;).

Some redirects, however, can carry meaning and their deletion removes
more than a technical flaw (now). Consider ''Color/Orange'' versus ''Fruit/Orange'',
and the deletion of ''Fruit/Orange''.
If ''Orange'' deserves two separate modules because it is both a fruit
and in a different context, a color, then we might just have two modules.
A redirect from one to the other is unlikely, and it is unlikely deleted.
OTOH, what if subject ''X'' has aspects pertaining to both ''A/X'' and ''B/X''?
Chances are then that the ''X'' description includes all aspects of ''X'',
and that one of ''A/X'' or ''B/X'' is deliberately redirected to the other.

I see two solutions in the latter case: create a dummy module for all but the complete
''X'' module, and then either transclude or redirect. Right?

Follow this from the perspective of a textbook user skimming the index.
The index may offer a redirect, so that the reader is enabled to find
a reference to the (differently named) item.

What's the best way to deal with this situation such that

* Modules can refer to one aspect of ''X'' specifically using links
* The ''X'' module is comprehensive as regards ''X'' (all aspects)

Is redirecting a no-no in wikibooks?

[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 17:42, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

: Redirecting is fine. We do (or did), however, have ''lots''' of redirects left from book moves and removed books. Some useful redirects have likely been deleted in the process. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:23, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

== CC and GFDL compatibility ==

I was looking at this free microeconomics text http://www.introecon.com/ released under the Creative Commons license. I was wondering, is this license compatible with the license used here at wikibooks? Can I use any of the information? [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 21:05, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

:Unfortunately not. :( The licenses have some key differences that make them incompatible. And even if they were the author has chosen a nc (non-commercial) restriction which the GFDL doesn't have. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:05, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

== Could we have a Wikinovel on wikibooks? ==

You know the drill. Lots of people want to use wiki software to write collaborative works - and wikibooks is a great place to do it. Free, high quality novels? It's not &quot;free knowledge&quot; in the Wikimedia sense, but it's &quot;free books&quot; in the Wikibooks sense, and hell I think it would contribute to the world. Obviously there would be rubbish books and good ones, but like all of these wikiprojects, it's the good stuff that you work by.

So how about a bookshelf for '''Wikifiction'''? --[[w:User:Alfakim]]. --[[User:131.111.8.97|131.111.8.97]] 14:38, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

:No. Wikibooks is for textbooks. A novel does not fit that description. I do believe, however, that there are other wikis for the writing of novels, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:18, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

: See [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Fictional_Books]], where we gave fuller answers. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:30, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

:This is a very old argument that came up some time ago.  There was a very interesting Wikibook called Aarvard the Arrdvark that was very well written and intented to be a beginning reader for children.  After some considerable debate over the whole idea, and some serious discussion within the Wikibooks community, it was decided to remove this book and make a formal policy statement that Wikibooks is only for Non-fiction works.

:This has much more to do with something you need to know about the Wikibooks community.  Besides the whole textbook/non-textbook argument, you need to keep in mind the kind of people who are working here on Wikibooks.  This whole website is setup and organized to help you to write non-fiction books, with policies being set up to fact check the material and to do critical review of the content.  Writing fiction requires a very different environment, and it also opens up the potential to edit wars over content, where one person's opinion over what should be there is just as valid as anybody else's.

:The other problem is that allowing fiction, even in a limited form, opens up far too many other problems with content as administrators as well.  Just as you can't resolve fights over content, it can also be used as a loophole to add content that otherwise would be removed from even straight textbooks.

:I have worked on Wikis for collaborative fiction writing, and it is a really neat idea, both in theory and in practice.  Wikibooks is not the place for this sort of content, however.   For futher details, please see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]].  This is something that has been brought up many times in the past.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:17, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

== Research related to Wikibooks ==

Has anyone else got an email asking them to do a survey about Wikibooks? [[User:Gmcfoley|Gerard Foley]] 00:10, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
:Not I. Should we have? Is someone trying to gain information? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 04:02, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

Yes, we do. Actually, we are already done with the previous study. We would like to thank you all participants who participated in our previous Wikibook survey. In addition, I am happy to inform you that this research is being published by the Journal of Interactive Online Learning in March 2008 (http://www.ncolr.org/default.htm). Since the 2006 survey, we have been involved in creating three different wikibooks ourselves, including one on “The Web 2.0 and Emerging Learning Technologies” (i.e., The WELT) which has had contributions from graduate students and professors in China, Taiwan, Malaysia, and the United States (see: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Web_2.0_and_Emerging_Learning_Technologies.

Dr. Curt Bonk and I are in the midst of a follow-up study of Wikibookians—researching issues of Wikibookian identity, communities of practice, and overall apprenticeship and support (see http://www.surveyshare.com/survey/take/?sid=64648).   As the note below indicates, Erik Moller, the Deputy Director of Wikimedia Foundation, is aware of our research and has endorsed it. Here is his message to you.


&lt;div style=&quot;width:80%; margin:auto; background:#eeeeff;&quot;&gt;
Dear Wikibookian,

Dr. Curt Bonk and Suthiporn Sajjapanroj from Indiana University and their colleagues from the University of Houston are in the midst of an important study of Wikibookians.  They conducted a previous study of 80 Wikibookians in 2006 which will be published next month in the spring 2008 issue of the Journal of Interactive Online Learning (see http://www.ncolr.org/jiol/issues/).  In their follow-up study, they are researching issues of Wikibookian identity, communities of practice in Wikibooks, and the overall apprenticeship and support structures that exist in the Wikibooks Website.  Their current survey can be found at:

http://www.surveyshare.com/survey/take/?sid=64648

The Wikimedia Foundation supports efforts like this to understand and study our communities, and we invite you to participate in this survey.  We appreciate any help you can lend to Dr. Bonk and his research team.  Please note that this effort is separate from the Wikimedia Foundation cross-project survey that we will conduct in collaboration with UNU-Merit later this year.

Sincerely,
Erik Möller
Deputy Director, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt;

We hope that this research will help those developing wikibooks and related e-book communities around the world.  We promise to once again share the results.  Any questions or problems can be sent to me at ssajjapa@indiana.edu. [[User:Ssajjapa|Ssajjapa]] 15:26, 27 Feb 2008 (UTC)

== Real concerns about Wikibooks environment ==

I could go on endlessly debating if we should or should not have stars on our bellies.  That is not the point here, and if this was meaningless debate over nothing here on these pages, I would care less.

Here to try and sum up what my major gripes are right now over what is going on with Wikibooks can be expressed with just a few short statements:

#I have no idea any more what is or is not acceptable on Wikibooks.  So much is being deleted at the drop of a hat, and repeated deletions even if undeleted, that I am tired of trying to fight individual battles.
#If I or anybody else tries to write content here, I have no idea if it will be here in six months, much less for any other substantial length of time.  This is significant as content for Wikibooks sometimes takes six or more months to even put together.  Going back to point #1, the policy landscape is shifting so much right now that '''anything''' I write may be gone simply because one very active admin doesn't like it.  This even seems to include pages that are beneficial to the whole project, like [[WB:CCO]], that clearly don't violate any existing policy standard.
#Wheel warring is going on too much.  That is deletions and undeletions or sysops fighting each other with admin-only functions rather than trying to resolve things in a civil manner and trying to come to a concensus first.  This is something that really shouldn't be happening at all.

A very hostile environment has taken hold of Wikibooks recently.  I don't mind if I am overrulled or told I'm wrong occasionally, but some rather significant policy changes have happened where all I can do is complain well after the fact that the policy has become enforced and acted upon.  This is flat out wrong under any circumstance, especially when up until now there was a general community concensus procedure for trying to change policies on this large of a scale.  Such concensus was never achieved, particularly with the video game guides, even though the bookshelf is now gone for all practical purposes.  &quot;Jimbo says....&quot; is not enough to simply make a policy change, even if you want to give his words significant weight.  And Jimbo can be wrong on occasion.

Generally speaking, I have tried to work on educating new users to Wikibooks, operating on the philosophy that if they understand what this website is all about, that they will be making generally acceptable contributions.  I've also tried to step in before significant contributions have been made, so they aren't wasting their time here on projects that may be deleted in the future.  After huge efforts have been put into things like the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], only to be put up for a VfD for the second time, it seems like a total waste of effort.  And this isn't even the first book to have been put up for VfDs multiple times.

This is an awsome website and has the potential to do some incredible things that can be good to everybody.  I hope that inexpensive books can be produced from the effort here, including textbooks.  This is going to take time and effort to happen.  I just wish there were more patience with those of us who actually like to write books than those who want to get rid of them.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:17, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

:I know what you are talking about, but there are factors here that we need to consider. &quot;Jimbo Says...&quot; is good enough to make policy, so far as I am concerned. Wikibooks was set up with a specific charter in mind, and putting all manner of nonsense on here can invalidate the wikimedia charter. Last thing I want is to open my browser one day and see a message like &quot;The wikibooks project was abandoned, because the database was filled with all sorts of crap, there was no focus on education as was intended, and the admins weren't doint their jobs.&quot; I doubt that it will ever come to that, but we need to draw some lines in the sand to prevent things from ever getting that bad. Wikibooks needs to have a clear focus, or else it will never be able to acheive anything good. That focus is on textbooks. This is not to say that we can't take a liberal interpretation of the word &quot;textbook&quot;, but that does mean that things like the videogame guides don't belong here. And I wish they did belong. I wish that I could click a link, and edit a videogame guide without having to leave the project. However, it isn't to be. I wish that I could read news stories on [http://www.collegehumor.com on collegehumor], or download linux distros from [http://www.gamefaqs.com gamefaqs], or even browse pornography on [http://www.hotmail.com on hotmail], but these things won't happen because those websites have a focus and are sticking to them. Nobody wants all this chaos, but wikibooks is changing: We have been given a focus, and now we need to conform to it. I think we as a community want the Harry Potter book to stay, but maybe we need to test the boundaries of what does and does not belong here before we just keep or just delete anything. It has nothing to do with the fact that it survived a previous VfD or not, it has to do with determining what materials belong and what materials need to go, as per the new focus that we have as a community. If you want to give up on this place, and declare these changes to be too much, or too sweeping, then I understand. It would be a shame to see such a prolific contributor and administrator go, but I know what you are feeling. However, if you want to stay, and help lead us through this dark and uncertain time, then more power to you. I know that I choose to stay. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:42, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

I agree with Whiteknight that there has been a refocusing towards textbooks. When Wikibooks was set up, and throughout its life, it has always set itself up as a home for textbooks. It is true that for a prolonged period, it has also accepted books that are not textbooks, although these were never officially within its scope. It is only now, after Jimbo has given clear instructions, that we are now moving all books that are not textbooks off Wikibooks.

:'''&quot;we are now moving all books that are not textbooks off Wikibooks&quot;''' - books take a long time to write. You should only move substantially complete books off Wikibooks after a proper discussion in the staff lounge. Jimbo has not given clear instructions. Mr Wales is the head of this charitable trust and a reasonable man, if he were to look at the debate on this issue he would probably agree that it is not absolutely clear cut and needs debate, probably on each substantial book in turn.  [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:23, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

I believe this will have long term benefits - in particular it should help us attract more writers, and then more readers, in. In particular, one area where Wikibooks really could make a difference is by having complete textbooks for the most popular school syllabuses (which is easier for some countries and states of the US than for others). Costs in purchasing copyrighted textbooks are a large part of students/schools budgets. By reducing those to the cost of printing out a free book, or by having textbooks free for commercial exploitation without the costs of copyright, we can make a real difference. Of course, we have many great textbooks on Wikibooks that are not geared towards specific exams, but it is the ones that are so geared that can be the most valuable in financial savings.

I have been bold and started something which I suggested some time ago. [[Wikistudy]], for school textbooks geared to specific examinations, [[Wikiprofessional]] for textbooks geared towards professional and vocational examinations. It is only when doing this that I have appreciated what the FHSST and COTSP projects are about (search for them on google or wikipedia and you'll see what I mean). There is a lot of goodwill for these books - we need to make the most of it. I'd love to get things organised on here soon so that we can go to the WikiProjects on Wikipedia, or approach teachers in schools, and make this happen. I believe we'll soon be ready to do this, and this will help maximise the value of Wikibooks, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:28, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

: Useful, even only financially useful textbooks notwithstanding, wikibook is given the exceptional opportunity to do more than compete with dedicated and existing textbook publishers. We can add to the set of standard textbooks wikibooks on subjects that had spurred our particular interests, that would never make it into the plain old school curriculum, but that nevertheless keep learners in supense. A most desirable goal for a textbook. Those subjects for which no examination comes to mind immediately can nevertheless be most valuable. Learning is not by itself bounded by utility in examination, in school, or in the shop, and I '''strongly''' believe that '''this''' broadness and openness is what sets wikibooks apart.

: Please, keep an open mind about the possibilities of a world wide wikibook cooperation, one that may or may not go beyond the necessary viewpoints, ways, costs, regulations, topics, restrictions, etc. of a conventional perception of a high school textbook project. Kids, e.g. are not made just for those textbooks! Adding strict school rules is certainly limiting, and it does by definition exclude subjects and styles of presentation. Why should we want but this?

: In sum, please don't stifle the good work by getting mechanically formal, or by following someones personal views too closely. I for one wouldn't want my personal views be followed too closely. Could be dull! [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 20:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

Oh, by &quot;valuable&quot;, I really did mean in the financial sense, and nothing more. Of course we should encourage textbooks on all subjects in wikibooks (although we do have a problem that very few of our books get completed). We very much should be looking beyond the school curriculum. We should also make sure we do cover the core school curriculum well, though. This is important - it also provides good background knowledge for further learning in other areas. I certainly do not seek to inhibit the breadth of textbooks that wikibooks has - however, I also wish to see us excel in the core basic subjects that most schoolchildren learn, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

I cannot understand why people are getting so rule oriented on the subject of what should go in Wikibooks. This is a library of textbooks. Textbooks are manuals for courses of instruction. If we have textbooks that seem to have no courses then we should stick them at the back of the library. How much does disk space cost? Almost nothing. So why not just tuck away the books that have no courses in a separate bookshelf (&quot;Guides and manuals that have no current course of instruction&quot;) and forget this issue of &quot;What is a Wikibook?&quot;.

I would suggest the following compromise. If a book is a bona fide guide or manual of instruction then it belongs here (yes, even if it is a game guide). If there is no course anywhere in the world for the guide then it goes at the back of the library. If there is at least one course then it goes in the front along with everything else. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:16, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

I am old enough to remember when moves were made to ban Media Studies from academic institutions (in both the US and UK). Media is now a major part of both countries' economies. Please don't put Wikibooks in a straight-jacket, all that will happen is that we will become a backwater prowled by pedantic librarians. Please let us breathe. If you don't some other, more liberal site can just copy all the &quot;straight&quot; textbooks from here to complement its avant garde approach and kill us stone dead. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:42, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:Please don't get hung up on my semantics. I believe any textbook can have a place on Wikibooks - and I would use a wide definition of textbook (although I would not stretch it beyond its usual English meaning). I do agree that it is important we have textbooks that do not relate directly to any existing (or even putative) exam, and I haven't seen anyone dissent from that view. What I also believe, however, is that we should make sure that core school syllabuses are covered and covered well. However, I most certainly would not limit our content just to books addressing those syllabuses, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 10:04, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review: [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]]==

It is amazing that we have no policy for dealing with contentious decisions. The game guide issue could be decided by a vote if this policy were available as an enforced policy. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review: proposal to move [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]] to enforced status==

This policy proposal has, so far, met with unanimous support. It is innocuous, simply proposing that serious disputes are dealt with to one side of the book authoring process. It makes compromise the only worthwhile solution to a dispute. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 14:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:It is difficult to convey tone with text, so let me say this explicitly - I really do wish to be helpful here and operate in a collaborative manner to help resolve issues and to extend my good faith. I have an honest disagreement with you here and hopefully we can discuss this as friendly Wikibookians, who nevertheless do disagree on how to make Wikibooks better. 

:Robin, this proposal only has four people other than yourself commenting on it, and three people other than yourself voting on it. It really needs wider discussion and more support before we can think about making it a policy. I must say my first question was &quot;Why do we need this?&quot; It is also very prescriptive - it also has a horrible sting in the tail. We have previously discussed, and a number of others have commented, that we only really need one behaviour policy. This would make a second one. Why can't we move towards the goal of having such a single &quot;be nice&quot; policy (rename it by all means) and lose the prescription? I do find it ironic that you suggest I am being too rule oriented by saying &quot;Wikibooks is for textbooks&quot;, but you are the one coming up with lots of precise rules and methods. Take care, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 15:05, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

::This is why I have tried to publicise it here. It is prescriptive, saying that if there is a major dispute it should be taken to one side to make the disputants realise that the only way forward is compromise. No one gains from an edit war and this policy ensures that this is the case. 

::The &quot;precise&quot; rules are really about tidying up the policies at Wikibooks. It will make your job easier with your re-write, knowing which policies have strong support and which have none.  At the moment I do not feel that Wikibooks is a safe place for books. I could put a lot of effort into writing a section on evolution in a biology book and some people with strong opinions could simply wreck it forever. The Editing disputes and No personal attacks policies will provide some of the security that anyone who is prepared to spend hours writing a book requires.[[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:43, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

==Policy review: proposal to move [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] to enforced==

This policy has been around for a very long time and discussed at length on the policy's talk page. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] amended the text of the policy during the vote, all the voters were informed of this amendment and there now seems to be general agreement. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] has asked that notice of the move to enforced be posted here. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:43, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">OpenOffice.org is a free, open source alternative to the costly Microsoft Office. It possesses many of the same day-to-day capabilities as Microsoft Office, except that it is free to use and it is much more cross-platform than Microsoft Office. This makes it ideal for students or home users and people that have non-Windows Platform (Linux, MacOS, Unix, etc). 

==About OpenOffice.org==
OpenOffice.org is a free, full-fledged Office Suite based on Sun's StarOffice Suite. OpenOffice.org is composed of six tools: Writer, Calc, Impress, Draw, Math, and Base. Writer is a word-processor, it can be used to write text documents from a simple letter to novels. Calc is a spreadsheet program, it can be used to store, process, and present data and formats them in a table layout. Impress is a presentation software, it can be used to create various types of presentations with various animations (effects). Draw is a vector-based drawing program, the images are based on lines and shapes which creates an image with virtually unlimited resolution. Math is a formula editor, it can be used to write from your high-school algebra to a complex rocket science mathematical formulas. Base, the newest tool of the suite, is a database program, it can be used to design, create, and manipulate a database. OpenOffice also supports macro scripting through its OpenOffice Basic scripting language, which obviously is based on [[w:BASIC programming language | BASIC]] programming language. OpenOffice is also very extensible, OpenOffice has a plugin system which allows third-parties to add functionalities into the suite, available plugins include a somewhat tongue-in-the-cheek lorem ipsum generator to a professional database report generator to remote control add-on for Impress.

OpenOffice.org's project started on 13 October 2000, with Sun's announcement of the project. Today, OpenOffice is available on all major platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, UNIX, and of course Sun's Solaris, and it is available in [http://l10n.openoffice.org/languages.html over 80 languages and localizations]. OpenOffice also pioneered the [http://www.oasis-open.org OASIS] OpenDocument Standard and it has been its native format since OpenOffice 2.0. A number of other Office Suites has also adopted OpenDocument Standard to some degree, but unfortunately [[w:Microsoft Office | Microsoft Office]], another Office Suite which has the de facto largest user base, declined to follow the standard and developed their [[w:Office Open XML | own XML standard]] instead.

Due to its open source nature, there are many [http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/DerivedWorks other office suites] that has their codes in partial or in whole derived from OpenOffice.org. Sun's StarOffice, in particular, bases most of its code on OpenOffice's codes, but added some additional proprietary components. The free and open source nature (and its quality) also makes OpenOffice.org a favorite choice among Linux distros makers to include OpenOffice.org in their distros as the default Office software. OpenOffice.org is also favored among some governments due to its open nature, they claim that a closed, proprietary document format like Microsoft's binary .doc format is detrimental in the long-term, when the company owning the format it have gone out-of-business, the cost of conversion in the future would be much higher with a closed, proprietary format. In the short term, the cost deploying thousands of computers with an expensive, proprietary suite may also be higher than deploying free, open suite.

== How to Get It?==
OK, now I know what OpenOffice is, so how do I get it?

There are three official ways of distribution of OpenOffice, all of which are free:
* Direct Download from [http://download.openoffice.org/index.html OpenOffice's download page].
* [[Bittorrent]] download ([http://distribution.openoffice.org/p2p/ Tracker files])
* CD-ROM distribution, [http://distribution.openoffice.org/cdrom/ List of OpenOffice's CD distributor]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Geiger_counter.jpg|right|thumb]]

We have learned in the last two chapters about how radiation interacts with matter and we are now in a position to apply our understanding to the detection of radiation.

One of the major outcomes of the interaction of radiation with matter is the creation of ions as we saw in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter|Chapter 5]].  This outcome is exploited in gas-filled detectors as you will see in this chapter.  The detector in this case is essentially a gas, in that it is the atoms of a gas which are ionised by the radiation.  We will see in the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Scintillation_Detectors|next chapter]] that solids can also be used as radiation detectors but for now we will deal with gases and be introduced to detectors such as the [[W:Ionization_chamber|Ionization Chamber]] and the [[W:Geiger_counter|Geiger Counter]].

Before considering these specific types of gas-filled detectors we will first of all consider the situation from a very general perspective.

== Gas-Filled Detectors ==

As we noted above the radiation interacts with gas atoms in this form of detector and causes ions to be produced.  On the basis of what we covered in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter|Chapter 5]] it is easy to appreciate that it is the Photoelectric and Compton Effects that cause the ionisations when the radiation consists of gamma-rays with energies useful for diagnostic purposes.

There are actually two particles generated when an ion is produced - the positive ion itself and an electron.  These two particles are collectively called an '''ion pair'''.  The detection of the production of ion pairs in the gas is the basis upon which gas detectors operate.  The manner in which this is done is by using an electric field to sweep the electrons away to a positively charged electrode and the ions to a negatively charged electrode.  

Let us consider a very simple arrangement as shown in the following figure:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM8_1.gif|320px]]&lt;/center&gt;

Here we have two electrodes with the gas between them.  Something like a capacitor with a gas dielectric.

The gas which is used is typically an inert gas, for example [[W:Argon|argon]] or [[W:Xenon|xenon]].  The reason for using an inert gas is so that chemical reactions will not occur within the gas following the ionisations which could change the characteristics of our detector.

A dc voltage is placed between the two electrodes.  As a result when the radiation interacts with a gas atom the electron will move towards the positive electrode and the ion will move towards the negative electrode.  But will these charges reach their respective electrodes?  The answer is obviously dependent on the magnitude of the dc voltage.  For example if at one extreme we had a dc voltage of a microvolt (that is, one millionth of a volt) the resultant electric field may be insufficient to move the ion pair very far and the two particles may recombine to reform the gas atom.  At the other extreme suppose we applied a million volts between the two electrodes.  In this case we are likely to get sparks flying between the two electrodes - a lightning bolt if you like - and our detector might act something like a [[W:Neon_sign|neon sign]].  Somewhere in between these two extremes though we should be able to provide a sufficient attractive force for the ion and electron to move to their respective electrodes without recombination or sparking occurring.

We will look at this subject in more detail below.  Before we do let us see how the concept of the simple detector illustrated above is applied in practice.  The gas-filled chamber is generally cylindrical in shape in real detectors.  This shape has been found to be more efficient than the parallel electrode arrangement shown above.

A cross-sectional view through this cylinder is shown in the following figure:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM8_2.gif|320px]]&lt;/center&gt;

The positive electrode consists of a thin wire running through the centre of the cylinder and the negative electrode consists of the wall of the cylinder.  In principle we could make such a detector by getting a section of a metal pipe, mounting a wire through its centre, filling it with an inert gas and sealing the ends of the pipe.  Actual detectors are a little bit more complex however but let us not get side-tracked at this stage.

We apply a dc voltage via a battery or via a dc voltage supply and connect it as shown in the figure using a resistor, R.  Now, assume that a gamma-ray enters the detector.  Ion pairs will be produced in the gas - the ions heading towards the outer wall and the electrons heading towards the centre wire.  Let us think about the electrons for a moment.  When they hit the centre wire we can simply think of them as entering the wire and flowing through the resistor to get to the positive terminal of the dc voltage supply.  These electrons flowing through the resistor constitute an electric current and as a result of [[W:Ohm%27s_law|Ohm's Law]] a voltage is generated across the resistor.  This voltage is amplified by an amplifier and some type of device is used to register the amplified voltage.  A loud-speaker is a fairly simple device to use for this purpose and the generation of a voltage pulse is manifest by a click from the loud-speaker.  Other display devices include a '''ratemeter''' which displays the number of voltage pulses generated per unit time - something like a speedometer in a car - and a pulse counter (or '''scaler''') which counts the number of voltage pulses generated in a set period of time.  A voltage pulse is frequently referred to in practice as a '''count''' and the number of voltage pulses generated per unit time is frequently called the '''count rate'''.

== DC Voltage Dependence ==

If we were to build a detector and electronic circuit as shown in the figure above we could conduct an experiment that would allow us to explore the effect of the dc voltage on the magnitude of the voltage pulses produced across the resistor, R.  Note that the term '''pulse height''' is frequently used in this field to refer to the magnitude of voltage pulses.

Ideally, we could generate a result similar to that illustrated in the following figure:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM8_3.gif|320px]]&lt;/center&gt;

The graph illustrates the dependence of the pulse height on the dc voltage.  Note that the vertical axis representing the pulse height is on a logarithmic scale for the sake of compressing a large linear scale onto a reasonably-sized graph.  

The experimental results can be divided into five regions as shown.  We will now consider each region in turn.

* '''Region A''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here V&lt;sub&gt;dc&lt;/sub&gt; is relatively low so that recombination of positive ions and electrons occurs.  As a result not all ion pairs are collected and the voltage pulse height is relatively low. It does increase as the dc voltage increases however as the amount of recombination reduces.

* '''Region B''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;dc&lt;/sub&gt; is sufficiently high in this region so that only a negligible amount of recombination occurs.  This is the region where a type of detector called the '''Ionization Chamber''' operates.

* '''Region C''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;dc&lt;/sub&gt; is sufficiently high in this region so that electrons approaching the centre wire attain sufficient energy between collisions with the electrons of gas atoms to produce new ion pairs.  Thus the number of electrons is increased so that the electric charge passing through the resistor, R, may be up to a thousand times greater than the charge produced initially by the radiation interaction.  This is the region where a type of detector called the [[W:Proportional_counter|Proportional Counter]] operates.

* '''Region D''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;dc&lt;/sub&gt; is so high that even a minimally-ionizing particle will produce a very large voltage pulse.  The initial ionization produced by the radiation triggers a complete gas breakdown as an avalanche of electrons heads towards and spreads along the centre wire.  This region is called the '''Geiger-Müller Region''', and is exploited in the Geiger Counter.

* '''Region E''' &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here V&lt;sub&gt;dc&lt;/sub&gt;  is high enough for the gas to completely breakdown and it cannot be used to detect radiation.

We will now consider features of the Ionisation Chamber and the Geiger Counter in more detail.

== Ionisation Chamber ==

The ionisation chamber consists of a gas-filled detector energised by a relatively low dc voltage.  We will first of all make an estimate of the voltage pulse height generated by this type of detector.  We will then consider some applications of ionisation chambers.

When a beta-particle interacts with the gas the energy required to produce one ion pair is about 30 eV.  Therefore when a beta-particle of energy 1 MeV is completely absorbed in the gas the number of ion pairs produced is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{1\ \text{MeV}}{30\ \text{eV}} = \frac{1 \cdot 10^6}{30} \approx 3 \cdot 10^4\ \text{ion pairs}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The electric charge produced in the gas is therefore

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q = n \cdot e&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore (3 \cdot 10^4\ \text{ion pairs}) \cdot (1.6 \cdot 10^{-19}\ \text{C})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore Q = 5 \cdot 10^{-15}\ \text{C}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If the capacitance of the ionisation chamber (remember that we compared a gas-filled detector to a capacitor above) is 100 pF then the amplitude of the voltage pulse generated is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{Q}{C} = \frac{5 \cdot 10^{-15}\ \text{C}}{100 \cdot 10^{-12}\ \text{F}} = 5 \cdot 10^{-5}\ \text{V}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore V = 50\ \mu\text{V}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Because such a small voltage is generated it is necessary to use a very sensitive amplifier in the electronic circuitry connected to the chamber.

We will now learn about two applications of ionisation chambers.  The first one is for the measurement of radiation exposures.  You will remember from [[../Units_of_Radiation_Measurement|Chapter 4]] that the unit of radiation exposure (be it the SI or the traditional unit) is defined in terms of the amount of electric charge produced in a unit mass of a air.  An ionization chamber filled with air is the natural instrument to use for such measurements.

The second application is the measurement of radioactivity.  The ionisation chamber used here is configured in what is called a '''re-entrant''' arrangement (see figure below) so that the sample of radioactive material can be placed within the detector using a holder and hence most of the emitted radiation can be detected.  The instrument is widely referred to as an '''Isotope Calibrator''' and the trickle of electric current generated by such a detector is calibrated so that a reading in units of radioactivity (for example MBq or mCi) can be obtained.  Most well-run Nuclear Medicine Departments will have at least one of these devices so that doses of radioactivity can be checked prior to administration to patients.

Here are some photographs of ionisation chambers designed for various applications:

== Geiger Counter ==

We saw earlier that the Geiger Counter operates at relatively high dc voltages (for example 400-900 volts) and that an avalanche of electrons is generated following the absorption of radiation in the gas.  The voltage pulses produced by this detector are relatively large since the gas effectively acts as an amplifier of the electric charge produced.

There are four features of this detector which we will discuss.  The first is that a sensitive amplifier (as was the case with the Ionization Chamber) is not required for this detector because of the gas amplification noted above.

The second feature results from the fact that the generation of the electron avalanche must be stopped in order to reform the detector.  In other words when a radiation particle/photon is absorbed by the gas a complete gas breakdown occurs which implies that the gas is incapable of detecting the next particle/photon which enters the detector.  So in the extreme case one minute we have a radiation detector and the following moment we do not.

A means of stopping the electron avalanche is therefore required - a process called '''Quenching'''.  One means of doing this is by electronically lowering the dc voltage following an avalanche.  A more widely used method of quenching is to add a small amount of a '''quenching gas''' to the inert gas.  For example the gas could be argon with [[W:Ethyl_alcohol|ethyl alcohol]] added.  The ethyl alcohol is in vapour form and since it consists of relatively large molecules energy which would in their absence give rise to sustaining the electron avalanche is absorbed by these molecules.  The large molecules act like a brake in effect.

Irrespective of the type of quenching used the detector is insensitive for a small period of time following absorption of a radiation particle/photon.  This period of time is called the [[W:Dead_time|Dead Time]] and this is the third feature of this detector which we will consider.  Dead times are relatively short but nevertheless significant - being typically of the order of 200-400 µs.  As a result the reading obtained with this detector is less than it should be.  The true reading without going into detail can be obtained using the following equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{A}{1 - \tau A}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where T is the true reading, A is the actual reading and &amp;tau; is the dead time.  Some instruments perform this calculation automatically.

The fourth feature to note about this detector is the dependence of its performance on the dc voltage.  The Geiger-Müller Region of our figure above is shown in more detail below:

[[Image:NM8_12.gif|320px|center]]

Notice that it contains a plateau where the count rate obtained is independent of the dc voltage.  The centre of this plateau is where most detectors are operated.  It is clear that the count rate from the detector is not affected if the dc voltage fluctuates about the operating voltage.  This implies that a relatively straight-forward dc voltage supply can be used.  This feature coupled with the fact that a sensitive amplifier is not needed translates in practice to a relatively inexpensive radiation detector.

'''Please post at the bottom of the page'''

== [[Ancient History]] ==

I'd be delighted if you would contribute to this project.  I think I got to be editor by being the only active contributor for the few days while they were setting up the infoboxes.  

I think it would be best if this book was an [[Ancient History]] textbook and not an Ancient Egypt or Ancient Greece textbook.  By this, I mean that your favorite dynasties and my favorite classical events rate a paragraph or so, and not several pages. We should stick to broad themes and overall forces, rather than nitty-gritty details.  However, because this is an open-source project, I'm trying to keep an open mind about it. 

I also think that we should have a discussion going on the main page about this, so that future contributors can have a sense of the overall intent of the book and its driving philosophies.  Does this make sense to you? -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 14:23, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

P.S., would you please read and edit the [[Ancient History/Egypt|Egypt]] page which gives the overview paragraphs, and add whatever you think appropriate, and then do the same at [[Ancient History/Egypt/Geography|Egyptian Geography]]?  I'd be tremendously grateful. [[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 19:52, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

The additions to [[Ancient History/Egypt|Egypt]], including Predynastic Egypt, look good.  I made a few editorial changes, including spelling and a few comma movements; I also shifted the voice of some sentences to active, because the passive voice in history textbooks drives me up the wall.  I hope you approve of my changes. Glad to work with you! -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 19:50, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

== Paleolith &amp; Neolith ==

J -- I've got substantial sections of the Paleolithic and Neolithic pages filled out.  I'm not really clear on my hominids so I want to go back in and research some of that before I try writing those sections.  Secretly I'm hoping that someone who knows more than I do will come along and volunteer to do those.  I'm planning to leave Egypt to you for the moment, and get to work on Mesopotamia next, so that each section has at least some text that can be filled in around and/or edited as other people join the project.  Any thoughts on this? -[[User:Andrew Watt|Andrew Watt]] 15:15, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Talk:Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations]] ==

I'd like to point you in the direction of the discussion on date notation on this page. Since you are a regular contributor to our history textbooks, your input would be particularly valuable.

First, however, I'd like to note how we go about deciding things on Wikibooks, in case you are unfamiliar with this. Essentially we discuss them together, taking account of all concerns raised, and find a way of resolving the issue that everyone is happy to go along with. Very rarely, once all issues raised have been discussed, we may go to a confirmatory vote, or request a dissenting editor to step aside from his argument - but on the whole it does not come to that. So if there are things you are concerned about, please feel free to raise them.

Turning to [[Talk:Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations]] itself, you will note that in the discussion there, whilst some users have stated their own personal preference in date style notation, those who have been arguing that the text should use one notation over another have been considering what is most appropriate for the book's target audience. Personally, I very much think that this should be the determining factor, and that it is therefore right that this is where the discussion has been heading. You will note that, for this particular book, which has as its audience children aged 8 to 12 living anywhere in the English-speaking world, most contributors are supportive of using the BC/AD notation rather than the BCE/CE notation. As you are a contributor to our history books (and I very much hope remain a contributor) to that book, it would be useful if you could visit the discussion and either raise further points that you believe should be considered, or alternatively indicate whether you personally would foresee any difficulties in using BC/AD notation for that book.

I also believe that the arguments in that history book readily transfer for any other history book with a general audience, which includes some of the history books that you have been contributing too on Wikibooks. If you have comments regarding that, again, I should be grateful if you would note them on [[Talk:Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations]]. If you believe there is anyone else who, in particular, ought to be invited to comment, please let them know about the discussion, so that any decision we come to is one that everyone can accept. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:53, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

==[[Saylor.org's Ancient Civilizations of the World]]==
Hey there, I noticed that you have been a sginificant contributor to the textbook on ancient civilizations. I am currently working with the [http://www.saylor.org/about/ Saylor Foundation] to create a similar textbook that we can host and use on our website for our history course on ancient civilizations (which we offer for free to anybody on the internet). We would love for you to check out [[Saylor.org's Ancient Civilizations of the World]] and give us some feedback or make some contributions! --[[User:Azin|Azin]] ([[User talk:Azin|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Azin|contribs]]) 21:17, 6 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating umbraco pages programmatically ==

This is based on an original article at 
http://www.umbraco.org/frontpage/documentation/implementingnetcontrols/creatingumbracopagesprogrammatically.aspx

=== Getting Started ===

It's easy to create new pages programmatically using the umbraco api (businesslogic). Just make sure you reference the umbraco.dll (or if running 2.1: cms.dll and businesslogic.dll).

Here's a few lines of sample code that shows how to do it.

&lt;pre&gt;
using umbraco.cms.businesslogic.web;
 
// The documenttype that should be used, replace 10 with the id of your documenttype

DocumentType dt = new DocumentType(10);
 
// The umbraco user that should create the document, 
// 0 is the umbraco system user, and always exists

umbraco.BusinessLogic.User u = new umbraco.BusinessLogic.User(0);
 
// The id of the parent document
 
int parent = 100;
 
// Create the document
 
Document d = Document.MakeNew(&quot;My weblog post&quot;, dt, u, parent);
 
// Add values to the generic properties of the document 
// (where bodyText is the alias of your property)

d.getProperty(&quot;bodyText&quot;).Value = &quot;Lorem Ipsum&quot;;
 
// Set the publish status of the document and there by create a new version 

d.Publish(u); 

// Tell the runtime environment to publish this document 

umbraco.library.PublishSingleNode(d.Id);
&lt;/pre&gt;

In umbraco version 2.1, you can use the DocumentType.GetByAlias(string Alias), so you're not dependent on identifiers. This is best practice and very important in order to make your code re-usable. If you're running 2.0, make sure that the id of the documenttype can be changed from umbraco by making a public property.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:PET-detectorsystem.png|thumb|right|&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;]]

The second type of radiation detector we will discuss is called the scintillation detector.  [[W:Scintillation_%28physics%29|Scintillations]] are minute flashes of light which are produced by certain materials when they absorb radiation.  These materials are variously called fluorescent materials, fluors, [[W:Scintillator|scintillators]] or phosphors.  

If we had a radioactive source and a scintillator in the lab we could darken the room, move the scintillator close to the source and see the scintillations.  These small flashes of light might be green or blue or some other colour depending on the scintillator.  We could also count the number of flashes produced to gain an estimate of the radioactivity of the source, that is the more flashes of light seen the more radiation present.  

The scintillation detector was possibly the first radiation detector discovered.  You might have heard the story of the discovery of X-rays by [[W:Wilhelm_R%C3%B6ntgen|Wilhelm Roentgen]] in 1895.  He was working one evening in his laboratory in Wurzburg, Germany with a device which fired a beam of electrons at a target inside an evacuated glass tube.  While working with this device he noticed that some platino-barium cyanide crystals, which he just happened to have close by, began to glow -  and that they stopped glowing when he switched the device off.  Roentgen had accidentally discovered a new form of radiation.  He had also accidentally discovered a scintillator detector.

Although scintillations can be seen we have a more sophisticated way of counting and measuring them today by using some form of [[W:Photodetector|photodetector]].

We will learn about the construction and mode of operation of this type of detector in this chapter.  In addition, we will see how it can be used not just for detecting the presence of ionizing radiation but also for measuring the '''energy''' of that radiation.

Before we do however it is useful to note that scintillators are very widely used in the medical radiations field.  For example the [[W:X-ray_machine|X-ray cassette]] used in radiography contains a scintillator (called an '''intensifying screen''') in close contact with a photographic film.  A second example is the '''X-ray Image Intensifier''' used in [[W:Fluoroscopy|fluoroscopy]] which contains scintillators called phosphors.  Scintillators are also used in some [[W:Computed_tomography|CT Scanners]] and as we will see in the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Nuclear_Medicine_Imaging_Systems|next chapter]], in the [[W:Gamma_camera|Gamma Camera]] and [[W:Positron_emission_tomography|PET Scanner]].  Their application is not limited to the medical radiations field in that scintillators are also used as screens in [[W:Television|television sets]] and [[W:Computer_display|computer monitors]] and for generating light in [[W:Fluorescent_lamp|fluorescent tubes]] - to mention just two common applications.  What other applications can you think of?

So scintillators are a lot more common than you might initially think and you will therefore find the information presented here useful to you not just for your studies of nuclear medicine.

== Fluorescent Materials ==

Some fluorescent materials are listed in the following table.  Thallium-activated [[W:Sodium_iodide|sodium iodide]], NaI(Tl) is a crystalline material which is widely used for the detection of gamma-rays in scintillation detectors.  We will be looking at this in more detail below.

Another crystalline material sodium-activated [[W:Caesium_iodide|caesium iodide]], CsI(Na) is widely used for X-ray detection in devices such as the [[W:X-ray_image_intensifier|X-ray image intensifier]].  Another one called calcium tungstate, CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has been widely used in X-ray cassettes although this substance has been replaced by other scintillators such as lanthanum oxybromide in many modern cassettes.

Notice that some scintillation materials are activated with certain elements.  What this means is that the base material has a small amount of the activation element present.  The term [[W:Doping_%28semiconductor%29|doped]] is sometimes used instead of '''activated'''.  This activating element is used to influence the wavelength (colour) of the light produced by the scintillator. 

Silver-activated [[W:Zinc_sulfide|zinc sulphide]] is a scintillator in powder form and p-terphenyl in toluene is a [[W:Liquid_scintillation_counting|liquid scintillator]].  The advantage of such forms of scintillators is that the radioactive material can be placed in close contact with the scintillating material.  For example if a radioactive sample happened to be in liquid form we could mix it with a liquid scintillator so as to optimise the chances of detection of the emitted radiation and hence have a very sensitive detector.

A final example is p-terphenyl in polystyrene which is a scintillator in the form of a plastic.  This form can be easily made into different shapes like most plastics and is therefore useful when detectors of particular shapes are required.

== Photomultiplier Tube ==
A scintillation crystal coupled to a [[W:Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tube]] (PMT) is illustrated in the following figure.  The overall device is typically cylindrical in shape and the figure shows a cross-section through this cylinder:

[[Image:NM9_1.gif|thumb|center]]

The scintillation crystal, NaI(Tl) is very delicate and this is one of the reasons it is housed in an aluminium casing.  The inside wall of the casing is designed so that any light which strikes it is reflected downwards towards the PMT.

The PMT itself consists of a photocathode, a focussing grid, an array of dynodes and an anode housed in an evacuated glass tube.  The function of the photocathode is to convert the light flashes produced by radiation attenuation in the scintillation crystal into electrons.  The grid focuses these electrons onto the first dynode and the dynode array is used for electron multiplication.  We will consider this process in more detail below.  Finally the anode collects the electrons produced by the array of dynodes.

The electrical circuitry which is typically attached to a PMT is shown in the next figure:

[[Image:NM9_2.gif|thumb|center]]

It consists of a high voltage supply, a resistor divider chain and a load resistor, R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;.  The high voltage supply generates a dc voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;dc&lt;/sub&gt; which can be up to 1,000 volts.  It is applied to the resistor divider chain which consists of an array of resistors, each of which has the same resistance, R.  The function of this chain of resistors is to divide up V&lt;sub&gt;dc&lt;/sub&gt; into equal voltages which are supplied to the dynodes.  As a result voltages which increase in equal steps are applied to the array of dynodes.  The load resistor is used so that an output voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; can be generated.

Finally the operation of the device is illustrated in the figure below:

[[Image:NM9_3.gif|thumb|center]]

The ionizing radiation produces flashes of light in the scintillation crystal.  This light strikes the photocathode and is converted into electrons.  The electrons are directed by the grid onto the first dynode.

Dynodes are made from certain alloys which emit electrons when their surface is struck by electrons with the advantage that more electrons are emitted than are absorbed.  A dynode used in a PMT typically emits between two and five electrons for each electron which strikes it.

So when an electron from the photocathode strikes the first dynode between two and five electrons are emitted and are directed towards the second dynode in the array (three are illustrated in the figure).  This electron multiplication process is repeated at the second dynode so that we end up with nine electrons for example heading towards the third dynode.  An electron avalanche therefore develops so that a sizeable number of electrons eventually hits the anode at the bottom of the dynode chain.

These electrons flow through the load resistor, R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and constitute an electric current which according to Ohm's Law generates a voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; which is measured by electronic circuitry (which we will describe later).

A number of photographs of devices based on scintillation detection are shown below:

|}

The '''important feature''' of the scintillation detector is that this output voltage, V&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; is directly proportional to the energy deposited by the radiation in the crystal.  We will see what a useful feature this is below.  Before we do so we will briefly analyze the operation of this device.

== Mathematical Model ==

A simple mathematical model will be presented below which will help us get a better handle on the performance of a scintillation detector.  We will do this by quantifying the performance of the scintillator, the photocathode and the dynodes.  

Let's use the following symbols to characterize each stage of the detection process:

* ''m'': number of light photons produced in crystal
* ''k'': optical efficiency of the crystal, that is the efficiency with which the crystal transmits light
* ''l'': [[W:Quantum_efficiency|quantum efficiency]] of the photocathode, that is the efficiency with which the photocathode converts light photons to electrons
* ''n'': number of dynodes
* ''R'': dynode multiplication factor, that is the number of secondary electrons emitted by a dynode per primary electron absorbed.

Therefore the charge collected at the anode is given by the following equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q = m k l R^n e\,\!&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where ''e'':  the [[W:Electron_charge|electronic charge]].

For example supposing a 100 keV gamma-ray is absorbed in the crystal.  The number of light photons produced, m, might be about 1,000 for a typical scintillation crystal.  A typical crystal might have an optical efficiency, k, of 0.5 - in other words 50% of the light produced reaches the photocathode which might have a quantum efficiency of 0.15.  A typical PMT has ten dynodes and let us assume that the dynode multiplication factor is 4.5.

Therefore

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q = 1000(0.5)(0.15)(4.5^{10})(1.6 \cdot 10^{-19})\ \text{C}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore Q = 41 \cdot 10^{-12}\ \text{C}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\therefore Q \approx 40\ \text{pC}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This amount of charge is very small.  Even though we have used a sophisticated photodetector like a PMT we still end up with quite a small electrical signal.  

A very sensitive amplifier is therefore needed to amplify this signal.  This type of amplifier is generally called a '''pre-amplifier''' and we will refer to it again later.

== Output Voltage ==

We noted above that the voltage measured across the resistor, R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;,  is proportional to the energy deposited in the scintillation crystal by the radiation.  Let us consider how the radiation might deposit its energy in the crystal.

Let us consider a situation where gamma-rays are detected by the crystal.  We learnt in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Interaction_of_Radiation_with_Matter|Chapter 5]] that there were two interaction mechanisms involved in gamma-ray attenuation - the Photoelectric Effect and the Compton Effect.  You will remember that the Photoelectric Effect involves the total absorption of the energy of a gamma-ray, while the Compton Effect involves just partial absorption of this energy.  Since the output voltage of a scintillation detector is proportional to the energy deposited by the gamma-rays it is reasonable to expect that Photoelectric Effects in the crystal will generate distinct and relatively large output voltages and that Compton Effects will result in lower output voltages.

The usual way of presenting this information is by plotting a graph of the count rate versus the output voltage pulse height as shown in the following figure:

[[Image:NM9_8.gif|thumb|center]]

This plot illustrates what is obtained for a monoenergetic gamma-emitting radioisotope, for example &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc - which, as we have noted before emits a single gamma-ray with an energy of 140 keV.

Before we look at it in detail remember that we noted above that the output voltage from this detector is proportional to the energy deposited by the radiation in the crystal.  The horizontal axis can therefore be used to represent the output voltage or the gamma-ray energy.  Both of these quantities are shown in the figure to help with this discussion.  In addition note that this plot is often called a '''Gamma-Ray Energy Spectrum'''.

The figure above contains two regions.  One called the '''Photopeak''' and the other called the '''Compton Smear'''.  The Photopeak results because of Photoelectric absorption of the gamma-rays from the radioactive source - remember that we are dealing with a monoenergetic emitter in this example.  It consists of a peak representing the gamma-ray energy (140 keV in our example).  If our radioisotope emitted gamma-rays of two energies we would have two photopeaks in our spectrum and so on.  

Notice that the peak has a statistical spread.  This has to do with how good our detector is and we will not get into any detail about it here other than to note that the extent of this spread is a measure of the quality of our detector.  A high quality (and more expensive!) detector will have a narrower statistical spread in the photopeaks which it measures.

The other component of our spectrum is the Compton Smear.  It represents a range of output voltages which are lower than that for the Photopeak.  It is therefore indicative of the partial absorption of the energy of gamma-rays in the crystal.  In some Compton Effects a substantial scattering with a valance electron can occur which gives rise to relatively large voltage pulses.  In other Compton Effects the gamma-ray just grazes off a valance electron with minimal energy transfer and hence a relatively small voltage pulse is generated.  In between these two extremes are a range of scattering events involving a range of energy transfers and hence a range of voltage pulse heights.  A 'smear' therefore manifests itself on the gamma-ray energy spectrum.

It is important to note that the spectrum illustrated in the figure is simplified for the sake of this introductory discussion and that actual spectra are a little more complex - see figure below for an example:

[[Image:NM9_4a.gif|320px|center]]

You will find though that your understanding of actual spectra can easily develop on the basis of the simple picture we have painted here.

It is also important to appreciate the additional information which this type of radiation detector provides relative to a gas-filled detector.  In essence gas-filled detectors can be used to tell us if any radiation is present as well as the amount of that radiation.  Scintillation detectors also give us this information but they tell us about the '''energy''' of this radiation as well.  This additional information can be used for many diverse applications such as the identification of unknown radioisotopes and the production of nuclear medicine images.  Let us stay a little bit longer though with the fundamental features of how scintillation detectors work.

The photopeak of the Gamma-Ray Energy Spectrum is generally of interest in nuclear medicine.  This peak is the main signature of the radioisotope being used and its isolation from the Compton Smear is normally achieved using a technique called '''Pulse Height Analysis'''.

== Pulse Height Analysis ==

This is an electronic technique which allows a spectrum to be acquired using two types of circuitry.  One circuit is called a '''Lower Level Discriminator''' which only allows voltages pulses through it which are lower than its setting.  The other is called an '''Upper Level Discriminator''' which only allows voltage pulses though which are (you guessed it!) higher than its setting.

The result of using both these circuits in combination is a variable-width window which can be placed anywhere along a spectrum.  For example if we wished to obtain information from the photopeak only of our simplified spectrum we would place the discrimination controls as shown in the following figure:

[[Image:NM9_9.gif|thumb|center]]

A final point to note here is that since the scintillation detector is widely used to obtain information about the energies of the radiation emitted from a radioactive source it is frequently referred to as a '''Scintillation Spectrometer'''.

== Scintillation Spectrometer ==

Types of scintillation spectrometer fall into two basic categories - the relatively straight-forward '''Single Channel Analyser''' and the more sophisticated '''Multi-Channel Analyser'''.

The Single Channel Analyser is the type of instrument we have been describing so far in this discussion.  A block diagram of the instrument is shown below:

[[Image:NM9_10.gif|320px|center]]

It consists of a scintillation crystal coupled to a photomultiplier tube which is powered by a high voltage circuit (H.V.).  The output voltages are initially amplified by a sensitive pre-amplifier ('''Pre-Amp''') as we noted above before being amplified further and conditioned by the amplifier ('''Amp''').

The voltage pulses are then in a suitable form for the pulse height analyser ('''P.H.A.''') - the output pulses from which can be fed to a '''Scaler''' and a '''Ratemeter''' for display of the information about the portion of the spectrum we have allowed to pass through the PHA.  The Ratemeter is a display device just like the speedometer in a car and indicates the number of pulses generated per unit time.  The Scaler on the other hand usually consists of a digital display which shows the number of voltage pulses produced in a specified period of time.

We can illustrate the operation of this circuitry by considering how it might be used to generate a Gamma-Ray Energy Spectrum.  What we would do is set up the LLD and ULD so as to define a narrow window and place this to pass the lowest voltage pulses produced by the detector through to the Scaler and Ratemeter.  In other words we would place a narrow window at the extreme left of the spectrum and acquire information about the lowest energy gamma-ray interactions in the crystal.  We would then adjust the LLD and ULD settings to acquire information about the interactions of the next highest energy.  We would proceed in this fashion to scan the whole spectrum.

A more sophisticated detector circuit is illustrated in the following figure:

[[Image:NM9_11.gif|320px|center]]

It is quite similar to that in the previous figure with the exception that the PHA, Scaler and Ratemeter are replaced by a Multi-Channel Analyser and a computer.  The Multi-Channel Analyser ('''MCA''') is a circuit which is capable of setting up a large number of individual windows to look at a complete spectrum in one go.  The MCA might consist of 1024 individual windows for example and the computer might consist of a personal computer which can acquire information simultaneously from each window and display it as an energy spectrum.  The computer generally contains software which allows us to manipulate the resultant information in a variety of ways.  Indeed the &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs spectrum shown above was generated using this approach.

Topics we have covered in this wikibook have included radioactivity, the interaction of gamma-rays with matter and radiation detection.  The main reason for following this pathway was to bring us to the subject of this chapter: nuclear medicine imaging systems.  These are devices which produce pictures of the distribution of radioactive material following administration to a patient.

The radioactivity is generally administered to the patient in the form of a [[W:Radiopharmaceutical|radiopharmaceutical]] - the term '''radiotracer''' is also used.  This follows some physiological pathway to accumulate for a short period of time in some part of the body.  A good example is &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-tin colloid which following intravenous injection accumulates mainly in the patient's liver.  The substance emits gamma-rays while it is in the patient's liver and we can produce an image of its distribution using a nuclear medicine imaging system.  This image can tell us whether the function of the liver is normal or abnormal or if sections of it are damaged from some form of disease.  

Different radiopharmaceuticals are used to produce images from almost every region of the body:

Note that the form of information obtained using this imaging method is mainly related to the physiological functioning of an organ as opposed to the mainly anatomical information which is obtained using X-ray imaging systems.  Nuclear medicine therefore provides a different perspective on a disease condition and generates additional information to that obtained from X-ray images.  Our purpose here is to concentrate on the imaging systems used to produce the images.

Early forms of imaging system used in this field consisted of a radiation detector (a scintillation detector for example) which was scanned slowly over a region of the patient in order to measure the radiation intensity emitted from individual points within the region.  One such device was called the [[W:Rectilinear_scanner|Rectilinear Scanner]].  Such imaging systems have been replaced since the 1970s by more sophisticated devices which produce images much more rapidly.  The most common of these modern devices is called the [[W:Gamma_camera|Gamma Camera]] and we will consider its construction and mode of operation below.  A review of recent developments in this technology for cardiac applications can be found in Slomka et al (2009)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;Slomka PJ, Patton JA, Berman DS &amp; Germano G, 2009.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19242769 Advances in technical aspects of myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology, 16(2), 255–76.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Gamma Camera ==

The basic design of the most common type of gamma camera used today was developed by an American physicist, [[W:Hal_Anger|Hal Anger]] and is therefore sometimes called the Anger Camera.  It consists of a large diameter NaI(Tl) scintillation crystal which is viewed by a large number of photomultiplier tubes.

A block diagram of the basic components of a gamma camera is shown below:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM10_1.gif|frame|center|Block diagram of a gamma camera]]&lt;/center&gt;

The crystal and PM Tubes are housed in a cylindrical shaped housing commonly called the '''camera head''' and a cross-sectional view of this is shown in the figure.  The crystal can be between about 25 cm and 40 cm in diameter and about 1 cm thick.  The diameter is dependent on the application of the device.  For example a 25 cm diameter crystal might be used for a camera designed for cardiac applications while a larger 40 cm crystal would be used for producing images of the lungs.  The thickness of the crystal is chosen so that it provides good detection for the 140 keV gamma-rays emitted from &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc - which is the most common radioisotope used today.

Scintillations produced in the crystal are detected by a large number of PM tubes which are arranged in a two-dimensional array.  There is typically between 37 and 91 PM tubes in modern gamma cameras.  The output voltages generated by these PM tubes are fed to a position circuit which produces four output signals called ±X and ±Y.  These position signals contain information about where the scintillations were produced within the crystal.  In the most basic gamma camera design they are fed to a [[W:Oscilloscope|cathode ray oscilloscope]] ('''CRO''').  We will describe the operation of the CRO in more detail below.

Before we do so we should note that the position signals also contain information about the intensity of each scintillation.  This intensity information can be derived from the position signals by feeding them to a summation circuit (marked ∑ in the figure) which adds up the four position signals to generate a voltage pulse which represents the intensity of a scintillation.  This voltage pulse is commonly called the '''Z-pulse''' (or zee-pulse in American English!) which following pulse height analysis ('''PHA''') is fed as the '''unblank pulse''' to the CRO.

So we end up with four position signals and an unblank pulse sent to the CRO.  Let us briefly review the operation of a CRO before we continue.  The core of a CRO consists of an evacuated tube with an electron gun at one end and a phosphor-coated screen at the other end.  The electron gun generates an electron beam which is directed at the screen and the screen emits light at those points struck by the electron beam.  The position of the electron beam can be controlled by vertical and horizontal deflection plates and with the appropriate voltages fed to these plates the electron beam can be positioned at any point on the screen.  The normal mode of operation of an oscilloscope is for the electron beam to remain switched on.  In the case of the gamma camera the electron beam of the CRO is normally switched off - it is said to be '''blanked'''.

When an unblank pulse is generated by the PHA circuit the electron beam of the CRO is switched on for a brief period of time so as to display a flash of light on the screen.  In other words the voltage pulse from the PHA circuit is used to unblank the electron beam of the CRO.

So where does this flash of light occur on the screen of the CRO?  The position of the flash of light is dictated by the ±X and ±Y signals generated by the position circuit.  These signals as you might have guessed are fed to the deflection plates of the CRO so as to cause the unblanked electron beam to strike the screen at a point related to where the scintillation was originally produced in the NaI(Tl) crystal.  Simple!

The gamma camera can therefore be considered to be a sophisticated arrangement of electronic circuits used to translate the position of a flash of light in a scintillation crystal to a flash of light at a related point on the screen of an oscilloscope.  In addition the use of a pulse height analyser in the circuitry allows us to translate the scintillations related only to photoelectric events in the crystal by rejecting all voltage pulses except those occurring within the photopeak of the gamma-ray energy spectrum.

Let us '''summarise''' where we have got to before we proceed.  A radiopharmaceutical is administered to the patient and it accumulates in the organ of interest.  Gamma-rays are emitted in all directions from the organ and those heading in the direction of the gamma camera enter the crystal and produce scintillations (note that there is a device in front of the crystal called a '''collimator''' which we will discuss later).  The scintillations are detected by an array of PM tubes whose outputs are fed to a position circuit which generates four voltage pulses related to the position of a scintillation within the crystal.  These voltage pulses are fed to the deflection circuitry of the CRO.  They are also fed to a summation circuit whose output (the Z-pulse) is fed to the PHA and the output of the PHA is used to switch on (that is, unblank) the electron beam of the CRO.  A flash of light appears on the screen of the CRO at a point related to where the scintillation occurred within the NaI(Tl) crystal.  An image of the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical within the organ is therefore formed on the screen of the CRO when the gamma-rays emitted from the organ are detected by the crystal.

What we have described above is the operation of a fairly traditional gamma camera.  Modern designs are a good deal more complex but the basic design has remained much the same as has been described.  One area where major design improvements have occurred is the area of image formation and display.  The most basic approach to image formation is to photograph the screen of the CRO over a period of time to allow integration of the light flashes to form an image on [[W:Photographic_film|photographic film]].  A stage up from this is to use a [[W:Storage_tube|storage oscilloscope]] which allows each flash of light to remain on the screen for a reasonable period of time.

The most modern approach is to feed the position and energy signals into the memory circuitry of a computer for storage.  The memory contents can therefore be displayed on a computer monitor and can also be manipulated (that is '''processed''') in many ways.  For example various colours can be used to represent different concentrations of a radiopharmaceutical within an organ.

The use of [[W:Digital_image_processing|digital image processing]] is now widespread in nuclear medicine in that it can be used to rapidly and conveniently control image acquisition and display as well as to analyse an image or sequences of images, to annotate images with the patient's name and examination details, to store the images for subsequent retrieval and to communicate the image data to other computers over a [[W:Computer_networking|network]].

The essential elements of a modern gamma camera are shown in the next figure. Gamma rays emitted by the patient pass through the collimator and are detected within the camera head, which generates data related to the location of scintillations in the crystal as well as to the energy of the gamma rays. This data is then processed on-the-fly by electronic hardware which corrects for technical factors such as spatial linearity, PM tube drift and energy response so as to produce an imaging system with a spatially-uniform sensitivity and distortion-free performance.

A multichannel analyzer (MCA) is used to display the energy spectrum of gamma rays which interact inside the crystal.  Since these gamma rays originate from within the patient, some of them will have an energy lower than the photopeak as a result of being scattered as they travel through the patient's tissues - and by other components such as the patient table and structures of the imaging system.  Some of these scattering events may involve just glancing interactions with free electrons, so that the gamma rays lose only a small amount of energy.  These gamma rays may have an energy just below that of the photopeak so that their spectrum merges with the photopeak.  The photopeak for a gamma camera imaging a patient therefore contains information from spatially-correlated, unattenuated gamma rays (which is the information we want) and from spatially-uncorrelated, scattered gamma rays.  The scattered gamma rays act like a variable background within the true photopeak data and the effect is that of a background haze in gamma camera images.  

[[Image:simpleGammaCamera.gif|thumb|400px|center|Essential elements of a modern gamma camera.  MCA: Multi-Channel Analyzer]]

While scatter may not be a significant problem in planar scintigraphy, it has a strong bearing on the fidelity of quantitative information derived from gamma camera images and is a vital consideration for accurate image reconstruction in emission tomography.  It is the unattenuated gamma rays (also called the &lt;b&gt;primary&lt;b&gt; radiation) that contain the desired information, because of their direct dependence on radioactivity.

The scatter situation is illustrated in more detail in the figure below, which shows estimates of the primary and scatter spectra for &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc in patient imaging conditions.  Such spectral estimates can be generated using [[W:Monte_Carlo_method|Monte Carlo]] methods. It is seen in the figure that the energy of the scattered radiation forms a broad band, similar to the [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Scintillation_Detectors#Output_Voltage|Compton Smear]] described previously, which merges into and contributes substantially to the detected photopeak.  The detected photopeak is therefore an overestimate of the primary radiation.  The extent of this overestimate is likely to be dependent on the specific imaging situation because of the different thicknesses of tissues involved.  It is clear however that the scatter contribution within the detected photopeak needs to be accounted for if an accurate measure of radioactivity is required. 

[[Image:tcScatterSpectrum.gif|thumb|400px|center|Detected gamma ray energy spectrum for &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc (green) with estimates of the scatter (blue) and primary (red) components.]]

One method of compensating for the scatter contribution is illustrated in the figure below and involves using data from a lower energy window as an estimate for subtraction from the photopeak, i.e.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Primary Counts = &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Photopeak Window Counts&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt; - k (&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;Scatter Window Counts&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where k is a scaling factor to account for the extent of the scatter contribution.  This approach to scatter compensation is referred to as the &lt;b&gt;Dual-Energy Window&lt;/b&gt; (DEW) method.  It can be implemented in practice by acquiring two images, one for each energy window, and subtracting a fraction (k) of the scatter image from the photopeak image.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the spectrum shown above, it can be seen that the scaling factor, k, is about 0.5, but it should be appreciated that its exact value is dependent on the scattering conditions.  Gamma cameras which use the DEW method therefore generally provide the capability of adjusting k for different imaging situations.  Some systems use a narrower scatter window than that illustrated, e.g. 114-126 keV, with a consequent increase in k to about 1.0, for instance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A host of other methods of scatter compensation have also been developed.  These include more complex forms of energy analysis such as the &lt;b&gt;Dual-Photopeak&lt;/b&gt; and the &lt;b&gt;Triple-Energy Window&lt;/b&gt; techniques, as well as approaches based on deconvolution and models of photon attenuation.  An excellent review of these developments is provided in [http://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;cluster=9162820602187203874 Zaidi &amp; Koral (2004)].

We will continue with our description of the gamma camera by considering the construction and purpose of the collimator.

== Collimation ==

The [[W:Collimator|collimator]] is a device which is attached to the front of the gamma camera head.  It functions something like a lens used in a photographic camera but this analogy is not quite correct because it is rather difficult to focus gamma-rays.  Nevertheless in its simplest form it is used to block out all gamma rays which are heading towards the crystal except those which are travelling at right angles to the plane of the crystal:

[[Image:NM10_2.gif|thumb|360px|center|Diagram of parallel-hole collimator attached to a crystal of a gamma camera. Obliquely incident gamma-rays are absorbed by the septa.]]

The figure illustrates a magnified view of a '''parallel-hole collimator''' attached to a crystal.  The collimator simply consists of a large number of small holes drilled in a lead plate.  Notice that gamma-rays entering at an angle to the crystal get absorbed by the lead and that only those entering along the direction of the holes get through to cause scintillations in the crystal.  If the collimator was not in place these obliquely incident gamma-rays would blur the images produced by the gamma camera.  In other words the images would not be very clear.

Most gamma cameras have a number of collimators which can be fitted depending on the examination.  The basic design of these collimators is the same except that they vary in terms of the diameter of each hole, the depth of each hole and the thickness of lead between each hole (commonly called the '''septum thickness''').  The choice of a specific collimator is dependent on the amount of radiation absorption that occurs (which influences the '''sensitivity''' of the gamma camera), and the clarity of images (that is the '''spatial resolution''') it produces.  Unfortunately these two factors are inversely related in that the use of a collimator which produces images of good spatial resolution generally implies that the instrument is not very sensitive to radiation.

Other collimator designs beside the parallel hole type are also in use.  For example a '''diverging''' hole collimator produces a minified image and '''converging''' hole and '''pin-hole''' collimators produce a magnified image.  The pin-hole collimator is illustrated in the following figure:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:NM10_3.gif|thumb|360px|center|Diagram of a pin-hole collimator illustrating the inversion of acquired images.]]&lt;/center&gt;

It is typically a cone-shaped device with its walls made from lead.  A cross-section through this cone is shown in the figure.  It operates in a similar fashion to a [[W:Pin_hole_camera|pin-hole photographic camera]] and produces an inverted image of an object - an arrow is used in the figure to illustrate this inversion.  This type of collimator has been found useful for imaging small objects such as the thyroid gland.

== Emission Tomography ==

The form of imaging which we have been describing is called '''Planar Imaging'''.  It produces a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object.  As a result images contain no depth information and some details can be superimposed on top of each other and obscured or partially obscured as a result.  Note that this is also a feature of conventional X-ray imaging.

The usual way of trying to overcome this limitation is to take at least two views of the patient, one from the front and one from the side for example.  So in chest radiography a posterio-anterior (PA) and a lateral view can be taken.  And in a nuclear medicine liver scan an antero-posterior (AP) and lateral scan are acquired.

This limitation of planar X-ray imaging was overcome by the development of the [[W:CAT_scan|CAT Scanner]] about 1970 or thereabouts.  CAT stands for Computerized Axial Tomography or Computer Assisted Tomography and today the term is often shortened to Computed Tomography or CT scanning (the term tomography comes from the Greek word &lt;i&gt;tomos&lt;/i&gt; meaning '''slice''').  Irrespective of its exact name the technique allows images of slices through the body to be produced using a computer.  It does this in essence by taking X-ray images at a number of angles around the patient.  These slice images show the third dimension which is missing from planar images and thus eliminate the problem of superimposed details.  Furthermore images of a number of successive slices through a region of the patient can be stacked on top of each other using the computer to produce a [[W:CAT_scan#Three_dimensional_.283D.29_reconstruction|three-dimensional image]].  Clearly CT scanning is a very powerful imaging technique relative to planar imaging.

The equivalent nuclear medicine imaging technique is called '''Emission Computed Tomography'''.  We will consider two implementations of this technique below.

==== Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) ====

:This [[W:Single_photon_emission_computed_tomography|SPECT]] technique uses a gamma camera to record images at a series of angles around the patient.  These images are then subjected to a form of digital image processing called [[W:Reconstruction_algorithm|Image Reconstruction]] in order to compute images of slices through the patient.

:The [[W:Filtered_back_projection|Back Projection]] reconstruction process is illustrated below.  Let us assume for simplicity that the slice through the patient actually consists of a 2x2 voxel array with the radioactivity in each voxel given by A1...A4:

[[Image:recon2x2.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Illustration of the acquisition of four projections around the patient, P1...P4]]

:The first projection, P1, is imaged from the right and the second projection, P2, from the right oblique and so on.  The back projection process involves firstly adding the projections to each other as shown below:

[[Image:bpSum.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Illustration of the back projection computation process.]]

:and then normalising the summed (or superimposed) projections to generate an estimate of the radioactivity in each voxel.  Since this process can generate streaking artefacts in reconstructed images, the projections are generally filtered prior to back projection, as described in a [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Fourier_Methods#Filtered_Backprojection|later chapter]], with the overall process referred to as Filtered Back Projection (FBP):

[[Image:fbpProcess.jpg|thumb|320px|center|Illustration of the filtered back projection computation process.]]

:An alternative image reconstruction technique is called [[W:Iterative_reconstruction|Iterative Reconstruction]].  This is a successive approximation technique as illustrated below:

|}

:The first estimate of the image matrix is made by distributing the first projection, P1, evenly through an empty pixel matrix.  The second projection, P2, is compared to the same projection from the estimated matrix and the difference between actual and estimated projections is added to the estimated matrix.  The process is repeated for all other projections.

:The Maximum-Likelihood Expectation-Maximisation (ML-EM) algorithm is a refinement to this iterative approach where a division process is used to compare the actual and estimated projections, as shown below:

[[Image:mlemIterRecon.jpg|thumb|480px|center|Illustration of the Maximum-Likelihood Expectation-Maximisation (ML-EM) algorithm.]]

:One cycle of data through this processing chain is referred to as one &lt;b&gt;iteration&lt;/b&gt;.  Sixteen or more iterations can be required in order to generate an adequate reconstruction and, as a result, computation times can be rather long.  The [[W:Ordered_subset_expectation_maximization|Ordered-Subsets Expectation-Maximisation]] (OS-EM) algorithm can be used to substantially reduce the computation time by utilising a limited number of projections (called &lt;b&gt;subsets&lt;/b&gt;) in a sequential fashion within the iterative process.  Noise generated during the reconstruction process can be reduced, for example, using a Gaussian filter built into the reconstruction calculations or applied as a post-filter:

[[Image:irProcess.jpg|thumb|480px|center|Illustration of an Iterative Reconstruction process.]]&lt;br&gt;

:A comparison of these image reconstruction techniques is shown below for a slice through a ventilation scan of a patient's lungs:

[[Image:fbpiRComp.jpg|thumb|480px|center]]

:The gamma camera is typiclly rotated around the patient in order to acquire the images.  Modern gamma cameras which are designed specifically for SPECT scanning can consist of two camera heads mounted parallel to each other with the patient in between.  The time required to produce images is therefore reduced by a factor of about two.  In addition some SPECT gamma cameras designed for brain scanning have three camera heads mounted in a triangular arrangement.

:A wide variety of strategies can be used for the acquisition and processing of SPECT images.

==== Positron Emission Tomography (PET) ====

:You will remember from [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Radioactive_Decay|chapter 2]] that positrons can be emitted from radioactive nuclei which have too many neutrons for stability.  You will also remember that positrons do not last for very long in matter since they will quickly encounter an electron and a process called '''annihilation''' results.  In the process the positron and electron vanish and their energy is converted into two gamma-rays which are emitted at roughly 180&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; degrees to each other.  The emission is often referred to as two '''back-to-back''' gamma-rays and they each have a discrete energy of 0.51 MeV.

:So if we administer a positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical to a patient an emitted positrons can annihilate with a nearby electron and two gamma-rays will be emitted in opposite directions.  These gamma-rays can be detected using a ring of radiation detectors encircling the patient and tomographic images can be generated using a computer system.  The detectors are typically specialised scintillation devices which are optimised for detection of the 0.51 MeV gamma-rays.  This ring of detectors, associated apparatus and computer system are called a [[W:PET_scanner|PET Scanner]]:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:petDiag2.jpg|320px]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

:The locations of positron decays within the patient are highlighted by the solid circles in the above diagram.  In addition only a few detectors are shown in the diagram for reasons of clarity.  Each detector around the ring is operated in coincidence with a bank of opposing detectors and the annihilation gamma-rays thus detected are used to build up a single profile.

:It has also been found that gamma cameras fitted with thick crystals and special collimators can be used for PET scanning.

:The radioisotopes used for PET scanning include &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;N, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F.  These isotopes are usually produced using an instrument called a [[W:Cyclotron|cyclotron]].  In addition these isotopes have relatively short half lives.  PET scanning therefore needs a cyclotron and associated radiopharmaceutical production facilities located close by.  We will consider cyclotrons in the  [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Production_of_Radioisotopes|next chapter]] of this wikibook.

:Standardized Uptake Value ('''SUV''') is a semi-quantitative index used in PET to express the uptake of a radiopharmaceutical in a region of interest of a patient's scan.  Its typically calculated as the ratio of the radioactivity in the region to the injected dose, corrected for body weight.  It should be noted that the SUV is influenced by several major sources of variability and it therefore should not be used as a quantitative measure.

{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1i}}

====The verbs έχω, ''to have,'' and  είμαι, ''to be''====
Two important verbs are  έχω, ''to have,'' and  είμαι, ''to be.''  The first-conjugation verb  έχω is regular
in the present tense, so it has the same endings as  γράφω.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#{{Modern Greek/table_audio_color}}&quot;

|-
|}
{{Modern_Greek/audio_nonnative|which=1j}}

''To be'' in English is expressed
in the active voice, but the Greek  είμαι is passive, and doesn't have an active form.
The ending  -μαι is a typical, regular ending for passive verbs.

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

This is in response to: ''The question is whether it is better to have the Dialog in the second lesson but be unable to fully explain it. Or to have it later and be able to explain everything.--[[User:IKnowNothing|IKnowNothing]] 20:49, 5 June 2006 (UTC)''

I believe that every lesson should contain a text or dialogue, because many people are unable to understand grammar and apply it if they don't see it in use. Also, seeing how the stuff taught in one lesson helps one get by in a real-life situation is a very motivating factor for the learner.

I am sure that it would be possible to start every lesson (except the one teaching the alphabet) with a small dialogue, without introducing too much grammar or vocabulary at once. German is similar in grammar complexity as Greek and see how it was accomplished there: [[BLL German/A1]]. Also see my comment to the discussion at the main Modern Greek page. 

Mind you, it's even easier to have a meaningful text or dialogue in each lesson if you're ready to introduce several conjugated forms or several cases at once. I still believe that splitting is the key to learner motivation though, particularly for those who haven't studied Latin yet. To provide a general overview of every difficulty a language has to offer on a particular area of grammar is the task of a grammar book, not a language course. You could link to the complete tables for those who'd rather try to memorise everything at once.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

“Virtual teams are groups of geographically and/or temporally dispersed individuals brought together via information and telecommunication technologies.” (Piccoli and Ives, 2003, p365)  Virtual teams are increasingly becoming a key feature of projects in modern organizations, while the landscape of communication tools continues to change dramatically.  The benefits of virtualization include diversity of perspectives, large member selection pool, extended hours of productivity, and reduced transportation costs.

However, many new challenges arise, such as difficulty in performance monitoring, disappearance of social cues, member isolation and anonymity, and technology issues.  In addition, virtual teams must deal with cultural, temporal, and geographic barriers.  Using a framework based on Larson and LaFasto’s ''Teamwork'', conventional team strategies have been adapted for the virtual context to help virtual team leaders and members overcome these challenges.

== A Clear and Elevating Goal ==

Larson and LaFasto (1989) stress the importance of a clear and elevating goal in the performance of an effective team.  They define goal clarity as “a specific performance objective, phrased in such concrete language that it is possible to tell, unequivocally, whether or not that performance objective has been attained” (p28) and elevating as “personally or collectively” challenging and that it “makes a difference.” (p31)  While Larson and LaFasto consider this to possibly be the most important component of an effectively functioning team, it appears to be even more critical for a virtual team.  

To stress this point, Kirkman and Rosen, et al. (2002) quote a team member from Sabre, Inc. as saying “virtual teams need to understand much more so than co-located teams what goal they are working towards because you are working in such different areas, and in our case, in different countries. It plays a much stronger role if you know what your ultimate target is going to be. Everyone is working towards the same thing.”  Further work on the performance of virtual teams by Kirkman and Rosen, et al. (2004) demonstrates a positive correlation between empowerment and virtual team performance.  They define empowerment as having four dimensions, two of which, potency and impact significantly overlap the concepts of goal clarity and elevation.  

This research therefore supports and elevates the arguments made by Larson and LaFasto about the importance of a clear and elevating goal for virtual teams.  Virtual team managers should make sure to have a clear and elevating goal for the group and should make sure to prominently display the team mission statement on the virtual work space, team web-site, and other electronic communications to the group.

== Results-Driven Structure ==

Team structure is a key factor which differentiates successful teams from unsuccessful ones.  Team structure encompasses many aspects such as tools, processes, communications systems, facilities, and organization of the team.  However, the best structure depends on the objectives and composition of the team.

Virtual teams tend to be very effective in project development tasks.  However, the lack of face to face contact can be a challenge in building consensus.  For decision-making teams, having the right team composition can help to overcome this.  Collectivistic teams have higher levels of collaborative conflict management than individualistic teams, and are motivated more by outcomes which benefit the entire team. (Paul, et al, 2005)  

Research has also shown that highly diverse or heterogeneous teams outperform homogenous teams in many performance measures, though they take longer to reach consensus.  Virtuality can be beneficial for highly diverse teams since it obfuscates potentially divisive demographic differences. (Kirkman et al, 2002)

Larson and LaFasto outlined four necessary features of effective team structure, which apply equally to virtual teams, but become more challenging.  

First, team members must have clear roles and accountabilities.  Lack of visibility may cause virtual team members to feel less accountable for results, therefore explicit facilitation of teamwork takes on heightened importance for virtual teams. Temporal coordination mechanisms such as scheduling deadlines and coordinating the pace of effort are recommended to increase vigilance and accountability.  (Massey, Montoya-Weiss, and Hung, 2003) 

Second, teams require effective communications systems.  This is especially important for virtual teams because geographic and temporal differences may rule out the most common communication channels.  “Many in our study found e-mail a poor way for teams as a whole to collaborate.” (Majchzak et al, 2004)  Individual email conversations cause others to feel left out, but copying everyone causes email overload.  Sharing documents over email often leads to conflicting versions.  Many successful teams prefer to use virtual work spaces, online forums, instant messaging, and file repositories.  Regardless of the communication system, team norms and rewards structures should support use of the systems.

Third, effective teams should monitor individual performance and provide feedback.  Assessment and development of virtual team members is very limited in the virtual environment.  Performance management is an enormous challenge when employees are out of sight.  Managers should monitor group communication to assess subjective factors such as idea generation, leadership, and problem-solving skills. (Kirkman et al, 2002)  Utilizing peer and customer feedback helps assess contributions to team effectiveness.  Managers should also consider using &quot;richer&quot; communication media (such as video conferencing) to more effectively deliver evaluation feedback.

Finally, teams must rely on fact-based decision making, for which information and communication tools are vital.  Teams can adapt decision-making software to facilitate fact-based problem solving and decision-making.  (Kirkman et al, 2002)  They might also assign one person to ensure accurate information is clearly communicated (Piccoli and Ives, 2003).  Rocketdyne, for example, used collaborative technology to manage knowledge.  They allowed all communications to be recorded and all information to be visible to the team, and even prohibited face to face discussions. (Malhotra, Majchzak, Carmen, Lott)

== Members ==

Larson and LaFasto recognize three common features of competent team members: technical skills and abilities, desire to contribute, and capability of collaborating effectively.  Virtual teams amplify the importance of using appropriate criteria when selecting people for the team.
 
A critical element in high-performance teams is creating functional diversity among team members, while productively managing resulting task conflict.  Work group studies suggest that “such conflict evidently fosters a deeper understanding of task issues and an exchange of information that facilitates problem solving, decision making, and the generation of ideas.”  (Pelled, et al, 1999, p22)  A best-practice study of successful virtual teams concludes that diversity among disciplines, working styles, and problem-solving approaches can be exploited to produce “solutions instead of acrimony.”  (Majchrzak, et al, 2004, p133)  Conflict researchers have found that task conflicts can improve team performance if managed collaboratively.  (Weingart and Jehn, 2000)

However, regardless of other qualifications, not everyone can handle the social isolation of a virtual team.  Maintaining this challenging environment requires selection of team members with interpersonal skills, self-regulatory skills, a high level of knowledge, and comfort with technology.  (Gibson and Cohen, 2003)  This critical balance between technical and interpersonal skills must include the ability to work with others to identify, address, and resolve issues.

Managers should consider using behavioral interviewing techniques and simulations to select team members with unique areas of competence that will contribute to a high-quality solution.  Ideally some members should have team process backgrounds.  Managers should also provide potential team members with a realistic assessment of virtual team challenges, and the choice to opt out.

== Unified Commitment ==

Larson and LaFasto suggest that lack of unified commitment is often the most important feature of ineffective teams.  They identify two key elements: dedication to the endeavor (commitment) and dedication to the team (unity).

High-performance teams are distinguished by passionate dedication to goals, identification and emotional bonding among team members, and a balance between unity and respect for individual differences. Virtual teams face the challenge of developing and sustaining unified commitment in the absence of face-to-face contact.  In particular, they must identify and deal with the most serious threat, competition between individual and team goals.

Kerber and Buono recommend appointing a strong team leader, willing to maintain frequent contact with team members, take full advantage of collaborative technologies, demonstrate a high level of personal commitment, and deal quickly with self-serving and non-contributing team members.  Larson and LaFasto suggest that commitment can be enhanced by involving team members in project planning and in defining team identity, goals, and processes.  Virtual team leaders should identify commonalities among members early on, while focusing the team on achieving key performance objectives and providing a clear context for recognizing team success.

Finally, interdependence of goals, tasks, and outcomes among members of virtual teams can overcome motivational challenges, particularly early on.  (Hertel, et al, 2004)  Virtual team managers can create the experience of connectedness by delegating goal setting, assigning interdependent tasks, and rewarding both personal contributions and team performance.

== Collaborative Climate ==

“Collaboration flourishes in a climate of trust.” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 87)  Trust is based on social characteristics (familiarity, competence), immediate outcomes of interaction processes (reliability, integrity), and institutions (social norms, policies).  Studies have shown that while trust has little impact on task performance, it can significantly reduce process losses. (Jarvenpaa, Shaw, Staples, 2004)

Trust affects how we interpret member behavior.  “Trust is the lens through which these factors are interpreted.” (Jarvenpaa, Shaw, and Staples, 2004, p253)  Therefore trust plays an important role in virtual teams where ambiguity is high.  Unfortunately, building trust is an enormous challenge for virtual teams.  &quot;In virtual organizations, trust requires constant face-to-face interaction—the very activity the virtual form eliminates.&quot; (Kirkman et al, 2002)  Structured opportunities for socialization are less satisfying in virtual environments, and slow development of relational ties.

When a team is formed, expectations about workloads, processes, and contributions lead to “psychological contracts” which can damage trust when broken. (Piccoli and Ives, 2003)  Reneging and incongruence are heightened for virtual teams due to the limited ability to communicate.
  
Studies show that in high-trust teams, structured behavior control mechanisms (rules, progress reports, explicit assignments) intensify the negative effects of reneging and incongruence because they increase salience of member behavior. (Piccoli and Ives, 2003)  However, in low-trust teams strong structures actually mitigate the negative effects of trust by minimizing the role trust plays in interpreting member behavior.

Trust is not always dependent on social bonds.  Instead, it can be founded on performance consistency.  Task-based trust (vs. interpersonal trust) may be more achievable for virtual teams, and can be built by developing norms around communication patterns, ensuring reliable and rapid responses, and making team interaction timely and consistent. (Kirkman et al, 2002)

== Standards of Excellence and External Support ==

Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.  Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.  They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams may meet according to varying time zones which may not be understood by their local management.  The presence of a true “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team. The “invisible team” is the management team to which each of the members report.  The invisible team sets the standards for each member.

Misunderstandings may arise if the “invisible team” does not align itself to the same set of expectations.  A virtual team leader must understand the level and kind of support from each contributor.  Larson and LaFasto observe that “loss of morale…decreased belief and commitment to the team’s goal” (p110) result when support is not visible to the team.  The team leader should consider what expectations are reasonable to ask of members.  Virtual teams that span various companies must create some form of “shared understanding” (Symons, 1997, p427) in order for members to develop a set of expectations.  Failure to establish understanding may result in standards that are not achievable by all members.
  
External support frequently determines how resources, such as incentives and capital expenses, are contributed by team members.  During the Rocketdyne-Boeing Project, expectations of each member were established at the outset of the project. (Malhotra, Majchzak, Carmen, Lott)  Resolving how each member would contribute time, resources, and expertise reduced misunderstandings as the project progressed.
 
Standards of excellence and external support intersect on many levels.  Time and energy is well spent at the outset of a virtual team to evaluate the level of excellence the team will achieve.  This is especially true when financial contributions require resources outside of the control of the virtual team.  Managers of virtual teams need to understand the feasibility of their requests given the context of their members’ management.  

== Leadership ==

Principled Leadership is the final ingredient identified by Larson and LaFasto (1989) for effective team performance.  Pauleen (2004) tells us “leadership challenges are magnified in a virtual environment” and stresses the necessity of face-to-face meetings, stating “it is essential for them (leaders) to build personal relationships with team members before commencing a virtual working relationship.  Strong relational links are associated with trust, creativity, motivation, morale, good decisions, and fewer process losses.
  
However, Majchrzak, et al. (2004) argues that you can lead high-performing virtual teams without face-to-face meetings and provides several examples of successful teams whose members never met in person.  This requires intensive communications to build a coherent identity and hold the team together, and their research found that the leaders of successful virtual teams “rarely let a day go by when members did not communicate with one another” and “frequent phone conversations between the team leader and individual members …were not unusual.”
Research by Kirkman and Rosen, et al (2004) on the performance of virtual teams may provide a clue for leaders attempting to resolve this dilemma.  They suggest that periodic face-to-face be held to focus on process improvement, but if this is not feasible “managers need to make extra efforts to empower virtual teams to deal directly and decisively with process improvement issues” (p. 188).

Gibson and Cohen (2003) suggest virtual team leaders need to engage the group in openly discussing cultural differences and similarities to help develop communication norms.  Thompson’s (2000) work suggests the leader of a virtual team must also play a key role in assessing and balancing team performance levels across the four dimensions: team productivity; team satisfaction; individual growth; and organizational gains.  Pauleen (2004) states that the leader of a virtual team must:  assess team issues, boundaries, organizational policies, resources, and technology; target relationship levels necessary for performance; and develop effective strategies and select and utilize appropriate communication channels.

== Conclusions ==

Virtual teams must deal with problems that befall face-to-face teams, along with some unique challenges.  At the same time, they have the potential to realize additional process gains and deliver high-quality solutions by bringing together diverse individuals with complementary knowledge without the limitations of physical, organizational or cultural boundaries.

Our competitive environment places a premium on the quality and speed of solutions, and technology is providing increasingly richer collaboration tools – advancing from the telephone and the fax machine to video conferencing and virtual workspaces in a little over a decade.  Organizations that learn to harness the power of virtual teams with these collaborative technologies will gain significant competitive advantage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Age target of this Wikibook ==

The way that this has been written seems to be targeted to a much older audience than the typical Wikijunior book.  I would put the content and the questions to be typical American High School at the moment (ages 14-18).  While this is a laudable goal, it would be good to try and determine exactly who this is aiming at.  It needs to be toned down considerably in terms of word complexity and perhaps even the level of the questions if it is to be made for the more typical age range of Wikijunior books.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:32, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

:Do you have any suggestions then? As I have attempted to tone it down already.

::I would strongly suggest that you read through some of the comments with [[Wikijunior Solar System]] and the attempts to lower the target age of the content there.  It is not an easy process, and it takes some effort to accomplish.  The real issue is that you have to reduce the complexity of the words that are used, avoiding the larger multi-syllabic words and instead use simplier words that are more commonly used by English speakers.  The specific formula or metric to determine what the grade level of content is can be argued, but there are several formulas and websites that cover this idea on how to determine what age a given set of prose is intended for.&lt;p&gt;Also useful to try and cover is some specific curriculum guidelines by a school district or state education system (given the American emphasis on this book, American schools should especially be targets).  For some of these standards, look at [[Help:Textbook Standards]] for some specific standards that apply to many states (and other countries as well).  My experience is that this is indeed something that is covered in High School in the level that you are proposing here, particularly by including the full text of the original documents and providing annotated remarks (perfectly acceptable here on Wikibooks BTW, just unusual for Wikijunior).

== Federalist Papers and Articles of Confederation ==

The Articles of Confederation, IMHO, is as significant to the people of the USA as is the Declaration of Independence.  While it is true that it is viewed by historians as a failed document in the sense that it had no real power and had a number of flaws in its structure, it did establish guidelines for establishing a government for the United States of America, and was the legal basis for the U.S. government that existed prior to 1788.  Even if all that is done is contrasting the weakness of the Articles against the Constitution, it is useful and important in terms of putting a context to the U.S. Constitution, and why the Constitution was written in the first place.

As far as the Federalist Papers are concerned, these are citable in arguments with the U.S. Supreme Court when trying to decide constitional issues, and were remarkably insightful in terms of what the founders of the U.S.A. thought the country would eventually become.  This is a series of &quot;letters to the editor&quot; that were written by proponents of the Constition, and were instrumental in getting the Constition passed by state legislatures, notably New York and Pennsylvania.  Imagine what the USA would be like without either state, and you see the magnitude of what was accomplished with these letters.  They predicted the U.S. Civil War, and much of what was written in them has relevance today.  Most recently, with the impeachment of Bill Clinton, the Federalist Papers were called into service to help interpret the meaning of what was an impeachable offense for a sitting U.S. President.  Indeed the very procedure and process to perform the impeachment had to be developed by reading the Federalist Papers, particularly with the impeachment of Richard Nixon when such impeachments had never been previously even considered throughout most of U.S. History.

These are both significant documents in American history, and IMHO a part of the &quot;cannon&quot; of founding documents for the USA.  Certainly any book aimed towards children that omits either document fails to effectively explain what the USA is really about and is missing a significant part of American history.  If you want to claim that you understand what the U.S. government is about, these are simply must read documents as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:57, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Tokugawa Ieyasu2.JPG|thumb|Tokugawa Ieyasu]]
The Edo period (江戸時代 Edo jidai), or Tokugawa period (徳川時代 Tokugawa jidai), is a division of Japanese history which was ruled by the shoguns of the Tokugawa family, running from 1603 to 1868. The political entity of this period was the Tokugawa shogunate.
The Tokugawa shogunate was officially established in Edo on 24 March 1603 by the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Tokugawa shogunate was overthrown by the Meiji Restoration on 3 May 1868, the fall of Edo and the restoration of Tenno's rule at the reign of fifteenth and last shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu.
==Rule of shogun and daimyo==
An evolution took place in the centuries from the time of the Kamakura shogunate, which co-existed in equilibrium with the Tenno's court, to the Tokugawa, when the bushi became the unchallenged rulers in what historian Edwin O. Reischauer called a &quot;centralized feudal&quot; form of government. Instrumental in the rise of the new bakufu was Tokugawa Ieyasu, the main beneficiary of the achievements of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Already powerful, Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich Kantō area. He maintained 2.5 million koku of land, new headquarters at Edo, a strategically situated castle town (the future Tokyo), and also had an additional two million koku of land and thirty-eight vassals under his control. After Hideyoshi's death, Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the Toyotomi family.

Ieyasu's victory over the western daimyo at the Battle of Sekigahara (October 21, 1600, or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the Keichō era) gave him virtual control of all Japan. He rapidly abolished numerous enemy daimyo houses, reduced others, such as that of the Toyotomi, and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies. Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western daimyo, but his assumption of the title of shogun helped consolidate the alliance system. After further strengthening his power base, Ieyasu installed his son Hidetada (1579–1632) as shogun and himself as retired shogun in 1605. The Toyotomi were still a significant threat, and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication. In 1615, the Toyotomi stronghold at Osaka was destroyed by the Tokugawa army.

The Tokugawa (or Edo) period brought 250 years of stability to Japan. The political system evolved into what historians call bakuhan, a combination of the terms bakufu and han (domains) to describe the government and society of the period. In the bakuhan, the shogun had national authority and the daimyo had regional authority. This represented a new unity in the feudal structure, which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of centralized and decentralized authorities. The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule: land redistribution gave them nearly seven million koku, control of the most important cities, and a land assessment system reaping great revenues.
The feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of daimyo. Closest to the Tokugawa house were the shinpan, or &quot;related houses&quot;. They were twenty-three daimyo on the borders of Tokugawa lands, daimyo all directly related to Ieyasu. The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu. The second class of the hierarchy were the fudai, or &quot;house daimyo&quot;, rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service. By the eighteenth century, 145 fudai controlled such smaller han, the greatest assessed at 250,000 koku. Members of the fudai class staffed most of the major bakufu offices. Ninety-seven han formed the third group, the tozama (outside vassals), former opponents or new allies. The tozama were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million koku of productive land. Because the tozama were least trusted of the daimyo, they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated, although they were excluded from central government positions.

The Tokugawa not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan, they also had unprecedented power over the emperor, the court, all daimyo and the religious orders. The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the shogun, who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family. The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands. To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family, Ieyasu's granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619.
A code of laws was established to regulate the daimyo houses. The code encompassed private conduct, marriage, dress, types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year (the sankin kōtai system); prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships; proscribed Christianity; restricted castles to one per domain (han) and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law. Although the daimyo were not taxed per se, they were regularly levied for contributions for military and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles, roads, bridges and palaces. The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the daimyo, thus weakening their threat to the central administration. The han, once military-centered domains, became mere local administrative units. The daimyo did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers, bureaucrats and commoners. Loyalty was exacted from religious foundations, already greatly weakened by Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, through a variety of control mechanisms.
==The Begining of the Sakoku==
Like Hideyoshi, Ieyasu encouraged foreign trade but also was suspicious of outsiders. He wanted to make Edo a major port, but once he learned that the Europeans favored ports in Kyūshū and that China had rejected his plans for official trade, he moved to control existing trade and allowed only certain ports to handle specific kinds of commodities.
The beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the Nanban trade period during which intense interaction with European powers, on the economic and religious plane, took place. It is at the beginning of the Edo period that Japan built her first ocean-going Western-style warships, such as the San Juan Bautista, a 500-ton galleon-type ship that transported a Japanese embassy headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga to the Americas and then to Europe. Also during that period, the bakufu commissioned around 350 Red Seal Ships, three-masted and armed trade ships, for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as Yamada Nagamasa, used those ships throughout Asia.

The &quot;Christian problem&quot; was, in effect, a problem of controlling both the Christian daimyo in Kyūshū and their trade with the Europeans. By 1612, the shogun's retainers and residents of Tokugawa lands had been ordered to forswear Christianity. More restrictions came in 1616 (the restriction of foreign trade to Nagasaki and Hirado, an island northwest of Kyūshū), 1622 (the execution of 120 missionaries and converts), 1624 (the expulsion of the Spanish), and 1629 (the execution of thousands of Christians). Finally, the Closed Country Edict of 1635 prohibited any Japanese from traveling outside Japan or, if someone left, from ever returning. In 1636 the Dutch were restricted to Dejima, a small artificial island—and thus, not true Japanese soil—in Nagasaki's harbor.

The shogunate perceived Catholic Christianity to be an extremely destabilizing factor, leading to the persecution of Catholicism. The Shimabara Rebellion of 1637–38, in which discontented Catholic Christian samurai and peasants rebelled against the bakufu—and Edo called in Dutch ships to bombard the rebel stronghold—marked the end of the Christian movement, although some Catholic Christians survived by going underground, the so-called Kakure Kirishitan. Soon thereafter, the Portuguese were permanently expelled, members of the Portuguese diplomatic mission were executed, all subjects were ordered to register at a Buddhist or Shinto temple, and the Dutch and Chinese were restricted, respectively, to Dejima and to a special quarter in Nagasaki. Besides small trade of some outer daimyo with Korea and the Ryukyu Islands, to the southwest of Japan's main islands, by 1641, foreign contacts were limited by the policy of sakoku to Nagasaki.

By 1650, Christianity was almost completely eradicated, and external political, economic and religious influence on Japan became quite limited. Only China, the Dutch East India Company, and for a short period, the English, enjoyed the right to visit Japan during this period, for commercial purposes only, and they were restricted to the Dejima port in Nagasaki. Other Europeans who landed on Japanese shores were put to death without trial. This state of the country being closed is known as the Sakoku(鎖国).
==Society==
After a long period of inner conflict, the first goal of the newly established Tokugawa government was to pacify the country. It created a balance of power that remained (fairly) stable for the next 250 years, influenced by Confucian principles of social order. Most samurai lost their direct possession of the land: all land ownership was concentrated in the hands of the about 300 daimyo. The samurai had a choice: Give up their sword and become peasants, or move to the city of their feudal lord and become a paid retainer. Only a few land samurai remained in the border provinces of the north, or as direct vassals of the shogun, the 5,000 so-called hatamoto. The daimyo were put under tight control of the shogunate. Their families had to reside in Edo; the daimyo themselves had to reside in Edo for one year and in their province (han) for the next. This system was called sankin kōtai.
During the Tokugawa period, the social order, based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles (kuge), together with the Shogun and daimyo. Below them the population was divided into four classes in a system known as mibunsei (身分制): the samurai on top (about 5% of the population) and the peasants (more than 80% of the population) on the second level. Below the peasants were the craftsmen, and even below them, on the fourth level, were the merchants. Only the peasants lived in the rural areas. Samurai, craftsmen and merchants lived in the cities that were built around the daimyo's castles, each restricted to their own quarter.
Outside the four classes were the so-called eta and hinin, those whose professions broke the taboos of Buddhism. Eta were butchers, tanners and undertakers. Hinin served as town guards, street cleaners and executioners. Other outsiders included the beggars, entertainers, and prostitutes. The word eta literally translates to &quot;filthy&quot; and hinin to &quot;non-humans&quot;, a thorough reflection of the attitude held by other classes that the eta and hinin were not even people. Hinin were only allowed inside a special quarter of the city. The actors usually travelled in groups from one village to another, performing in each city then moving to the next. Sometimes eta villages were not even printed on official maps.
The individual had no legal rights in Tokugawa Japan. The family was the smallest legal entity, and the maintenance of family status and privileges was of great importance at all levels of society. For example, the Edo period penal laws prescribed &quot;non-free labor&quot; or slavery for the immediate family of executed criminals in Article 17 of the Gotōke reijō (Tokugawa House Laws), but the practice never became common. The 1711 Gotōke reijō was compiled from over 600 statutes promulgated between 1597 and 1696.
==Economic Development==
The Edo period bequeathed a vital commercial sector in burgeoning urban centers, a relatively well-educated elite, a sophisticated government bureaucracy, productive agriculture, a closely unified nation with highly developed financial and marketing systems, and a national infrastructure of roads.
Economic development during the Tokugawa period included urbanization, increased shipping of commodities, a significant expansion of domestic and, initially, foreign commerce, and a diffusion of trade and handicraft industries. The construction trades flourished, along with banking facilities and merchant associations. Increasingly, han authorities oversaw the rising agricultural production and the spread of rural handicrafts.

By the mid-eighteenth century, Edo had a population of more than one million, and Osaka and Kyoto each had more than 400,000 inhabitants. Many other castle towns grew as well. Japan had almost zero population growth between the 1720s and 1820s, often attributed to lower birth rates in response to widespread famine, but some historians have presented different theories, such as a high rate of infanticide artificially controlling population. Osaka and Kyoto became busy trading and handicraft production centers, while Edo was the center for the supply of food and essential urban consumer goods.
Rice was the base of the economy, as the daimyo collected the taxes from the peasants in the form of rice. Taxes were high, about 40% of the harvest. The rice was sold at the fudasashi market in Edo. To raise money, the daimyo used forward contracts to sell rice that was not even harvested yet. These contracts were similar to modern futures trading.
It was during the Edo period that Japan developed an advanced forest management policy. Increased demand for timber resources for construction, shipbuilding and fuel had led to widespread deforestation, which resulted in forest fires, floods and soil erosion. In response the shogun, beginning around 1666, instituted a policy to reduce logging and increase the planting of trees. The policy mandated that only the shogun and daimyo could authorize the use of wood. By the 18th century, Japan had developed detailed scientific knowledge about silviculture and plantation forestry.
==Artistic and intellectual development==
During the period, Japan progressively studied Western sciences and techniques (called rangaku, literally &quot;Dutch studies&quot;) through the information and books received through the Dutch traders in Dejima. The main areas that were studied included geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, art, languages, physical sciences such as the study of electrical phenomena, and mechanical sciences as exemplified by the development of Japanese clockwatches, or wadokei, inspired by Western techniques.
The flourishing of Neo-Confucianism was the major intellectual development of the Tokugawa period. Confucian studies had long been kept active in Japan by Buddhist clerics, but during the Tokugawa period, Confucianism emerged from Buddhist religious control. This system of thought increased attention to a secular view of man and society. The ethical humanism, rationalism, and historical perspective of neo-Confucian doctrine appealed to the official class. By the mid-seventeenth century, neo-Confucianism was Japan's dominant legal philosophy and contributed directly to the development of the kokugaku (national learning) school of thought.

Advanced studies and growing applications of neo-Confucianism contributed to the transition of the social and political order from feudal norms to class- and large-group-oriented practices. The rule of the people or Confucian man was gradually replaced by the rule of law. New laws were developed, and new administrative devices were instituted. A new theory of government and a new vision of society emerged as a means of justifying more comprehensive governance by the bakufu. Each person had a distinct place in society and was expected to work to fulfill his or her mission in life. The people were to be ruled with benevolence by those whose assigned duty it was to rule. Government was all-powerful but responsible and humane. Although the class system was influenced by neo-Confucianism, it was not identical to it. Whereas soldiers and clergy were at the bottom of the hierarchy in the Chinese model, in Japan, some members of these classes constituted the ruling elite.
Members of the samurai class adhered to bushi traditions with a renewed interest in Japanese history and in cultivation of the ways of Confucian scholar-administrators, resulting in the development of the concept of bushido (the way of the warrior). Another special way of life—chōnindō—also emerged. Chōnindō (the way of the townspeople) was a distinct culture that arose in cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, and Edo. It encouraged aspiration to bushido qualities—diligence, honesty, honor, loyalty, and frugality—while blending Shinto, neo-Confucian, and Buddhist beliefs. Study of mathematics, astronomy, cartography, engineering, and medicine were also encouraged. Emphasis was placed on quality of workmanship, especially in the arts.
For the first time, urban populations had the means and leisure time to support a new mass culture. Their search for enjoyment became known as ukiyo (the floating world), an ideal world of fashion, popular entertainment, and the discovery of aesthetic qualities in objects and actions of everyday life, including sex (shunga). This increasing interest in pursuing recreational activities helped to develop an array of new industries, many of which could be found in an area known as Yoshiwara. The region was better known for being the center of Edo’s developing sense of elegance and refinement. This place of pleasure and luxury became a destination for the elite and wealthy merchants who wished to flaunt their fortune. Their economy relied primarily on the patronage of such individuals in order to sustain itself. For many of those who inhabited and worked in this region maintaining the illusion of grandeur was the only way of supporting their business.

Yoshiwara was home to mostly women who, due to unfortunate circumstances, found themselves working in this secluded environment. Combining factors such as rent, value of their employment contract, cost of clothing, make-up, gift giving and other expenses, this ensured that many would spend their entire lives working to pay off their debts . These females were expected to perform dances, sing, play an instrument, gossip or provide companionship in order that their guests would come again. As a result, the region developed its own culture which, in turn, determined what would be popular in the rest of the country. This was particularly true for fashion because a woman’s identity was determined by her clothing, specifically it clarified what her profession and status was within that field. The quality of her attire ensured that she stood out from the rest of her competition. It was her only means of establishing a reputation and helped to market her talents. However, Yoshiwara also possessed a seedier side. Much of the business conducted here incorporated the use of prostitution as a means to deal with the women’s cost of living. As a result, since its establishment was first authorised by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1589, this area became the country’s government sanctioned red-light district. This designation lasted for approximately 250 years.
Professional female entertainers (geisha), music, popular stories, Kabuki and bunraku (puppet theater), poetry, a rich literature, and art, exemplified by beautiful woodblock prints (known as ukiyo-e), were all part of this flowering of culture. Literature also flourished with the talented examples of the playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653–1724) and the poet, essayist, and travel writer Matsuo Bashō (1644–94).

Ukiyo-e prints began to be produced in the late 17th century, but in 1764 Harunobu produced the first polychrome print. Print designers of the next generation, including Torii Kiyonaga and Utamaro, created elegant and sometimes insightful depictions of courtesans. In the 19th century, the dominant figure was Hiroshige, a creator of romantic and somewhat sentimental landscape prints. The odd angles and shapes through which Hiroshige often viewed landscape and the work of Kiyonaga and Utamaro, with its emphasis on flat planes and strong linear outlines, later had a profound impact on such Western artists as Edgar Degas and Vincent van Gogh.
Buddhism and Shinto were both still important in Tokugawa Japan. Buddhism, combined with neo-Confucianism, provided standards of social behavior. Although not as powerful politically as it had been in the past, Buddhism was espoused by the upper classes. Proscriptions against Christianity benefited Buddhism in 1640 when the bakufu ordered everyone to register at a temple. The rigid separation of Tokugawa society into han, villages, wards, and households helped reaffirm local Shinto attachments. Shinto provided spiritual support to the political order and was an important tie between the individual and the community. Shinto also helped preserve a sense of national identity.
Shinto eventually assumed an intellectual form as shaped by neo-Confucian rationalism and materialism. The kokugaku movement emerged from the interactions of these two belief systems. Kokugaku contributed to the emperor-centered nationalism of modern Japan and the revival of Shinto as a national creed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The Kojiki, Nihon Shoki, and Man'yōshū were all studied anew in the search for the Japanese spirit. Some purists in the kokugaku movement, such as Motoori Norinaga, even criticized the Confucian and Buddhist influences—in effect, foreign influences—for contaminating Japan's ancient ways. Japan was the land of the kami and, as such, had a special destiny.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Meiji Restoration (明治維新 Meiji Ishin) is the collective name for the events that restored imperial rule to Japan in 1868. The Restoration led to enormous changes in Japan's political and social structure, and spanned both the late Edo period (often called Late Tokugawa shogunate) and the beginning of the Meiji Era, as the country was opened to the rest of the world.

[[Image:MeijiJoukyou.jpg|thumb|The 16-year old Meiji Emperor, moving from Kyoto to Tokyo, after the fall of Edo.]]
==Alliances and allegiances==
The formation in 1866 of the Satsuma-Chōshū Alliance between Saigō Takamori, the leader of the Satsuma domain, and Kido Takayoshi, the leader of the Chōshū domain, built the foundation of the Meiji restoration. These two leaders supported the Emperor Kōmei (Emperor Meiji's father) and were brought together by Sakamoto Ryoma for the purpose of challenging the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate (bakufu) and restoring the emperor to power. On February 3, 1867, Emperor Meiji ascended the throne after Emperor Kōmei's death on January 30, 1867. This period also saw Japan change from being a feudal society to having a capitalist economy and left the Japanese with a lingering Western influence.

==Bakumatsu==
During the last years of the bakufu, or bakumatsu, the bakufu took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of anti-Western sentiment throughout the country.

The army and the navy were modernized. A naval training school was established in Nagasaki in 1855. Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral Enomoto. French naval engineers were hired to build naval arsenals, such as Yokosuka and Nagasaki. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1867, the Japanese navy of the shogun already possessed eight Western-style steam warships around the flagship Kaiyō Maru, which were used against pro-imperial forces during the Boshin war under the command of Admiral Enomoto. A French military mission was established to help modernize the armies of the bakufu.

Revering the emperor as a symbol of unity, extremists wrought violence and death against the Bakufu and Han authorities and foreigners. Foreign naval retaliation in the Anglo-Satsuma War led to still another concessionary commercial treaty in 1865, but Yoshitomi was unable to enforce the Western treaties. A bakufu army was defeated when it was sent to crush dissent in the Satsuma and Chōshū Domains in 1866. Finally, in 1867, Emperor Kōmei died and was succeeded by his minor son Emperor Meiji.

Tokugawa Yoshinobu reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and shogun. He tried to reorganize the government under the emperor while preserving the shogun's leadership role. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Chōshū daimyo, other daimyo called for returning the shogun's political power to the emperor and a council of daimyo chaired by the former Tokugawa shogun. Yoshinobu accepted the plan in late 1867 and resigned, announcing an &quot;imperial restoration&quot;. The Satsuma, Chōshū, and other han leaders and radical courtiers, however, rebelled, seized the imperial palace, and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868.

Shortly thereafter in January 1868, the Boshin War (War of the Year of the Dragon) started with the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in which Chōshū and Satsuma's forces defeated the ex-shogun's army. This forced (or allowed) Emperor Meiji to strip Yoshinobu of all power, setting the stage for official restoration. On January 3, 1868, the Emperor made a formal declaration of the restoration of his power:
&quot;The Emperor of Japan announces to the sovereigns of all foreign countries and to their subjects that permission has been granted to the Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu to return the governing power in accordance with his own request. We shall henceforward exercise supreme authority in all the internal and external affairs of the country. Consequently the title of Emperor must be substituted for that of Taikun, in which the treaties have been made. Officers are being appointed by us to the conduct of foreign affairs. It is desirable that the representatives of the treaty powers recognize this announcement.&quot;

There were many causes to the Meiji Restoration. The Japanese knew that they were behind the rest of the world when American Commodore Matthew C. Perry came to Japan to try and issue a treaty that would open up Japanese ports to trade. Perry came to Japan in large warships that far outdated any Japanese ship at the time. The leaders of the Meiji Restoration, as this revolution came to be known, acted in the name of restoring imperial rule. The word &quot;Meiji&quot; means &quot;enlightened rule&quot; and the goal was to combine &quot;western advancements&quot; with the traditional, &quot;eastern&quot; values. The main leaders of this were: Ito Hirobumi, Matsukata Masayoshi, Kido Takayoshi, Itagaki Taisuke, Yamagata Aritomo, Mori Arinori, Okubo Toshimichi, and Yamaguchi Naoyoshi. However, political power simply moved from the Tokugawa Shogun to an oligarchy consisting of these leaders, mostly from the Satsuma Province (Okubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori), and the Chōshū province (Ito Hirobumi, Yamagata Aritomo, and Kido Takayoshi). This reflected their belief in the more traditional practice of imperial rule, whereby the emperor performs his high priestly duties and his ministers govern the nation in his name.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The rise of the Internet, the creation of a global fiber-optic network, and the rapid development of long distance communication technologies has made it very easy for people all over the world to work together. It created a global platform that has allowed more people to plug and play, collaborate and compete, share knowledge and share work, than anything we have ever seen in the history of the world (Friedman, 2005). The new communication technology gives teams a great advantage by providing many options that didn’t exist before, such as allowing employees to work from their homes locally or by working together in teams across the continents. 

The nature of work has begun to shift from a production-based to service related business spawning a new generation of knowledge worker no longer bound to a physical work location. Taken together, these factors suggest that firms are faced with increasing challenges to coordinate tasks across time zones, physical boundaries, cultures, and organizational contexts. The increasing globalization of trade and corporate activity increases the pressure to innovate and provide quality services to worldwide markets. Over time, this has led organizations to choose the most qualified people, a “dream-team,” regardless of their physical location (Kerber, 2004:4). These remotely connected dream teams are known as global virtual teams (GVTs).

Global virtual teams are different from intra-national virtual teams in that they are “not only separated by time and space, but differ in national, cultural, and linguistic attributes (Zakaria, 2004:17).” According to Wheatley and Wilemon (1999), global team members “differ in their functionality, which adds complexity to group dynamics.” Global virtual teams can be formed quickly and are agile by their nature. They can help organizations decrease their response time to changes in today’s hyper-competitive markets by taking advantage of round the clock work by team members dispersed around the world.

A global virtual team possesses some similarities to traditional teams who are co-located. The same fundamental ideas, as stated in Chapter 6.1 of this Wikibook, that are necessary for the success of a traditional team still apply to global virtual team. The approach however, requires modification to focus extra effort to exploit the benefits that global virtual teams bring while minimizing the disadvantages that exist from communication difficulties and a lack of physical contact. This paper investigates the benefits, challenges, and best practices of managing global virtual teams while keeping in mind the fact that global virtual teams are still teams requiring the same ideals to ensure success.

== Building Virtual Teams ==
[[Image:blocks.jpg]]

'''Introduction'''

Because of the unique challenges confronting virtual teams, it is especially important at their formation that they build upon a strong foundation. Some of the ideas in this chapter are expanded and explored in the following chapter. Among others, building blocks for successful virtual teams include the following:

*Creating a mission, goals, and ground rules
*Identifying stakeholders and their expectations
*Complimentary roles and responsibilities
*Building relationships, trust, and rewarding experiences

'''Creating a mission, goals, and ground rules'''

An often overlooked exercise in any team situation is the discussion of processes and rules which should govern team meetings and projects. Virtual teams are no exception. In reality, establishing and adhering to goals and ground rules is more complicated in virtual teams than in those where members have the frequent opportunity to meet face-to-face. The inability to have face time with one another makes it difficult for team members to &quot;touch base&quot; and maintain a unified purpose. The need to do this, however, is clear. If the individuals of a team do not have a clear and shared understanding of where they are going, they will never get there. Virtual teams should hold an orientation meeting (face-to-face if possible) where team members acknowledge not only the purpose of the team, but the significance of their team's purpose for the organization in which it operates. Understanding their purpose, members of the team should then set goals and assign tasks toward the fulfilling of that purpose. Each team member should come away from the orientation meeting with a clear understanding of the team's purpose as well as their individual role. 

'''Identifying stakeholders and their expectations'''

The purpose of a virtual team should be very closely tied to the expectations of stakeholders. Therefore, stakeholders or stakeholder representatives should be actively involved in the formation of the virtual team. Clarifying the needs and expectations of stakeholders in the beginning will help the team to avoid unnecessary work, confusion, and conflict. A documentation of stakeholder's expectations should be made for reference throughout the project. Future communication between stakeholders and team representatives will further ensure that the team's purpose is on track and being fulfilled.

'''Complimentary roles and responsibilities''' 

It is important that every member of a virtual team has a full understanding of the capabilities and roles of individual team members. Each must know his or her role, the role of others, and to who they may look for resources and support. Without this knowledge, the team will not achieve its performance potential. If the responsibilities of team members are clearly defined and documented, each team member will be accountable to each other and to the group for the fulfilling of their responsibilities. The ground rules established in the formation of the group should address responsibilities and tasks and likewise identify remedies and protocol when individual and group responsibilities are not fulfilled. In order for team members to &quot;own&quot; their role and responsibilities, they should document their perceptions of their role within the team. Only when team members have fully bought into the team's purpose and their role within it can they be held fully accountable. 

Naturally, it is important that the roles and responsibilities of team members compliment one another and represent a unique and useful asset to the team. Selecting individuals to take part in a virtual team requires thoughtful consideration. Depending on the size of the team and scope of its purpose, teams may include a core group which is fully accountable for the results, as well as extended or ancillary members who bring unique knowledge to the team. Flexibility and adaptability are necessary in new virtual teams as their purpose and needs evolve.

'''Building relationships, trust, and rewarding experiences'''

The ideal way of building relationships with team members is to spend time together face-to-face. As mentioned earlier, this can be difficult in virtual teams whose members may reside continents away. LaFasto and Larson suggest that it is even more important for virtual teams to connect in person on a regular basis: &quot;For a group of regional managers spread across the country or around the world, ensuring adequate face time might mean meeting together every quarter to calibrate major activities, explore common challenges, and ''confirm relationships&quot;'' (181).

When relationships between team members are built and confirmed on an ongoing basis, a culture of trust will exist even when members are working virtually with one another. The way a group behaves and performs affects individual members. When trust is present and group behavior is positive, so too will be team member's evaluation of the experience. An individual's positive evaluation of the team leads to greater trust and ongoing participation. The collaborative participation of team's members translates into group behavior in a cyclical pattern as shown below.

[[Image:Group behaviour.svg]]

'''Opportunities'''

There are many benefits of using global virtual teams due to the increased number of options and resources they provide. Jarvenpaa and Leidner explain that &quot;Virtual teams promise the flexibility, responsiveness, lower costs, and improved resource utilization necessary to meet ever-changing task requirements in highly turbulent and dynamic global business environments (1999:791).&quot; Moreover, the use of global virtual teams provides an opportunity to coordinate complex business tasks across a potentially far-flung confederation of organizations. This allows companies to better communicate and coordinate even though vast distances separate the different team members, making it easier to expand internationally and removing other location and distance-based restrictions.

; Flexibility : The required expertise for a given task or project can be dispersed by multiple locations throughout the world. However, a global virtual team may facilitate the pooling of this talent to provide focused attention to a particular problem without having to physically relocate individuals. “Virtual teams allow organizations to bring together critical contributors who might not otherwise be able to work together due to time, travel, and cost restrictions (Kerber, 2004: 4).” This allows workers to be located anywhere and allows companies the opportunity to work virtually with team members in geographic areas that were previously considered too distant to be considered a viable work location

; Responsiveness : Companies can be more responsive to their customers through diversity.  “Virtual teams may allow organizations to unify the varying perspectives of different cultures and business customs to avoid counterproductive ethno-centric biases (Kayworth, 2000:184).”  Global virtual teams composed of members with different cultural visions may be less likely to experience “groupthink” and are more likely to develop innovative solutions to problems.  In addition, the ability to respond to the specific and varied needs of a global audience can be addressed quickly and effectively with a global virtual team.  Members of a global virtual team can immediately respond to specific geographic and cultural requirements previously ignored or missed by collocated teams.

; Lower costs : Global virtual teams can help corporations lower their labor and overhead costs. There are pools of inexpensive, highly skilled labor forces in various locations around the world who can’t or do not want to be relocated. Access by communication to these labor forces leads many organizations to offshore certain functions traditionally performed in-house or by contractors. This is an appealing option to many organizations looking to reduce overall project and maintenance costs. By outsourcing the development of an application to India, for example, an organization can reduce the cost of a project. This is because India, in addition to many other countries, has a large population of highly educated people who can be accessed with today’s advanced communications technology. This allows the company to pay someone in India much less to do the same work compared to someone working locally in the U.S. Global virtual teams also reduce travel, accommodations, and other miscellaneous expenses for team members.

; Improved resource utilization : Global virtual teams can improve resource utilization by leveraging time to their advantage. Performing work asynchronously helps global organizations effectively bridge different time zones so that teams can be more productive during a work period. “For example, London team members of a global virtual team of software developers at Tandem Services Corporation initially coded the project and transmitted their code each evening to U.S. team members for testing. U.S. members forwarded the code they tested to Tokyo for debugging. London team members started their next day with the code debugged by their Japanese colleagues, and another cycle was initiated. This is only one example of how GVTs can increase team-member productivity and reduce development time (Saunders, 2004:19).”

'''Pitfalls'''

The pitfalls that virtual teams face in their early stages stem simply from the antitheses of the building blocks described above. As with water, teams tend to follow the &quot;path of least resistance.&quot; This is because the pitfalls of virtual team building are due to omissions and inactivity. A common pitfall is setting out without a clear goal or purpose. If team members understand little more than the routine tasks they are to perform day-to-day, a lack of common understanding will lead to misdirected work and wasted time and resources. A related pitfall is misaligning the purpose of the team with the needs and expectations of stakeholders and the organization as a whole. Virtual teams further damage themselves when they neglect to take opportunities for building strong communication and trust in their relationships. 

'''Solutions'''

*Hold an orientation meeting where team members participate in team building activities and document the team's purpose. Each team member should document his or her understanding of the team's purpose and their perceived role. These descriptions should be circulated within the group.
*Prepare a questionnaire for each stakeholder to complete and return to the group. The questions should illicit a response which helps the team in the formation of goals and confirmation of the team's purpose.
*Whenever possible, team members should meet face-to-face to confirm relationships and participate in activities which build trust and encourage communication.

== Culture ==
{{expand}}
; Introduction : Cultural differences add value and diversity to teams, but can cause problems as well.  The two main cultural issues that appear in global virtual teams are: false perception of similarity and differing perceptions of teamwork.

*Diversity: It has been proven through many studies of successful teams that diversity can reduce the occurrence of &quot;groupthink&quot; and allow a team to make better and more creative decisions.  Team members from different cultures automatically bring diversity to the group.  This diversity should not be ignored or minimized; rather it should be embraced and utilized.  Effective ideas from one country or market can be adapted successfully for others.      

; Pitfalls :
*False perception of similarity: There is often a false assumption among immigrants from English-speaking countries that they will have an easier time assimilating than those coming from non-English speaking countries. In actuality, foreign nationals from English-speaking countries experience higher rates of culture shock than those from non-English-speaking countries. This is due to a perception that the cultures will be similar because there is a shared language. This perception also plagues global virtual teams. “Welch, and Marschan-Piekkari (2001:197) and Usunier (1993) show that because of perceived familiarity and similarity across English-speaking countries, individuals can be lured into a false sense of confidence and fail to perceive that they are not culturally close. This can have a negative impact on business communication processes and personal relationships (Henderson, 2005:75).” 

*Differing perceptions of teamwork: The concept of teamwork varies between cultures. “Members from different cultures will, in all probability, describe a team’s objectives, membership criteria, and activities in very different terms (Zakaria, 2004:20).”  The value of individual work as opposed to teamwork differs greatly between countries. Individuals born and raised in Great Britain, Canada (excluding Quebec), and the United States tend to be more individualistic. Chinese and Indian individuals, on the other hand, are more focused on collective efforts. As Jarvenpaa &amp; Leidner (1999:793) explain, &quot;Individuals from individualistic cultures tend to be less concerned with self-categorizing, are less influenced by group membership, have greater skills in entering and leaving new groups, and engage in more open and precise communication than individuals from collectivist cultures.&quot; Additionally, “individuals from individualistic cultures might be more ready to trust others than individuals from collectivist cultures in computer-mediated communication environments (Jarvenpaa, 1999:794).” These differences make it difficult to determine what the cause of a problem may be with team members because it’s difficult to distinguish between cultural and personal factors. This makes diagnosing and solving problems more difficult than in traditional teams.

; Solutions : 
*A good way to approach cultural differences is to learn as much as possible about the culture. This includes background research or meeting with consultants to learn how best to behave before the initial meeting. Any attention spent in this area will go a long way toward team success. Being prepared and making a good first impression will send positive signals to members of the other culture and will signify intentions of commitment. Knowing that Aussie’s can be very direct in their communication will assist an American in not taking it personally when being told to “mind your own business (Sabath, 1999:24).”  It is also helpful to know that is it not uncommon for Japanese to “wait 10 to 15 seconds before responding” to a question or comment (Sabath, 1999: 93).  This type of cultural information will reduce tension among team members.

== Trust ==

; Introduction : Trust in global virtual teams is both important and difficult to build because team members are limited in their physical interaction. In addition to the lack of social context, language barriers and a reliance on stereotypes complicate the building of trust in global virtual team.

; Opportunities : In other cultures, relationships and trust are paramount in business.  If virtual team members from the United States manage to gain the trust of foreign associates, that trust could very well translate into a lifetime of profitable business interactions.   

; Pitfalls :
*Language: A major challenge for teams composed of speakers of different languages is that the building of trust and relationships is largely language dependent. Based on published research and illustrative empirical data, findings indicate that language diversity has a significant impact on socialization processes and team building, influencing both communication acts and mutual perceptions. Results of investigations into multilingual teams using English to communicate have shown that many obstacles are encountered by native as well as nonnative speakers (Henderson, 2005:79). “Research has shown that language-related issues can impact negatively on interpersonal relations, trust, and the working atmosphere (Henderson, 2005:67).”

*Reliance on stereotypes: One of the difficulties international teams experience is the tendency to resort to national stereotypes that can lead to misinterpretations of the behavior of team members, leading to tensions and mistrust. “These are expressed in the form of judgments of others who may be labeled as being, for example, ‘reserved,’ ‘silent,’ or ‘direct,’ based on the stereotypical linguistic attributes of the language community to which they belong (Henderson, 2005:74).”  It is important to address these hurdles to building trust in global virtual teams because “the inability to develop these relationships within a social context may negatively impact such outcomes as creativity, morale, decision-making quality, and process loss (Kayworth, 2000:189).”

; Solutions :
*One way to promote trust is to have smaller groupings and make their tenure together a longer period of time. This permits the team members to know each other better in comparison to a system in which the teams are constantly shifting. If the team members know that they’ll be around each other for a long time into the future, they will have an incentive to put more effort into building lasting relationships. The prospect of spending more time together in the future discourages negative behavior, such as not returning an email, because sometime in the future this will have negative consequences. In a rapidly shifting team, however, building relationships is not as important because the team won’t be together for much longer. If the team members know they’ll be working together for a long time they’ll have an incentive to work together and trust each other much more than they otherwise would. Having the same team together for a long time opens the possibility that the team will become outdated and obsolete. Therefore the team must be flexible, innovative, explore new technologies, and be capable of learning so that the team continues to be effective during their long tenure together.

*Stereotype Breakdown: Another way to build trust in global virtual teams is to breakdown these stereotypes and allow people to realize that we are all humans with similar problems, despite the vast cultural differences.  Majchrzak (2004, 7) tells of a successful example of this form of trust building: The leader of one team, a retired military officer, started his conference calls by asking each person to spend 30 seconds describing “where the member is at.” During a conference call in 2002, when snipers were terrorizing the Washington, DC, area, a team member living there said she didn’t feel so alone after she heard her fears echoed by another member in the Philippines, where insurgents were shooting people on their way to and from work. By using this simple technique, team leaders can assist their team members in realizing they share many similar experiences as do their co-workers on the other side of the world.  This will create closeness and facilitate the building of trust.  

*Structure: Management must also pay strong attention to facilitate the proper balance between the level of structure and trust developed among team members. A strong structure, which translates into clear and shared goals, norms, task and process descriptions, hierarchy, roles, personal interaction and relationship, reduces the ambiguity that typically exists in global virtual teams (Jarvenpaa, 2004:251). Working on a global virtual team makes it more difficult to specifically identify exactly what you should be working on because of its solitary nature. This increases the need for specifying the process because of the lack of social interaction which would normally allow someone to double check their work and direction with other team members. 

*Social Interaction: A kick-off meeting is a good way to promote the social interaction and relationship building necessary in teams. The team’s tasks involve highly complex messages as well as high levels of reciprocity and interdependency, which require a rich communication media and long team duration (Maznevsky, 2000:488). It is therefore recommended that whenever this context of reciprocity and interdependency is present, kick-off meetings should be held face-to-face and with plenty of opportunities for social interaction and relationship building (Anawati, 2006:50) . If a face-to-face kickoff meeting is not feasible, the team can always replicate one virtually. The initial meeting or communication is a critical time because that’s when first impressions are set and when the tone and cadence of the team’s work is determined. If the initial meeting is sloppy and unorganized, it is expected that the team’s success will be a reflection of this. However, if the initial virtual meeting is well organized, structured, and conveys a clear goal, the probability of team success will be higher.

*Specified Normative Behaviors: Structure can be added to teams by formalizing normative behaviors. Because global virtual teams lack the social interaction which would normally determine the normative behaviors in the group, normative behaviors should be specified. The management of the team should also pay additional attention to the clarity and direction of the team. This is a consequence to the lack of communication and interaction that normally exists in collocated teams. A clear and defining goal will help to align the team member’s efforts so that everyone is working in the same direction.

*Work Postings: Another way to make sure all members of the global virtual team are working in the right direction is to post the work virtually so that all the members can see what everyone else is doing.  While they made regular use of conference calls, team members did not report on the status of assignments during them. Instead, most (83%) relied on virtual work spaces. Here they posted their work in progress electronically and examined their colleagues’ postings, well in advance of teleconferences. They tended to use the conference calls themselves to discuss disagreements, which they said were more effectively handled in conversation than in writing (Majchrazak, 2004: 5.  This method of posting work makes the conference calls and other group communication more effective and less frequent because the team members can see each other's work and progress at anytime. Posting the work helped align the team members’ goals and helped them work effectively and reduced the amount of voice communication that would otherwise have been necessary. 

Finally, trust evolves with time. It starts mostly based on one’s trustworthiness while there is little knowledge and a weak structure. It then evolves to some combined balance of trust and structure as members acquire more knowledge of each other, the team’s goals, norms, etc. Along this continuum, trust faces a transition point where simple trustworthiness gives way to early stages of trust.

== Communication Techniques==

;Introduction

New virtual communication techniques are being developed all the time as teams seek for ways to improve information sharing.  Virtual Communication is achieved through two main methods: Videoconferencing Systems and Collaborative Software Systems.  

;Videoconferencing Systems

Videoconferencing is a type of visual collaboration that allows groups or individuals from two or more locations to interact through interactive audio and visual transmissions.  Microphones, speakers, cameras and video display are needed along with a system to transfer the data such as the internet or a Local Area Network (LAN).  

;Opportunities &amp; Pitfalls

*This is a powerful tool for communicating as few of the facial cues, body language indications or voice intonations and modulations from normal face to face communication are lost as in other technological communication.  Teams from distinct locations can come to know one another and develop relationships much more quickly than could be accomplished through more impersonal methods.  
*Developing teams becomes easier when the choice of personnel is not restricted by geographic considerations.  Videoconferencing and other virtual communication methods allow teams to choose the most appropriate members regardless of where they are located without the cost of travel to bring teams together.  

However there are some challenges inherent in this technique.  

*It can be difficult to schedule meetings with people or teams spread across broad geographic areas.  For a team in Australia to communicate with a team in Mountain Standard Time Zone in the U.S., they may find that their usual office hours only overlap when one company is preparing to leave and the other is just arriving.  What is more, the greater the number of members of a team, the more difficult it will be to find a time to meet that fits into everyone’s schedule.
*Another problem that arises is a lack of eye contact.  The speakers are talking to a camera and/or faces on a screen.  In some ways this is worse than a phone conversation as the technique can provide an incorrect impression of the speaker’s intentions in regards to eye contact.  
*Moreover the camera can cause people to behave unnaturally.  Stage fright or self-consciousness at appearing before a camera can influence people’s mannerisms, body language and ability to communicate effectively.  

;Solutions

*Scheduling and planning ahead are essential.  It becomes more difficult to schedule videoconferencing meetings the greater the number of people involved.  Unless the scheduling is done far in advance, meetings will often interfere with other duties and responsibilities of those involved.  
*Eye contact is important in regular conversation.  Team members using videoconferencing should be alerted to the fact that eye contact is difficult when participating in videoconferencing.  Different rules apply to this type of communication in that eye contact is often difficult over networks.[1]  
*It is important that team members behave naturally on camera.  Many people will feel uncomfortable when put before video equipment.  Increased exposure will often cure them of these difficulties.  The first time in front of videoconferencing equipment can be unnerving but with time, people often feel less conscious of their appearance and how they will be perceived.

1Vertegaal, &quot;Explaining Effects of Eye Gaze on Mediated Group Conversations: Amount or Synchronization?&quot; ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 2002

;Collaborative Software

*Collaborative software is used to allow people to work together towards a common goal without having to meet face to face.  The most common techniques are text, email, virtual chatting, calendaring, file sharing, faxes, voice mail, data conferencing, etc.  

;Opportunities

*Collaborative software is powerful because people can work together regardless of how the schedules may differ.  A team with members in different time zones is able to collaborate at different hours regardless of the lack of overlapping time spent in the office so scheduling does not have to be done so far in advance.  These techniques are also easy to implement.  The equipment can be inexpensive and easy to acquire for all members of the team.  

*One powerful aspect of collaborative software is Metcalfe’s Law.  Wikipedia describes the law as “the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users of the system (n2).”  This means that the greater the number of users, the more valuable a system becomes.  This was first used to describe the value of fax machines.  One is not that useful, but when everybody has one, they become very effective methods of communication.  Collaborative software is often similar.  One email account is not that effective, but when each person on the team has an email address, we can communicate with the team very quickly and easily.

;Pitfalls

Communication can be tricky with collaborative software.  

*Much of the body language and nonverbal communication of regular communication is lost with this technique.  Emails that are meant to be funny or sarcastic can be interpreted as just mean or angry.  
*Although scheduling can be easier, it can also be hard to manage.  Team members do not need to be together all at the same time, which is nice but, people often forget deadlines when they are not planning for a meeting or seeing each other face to face.  
*A lack of cohesion often results from this technique.  More than one person working on a document that is shared on a network or over email often results in a disjointed style or conflicting topics.  This is often the case when a team is working together on a specific project that will be presented to a certain audience.  For example a team may be preparing a report that will be presented to management.  If they are not careful the report may hold conflicting ideas or not flow in an intelligible manner.  

;Solutions

*Team members should be trained on the possible misinterpretations in this type of communication.  It is often beneficial to have more than one person review emails that will be sent to a large audience to understand how they may be received.  If people are made aware of these possibilities, they will be less likely to commit these errors or to misinterpret what they receive.
*Team members need to be managed effectively.  Deadlines should be enforced with regards to email communications.  It may be necessary to impose deadlines on how long people should take to respond to an email or make updates to a shared file.  
*Efforts should be made to analyze the project as a whole.  Groups and teams should have designated leaders that ensure unity of purpose and a cohesive finished product.

== Communication ==

'''Introduction'''

Cultural differences among team members may lead to various instances of miscommunication since different cultures tend to contain certain biases, assumptions, or views of the world. “Regardless of the source, the fact remains that the ‘cultural factor’ may lead to information distortion and various instances of miscommunication (Kayworth, 2000:191).” “Communication among global virtual teams may be extremely difficult to manage and less effective than more traditional settings (Kayworth, 2000: 184).”  “These communication problems may also be magnified by disparity among technology infrastructures, as well as differences in technology proficiency among team members. Finally, when cultural differences are added to this mix of potential issues, the management of global virtual teams may become exceedingly complex (Kayworth, 2000: 184).”

'''Selecting a Communication Medium'''

Global virtual teams are dependent on their ability to communicate with each other rapidly, reliably, and over long distances. If the team can’t communicate with each other effectively, they can’t work together effectively. This makes the reliability of the technology very important so that the flow of work can continue without interruptions. The media chosen should also be carefully selected so that the end users, or those who are using the information, as compared to those who are giving the information, are able to communicate effectively.

'''Opportunities'''

''Establishing a pattern'' Focusing on and following a strong repeating pattern of communication will set a virtual team up for success. This pattern is determined by the frequency of meetings held through the richest available media, repeating itself as a “heartbeat, rhythmically pumping new life into the group’s processes (Maznevski, 2000:486).” The group may try to establish the frequency of these “rich meetings” according to the interdependence required by the tasks and their level of group relationship (Maznevski, 2000:488). However in global virtual teams it’s important to remember that logistics commonly limit the frequency of these meetings, especially face-to-face meetings. In this case it’s the frequency of the meetings that determines the frequency of the high interdependent and complex decision processes they address, such as generating commitment, building relationships, creating social interaction and comprehensive decision making. (Maznevsky, 2000:483-484). 

'''Pitfalls'''

''Misrepresentation'' “As team members communicate, they tend to filter information through their cultural ‘lenses’, thereby giving rise to a potentially broad range of misinterpretations or distortions (Kayworth, 2000:184).” Communication styles differ wildly among various cultures. Even if someone from another country speaks English, this is not going to be the same English as that spoken elsewhere. This makes non-verbal communication, such as pauses, silence, and expressions which differ between cultures more important in global virtual teams and should be known and understood by other team members.

'''Solutions'''

* Speak slowly and clearly, use a higher tone of voice, avoid slang and colloquialisms, keep words and sentences short and confirm understanding through repetition and by asking questions.
* Avoid using slang and jargons, use simple short words and sentences and maintain focus.
* Use visual aids and send pre-meeting information to enhance participation in meetings.
* Understand and be aware of cultural differences in praise and criticism.
* Avoid humor, irony, and metaphors as these usually don’t translate well and may be offensive.
* Understand that silence, referred to as the most concerning behavior, may not reflect a lack  of interest but may simply represent time needed to think or just wait for a formal invitation to participate. 
* Respect for religious beliefs and allowance for differences in time zones were the most easily changed behaviors.

== &quot;Netiquette&quot;: Utilizing Virtual Communication Technologies Responsibly and Respectfully ==

; Introduction :
Virtual communication technologies constitute some of the most essential tools employed by members of virtual teams.  Indeed, effective communication in a virtual team setting can impact every functional component of the team and can largely determine the success or failure of the team.  Managing virtual teams requires the establishment of communication ground-rules and expectations.  As in any organization, an environment that fosters mutual respect, creativity, positive interpersonal relations, and teamwork, depends largely upon both the quality of information shared among team members, and the efficacy of communication between team members.  

Oftentimes, a failure to communicate respectfully and responsibly can hamper the efficacy and functionality of the virtual team.  Setting forth network etiquette (or 'netiquette') guidelines is an important component to effective virtual team management.  By establishing and implementing netiquette standards, the efficacy and stability of the virtual team will be more easily managed and maintained.  Virtual teams represent unlimited global business, learning and networking opportunities.  The adherence to netiquette standards will help to maintain and ensure decorum, professionalism, courtesy, and ethical behavior.    

By implementing and applying netiquette standards to the virtual team environment, team members will be better equipped to avoid informational nuances and insinuations that are so easily misinterpreted.  The &quot;communication gap&quot; that is so prevalent in virtual communication technologies (i.e. absence of body language, voice and tonal qualities, emotion, and personal interplay) may also be lessened.  Common barriers to virtual communication may also be identified and overcome through the use of clearly established netiquette standards.  

Referring to the need for increased knowledge, familiarity, and implementation of &quot;netiquette, David Krane, Director of Corporate Communications at Google, Inc., once said, &quot;We live in an era where hundreds and millions of professionals are putting down the pen and increasingly relying on e-mail as a primary form of communication. [Proper mastery of netiquette will benefit] both internet newbies and new entrants to the [virtual] workplace who may be making a transition from paper to computer or from instant messaging and e-mail between friends to more formal electronic communications.&quot;

; Netiquette Standards:
*&lt;u&gt;Respecting the E-mail Addresses of Others:&lt;/u&gt;

Do not give out others' e-mail addresses without first obtaining permission to do so.  E-mail addresses represent a vital component of one's virtual personal space.  As such, giving out e-mail addresses without permission constitutes a breach of trust and an invasion of personal space and privacy.

*&lt;u&gt;E-mail &quot;spam&quot; or &quot;bulk&quot; List Collection/Distribution:&lt;/u&gt;

Recent legislation has, in many states, created barriers and penalties to those who engage or utilize bulk- or mass-mail communications.  Common courtesy asks that individuals not collect other people's email addresses for such purposes.  If the virtual team in which you operate utilizes bulk-mail as a business process, netiquette standards require the inclusion of a genuine return e-mail address in which recipients may respond and request to be removed from future mailing lists.

*&lt;u&gt;Proper Personal and Business Identification:&lt;/u&gt;

The organizational structure of virtual teams often requires proper identification in instances of cold-contacts, solicitations, research and development, networking, and day-to-day communications.  When establishing a contact for the first time, include the following identifiers: your full name and title, company name, address, genuine e-mail address, and occupation or objective.  The utilization of e-mail address providers such as hotmail, gmail, or yahoo, is not recommended and can be perceived as &quot;cloaked&quot; or &quot;anonymous&quot; e-mail addresses.  The utilization of an email address that originates from your company is preferred.

*&lt;u&gt;Information Inquiries:&lt;/u&gt;

One of the great benefits that has arisen from the virtual expansion of today's global economy is the increase in available information.  The increase in available information has also catalyzed an increase in information transfer velocity.  The effective management of virtual teams also relies upon the ability to acquire, process, and use information.  Though requesting information from others is beneficial to you and your team, it can also represent a significant imposition and inconvenience to those individuals that you query.  In the process of information gathering, include the following elements: an explanation of who you are, and explanation of why you need the information, and an expression of gratitude.

*&lt;u&gt;Expressing Appreciation:&lt;/u&gt;

Each response you receive from team members, outside consultants, or individuals contacted for information, deserves a reply of gratitude.  Your &quot;thank you&quot; response should contain the following components: reference to the request (e.g. &quot;thank you for responding to my query regarding fossil fuel), your full name and title, company name, address, and URL.

*&lt;u&gt;A &quot;two-way&quot; Street:&lt;/u&gt;

Business is a two-way street: if you give, you will receive (and vice versa).  When something of value or substance has been provided you, offer return assistance, or extend an invitation to visit your website.

*&lt;u&gt;Proprietary Rights and Information:&lt;/u&gt;

Respecting proprietary rights and information is not only courteous, it is the law.  The expansive selection of information on the web represents countless hours of contributions made by individuals and groups.  The work of these individuals and groups is oftentimes downloadable or print-ready.  In any case, you must respect the proprietary rights of those who have contributed and/or created the information that has been made available to you.  Respecting the authors by using accurate and appropriate citations is essential to the protection and perpetuation of open-access intellectual property.  You should also respect copyright.

*&lt;u&gt;Courteous and Professional Virtual Behavior:&lt;/u&gt;
 
Courteous and professional virtual behavior is rooted in the most basic rules that govern etiquette.  When asking for information, use courteous language such as &quot;please,&quot; &quot;I would appreciate&quot; and &quot;thank you.&quot;  Failure to apply these basic rules may give rise to dislike, disrespect, and uncooperative relationships. 
  
*&lt;u&gt;Doing Your Part First:&lt;/u&gt;

The anonymity and potential loss of personal responsibility or obligation that can be pervasive in virtual forums placed the burden of responsibility on the requesting or interested party.  If you have not done your part, and contributed to the topic at hand, do not believe that you will be the recipient of free professional work.  It is necessary that you demonstrate personal contributions, investment, and effort toward your goal.  Seek advice, not cheap labor.

*&lt;u&gt;Admit and Own your Personal Level of Internet Savvy:&lt;/u&gt;

Do not be ashamed to admit that you are a newcomer to the virtual arena.  In this computer era, there remain a surprising number of people who lack computer skill and knowledge.  Many people in the virtual arena are prone to behave and act like mentors.  If you are a newcomer, utilize their offerings and remember to apply the rules of netiquette as you glean information and knowledge from them.  Own your respective level of expertise - and you will be respected.

*&lt;u&gt;Virtual White Boards, Chat Rooms, and Bulletin Boards:&lt;/u&gt;

Avoid using jargon and include complete words in conjunction with abbreviations.  Make sure that what you say is understandable to any viewer or audience.  Monitor yourself - answer questions that others have posed only if your response will add value to the general body on knowledge.  Do not respond with &quot;contact me.&quot;  The virtual community represents a fluid body of knowledge and contributions.  As such, it is not a place for foul or inappropriate language.  Respect breeds respect.  Do not use bulletin boards, chat rooms and white boards for blatant advertising purposes.  They are intended for networking and idea exchange.  If another person makes a contribution that is noteworthy or of value to you, acknowledge the contribution.   

*&lt;u&gt;Anonymity on the Web:&lt;/u&gt;

Virtual forums allow postings and contributions to be made anonymously.  In many cases, individuals have valid and legitimate reasons to maintain their anonymity.  However, one should never abuse the ability to contribute anonymously.  Those who remain anonymous in order to treat others with disrespect and cynicism are not acting as socially responsible virtual community members.  One should also remember that virtual forums are an excellent way to network with others.  If one were to respond or act anonymously, the ability for others to contact or network with that individual is impossible. 

*&lt;u&gt;Strategy and Opportunity:&lt;/u&gt;
Much of the virtual community, especially white boards, chat rooms, and bulletin boards, are regulated by organizers who post guidelines and an explanation of purpose.  By respecting and following these guidelines, your contributions will be more meaningful.  As a meaningful contributor to the virtual community, you will establish worth in the eyes of the organizers.  The establishment of business rapport in the virtual arena can result in business opportunities, services, and negotiations.  Let your actions and contributions reflect your personal strategy and opportunities may be opened to you.   

*&lt;u&gt;Maintaining a Professional Attitude:&lt;/u&gt;

Do not try to &quot;grab&quot; or pounce upon a business opportunity.  If what is required by team members or clients exceeds your level of expertise or is outside the bounds of your working relationship, refer the enquirer to a peer or other source specializing in that area.  Treat your peers with the same respect and consideration that you extend to customers.  Behave with integrity and honesty.  Do not substitute your best interests for those of the customer.  Maintain mutually respectful relations with peers and the entire virtual community.  Speak well of others.  Do not pretend to be what you are not.  Remember that virtual communication and relations are almost instant - never respond or act hastily.

; Opportunities :

Strong business contacts can be established through frequent interaction and steady communication in which netiquette standards are employed.  Negotiations and bargaining form an integral part of any business deal.  As a manager, you have a responsibility to your virtual group or team to promote netiquette standards.  By adhering to netiquette standards, your team will be better positioned and respected in the virtual community.  Some things that you can do to ensure the successful implementation of netiquette standards include:

* Establishing written guidelines for dealing with illegal, improper, or forged traffic.  
* Handle requests in a timely fashion - by the next business day.
* Respond promptly to people who have concerns about receiving improper or illegal messages.  Chain letters should not be allowed.
* Explain any system or software rules to your team members and ensure adequate training.
* Make sure that popular information has the bandwidth to support it.
* Don't allow your team members to point to other sites without asking first.
* Make sure your posted materials are appropriate for the supporting organization.
* Maintain a consistent look to your information.  Make sure the look and feel remain the same throughout your applications.
* Be sensitive to the longevity of your information.  Be sure that all sensitive materials are time-dated.

== Information Sharing ==

; '''Introduction''' :
Teams are formed based on the expectation that the teams will produce a better product than an individual.  If a single resource works from home or away from actual office you consider that team as Virtual Team.  Whether it is Virtual team or Team in the same room, information sharing plays a vital role for team’s increased productivity and success.  Information sharing is more problematic when the team is spread out geographically.  Virtual teams not only face a challenge with information sharing, but also task sharing.  In virtual teams if information is not shared correctly the whole purpose of the virtual team might be in jeopardy.  If one or more persons works from different place then sharing of information becomes very complex not only in the distribution of information but also in the information gathering.  

Virtual team can be a global team; global team is similar to virtual team where part of the team will be outside the country.  Because information sharing plays a vital role in team’s success, to minimize the impact of loss in information sharing whether it is related to the technical or application perspective of the work, one of the best way is to rotate the individuals who work from a different country or who are part of the global team or virtual team.

; '''Opportunities''' :
How transparent you run or manage the team, still most of the times it is hard to see perspective of the target or goal of a team, if part of the team is in a different place, where that’s country’s culture inhibits the resource to think beyond its culture or its system.  Team can have a rotational position, where one team member comes to onsite and learn the process or application and could go back to his country and transfer his/her knowledge he/she gained when he/she was at onsite.  Meanwhile team leader could bring another resource in place of first team member who visited onsite to learn more about technical, application, culture or process followed at onsite, and the first resource who went back could train or share the information or experiences to rest of the team, so that team could understand better about the depth of process, application, technical things in the project why things are done in such a way. By doing this the productivity of whole team would increase by proper information sharing.  Similar productivity can be achieved if team leader wants to bring different resource from offshore team once or twice at different times for a period of 3-6 months.  This system would be very cost effective if the ratio of whole team is 1:5, which means, 5 on-site and 25 offshore resources in a team.

Virtual teams can be more diversified geographically; because of this virtual team can bring more variety of information to share among the team to its success.  Team with similar background and experience could bring the same information to the team which can be considered as redundant, where you could not see the edge in the team compared to the information sharing with virtual team where chances of team could be from different backgrounds.

; '''Pitfalls''' :
Most of the time to share the information within the team, trust is one of the main factors.  Unless you know the person with whom you are working it is hard to tell what kind of personality is that resource.  Building a trust is easier when resources work together because you could know the person’s feeling when you talk with them directly.  If the resource is working from a remote location, it is hard to see the reaction of that resource.  In my work experience when I worked with remote employees many times, I ponder to myself whether it is accurate to share this information or not, because I do not know the person’s personality with whom I am working.  

Most of the times virtual teams are on different time zones and because of time zones, information might not be received at right time and could see delays.

== Establishing Ground Rules and Norms ==

; '''Introduction''' :
A team to succeed in its goal, it should have ground rules and norms set for the team.  Rules are useful in determining what kind of behavior is acceptable in the team, how team members interact, and when to interact in the team, which usually prevents misunderstandings and disagreement.

; '''Opportunities''' :
It is good to document the rules on common shared folder, so that every body could have access to the network folder.  When new member joins the team, it is easier for the person who is giving the orientation to new team member know what the ground rules and norms of the team.  Even when experienced resources aren’t around him/her, still s/he could communicate well in the team as well as outside team, if the ground rules and norms are shared with new member.  

Need to outset regarding the cultural differences if the virtual team is globally placed and address the styles on how to address if one arises.  

Members in the virtual team should learn to trust one another to create an environment where one should feel comfortable stating opinions and not personally attack each other.  Should not penalize for any miscommunication and should try to think with different perspectives. All members’ opinions are to be considered equal.  Disagreements and differences of opinions should be honored, should be given a fair hearing, and conflicts should be resolved by a defined process.

; '''Pitfalls and Solutions''' :
Virtual team should recognize the problem of resources working in time zones and organizing the team meeting and conference calls flexible to all resources in the team.  Updating the status reports to team leaders by timely manner, so that team leader could access the load of the work and assign it different resources accordingly.  

Hard on some resources, if the time set for the conference calls do not suit those individual’s time zone. 

Tough to be open and honest with one another to create psychologically safe environment in virtual team, but by taking some time to socialize before each meeting on general topics outside the events of the team work.  Messages could be taken wrongly, because there are no associated non-verbal messages indicating how to interpret them.

== Virtual Team Meetings ==

; Introduction :With members of a virtual team spanning different time zones, languages, and cultures, it can be complex and difficult to organize, optimize, and manage an effective team meeting.  Managers, who are sensitive to these issues and are diligent in their preparation, can get the most out of any virtual team meeting.    

; Opportunities :
*Cost: One of the greatest advantages of a virtual meeting over a traditional meeting is the low cost.  Airfare for corporate executives to attend a traditional meeting can be exorbitantly priced, especially in the aftermath of 9.11.  Participants can join a teleconference practically anywhere telephone service is available, reducing unnecessary travel costs. Many corporations have negotiated long-distance charges to an almost negligible amount, allowing employees to call across the world for not much more than an in-state call.
*Time: Virtual meetings can save valuable work time, even for organizations with closely located facilities.  Travel between buildings or locations can eat up precious time that could be spent on other tasks.  In large manufacturing companies, it can take 30 minutes to an hour to get from one side of the facility to the other.  Some managers waste half a day's work in just commuting between various meetings.  Given the price per hour of top-level executives' salaries, even a short traditional meeting can be very costly.         

; Pitfalls :
*Group Size: As with traditional teams, if a virtual team has too many members, this can break down communication and reduce team effectiveness.  
*Conference Call Domination: We have all experienced conference calls where various corporate department representatives huddle around a conference room phone to speak with distant affiliates.  The larger group, which is usually in the corporate office, tends to dominate the conversation.  In addition, larger groups tend to carry on side conversations that are inaudible to the people on the other end of the call and put them at a disadvantage.  One of the authors has also experienced conferenced calls that were &quot;hijacked&quot; by the ranking executive and used for a personal or political agenda.
*Common Language: Even if all members of a virtual team speak English, they may not speak the same English. Others may not be native speakers. English spoken in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States, and Malaysia is quite different.  

; Solutions :
*Keep group size to no more than 7 members.
*Again, keep group size small, including conference call groups.  If possible have some team members call in on their desk phones, to minimize side conversations.  In the case of a hijacking invitee, have a printed agenda with time allotted to each topic.  If the meeting gets off track, express your desire to not let the call go longer than expected and use the agenda as an excuse to change the subject.
*Use common terms that all can understand.  Avoid slang and metaphor, e.g. US sports analogies.  Speak slowly and clearly and ask for confirmation from all members that the discussion was understood. As in any environment, be sure to ask leading questions verifying that members specifically tasked with something have a complete understanding of the assignment. Many telephone conversations or conference calls have a few-second lag time.  Be patient and don't interrupt.

== Organizational Development ==

; Introduction :
Traditionally, organizational development occurs in a face-to-face or voice-to-voice mode, utilizing observation, personal interaction, and personal relations to develop or redevelop a coherent and appropriate business model or organizational process.  As virtual teams become more common place, the need for organizational development persists.  The virtual arena, in many cases, requires a modified managerial approach to organizational development.  

The management and development of a virtual entity may require that the execution of needs assessments, focus groups, and interviews, be done electronically via a collaborative software system or group support system.  These systems allow users to &quot;hide&quot; or &quot;disable&quot; their personal identities during information gathering sessions and interact with others under the guarantee of anonymity.  In some cases, employees and virtual team members may approach the process of organizational development with apprehension.  Anonymity, for the purpose of information gathering, may serve to ally such apprehension.  
  
; Opportunities :

*Employee satisfaction can influence the efficacy and longevity of organizational development.  There is no consensus in the literature regarding the impact of a virtual team structure on employee satisfaction. However, most studies indicate that participating in a virtual team environment and/or working from home can result in:

-	an increase of employee job satisfaction

-	reduced likelihood of employee turn-over

-	reduction in role stressors

-	increased satisfaction with supervisors

-	increased commitment to the organization

-	decreased satisfaction with peers

-	decreased satisfaction regarding opportunities for advancement and promotion

These findings emphasize the importance of measuring and responding to employee outcomes as part of managing in a virtual team environment.

*Videoconferencing is a useful tool that can be used to facilitate small group interviews and interventions.  The use of videoconferencing technologies provides a medium in which all participants can be viewed on each individual screen regardless of geographic location.  Some believe that this may be as effective as a face-to-face experience.  
 
*Research has shown that the medium used for teaching technical skills has no effect on students’ learning outcomes. One can use videotape, CD-ROM, videoconferences, teleconferences, web-based training, or instruction manuals.  However, some skills (e.g. communication and some management/leadership skills) are best taught in a face-to-face environment. In these instances, consideration should be given to the use of training centers or external training venues.

== Conclusion ==

The increasing use of global virtual teams demands special attention to differences in culture, communication barriers, and inherent trust existing among the team members. While these teams are not fundamentally different from traditional teams, additional focus and effort in some key areas is necessary to ensure team success. These include knowing the cultural differences that exist in the team and taking steps to educate the other team members and understanding how this affects how they should approach different situations. Because global virtual teams don’t experience the same physical contact that traditional teams do, extra effort is required from all team members to maintain trust and to promote practices that encourage team members to work well together and give reasons to trust each of the other members. It is also important to keep in mind that there is no set recipe for success in any team, especially global virtual teams. Only by understanding the challenges and differences between global virtual teams and traditional teams, management and team members can better prepare themselves and take advantage of their strengths to promote success.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Overbending=
'''Overbending''', commonly called overblow and overdraw, is a difficult technique to master. The physics is simple to explain: In overblow, a normally drawn reed would vibrate upon the blow airflow, and in overdraw, a normally blown reed would vibrate upon the draw airflow. This is the reason why it cannot be done on a harmonica with windsavers.

Because the opposite reed commonly acts as a buffer for excess air, this is easier said than done. Furthermore, on holes that have windsavers, this cannot be done. The sound is also harsher, similar to the sound of a hard pressed organ key.

Overblowing is done the same way as a bend in the upper register, by tightening the jaw, bringing the tongue up slightly, and trying to sound the desired harmonic. To improve overbend, one can make the gap between the reeds and the plate smaller.

On a chromatic, these can be done from hole 8 to 12. On a tremolo, they can be done on every hole.

=Ornaments=
==Approach==
Also known as grace notes, this usually involve playing a note a half-step lower/higher real quick and then play the actual piece. if nt indicated, this is usually fine in blues, rocks, and jazz. On a harmonica, you can use one of the following:
===Slide jab===
The technique is for a slide-in note. One will approach a slide-in note with the slide out, then jab it in quickly.
===Reverse jab===
The technique is for a slide-out note. One will approach a slide-out note with the slide in, then release it in quickly.
===Bend grace note===
use bending to bend the note half-step lower briefly, before playing.
===Glissando===
*Start with a chord right next to the actual hole, then quickly go to the actual hole and block out the rest with a tongue slap.

==Tremolo vs Vibrato==
Just like guitar's misnamings, Tremolo and vibrato on a harmonica are also misnamed. So let's set it straight, as per music theory:
*A '''vibrato''' is a fluctuation of pitch, usually accompanied with synchronous fluctuations of loudness and timbre, of such extent and rate as to give a pleasing flexibility, tenderness, and richness to the tone.
*A '''tremolo''' is a rapid fluctuation of intensity (loudness and sound pressure) without changing the pitch.
While all kind of musics use ornaments, remember, '''play it only when it is musically appropriate'''. Sometimes, it's best not to do any ornamentation, especially if it's not how one would play in this style (e.g.: Canon in D played in classical style is very different from playing in blues style)

===Tremolo===
====Hand/Finger Tremolo====
{{chapter stub}}
A hand/finger tremolo is achieved by rapidly opening and closing the cupped hands around the harmonica to adjust volume.

===Vibrato===

====Shake====
Shake is also known as warble.

====Slide Shake (&quot;Trill&quot;)====
What traditionally called as a trill on a chromatic is '''not''' a trill. As it involves moving the slide in and out rapidly, it is more appropriately a type of vibrato.

====Flutter tongue====
A motor-like sound generated by vibrating the tip of the tongue against the roof of the mouth, just behind (but not against) the teeth. Emulate this movement with the rolled R as in the Spanish word &quot;rapido&quot; (pronounced rrrrapido)

====Tongue vibrato====
You make vibrations inside your mouth with your tongue (depends, back and forth, up and down, or some mixed motion) as if you
were trying to bend the note using the tongue motion.

In simple words you just move your tongue back and forth very fast as if trying to whistle exhaling and inhaling the air. Don't use your throat or lungs for breathing for a while, just use the amount of air in your cheeks. Move the tongue really fast. In this case the trajectory of the air stream is not straight and pressure on the reed is somewhat mixed causing some kind of turbulence.

This effect is very impressive when used on a bent note with at least half of the tone room above and below. The best use of it in my opinion is by getting the deepest bent note, say, 2 draw 2-step bend and then do what was described above by adding some air pressure. 

In fine, when you vibrate your tongue the note fluctuates from the 2-step deep bend to almost pure 2 draw - with larger increment of time devoted to the 2-step deep bent note and smaller increment of time devoted to the unbent note or I would say to transition from 2-step bend to unbent note and back. That is, you are to hear the bent note almost constantly with transitory vibrato effect along the possible bending range. All this happens during the tongue vibration.

====Throat Vibrato====

Throat vibrato is one of the most important harmonica techniques to master.  It adds color and variety to your notes in the same way that it does for a singer, and it is intimately associated with good tone.  There are several different ways of achieving various vibratos on the harp, including diaphragm vibrato, hand vibrato, and throat vibrato.  Diaphragm vibrato and throat vibrato are closely related, while hand vibrato is achieved by opening and closing the hands to vary the air seal cup at the back of the harp.

Diaphragm vibrato primarily makes use of the diaphragm for altering the amount of air flowing through the harp, which provides a rhythmic pulsing of volume from softer to louder to softer.  Throat vibrato may be the most emotional of the vibratos by making use of pitch changes as well as volume changes.

The key to throat vibrato is a smooth oscillation of both pitch and volume.  Done poorly it sounds chunky, and not smooth. Done well it sounds smooth and natural and wonderful.  Strive for a sine-wave type continuous smoothness, with consistent pitch and volume changes.  Rhythm is an important part of the vibrato. You can do vibrato at different speeds, so you choose a speed that fits with the rhythm and feel of the music.  The pulses of the vibrato should be made to divide the notes into even intervals to add to the rhythmic content of the music.

The classic way to get throat vibrato is to imitate a rapid fire machine gun (eh eh eh eh eh), like when you were a kid. Then do it inhaling instead of exhaling.  It's the same throat motion that gets the throat vibrato. Work on it until all the chunkiness is gone, and it sounds as natural in your play as it does in a singer's voice.

A good way to get the feel is to put vibrato on the 3 draw 1/2 step (or even less) bend. Your throat is involved getting the bend initially, so there's some feel there before you go for the vibrato.  Breathing from the diaphragm will help control the vibrato.  There's always an interaction between the throat and diaphragm when doing a vibrato, since each is involved in controlling the air stream.  For throat vibrato, obviously the emphasis is on the throat--but you'll probably notice some involvement of the diaphragm as well.

Try it amplified, but play softly.  Practice very soft draw bends.  At some point you'll notice what feels like a direct connection between your throat and the note.  Every little nuance of throat motion is reflected in the sound.  Work on playing the 3 draw 1/2 step bend softly.  Then put some vibrato on the note by pulsing the air stream with your throat.  The pitch will change up and down because you've got a hold of the bend with your throat.  Keep at it, it's worth it!

====Combo vibrato====
This is a combo of diaphragm, tongue and jaw technique while bending the note. The diaphragm is working a quick vibrato, while the tongue/jaw are doing a pumping action to enhance and speed up the vibrato even more. Also, bend the note as you do this.

==Split intervals==
Unlike other wind instruments, a harmonica can play numerous notes at once. Aside from intervals made up of adjacent notes, a player can play separate holes by blocking the holes in the middle, and sound the two outermost notes. The split octave (below) is an example of this.

While the principle is simple, in practice, this can be difficult. Many people, have difficulty releasing airflow on both sides of a tongue block. Furthermore, for some intervals it may be difficult to stretch ones mouth wide enough. If one wishes to sound two notes which are separated by two holes this can be easily learned by first sounding all four holes (as in a chord) and then touching the tip of the tongue to the post separating the two innermost holes. For example playing blow holes 3, 4, 5 and 6, and then touching the tongue to the center post which separates holes 4 and 5, produces a split octave of C1 (3 blow) and C2 (6 blow).

==Rake==
{{chapter stub}}
==Shimmer==
{{chapter stub}}


=Octave=
If a player stretches the mouth wide enough, and blocks out a certain number of holes in the middle such that only two notes that are octave apart (e.g.: C1 and C2) will sound, they will form a '''octave'''.
:For chromatic, that means stretching out across four holes and then block out the 2 holed in the middle with your tongue.
:For diatonic, stretch out across four holes and then block out the 2 holes in the middle. Note you can only form a true octave on the blow, and just a few draw notes.
===Slide bump===
As player play a slide-out note, immediately bump the slide in and let it out quickly, which let it rise up a bit.
===Slide dip===
As player play a slide-in note, immediately let it out and press it back in quickly, which let it lower down for a short while.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The model here is to set up a client like app, and at regular intervals, call the server code's handler on a once through (no loop) mode. Note the odd way this is crafted so that the poll function is called '''after''' the orb's process loop times-out. So, what can happen here is that the handler can call out to other ORBs and the run() member of the local orb can act as a part time server. According to the TAO Developer's manual, the TCP stack will act as your cache while the poll function is doing its thing, thus, don't spend too much time in the poll function.

&lt;pre&gt;
  MyHandler ph;

  //Set up a delay value of 6 s
  ACE_Time_Value interval (6, 0);
  //Run the ORB's event loop and poll the bill acceptor
  while(1){
    orb-&gt;run(interval);
    ph.poll();
  }
  orb-&gt;destroy ();

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'd like to add a qualification to the voting rules along the lines of - please only vote for a nomination if you intend to help improve that book if it is chosen as the CoM. I'd intend this mostly as a reminder for people before voting. Intentions can, of course, change, and I would not seek to disenfranchise a voter because, from time to time, he does not help a collaboration he has voted on. But where we have voters coming here regularly, but never, ever, contributing to a collaboration they supported, then it would be time to ignore that user's votes.

The idea of all this is to help select the books most likely to improve during the month. A book four people are willing to actively work on over a month will improve much more than a book that twenty people agree needs improving, but where no-one wants to actually do the work, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:46, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

==History==
I've been going through this book and I noticed that the history sections seems a little too verbose for an elementary school textbook. Some of the language was much too advanced. I also seems too focused on the history of the written language and doesn't even mention the history of the spoken language. I'd suggest that it be reworked from scratch.[[User:Rmawhorter|Rmawhorter]] ([[User talk:Rmawhorter|talk]]) 01:32, 25 January 2008 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Functional and Psychological Impacts of Transitioning from Team Member to Team Leader */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The transition period of replacing a leader within a company is often a very costly time for not only the company, but all personnel involved.  In the 1992 study &quot;Turnover and Return-on-Investment Models for Family Leave,&quot; researchers J. Douglas Phillips and Barbara Reisman estimate that the cost of replacing a top-level manager is about 150 percent of the manager's base salary.  These costs can include: accrued annual leave, substantial severance pay, executive recruitment activities, interim management costs and numerous intangible and indirect costs.  This chapter examines how to successfully manage the transition from team member to team leader.  It is important to have an effective strategy for this transition because it has a direct impact on the future performance of the team and its leader.  This transitional phase sets behavioral norms for team members, establishes performance standards, affects members’ motivation, and creates the leader’s and members’ perceptions about their ability to excel as a cohesive unit.  Data from Development Dimensions International [http://www.DDIWORLD.com] concerning leadership transitions states that nearly one out of every five &quot;people managers&quot; rank transitioning leadership as the most challenging life event one could experience and at the strategic level, these numbers are even higher, often times placing transitions above divorce, managing teenagers, moving and even becoming a parent.

The managing leadership transitions chapter is divided into multiple sections and is designed to be either read completely or referred to simply as reference.  The first section examines the functional and psychological impacts that this phase can have on team members and transitioning leaders.  The second section explores the challenges that a newly promoted team leader faces when establishing influence over the team members who were once teammates.  The best methods for establishing influence over a team are also assessed.  Section three provides practical advice for newly promoted leaders to accelerate the transition process from team member to full fledged team leader, while setting both the leader and the team up for future performance success.

== Functional and Psychological Impacts of Transitioning from Team Member to Team Leader ==

Being promoted to a team leadership role brings many challenges.  One of the more difficult obstacles encountered is when promotion occurs from within the team.  The new leader finds him in a position of authority over a group of team members he previously worked alongside.  This can result in struggle for both the team and the leader as roles are reassigned and individuals adjust to the new relationship.  As companies and schools place more emphasis on teamwork, people find themselves facing this conflict of moving from peer to supervisor more often.  What may have once been an easy relationship based on shared experiences is now one of shifted dynamics and unease among the team.  Despite the increasing occurrence of this event, the transition rarely goes smoothly and often is unsuccessful.  In an attempt to better understand why some individuals succeed in making the change to team leader, many studies have been done to help identify root causes and potential solutions.  Among those concepts identified are social biases and role conflict. In this section we hope to further explore these concepts and the role they play in the team member to team leader transition.  

The newly promoted team leader may find them struggling with role conflict. He/she must learn how to balance the relationships built as a peer and the new responsibility of acting as the boss. Maurice B. Mittelmark’s editorial &quot;Social ties and health promotion: suggestions for population-based research&quot;, comments on studies which examine role conflict and its adverse psychological and functional impacts.  As applied to transitions from team member to leader, the article supports the proposition that new leaders will be less successful at managing the team and more psychologically stressed if the leader tries to maintain multiple roles, as teammate and team leader.  “The Role Conflict situation is that in which multiple roles… are perceived to demand too much time and attention...”  The article places “emphasis on multiple roles as the stress factor, not on too low capacity to perform as expected (although P [the team leader] may nevertheless take blame for not being able to manage somehow).” A real world example of the significant impact of leadership transitions occurs at a US Freightways hub in Holland, where they have been able to study the effect of transitioning terminal managers.  The US Freightways hub in Holland has 59 terminals and regularly sees a 20% annual turnover in terminal managers, thus nearly 12 transitions per year.  Taking the 12 transitions per year and multiplying that by the average effective time of 4 months per transition, US Freightways calculated that at any time, 4 terminals or nearly 7% of their hub were consistently operating ineffectively.  The calculations performed by US Freightways follow: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(59-Terminals * 20%-Annual Transitions = 11.8-Transitions per Year)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}&amp;(11.8-Transitions per Year * 4-Months per Transition / 12-Months per Year\\ 
&amp;= 4-Terminals Consistently Operating Ineffectively)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


When a team leader proves ineffective at managing the team member and team leader role, the psychological stress of trying to juggle multiple roles and consistently meeting deadlines will ultimately cause the leader to fail.  The failure is more often a result of this stress than the increased functional workloads associated with performing the tasks of team leader.

Role conflict can also occur because of commitment and the brain’s strong tendency to want to be consistent with prior actions.  For example, employees may lock themselves into certain roles by telling coworkers “they’ll always be there to support them.”  However, when those employees are promoted the roles change.  The promoted employees may find themselves stuck in certain roles because they want to remain consistent with what was said beforehand.  In the example where a supervisor has to layoff a previous coworker and friend, dissonance is created and will interfere with the supervisory role.  One of the first steps a new leader must take in order to increase their chances of success is to establish a policy for assessment and accountability.  The role of each team member should be assessed along with a focus on accountability for each role.  The leader is accountable for his team's results; each team member should know his or her roles and responsibilities.  By establishing clear expectations from the team, the leader will be better positioned to lead.  Most importantly, with proper planning and training on the part of the new leader, role conflict can be managed more successfully. 

While there may be resistance from group members for a variety of reasons, whether it is resentment of being passed over for the promotion or doubt of one's leadership skills, it is probably in the best interest of the new supervisor to deal with those people on a case-by-case basis.  Initially both the new leader and former peer may be hesitant to continue a social relationship outside of work; this does not have to be the case.  As long as both parties are able to recognize and acknowledge that work stays at the office.  In addition, the transition may be helped if the new leader is able to focus on the opportunity of the new position, not just for him, but the team. This will help in 3 ways: 

#  Provide framework to help separate coworkers from the leader
#  Make the promotion and new leadership more of an uplifting goal
#  Encourage new associations to be created for the promoted employee and the new set of peers (other leadership members)

== Challenges and Methods for Establishing Influence over the Team ==

Imagine that you have been part of a team that has been working on a project.  Having worked closely with each other for some time, each participant has become familiar with the skills and competencies of the other members and the team dynamics have been such that all consider themselves peers, having equal skills and knowledge to bring to the table. Now suppose that management is unhappy with the disappointing results that have come from this team effort and they have asked you to lead the team to the desired outcomes for which it was first established.  Would you expect this new appointment to be met with resistance from your peers?

Actually, team members who transition into a managerial or team leader role in the midst of an ongoing project can face a wide array of challenges in asserting their newfound influence.  Most likely the new leader is now in charge of his/her peers and it may prove difficult for team members to take direction from someone whom they still consider as an equal.  The transition period for a new leader is encumbered with a variety of resistive tendencies that may not only cause delays, but also a significant loss of focus which will lead to even greater problems down the road.  

Once the group dynamic changes, already existing social biases can be augmented or new social biases can arise that can further complicate the matter. Underlying social biases like false uniqueness, recency biases, and stereotyping can begin to emerge and become a prevalent part of the team atmosphere.  According to Gerardo Okhuysen in his article “Managers and Social Processes” these biases have the definitions described in the table below.  

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Social Biases
! Definition
|- 
| False Uniqueness
| The false uniqueness effect refers to the tendency we have to underestimate the number of people who do what we do, and like what we like.  
|- 
|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_effect Recency Biases]
| As we gather information about others or about situations, we give much more weight to information that is acquired recently, sometimes completely forgetting all the things that happened before.
|- 
| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype Stereotyping]
| This is a tendency we have to simplify the world by putting people into a category, and then fitting the individual into the stereotype of that category.
|-
|}


These definitions take on life when put in the context of practical application.  Returning to the scenario at the beginning of this section we can show how these social biases are applied to real situations.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Social Biases
! Situation
|- 
| False Uniqueness
| As you begin to lead your group of peers false uniqueness may arise when your team members respond to your leadership by thinking that if they were chosen to lead the group they would have handled it differently, when in reality if given the same circumstances they would have acted exactly as you have.    
|- 
| |[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_effect Recency Biases]
| While leading the group you may react to any negative feedback you are getting from your team by labeling them as inherently difficult or unyielding in spite of how agreeable they may have been in the past.  Your bias is a response to their most recent behavior and you have nullified all prior knowledge.
|- 
| [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype Stereotyping]
| As you take on your new leadership role the team members may now attribute characteristics to you that they feel are possessed by all managers.  They may attribute to you characteristics of pride, arrogance, and self interest rather than an interest in the group, whether or not you actually display these characteristics.
|-

While the competitive nature of many companies can certainly increase the likely occurrence of the above issues regardless of the influence the leader has; often these disruptions are signs that the newly assigned team leader’s authority is not properly recognized.

Interestingly, problems stemming from a lack of leadership authority are much more likely to surface when promotion occurs from within a team.  An example of this occurred in a small defense company in California.  The generation gap between the two main engineering levels was quite vast. As the project moved forward, inconsistencies in the management style of the senior project manager resulted in a prompt changing of the guard.  The most qualified individual was of the younger generation and was well liked by his peers for his outgoing and fun personality, but the project manager position was not all fun and games.  The six months that followed where riddled with faulty product development, severe lapses in judgment and many test series that were absent from oversight by project management.  Being promoted from within caused the new project manager to be put in the difficult position of having to be in charge of the same co-workers he amused just the day before.  

In order to lead effectively, a manager’s authority must be well established.  In Robert Cialdini’s book, ''Influence, the Psychology of Persuasion'', he determines “authority” to be the most effective method for leaders to influence team performance and describes the various aspects of authority as encompassing perceptual cues, such as titles, positions and appearance, concrete knowledge and expertise.

In general, superficial cues such as formal titles or a list of accolades that may lend to the authoritative image of an &lt;u&gt;unfamiliar&lt;/u&gt; manager cannot serve an individual promoted from within a team who is already well known to the group.  Managers who are promoted from within an existing team face a unique challenge with respect to establishing their influence primarily as a result of the perceptual components of authority. 

The logistical and social components of leadership transitions also provide a unique challenge to any new leader, whether he/she is from inside the company or an external hire.  Just as a strong functioning team can be one of the greatest assets to a manager and the entire company, an ill performing entity can rapidly bring a process to a screeching halt.  

It is almost certain that the new leader of any team will be different than the previous leader, be it in management style, attitude or vision.  These qualities, however good or bad, must be accepted by the entire team in order for them to collectively move forward and maintain a strong status.  In retaliation to change, a vault of resistive pressures may be unleashed toward the new leader ranging from severe lack of urgency and distraction to jealousy and animosity towards all management.  [[Image:Crime.svg|right|120px|]]  Project meetings can quickly become less orderly, employees can lose focus and general chaos ensues.  Many social biases including false uniqueness and stereotyping can create a wall between the new leader and his/her subordinates.  The reoccurring ideas that &quot;I could have done that better&quot; or &quot;he is a typical suit that does not know what is really going on here&quot; can slowly begin to implode the team environment.  Although many of these examples seem extreme, transitions in leadership often do cause logistical delays leading to a temporary rise in social bias among subordinates.

In a recent article by Sotiriou and Wittmer, “Influence Methods of Project Managers: Perceptions of Team Members and Project Managers&quot;, the authors present the findings of three separate studies that attempt to measure the importance of various factors relating to managerial influence.  “Expertise” was examined as a separate factor in the project management studies but showed almost identical ratings to the “authority” component, suggesting that these components are very closely related.  The studies also provided evidence that knowledge, when used as an influential method, is highly correlated to a project manager's overall effectiveness.  It is evident that newly promoted managers are therefore best served by leveraging their knowledge and expertise, to help establish authority within their new role.  Robert Cialdini however, identifies “liking” as an important factor in enabling people to influence others and he endorses a persuasion technique that leverages “liking” or friendship as a way for leaders to influence team members.  In a situation where a colleague is promoted to a leadership role, the new manager might hope to rely on friendship ties with former peers to help motivate the team and encourage them to take direction.  Managers choosing to use &quot;liking&quot; as a strategy for empowerment should be aware that  often times team members adopt a familiarity with the new manager that is consistent with his or her collegial or “friendship” role and therefore do not properly respond to the new supervisory role.

Once a proper blend of expertise, knowledge and &quot;liking&quot; has been established, management becomes further complicated by the familiar “us vs. them” mentality that is quite common in organizations.  While it is not always appropriate to rely on friendships to motivate and direct team efforts, it is still necessary to eliminate adversarial relationships between team members and team leaders.  Cialdini identifies “contact and cooperation” as valuable methods of unifying groups that may originally perceive themselves to be at odds.  “Conjoint efforts toward common goals” can help to overshadow contentious relationships and leaders often benefit from incorporating the inherent team challenges into a strategy focused on the major goals of the project.  This approach is echoed by Sotiriou and Wittmer’s project management studies that identify the “work challenge” as the overall most important factor contributing to the positive influence of project managers.  These results further support methods of motivation that emphasize creating a meaningful and challenging work environment to help transitioning managers become effective team leaders.

Managing leadership transitions is a very difficult thing to do, but there are excellent strategies that can help ease the burden on everyone involved.  A well rounded combination of expertise and knowledge will foster an authoritative position for the new leader.  The &quot;liking&quot; factor, often present when an in-group employee is promoted, can be very valuable in establishing strong positive influence.  However, one must always be aware of the potential social biases and resistive tendencies of   once peer, now subordinate employees.  Strong leaders should work toward creating a challenging and satisfying work environment that not only focuses the team on common project goals, but also demonstrates that the leader's influence can and will lead the team to produce effective and positive outcomes.  In the transition period for a new leader, the window of opportunity is short and he/she must be willing to make great strides toward establishing a solid influence over their team.

== Practical Advice for Accelerating a Leadership Transition ==

A change in leadership of a project team requires a period of transition for everyone involved, especially the new leader.  One of the best resources for practical and applicable advice about how to manage this period of transition is ''The First 90 Days: Success Strategies for New Leaders at All Levels'' by Michael Watkins.  This book offers a structure and framework to help new leaders manage and accelerate the transition process that comes with their new role.

The book identifies ten key challenges for any new leader.  We have adapted these ten challenges which can be applied when a project team member transitions into a team leadership role; later we will discuss the challenges we feel are most important for this particular situation.  The ten challenges are as follows:

# '''Promote Yourself''': Change your mindset to reflect the realities of your new position.  Don’t assume that what has been successful for you in the past will work for you today.  Your new position may require you to acquire and develop new skills in order to guarantee success for you and your new team.
# '''Accelerate Your Learning''': When transitioning into a leadership role within the same company or team, the learning curve will be less steep, but an open mind is vital to any new leader’s success.  As a member of the team, you were probably familiar with the industry, the company, your competitors, and the market, in addition to your own specific functions and responsibilities on the project.  However, as the new leader of the team, you may not know the exact details of your teammate's responsibilities, so learning about these from your team members will be essential.
# '''Match Strategy to Situation''': You need to understand the current business situation, and identify its unique challenges and opportunities.  As a member of the  team, you should have a good idea as to what the consequences and implications of transition will be, as well as a good sense for the team dynamics.  A clear grasp of the situation will help you to develop a winning strategy in managing and accelerating the transition.
# '''Secure Early Wins''': Building credibility will be essential to establishing your new role on the team, and securing early wins is the best way to achieve this.  Formal authority over your former peers will only carry you so far before your team members start to think, “I could probably do a better job.”  Securing early wins will demonstrate to the team that you can plan and achieve tangible goals for the group, and they will probably be more willing to follow your lead.
# '''Negotiate Success''': Perhaps the most important relationship in your new  leadership role will be the one between you and your new boss.  It will essential that you plan and execute a series of conversations with your new boss regarding his/her expectations; ask what resources will be available to help you develop your team.
# '''Achieve Alignment''': Ensure that your goals, your team’s goals, and the organization’s goals are all in alignment.  
# '''Build Your Team''': Inheriting a team can produce a variety of interpersonal  issues.  Depending on the nature of your transition, you may or may not be given authority to make personnel decisions immediately or at all.  A thorough and careful assessment of the situation will help when making recommendations to your boss, and assist you in your own decisions as how to restructure your team for optimal performance.
# '''Create Coalitions''': Your success will greatly depend upon your ability to influence people outside your direct line of control.  As the new leader of the team, you are the voice of your team to the organization at large.  You should not only build and maintain alliances with the people on your own team, but also with the key individuals within the organization who are necessary to the ultimate success of your team.
# '''Keep Your Balance''': Transitions are extremely difficult to manage; it is easy to lose perspective, become isolated, and make bad decisions.  To help maintain a balanced perspective, you need to develop a strong advice and counsel network both within your team and within the organization.
# '''Expedite Everyone''': You need to not only accelerate your own transition, but the transitions of everyone you work with – direct reports, bosses, and peers.  

The most important challenges that pertain to a team member stepping into a management or leadership role relate to those challenges described in numbers 1, 3, 4, and 5 from above.  What follows is a detailed description and how the challenges apply to each situation.

'''Challenge 1:''' “Promote Yourself,” relates to the psychological transition that a team member must make when promoted to team leader.  As discussed in section one, newly promoted leaders must change their perception of themselves and re-frame their roles within the team.  While it may seem that the re-framing would be most difficult for the leader’s former peers, in reality it is the new leader whose own behavior must change.  For example, team leaders will have to forgo the informal chit-chat and chumminess they may have formerly enjoyed with their peers.  Also, managers probably won't be included in all of the after-hours fraternizing or social activities of the team.

'''Challenge 2:''' “Matching Strategy to Situation,” is arguably the most important challenge for a team member transitioning to a team leader.  Without fully understanding at what stage the project team is in, a new leader will be unable to tailor the correct managerial approach to the team’s current situation; as a result the team will fail to achieve.   Watkins recommends using the STaRS model (Start-up, Turn-around, Realignment, and Sustaining Success), as a framework for helping to diagnose the team’s current situation.   A transitioning leader must identify the challenges and opportunities facing the team in order to recognize the structural implications underpinning their team’s ability to perform.  Those who move from team member to team leader likely do so as a result from an organization's need for realignment.  Often in a realignment situation, the leader’s challenge is to revitalize a team project which has deteriorated.  In this situation, the leader must challenge engrained norms of behavior, convince team members that change is warranted, as well as restructure and refocus the team.   These challenges are offset by potential strengths already inherent in the team; team members’ prior success serves as motivation for wanting to achieve future success.
 
Watkins’ assertion that transitional leaders must match their strategy to the team’s situation is in line with Hersey and Blanchard’s Developmental Theory of Leadership.   This theory matches leadership style to group maturity.  Group maturity is a function of time, and leadership style matches relationship-orientation and task-orientation to the group’s stage of development.  In the case of transitioning leaders, the group may be mature when the teammate is promoted to team leader, but because the dynamic of the team is now changed, the leader may need to adapt his/her leadership strategy to fit the formative stage of team development.  In the formative stage, the new leader should first focus on the team’s tasks.  After this initial phase, the leader should then heighten his/her relationship-orientation, while maintaining equal focus on task-orientation.

'''Challenge 3:''' “Secure Early Wins,” is essential for establishing credibility as the new leader of the team.  These early wins should be “team wins” as opposed to wins for the new leader.  This will help build the perception that the new leader is effective not just in managing his or her own work, but more importantly getting the team to work together toward common goals.  Watkins asserts that a new leader’s “earliest actions will have a disproportionate influence on how they are perceived”   New leaders are perceived as more credible when they display a specific managerial style.  This style, according to Watkins, consists of six components.  A new leader must be (1) “demanding but able to be satisfied” (motivating members to commit to and achieve realistic goals,) (2) “accessible but not too familiar” (establishing approachability without compromising authority,) (3) “decisive but judicious” (communicating the ability to take charge without making hasty big decisions,) (4) “focused but flexible” (establishing authority but consulting team members and encouraging team input,) (5) “active without causing commotion” (building momentum without overwhelming,) and (6) “willing to make tough but humane calls ” (ensuring decisions are fair and preserve team members’ dignity.) 

'''Challenge 4:''' “Negotiate Success,” is another challenge that is essential in almost any situation.  Ultimately, your boss is the main person who will be evaluating your team and your individual performance, which are directly tied.  So establishing criteria and tangible objectives with your new boss is essential.  Also, keep in mind that these goals may have been set for you by your predecessor, but as part of Challenge 3, you must evaluate these objectives and determine if they are still realistic given the transition period required for the change in leadership, this and other factors which your predecessor might not have taken into consideration.

As seen in table to the left from Paese and Wellins - &quot;Leaders In Transition: Step Up or Step Off&quot; of Development Dimensions International [http://DDIWORLD.com], communication and planning consume vast amounts of time from transitioning leaders.  In a study performed by Evolta [http://www.evolta.org/ngcms/v2/htdocs/index.php?cat_id=1000161]
, 60 –65 % of all transitioners make their transition without special support from transition-based help firms.  Often due to the fact that it takes transitioners 6 - 9 months to become fully effective and efficient in their new positions, a startling 35 - 40% of transitioning leaders fail.





Although the change in leadership of a project team requires a period of transition for everyone involved, the transitioning leader has many tools available to make the journey as pain free as possible.  Following proven strategies for smoother transitions and possibly seeking the advice of leadership transition training by companies like Evolta, transitioning leaders can not only reduce the time involved, but also increase their likelihood of success.

== Conclusion ==
This chapter focuses on how to manage the transition from team member to team leader, when working in a team-based organization.  With the reality that &quot;internally sourced leaders are failing 33% of the time&quot; and &quot;very few leaders feel that organizations are doing the right things to prepare their future leaders&quot; (Paese and Wellins), the pressure on transitioning leaders seems insurmountable.  Although the mountain is high, a key aspect of a successful transition is an effective strategy.  

The importance of a successful transition not only lies with the leader, but also with the future performance of the entire team.  The psychological impacts of the transitional period may include role conflicts and the animosity and personal doubt of other &quot;passed over&quot; teammates.  Stress and impaired functionality are often negative outcomes that commonly arise from role conflict and often the best way to overcome such role conflict is to simply  relinquish the prior teammate role and frame the leadership role as a definitive new challenge.  Once the new leader has successfully changed his/her perception from team member to leader, the leader must establish influence over the team.  Although this may be extremely difficult at times and require the entire team to overcome strong social biases, the results of a meaningful and challenging work environment are well worth the effort.  One of the best ways to influence a team is through a combination of leveraging knowledge, expertise and &quot;liking&quot; to focus the team around a common set of goals.  This combination of techniques not only establishes the leader’s credibility within the team, but it also primes the group to visualize accomplishing future goals under such leadership.  Finally, even with extensive training and a thorough understanding of the social biases that may be present during your transition, it is the actions of the '''leader''' that matter most.  We discussed topics like how to &quot;promote yourself&quot;, &quot;match strategy to situation&quot; and &quot;negotiate success&quot; as excellent ways to accelerate your transition period.  By opening your mind and following some of the aforementioned guidelines for leadership transitions, anyone can successfully transition into a coveted leadership role with confidence and finesse.

'''Example 1'''

''At a record store, 2 albums and 1 single costs £10. 1 album and 2 singles cost £8. Find the cost of an album and the cost of a single.''

Taking an album as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and a single as &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, the two equations would be:

&lt;math&gt;2a+s=10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a+2s=8&lt;/math&gt;

You can now solve the equations and find the individual costs.

'''Example 2'''

''Tom has a budget of £10 to spend on party food. He can buy 5 packets of crisps and 8 bottles of drink, or he can buy 10 packets of crisps and 6 bottles of drink.''

Taking a packet of crisps as &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and a bottle of drink as &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, the two equations would be:

&lt;math&gt;5c+8d=10&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;10c+6d=10&lt;/math&gt;

Now you can solve the equations to find the cost of each item.

'''Example 3'''

''At a sweetshop, a gobstopper costs 5p more than a gummi bear. 8 gummi bears and nine gobstoppers cost £1.64.''

Taking a gobstopper as &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and a gummi bear as &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, the two equations would be:

&lt;math&gt;b+5=g&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;8b+9g=164&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Advanced_Test_Reactor.jpg|thumb|&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;]]

Most of the radioisotopes found in nature have relatively long half lives.  They also belong to elements which are not handled well by the human body.  As a result medical applications generally require the use of radioisotopes which are produced artificially.

We have looked at the subject of radioactivity in earlier chapters of this wikibook and have then progressed to cover the interaction of radiation with matter, radiation detectors and imaging systems.  We return to sources of radioactivity in this chapter in order to learn about methods which are used to make radioisotopes.

The type of radioisotope of value to nuclear medicine imaging should have characteristics which keep the radiation dose to the patient as low as possible.  For this reason they generally have a short half life and emit only gamma-rays - that is no alpha-particle or beta-particle emissions.  From an energy point of view the gamma-ray energy should not be so low that the radiation gets completely absorbed before emerging from the patient's body and not too high that it is difficult to detect.  For this reason most of the radioisotopes used emit gamma-rays of medium energy, that is between about 100 and 200 keV.  Finally since the radioisotope needs to be incorporated into some form of radiopharmaceutical it should also be capable of being produced in a form which is amenable to chemical, pharmaceutical and sterile processing.

The production methods we will consider are nuclear fission, nuclear bombardment and the radioisotope generator.

== Nuclear Fission ==

We were introduced to spontaneous fission in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Radioactive_Decay#Spontaneous_Fission|chapter 2]] where we saw that a heavy nucleus can break into a number of fragments.  This disintegration process can be induced to occur when certain heavy nuclei absorb neutrons.  Following absorption of a neutron such nuclei break into smaller fragments with atomic numbers between about 30 and 65.  Some of these new nuclei are of value to nuclear medicine and can be separated from other fission fragments using chemical processes.

The fission process is controlled inside a device called a [[W:Nuclear_reactor|nuclear reactor]].  One such reactor exists in Australia at [[W:OPAL|Lucas Heights in New South Wales]] and many others exist throughout the world.

== Nuclear Bombardment ==


In this method of radioisotope production charged particles are accelerated up to very high energies and caused to collide into a target material.  Examples of such charged particles are protons, alpha particles and deuterons.  New nuclei can be formed when these particles collide with nuclei in the target material.  Some of these nuclei are of value to nuclear medicine.

An example of this method is the production of &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Na where a target of &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg is bombarded with deuterons, that is: {{nowrap|{{chem|24|Mg}} + {{chem|2|H}} → {{chem|22|Na}} + {{chem|4|He}}.}}

A deuteron you will remember from [[../Atomic_%26_Nuclear_Structure|chapter 1]] is the second most common isotope of hydrogen, that is &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H.  When it collides with a &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg nucleus a &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Na nucleus plus an alpha particle is produced.  The target is exposed to the deuterons for a period of time and is subsequently processed chemically in order to separate out the &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Na nuclei.

The type of device commonly used for this method of radioisotope production is called a [[W:Cyclotron|cyclotron]].  It consists of an ion gun for producing the charged particles, electrodes for accelerating them to high energies and a magnet for steering them towards the target material.  All arranged in a circular structure.

== Radioisotope Generator ==

[[Image:NM11_2.gif|140px|right]]

This [[W:Technetium-99m_generator|method]] is widely used to produce certain short-lived radioisotopes in a hospital or clinic.  It involves obtaining a relatively long-lived radioisotope which decays into the short-lived isotope of interest.

A good example is &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc which as we have noted before is the most widely used radioisotope in nuclear medicine today.  This isotope has a half-life of six hours which is rather short if we wish to have it delivered directly from a nuclear facility.  Instead the nuclear facility supplies the isotope &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo which decays into &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc with a half life of about 2.75 days.  The &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo is called the '''parent''' isotope and &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is called the '''daughter''' isotope.  

So the nuclear facility produces the parent isotope which decays relatively slowly into the daughter isotope and the daughter is separated chemically from the parent at the hospital/clinic.  The chemical separation device is called, in this example, a '''&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc Generator''':

It consists of a ceramic column with &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo [[W:Adsorption|adsorbed]] onto its top surface.  A solution called an '''eluent''' is passed through the column, reacts chemically with any &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc and emerges in a chemical form which is suitable for combining with a pharmaceutical to produce a radiopharmaceutical.  The arrangement shown in the figure on the right is called a '''Positive Pressure''' system where the eluent is forced through the ceramic column by a pressure, slightly above atmospheric pressure, in the eluent vial.

The ceramic column and collection vials need to be surrounded by lead shielding for radiation protection purposes.  In addition all components are produced and need to be maintained in a sterile condition since the collected solution will be administered to patients.

Finally an [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/Gas-Filled_Radiation_Detectors#Ionisation_Chamber|Isotope Calibrator]] is needed when a &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc Generator is used to determine the radioactivity for preparation of patient doses and to check whether any &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo is present in the collected solution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Operation of a 99m-Tc Generator ==

Suppose we have a sample of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo and suppose that at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; there are &lt;math&gt;N_0&lt;/math&gt; nuclei in our sample and nothing else. The number &lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo nuclei decreases with time according to radioactive decay law as discussed in [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#The_Radioactive_Decay_Law|Chapter 3]]: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
N(t)=N_\mathrm{0}e^{-\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}t}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}&lt;/math&gt; is the decay constant for &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thus the number of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo nuclei that decay during a small time interval &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}N(t)=-\lambda_\mathrm{Mo} N_\mathrm{0} e^{-\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}t}\mathrm{d}t 
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Mo decays into &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc, the same number of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc nuclei are formed during the time period &lt;math&gt;dt&lt;/math&gt;. At a time &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;, only a fraction &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}n(t')&lt;/math&gt; of these nuclei will still be around since the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is also decaying. The time for &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc to decay is given by &lt;math&gt;t'-t&lt;/math&gt;. Plugging this into radioactive the decay law we arrive at:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{d}n(t')=-\mathrm{d}N(t)e^{-\lambda_\mathrm{Tc}\left(t'-t\right)}=\lambda_\mathrm{Mo} N_\mathrm{0}e^{-\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}t}e^{-\lambda_\mathrm{Tc}\left(t'-t\right)}\mathrm{d}t
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now we sum up the little contributions &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}n(t')&lt;/math&gt;. In other words we integrate over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in order to find the number &lt;math&gt;n(t')&lt;/math&gt;, that is the number of all &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc nuclei present at the time &lt;math&gt;t'&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
n(t')=\int_0^{t'}-\mathrm{d}N(t')e^{-\lambda_\mathrm{Tc}\left(t'-t\right)}=\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}N_\mathrm{0}e^{-\lambda_\mathrm{Tc}t'} \int_0^{t'}e^{\left( \lambda_\mathrm{Tc}-\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}\right)t} \mathrm{d}t
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally solving this integral we find:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\Rightarrow n(t')&amp;=&amp; \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}}{\lambda_\mathrm{Tc}-\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}}N_\mathrm{0} e^{-\lambda_\mathrm{Tc}t'}\left(e^{\left( \lambda_\mathrm{Tc}-\lambda_\mathrm{Mo}\right)t'} -1\right) \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The figure below illustrates the outcome of this calculation. The horizontal axis represents time (in days), while the vertical one represents the number of nulcei present (in arbitrary units). The green curve illustrates the exponential decay of a sample of pure &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc. The red curve shows the number of &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc nuclei present in a &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc generator that is never eluted. Finally, the blue curve shows the situation for a &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc generator that is eluted every 12 hours.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Achieving High Performance Through Diverse Personalities ==

=== Introduction and Scope ===

Diversity in personality is like adding color to an otherwise black-and-white television screen.  High-definition, surround-sound, plasma TV is much more enjoyable than grandpa’s fuzzy, black-and-white mono speaker TV.  The scope of this chapter is to address the question of diversity in personality and demonstrate that it is not only possible but also recommended to achieve high performance through diversity in personality.     We discuss the ways to identify personality, contributor personalities, and inhibitor personalities.  We offer considerations and limitations to personality profiling.  We also provide links to professional resources and consultant firms specializing in personality diversity. Finally in this chapter we provide references and credible sources for this material.  Welcome to our wiki book chapter, enjoy.

[[Image:oldtv.jpg]]                [[Image:Plasmatv.jpg]]

=== Why Personality Diversity Is Important ===  	

There can be great energy harnessed from team members’ different personality traits if managed properly. Leaders must possess the skills to build their teams around the right personalities and to manage those personalities. We all see the world from our own unique perspective, our own paradigm. When we’re part of a team, we bring that paradigm to the team environment. Good and bad personality traits within a team can offset one another and build on each other and lead to synergies. Rather than ask each team member to conform to a group norm, leaders must recognize and utilize personality differences to ensure high performance.

Although some argue that personality classification is simply an attempt to &quot;quantify the unquantifiable,&quot; studying and recognizing different personality types can help you work more effectively with your peers. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself Temet Nosce] Learning more about your own personality traits can help you understand your own strengths and weaknesses, which can help in selecting team members that will complement you. Learning about others' personalities can help you develop the ability to view situations from their perspectives and improve your own ''psychological peripheral vision'' (Butler, 2000), which can be a crucial management skill to help make the team successful.

There are several characteristics of successful teams.  One such characteristic is diversity in team members.  Diversity in culture, background, age, and ethnicity are important for high performing teams, but so too is personality diversity.  All teams are made up of a diverse range of personalities, but it is the high performing teams that leverage their personality differences and mitigate and manage inhibitor personalities, to achieve their common goal.  Think about high performing sports teams and there is likely to be a cast of characters with unique personalities. Members of the Chicago Bulls in the 1990s were full of eccentric personalities. Dennis Rodman was the outspoken flamboyant player, Scottie Pippen was the often aloof team member and Michael Jordan was the fierce competitor. Each player was a critical piece to the Bulls' championship team puzzle. Each had his personality strengths and weaknesses. Their coach and leader, Phil Jackson, harnessed their strengths and managed their weaknesses toward a common goal. The Bulls won six championships and Phil Jackson became known more as a Zen master than an NBA coach. He later went on to win three more championships with the Lakers, successfully managing two diverse superstars in Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant. Jackson is widely recognized for his leadership ability and, specifically, his ability to motivate athletes with strong personalities to work as a team.

=== Achieving High Performance: The Real Reason ===

{{quote|Anyone can become angry – that is easy.  But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way – that is not easy.|Aristotle, 350BC}}

Emotional intelligence is the ability to use emotions effectively and many believe EI is the primary that determines high performance. The first academic definition of emotional intelligence was published in 1990 by Peter Salovey and Jack Mayer, of Yale University and University of New Hampshire, respectively (Freedman and Everett). 
 
{{quote|Emotional intelligence is the ability to perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth.|Mayer &amp; Salovey}}

Meanwhile and since the publication - researchers and academics, practitioners and consultants, and companies are investigating new ways to use their understanding of emotional intelligence to elevate professional and personal success.  Why?  Daniel Goleman, author of the best-selling book ''Working with Emotional Intelligence'', estimates that IQ accounts for only 4% to 25% on how well people perform at work and that the other 75% to 96% left unexplained can be, largely, attributed to emotional intelligence.

Goleman states that emotional competence is the more accurate predictor of the most successful people – not IQ.  For example, PepsiCo, conducted a pilot project where executives selected for high emotional intelligence competencies outperformed their colleagues, delivering a 10% in productivity, 87% decrease in executive turnover ($4m), $3.75 million added economic value, and over 1000% return on investment (Freedman &amp; Everett).  Not surprisingly, Johnson and Johnson came to the same striking conclusion: “Emotional competence differentiates successful leaders.”  So what competencies or factors go into the making of the successful leader or individual?  Goleman, created the following framework to define emotional competence:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''The Emotional Competence Framework'''
!width=&quot;100&quot;|Personal Competence
!width=&quot;100&quot;|Social Competence
|-
|Self-Awareness || Empathy
|-
|Self-Regulation || Social Skills
|-
|Motivation || 
|}

People with high performance have a strong combination of personal and social competences – in essence, high emotional intelligence.  So, teams that are high performing will have leaders and members who are a blend of Goleman’s emotional competencies.

== How to Identify Different Personalities ==

There are all kinds of ways to identify different personalities: look, listen, smell, touch, taste, and perceive.  Obviously, some of these methods might not be the most appropriate or useful, especially in the workplace.  

Many different personalities tests are available to test and identify different personalities.  Among these personality tests are the Big 5, Myers-Briggs, and the Color Code system. We choose to focus on the Big 5 since it is highly regarded in business and academic communities.  http://www.centacs.com/quickstart.htm#Background

[[Image:smallBig5.jpg]]The Big 5 focuses on five personality factors which help individuals understand themselves and their teammates. The following is a very brief summary:

; Need for Stability Factor : Refers to the degree to which a person responds to stress.

; Extraversion Factor : Refers to the the degree to which a person can tolerate sensory stimulation from people and situations. 

; Originality Factor : Refers to the degree to which we are open to new experiences/new ways of doing things. 

; Accommodation Factor : Refers to the degree to which we defer to others. 

; Consolidation Factor : Refers to the degree to which we push toward goals at work. 


=== Take the Big Five Test ===

Here are a couple websites that offer the Big 5 personality test free of charge.

== Contributor Personalities ==

While there are many personalities that inhibit a team's performance, there are others that help the team accomplish goals, tasks, and objectives. Some personalities contribute to a team culture that facilitates high performance and accomplishment. Other personalities simply keep things in check and under control. Having this type of diversity in a team's makeup of personalities can play a vital role in the team's success. 

=== Types of Constructive Personalities ===

There are many personality types that are very constructive and which help in becoming a high-performing team. A few of them are listed here:

; Silent Contributor : A person with this personality type is someone who gets the job done without saying much. They silently complete the tasks that are assigned to them, and very rarely create conflict. One must take care to balance this type of team member with someone who is not afraid to speak up, however, so that necessary communications happen for the team to progress.

; Devil's Advocate : This type of person is someone who likes to challenge ideas and processes. They act as an internal &quot;check&quot; on what you are doing and the processes you use. Although this person can generate conflict, oftentimes it is healthy conflict that brings ideas to light or helps to challenge biases. 

; Facilitator : People who like to keep structure to meetings, organize documentation, and make sure things run smoothly are often referred to as &quot;facilitators.&quot; These people facilitate the operation of a team by making sure everything goes according to plan, on schedule, and in order. People with this type of personality help to reduce the probability that chaos will ensue from random team members trying to accomplish their distinct agendas simultaneously. This is a &quot;control&quot; member of the team.

; Leader : Some people are really good a leading a team to success. This type of person is not afraid to take charge, delegate assignments, enforce accountability, encourage others, and facilitate success. Some are natural born leaders, others simply learn by doing. 

; Follower : A dutiful worker. Some people are really good at following directions and assignments, and they work very hard to get their work done on time. This type of person more suited to this type of role because they know how to work hard and are okay with following instructions. Having the bulk of the work taken care of by the &quot;followers&quot; allows the other roles within the team to take care of their functions.

=== Some Can, Some Can't, Some Won't ===

The truth is that some people are good at team collaboration, some aren't, and others are unwilling. 

Some people just seem to have the &quot;gift&quot; of working with and leading a team and ensuring its success. These are hard-working people with a mind for collaboration and putting the success of the team above their own ego. This type of person will help others acheive their goals by working with them to resolve frustrations, remove impediments, and create an atmosphere of mutual satisfaction. This type of team player encourages the rest of the team to work collaboratively towards the team goals. 

Others may not have collaborative personality traits within them. Although their intentions might be good, they may not see eye-to-eye with team members on processes, methods or goals. Oftentimes this type of person will be confrontational and impatient. Even though they would like the team to succeed, sometimes their own work ethic or personality gets in the way. This type of person can learn to work better within a team if they recognize their impact on others and are willing to make changes to their style. 

Some people simply won't work with a team. This type of person thinks they can get the job done faster, easier or better than the team could, and therefore simply will not cooperate. This type of person must get past their own ego if they are to work successfully in a team, and this type of change must start from within.

== Inhibitor Personalities ==

No matter where a person works, difficult personalities present problems and challenges in the workplace.  These inhibitor personalities cause a great deal of stress and are sometimes complex to address.  The temptation is to avoid people with personalities that inhibit logical workflow as it takes time, skill and effort to deal with them.  Personality conflicts are felt by all managers at all levels, but most avoid dealing directly with them.  A study of 250 senior professionals conducted in the United Kingdom in 2005 noted that half of those surveyed encountered difficult people on a daily basis (Berry 2005).  Despite this finding, the study noted that only 15% of managers actually confronted the inhibiting behavior.  55% tried to help by discussing the problems and 30% just ignored or put up with the difficult personality.  These findings are largely due to the lack of knowledge about how to deal with inhibitor personalities and the inability to confront the stresses involved.


=== Types of Difficult Personalities ===

To better understand the types of personalities that can be disruptive in the work environment, it is necessary to explain the types of personalities that inhibit teams in the workplace so that an approach can be applied to deal with each type.  There are four basic categories of personalities that can be found in the workplace: aggressive, deceptive, passive and destructive.

; Aggressive : People showing these personalities demonstrate hostile and forceful behavior toward others.  People exhibiting aggressive behavior charge forward in an attacking and forceful way to display the frustration or anger they feel but cannot resolve.  These people need to be heard and have a need to vent while at the same time needing people to listen to them.  Aggressive personalities include perfectionists, dictators, hostile-aggressives, attackers, egotists, bullies and criticizers who always say no to any request.

; Deceptive : People who engage in deceptive behavior aren’t comfortable with direct confrontation and prefer to attack from a distance from behind some kind of protection. People with this type of personality are still vocal and tend to either complain quite a bit without direct attacks or compensate for their frustration and dissatisfaction by being everything from sneaky to over-agreeable. These types of personalities include snipers who attack from a distance and always seem to have hidden agendas; overtly nice people who agree with everything until they are overwhelmed; “brownnosers” who have an unnatural attachment to those in charge as a way to get ahead; those who seem unresponsive to anything; and those who spread rumors to increase their own self esteem.

; Passive : People who are meek in the workplace present problems as well. Passive personalities are negative, but portray themselves as victims, always ready to dismiss any solution presented to them. Passive personality types include martyrs, passive-aggressives, moody people, crybabies, self-castigators, worriers, resisters, silent types and those who say “it’s not my job”.

; Destructive : People who exhibit destructive behaviors can be explosive and unpredictable.  Failure to understand this personality type can lead to extreme problems in the workplace that can create an unsafe work environment. This type of inhibitor personality includes people who are sociopathic and those who are substance abusers.

==== Aggressive Personalities ====

The aggressive personality type is forceful in what they want and demand that their issues be dealt with right away.  These aggressive inhibitors include:

; Perfectionists : Every detail must be perfect or the perfectionist becomes negative.  They are never satisfied with their own work and are own worst critic.  They have unrealistic standards and even work that is praised by other workers as the highest quality work is not acceptable to the perfectionist.  They cannot accept any kind of criticism and will focus on anything not perfect, even if that part is a tiny part of the overall work done.  A perfectionist manager tends to be a micromanager.

; Dictators : A person with this personality will make a great deal of demands on everyone and will try to tell them how to do their jobs.  They will walk all over the more passive personality types because they will let the dictator roll over them.  Dictators are often angry and hostile and have a strong need to control.  For the dictator, it is “my way or the highway”.

; Hostile-aggressives : People exhibiting this personality are pushy and demanding, constantly argumentative and can be hostile and abusive.  They have a need to stir things up and thrive on the chaos they cause. (Aldrich 2002).  These employees don’t care whether the reaction they get is positive or negative as they gain positive self-recognition regardless of the outcome.

; Attackers : These people demonstrate emotion-based hostility and aggressive that they are unable to control.  These attacks are not personal to the person being attacked, the attacker is just looking for someone to vent the frustration and anger for which he or she can’t find an outlet. Attackers are genuinely upset and need someone to listen to their pain.

; Egotists : These are attackers who have a superior attitude and think they know it all.  They charge forward with their disapproval of anything that they as experts feel is not going the way it should.  Egotists are arrogant and will disagree with most everything that is said because they like to be right.  They always find problems, not opportunities.  They often criticize others to make themselves feel better. 

; Bullies : The bully uses threats and intimidation to undermine others.  Bullies attempt to undo another person as part of their plan to retain popularity and power.  Bullies have an inflated view of themselves and is threatened by someone who is likeable, well qualified or attractive. (Guy 2001).  They will humiliate, destroy, discredit or intimidate another person to make themselves look better.

; Criticizers : A criticizer will strike down anything this is new, creative or different.  His or her mission is to disagree with anything that is said (Topchik 2006).  She will jump on any mistake and disagree with it with negative feedback.  A manager who is a criticizer exhibits it by always saying no to all requests.

==== Deceptive Personalities ====

The person with a deceptive personality type will not directly confront as in the case of the aggressive type.  This personality will instead work behind the scenes or from a distance to disrupt the workplace or gain favor.  These deceptive inhibitors include:

; Snipers : They use pointed jabs, humor and verbal sparing to put others down, usually from a distance and behind the scenes.  These people take potshots at others, use sarcasm as a weapon, lurk on conference calls to silently gather information, talk behind other people’s backs and go to great lengths to make their behind the scenes efforts untraceable back to them.  These people will not discuss their opinions in a public forum.

; Over-agreeables : These are “yes” people who have a powerful desire to be liked and appreciated.  They never say no to anything and are far too uncomfortable to voice an opposing opinion.  They are often overwhelmed with too many projects since they never say no to anything and are always positive in approach.  These people can be problematic in the workplace when they agree with one person’s approach and then also agree with an opposing position from someone else.

; Brownnosers : Also known as bootlickers, people with this personality type believe that the shortest way to the top is on the coattails of the boss.   They will exhibit a complete devotion and dedication to those in charge and will not ever tell the truth about their tactics or any of the boss’ activities.  They live in a constant self-reinforcing denial state that is perpetuated by the sense of importance bosses get from them.

; Unresponsives : These people are very hard to understand and to draw out because they don’t provide enough to work with.  They tend to be uncommitted to anything with work as the lowest priority in their lives.  They waste time, spent a lot of time on personal matters and try to get by doing as little as possible.

; Rumormongers : This is one of the more difficult deceptive personalities in that much of their negativity is spread through ideas and statements that are not true, but are hard to trace back to the source.  This person feels a great sense of importance when the rumors this person circulates force strong reactions from others.  Rumormongers tend to be very specific about what rumors they spread (examples include spreading rumors around senior managers, job cuts, salaries, competition and dating in the workplace), which maximizes the impact and increases their sense of self worth.

==== Passive Personalities ====

These are people with meek personalities and are often self-deprecating to a fault.  They tend to be moody and sensitive people who worry greatly, resist change, complain and need constant encouragement.  This personality type includes the following:

; Martyrs : This person is the one who comes in early, stays late, seems to not have a life outside of work and will do anything asked of them.  While doing this, they will also complain about workload, other employees, clients, managers and everything else in between.  The martyr always feels like her efforts go unappreciated.  They usually act defeated and powerless.  The martyr’s trademark statement is “I have given up everything for this company and nobody cares” (Topchik 2006).

; Passive-aggressives : People with this personality style lack assertiveness and feel out of control.  To remedy this, they find satisfaction in controlling another person’s life (Guy 2001).  They are very jealous and resentful and have so little belief in themselves that they can’t compete with another person without bringing them down.  Anyone that this person feels threatened by is subject to their anger, sabotage, deliberate procrastination and other tricks.  They often have good excuses for this type of behavior that clouds manager attempts to correct the issue.

; Crybabies : People who behave like children when they don’t get their way.  They withdraw, cry or go on a tirade.  They then act as if they are powerless in the same way martyrs do and usually believe everything that happens to them is bad (Manning 2004).

; Self-castigators : This personality shows itself in the form of constant self putdowns.  This person finds fault with everything he does, from work performance to salary to appearance to economic status to everything that defines a person’s self concept.  Even if the person is performing well on the job, he will not see it that way himself.  This person always takes the blame when something goes wrong, further enhancing negative feelings about personal self worth.

; Worriers : These people walk on eggshells and are very sensitive to any negative comment.  They usually complain about being too stressed and are expecting the ceiling to fall down on them at any moment.  She is unhappy with the way things are and is constantly pessimistic both at work and outside of it.

; Resisters : Any kind of change upsets the resistor no matter how small.  This person is only comfortable with the status quo and will resist any attempts to introduce new ideas and reorganizations.  If the change is threatening enough, the resisters will try to sabotage it or spread negative rumors about the change.

; Silent types : These people keep to themselves and don’t express any feelings or thoughts on any subject.  They work completely alone and even when placed on a team, will contribute nothing to the team in the form of active participation.

; “It’s not my job”-ers : These are very negative people who will reject any task that is outside of their perceived job responsibilities no matter how small the task may be.  They usually do this as retribution for a slight that someone in the organization has put upon them.

==== Destructive Personalities ====

These include people who have significant problems outside of work that impact themselves and others at work.  They include: 
 
; Sociopaths : These are people who lead double lives.  Their work lives and personal lives couldn’t be more different.  These are the people who portray themselves as supportive and charming, but in reality are cold and ruthless.  They act on their impulses without regard for the consequences on others.  Managers who do not detect that words do not match actions invite severely destructive consequences (Guy 2001)

; Substance Abusers : People with alcohol or drug abuse problems who try to mask their abuse at work.  They will sometimes work at a very high level and then drop off dramatically.  Absenteeism followed by plausible excuses are part of a repeating pattern that is destructive to the person and to co-workers.


=== Addressing Inhibitor Personalities ===

In dealing with all inhibitor personalities, the core emotional competency to be developed, first, is self-awareness: recognizing one’s emotions and their effects.  This should be common sense; after all, you must be self-aware of the problem before the problem can be addressed.  For instance, if people are lacking – social competence - in listening openly and sending convincing messages then they would be inept at leading and facilitating others towards a common goal.  If they lack self-confidence - personal competence - then it would be difficult to establish respect with others.  When dealing with the various personality inhibitors, the first step in addressing the issue it to identify the root cause of the problem itself. 

Adapted from Goleman’s framework, we created the “Emotional Competency Framework” table for leaders on how to address personalities that prohibit teams from reaching their full potential – the inhibitor personalities. 

In our table below, we made recommendations on how to address the four inhibitor personality types: aggressive, deceptive, passive, and destructive.  For example, to address the aggressive personality type we would encourage the aggressor to develop empathy and social skills; developing an understanding of others and sensing other’s feelings and perspectives would help them empathize and become less aggressive; developing collaboration and cooperation skills would help them work amiably with others towards a shared, clear and elevating without using aggressive, emotionally charged, tactics.

''Goleman’s “The Emotional Competence Framework” was adapted to this framework''

== Personality Profiling Considerations ==

Personality profiling can be a very useful tool in understanding your teammate’s communication styles, motivations and reward preferences. It can help you understand better how to relate to people and work with them. However, psychologists stress that personality type doesn't explain everything about us and that people with the same personality type often behave differently.
[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/personalityandindividuality/personalitytype.shtml]

Experts also agree that people cannot simply trade one personality type for another — that personality types are like left- or right-handedness — most people are born preferring one hand. Similarly, every person is born with a personality type, which means that people react differently to different stimuli. For example, an introverted person may find relaxation through focusing on memories, thoughts or feelings, while an extroverted personality concentrates on the outer world. No personality type is inherently better than another, although certain personality types work better together and some are more suited to certain roles on the team.


'''Profiling and Stereotyping'''

Although personality profiling is popular, it can prove to be a stumbling block if not used carefully because personality profiling makes use of stereotypes, which is often used improperly and limits one’s ability to see things clearly.

Walter Lippmann[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lippmann]], an influential American writer, journalist and political commentator, once said “For the most part we do not first see, and then define; we define first, and then we see.”


Lippman’s candid statement reminds us about how easy it is to assign someone to a certain personality type (defining them) without having all the facts.  Stereotypes and personality profiling can make us mentally lazy. As Samuel Ichiye Hayakawa[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._I._Hayakawa]], an academic and former United States Senator from California, explained that the danger of stereotypes “lies not in their existence, but in the fact that they become for all people some of the time, and for some people all the time, substitutes for observation.”


'''Drawbacks and Cautions'''

Personality profiling can be a very useful tool in helping people better understand themselves and the members of their teams. However, it can be detrimental if not used with caution. Following are three areas that could sustain damage: 1.) Oneself; 2.) Other team members; 3.) The organization as a whole.


'''Oneself'''

When people determine that they are a certain personality type (i.e. “I’m a Blue”) it gives them a useful set of tools to better understand themselves. However, it may be limiting as well. They might begin to think that they are not capable or suited to certain tasks because their personality profile says they are not. They may use the personality profile as a crutch which keeps them from growing in new areas or interacting in meaningful ways with others.


'''Others'''

In addition, when people immediately use personality profiling to judge the members of their team, they often make false assumptions that they understand their team members, when if fact they do not. While it is true that profiling helps individuals make quick judgments that can be useful in certain circumstances (i.e. the short-lived team with a short-term goal), people often do not go beyond those initial judgments to understand the motivations, work styles and personality temperaments of the co-workers.


'''Organization'''

Personality profiling is often used in the workplace as a method for screening and making decisions on whom to hire. Some HR professionals embrace the technique, while others do not. Although personality testing may be useful, companies need to be aware of the risks involved in using them to predict future employee behavior on the job. They may be exposing themselves to lawsuits or other legal problems if used improperly.

== Deep- and surface-level diversity  ==
By focusing on personality diversity, as opposed to demographic diversity, businesses may begin to study what David A. Harrison terms &quot;deep-level diversity&quot; (Harrison et al, 1998). Deep-level diversity consists of the attitudes, beliefs, values and commitment to the organization that different individuals in a group might have. This is in contrast to the traditional method of expressing diversity through heterogeneity in categories such as race, gender, or age, or what can called &quot;surface-level diversity.&quot; For example, the current thinking in deep-level diversity would account for the phenomenon that a male, Indian, engineer from the Punjab might be arguing alongside a younger female marketer from the midwest US to support a similar project approach. While the two are certainly demographically different, they may hold very similar values about work, economy, and share similar commitments to the organization. By exploring current information on deep-level diversity, not just surface-level diversity, organizations may leverage important performance benefits and avoid costly pitfalls.

It remains unclear if deep-level diversity characteristics can be discerned from personality profiling assessments. It is unlikely to match up exactly with the current discussion of personality types. What studies do show, however, is that the effects of surface-level differences diminish over time as the group works together and the importance of the effects from deep-level diversity in the group increases markedly. According to the study, &quot;Beyond Relational Demography: Time and the Effects of Surface- and Deep-level Diversity on Work Group Cohesion,&quot; the more work group members &quot;continue to interact with one another, dissimilarity in the typically studied surface level dimensions such as sex and age become less important than deep level attitudinal dissimilarity in, for instance, job satisfaction&quot; (Harrison et al, 1998) The authors state that the reason for this is that time is required for high-quality informational interactions among group members, in which they learn about each other's deep-level characteristics, and subsequently develop more meaningful, richly-functional, relationships. Further, Harrison also conducted a study that found &quot;increasing levels of collaboration . . . can reduce the impact race, gender, or age differences on team performance&quot; and that &quot;as team members continue to work together over time, personality and value differences surface more clearly&quot; (2002).

=== Recommendations ===
Harrison's research suggests that groups seek deep-level diversity in knowledge, skills, and abilities but minimize diversity in job-related beliefs, attitudes, and values. This can lead to what he calls &quot;especially effective teams&quot; (2002). However, he cautions that in order to be successful, it is important that such groups are rewarded for collaboration and &quot;that member's individual outcomes depend more on team performance than their own&quot; (2002).

According to ''FastCompany'', this type of deep-level diversity also corresponds to a higher ROI, service diversification, and sales growth, as well as more internal communication and an increase in assets (Davies 2004).

However, two elements of previous surface-level diversity problems seem to carry over even into contexts of deep-level diversity: first, increased diversity on both levels is still associated with an increase in turnover and integration and coordination problems; second, it still appears that in the supervisor/subordinate relationship, subordinates with the same gender as their superiors receive higher performance evaluations (Davies 2004).

== Conclusion ==

Insights into how personality diversity affects the work group have increased as the study of personality types, profiles, emotional IQ, and deep-level attitudes has grown. Instead of thinking of diversity as simply demographic differences, group managers will need to research, experiment, and analyze the ways in which all of these aspects not only affect the group, but how they can be integrated into a cohesive approach that corresponds to group cohesiveness and successful performance.

      <comment>/* Chapter Review: Atomic &amp; Nuclear Structure */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the final chapter of a wikibook entitled [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine Basics Physics of Nuclear Medicine],  written originally by [mailto:kieranmaher@mac.com Kieran Maher] in 1997.

== Chapter Review: Atomic &amp; Nuclear Structure ==
* The atom consists of two components - a nucleus (positively charged) and an electron cloud (negatively charged);
* The radius of the nucleus is about 10,000 times smaller than that of the atom;
* The nucleus can have two component particles - '''neutrons''' (no charge) and '''protons''' (positively charged) - collectively called '''nucleons''';
* The mass of a proton is about equal to that of a neutron - and is about 1,840 times that of an electron;
* The number of protons equals the number of electrons in an isolated atom;
* The '''Atomic Number''' specifies the number of protons in a nucleus;
* The '''Mass Number''' specifies the number of nucleons in a nucleus;
* '''Isotopes''' of elements have the same atomic number but different mass numbers;
* Isotopes are classified by specifying the element's chemical symbol preceded by a superscript giving the mass number and a subscript giving the atomic number;
* The '''atomic mass unit''' is defined as 1/12th the mass of the stable, most commonly occurring isotope of carbon (i.e. C-12);
* '''Binding energy''' is the energy which holds the nucleons together in a nucleus and is measured in '''electron volts''' (eV);
* To combat the effect of the increase in electrostatic repulsion as the number of protons increases, the number of neutrons increases more rapidly - giving rise to the '''Nuclear Stability Curve''';
* There are ~2450 isotopes of ~100 elements and the unstable isotopes lie above or below the Nuclear Stability Curve;
* Unstable isotopes attempt to reach the stability curve by splitting into fragments ('''fission''') or by emitting particles/energy ('''radioactivity''');
* Unstable isotopes &lt;=&gt; radioactive isotopes &lt;=&gt; radioisotopes &lt;=&gt; radionuclides;
* ~300 of the ~2450 isotopes are found in nature - the rest are produced artificially.

== Chapter Review: Radioactive Decay ==
* '''Fission''': Some heavy nuclei decay by splitting into 2 or 3 fragments plus some neutrons.  These fragments form new nuclei which are usually radioactive;
* '''Alpha Decay''':  Two protons and two neutrons leave the nucleus together in an assembly known as an '''alpha-particle''';
* An alpha-particle is a He-4 nucleus;
* '''Beta Decay - Electron Emission''':  Certain nuclei with an excess of neutrons may reach stability by converting a neutron into a proton with the emission of a '''beta-minus particle''';
* A beta-minus particle is an electron;
* '''Beta Decay - Positron Emission''':  When the number of protons in a nucleus is in excess, the nucleus may reach stability by converting a proton into a neutron with the emission of a '''beta-plus particle''';
* A beta-plus particle is a '''positron''';
* Positrons '''annihilate''' with electrons to produce two back-to-back gamma-rays;
* '''Beta Decay - Electron Capture''':  An inner orbital electron is attracted into the nucleus where it combines with a proton to form a neutron;
* Electron capture is also known as '''K-capture''';
* Following electron capture, the excited nucleus may give off some gamma-rays.  In addition, as the vacant electron site is filled, an X-ray is emitted;
* '''Gamma Decay - Isomeric Transition''':  A nucleus in an excited state may reach its ground state by the emission of a gamma-ray;
* A gamma-ray is an electromagnetic photon of high energy;
* '''Gamma Decay - Internal Conversion''': the excitation energy of an excited nucleus is given to an atomic electron.

== Chapter Review: The Radioactive Decay Law ==
* The radioactive decay law in equation form;   
* Radioactivity is the number of radioactive decays per unit time;
* The '''decay constant''' is defined as the fraction of the initial number of radioactive nuclei which decay in unit time;
* '''Half Life''':  The time taken for the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample to reduce by a factor of two;
* Half Life = (0.693)/(Decay Constant);
* The SI Unit of radioactivity is the '''becquerel''' (Bq) 
* 1 Bq = one radioactive decay per second;
* The traditional unit of radioactivity is the '''curie''' (Ci);
* 1 Ci = 3.7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; radioactive decays per second.

== Chapter Review: Units of Radiation Measurement ==
* '''Exposure''' expresses the intensity of an X- or gamma-ray beam;
* The SI unit of exposure is the '''coulomb per kilogram''' (C/kg);
* 1 C/kg = The quantity of X- or gamma-rays such that the associated electrons emitted per kg of air at STP produce in air ions carrying 1 coulomb of electric charge;
* The traditional unit of exposure is the '''roentgen''' (R);
* 1 R = The quantity of X- or gamma-rays such that the associated  electrons emitted per kg of air at STP produce in air ions carrying 2.58 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; coulombs of electric charge;
* The '''exposure rate''' is the exposure per unit time, e.g. C/kg/s;
* '''Absorbed dose''' is the radiation energy absorbed per unit mass of absorbing material;
* The SI unit of absorbed dose is the '''gray''' (Gy);
* 1 Gy = The absorption of 1 joule of radiation energy per kilogram of material;
* The traditional unit of absorbed dose is the '''rad''';
* 1 rad = The absorption of 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; joules of radiation energy per kilogram of material;
* The '''Specific Gamma-Ray Constant''' expresses the exposure rate produced by the gamma-rays from a radioisotope;
* The Specific Gamma-Ray Constant is expressed in SI units in C/kg/s/Bq at 1 m;
* Exposure from an X- or gamma-ray source follows the '''Inverse Square Law''' and decreases with the square of the distance from the source.

== Chapter Review: Interaction of Radiation with Matter ==
* '''Alpha-Particles''': 
** exert considerable electrostatic attraction on the outer orbital electrons of atoms near which they pass and cause ionisations;
** travel in straight lines - except for rare direct collisions with nuclei of atoms in their path;
** energy is always discrete.
* '''Beta-Minus Particles''': 
** attracted by nuclei and repelled by electron clouds as they pass through matter and cause ionisations;
** have a tortuous path;
** have a range of energies;
** range of energies results because two particles are emitted - a beta-particle and a '''neutrino'''.
* '''Gamma-Rays''': 
** energy is always discrete;
** have many modes of interaction with matter;
** important interactions for nuclear medicine imaging (and radiography) are the Photoelectric Effect and the Compton Effect.
* '''Photoelectric Effect''': 
** when a gamma-ray collides with an orbital electron, it may transfer all its energy to the electron and cease to exist;
** the electron can leave the atom with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the gamma-ray less the orbital binding energy;
** a positive ion is formed when the electron leaves the atom;
** the electron is called a '''photoelectron''';
** the photoelectron can cause further ionisations;
** subsequent X-ray emission as the orbital vacancy is filled.
* '''Compton Effect''': 
** A gamma-ray may transfer only part of its energy to a valence electron which is essentially free; ** gives rise to a scattered gamma-ray;
** is sometimes called Compton Scatter;
** a positive ion results;
* '''Attenuation''' is term used to describe both absorption and scattering of radiation.

== Chapter Review: Attenuation of Gamma-Rays == 
* Attenuation of a narrow-beam of gamma-rays increases as the thickness, the density and the atomic number of the absorber increases;
* Attenuation of a narrow-beam of gamma-rays decreases as the energy of the gamma-rays increases;
* Attenuation of a narrow beam is described by an equation;  
* the '''Linear Attenuation Coefficient''' is defined as the fraction of the incident intensity absorbed in a unit distance of the absorber;
* Linear attenuation coefficients are usually expressed in units of cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;;
* the '''Half Value Layer''' is the thickness of absorber required to reduce the intensity of a radiation beam by a factor of 2;
* Half Value Layer = (0.693)/(Linear Attenuation Coefficient);
* the '''Mass Attenuation Coefficient''' is given by the linear attenuation coefficient divided by the density of the absorber;
* Mass attenuation coefficients are usually expressed in units of cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Chapter Review: Gas-Filled Detectors ==
* Gas-filled detectors include the '''ionisation chamber''', the '''proportional counter''' and the '''Geiger counter''';
* They operate on the basis of ionisation of gas atoms by the incident radiation, where the positive ions and electrons produced are collected by electrodes;
* An '''ion pair''' is the term used to describe a positive ion and an electron;
* The operation of gas-filled detectors is critically dependent on the magnitude of the applied dc voltage;
* The output voltage of an ionisation chamber can be calculated on the basis of the capacitance of the chamber;
* A very sensitive amplifier is required to measure voltage pulses produced by an ionisation chamber;
* The gas in ionisation chambers is usually air;
* Ionisation chambers are typically used to measure radiation exposure (in a device called an '''Exposure Meter''') and radioactivity (in a device called an '''Isotope Calibrator''');
* The total charge collected in a proportional counter may be up to 1000 times the charge produced initially by the radiation;
* The initial ionisation triggers a complete gas breakdown in a Geiger counter;
* The gas in a Geiger counter is usually an inert gas;
* The gas breakdown must be stopped in order to prepare the Geiger counter for a new event by a process called '''quenching''';
* Two types of quenching are possible: electronic quenching and the use of a '''quenching gas''';
* Geiger counters suffer from '''dead time''', a small period of time following the gas breakdown when the counter is inoperative;
* The true count rate can be determined from the actual count rate and the dead time using an equation;
* The value of the applied dc voltage in a Geiger counter is critical, but high stability is not required.

== Chapter Review: Scintillation Detectors ==
* NaI(Tl) is a scintillation crystal widely used in nuclear medicine;
* The crystal is coupled to a '''photomultiplier tube''' to generate a voltage pulse representing the energy deposited in the crystal by the radiation;
* A very sensitive amplifier is needed to measure such voltage pulses;
* The voltages pulses range in amplitude depending on how the radiation interacts with the crystal, i.e. the pulses form a spectrum whose shape depends on the interaction mechanisms involved, e.g. for medium-energy gamma-rays used in in-vivo nuclear medicine: the Compton effect and the Photoelectric effect;
* A '''Gamma-Ray Energy Spectrum''' for a medium-energy, monoenergetic gamma-ray emitter consists (simply) of a Compton Smear and a Photopeak;
* '''Pulse Height Analysis''' is used to discriminate the amplitude of voltage pulses;
* A pulse height analyser (PHA) consists of a '''lower level discriminator''' (which passes voltage pulses which are than its setting) and an '''upper level discriminator''' (which passes voltage pulses lower than its setting);
* The result is a variable width window which can be placed anywhere along a spectrum, or used to scan a spectrum;
* A '''single channel analyser''' (SCA) consists of a single PHA with a scaler and a ratemeter;
* A '''multi-channel analyser''' (MCA) is a computer-controlled device which can acquire data from many windows simultaneously.

== Chapter Review: Nuclear Medicine Imaging Systems ==
* A '''gamma camera''' consists of a large diameter (25-40 cm) NaI(Tl) crystal, ~1 cm thick;
* The crystal is viewed by an array of 37-91 PM tubes;
* PM tubes signals are processed by a position circuit which generates +/- X and +/- Y signals;
* These position signals are summed to form a '''Z signal''' which is fed to a pulse height analyser;
* The +/- X, +/- Y and discriminated Z signals are sent to a computer for digital image processing;
* A '''collimator''' is used to improve the spatial resolution of a gamma-camera;
* Collimators typically consist of a Pb plate containing a large number of small holes;
* The most common type is a '''parallel''' multi-hole collimator;
* The most resolvable area is directly in front of a collimator;
* Parallel-hole collimators vary in terms of the number of holes, the hole diameter, the length of each hole and the septum thickness - the combination of which affect the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the imaging system;
* Other types include the '''diverging'''-hole collimator (which generates minified images), the '''converging'''-hole collimator (which generates magnified images) and the '''pin-hole''' collimator (which generates magnified inverted images);
* Conventional imaging with a gamma camera is referred to as '''Planar Imaging''', i.e. a 2D image portraying a 3D object giving superimposed details and no depth information;
* '''Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography''' (SPECT) produces images of slices through the body;
* SPECT uses a gamma camera to record images at a series of angles around the patient;
* The resultant data can be processed using a '''Filtered Back Projection''' method;
* SPECT gamma-cameras can have one, two or three camera heads;
* '''Positron Emission Tomography''' (PET) also produces images of slices through the body;
* PET exploits the positron annihilation process where two 0.51 MeV back-to-back gamma-rays are produced;
* If these gamma-rays are detected, their origin will lie on a line joining two of the detectors of the ring of detectors which encircles the patient;
* A '''Time-of-Flight''' method can be used to localise their origin;
* PET systems require on-site or nearby '''cyclotron''' to produce short-lived radioisotopes, such as C-11, N-13, O-15 and F-18.

== Chapter Review: Production of Radioisotopes ==
* Naturally-occurring radioisotopes generally have long half lives and belong to relatively heavy elements - and are therefore unsuitable for medical diagnostic applications;
* Medical diagnostic radioisotopes are generally produced artificially;
* The '''fission''' process can be exploited so that radioisotopes of interest can be separated chemically from fission products;
* A '''cyclotron''' can be used to accelerate charged particles up to high energies so that they to collide into a target of the material to be activated;
* A radioisotope generator is generally used in hospitals to produce short-lived radioisotopes;
* A '''technetium-99m generator''' consists of an alumina column containing Mo-99, which decays into Tc-99m;
* Saline is passed through the generator to elute the Tc-99m - the resulting solution is called '''sodium pertechnetate''';
* Both positive pressure and negative pressure generators are in use;
* An '''isotope calibrator''' is needed when a Tc-99m generator is used in order to determine the activity for preparation of patient doses and to test whether any Mo-99 is present in the collected solution.

      <comment>/* How Are Diverse Teams Different From Homogenous Ones? */  Correct sp (homogeneous)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== What Is Diversity? ==

Team Diversity is the significant uniqueness of each individual on a team. This should not only include the usual diverse selections such as religion, sex, age, and race, but also additional unique personality characteristics such as introverts and extroverts, liberals and conservatives, etc.  All of these differences can affect team interactions and performance.  However, not all differences affect team performance.  For the purposes of this chapter, differences are considered to affect diversity when they significantly affect team performance.

== How Are Diverse Teams Different From Homogeneous Ones? ==

Aside from the actual differences that create diversity, diverse teams have different challenges, benefits, and pitfalls than homogeneous ones.  The main benefit is that a diverse background fosters a creative environment.  The main pitfall is that differences between team members can lead to destructive violence.
  
The differences that are most commonly thought of as separating diverse teams from homogeneous ones are easily observed stereotypes.  The following list categorizes the physical and social differences (excluding actual workplace experience) that most frequently create a diverse environment:

; Gender : Gender communication issues can strongly affect team interactions.  Gender communication issues can range from communication styles and perceptions, opportunities and even sexual harassment.

; Race : Race is defined as a group of people, often of a common geographic origin, that share genetically transmitted physical characteristics.  Racism is the belief that these inherited characteristics affect an individual’s behavior or abilities.

; Cultural :  Culture refers to the standards of social interaction, value and beliefs from a given group of people.  Cultural issues can affect team interactions through different understandings of communication or family and can appear to be an excuse for preferential treatment.

; Age : Age can be a concern along the entire spectrum; is someone too young or too old to do a job? It also creates the potential for communication problems based on different levels of experience, and for prejudicial treatment based on age.

; Sexual orientation : With the increasing visibility of gender minorities such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, there are increasing workplace issues.  From simply not understanding gender differences, to being morally opposed to them, sexual orientation can create blocks to productive team interactions.

; Disabilities : Differences in ability often create difficulties in communication and emotional interactions.  Whether it is a deaf individual not being able to communicate with hearing individuals, or a hearing individual being unsure of how to approach a deaf individual, disabilities present a variety of issues in team organizations. 

By definition, diversity means that there will be an increased likelihood for a wider range of views to be present.  This includes views that are likely to challenge widely accepted views of the team and its culture.  The existence of these diverse views is essential to the process of organizational change.  In addition, as teams are becoming increasingly global, diversity can help an organization or team to understand its place in its surroundings.  

The differences inherent in a diverse team environment also cause challenges.  The benefits of having diverse backgrounds do not occur without having team members that are dedicated to success and a common goal.  The preconceived notions about differences in other people, such as racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, etc, disrupt work processes and can prevent teams from achieving their goals.  Simple misunderstandings can arise from basic cultural differences, communication styles or work attitudes, and create challenge.
	
Diversity in teams has benefits and creates challenges.  However, by being aware of these challenges and how to address them, teams and team managers can overcome them and reach success.

== Team Relationships ==

In today’s job market, leaders must be especially aware of diversity, and how to manage it to the best effect.  How can leaders do this?  First they need to focus on treating every individual fairly and respectfully.  In the article &quot;Handling Conflict in a Diverse Work Environment&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pledger, Marcia, &quot;Handling Conflict in a Diverse Work Environment&quot;, Black Enterprise Magazine, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;,   published in Black Enterprise Magazine, Marcia Pledger suggests the following.

First, leaders need to establish relationships of trust with their employees.  If an employee does not trust his leader, they will not be able to discuss issues of real significance.  There will always be a wall between the leader and the employee that will result in strained relationships over the long run.

The United States Marine Corps faced this problem in the early 1990’s.  In answer to this problem, the Marine Corps instituted a new training program titled “Team Marine” that helped the Marine leadership focus on what their subordinates brought to their teams.  They developed a set of expectations as to what belonging to Corps meant: 

* We expect to actively contribute to the team and to be recognized for our contributions. 
* We expect to be judged fairly and to be recognized and rewarded for our performance. 
* We expect the opportunity to develop our abilities. 
* We expect to be treated professionally and respectfully by other members of our team. 
* We expect to be valued as unique individuals. 

By following this set of principles the Marine Corps has managed to take what is one of the most diverse workforces in the world and unified them as contributing individuals with a common goal.

Leaders need to seek input from their employees on how they prefer to be managed.  In the article &quot;Dealing with the New Diversity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maccoby, Michael, &quot;Dealing with the New Diversity&quot;, Research Technology Management, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;, author Michael Maccoby relates the story of an engineering company that was the result of a merger between a German, Swiss and Swedish firm.  The management styles differed between each of the original companies based upon their nation of origin.  This lead to many problems as engineers from one country were asked to serve under leaders from another.  The company was not able to perform at its best until they discussed their differences and were able to determine a common management style for the entire company.  

Leaders need to develop a common focus.  Most people realize that everyone is different; however, by focusing on the job at hand, leaders can take the focus off the differences that are present.  As teams achieve successful results they develop a bond which helps to solidify the team, and overcome differences.

== Team Structure ==

In a diverse team, as with any team, communication needs to be open and safe.  It is the team leader's responsibility to set up this safe environment.  The team leader should instill confidence in the other members that what they are thinking can be discussed “as long as it is done respectfully.”&lt;ref&gt;LaFasto, When Teams Work Best Pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt;     

Behaviors should be agreed upon before an &quot;open and safe&quot; discussion begins so all members are aware of what is expected of them, and how to remain respectful.  This can be done through the use of a Team Contract, an agreed upon document that outlines the rules for communication and the consequences of not living up to the agreement.  

Included in this contract there needs to be an agreed upon a way for members to respectfully stop someone who is not living up to their part of the agreement, and redirect the conversation towards the tasks needing to be accomplished.  Anyone in the group should feel comfortable in enforcing the rules of the contract, and ensuring the discussion remains respectful.

While working in a diverse team there may be issues that are difficult to discuss, yet relevant to the task at hand.  If the group avoids the important questions it is important that the team leader address the issues.  He/she may preface their statements by acknowledging that this subject makes you feel a little uncomfortable, but that it needs to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;LaFasto, When Teams Work Best Pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so the topic will get the coverage needed, while bringing the issue to light in a respectful manner.  

Culture and life experiences have a great influence on how individuals react to feedback.   If an open environment is maintained these issues can be brought up and examined in order to best address the individual in a respectful manner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socap.org/other/articles/C204.pdf#search='communication%20in%20a%20diverse%20environment'&lt;/ref&gt; The potential consequences of not respecting the cultural norms can lead to a less effective team atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.doctorholmes.net/Communication.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to best address the issues of diversity it is important that a team sets up a process to allow safe and open communication that can be done in a respectful manner.  A team contract is an excellent way to set up the rules for such discussions, especially when dealing with sensitive issues related to diversity.  Every individual is responsible for their own adherence to the terms of the contract, as well as all group members present.  

== Managing Diversity ==

A team leader must think about diversity as diversity of ideas and experience, not just race and gender. A leader needs to recognize the diversity of each team member and achieve unity of common goals without destroying the uniqueness of any person.  The team leader must do this within the scope of the organization’s resources relative to the growth of the team member. 

Most problems in the work place are not that people cannot do their jobs. Rather it is that people cannot get along with others. The team leader should make efforts in effectively training soft skills. This includes such subjects as diversity, communication and people skills that allow people to understand each other and develop good team skills. Every team member must not only be able to understand and work with all the other team members, but they must also want to. Embracing diversity is the first step to managing a truly diverse team.  In order to facilitate this, team leaders should consider the following:

* Develop an atmosphere in which it is safe for all employees to ask for help. People should not be viewed as weak if they ask for help.  Joining weakness with strengths to get a goal or objective accomplished is one aspect of building great teams. One person’s weakness should be another person’s strength.  
* Actively seek information from people from a variety of backgrounds and cultures in order to develop a broad picture. 
* Include everyone on the problem solving and decision making process. 
* Include people who are different than you in informal gatherings such as lunch, coffee breaks and spur of the moment meetings. 
* Create a team spirit in of which every member feels a part.

A team leader enables the other members to be innovative as well as self-directed within the capacity of individual assignments and allows them to learn from their own, as well as others’ successes, mistakes and failures. It is important to assure that each individual on the team has the opportunity to make the maximum contribution to the success of the team by doing the type of work for which s/he has the greatest opportunity for productivity and achievement.

Leaders have the task of using the other team members’ diverse gifts, abilities, and skills to achieve the common goal without the unintended consequence of conforming to the characteristics the others on the team. This requires active management by the leader to insure that diverse followers show respect and acceptance of the followers that are different in one way or another. 

If team members do not accept others for what they are, they will be unable to use the abilities of each team member to fill in their own weak areas. Hence, the team effort develops knowledge and skill gaps that often lead to failure. Their only goal becomes the ones on their personal agendas while ignoring the needs of the team and the organization. Creating an environment that encourages diversity enables team members to accept every individual on the team and helps them realize that it takes a variety of people to become the best. This kind of environment also enforces the need to rely on everyone within the team, no matter how different another person may be.  These characteristics and experiences make a worker unique. Diversity occurs when the whole team sees all these unique characteristics, and realizes that workers are more valuable because of their differences.

== Stereotyping ==

Stereotypes are beliefs that all members of specific groups share similar traits and are likely to behave in the same way. Stereotypes create categories and then fit individuals into them.  In some respects, this is a useful adaptation to the current environment, but in other cases, conclusions can be made that are detrimental to the understanding of people and to the dynamics of a team.  Individuals never conform to an exact stereotype, given that individual differences outweigh similarities with others in a group, and subsequently, people on a team may use limited personal experience or perceptions of others to guide their interactions.  Stereotypes are based on a variety of qualifications including gender, race, language, finances, religion and sexual preference.

Oftentimes people believe that males in business are good leaders, computer-savvy, unorganized, problem-solvers, etc.  Females are often perceived as organized, record-keepers and relationship-oriented.  In addition, there are some professions that are more stereotypically male and some that are more stereotypically female.  Secretaries are typically thought to be female, as are nurses, flight attendants and often other supportive roles.  Managers, doctors and pilots are typically thought to be male jobs.  If a female is in a position of authority, her actions are often more heavily critiqued as unreasonable or unkind than her male counterpart behaving in the same way.  Managers can avoid this stereotype by providing leadership opportunities to employees of both genders.

Race is another area where stereotyping can easily influence a group dynamic.  Some races are considered high achievers, while other races are labeled as unmotivated.  People of Asian or Indian decent are often seen as hardworking, intelligent, and technical, while people of Polynesian, American Indian and Hispanic decent are often viewed as lazy, unmotivated, and sometimes below average intelligence.  African American workers are sometimes considered confrontational and aggressive in contrast to their Asian peers.  Language barriers can also be a catalyst to stereotyping.  In America, a person who does not yet have a full grasp on the English language is often seen as unintelligent or inferior, when in fact they can be highly trained or skilled workers.  Managers should monitor progress of all team players and concentrate on individual strengths and weaknesses rather than those perceived of the race they belong to.

Stereotyping associated with class differences can create an unsuccessful team dynamic as well.  People in a lower socioeconomic class are often seen as lazy, unintelligent, and unrefined, wheras folks in a higher socioeconomic class are seen as educated, bright, motivated and polite.  People may also be grouped and stereotyped by religion.  Jews are often seen as frugal and business-minded; Muslims are sometimes labeled as extreme.  Catholics may be labeled as traditional, while Evangelicals are seen as progressive.  On a team, these differences can lead to dividing lines.  This may be avoided by assigning tasks to subgroups that cross barriers, allowing people to form working relationships.

Sexual preference can also lead to harmful group stereotyping.  Depending on the industry, gay men or women have more credibility.  Gay men are seen as artistic, fashion-conscious and tasteful, while gay women are taken more seriously than straight women in the mechanical or construction industries.  This is probably a result of more traditionally feminine/masculine traits being exhibited.

These stereotypes are harmful in groups for several reasons.  A person may be misunderstood early in an interaction.  Contributions may be limited and specific strengths or talents may be overlooked because they do not seem prominent in the given stereotypical category.  On the other hand,  poor performance can be overlooked in an individual because they belong to a stereotypically desirable group.  Finally, by allowing stereotypes to govern groups we create natural divisions within the group, where ultimately a common goal should be established.  Managers can combat this by mixing teams, creating smaller mixed teams for subtasks, monitoring all team members’ progress and allowing individuals to volunteer for roles rather than being cast into their default role as defined by their stereotypical category.

== Chapter Review: Atomic &amp; Nuclear Structure ==

* The atom consists of two components - a nucleus (positively charged) and an electron cloud (negatively charged);
* The radius of the nucleus is about 10,000 times smaller than that of the atom;
* The nucleus can have two component particles - '''neutrons''' (no charge) and '''protons''' (positively charged) - collectively called '''nucleons''';
* The mass of a proton is about equal to that of a neutron - and is about 1,840 times that of an electron;
* The number of protons equals the number of electrons in an isolated atom;
* The '''Atomic Number''' specifies the number of protons in a nucleus;
* The '''Mass Number''' specifies the number of nucleons in a nucleus;
* '''Isotopes''' of elements have the same atomic number but different mass numbers;
* Isotopes are classified by specifying the element's chemical symbol preceded by a superscript giving the mass number and a subscript giving the atomic number;
* The '''atomic mass unit''' is defined as 1/12th the mass of the stable, most commonly occurring isotope of carbon (i.e. C-12);
* '''Binding energy''' is the energy which holds the nucleons together in a nucleus and is measured in '''electron volts''' (eV);
* To combat the effect of the increase in electrostatic repulsion as the number of protons increases, the number of neutrons increases more rapidly - giving rise to the '''Nuclear Stability Curve''';
* There are ~2450 isotopes of ~100 elements and the unstable isotopes lie above or below the Nuclear Stability Curve;
* Unstable isotopes attempt to reach the stability curve by splitting into fragments ('''fission''') or by emitting particles/energy ('''radioactivity''');
* Unstable isotopes &lt;=&gt; radioactive isotopes &lt;=&gt; radioisotopes &lt;=&gt; radionuclides;
* ~300 of the ~2450 isotopes are found in nature - the rest are produced artificially.

== Chapter Review: Radioactive Decay ==

* '''Fission''': Some heavy nuclei decay by splitting into 2 or 3 fragments plus some neutrons.  These fragments form new nuclei which are usually radioactive;
* '''Alpha Decay''':  Two protons and two neutrons leave the nucleus together in an assembly known as an '''alpha-particle''';
* An alpha-particle is a He-4 nucleus;
* '''Beta Decay - Electron Emission''':  Certain nuclei with an excess of neutrons may reach stability by converting a neutron into a proton with the emission of a '''beta-minus particle''';
* A beta-minus particle is an electron;
* '''Beta Decay - Positron Emission''':  When the number of protons in a nucleus is in excess, the nucleus may reach stability by converting a proton into a neutron with the emission of a '''beta-plus particle''';
* A beta-plus particle is a '''positron''';
* Positrons '''annihilate''' with electrons to produce two back-to-back gamma-rays;
* '''Beta Decay - Electron Capture''':  An inner orbital electron is attracted into the nucleus where it combines with a proton to form a neutron;
* Electron capture is also known as '''K-capture''';
* Following electron capture, the excited nucleus may give off some gamma-rays.  In addition, as the vacant electron site is filled, an X-ray is emitted;
* '''Gamma Decay - Isomeric Transition''':  A nucleus in an excited state may reach its ground state by the emission of a gamma-ray;
* A gamma-ray is an electromagnetic photon of high energy;
* '''Gamma Decay - Internal Conversion''': the excitation energy of an excited nucleus is given to an atomic electron.

== Chapter Review: The Radioactive Decay Law ==
 
* The radioactive decay law in equation form;   
* Radioactivity is the number of radioactive decays per unit time;
* The '''decay constant''' is defined as the fraction of the initial number of radioactive nuclei which decay in unit time;
* '''Half Life''':  The time taken for the number of radioactive nuclei in the sample to reduce by a factor of two;
* Half Life = (0.693)/(Decay Constant);
* The SI Unit of radioactivity is the '''becquerel''' (Bq) 
* 1 Bq = one radioactive decay per second;
* The traditional unit of radioactivity is the '''curie''' (Ci);
* 1 Ci = 3.7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; radioactive decays per second.

== Chapter Review: Units of Radiation Measurement ==

* '''Exposure''' expresses the intensity of an X- or gamma-ray beam;
* The SI unit of exposure is the '''coulomb per kilogram''' (C/kg);
* 1 C/kg = The quantity of X- or gamma-rays such that the associated electrons emitted per kg of air at STP produce in air ions carrying 1 coulomb of electric charge;
* The traditional unit of exposure is the '''roentgen''' (R);
* 1 R = The quantity of X- or gamma-rays such that the associated  electrons emitted per kg of air at STP produce in air ions carrying 2.58 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; coulombs of electric charge;
* The '''exposure rate''' is the exposure per unit time, e.g. C/kg/s;
* '''Absorbed dose''' is the radiation energy absorbed per unit mass of absorbing material;
* The SI unit of absorbed dose is the '''gray''' (Gy);
* 1 Gy = The absorption of 1 joule of radiation energy per kilogram of material;
* The traditional unit of absorbed dose is the '''rad''';
* 1 rad = The absorption of 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; joules of radiation energy per kilogram of material;
* The '''Specific Gamma-Ray Constant''' expresses the exposure rate produced by the gamma-rays from a radioisotope;
* The Specific Gamma-Ray Constant is expressed in SI units in C/kg/s/Bq at 1 m;
* Exposure from an X- or gamma-ray source follows the '''Inverse Square Law''' and decreases with the square of the distance from the source.

== Chapter Review: Interaction of Radiation with Matter ==

* '''Alpha-Particles''': 
** exert considerable electrostatic attraction on the outer orbital electrons of atoms near which they pass and cause ionisations;
** travel in straight lines - except for rare direct collisions with nuclei of atoms in their path;
** energy is always discrete.
* '''Beta-Minus Particles''': 
** attracted by nuclei and repelled by electron clouds as they pass through matter and cause ionisations;
** have a tortuous path;
** have a range of energies;
** range of energies results because two particles are emitted - a beta-particle and a '''neutrino'''.
* '''Gamma-Rays''': 
** energy is always discrete;
** have many modes of interaction with matter;
** important interactions for nuclear medicine imaging (and radiography) are the Photoelectric Effect and the Compton Effect.
* '''Photoelectric Effect''': 
** when a gamma-ray collides with an orbital electron, it may transfer all its energy to the electron and cease to exist;
** the electron can leave the atom with a kinetic energy equal to the energy of the gamma-ray less the orbital binding energy;
** a positive ion is formed when the electron leaves the atom;
** the electron is called a '''photoelectron''';
** the photoelectron can cause further ionisations;
** subsequent X-ray emission as the orbital vacancy is filled.
* '''Compton Effect''': 
** A gamma-ray may transfer only part of its energy to a valence electron which is essentially free; ** gives rise to a scattered gamma-ray;
** is sometimes called Compton Scatter;
** a positive ion results;
* '''Attenuation''' is term used to describe both absorption and scattering of radiation.

== Chapter Review: Attenuation of Gamma-Rays ==
   
* Attenuation of a narrow-beam of gamma-rays increases as the thickness, the density and the atomic number of the absorber increases;
* Attenuation of a narrow-beam of gamma-rays decreases as the energy of the gamma-rays increases;
* Attenuation of a narrow beam is described by an equation;  
* the '''Linear Attenuation Coefficient''' is defined as the fraction of the incident intensity absorbed in a unit distance of the absorber;
* Linear attenuation coefficients are usually expressed in units of cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;;
* the '''Half Value Layer''' is the thickness of absorber required to reduce the intensity of a radiation beam by a factor of 2;
* Half Value Layer = (0.693)/(Linear Attenuation Coefficient);
* the '''Mass Attenuation Coefficient''' is given by the linear attenuation coefficient divided by the density of the absorber;
* Mass attenuation coefficients are usually expressed in units of cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Chapter Review: Gas-Filled Detectors ==

* Gas-filled detectors include the '''ionisation chamber''', the '''proportional counter''' and the '''Geiger counter''';
* They operate on the basis of ionisation of gas atoms by the incident radiation, where the positive ions and electrons produced are collected by electrodes;
* An '''ion pair''' is the term used to describe a positive ion and an electron;
* The operation of gas-filled detectors is critically dependent on the magnitude of the applied dc voltage;
* The output voltage of an ionisation chamber can be calculated on the basis of the capacitance of the chamber;
* A very sensitive amplifier is required to measure voltage pulses produced by an ionisation chamber;
* The gas in ionisation chambers is usually air;
* Ionisation chambers are typically used to measure radiation exposure (in a device called an '''Exposure Meter''') and radioactivity (in a device called an '''Isotope Calibrator''');
* The total charge collected in a proportional counter may be up to 1000 times the charge produced initially by the radiation;
* The initial ionisation triggers a complete gas breakdown in a Geiger counter;
* The gas in a Geiger counter is usually an inert gas;
* The gas breakdown must be stopped in order to prepare the Geiger counter for a new event by a process called '''quenching''';
* Two types of quenching are possible: electronic quenching and the use of a '''quenching gas''';
* Geiger counters suffer from '''dead time''', a small period of time following the gas breakdown when the counter is inoperative;
* The true count rate can be determined from the actual count rate and the dead time using an equation;
* The value of the applied dc voltage in a Geiger counter is critical, but high stability is not required.

== Chapter Review: Scintillation Detectors ==

* NaI(Tl) is a scintillation crystal widely used in nuclear medicine;
* The crystal is coupled to a '''photomultiplier tube''' to generate a voltage pulse representing the energy deposited in the crystal by the radiation;
* A very sensitive amplifier is needed to measure such voltage pulses;
* The voltages pulses range in amplitude depending on how the radiation interacts with the crystal, i.e. the pulses form a spectrum whose shape depends on the interaction mechanisms involved, e.g. for medium-energy gamma-rays used in in-vivo nuclear medicine: the Compton effect and the Photoelectric effect;
* A '''Gamma-Ray Energy Spectrum''' for a medium-energy, monoenergetic gamma-ray emitter consists (simply) of a Compton Smear and a Photopeak;
* '''Pulse Height Analysis''' is used to discriminate the amplitude of voltage pulses;
* A pulse height analyser (PHA) consists of a '''lower level discriminator''' (which passes voltage pulses which are than its setting) and an '''upper level discriminator''' (which passes voltage pulses lower than its setting);
* The result is a variable width window which can be placed anywhere along a spectrum, or used to scan a spectrum;
* A '''single channel analyser''' (SCA) consists of a single PHA with a scaler and a ratemeter;
* A '''multi-channel analyser''' (MCA) is a computer-controlled device which can acquire data from many windows simultaneously.

== Chapter Review: Nuclear Medicine Imaging Systems ==

* A '''gamma camera''' consists of a large diameter (25-40 cm) NaI(Tl) crystal, ~1 cm thick;
* The crystal is viewed by an array of 37-91 PM tubes;
* PM tubes signals are processed by a position circuit which generates +/- X and +/- Y signals;
* These position signals are summed to form a '''Z signal''' which is fed to a pulse height analyser;
* The +/- X, +/- Y and discriminated Z signals are sent to a computer for digital image processing;
* A '''collimator''' is used to improve the spatial resolution of a gamma-camera;
* Collimators typically consist of a Pb plate containing a large number of small holes;
* The most common type is a '''parallel''' multi-hole collimator;
* The most resolvable area is directly in front of a collimator;
* Parallel-hole collimators vary in terms of the number of holes, the hole diameter, the length of each hole and the septum thickness - the combination of which affect the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the imaging system;
* Other types include the '''diverging'''-hole collimator (which generates minified images), the '''converging'''-hole collimator (which generates magnified images) and the '''pin-hole''' collimator (which generates magnified inverted images);
* Conventional imaging with a gamma camera is referred to as '''Planar Imaging''', i.e. a 2D image portraying a 3D object giving superimposed details and no depth information;
* '''Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography''' (SPECT) produces images of slices through the body;
* SPECT uses a gamma camera to record images at a series of angles around the patient;
* The resultant data can be processed using '''Filtered Back Projection''' and '''Iterative Reconstruction''';
* SPECT gamma-cameras can have one, two or three camera heads;
* '''Positron Emission Tomography''' (PET) also produces images of slices through the body;
* PET exploits the positron annihilation process where two 0.51 MeV back-to-back gamma-rays are produced;
* If these gamma-rays are detected, their origin will lie on a line joining two of the detectors of the ring of detectors which encircles the patient;
* A '''Time-of-Flight''' method can be used to localise their origin;
* PET systems require on-site or nearby '''cyclotron''' to produce short-lived radioisotopes, such as C-11, N-13, O-15 and F-18.

== Chapter Review: Production of Radioisotopes ==

* Naturally-occurring radioisotopes generally have long half lives and belong to relatively heavy elements - and are therefore unsuitable for medical diagnostic applications;
* Medical diagnostic radioisotopes are generally produced artificially;
* The '''fission''' process can be exploited so that radioisotopes of interest can be separated chemically from fission products;
* A '''cyclotron''' can be used to accelerate charged particles up to high energies so that they to collide into a target of the material to be activated;
* A radioisotope generator is generally used in hospitals to produce short-lived radioisotopes;
* A '''technetium-99m generator''' consists of an alumina column containing Mo-99, which decays into Tc-99m;
* Saline is passed through the generator to elute the Tc-99m - the resulting solution is called '''sodium pertechnetate''';
* Both positive pressure and negative pressure generators are in use;
* An '''isotope calibrator''' is needed when a Tc-99m generator is used in order to determine the activity for preparation of patient doses and to test whether any Mo-99 is present in the collected solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction to the sonnets==
=== The Youth and the Lady ===
The author's sonnets are written for two subjects: a young man, and the narrator's beloved.  In the first of these cases, the narrator advises his young follower on how to attract women, while simultaneously declaring his own affection for the young lad.  Modern scholars have claimed that their relationship borders on pederasty.  However, none of his sonnets have directly declared this intent.

=== Sonnet structure ===
Before the arrival of Shakespeare, most poets followed the form of what is known as the Petrarchan sonnet:

A&lt;br /&gt;
B&lt;br /&gt;
B&lt;br /&gt;
A&lt;br /&gt;
A&lt;br /&gt;
B&lt;br /&gt;
B&lt;br /&gt;
A&lt;br /&gt;
C&lt;br /&gt;
D&lt;br /&gt;
E&lt;br /&gt;
C&lt;br /&gt;
D&lt;br /&gt;
E

The last six lines could either come in the above form (C-D-E-C-D-E) or in the form of (C-D-C-C-D-C).  This was the standard form for nearly three hundred years.  However, Shakespeare revolutionized the sonnet with the creation of his own form, which would soon bear his name: 

A&lt;br /&gt;
B&lt;br /&gt;
A&lt;br /&gt;
B&lt;br /&gt;
C&lt;br /&gt;
D&lt;br /&gt;
C&lt;br /&gt;
D&lt;br /&gt;
E&lt;br /&gt;
F&lt;br /&gt;
E&lt;br /&gt;
F&lt;br /&gt;
G&lt;br /&gt;
G

      <text xml:space="preserve">You have been &quot;dumping&quot; (to use your own phraseology) some pages on ''The Complete Peanuts Annotations'' that were previously on Wikipedia. Wikibooks is, however, for textbooks, and the pages you have added do not appear to be textbooks. I will leave things a short while to give you a chance to put me right if I have misunderstood the situation, otherwise these pages will be deleted shortly, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:41, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

:I'm afraid what you've been told at Wikipedia is wrong. Wikibooks is a separate Wikimedia project. This means we are independent of Wikipedia, and Wikipedia is independent of us, although there are, of course, many linkages and similarities as you'd expect of sister projects. Just as Wikipedia has its own inclusion criteria, so Wikibooks has its own inclusion criteria too - and it does not follow that just because something does not meet Wikipedia's inclusion criteria it must necessarily meet the inclusion criteria of another Wikimedia project.

:Wikibooks' inclusion criteria is for textbooks. This can include annotated texts if they are suitable for study of the books as part of, say, a course in English Literature. But they ought to have the feel of a textbook, rather than just be a series of what are essentially footnotes. It is somewhat unfortunate that many Wikipedians are unaware of our inclusion criteria and therefore end up making misleading suggestions where there is book like material added to Wikipedia which is outside its scope.

:On the face of it, your additions are not those of a textbook. Now, it may be your intention to develop these pages further so that they are part of a textbook - in which case there would be no objection to them staying here and forming part of that textbook. However, if that is not your intention, then the content unfortunately does not belong here and will therefore be deleted. All the best, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:51, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

OK. Good luck in finding a suitable home for it. Incidentally, I think the best &quot;annotated text&quot; we have is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]]. If you ever are thinking of providing an annotated text textbook, that would be a good guide to follow. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:05, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">When a plane has been constructed or assembled, it needs to be balanced before you fly it.  It should not be nose or tail heavy.  With the plane fully assembled but with no fuel in the tank, pick the plane up by the wing tips and ensure it does not tip forward or backwards.   

Many planes identify their center of gravity position.  This is the position on the wings where the balance point should be measured from.  If the balance point is not identified in the build manual or on the plan sheet, a general rule-of-thumb is to balance the plane 25% of the &quot;mean aerodynamic chord&quot; (the average distance from the leading edge to the trailing edge - usually the thickest part of the wing).

If the plane is not balanced properly, there are a number of options.  Firstly, if the location of the wing can be moved forward or backwards, that is usually a good idea.  If the plane tips forward, move the wing forward.  If the plane tips towards the tail, move the wing towards the tail.  Basically move the wing in the heavy direction.

For planes which use wooden dowels placed through the fuselage and elastic bands to hold the wing on, a suggested way to find the location where the dowels should be placed is to place them temporarily under the fuselage and used an elastic band from one side of the dowel to the other over the top of the fuselage.   With the two dowels strapped on in this fashion, the wing can then be attached in the manner that it will eventually be attached in flight.  The dowels (and the wing) can then be slid forwards or backwards until a good balancing location is reached.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Coroplast=
Coroplast is used in the making of plastic signs. In much of the SPAD world, coroplast is usually shortened to &quot;coro&quot;.

Coro is the plastic equivalent of corrugated cardboard.  It consists of two parallel plastic sheets with vertical spars between them.  The channels created by these spars are termed 'flutes'.  When working with coro, always ensure that you are thinking about the direction in which the flutes travel.

Coro usually comes in two varieties of thickness.
*4mm 
*2mm 

The 4mm seems to be more prevalent than the 2mm.

===Cutting Coroplast===
Coro can be cut using a sharp knife such as a new bladed box cutter.  It is strongly recommended that a guide be used to ensure that the blade does not deviate from any desired straight line.  Making a few scores with the blade rather than a single deep cut seems to give the best results and best accuracy.

Cutting in the same direction as the flutes is easiest, cutting against the direction of the flutes is also not that difficult.  Cutting with the flutes can be easily done with a hand held flute knife such as a Coro-Claw.  The most challenging direction is one that is neither parallel or perpendicular to the flutes but rather at an angle.  The texture of the cut keeps changing.  Slow and steady seems to offer the best results.

===Flashing Coroplast===
In order to glue one piece of Coro to another, CA glue may be used. Unfortunately, it is not enough just to apply some glue to the parts to be bonded. By nature, the plastic used for making Coro does not bond well unless its surface is first &quot;activated&quot;. A common technique for achieving this is called 'flashing'. This involves passing a flame over the surface for just a moment, being careful not to melt the surface. A hand-held torch seems to work well for this task and can be purchased for under $15 from your local hardware store. Test your technique on a scrap piece first. Water should not form droplets, but a thin film on properly activated Coro.

===Pinning Coroplast===
The flutes of Coroplast can be attached to make a column or free standing sign by using a Coro Pin.  The pin acts as a huge bobby pin and goes in the flutes of two sides of Coroplast to attach them.

===Suppliers===
* [http://www.regal-plastics.com/ Regal Plastics] - Retail supplier in TX, OK and LA. 

===References===
* [http://www.coroplast.com/ Coroplast home page] - The makers of Coroplast.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yardsticks are used as the spars/struts in the interior of wings. When choosing yardsticks, try and find ones which are as straight as possible. Also pay attention to the direction of the grain of the wood. Ideally it should be along the short direction (up and down if the stick is on its edge).

Yardsticks can be found at home improvement/DIY stores.
* ACE Hardware 

Some stores that apparently do not carry yardsticks include:
* Lowe's

      <text xml:space="preserve">Wooden dowels of about 1/4&quot; in diameter make great anchors for elastic bands used to strap the wings in place.

On occasion, it can be found that the location of the dowel to achieve a good CG would place it straight through the fuel bottle or some other central component.  A solution to this is to use wire on the underside of the plane.

This picture illustrates coat hanger wire bent appropriately:

Here is an example of the wire being used to hold down the elastic bands to hold the plane to the wing:

'''Tomatoes''' are in many regions among the most popular fruits grown in gardens, because with most varieties freshness is a major factor in the quality of harvested fruit.

==Growing Conditions==
Tomato plants need acidic (5.0 to 6.0 pH) soil, a balance between the three primary fertilizer nutrients, and thrive in warm weather. Inexpensive ways to naturally increase soil acidity include using pine needles as mulch, and mixing either used coffee grounds or sawdust into the soil. Pine needles (and the soil under pine trees) are very acidic, and though used coffee grounds are not very acidic, they and sawdust cause a chemical change in the soil, lowering its pH. Fresh coffee grounds or a 4:1 solution of water and coffee can be used for a quick, direct boost in acidity.  Tomatoes do not need high calcium content in order to produce good fruits.

In temperate climates, tomatoes are generally started from seed indoors, then planted out after the last frost date. Tomatoes are planted deeply in the soil, often burying the plant up to just below its top set of leaves, as it roots freely off the stem. If staked, trellised, or caged (methods of supporting the weight of vining plants, allowing them to devote more energy into growing fruit), tomato plants can be grown much closer together than the three feet usually recommended. 

While tomato plants do best with eight or more hours of direct sunlight, they may do better if shaded during noontime sun if the temperature is above ninety degrees. Some gardeners will actually throw fine cloth over the plants around noon on very hot days.
Indeterminate plants require at least twenty gallons of soil in order to grow in a container; it's better to use determinate varieties for containers, instead.

In each tomato plant, there are about 2 to 3kg when the tomato plant has finished growing. Tomatoes tend to grow faster and produce more fruit when companion planting. Marigolds repel aphids and grow well with tomatoes, and Basil both repels insects (even mosquitoes) and improves fruit flavor. Other companion plants for tomatoes are asparagus, onion/garlic/chives, nasturtium, rose, and parsley. Tomato plants are themselves good companion plants for chili peppers, helping shade their fruit.

==Uses==


==Maintenance==
===Early Spring===
Tomatoes grow best in a deep, rich soil, so preparing the bed for this is key. 

Seeds are usually planted indoors 4-8 weeks before the last frost date.

Trellising or cages should be put in before the tomatoes are planted.

===Summer===
Consistent irrigation is key, because inconsistent irrigation can lead to cracking. Irrigation should be to the soil, rather than using sprinklers.

===Fall Cleanup===
Just before the first frost, it's a good idea to pick the last green tomatoes (which can be used in many recipes), as they can be damaged by cold. All vines should be removed from the field (roots and all) to help manage any disease organisms. Seeds will sprout in cold compost piles, so heat composting should be used if possible. be sure to make clean as possible.

==Propagation==
Tomatoes are almost always propagated by seed but some success has been had with stem cuttings.

==Grafting&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~clrivard/TubeGraftingTechnique.pdf Tube Grafting Technique, Richard and Louws, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;==

'''Tube grafting''' should be carried out when the seedlings have two to four [[w:true leaves]] and the stems are 1.5 to 2 millimeters in [[w:diameter]] (Figure 3). For proper healing to take place, the vascular tissue in the rootstock and scion must align so that their tissues can easily grow together, forming a strong union for water and nutrient uptake. Again, an essential component for grafting success is to use rootstock and scion plants that have similar stem diameters. Grafting should take place when there is little water stress upon the plants. Early in the morning or just after dark are excellent times to graft as transpiration has typically slowed to reduced levels. Additionally, the grafting process should be carried out indoors or under some sort of shading device. If daytime grafting is essential due to timing and labor concerns, move the plants to a shady area in the morning before [[w:transpiration]] increases to prevent unwanted water stress during the process.
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:clips.jpg|2.0 mm grafting clips (Rivard and Louws, 2006)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Make the grafts'''
[[w:Sanitation]] is extremely important during grafting. Wash with anti-microbial soap, and use latex gloves and [[w:Asepsis|sterile]] tools to reduce the exposure of the plant to pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses. To make a graft, sever the bottom half of a rootstock seedling from its top at a 45-degree angle, and sever the top half of a scion seedling from its bottom at a 45-degree angle. Attach the rootstock to the scion with a rubber or silicon clip (Figure 4). Although the specific degree of each angular cut does not have to be exact, all cuts should be made at a consistent angle to provide more surface area for the vascular tissue to meet and grow together. Other methods have attempted to increase this surface area even further by making V-shaped cuts, but the results are similar to those of the tube grafting technique. Locate the graft union above the cotyledon to prevent adventitious roots from forming and leading to infection of the susceptible scion tissue.  Once the transplants have been grafted, put them directly into the healing chamber and cover the chamber to prevent any light from reaching the plants.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Monitor the healing process'''
Immediately after grafting takes place, the plants must form callus tissue and reconnect vascular bundles to provide the scion with nutrients and water. The purpose of the healing chamber is to keep the scion from becoming water stressed during this process. This can be accomplished by slowing the transpiration stream—the movement of water from inside the plant tissue into the atmosphere. The best ways to do this are to increase humidity, decrease light, and decrease temperature. By decreasing the temperature, however, the development of newly forming callus tissue may be hindered. Therefore, the keys to successful chamber operation are high humidity and no direct sunlight while the graft union is developing—between two and four days after making the graft.  The first major constraint to proper graft healing is water stress. Because the scions have been physically separated from their root systems, they tend to wilt, especially in the first few hours after grafting. By adjusting environmental conditions to keep the scions from wilting severely, the grafts will have a better chance of survival. Typically, a small amount of wilt during the first day of healing is acceptable. The high humidity level inside the healing chamber will help the scions regain sufficient turgor pressure and show little sign of wilting. Grafts should be left in the chamber for the first two to four days with absolutely no light and high humidity. After these first days, the successful grafts will become apparent as they will regain normal turgor levels while those that were not successful will wilt permanently. Any movement that pulls the scion stem away from the rootstock will decrease the contact surface between these tissues, ultimately diminishing graft success. Place the grafts into the chamber carefully. Inspect the grafts after placing them in the chamber to be sure that the scion has not been pulled away from the rootstock. Excess water on the leaves can also physically pull the scion away from the rootstock. For this reason, do not mist grafts once they are in the chamber. While the grafts are still weak and healing, apply water from the bottom so that the grafts are not subjected to damage from overhead irrigation.
&lt;gallery&gt;

Image:PA_chamber.jpg|Commercial healing chamber
&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Acclimate the grafts to normal conditions'''
Throughout the healing process, open the chamber at least twice a day to replenish carbon dioxide for the grafts. After two to four days in the healing chamber with absolutely no light and high humidity, the scions should return to normal turgor levels and display no evidence of moisture stress. Once the grafts reach normal turgor levels, light can be slowly introduced, and eventually humidity levels can be reduced over the following week. There is a danger that this process can be carried out too fast. When light is first introduced back into the chamber, it is best to simulate indirect light. If the chamber is indoors, mount fluorescent lights above the chamber. In the greenhouse, use a shading apparatus that will significantly reduce the amount of sunlight without eliminating it altogether. As soon as the transplants have acclimated to the reduced light level with no signs of stress, gradually decrease humidity by removing pans of water or the cool-water vaporizer and lifting up the sides of the chamber. Typically, the grafts will require two days at medium light and humidity levels before they can be moved into a low-humidity and high-light environment. Even after the plants have been moved out of the chamber and into a standard greenhouse environment, it is best to water from the bottom to prevent any physical damage to the grafts while the graft union is still weak. Careful overhead watering is possible as long as the seedlings are not exposed to high water pressure that could separate a scion from its rootstock.
As the grafted transplants develop, the grafting clip will expand with the growing stem, and eventually fall off (Figure 7). Once the grafted transplants have been in the greenhouse for five to seven days, they can be managed and planted in the field or greenhouse similarly to non-grafted transplants. It is important that grafted tomatoes be planted in the soil in a way that prevents adventitious roots from allowing a bridge to susceptible scion tissue. Therefore, they should be planted so that the graft union is well above the soil line to prevent scion-borne adventitious roots from forming.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Harvesting==
Tomatoes should be harvested as soon as ripe. Most varieties will continue to ripen once picked. 

Many varieties have delicate fruits, and should not be stacked too high in the basket.

==Pests and Diseases==
Tomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease. Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants. One common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus. Various forms of mildew and blight are also common tomato afflictions, which is why tomato varieties are usually marked with letters like VFN, which refers to disease resistance to verticillium wilt, fusarium fungus, and nematodes.

Some common tomato pests are cutworms, tomato hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, and Colorado potato beetles and moth lava.

Transplanted tomatoes may begin to show yellow leaves at the base. According to hothouse tomato pioneer, Dan Busch, &quot;With your leaves turning yellow, the tomato plant needs to be fertilized. The fertilizer that you need to use needs to be well balanced, meaning 20-20-20, and if you do not want to use this kind of fertilizer, use blood meal and fish emulsions. This will give you a good source of nitrogen, then you will need to add phosphorus (rock phosphate or super phosphate). Slow growing plants are a sure sign of low phosphorus. Be sure to read the instructions on the blood meal and fish emulsion because it is easy to over fertilize. The real issue here is the nutrition. The yellowing of the leaves is not uncommon with a new transplant, because any nutrition is gone by the time you take it home. If the plants are weak, this is an indication of low potassium. To get potassium in the soil you can add granite dust or wood ash. Call around to local garden centers to find these items.

===Fungal Diseases===

===Viral diseases===
:*[[w:Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)]]

===Arthropod Pests===
To prevent cutworms, tomato seedlings' most vicious predators, one can place an open-ended can so that it surrounds the plant, or wrap it with something like foil or paper, or simply brace its stem with popsicle sticks or toothpicks, all of which seem to deter this moth larva from wrapping around and cutting off the baby plant at its base or leaves.

===Vertebrate Pests===
Birds occasionally damage fruits by pecking. Chipmunks and rats may eat whole fruits.

White tail deer can be a serious problem in North America.

==Troubleshooting==
===Yellow leaves on transplants===
Transplanted tomatoes may begin to show yellow leaves at the base. According to hothouse tomato pioneer, Dan Busch,
&quot;With your leaves turning yellow, the tomato plant needs to be fertilized. The fertilizer that you need to use needs to be well balanced, meaning 20-20-20, and if you do not want to use this kind of fertilizer, use blood meal and fish emulsions. This will give you a good source of nitrogen, then you will need to add phosphorus (rock phosphate or super phosphate). Slow growing plants is a sure sign of low phosphorus.

To get potassium in the soil you can add granite dust or wood ash. Call around to local garden centers to find these items.

Yellowing leaves can also be caused by either magnesium or sulfur deficiency, both of which can be treated by adding dissolved [[w:epsom salt]] or other forms of [[w:magnesium sulfate]] to the soil, and [[w:foliar feed]]ing the plant with a mixture of two tablespoons epsom salts per gallon. Foliar treatment is reputed to work within 48 hours, but the soil does also need to be amended as a long-term fix.

[[Image:Tomates anciennes.jpg|thumb|A selection of tomato cultivars showing the variation in shape and color available]]
The tomato is now grown world-wide for its edible [[fruit]]s, with thousands of [[cultivar]]s having been selected with varying fruit types, and for optimum growth in differing growing conditions. Cultivated tomatoes vary in size from [[cherry tomato]]es, about the same 1-2 cm size as the wild tomato, up to 'beefsteak' tomatoes 10 cm or more in diameter. The most widely grown commercial tomatoes tend to be in the 5-6 cm diameter range. Most cultivars produce red fruit, but a number of cultivars with yellow, orange, pink, purple, green, or white fruit are also available. Multicolored and striped fruit can also be quite striking. Tomatoes grown for [[canning]] are often elongated, 7-9 cm long and 4-5 cm diameter; these are known as [[plum tomato]]es.

Tomatoes are one of the most common garden vegetables in the United States, and along with [[zucchini]] have a reputation for outproducing the needs of the grower. 

As in most sectors of agriculture, there is increasing demand in developed countries for [[organic farming|organic]] tomatoes, as well as [[Heirloom_tomato|heirloom tomatoes]] to make up for flavor and texture faults in commercial tomatoes. Quite a few seed merchants and banks provide a large selection of heirloom seeds. Tomato seeds are occasionally organically produced as well, but only a small percentage of organic crop acreage is grown with organic seed.

=== Growing needs ===   

Tomato plants can be easy to grow, producing a significant amount of fruit for a small amount of work, which is perhaps why 80% of American gardens include some kind of tomato. They can be raised from seeds by planting indoors eight weeks before it will be warm enough to plant outside, or they can be planted as purchased seedlings directly in the ground.    
   
Tomato plants need acidic (5.0 to 6.0 pH) soil, a balance between the three primary fertilizer nutrients, and thrive in warm weather. Inexpensive ways to naturally increase soil acidity include using pine needles as mulch, and mixing either used coffee grounds or sawdust into the soil. Pine needles (and the soil under pine trees) are very acidic, and though used coffee grounds are not very acidic, they and sawdust cause a chemical change in the soil, lowering its pH. Fresh coffee grounds, or a 4:1 dilution of water:coffee, can be used for a quick, direct acidity boost.
   
To prevent [[cutworm]]s, tomato seedlings' most vicious predators, one can place an open-ended can so that it surrounds the plant, or wrap it with something like foil or paper, or simply brace its stem with popsicle sticks or toothpicks, all of which seem to deter this moth larva from wrapping around and cutting off the baby plant at its base or leaves.   
   
Tomato plants can be grown much closer together than the standard 3' apart, if staked, [[trellis]]ed, or caged, all of which are methods of holding up vining plants to allow them to put more energy into growing fruit. Recent, peer-reviewed science suggests that red plastic mulch (sheets of plastic, dyed specific colors which reflect red and higher frequencies of light) increase fruit production by as much as 20%.{{citation needed
}}
   
While tomato plants do best with eight or more hours of direct sunlight, they may do better if shaded during noontime sun if the temperature is above ninety degrees. Some gardeners will actually throw fine cloth over the plants around noon on very hot days.
   
Indeterminate plants require at least twenty gallons of soil in order to grow in a container; it's better to use determinate varieties for containers, instead.   
   
Tomatoes tend to grow faster and produce more fruit when [[companion planting]]. [[Marigold]]s repel [[aphid]]s and grow well with tomatos, and [[Basil]] both repels insects (even mosquitos) and improves fruit flavor. Other companion plants for tomatoes are [[asparagus]], [[onion]]/[[garlic]]/[[chives]], [[nasturtium]], [[rose]], and [[parsley]]. Tomato plants are, themselves, good companion plants for [[chili peppers]], helping shade their fruit.

===Varieties and cultivars===
[[Image:Tomatplanta.JPG|thumb|left|Young tomato plant]]There are a great many tomato varieties grown for various purposes. This section attempts a listing of some of the more common varieties. [[Heirloom_tomato|Heirloom]] varieties are becoming increasingly popular, particularly among home gardeners and organic producers, since they tend to produce more interesting and flavorful crops at the possible cost of some disease resistance. Hybrid plants remain common, however, since they tend to be heavier producers and sometimes combine unusual characteristics of heirloom tomatoes with the ruggedness of conventional commercial tomatoes. 

Tomato varieties are roughly divided into several categories, based mostly on shape and size. &quot;Slicing&quot; or &quot;globe&quot; tomatoes are the usual tomatoes of commerce; [[beefsteak tomato]]es are large tomatoes often used for sandwiches and similar applications; [[plum tomato]]es or paste tomatoes are bred with a higher solid content for use in [[tomato sauce]] and [[tomato paste|paste]]; and [[cherry tomato]]es are small, often sweet tomatoes generally eaten whole in salads. 

Tomatoes are also commonly classified as determinate or indeterminate. Determinate, or bush, types bear a full crop all at once and top off at a specific height; they are often good choices for container growing. Indeterminate varieties develop into vines that never top off and continue producing until killed by frost. As an intermediate ground, there are plants sometimes known as &quot;vigorous determinate&quot; or &quot;semi-determinate&quot;; these top off like determinates but produce a second crop after the initial crop. Many, if not all, tomatoes described as heirlooms are indeterminate.

Commonly grown varieties include:

*Beefsteak VFN (a common hybrid resistant to [[Verticillium]], [[Fusarium]], and [[Nematode]]s)
*Big Boy (a very common determinate garden cultivar in the United States)
*Black Krim (a purple-and-red variety from the [[Crimea]])
*Brandywine (a pink, indeterminate beefsteak type with a considerable number of substrains)
*[[W. Atlee Burpee|Burpee]] VF (an early attempt at disease resistance in a commercial tomato)
*Early Girl (an early-maturing globe type)
*Gardener's Delight (a smaller English variety)
*Juliet (a grape tomato developed as a substitute for the rare Santa F1)
*Marmande (a heavily ridged variety from southern France; similar to a small beefsteak and available commercially in the US as [[UglyRipe]])
*Moneymaker (an English greenhouse variety)
*Mortgage Lifter (a popular heirloom beefsteak known for gigantic fruit)
*Patio (bred specifically for container gardens)
*Roma VF (a [[plum tomato]] common in supermarkets)
*Rutgers (an heirloom commercial variety)
*San Marzano (a plum tomato popular in Italy)
*Santa F1 (a closely guarded [[China|Chinese]] [[grape tomato]] cultivar popular in the USA and parts of southeast Asia)
*Sweet 100 (a very prolific, indeterminate cherry tomato)
*Yellow Pear (a yellow, pear-shaped heirloom variety)

Most modern tomato varieties are smooth-surfaced, but older tomato cultivars (and some modern beefsteaks) often show pronounced ribbing, a feature that may have been common to virtually all precolumbian varieties. In addition, tomatoes come in colors other than red, including yellow, orange, pink and purple, though such tomatoes are not widely available in markets. 

There is also a considerable gap between commercial and home gardener varieties; home varieties are often bred for flavor to the exclusion of all other qualities, while commercial varieties are bred for such factors as consistent size and shape, disease and pest resistance, and suitability for mechanized picking and shipping.

===Diseases and pests===
Tomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease.  Modern [[hybrid]]s focus on improving disease resistance over the [[heirloom plant]]s.  One common tomato disease is [[tobacco mosaic virus]], and for this reason smoking or use of [[tobacco]] products should be avoided around tomatoes{{citation needed}}.  Various forms of [[mildew]] and [[blight]] are also common tomato afflictions, which is why tomato varieties are usually marked with letters like [[VFN]], which refers to disease resistance to ''[[verticillium]]'' [[wilt]]. ''[[fusarium]]'' [[fungus]], and [[nematode]]s.

Some common tomato pests are [[cutworms]], [[tomato hornworm]]s, [[aphid]]s, [[cabbage looper]]s, [[whitefly|whiteflies]], [[tomato fruitworm]]s, [[flea beetle]]s, and [[Colorado potato beetle]]s.

Transplanted tomatoes may begin to show yellow leaves at the base. According to hothouse tomato pioneer, Dan Busch,
&quot;With your leaves turning yellow, the tomato plant needs to be fertilized. The fertilizer that you need to use needs to be well balanced, meaning 20-20-20, and if you do not want to use this kind of fertilizer, use blood meal and fish emulsions. This will give you a good source of nitrogen, then you will need to add phosphorus (rock phosphate or super phosphate). Slow growing plants is a sure sign of low phosphorus. Be sure to read the instructions on the blood meal and fish emulsion because it is easy to over fertilize. The real issue here is the nutrition. The yellowing of the leaves is not uncommon with a new transplant, because any nutrition is gone by the time you take it home. If the plants are weak, this is an indication of low potassium. To get potassium in the soil you can add granite dust or wood ash. Call around to local garden centers to find these items.

===Pollination===
[[Image:Tomato scanned.jpg|thumb|left|The flower and leaves are visible in this scan of a tomato plant.]]
In the wild, original state, tomatoes required cross [[pollination]]; they were much more [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self incompatible]] than domestic cultivars. As a floral device to reduce selfing, the [[pistil]]s of wild varieties extended farther out of the flower than today's varieties. The [[stamen]]s were, and remain, entirely within the closed [[Petal|corolla]].

As tomatoes were moved from their native areas, their traditional [[pollinator]]s, (probably a species of [[halictidae|halictid]] [[bee]]) did not move with them. The trait of self fertilility (or self [[pollenizer|pollenizing]]) became an advantage and domestic [[cultivar]]s of tomato have been selected to maximize this trait.
This is not the same as self-pollination, despite the common claim that tomatoes do so. That tomatoes pollinate themselves poorly without outside aid is clearly shown in [[greenhouse]] situations where pollination must be aided by artificial wind, vibration of the plants (one brand of vibrator is a wand called an &quot;electric bee&quot; that is used manually), or more often today, by cultured [[bumblebee]]s.

The [[anther]] of a tomato flower is shaped like a hollow tube, with the [[pollen]] produced within the structure rather than on the surface, as with most species. The pollen moves through pores in the anther, but very little pollen is shed without some kind of outside motion.

The best source of outside motion is a [[buzz pollination|sonicating]] bee such as a bumblebee or the original wild halictid pollinator. In an outside setting, wind or biological agents provide sufficient motion to produce commercially viable crops.

===Hydroponic and greenhouse cultivation===
Tomatoes are often grown in [[greenhouse]]s in cooler climates, and indeed there are varieties such as the British &quot;Moneymaker&quot; and a number of cultivars grown in [[Siberia]] that are specifically bred for indoor growing. In more temperate climates it is not uncommon to start seeds for future transplant in greenhouses during the late winter as well.

[[Hydroponic]] tomatoes are also available, and the technique is often used in hostile growing environments as well as high-density plantings.

===Picking and ripening===
[[Image:Tomato slices.jpg|thumb|right|Tomato slices]]
Tomatoes are often picked unripe (which are colored green at the time), and ripened in storage with [[ethylene]]. Ethylene is the plant hormone produced by many fruits and acts as the cue to begin the ripening process. These tend to keep longer, but have poorer flavor and a mealier, starchier texture than tomatoes ripened on the plant. They may be recognized by their color, which is more pink or orange than the ripe tomato's deep red. 

In [[1994]], [[Calgene]] introduced a [[Transgenic plants|genetically modified]] tomato called the [[FlavrSavr]] which could be vine ripened without compromising shelf-life. However, the product was not commercially sucessful (''see main article for details'') and was only sold until [[1997]].

Recently, stores have begun selling &quot;tomatoes on the vine&quot; which are ripened still connected to a piece of vine. These tend to have more flavor (at a price premium) than artificially-ripened tomatoes, but still may not be the equal of local garden produce. 

Also relatively recently, slow-ripening cultivars of tomato have been developed by crossing a non-ripening variety with ordinary tomato cultivars. Cultivars were selected whose fruits have a long shelf life and at least reasonable flavor. These have been nicknamed &quot;Thrushworthy Bumbletots,&quot; as the name of them is the name of the machine system(s) used to clean the tomatoes before processing to be canned or shipped. The name is an example of [[onomatopoeia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A mass air flow sensor is usually mounted to the intake manifold or intake tube after the filter. It records and measure the amount of air and the temperature of air entering the Intake manifold. The MAF sensor sends that data to the Engine Computer, wich in turn, decides how much fuel to send into the combustion chamber, to create a good Fuel/Air mixtuer.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, 

just a few words about myself: 

I'm German, and want to contribute to this wikibook by adding some sound files. I'm a native German speaker and will try to speak slow and clear, that everyone can understand and repeat the exercises. 

Some private informations: 
Currently, I'm 34 years old, live in the south west of Germany, close to the French border and I'm studying microsystems technology. 

If you want to know more, please ask :)

The '''Eccentric Elmer''' is a relatively smooth bourbon cocktail, sweet with a hint of bitterness.  Note that it is important to use cranberry ''cocktail'', not cranberry ''juice''.  If cranberry cocktail is not available in your area, substitute cranberry juice and add 1 tbsp of superfine sugar to the drink before shaking.
==Ingredients==
* 1 oz bourbon
* 1/2 oz triple sec
* 3 oz cranberry cocktail
* dash angostura bitters
Garnishes
* Lime wedge
==Glass==
* Old-fashioned
==Procedure==
# Fill a cocktail shaker halfway with ice.
# Add bourbon, triple sec, bitters, and cranberry cocktail to shaker.
# Shake well.
# Put a few ice cubes into an old-fashioned glass.
# Strain cocktail into glass.
# Garnish with lime wedge.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Briefly, a tangent is a derivative of a curve. Translated into topology this means that you can effectively remove one dimension from a picture. Typically, when working with space time we can can perform one of two operations: Either remove time as a way to see frozen 3D images or we can remove one spatial dimension and therefore represent space time as a curved surface (the net like drawings so typically used to represent topological surfaces in pictures or such phenomena as black holes which are often drawn as shrinking cones).

Tangent spaces are therefore only a representation of what we understand to be one dimension simpler than the problems of topology. It is a useful tool for visualising space time arguments and positions.

== Euclidean prelude ==

So far we have defined smooth maps on smooth manifolds by requiring the corresponding maps on euclidean space to be smooth. In this section we will generalize the notion of derivative on euclidean space to a notion of the derivative of functions between manifolds.


Recall our definition of the derivative on euclidean space:

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, \mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, if it exists, is a linear map &lt;math&gt;Df(p)\,:\,\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(p+h)-f(p)-Df(p)h}{||h||}=0&lt;/math&gt;


'''Remark 2:''' &lt;math&gt;Df(p)&lt;/math&gt; is unique if it exists, and can be identified with the jacobian matrix &lt;math&gt;\left[ \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} \right]_{n\times m}&lt;/math&gt;. This is left as an exercise to the reader. This way of defining the derivative does nt, unfortunately, lend itself to generalization to the manifold level. Instead, we will construct another definition of the derivative on euclidean space.


'''Definition 3:''' A ''smooth curve'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is a smooth function &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,:\, \mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma,\delta&lt;/math&gt; be smooth curves on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0)=\delta(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Define the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\gamma\sim\delta\,\Leftrightarrow\, \gamma^\prime (0)=\delta^\prime (0)&lt;/math&gt;. Define the ''tangent space'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; as the space &lt;math&gt;T_p\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; of all equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;[\gamma]&lt;/math&gt; of smooth curves &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0)=p&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 4:''' Note that we only need smooth curves to be defined on an open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 5:''' &lt;math&gt;T_p\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; as a vector space for any &lt;math&gt;p\in \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since for any smooth curve &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma^\prime(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural bijection &lt;math&gt;[\gamma]\mapsto \gamma^\prime(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be this bijection, and give &lt;math&gt;T_p\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; the vector space structure &lt;math&gt;a[\gamma] + b[\delta]=\mu^{-1}\left(a\mu([\gamma])+b\mu([\delta]) \right)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; becomes an isomorphism of vector spaces. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Remark 6:''' Unlike &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_p\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; does not have a natural basis.


'''Lemma 7:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth curve on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0)=p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma^\prime(0)=v&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\gamma\sim \delta&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\delta(t)=p+vt&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': First off, note that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0)=p=\delta(0)&lt;/math&gt;, so it makes sense to compare them. Secondly, &lt;math&gt;\delta^\prime(0)=v=\gamma^\prime(0)&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\gamma\sim\delta&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\,\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth function. Then the ''differential'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the map &lt;math&gt;d_pf\,:\,T_p\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow T_{f(p)}\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;d_pf([\gamma])=[f\circ \gamma]&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 9:''' &lt;math&gt;d_pf&lt;/math&gt; is well defined.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma\sim\delta&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0)=p=\delta(0)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(f\circ \gamma)^\prime (0)=Df(\gamma(0))\gamma^\prime(0)=Df(\delta(0))\delta^\prime(0)=(f\circ \delta)^\prime(0)&lt;/math&gt; by the chain rule and using the usual derivative, therefore &lt;math&gt;[f\circ \gamma]=[f\circ\delta]&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;d_pf&lt;/math&gt; is well defined. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;f(p)=g(p)&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;Df(p)=D(g)(p)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;d_pf=d_pg&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof:'' Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be any curve at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;Df(p)=Dg(p)&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;d_pf([\gamma])=[f\circ \gamma]=[f(p)+Df(p)\gamma^\prime(0)t]=[g(p)+Dg(p)\gamma^\prime(0)t]=[g\circ \gamma]=d_pg([\gamma])&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


Thus the differenital encodes the information about the derivative. However, it also encodes information about &lt;math&gt;f(p)&lt;/math&gt;. Unlike the previous definition of the derivative, the differential ''can'', with some slight modifications, be generalized to work on manifolds. That is the topic of the next subsection.


== Tangent Spaces ==

'''Definition 11:''' A ''smooth curve'' on a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a function &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,:\,\mathbb{R}\rightarrow M&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma(0)=p&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\gamma,\delta&lt;/math&gt; are smooth curves on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, we define the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\gamma\sim\delta&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a chart &lt;math&gt;(U,\phi)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p\in U&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(\phi\circ\gamma)^\prime(0)=(\phi\circ\delta)^\prime(0)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 12:''' We can differentiate &lt;math&gt;(\phi\circ\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; since it is a function between euclidean spaces, for which we already have a developed theory of differentiation. Also, the equivalence relation is well defined since if it holds for one chart, it holds for all compatible charts as well.


'''Definition 13:''' The ''tangent space'' of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the space of all equivalence classes of curves on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
&quot;Spad is the simple concept of offering free plans and ideas for designing very cheap, great flying airplanes made from Coroplast, gutterpipe, aluminum, or anything else we can find that works! The Spad concept is also the world wide sharing of these ideas and most of all, having fun with our hobby!&quot;

The above quote is from [http://www.spadtothebone.com spadtothebone] written by the founders of the SPAD concept. SPAD stand fo &quot;Simple Plastic Airplane Design&quot; and refers to the construction method as well as the philosophy. SPAD plans are almost always published freely online and shared, so you could describe it as unofficially [http://en.wikipedia.org/Open_source open source].

This section's eventual aim is to archive and collect every scrap of information that could possibly be useful in building and flying SPAD model aircraft.

=== Why SPAD? ===
Another quote from [http://www.spadtothebone.com spadtothebone] goes like this:

'''&quot;Less money. Less work. Less fear. More flying.&quot;'''

That is, essentially, what SPAD is all about. SPADs are, on the most part, very ugly (with a few notable exceptions) but this is mostly due to the fact that they are designed to be functional, not aesthetic. SPADs are on the whole extremely tough and surprisingly good fliers, if constructed well.

====Advantages:====
*Tough
*Easy and very quick to build
*Very cheap to make (averaging less than £5 ($10) per airframe)
*Fly well

====Disadvantages:====
*Ugly
*Fellow club members may be hostile, although usually they are converted after they see how it fares in a crash.


'''&quot;Trim it in the air.&quot;'''

These characteristics of SPADs make them ideal for use as trainers, r/c combat planes, or just tough old sport models. What they are NOT are beautiful pieces of painstaking engineering. In fact, a common trend of experienced SPAD modellers is to find the quickest most effective way of building, rather than the most sophisticated. For example, there are some who stick their entire models together with double sided tape, and no glue or screws. This is just one example of the openness of SPAD.

===Where do I start?===

Well, if you are prepared to embrace the SPAD philosophy and community, a great place to start would be on one of the many SPAD forums. These contain a wealth of information, and can be found in the links section at the bottom of this page. Read, read, read and drink in as much information as possible. This is the best way to start off in this hobby. Join one of the forums, introduce yourself and there will be many people there willing to help you.

If this is your first plane, you will need to start with a trainer. The [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/RC_Airplane/SPAD_Plans SPAD plans page] [nb: under construction] is a great place to start, along with [http://www.spadtothebone.com spadtothebone.com]. It is also very strongly recommended to '''FIND A CLUB'''. Teaching oneself to fly, even with SPADs is a very disapointing experience. Most clubs will offer to help you learn to fly your plane.

If you are already an experienced pilot, something more sporty like a [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/RC_Airplane/SPAD_Plans#Draco Draco] might be a good place to start.

Once you become more experience, the sky truly is the limit for spad designs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gstreamer is a powerful program and library for media processing. Its power lies in the fact that media data streams between elements performing many functions. Elements can be added by means of plugins. Here is an example of a command to convert a FLAC format song to MP3 format:
 gst-launch filesrc location = &quot;02 - Duel of the Fates.flac&quot; ! flacdec ! lame ! filesink location = &quot;Duel of the Fates.mp3&quot;

Some of its most popular uses include:
* Playing music and video (from command line or a program using the library)
* Format conversion
* Recording directly to a certain format.

This book will provide an introduction and in-depth tutorial to GStreamer.

----

== Grammar - Future ==

In Spanish, the future has the same function as the future in English - to state things that will happen. Its use is equal to verbs ending in '''-ar''', '''-er''' and '''-ir''' for regular verbs.

Example:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! Verb  
! Hablar
! Comer
! Vivir 
|-
| yo || hablar - é || comer - é || viver - é
|-
| tu || hablar - ás || comer - ás || viver - ás
|-
| el/usted || hablar - á || comer - á || viver - á
|-
| nosotros || hablar - emos || comer - emos || viver - emos
|- 
| vosotros || hablar - éis || comer - éis || viver - éis
|-
| ellos/ustedes || hablar - án || comer - án || viver - án
|}

There are some irregular verbs that have different conjugations in the future for the first person - ''yo'':
* venir: vendr - é
* tener: tendr - é
* poner: pondr - é
* salir: saldr - é
* poder: podr - é
* hacer: har -e
* querer: querr - é

== Functions ==

=== Soon realization ===
To express a plan for soon realization you need to use ''ir a'' + infinitivo. Example: '''Voy a visitar''' mi amigo. This means I'll leave to visit my friend soon, maybe in the next hour.

=== Realization decided ===
To express that a plan is really going to happen you need to use ''pensar'' + infinitivo. Example: '''Penso visitar''' mi amigo. This means I will, but maybe in weekend, maybe next week.

=== Realization not decided yet ===

To express that a plan may happen as you are not sure use ''estar pensando en '' + infinitivo. Example: '''Estoy pensando en visitar''' mi amigo. This means I am just planning, not sure yet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hello and Thanks==
Hi Babylace,

Thanks for your contributions to the AY Honors Answer Book!  I hope you don't mind, but I changed the formatting a little bit and turned some of your text into complete sentences.  I also added a couple of &quot;TODO&quot; items. 

But mostly, I just wanted to thank you for your input.  It is really, Really, REALLY appreciated!
[[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 19:16, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

==SPD vs NAD==
I have noticed that you have been adding (or changing) the requirements for various honors using the South Pacific Division's version.  Until now, I have been changing the SPD requirements to the NAD version, but this really doesn't make a lot of sense.  There's no reason the SPD shouldn't have a place in this answer book as well as the NAD.  I'm trying to think of a structure that would accomodate multiple divisions, but it might take a while to work it out.  We might have to fork the book at the top level kinda like this:

:AY Honors Answer Book (top level)
::SPD, NAD, EAD, EUD, etc at second level
:::Arts and Crafts, health and healing, etc at the third level
::::Individual Honors at the fourth level

Where the honor requirements are not different, we can use a common chapter.  This is going to be a LOT of work to fix, but I think it needs to be done.  There may be a few false starts and errors along the way, so I ask you to bear with me.

Thanks again for your work on this project. [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 02:15, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

== Instructions ==

You are doing things ''gently'' and ''slowly'' to preserve the eggnog's fluffiness.

# Beat egg-yolks with 1/2 of sugar, set aside.
# Beat egg-whites until stiff, then mix in other 1/2 of sugar.
# Pour the yolks into the whites and mix together slowly.
# Stir in white rum slowly
# Stir in milk slowly
# Stir in whiskey slowly
# Stir in 1/2 of cream slowly
# Whip rest (1/2) of cream and fold in carefully.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since the dog travels at 10 km/hr, in 1 hour it will cover 10 km.

The boy moves at 5km/hr the girl at 4km/hr. After 1 hour the distance between them is 1km. The dog is within 1km. The distance between the boy and girl will increase linearly over the one hour, to its maximum of 1km. During this time the dog has been running back and forth at 10km/hr.To calculate its exact position is a VERY scientific question.

The boy moves at 5km/hr the girl at 4km/hr, but we don´t know for how long they have being moving. They could have just started to move and there´s virtually no distance between them. So the dog, whatever his speed, could just had travel a couple meters. Also we dont know if he stops when he gets back to the boy or continues running, and for how long. Or if his speed is constant and movement linear. Maybe after a 100 meters he got tired and took a nap.

[[Image:Grggsmry.gif|right]]
There are many forms of shorthand, but the one most commonly used in the United States is ''Gregg Shorthand''.  This section presents the ''Century Edition''.

Gregg Shorthand is a phonetic writing system, which means it records the sounds of the speaker, not the English spelling.  It uses the ''f'' stroke for the ''f'' sound in ''funnel'', ''telephone'', and ''laugh''.  All silent letters are omitted.  The image on the right shows the strokes of Gregg Shorthand Simplified.  The sounds are represented in this image by the ''International Phonetic Alphabet''. The system is written from left to right and the letters are joined.  

*''Sh'' (and ''zh''), ''Ch'', and ''J'' (or ''Dzh'') are written downward.
*''T'' and ''d'' are written upward.  
*''X'' is expressed by putting a slight backward slant on the ''s'', though the word beginning ''ex'' is just written ''es''.  
*''W'', when in the middle of a word, is notated with a short dash under the next vowel.  
*''Q'' is usually a ''k'' with a dash underneath the next vowel.  

Many of the letters shown are also what are called &quot;brief forms&quot;.  For instance, &quot;which&quot; is written as ''ch''.  These brief forms are shown on the image to the right.  There are several others not shown, however.  For instance, &quot;please&quot; is written as simply ''pl'', and &quot;govern&quot; as ''gv''.  These brief forms can make Gregg Shorthand much faster.

Another mechanism for increasing the speed of shorthand is phrasing.  Based on the calculation that lifting the pen between words has a speed cost equivalent to one stroke, phrasing is the combination of several smaller distinct forms into one outline, for example &quot;it may be that the&quot; could be written in one outline, &quot;(tm)ab(th)a(th)&quot;.  &quot;I have not been able&quot; would be written, &quot;avnba&quot; (Note that to the eye of the reader this phrase written in shorthand looks like &quot;I-have-not-been-able&quot;, and so phrasing is far more legible than a longhand explanation of the principle may lead one to believe).

The vowels in Gregg shorthand are divided into three main groups that very rarely require further notation.  The ''a'' is a large circle, and can stand for the ''a'' in &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;father&quot;, and &quot;ache&quot;.  The ''e'' is a small circle, and can stand for the ''e'' in ''feed'' and ''help'', the ''i'' in ''trim'' and ''marine'', and the obscure vowel in ''her'' and ''learn''.  The ''ī'' represents the ''i'' in ''fine''.  The ''o'' is a small hook that represents the ''al'' in ''talk'', the ''o'' in ''cone'', ''jot'', and ''order''.  The ''u'' is a tiny hook that expresses the three vowel sounds heard in the words ''who'', ''up'', and ''foot''.  It also expresses a ''w'' at the beginning of a word.

There are special vowel markings for certain diphthongs (two-sound vowels).  The ow in ''how'' is just an ''a'' circle followed by a ''u'' hook.  The ''io'' in ''lion'' is written with a small circle inside a large circle.  The ''ia'' in ''piano'' and ''repudiate'' is notated as a large circle with a dot in its center.  The ''u'' in ''united'' is notated with a small circle followed by an ''u'' hook above it.

Due to the very simple alphabet, Gregg shorthand is very fast in writing.  It takes a great deal of practice, however, to master it.  Speeds of 280 WPM (where a word is 1.4 syllables) have been reached with this simple system before, and those notes are still legible to anyone else who knows the system.

This is the Lord's Prayer written in several forms of shorthand.  Gregg's is first (although it is an older version) followed by several others.

==Historical Notes==
''Shorthand'' was introduced in 1929, discontinued in 1956, and reintroduced in 1986.

I'm Rob, and I'm an [[:w:engineer|engineer]]. I grew up in [[:w:Rhawnhurst, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Northeast Philadelphia]], where I worked at [[:w:hobby shop|Al's Hobby Shop]] in the [[:w:Roosevelt Mall|Roosevelt Mall]]. After graduating Northeast High School in [[:w:1984 (song)|1984]], I went to [[:w:Penn State Abington|Penn State Ogontz]], and then moved to Penn State's [[:w:Penn State|main campus]] in [[:w:Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|1986]]. I received my degree in [[:w:Aerospace Engineering|Aerospace Engineering]] in [[:w:Invasion of Kuwait|1990]]. After working at convenience stores, the [[:w:Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], and a [[:w:department store|department store]], I landed my first job on [[:w:Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] in [[:w:Khobar Towers bombing|1996]], and moved to suburban [[:w:Washington, D.C|DC]] in order to work at [[:w:Goddard Space Flight Center|NASA Goddard]]. 

I left ''SOHO'' after 3 years, and then I worked on [[:w:NEAR Shoemaker|NEAR]] at [[:w:Johns Hopkins University|JHU]]/[[:w:Applied Physics Laboratory|APL]]. After NEAR was landed on [[:w:433 Eros|Eros]], I returned to Goddard to work on ''[[:w:Terra (satellite)|Terra]]''. After ''Terra'', I worked on ''[[:w:Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]]'', doing [[:w:GNC|GNC]] work before launch, and I became the Flight Software Engineer a year after launch, and also helped to support ''[[:w:Aura (satellite)|Aura]]'' pre-launch. I left ''Aqua'' and ''Aura'' in 2004 to jump at the chance to work on ''[[:w:Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]]'', because it meant moving back to [[:w:bucolic|bucolic]] [[:w:Happy Valley|Happy Valley]], otherwise known as [[:w:State College, Pennsylvania|State College, PA]]. I consider myself really fortunate to have the opportunity to live and work where I went to school.

===What I might like to write about===
I'd be interested in writing a wikibook about [[:w:spacecraft design|spacecraft design]] and operations. The emphasis would be on actual spacecraft engineering versus spacecraft of scientific fiction. I believe a large amount of spacecraft-related information already exists on [[:w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] and [[:w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]], and I'd like to begin to pull it together, but I think the subject is too large for a Wikipedia article or series of articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Brief Overview==
The '''Backgammon Chouette''' is a social, multi-player form of backgammon and was mostly played socially when you would have a number of players conversing and playing against each other on the same table. Now days with the broad reach of the internet this form of backgammon can be played across different countries and various platforms. It can be a tremendous amount of fun, with lots of cube turns, players taking different points of view, getting to rotate and play as a team-mate of another player one game and against him the next.
However, if it’s not done right, especially online, it can get boring quickly. This page will give you an outline of what a '''chouette''' is and how to play.

==Basic Terms and Rules of a Chouette==
One player – the “box” – plays against a team. One member of the team is the “Captain.” This all takes place on one board. The Captain has final say over all checker plays, although he can ask his team-mates for help in some situations. However, each player has his own doubling cube. He can double regardless of what his team-mates do, and he can take or drop if doubled on his own.
A '''chouette''' is played just like a money game. There is no “match score” – you play one game, win or lose points, then go on to the next game. Positions change every game. In general, if the box wins, he stays as the box; if the Captain wins he becomes the box. Whether the Captain wins or loses, the next player in line becomes the Captain. 

The scoring is just points won or lost. Each player has a running score, of plus or minus a certain number of points, or even. If you were playing for money, you would multiply this by the stakes, and that’s how many dollars ahead or behind you would be. Naturally, the sum of all the scores is always zero. 
Online '''chouettes''' can be somewhat awkward to run. There is no special software for '''chouettes'''. What is required is someone to run the '''chouette''' who understands a '''chouette''', whom I call a monitor. The monitor keeps track of the position of all cubes, and tallies the running score. When a '''chouette''' gets large, it gets to be a lot of work. 

Listed below is everyone’s responsibilities. From experience you should know that if everyone doesn’t follow these, it can really ruin things for everyone.
A '''chouette''' can be an awful lot of fun. For the team, there is the opportunity to gang up on one helpless victim (the box), to consult on checker plays, to show how much smarter you are than the others by, say, dropping a double and losing one point when everyone else goes on to lose a doubled gammon – or by taking and winning two points when most of your teammates dropped and lost one. There is the excitement of being the box and winning or losing 5 or 10 or 20 points at a time.

==Responsibilities When Playing a Chouette==

===When you are the Captain===

*Turn on Board Notation so that you can understand the comments your team is making.
*If you want advice on a move, type the move in the chat box at the bottom of the screen before moving. You do not have to ask for advice, or to follow it. But it will be very frustrating to your teammates if you don’t ask their advice and then make foolish moves. It is generally considered good practice that, if you are a relatively weak player, to ask advice from the strong players, and if you are the strongest player on the team to just move. The bottom line is that your teammates will forgive you anything if you win, but if you lose and they think you did so foolishly, you won’t become very popular! Remember too that everyone else wants to be involved in the game. If you just keep moving without ever asking for advice, even on close plays, you’re taking your teammates out of the game.
*When you are in a position where anyone on the team might even be thinking of doubling, wait just a couple seconds before rolling. Give them the chance to say “double.” If anyone doubles, make sure to wait until the box has decided on all the cubes. But also, don’t wait forever to roll. If there has been any cube action, give the monitor a minute to record the results. Remember, he’s got a lot of paperwork to keep track of!
*Never use the “double” button on the board. If you want to double, say “double.” It will be very frustrating if the box reflexively drops and the game ends.
*A special situation arises if you drop but someone else on the team takes. Now, you are no longer allowed to participate in the game. In a real-life '''chouette''', you would leave your seat and the person next in line to be Captain would take your place.

===When you are the Box===

*If you are doubled by one or more players, wait until everyone has had a chance to double. You might ask “anyone else?” You do not have to decide to take or drop until everyone has doubled who wants to. If you’re going to drop, then of course everyone will suddenly want to double!
*If you double, wait for everyone to decide to take or drop before rolling, and give the monitor time to record the results.

===When you are the Team===

*Pay Attention. It’s easy to lose interest in the game if you’re not an active participant, but you are very much a part of the game. One of the most frustrating things is when the box says “Double all” and one or two players on the team don’t respond and you’re waiting.
*Know the position of your cube. If you have doubled and the box has taken, don’t say “double.” You can’t double, and it will only slow the game down if the monitor has to tell you that you have already given your cube. (Of course, if you doubled to 2 and the box has redoubled to 4, you can now double to 8!) Likewise, if you doubled and the box dropped, you’ve already won this game. You’re out, you can’t win the same game twice!

===For All Chouette Players===

*Take the game seriously. If a player always doubles at the first opportunity, takes every double, and immediately redoubles. That kind of play takes away from the game, because this is supposed to be fun, but it’s supposed to be a test of skill. Pretend you’re playing for $10 a point! If that were the case, you’d play your best; you’d certainly pay attention even when you’re on the team. And if you were Captain and had money on the line, you’d try to get the better players to help you win. If you pretend you’re playing for real money, you’ll find you have more fun!
*Be patient. A real-life '''chouette''' goes almost as fast as a regular game, and when it slows down it's because people are discussing (or arguing!) over checker plays, which is part of the fun. Online, because the software doesn’t support '''chouettes''', it can slow down a little. Try to be a little patient and keep focused on the game.
*If you have to leave, leave. There’s no requirement that you stay in a '''chouette''' for any particular period of time. If you’re losing interest, then just say that you’re leaving and leave. It’s best if you stay to the end of the current game, though. 

==Rules for Chouettes==

# Jacoby Rule, backgammon beavers but no backgammon raccoons. explanations to these terms can be found in the [[../Glossary|glossary]].
# Players on the team can consult only after their cube has been turned. This means that the Captain is free to play the opening in peace, while getting help once the game has advanced.
# If any player drops, the Captain may buy his cube. What that means is that the player who drops pays the Captain the undoubled value of the cube, rather than the box. The Captain is now playing with two (or three or four or five) cubes against the box.
# If all players but one drop, that player must either drop or he '''must''' buy all the other cubes. This prevents one player from holding up the game. However, in this case it works a little differently. The box still gets the point from all the cubes. However, each player on the team pays the remaining player one additional point, and they now join the box. If you are doubled and drop, you are saying that you would rather pay one point to get out of the game than play on with a 2-cube. So if someone said “I think it’s better to play on with a 2-cube than drop” you should be willing to say “OK, I will pay you one point to take that inferior side of the board and play it with a 2-cube.” This way, if one player wants to play on, everyone is still involved in the game.
# Settlements are allowed. Lets look at a very simple example. Suppose you are in a last-roll position. The cube is at 4, and you have one checker on your 5-point and one on your one-point; your opponent has one checker on his one-point. You have 23 rolls that win the game and 13 that lose. On average in 36 games you will win 92 points and lose 52, for a net average of (92-52) / 36, or about 1.1 points. You might say “I’ll take one point.” Anyone who wants can now pay you one point and the game ends for them. Settlements can be proposed by either side at any time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Wikipedia AfD for backgammon chouette ==

As you might have noticed the article [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backgammon_Chouette Wikipedia:Backgammon Chouette] in wikipedia has an AfD and a discussion on it of weather it should be placed in wikibooks or in wikipedia. Currently what i think will happen is that the longer version of the article will be here if deemed to be good enough, and the short version of the article will hopefully be accepted in wikipedia, but i guess time will tell in the next 5 days of this AfD [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Backgammon_Chouette discussion] about the article, where the main concern is that it is a game manual and is better suited for wikibooks. I partially disagree because a chouette is a form of backgammon play that people try to understand what it is about, thus a wikipedia definition is needed. Moreover, if a reader wants to find out more about the rules and gameplay of this chouette he will get a link to the wikibooks article in order to know about how to play this great game.

Can someone help me with deleting this page? it is new and i know moved the content to a different link, there should be no problem in deleting this page because it is still a very much new page here. I am new here and i am really kean on making a backgammon book. Thanks and sorry for the mess.

=Introduction=
[[File:entropie.png|thumb|Low and high entropy. For any state of any system there is a number that describes how messy it is, this number is called entropy. Any spontaneous process will increase a system's entropy (as stated by the second law).]]

;Diffusion: the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. For example, if a bottle of air freshener is sprayed on one side of a room, the fragrance would eventually be able to be smelled on the opposite side of the room. The air freshener diffused from an area of high concentration (where it was first sprayed) to an area of low concentration (the rest of the room). Eventually, an equilibrium will be reached, and the concentration will be uniform throughout the room, and there will be no net movement of molecules.

;Osmosis: a special case of diffusion, in which water will diffuse across a selectively permeable membrane. Water will diffuse from an area of higher water concentration (low solute concentration), to a lower water concentration (high solute concentration).
Water potential is the measure of free energy of water in a solution.  Water will always move from an area of higher water potential (more water molecules) to an area of lower water potential (fewer water molecules). Water potential is affected by two factors, the addition of solute and physical pressure.
In this lab, we will investigate the processes of diffusion and osmosis in a model membrane system, and investigate the effect of solute concentration on water potential as it relates to living plant tissues.

;Water Potential
:is the potential energy of water in proportion to dirty water.  It is defined by the formula Ψ = Ψ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + Ψ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; where
::*Ψ is the total water potential
::*Ψ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the solute potential of the solution
::*Ψ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the pressure potential of the solution

Osmosis and diffusion are two of the most important processes in the study of how organisms maintain homeostasis, particularly with regard to their electrolyte and water balances.  This AP lab attempts to demonstrate the process of osmosis using dialysis bags.


=Expected Results and Analysis=
From only having glucose and starch within the dialysis bag, the glucose diffuses and there is a presence of glucose inside the cup that was initially distilled water and the absence of starch. This is because the selectively permeable dialysis bag, cell membrane, only allows small molecules, such as glucose and water to pass, but not large polysaccharides like starch.

=Conclusions=




Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. One can see the effects of diffusion when one puts several balls tightly packed in a room and open the door to an adjacent room. The balls will gradually slide to the other room. Due to diffusion since the room had a high concentration of balls and the new room did not the balls diffused equally to both rooms. Another important piece of information to know about diffusion is that it is passive which means it requires no energy. Osmosis on the other hand is exactly like diffusion except that in osmosis the object that is being diffused is water, whereas diffusion implies no specific object. One example of osmosis can be seen in a plant when one pours water into a plant and the plant becomes turgid. This is because there is a lower concentration of water inside the plant so water diffuses into the plant. Osmosis like diffusion is also passive.

==Foreword==

What attracts people to Biology and Science? I think it's curiosity. As a child we question the world around us constantly. We ask adults about it. We test and experiment. In fact children are the first scientists. But as we age, we learn not to question, and some of the big questions of our childhood may never be answered. 

I think the best way to teach science is to rekindle the spirit that asks those big questions, and to endeavor to awaken the heart that wants to explore the universe and discover what rules govern it. 

This material is based on lectures that I presented to students in introductory college Biology courses presented at Navarro Community College. That doesn't mean that you have to be taking a college course to understand this work. I have tried to make this book easily readable and browseable by anyone interested. This is a work in progress. Hopefully I will be able to update the book as I find which parts of it work and which parts do not.

I would like to say first that I make mistakes, and sometimes I say things that are completely wrong. I write this book as an open book partially in the hope that others will find my mistakes and correct them. 

I hope that this work will be useful and help to awaken an interest in Science and a love of Biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">--Red Onion Osmosis Lab --

Using red onion really helps in this lab because the cells are already dyed. 
The problem is that you cannot use the thin membrane between the onion layers to perform this experiment. You must peel the top layer off of the onion off to do this lab. For this reason, It may be prudent for the instructor to use a razor blade and prepare the samples in advance.

Smaller samples will make better pictures. Closing the diaphram on the condensor will prevent the sample from appearing washed out under the microscope.

Students should focus on only the colored layer of cells. For best results focus on the cells on the edge of the sample as the salt will affect them first.

We prepared a 20% by weight salt solution and observed results within 5 minutes.


===Alternatives===
This laboratory can be done with other plant cells, but cells with many chloroplasts, such as ''Elodea'' are the best.



A demonstration can be done with blood cells, but remember that in this era fear of AIDS means that all blood samples must be treated with extreme caution. See your administrator before doing any laboratory using blood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Laboratory Setup==
In this laboratory it is important to rinse all glassware well before use.
Trace amounts of detergent on the glassware will affect the results.

The experiment requires about: 
15 minutes of student prep
5 minutes to perform, and 
15 - 20 minutes clean up.

===The dyes===
Sudan IV is a strongly hydrophobic dye and will give good results, but it does have some health hazards, so you may want the students to wear gloves.

Read the stains file entry on Sudan IV here.

http://stainsfile.info/StainsFile/dyes/26105.htm

Methylene blue is pretty safe. It may be an irritant. It is hydrophilic, but if there is detergent in the glass blue dots will also be suspended in the emulsion making results unclear.

The detergent will form an emulsion. Have the students compare the tubes to the control if they have difficulty determining which dyes are hydrophobic.

If methelene blue is unavailable, most store bought food colorings will do.
For inexpensive hydrophobic dyes, you might try a deep colored oil. Although I have not had a chance to test it, some brands of hot pepper oil found in the  Asian sections of grocery stores are dyed with red dye that may work in this experiment. Test out different substances before hand to see which work best.

==relevance==
This process of extracting chemicals by seeing which fraction (oil or water) they will dissolve in is a basic technique in organic chemistry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An attribute is, abstractly speaking, a piece of information about an entity. For example, an [[com.webobjects.eoaccess.EOEntity|EOEntity]] may represent a person. The first name of the person is an attribute. The zip code of the person's address may be an attribute. An attribute is represented in [[EOF]] as a [[com.webobjects.eoaccess.EOAttribute]] instance. If an entity's information comes strictly from a table, then an attribute will be the object representation of a column. A relationship in an entity may also be an attribute of the entity.

A &quot;class&quot; EOAttribute&quot; is distinguished from a non-class EOAttribute by whether or not the attribute is supposed to be an attribute of the class which models it. For example, if you have the first name of a person, that would be a class attribute. If you have an attribute you use in the entity to act as a key for a join, that attribute itself is not part of the class as such. It is part of the machinery used by the class. That key, itself, would not be something that one would want a user to know about. If that attribute is used in a join, and that join defines a relationship, then one would want to expose the relationship to a user. The relationship would be a class EOAttribute and the key in the join would be a non-class EOAttribute.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lab 3 - Organic Chemistry Lab ==

Organic molecules are chemicals which contain ''carbon''. The structure of a molecule and its charge determine whether or not it will dissolve in water.

Chemicals which can dissolve in water are said to be ''''hydrophilic''''(water loving) while those which do not dissolve in water are said to be ''''hydrophobic'''' (water fearing).

In the cell, hydrophilic molecules are found in the cytoplasm, while hydrophobic molecules are found in the phospholipid membranes.

Some molecules have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. These molecules are said to be ''''amphipathic''''.

Phospholipids, the molecules which make up the plasma membrane are amphipathic, they have a charged phosphate group which is hydrophilic as well as a hydrocarbon chain which is hydrophobic. This allows cells to remain dissolved in water.

Amphipathic chemicals will form 'emulsions'. Solutions where oil droplets stay suspended in the water. Hydrophobic molecules will separate into the oil layer, while hydrophilic molecules will dissolve in the water fraction of the cell.

In this lab we will determine if molecules are hydrophilic, hydrophobic or amphipathic.


===Instructions:===

1. Place four test tubes with lids in a test tube rack.
Fill each tube to about 1/4 full with corn oil, then
Add water until tube is about 2/3 full.

2. Add the following to each tube.

* Tube 1 - Control (do not add anything to this tube)
* Tube 2 - Sudan IV dye ( about 10 to 12 drops)
* Tube 3 - Methylene blue (about 5 drops)
* Tube 4 - Dishwashing detergent (about 1/2 dropper)


3. Seal each test tube and mix it well.


4. Let the tubes sit for several minutes in the test tube rack as the solutions separate out.



5. Sketch each tube showing whether the substance dissolved in the oil or water fraction.
If the tube does not separate out after several minutes, and the control has separated, list the chemical as amphipathic.



6.Fill the table.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 95%; text-align: left;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;

==Map==
Were all the countries on the map in existence in 1991-1998? [[User:Therequiembellishere|Therequiembellishere]] 21:25, 9 May 2007 (UTC)
:Does it matter? If we wanted to pick nits, we would actually have to go back to a medieval map, because it is, after all, supposed to reflect the wizarding world; and the names of the national Quidditch teams seem to reflect the world map from ca. 1600. Transylvania? As it is, we show the areas where the schools possibly are and where they draw from, and you can superimpose the national boundaries that you yourself prefer.

== Map of the locations of the know wizarding schools in Europe ==

Is this image worth putting in this book, and is it valuable for this particular page? [[:Image:HP Wizarding Schools possible locations.PNG]]

*Here are my assumptions for the coloured areas:
**First assumption: the school is located in a place where the language of the school is a mother tongue of the surrounding population.
**Second assumption: It is very difficult for an 11 year old student to follow the lessons in a language that is not the students's mother tongue, therefore the school is recruiting primarily in countries where the school teaching language is mother tongue. 
**Third assumptions: The school may also recruit, but less frequently, in places where the language is close enough from the school language so that the students do not have to learn a language that is too different from the school language.

*Locations
**Hogwarts location: Rowling says it is in Scotland in an Interview. I have assumed that it is not in the populated areas (Edimbourough and Glasgow) since GoF says the nearest muggle town is several miles away (that does not exist around Edinburgh and Glasgow). I have also excluded the Scottish Islands, since you can go to Hogwarts by train from London.
**Beauxbatons location: French speaking area. Hot weather (school uniform is very light), bouillabaisse is part of the food.
**Durmstrang location: Slavic country (Victor Krum is from Bulgaria, all other known students/teachers have a slavic name, all have a slavic accent when they speak). Latitude needs to be higher than Scotland (Dumbledore says that they are &quot;from the North&quot; while he is ins Scotland), and Krum says that the winter days are very short, and summer days particularly long, compared to Hogwarts. Also her says that there are lakes and mountains around it. I have chosen those spots that match all 3 pieces of information (Slavic language, latitude higher than Scotland, lake + mountain areas).

* Recruitment ground
**Hogwarts recruitment ground: Britain, but maybe Republic of Ireland (no language barrier to prevent it).
**Beauxbatons recruitment ground: All french speaking countries in Europe + maybe other latin speaking countries (the languages are close enough to French to make the linguistic jump?) and north African countries where French is taught in primary school.
**Durmstrang recruitment ground: once we have established that Durmstrang can only be in northern Russia, we can assume that Russian speaking countries are the primary recruitment ground. Bulgaria and other slavic speaking countries qualify as secondary recruitment ground because the other slavic languages could be close enough to Russian for the students to learn it.

I am happy to discuss the level of speculation that is acceptable for this book, and provide a new version of the image with less speculation if the muggle's guide main authors feel it is better so.

I can't wait for your feedback! --[[User:Lgriot|Lgriot]] 12:38, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

:That is certainly a well-thought-out argument. It would be great if you could integrate this into the image's discussion on the actual article page. I haven't criticized this technically since I'm a bit busy but users [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] and [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] will most likely want to discuss this a bit. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:02, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

::I actually was subconsciously making the same assumptions when I originally saw the map. I have to agree with all of them, and say that your comments are better reasoned than I had ever managed to come up with. My only concern is that I'm not 100% sure of how we define &quot;original research&quot;... but to my mind, this is much less speculative than many other things that we have speculated on in the process of writing these articles. To my mind, this is a useful image, and I would like to see it re-instated on the page. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:29, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

:Fwiw, my own (probably biased) opinion would have been that the images are quite valuable... They are in the spirit of the textbook: they are &quot;commenting&quot; on (or, they represent views based on) existing information about the discussed subject. They only present it better. :-D -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 13:46, 3 August 2007 (UTC)

== &quot;The Black Lake&quot; ==

A number of times, editors have called the lake on the Hogwarts grounds The Black Lake. I have just realized where that comes from. During the run-up to the Second Task in the movie ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', which I watched last night, it is referred to as the Black Lake repeatedly. Thus I think that it is  purely an artifact of the films, as I certainly don't recall it being referred to by that name in the books. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:20, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

== Class Sizes ==

One of the biggest problems in this series is the population of the school.

The author has pleaded an inability to work with numbers, saying that she had not been able to work out the size of the Wizarding classes, but that she had intended the student body at Hogwarts to number between 600 and 1000. The closest we have to a true number is that in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 12|chapter 12 of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where we are told that the normal class size is 30. While we only ever see Harry's dorm mates, Ron, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, and two of Hermione's, Lavender and Parvati, it is possible that there are additional dorms, possibly totaling three 5-person dorm rooms per year. The author has said that she limned characters for five male and five female individuals per house per year, and didn't carry things beyond that.

Given 30 students per House per year, then, each year group has a population of 120, for a total school student body of 840. This seems to tally with the mention of &quot;hundreds&quot; of students in the Great Hall at Harry's arrival, and the &quot;hundreds&quot; of people in the Slytherin stands at Quidditch — Slytherin house, with 30 people in each of 7 years, would have 210 students.

This number does seem unworkable on a number of fronts; in particular, it seems &quot;double Potions with the Slytherins&quot; or &quot;double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs&quot; would put sixty adolescent students in one dungeon or greenhouse under the supervision of a single teacher. Further, it would seem that with 28 sections (divided by house and year), a teacher of one of the six core subjects would somehow have to multiply themselves in order to teach more than once a week, as there are either 20 or 30 class periods in a week. Yet, the only subject with more than one teacher is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Divination|Divination]], which is jointly taught by Trelawney and Firenze after Harry's fifth year, despite Divination only being available to third-years and higher, and thus presumably needing fewer total contact hours.

== ??? ==

Why are the '''Questions''' and the ''Greater Picture''' sections entirely blank? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] ([[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|talk]]) 00:49, 7 November 2010 (UTC)

:Because nobody has yet come up with anything to put in either of those sections? For characters, if they don't appear in a book, we can eliminate the section for that book in the character write-up, but that is a sub-section, where Questions and Greater Picture are main sections. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:21, 2 January 2011 (UTC)

==More countries green==

Shouldn't the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, Germany, Austria, the German-speaking portion of Switzerland, and the Swedish-speaking portion of Finland be colored light green in the map, as they all speak Germanic languages like English? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:49, 12 March 2011 (UTC)
:I'd argue against. Scandinavian countries, while they do teach English in school, don't generally have school-age students who are fluent in English; and we don't see any Scandinavian natives in Hogwarts during the seven years there. And likewise, English in the German areas you discuss is pretty thin on the ground. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:35, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

===''Fewer'' countries green===

Shouldn't only the English-speaking parts of Ireland be colored green (because Gaelic is not related in any way to English), and shouldn't they be colored medium green, like most of Great Britain (because they speak the same language as said country)? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:46, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

==&lt;s&gt;More&lt;/s&gt; ''fewer'' countries orange==

Shouldn't Romania and Moldova be colored light orange in the map, as they both speak Romance languages, such as Romanian? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:49, 12 March 2011 (UTC)
:I don't think so. As with the green areas mentioned above, the language being in the same family does not imply an ability to speak that language. I think Romanians would have a great deal of trouble learning magic and French at the same time... in fact, I have some trouble with Spain and Italy being colored light orange, having been fluent in Spanish and knowing the difference between that and French. I could see Spain and Italy sharing a magic school, however... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:35, 13 March 2011 (UTC)
::In that case, don't you think Italy, Spain, and the Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland be recolored from light orange to gray, because of the language difference? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:48, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

== New boundaries ==

Should we redo the map so that medieval boundaries are shown in dotted red lines in addition to the modern boundaries in solid white lines, since the characters and localities mentioned seem to have strong ties (Transylvania etc.) to medieval countries and locations? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:54, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
:Would it really help? In my not-so-humble opinion, it would add confusion for not much actual gain. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:53, 4 August 2011 (UTC)

== Fewer countries pink? ==

Just exactly how close are the other Slavic languages actually to Russian (especially the South Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Croatian)? --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:58, 27 March 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Parallel computing'' and ''computer clusters'' are two separate subjects.  However, there is a very large cross over between the two which would make for large quantities of duplicated material should they be described separately.

The aim of this book is to provide a solid foundation for understanding all aspects of both parallel computing and computing clusters.  It will begin by providing an overview of both of the terms used in the book's title and then breaking down existing hardware and software practices to see how they fit into the overall picture.  The text will continue on to describe common features of parallel computing &amp; computer clusters in their basic forms - sometimes they are features not readily associated with the field such as the task scheduling in everyday operating systems.  To conclude the book aims to cover common uses for the technologies and provide some examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview of the subject matter ==

As mentioned in the Introduction, both parallel computing and computing clusters have a heavy overlap in their subject matter.

=== Parallel Computing ===

{{wikipedia|Parallel Computing}}Parallel computing is an ambiguous term covering two distinct areas of computing: designing single machines with many processors (hardware parallel computing) and designing software to split complex scenarios into manageable chunks (software parallel computing).

=== Parallel Computer ===

A ''parallel computer'' is one which has been designed and houses multiple MPUs each of which can work independently of its peers.  Many modern PCs are capable of housing two CPUs and an individual CPU can house multiple cores each of which can work independently of the others - both are examples of a computer which can perform multiple tasks in parallel. Note that a single-CPU, single-core machine running a multi-tasking operating system (such as MS Windows or one of the various flavours of Unix/Linux) is not running in parallel but is instead running many small chunks of tasks serially: the software is parallelised but the hardware is not.

=== Parallel Software ===

When designing software to work on a large data set it is often possible to split the data set into multiple smaller subsets without affecting the goal of the work as a whole.  For example, to retrieve all of the static web pages on an individual server, it is possible to retrieve each one individually without affecting the end result and the chunks of the data set can therefore be performed in parallel.  Once the data has been successfully determined to be split then the software can be designed in a way to allow individual CPUs to work on the smaller chunks &amp; thus many CPUs can work in parallel on many different chunks.

=== Computer Clusters ===

{{wikipedia|Computer cluster}}Computer clusters are a network made up of multiple individual machines to work towards or provide a common theme or aim.  For example, a simple search engine could be comprised of a pair of machines: one machine to retrieve and index the data and one machine to provide a front end for people to access the indexes.  In this manner, the cluster is formed of multiple different tasks, but are seen to be a single entity by those utilising the cluster.

Many clusters are set up to work towards the same common goal, working on similar data sets in similar manners.  In this form of scenario the cluster is computing in parallel and thus the divide between Parallel Computing and Computer Clusters becomes unclear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On speaking about a universal religion one should seriously consider the 'collective subconscious' as a real and immaterial existing entity which is something that engulfs the entire globe, like an egg shell. This 'thing' exists within our solar system and has over the life of the planet collected all experiences by every oxygen breathing being. We all add to it. No life experience is in vain and we also collect from it (as in dreams) continuously (sort of like a biological internet.
The question to be raised is whether this 'thing' is of and simultaneously separate from the planet and does the planet leave it's experiences behind if it should exit this realm of 'collective subconscious' for another planets inhabitants to inherit?

* What evidence is there to think this, please? [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 19:26, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

Based on the evolution of life on earth, a collective organism where we are just a part could be the next logical step. As one cell united to other cells as complex ogranism developed like us, the same process may happening now. It is not immaterial though, but it is not easy to see, because we are just a part.  As for a cell in your body, for the cell it is not obvious its purpose, or the meaning why it's there. There is no evidence, just analogy. We are getting more and more dependent on each other and on a system. If you look into a cell, it's small, but still very complex. A singe cell organism was able to survive on its own, but not the cell in your body, it became specialized and dependent.  We as human being are getting more and more specialized and dependent. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 00:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

Yes, I agree. Life could evolve so that separate entities become closely interdependent and thus form one composite structure.

However, a mutation can modify a cell to form one that may assist their host’s survival; this cell may survive and be replicated. This is how new cells originate. Organelles (for example, the bacterial endosymbiont that may have evolved into mitochondria, possibly) may be absorbed by a life-form and eventually become an integral part of the absorbing life-form.

Cells in our body obtain their energy from our body and, in return, contribute to our body’s maintenance or survival. This is why they are there. And you are right—a cell doesn’t live outside its supporting body for long.

What you suggest may happen, but it is likely to take a long time. Between then and now, I think that we have to evolve a better social-survival structure than the hit-and-miss one that organisations like the United Nations use now.  [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 15:55, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

Based on your suggestion, that is to aim to create oB (omnipotent being), a 'conscious civilisation'(collective consciousness) came to my mind. For us, the 'conscious civilisation' would look like as an omnipotent being. We would be the &quot;genes&quot; of these &quot;beings&quot;. Actually we would be the keeper of &quot;[[w:Memes|memes]]&quot; coined in 1976 by famous [[w:evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[w:Richard Dawkins]], refers to a unit of cultural [[w:information]] transferable from one mind to another. We exsist so our genes can survive. Civilisation exsist so we can survive. Genes have the information how to build our body. We have the information how to build a civilisation.

By undertanding how consciousness works, and some other things, we would keep the information how a &quot;good&quot; conscious civilisation should function. Those information would be copied when a new civilisation is created. The newly created civilisation would live in isolation with the other so it can change and improve or die, using the force of natural selection. Then it will be just metter of time when a civilisation will be able to leave our solar system, before the sun burns out.  [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 03:28, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

* If only what you write could happen!
* But, I think that religious beliefs prevent humans from contributing to the formation of an oB entity.
* Most religions teach us that this life is just a precursor to an after-life, and that behaving to achieve that is more important than behaving to ensure civilisation’s future.
* However, many groups see the need to plan and act for our future. For instance, many of us know that we should reduce our pollutants, lower our population (so that the bio-system could support it), etc. But this knowledge achieves nothing—because these groups do not unite. They do not formulate a single, unifying purpose. If such a thing existed, then a critical mass of people might form and they might formulate the kind of goals that are needed for our civilisation to survive.
* Perhaps another civilisation, maybe in a few million years on Earth, more likely upon other planet (since humans are exhausting this planet’s resources), might help form some kind of oB.
* But I don’t think our descendants will contribute. [[User:David Hockey|David Hockey]] 17:45, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the early stages of single CPU machines the CPU would typically sit on a dedicated system bus between itself and the memory.  Each memory access would pass along the bus and be returned from RAM directly.  As the speed of CPUs increased the speed of the RAM and the bus speed also increased.  Due to the electronics involved the cycle of memory access and RAM response became a bottleneck forcing the CPU to lose precious computing cycles waiting for the response to be returned (termed ''latency'').

To overcome this latency some designs involved placing a memory controller on the system bus which took the requests from the CPU and returned the results - the memory controller would keep a copy (a ''cache'') of recently accessed memory portions locally to itself and therefore being able to more rapidly respond to many requests involving sequential (such as program code) or locally scattered requests (such as variables regularly accessed by the program code).

As CPUs became even faster, the latency involved in retrieving RAM even from memory controller-cached areas became significantly costly.  The next stage of development would see the memory controller being positioned inside the die cast of the CPU itself (in many cases leaving memory controller on the bus as a duplicate) and thus the CPU cache was born.  As the CPU cache was on the CPU die cast, the bus between the CPU core and the CPU memory controller was far less in length and the memory controller could respond more rapidly, leaving less latency for the CPU until a non-cached element was required.

Still later and further engineering improvements meant the speed of the CPU cache began to mirror the speed of the CPU itself allowing each instruction cycle to go without ''wait states'' from it's cache.  Unfortunately the cost of such designs were significant and so a second layer or level of cache was placed onto the die cast and made from the cheaper (older) designs: CPUs now had ''Level 1'' and ''Level 2'' caches.  As the level 2 cache was cheaper it could be die cast in larger quantities than the level 1 cache and retain both reasonable production costs and savings over ordinary RAM access speeds as well as significant savings in populating the limited level 1 cache from the level 2 cache by comparison to RAM access speeds.

== RAM and multiple MPUs ==
With the simplest of multiple MPU designs each MPU has no cache and sits directly on the bus which allows for RAM accesses (direct RAM access or through a memory controller).  Extending from the single-CPU design, a multi-MPU design which only ever reads information can be simply designed: each MPU sends it's request on the bus but needs a way to identify from where the request came.  To this end the request must be extended in some fashion to label the request &amp; the most obvious identification is the slot in which the MPU sits (as indicated by the BIOS during the CPU's boot up process).  Responses coming back to the MPU without it's ID in the response can be safely ignored.  The identification process is often performed by a controller which is not a part of the multi-MPU make-up but instead a separate, specialist, MPU on the bus referred to as the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC).

Unfortunately, a system unable to write any data will be very limited in it's flexibility and must therefore be capable of writing the data back to the RAM.  The mechanism for writing back to the RAM becomes, again, a simple extension on that of the single-CPU system: write back the RAM indicating the MPU slot the request came from and any acknowledgement responses can be correctly identified in the same way allowing for any individual MPU to know their write request succeeded.

Alas, there's one significant flaw: what happens if two (or more) MPUs work on the same piece of data at the same time?  Each MPU reads the data from RAM, processes the data based on the program code the individual MPU is working on and writes back the result to RAM.  The issue resides in which MPU performed the write request last as it is that MPU's result which will reside in RAM and not the first.  To illustrate the issue more clearly, consider the following where the activity references the same memory location (a number).

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|'''Activity'''
|'''MPU 1'''
|'''MPU 2'''
|-
|Read memory from program code
|Is instructed to increment RAM location 0001
|Is instructed to decrement RAM location 0001
|-
|Read data from memory referenced by code
|Receives a value of 1
|Receives a value of 1
|-
|Process instruction
|Calculates a result of 2
|Calculates a result of 0
|-
|Read memory from program code
|Is instructed to put result to RAM location 0002
|Is instructed to put result to RAM location 0002
|-
|Process instruction
|Puts the value 2 to RAM location 0002
|Puts the value 0 to RAM location 0002
|}

If this were an SMP system, both MPUs would be processing at the same speed and both would reach each phase of the pipeline at the same time.  As a result, each would attempt to write their interpretation of the data back to RAM location 0002 at the same time.  What would be the value of RAM location 0002 afterwards?  Unfortunately, there's no guarantee unless some other method is put in place first to force this ''race condition'' not to occur.

=== Non-caching MPUs ===
In non-caching MPUs the MPU would request on the bus that a set range of memory be ''locked'' to prevent other processors from updating the memory region until the locking MPU has completed its own task.  This approach is inefficient as the locking prevents a second (or subsequent) MPU from accessing the memory region.

=== Introducing caching ===
With the introduction of caches into the processors, the problem at first becomes more prevalent.  Going back to a single-processor architecture with a cache to better illustrate the issue, the cache presents fast-access to a region of memory that has already been accessed.  The MPU begins with a cache which is entirely marked as ''invalid'' and from there any request for a byte of RAM will automate a ''page'' of RAM to be loaded into the cache (filling only a portion of the cache).  When the processor accesses a different section of non-cached RAM, that page of RAM is also loaded along-side the already cached page(s).  The process continues until the cache is full of valid pages.

Once the cache is full and the processor requires access to a page of RAM not yet cached, it must make a decision as to where in it's cache it will write this new page: wherever the page is written to it will overwrite existing cached RAM.  So, how does the processor decide?  Two basic methods are used: most recent kept and random.  In the first method the MPU's memory controller keeps track of the order in which the cached pages have been most recently accessed and chooses the eldest of the cached pages as the one to overwrite.

In particularly complex algorithms the eldest-accessed cached page may not be the most convenient to be removed: the code may jump around the RAM pages accessing very little from numerous different pages while rarely accessing the ''data set'' (by comparison to all ''program code'') or vice versa.  As a result of the jumping around in RAM the cache looses the data set (the most regularly-accessed single page of RAM) from it's cache.  In this scenario, the processor would be better loosing any one of the infrequently accessed program code pages than the data set itself (note that there is a very big argument to state any program behaving in this manner is either poorly programmed or badly compiled).

In addition to the caching of data being read from RAM, the writing of data back to RAM can be similarly cached by the processor and then written as an entire page when the page is flushed.  With a single-MPU system the caching of writes has no effect on other components in the system and can therefore take its time in writing back any modified cached pages (note that the RAM remains unchanged until the CPU writes the modified data back to RAM).  This method is termed ''lazy write''.

=== Simple cached writing ===
Back to a multiple-MPU system and the issue of using caches becomes far more obvious: when any processor writes to a portion of RAM the data is placed into its cache and not back into RAM.  If another MPU attempts to read that same section of RAM the data it receives will be out of date.  It is necessary to have the content of each of the MPU caches to be in tune with each other (or coherent, hence the term ''cache coherency'').  Various methods have been devised to ensure the caches remain as coherent as they can.  The simplest of these methods involves ensuring any write operations push the data immediately back to the RAM via the bus with all MPUs in the architecture monitoring the bus for write operations: when a write operation is seen on the bus the MPU checks it's own cache for that same page of RAM and if it is cached the page is immediately re-loaded from RAM.  This is a very expensive method for large parallel systems using common sub-sets of data: when a single MPU writes the data section each other MPU with the data cached must re-request the data.  The method is vastly improved by the other MPUs reading the data off the bus as it is written back to RAM (termed ''snooping'') thereby negating the need for a potential ''n - 1'' requests for reading the same RAM location.  In more advanced improvements, snooping is applied to all bus packets such that any single read operation can potentially become cached into all MPUs in the architecture.

=== Directory-based writing ===
Whether a cache is in use or not, a directory-based writing technique involves all RAM being controlled by a centrally located memory manager.  The MPUs involved respect only the information given to them by the memory manager and requests for writes can come from the memory manager to an individual MPU requesting for the data to be written back immediately.

=== MOESI &amp; predecesors ===
More advanced techniques exist for cache coherency and these begin with a similar set of abilities. Almost universally, each of these methods mark all pages of RAM as one of Modified, Shared or Invalid.  More complex methods introduce the markings of Exclusive and/or Owner.  The names of the methods are most commonly referred to by the initials of the methods implemented: MSI, MESI, MOSI and MOESI.

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|Status
|Description
|-
|Modified
|The page is marked as altered and resides in an MPU's cache but there is no valid copy in RAM.  In a method where Owner status is also used, a Modified page is not required by any other MPU.
|-
|Owner
|A complement to the Modified status where an otherwise Modified page is required and in use by other MPUs.  In massively parallel systems the architecture's memory controller(s) hold information on which other MPUs require the page and are thereby able to distribute the necessary page across bus boundaries.
|-
|Exclusive
|The MPU having the page is the only MPU with the page cached.  No other MPU has requested or retained the page.
|-
|Shared
|A page marked as shared indicates that one or more MPUs have the page in their cache.  If the method utilises Exclusive, then Shared indicates that more than one MPU has the page.
|-
|Invalid
|An Invalid cached page is a page which cannot be relied upon for valid data.  An MPU typically starts out with only invalid pages (a few systems pre-load an MPU's cache with simple boot-up code prior to booting).  Some MOESI implementations will mark a page as Invalid when the page is written to RAM.
|}

=== Avoiding the race condition ===
No matter which of the memory management techniques are used (and many more variations and techniques exist than described above), there remain possibilities to generate invalid data in the caching.  However, these possibilities are due to the nature of poor or misunderstood programming techniques and/or poor compilation.  This is covered in depth under the software chapter.

== Unified Memory Access ==
As the name suggests, Unified Memory Access (UMA) describes a method by which all accesses to memory are performed in a unified, equal, manner.  In a UMA design the RAM is typically pooled together and often a memory controller is available to assist the CPU(s) in accessing the RAM.  UMA is by far the most common method of implementing RAM access in a SMP.

== Non-Unified Memory Access ==
Very popular in massively parallel processing architectures and clusters alike.  The Non-Unified Memory Access (NUMA) architecture is a system (single machine or cluster) which houses a single RAM block which is distributed throughout the system.  For example, a four-processor architecture could be made up of two pairs of processors, each pair having direct access to 2GB of RAM.  In this scenario each pair is attached to a local bus and it's shared 2GB.  Access to the other pair's 2GB is performed through an inter-bus link (typically a memory controller).

A more extreme example of a NUMA system is often employed in clusters which attempt to present a ''single-system image'': each node in the cluster houses a portion of the ''system RAM'' with the cluster software being a localised memory controller.  A process existing on one node of the cluster must access a memory portion housed on another node.  By comparison to the first node accessing its own real RAM (through the localised cluster memory controller thereof), attempting to access the RAM portion on the alternate node involves a much more complex scenario: the first node must make the request of the second node to send the RAM across the network; the second node must check whether the portion is already being modified to another (third) node; if being modified, the second node must request the third node relinquishes the RAM access; the third node writes the modifications back to the second node and finally the second node releases the RAM portion to the requesting node.  Should two nodes require frequent modification access to the same RAM portion, the results can impact severely on the cluster's ability to process data in a worthy fashion.  Thankfully, software techniques exist (much the same as those described here) to lessen the impact of such a scenario.

      <comment>/* The sum of all numbers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Software ==

Under old-fashioned designs programs often cited as being akin to a document format: they begin with a header section; they then go into a loop perform the same task or series of tasks over and over until some condition is met and finally they perform some form of exit cleanup.  During the loop condition, the program performs a single task to completion prior to performing any subsequent condition and thus each task is performed in serial to it's prior and subsequent tasks.

Sometimes in a serial design the individual tasks have no bearing on each other and as such could be executed in any order.  Under these circumstances each task is ripe for being parallelised.  Many programs, however, are staged - tasks are interdependent and the amount of dependency determines how simply a set of serial tasks may be redesigned to work in parallel.

=== Designing parallel tasks ===

Before work can begin in earnest on the implementation of parallelising a suite of tasks, it is necessary to identify the inter-dependencies of the tasks.  To illustrate the principal problems faced by parallelising processes some fairly basic mathematical problems can be used as examples.

==== The sum of all numbers ====

The well-known problem faced by [[w:en:Carl Friedrich Gauss|Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and his fellow class mates: add up all the integers between 1 and 100.  Supposing there was no mathematical formula [(1 + N)*(N/2)] to calculate this particular problem and that the individual numbers really did have to be added up individually to each other:

The mathematical properties of adding any group of integers together allows the additional to take place in any order.  For example, ''1 + 2 + 3 + 4'' and ''4 + 3 + 2 + 1'' result in the same summation of 10.  By the same token ''(1 + 2) + (3 + 4)'' results in the equivalent calculation of ''3 + 7'' and in the end the same summation of 10.  The problem of adding just four numbers can be described in alternative ways also:''1 + (2 + 3) + 4'' or ''(1 + (2 + (3 + 4)))''.  In order to provide efficient parallelisation, it is important to design how best to split the problem at hand.  These latter two examples show more dependency on previous calculations than that of dividing the problem down the middle:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|Breakdown
|# Calculations
|# Independent calculations
|-
|''(1 + 2) + (3 + 4)''
|'''3''': 1+2=3; 3+4=7; 3+7=10
|'''2''': 1+2=3; 3+4=7
|-
|''1 + (2 + 3) + 4''
|'''3''': 2+3=5; 5+1=6; 6+4=10
|'''0''': all calculations are dependent
|-
|''(1 + (2 + (3 + 4)))''
|'''3''': 3+4=7; 7+2=9; 9+1=10
|'''0''': all calculations are dependent
|}

This approach for dividing down the middle works for any series of numbers where the count of numbers is a factor of two: 8, 16, 32.  However, taking this initial approach to a longer series which utilises an even count of numbers provides another problem in the quest for parallelisation: ''1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6''.  This calculation can no longer be simply divided down the middle: ''1 + (2 + 3) + (4 + 5) + 6''.  It is already known that the calculation of 1 + 6 could be done, yet in this approach it is left out.  To combat this deficiency it is therefore necessary to alter the approach to work for all even counts of numbers: pairing.  Using pairing it is possible to reduce the calculations: ''(1 + 2) + (3 + 4) + (5 + 6)''.  The parallelisation has now reduced the original problem to that of ''3 + 7 + 11''.  The problem now enters a new phase entirely...

The problem still has not been solved for all counts of numbers - so far only even counts have been solved.  Due to mathematical properties it is not possible to break down the summation of ''3 + 7 + 11'' into the separate parts of ''3 + 7'' and ''7 + 11'' and thus knowing your subject matter becomes an ever-increasingly important aspect of the parallisation: ensuring that individual parts to do repeat the whole or part of another part.  For the problem at hand, then, it is a logical assumption that the tasks at hand can be ''partitioned'' into pairs and pairs of pairs until the problem as a whole is consumed with the possible exception of a single number to be added as the last step.  Thus, ''1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6'' can be reduced into the parallelised form of ''((1 + 2) + (3 + 4)) + (5 + 6)'' as it's most efficient.

==== The final step ====

The final step in the quest for the design of the parallelised problem may come as a surprising reversal: can the individual tasks be better implemented as a serial process?  Knowing the architecture the problem is to be implemented on becomes an additional design principal.  In the case of adding a small quantity of any numbers (not necessarily sequential as above), the majority of MPUs are very capable of performing on-die calculations in the form ''((a + b) + c) + d'' faster and more efficiently than of the form ''(a + b) + (c + d)'' due to the need to ''load'' and ''store'' the data into registers.  A command sequence for both tasks might appear as follows:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|Pseudo-computing cycle
|''((a + b) + c) + d''
|''(a + b) + (c + d)''

==What is the world made of?==

The ancient Greek philosophers studied the nature of all things.

They wanted to know what things were made of.
They knew that the things in the world had substance. 
They take up space. You can touch them and push against them.
They called this substance that all things are made of '''matter'''.


'''Matter''' is defined as any substance in the universe that has mass and occupies space.


'''Mass''' is a measure of how much matter there is in an object. 
On earth we measure mass by weighing an object.
'''Weight''', however can change. 
A person who weighs 180 pounds on the Earth would only weigh
about 30 pounds on the moon even though their mass would stay the same.

But these philosophers wanted to know what the fundamental things were that the universe was built of. If you take an object and cut it in half, and then cut that object in half, eventually you should get to some thing that you can't cut. Something that is the building block that all things are made of. They called this the ''''atom'''', which comes from the Greek prefix &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; which means &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; and the root &lt;b&gt;tom&lt;/b&gt; which means &lt;i&gt;to cut&lt;/i&gt;.

In the fifth century B.C. two philosophers, Democritus and Leucippus presented the first theory of atoms, however it took humans almost two an a half millennia to find out the structure of the atom.

==What is an Atom?==

[[Image:Atombau fluor.png|200px|frame|right|The structure of an atom.]]

An atom is the smallest unit of matter.
It is the smallest component of an element that still has the properties of that element.

Atoms are made of three particles. '''protons''', '''neutrons''', and '''electrons'''.  The protons and neutrons reside in the center of the atom, called the nucleus, while the electrons circle around them.

The protons have a positive charge and the neutrons have no charge. They make up the bulk of the weight of the atom. Around the nucleus, small charged particles called electrons move in complicated patterns called orbitals. 

The discovery of the structure of the atom changed how we looked at the world. For one, it explained chemistry. The properties of atoms are directly related to the number of protons found in their nucleus. The variation between different types of atoms such as hydrogen, which is very reactive, and helium, which is not, is directly related to the fact that hydrogen has one proton in its nucleus and helium has two.

'''4 Theorem''' ''A linear operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; from a finite-diemnsional vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt; into itself is injective if and only if it is surjective.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;e_1, ... e_n&lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. The following are equivalent: (i) &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; has zero kernel. (ii) &lt;math&gt;0 = T(\sum_{j=1}^n a_j e_j) = \sum_{j=1}^n a_j T(e_j)&lt;/math&gt; implies that all the &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; are zero. (iii) &lt;math&gt;T(e_1), ... T(e_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a basis for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{X}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the range of T is the span of the set &lt;math&gt;\{ T(e_1), ... T(e_n) \}&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem now follows. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''4 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a neighborhood of a point &lt;math&gt;(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} {\partial f_1 \over \partial x_1} &amp; \cdots &amp; {\partial f_1 \over \partial x_n} \\ \vdots &amp;

Proof (from [http://www.math.umn.edu/~choffrut/vignettes/ImplicitFunctionTheorem.pdf]):

Let &lt;math&gt;F(x, y) = (f(x, y), y)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;(x, y) \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

== Connected spaces ==
[[Image:Connected and disconnected spaces.svg|thumb|250px|The space ''A'' at top is connected; the shaded space ''B'' at bottom is not.]] A set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is ''connected'' if there exists no open cover of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; consisting of two disjoint open sets.

A ''connected component'' of a set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the &quot;maximal&quot; connected subsets containing &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;; that is, the component = &lt;math&gt;\bigcup&lt;/math&gt; connected set &lt;math&gt;\subset G&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. Every topological space, in other words, consists of components, which are necessarily disjoint and closed. That a topological space consists of exactly one component is equivalent to that the space is connected.

To give an example, induce to an arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; a topology as a collection of any subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the finest topology). The topological space &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has no closed sets since every open set in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is also closed. The components of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are the same as all the subsets of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; since .

'''4.3 Theorem''' ''The following are equivalent. Given a topological space &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, ''
# &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is connected.
# If &lt;math&gt;G = A \cup B&lt;/math&gt;, then both &lt;math&gt;\overline{A} \cap B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A \cap \overline{B}&lt;/math&gt; are nonempty.
# Only &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; have empty boundary.
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;G = A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; for some sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\overline{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint, so are &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;A \subset \overline{A}&lt;/math&gt;. This is to say that (1) is false, which also follows if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\overline{B}&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint for the same reasoning. This shows that (1) implies (2). Now suppose &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty, open, closed subset of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that is not &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then so is &lt;math&gt;G \backslash E&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;G = E \cup (G \backslash E)&lt;/math&gt;, the disjoint union of an open set and a closed set. This contradicts (2). Hence, (2) implies (3. Finally, suppose (1) is false; that is, there are at least two components of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, either of which has empty boundary but is not &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A ''path'' is a continuous function from [0, 1] to some space; e.g., a straight-line represented by &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; = 
A path is a ''loop'' if f(0) = f(1). e.g., a unit circle represented by &lt;math&gt;f(t) = e^{t 2 \pi i}&lt;/math&gt;.

Two points &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are said to be ''jointed'' by a path &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; if f(0) = a and f(1) = b. We say the space is ''path-connected'', the importance of which notion is the following.

'''5.1 Theorem''' ''A set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is path-connected set if and only if it is connected.''&lt;br /&gt;

[[image:Homotopy_between_two_paths.svg|right|thumb|Two paths that are homotopic.]]Two paths are said to be ''homotopic'' if FIXME.

We say a space is ''simply connected'' if every path in the space is homotopic to a point. For example, in the plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, every circle centered at the origin is homotopic to the origin. But in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2 / {0}&lt;/math&gt; the circle fails to be homotopic to the origin. Hence, the former is simply connected while the latter is not. We also see, in light of theorem 3.1, that every simply-connected space is connected.

'''5.1 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a set. The following are equivalent.''
* ''(i) &lt;math&gt;df = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant for any &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{C}^1(E)&lt;/math&gt;''
* ''(ii) &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is connected.''

== Partition of unities ==

'''4 Lemma (Urysohn)''' ''A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is normal if and only if for any disjoint closed sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; there exists a continuous function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0 \le f \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f = 1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof (from [[w:Urysohn%27s_lemma|Urysohn's lemma]]):

'''4 Corollary''' ''A topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is completely regular if and only if there exists a continuous injection from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to a compact Hausdorff space with continuous inverse.''&lt;br /&gt;

'''4 Theorem''' ''A Hausdorff space is paracompact if and only if it admits a partition of unity.''

== Sheaf theory ==

== to be merged ==
In this chapter, we shall prove (after some works are done) Cauchy's integral formula, first by the Stoke's theorem then again by the notion of the winding number.

'''6.1 Theorem''' There exists ''a partition of unity'' &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; subordinate to the cover &lt;math&gt;\{G_j\}&lt;/math&gt;; that is:
* (a) &lt;math&gt;\phi_i&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely differentiable in every &lt;math&gt;G_j&lt;/math&gt;.
* (b) &lt;math&gt;\mbox{supp }\phi_j&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;G_j&lt;/math&gt;.
* (c) If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;G_j&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_1^N \phi_j = 1&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. (locally finite)
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; = the union of all &lt;math&gt;G_j&lt;/math&gt;. Choose &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;C^{\infty}(G)&lt;/math&gt; so that {all &lt;math&gt;\mbox{supp }g_j&lt;/math&gt;} covers &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 0 \le g_j \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. (See the lemma for why this is possible.)&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 = g_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi_2 = (1 - g_1)g_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi_3 = (1 - g_1)(1 - g_2)g_3&lt;/math&gt; and so forth. If &lt;math&gt;\sum_1^m \phi_j = 1 - \prod_1^m g_j&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, then the computation gives: &lt;math&gt;\sum_1^{m + 1} \phi_j = 1 - \prod_1^{m + 1} g_j&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\phi_1 = 1 - (1 - g_1)&lt;/math&gt;, by induction,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_1^{\infty} \phi_j = 1 - \prod_1^{\infty} g_j&lt;/math&gt;, which is locally finite.
For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G_j&lt;/math&gt;, some &lt;math&gt;g_j(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, (c) holds and the others (a) and (b) are also true by construction. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

We define ''the integral of a form &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;'' by for a partition of unity &lt;math&gt;\phi_j&lt;/math&gt; subordinate to the locally finite cover &lt;math&gt;\{E_j\}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_E \theta = \sum \int_{E_j} \phi_j \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

'''6.1 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is analytic in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then:''
: &lt;math&gt; f(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{f(\zeta) d\zeta}{\zeta-z} \ \ \  \forall z \in \Omega &lt;/math&gt;.
(See also: [[Calculus:Complex_analysis]])

We say a function ''f'' satisfies the ''mean value property'' when:

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = {1 \over 2 \pi} \int (z + \epsilon e^{i \theta}) d\theta&lt;/math&gt;.

An analytic function is an archetypical example, for the property is the immediate consequence of Caucy's integral formula.  If ''f'' has the mean value property, then, for one, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic, and for another, the maximal principle become applicable to it.

'''6.1 Theorem'''&lt;br /&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is analytic in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then the following are equivalent:
* (a) &lt;math&gt;u^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; (z) = 0 for all &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
* (b) &lt;math&gt;u \mid_\omega&lt;/math&gt; = 0 for some &lt;math&gt;\omega \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; open.
* (c) &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; has a non-isolated zero.
and if any of the above is true, then
* (d) &lt;math&gt;u \mid_\Omega&lt;/math&gt; = 0.
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;E = \{ f : f \mid_\omega \}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, then its derivative: 
:&lt;math&gt;\dot u = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} h^{-1} (f(x + h) - f(x))&lt;/math&gt;
is 0 in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; consists of interior points, and so we may suppose &lt;math&gt;x + h&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, from (b), (a) follows. That (b) implies (c) is obvious since an interior point is non-isolated. To show (d), let ''Z'' be &lt;math&gt;\{ z \subset \Omega : f(z) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is closed since the inverse of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, which is continuous by the inverse theorem, maps a closed set {0} back to &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is also open, which we can know by considering a power series expansion. Since &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty by assumption, (d) follows after (a). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt; (FIXME: this is still a partial proof)

'''6 Theorem (Runge)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;K \subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; be compact, and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following are equivalent:''
:''(a) For any &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{A}(K)&lt;/math&gt; and an integer &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, we can find a &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{A}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; so that:''
::&lt;math&gt;\sup_K | f - u | &lt; 2^{-j}&lt;/math&gt;
:''(b) K is holomorphically convex.''
Proof: The theorem is a consequence of the  Hahn-Banach theorem.

A compact subset K of a complex plane is said to have ''the Runge property'' if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; satisfies any of the statements in the theorem.

'''6.2 Theorem (Weierstrass)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; be open. Let the sequence &lt;math&gt;z_j \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt; be discrete, and &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of arbitrary integers. Then there exists a nonzero &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal{A}(\Omega \backslash \{ z_1, z_2, ... \})&lt;/math&gt; such that for each &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(z - z_j)^(-n_j) f&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero and analytic in some open set containing &lt;math&gt;z_j&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;K_j&lt;/math&gt; be an exhaustion by compact sets of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; with the Runge property. By the Runge property, for each &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, we find a &lt;math&gt;u_j \in \mathcal{A}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; so that:
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{K_j} | (z - z_j)^{n_j} + u_j | &lt; 2^{-j}&lt;/math&gt;
where since the sequence &lt;math&gt;z_j&lt;/math&gt; is discrete, we may suppose &lt;math&gt;z_k \not \in K_j&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;k \le j&lt;/math&gt;. Let
:&lt;math&gt;g = \sum_1^\infty (z - z_j)^{n_j} + u_j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(z) = e^{\int_0^z g(s)ds}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is analytic in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; except for all &lt;math&gt;z_j&lt;/math&gt;. Also, let &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; be fixed and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be an open set containing &lt;math&gt;z_j&lt;/math&gt; and no other terms in the sequence. Then &lt;math&gt;{\dot f \over f} = g&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, by Cauchy's integral formula,
:&lt;math&gt;2 \pi i n_j = \int_{\omega} g(s)ds = \int_{\omega} { \dot f(s) \over f (s) }ds&lt;/math&gt;
It now follows that the argument principle says &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has a zero of order &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt; (if the order is negative, then it is actually a pole). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

This formulation is probably more illustrative, if it states more weakly.

'''6.2 Corollary''' ''Every discrete subset of &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is the zero and pole set of some analytic function.'' &lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Every discrete set is countable.

'''6 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; be open and connected and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; be one-form. Then the following are equivalent:

:(2) &lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma} = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a closed path.
:(3) &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \eta&lt;/math&gt; is independent of path.
Proof: On &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is exact, then &lt;math&gt;\eta = df&lt;/math&gt; for some zero-form &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
It thus follow:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \eta = \int_{\gamma} df = f(\gamma(1)) - f(\gamma(0))&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a closed path, then &lt;math&gt;\gamma(1) = \gamma(0)&lt;/math&gt; by definition, and hence, (2) is true. Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_2&lt;/math&gt; be arbitrary paths from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma_1 - \gamma_2} \eta = 0&lt;/math&gt; if (2) is true.
Thus, (2) implies (3). Finally, show (3) implies (1). Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \int_0^x \eta&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;df = \sum_1^n {\partial f \over \partial x_i} dx_i&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\int_x^{x + h_i} \eta = g(x + h_i) - g(x), then since &lt;math&gt;\int_0^{x + h_i} - \int_0^x = &lt;/math&gt;,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{\partial f \over \partial x_i} (x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= lim_{h_i \to \infty} {1 \over h_i} (\int_x^{x + h_i}\eta&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= lim_{h_i \to \infty} {1 \over h_i} (g(x + h_i) - g(x))&lt;/math&gt;
|
|&lt;math&gt;= {\partial g \over \partial x_i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Here the derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does exist since the integral is independent of path. We conclude that &lt;math&gt; df = \sum_1^n {\partial f \over \partial x_i} dx_i = \eta&lt;/math&gt;.



== Stokes formula ==
'''4 Theorem (Stokes)''' ''If &lt;math&gt;\omega \subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; has boundary which consists of finitely many Jordan curves, then:''
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial \omega} \eta = \int_\omega d\eta&lt;/math&gt;
Proof: (FIXME: To be written)

'''4 Corollary (Green)''' ''If &lt;math&gt;\omega \subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; has boundary which consists of finitely many Jordan curves, then we have:''
:''&lt;math&gt;\int_\omega (f\Delta g - g\Delta f) dx \wedge dy = \int_{\partial \omega} \left( f{\partial \over \partial x} g - g{\partial \over \partial x} f \right)dy - \left(f{\partial \over \partial y} g - g{\partial \over \partial y} f \right)dx&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: &lt;math&gt;d \left( f{\partial \over \partial x} g - {g \over \partial x} f \right) \wedge dy = \left( f {\partial^2 \over \partial x^2}g - g {\partial^2 \over \partial x^2}f \right) dx \wedge dy&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Harmonicity ==

Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. A function &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{C}^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''harmonic'' if
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_1^n {\partial^2 u \over \partial x_j^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt; (the Laplace equation)

We also define the ''poisson kernel''
:&lt;math&gt;P(x / R, y) = {C_n}^{-1} (1 - | x / R |^2) | y - x / R |^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of a unit ball in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.

'''4. Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \mbox{Ball}_R&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic on and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 
:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = \int P(x / R, y) u(Ry) d\omega(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Then using the Green's function
:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = \int P(x / r, y) u(ry) d\omega(y)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;|x| &lt; r &lt; R&lt;/math&gt;.
Letting &lt;math&gt;r \to R&lt;/math&gt; gives the direct part. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then the second derivative of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; = 0 since &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Corollary (mean value property)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \mbox{Ball}_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be harmonic on and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;. Then''
:&lt;math&gt;u(0) = \int u(Ry) {d\omega(y) \over C_n}&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; in the theorem. Then &lt;math&gt;P(0, y) = {C_n}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''4. Corollary (maximum principle)''' ''If &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;, then for &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;,''
:''&lt;math&gt;\min_{\mbox{b}\Omega}u \le u(x) \le \max_{\mbox{b}\Omega}u&lt;/math&gt;''
''where if the equality holds at some &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is constant in the component of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br &gt;
Proof: (i) Suppose &lt;math&gt;\Omega = \mbox{Ball}_R&lt;/math&gt;. Then for &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \int_{|y| = 1} P(x / R, y) u(Ry) d \omega(y)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le \sup_{\mbox{b}\Omega} u \int_{|y| = 1} P(x / R, y) d\omega(y)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \sup_{\mbox{b}\Omega} u&lt;/math&gt;
|}
since
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{|y| = 1} P(x / R) d\omega(y) \sup_{\mbox{b}\Omega} = 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;|x| \le |R|&lt;/math&gt;.
Likewise, &lt;math&gt;-u(x) \le \sup_{\mbox{b}\Omega} -u&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\inf_{\mbox{b}\Omega}u \le u(x) \le \sup_{\mbox{b}\Omega}u&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\inf&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sup&lt;/math&gt; are actually &lt;math&gt;\min&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\max&lt;/math&gt;, respectively since the continuity of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and the compactness of a closed ball. (ii) Suppose &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary. Let &lt;math&gt;x \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. From (i) it follows that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is constant on every open ball containing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is open, every component of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is open. Since an open set is the union of non-disjoint open balls, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is constant on the component of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''4. Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be continuous on &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following are equivalent:''
*''(i) &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is harmonic.''
*''(ii) If &lt;math&gt;\delta \le 0&lt;/math&gt; is given,
*:&lt;math&gt;\int u(x + ry) {d\omega(y) \over C_n} \wedge d\mu(r) = u(x) \int d\mu(r)&lt;/math&gt;
*''where &lt;math&gt;d(x, \mbox{b}\Omega) \le \delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{supp} (d\mu) \subset [0, \delta]&lt;/math&gt;''.
*''(iii) If &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is given, then (ii) holds.''
Proof: The mean value property says:
:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = \int u(x + ry) {d\omega(y) \over C_n}&lt;/math&gt;
By integrating both sides we get:
:&lt;math&gt;u(x) \int d\mu(r) = \int u(x + ry) {d\omega(y) \over C_n} \wedge d\mu(r)&lt;/math&gt;
Hence, (i) implies (ii). Clearly, (ii) implies (iii). Suppose (iii), and let &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be an open ball with &lt;math&gt;\overline{B} \subset \omega&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; be harmonic on &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{B}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u = h&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mbox{b}B&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Ball}_{\delta, x} \subset \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then using (iii)
:&lt;math&gt;\int (h - u)(x + ry) {d\omega(y) \over C_n} \wedge d\mu(r) = (h - u)(x) \int d\mu(r)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h - u = 0&lt;/math&gt; on the boundary of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;d\mu(r)&lt;/math&gt; has non-zero measure, &lt;math&gt;u = h&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, (iii) implies (i). &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Cauchy's integral formula ==

'''4 Thorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded open subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; whose boundary is smooth enough that Stokes' formula is applicable. If &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{C}^1(\overline{G})&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;u(w) =  {1 \over 2 \pi i} \int_{\partial G} {u(w) \over z - w} dz - {1 \over \pi} \int_G {\partial u \over \partial \bar z} (z) {1 \over z - w} dx \wedge dy&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;w \in G&lt;/math&gt;

'''4 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be a complex-valued measure with compact support in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and define
:&lt;math&gt;u(w) = \int {1 \over z - w} d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

== Schwarz lemma ==

'''4 Lemma (Schwarz)''' ''If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is analytic and &lt;math&gt;|f(z)| \le 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;|z| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then we have:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(z)| \le |z|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;|z| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover, if the equality in the above holds at some point &lt;math&gt;w \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: The hypothesis means that we can write &lt;math&gt;f(z) = zg(z)&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; r &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum principle says
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{|z| \le r} |g(z)| = \sup_{|z| = r} |g(z)| \le {1 \over r}&lt;/math&gt;.
and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is constant if &lt;math&gt;g = 1&lt;/math&gt; at some point on the circle &lt;math&gt;|z|=r&lt;/math&gt;. Letting &lt;math&gt;r \to 1&lt;/math&gt; completes the proof. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

== Addendum ==

A ''Lie algebra'' is an algebra whose multiplication, denoted by &lt;math&gt;[,]&lt;/math&gt;, satisfies
*(i) &lt;math&gt;[x, x] = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and
*(ii) &lt;math&gt;[[x, y], z] + [[y, z], x] + [[z, x], y] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x, y, z&lt;/math&gt;. Under the assumption (ii) we see (i) is equivalent to
:&lt;math&gt;0 = [x + y, x + y] = [x, y] + [y, x]&lt;/math&gt;.

When given an algebra is associative; i.e., &lt;math&gt;(xy)z = x(yz)&lt;/math&gt; we can turn the algebra into a Lie algebra by defining &lt;math&gt;[x, y] = xy - yx&lt;/math&gt;, called a ''commutator''. Indeed, it is clear that &lt;math&gt;[x, y]&lt;/math&gt; distributes over scalars and addition and the condition (i) holds. It then follows &lt;math&gt;[[x,y],z] = [x,[y,z]] - [y,[x,z]]&lt;/math&gt;.


Also,
&lt;math&gt; \int e^x = f(u^n)  &lt;/math&gt;

In a fallow up necessary to verify the correctness of an edit in regards to the domestication of cats I've come to note that most if not all of the dates ([[w:List of domesticated animals]]) where incorrect. As such I have serious doubt that the problem is continued in the rest of the book, I haven't checked outside of this section that I have now attempted to correct.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;Osmosis&lt;/big&gt; is defined as the diffusion of water (solvent) from areas of high solvent (low solute) concentration to areas of low solvent (high solute) concentration across a semi-permeable membrane. 

We call the liquid with more dissolved solutes in it a &lt;i&gt;hypertonic &lt;/i&gt;solution and the liquid with less dissoved solutes is called a &lt;i&gt;hypotonic&lt;/i&gt; solution. If the solutions on both sides of the membrane have the same concentration, it is called &lt;i&gt;isotonic&lt;/i&gt;. In osmosis, water moves from a hypotonic solution to a hypertonic solution.

All organisms must have strategies to deal with the movement of water into and out of their cells by osmosis. Plant cells usually have more dissolved solvents inside their cells than the water found in the soil. Because of this, water will rush into the cells. To prevent the cells from bursting (&lt;i&gt;lysis&lt;/i&gt;), plant cells are surrounded by a hard cell wall.

If the plant finds itself in a hypertonic solution, water will rush out of the cells causing the cells to shrivel up. This process is called &lt;i&gt;plasmolysis&lt;/i&gt;.

In this lab we will observe plasmolysis in red onion cells.

== Instructions: ==
:# Make a wet mount of red onion cells.
:# Observe the red cells under the microscope at 100X and 400X.
:# Draw the cells and label this drawing BEFORE.
:# While keeping the slide under the microscope.
Add a few drops of 20% salt solution to the edge of the slide.
You may need to pull the liquid across by placing a piece of paper on the opposite side of the slide at the edge of the coverslip.
:# Observe the cells. You may have to refocus the image as the increased liquid will change the location of the coverslip.
:# Draw the image and label this cell AFTER.
:# Explain what happened to the cells.

===Alternative Instructions:===
[[Image:Osmotic_pressure_on_blood_cells_diagram.svg|400px|thumb|right|Osmotic pressure on red blood cells immersed in various salt solutions]]
'''Alternative 1''': You may do the same using a small slice of potato, if red onion skin is not available.

'''Alternative 2 (only if there is no access to a microscope)''': Look at this image. Which diagram represents cells in regular blood?  Which represents cells in pure water?  Which represents cells in a saturated salt solution?  Answer these questions, then look at [[w:Osmosis#Examples_of_osmosis|this article]] and check your answers.  Then write a conjecture about why one's fingers seem &quot;pruny&quot; after a long bath, but not after being in the ocean for an extended time.

'''Warning'''
:Always wear gloves when doing experiments using blood samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Parallel Computing and Computer Clusters]] book ==

I saw your new book, and I really like the idea. It's about time that wikibooks had a resource on this topic. I would like to contribute if i can find the time and the reference material to do so. Anyway, I set up the pages [[Parallel Computing]] and [[Computer Clusters]] as redirect pages. Also, I shelved this book on the [[Wikibooks:Computer science bookshelf|Computer Science Bookshelf]], under the &quot;General Topics&quot; heading. Hopefully this will help attract some attention to your book. You can feel free to move this book to a different bookshelf, or even to cross reference it on a second bookshelf, if you feel so inclined. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:00, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

== [[Microprocessor Design]] Book ==

I've been working on a new book called [[Microprocessor Design]]. I think there is going to be some significant overlap between this new book and your parallel computing book. If you would like to come take a look and maybe contribute a little, it would be much appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:39, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

When the first transistor was invented, the scientists used it as an amplifier first, just to prove the mathematical concept behind it. Using transistors as amplifiers is an incredibly important use. From this model of transisters we get such things as &quot;Transistor Radios&quot; which rely on transistors for signal amplification. This page is going to discuss the basic mathematical model behind transistors and their use as amplifiers.

== Base, Collector, Emitter ==

In a typical Bipolar-Junction Transistor (BJT), there are three layers upon which it is constructed.  These layers are known as the emitter, base, and collector.  The emitter and collector make up most of the mass of the semiconducting layers while the base is a much thinner layer between them.  Current direction depends on whether the transistor a NPN or PNP-type device.
The emitter provides the charge carriers to the transistor, base controls the device current and collector collects the charge carriers.

== NPN And PNP ==
NPN:a n-type,a p-type,a n-type properly doped semiconductors are joined respectively in other words are sandwiched.
the first n-type semiconductor is called as collector.the next p-type semiconductor is called as base.the next n-type semi- conductor is called emitter.
PNP:A p-type,a n-type,a p-type properly doped semiconductors are joined respectively in other words are sandwiched.
the first p-type semiconductor is called as collector.the next n-type semiconductor is called as base.the next p-type semi- conductor is called emitter.
               
          The emitter region is heavily doped. The base region is lightly doped. The collector region is moderately doped.
           This condition is required for transistor to act as amplifier.Hence, it is doped so.

== Amplifier Rules ==
The following are the amplifier rules.
   1)the base region should be very thin compared to collector and emitter
   2)the emitter is heavily doped,the collector is moderately doped,the base is very lightly doped relatively.
   3)for transistor to function as an amplifier the collector-base junction should be forward biased,the emitter-base junction
     should be reverse biased

input /output relation:
There is no particular input-output relation because the input and output are not fixed. 
They vary according to the configuration of transistor.
There are 3 types of transistor configurations
  1)common emitter configuration
  2)common collector configuration
  3)common base configuration
then by applying Kirchhoff voltage and current rule in input and output circuits relation between input and output circuits can be found depending upon configuration.

This page is going to talk about Field Effect Transistors, how they are made, how they operate, and what are their basic characteristics.

== FETs ==
Field effect transistors (FETs) make use of the electric field induced by a potential on the Gate (G) terminal to create a conducting channel between the Drain (D) and Source (S) terminals.

== FETs vs BJTs ==
FET are more stable than BJT
more linearity
less noise,
input impedence is very large, output impedence very low compared to BJT's therefore it consumes less power than BJT's

== N and P Channel ==

== Preface ==

The material found here was developed from my own experience at Wikibooks, and ''is not an officially approved guide''. The thoughts represented here are my own and have often received little, if any, community approval, feedback, or input. I have personally created a number of new books from scratch here at Wikibooks, and I have learned a number of lessons from my work that I hope to be able to share with other new authors. 

This book is a part of my personal namespace, and as such it is not subject to ordinary community policies such as [[WB:NPOV|neutrality of opinion]]. Also, while I do encourage people to help make this book better by adding more material and experiences, I maintain complete creative control over this book and am the final authority as to what will stay here. I will monitor it closely for unauthorized edits or vandalism. Comments, suggestions, and criticisms are welcome on [[User talk:Whiteknight|my talk page]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Frank L. Lambert graduated with honors from Harvard University and received the doctorate in chemistry from the University of Chicago. After military service and industrial research and development, he joined the faculty of Occidental College in Los Angeles. His primary concern was teaching and his most important publication in the field, that few professors seem to have read until recently, urged the abandonment of the traditional lecture system in chemistry. (&quot;Why lecture -- since Gutenberg? Aren't textbooks available now?&quot;)

For many years he taught &quot;Enfolding Entropy&quot;, a course for non-science majors. His research in the polarography of halogen compounds was designed for undergraduate collaboration and all but one of his scientific articles prior to his retirement were published with student co-authors.

Professor emeritus from Occidental College, he became the first scientific advisor to the J. Paul Getty Museum. He continued to be a consultant to the Getty Conservation Institute when it was founded and as it grew to have a staff of 14 scientists. In the last decade he has also been concerned with improving the teaching of thermodynamics to first-year university students and making the concepts more understandable to non-scientists as well.

His articles in the Journal of Chemical Education have resulted in the removal of misleading ideas (such as shuffled cards or messy dorm rooms being examples of entropy increase) from all but one US general chemistry text. As of April 2006, some 15 university chemistry textbooks have deleted the unscientific concept &quot;entropy is disorder&quot; from their thermodynamics chapters because of these publications by Professor Lambert.

His five Web sites (http://www.entropysite.com as the master site, with links, articles and supplements) emphasize the concepts surrounding the second law rather than equations and calculations. They had more than 510,000 readers (from some 2 million 'hits') in 2005.</text>

==What is photosynthesis?==

Photosynthesis is making sugar using the energy of light.


===What is light?===


Light is a form of energy. The form of light that plants capture, as well as the light that you and I can see, is called '''visible light'''. The white light that shines on Earth from the sun is actually composed of light of many different colors. You can see these colors by using a piece of glass called a &lt;i&gt;prism&lt;/i&gt; that can split the light into different colors or wavelengths of light.

The rainbow of light created by a prism is called a spectrum and the colors of light are always in the same order:
'''Red''', 
'''Orange''', 
'''Yellow''', 
'''Green''', 
'''Blue''', 
'''Indigo''' and
'''Violet'''.
It also spreads into colors that we can't see becoming infrared off the edge of the red side of the spectrum, and ultraviolet off of the edge of the violet side of the spectrum.

In fact, the spectrum of light (called the ''electromagnetic spectrum'') is very large going from radio waves as big as planets to very powerful light called ''gamma rays'' whose wavelengths can be the size of subatomic particles.

Photosynthesis captures the energy from visible light but it doesn't use all of the colors of light equally. It mostly uses light from the blue and red parts of the spectrum.

===Why are plants green?===
[[Image:Leaf2chlorophyll.png |thumb|left|450px|Chlorophyll is a pigment found in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts in the leaves. This is why plants are green.]]
The simple answer is that plants are green because they have green Chloroplasts (organelles that carry out photosynthesis). 

But why are Chloroplasts green?
Chloroplasts are green because they contain the green pigment chlorophyll in their thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs red and blue light.
====Then why is chlorophyll green?====

To understand why chlorophyll is green, we must learn about pigments.
A &lt;i&gt;pigment&lt;/i&gt; is something that absorbs light. We said that chlorophyll is a pigment that absorbs blue and red light, so then why is it green?

That's because pigments absorb some wavelengths of light and reflect others. A yellow pigment is one that absorbs all of the wavelengths  of light except yellow. The yellow color is reflected into your eyes, and that is why it looks yellow. The reason a red shirt is red is because the red pigments in the shirt absorb all of the light except red. That reflected light is the color that the shirt appears. If it reflected all light, then it would be white.

So plants are green because chlorophyll reflects green light. And chlorophyll is found in all plants because it is the molecule that absorbs the light that is used to make sugar.

===Why do plants change color in the autumn?===

Although plants are green, in the fall they can turn other colors such as yellow, red, brown, and orange. This is because plants also contain other pigments such as carotenoids (yellow orange) and anthocyanins (mostly red). These other ''accessory pigments'' sit in the leaf along with the chlorophyll and they are the reason that leaves are many different shades of green. 

The green pigment covers them up for the most part in the summer, but in the fall, when the plants are beginning to go dormant in anticipation of the winter, the plant cells stop making chlorophyll, and the leaves lose their green color. Without it, we can see the colors of the other pigments in the leaves.

==How do plants capture light and use it?==

Photosynthesis is made up of two sets of reactions. The '''light reactions''' and the '''light-independent reactions''' (formerly the ''dark reactions''). The light reactions capture light energy and use it to make high energy chemicals that are used to power the light-independent reactions which make the sugar.

==General==
When storing batteries, remember to refrigerate the batteries to stretch their shelf life.  All batteries have some rate of self-discharge.

===[[Wikipedia:Nickel-cadmium battery|Nickel-cadmium]]===
When using a nickel-cadmium battery, remember to discharge the battery to &quot;empty&quot; before recharging it to &quot;full&quot; since the so-called [[Wikipedia:Memory effect|memory effect]] occurs if you recharge the battery after discharging only &quot;partially&quot;.

'''Vegetables''' are plants grown for their vegetative parts, such as leaves or stems. However, some &quot;vegetables&quot; are actually flower parts, and many fruits are referred to as vegetables as well.

Vegetable is a culinary term which may be applied to any part of an herbaceous plant that humans eat whole or in part is a vegetable, except for culinary fruit, grains, nuts, herbs, and spices. Mushrooms are also commonly considered vegetables, though of course these are not true plants.

='''Biographies: Louis Nèdère'''=
BORN: August 12th, 1821 in Saint-Jacques-de-l'Achigan, Province of Canada&lt;br&gt;
DIED: October 4th, 1846 in Saint Augustine-de-Catherine, Province of Canada
==Who was Louis Nèdère?==
Louis Nèdère was one of Embrun's first residents. He was part of the original group of 56 people that founded Saint Augustine-de-Catherine. But he was not just one of 56. Some members of the 'Founding 56' as they came to be called viewed him as their leader, although he wasn't offically their leader (they had no official leader, in fact). However, many members of the Founding 56 objected and didn't view Louis Nèdère as their leader.

Although the idea of starting a new settlement wasn't Nèdère's idea, he was the one that suggested a lumber industry.

==Nèdère's Life in the new settlement==
Nèdère took his wife, Marie, and his 1-year old son, Jean, with him on the search.

During the search, it was Nèdère that suggested that they investigate the Castor River. If it 
wasn't for Nèdère, Embrun would have been in a different location.

When they finally found the right spot and got off their boat at the present-day site of Embrun, Nèdère was weak and sick (It was later discovered that Nèdère got tuberculosis just before he left on the journey) and Jean was almost dead from exhaustion. Being the kindhearted person he was, Nèdère gave nearly all of his rations to Jean. Nèdère barely survived during the construction of the settlement that fall. When the town was completed in December, Nèdère was so weak that he could barely even walk. He definitely wasn't strong enough to search for food like the other members of the Founding 56 did. 

The Founding 56 didn't expect to find much food at that time of year. So, they worked out a system. The more food a settler found, the bigger his or her share of the food would be. But Nèdère was too weak to search for food. Marie thus decided to work extra hard to get enough food for the whole family to survive.

When Jean was 18 months old in January, he fell into a coma, probably from lack of energy. Nèdère was sure that he was dead. But they didn't want to bury him in the middle of the winter.

But Jean woke up three days later. Over the rest of 1846, Nèdère and his wife and son continued to struggle. Nèdère didn't participate in the lumber industry in 1846, and thus the other settlers refused to give him a share of the food. Nèdère starved to death that autumn. Marie died several days later.

Jean, however, was adopted by Jonathan Smithson, Nèdère's cousin, and one of the few anglophone members of the Founding 56.

It's Just a suggestion but.... It might be advantageous to rename this, as well as split up the topics.  For example, I think this text would could be renamed &quot;Business Organizations&quot; and do go a little more indepth on Sole Proprietorships, Limited Liability Companies, Partnerships, Limited Partnerships, Limited Liability Partnerships, as well as agency.  Also, it could then spin off the chapters on Securities Regulation, Corporate Finance, etc.</text>

==The Science of Life==

Biology is the science that studies Life. 

When we look at the world around us we see life. We ourselves are living creatures living in a world full of other living organisms. This world is full of complex and beautiful living things. But how do they work? What are they made of? Why do they do what they do? 

The science that studies life and tries to answer these questions is called '''Biology'''. Everyone should learn biology because life is not only around us, it is within us. It is something that we experience every day, every moment. To study Biology is to learn about ourselves. Who we are. What we are. Why we are.

In this textbook we will ask the big questions of life and try to find the answers. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

Questions like:
 [[#What is life?|What is life?]]
 [[Biology, Answering the Big Questions of Life/Photosynthesis|Why are plants green?]]
 [[Biology, Answering the Big Questions of Life/Atoms_and_Molecules|What is the world made of?]]

Feel free to browse this book, or read it straight through. It covers the information that you might cover in an introductory College Biology course and more. So let's be curious and investigate life.

===How do we know what we know?===

When we are first learning about the world, we learn by asking. We ask our parents, other adults, and older children. This is how we learn to read. This is how we learn the names of things. We ask someone called an &lt;b&gt;authority&lt;/b&gt; who tells us the answer.

But there is another way to learn about the world.  We can ask questions and try to answer them ourselves through observation and deduction. We can lift a rock to see the earthworm that lives under it.

===What is Science?===

Science is a way of finding out about the world by asking questions and trying to answer them by testing and observing. By devising experiments and looking at the results, we can get closer to the truth about how the world works. If experiments do not support one explanation, we find a new one.

Scientists believe that direct observation trumps authority. If the facts do not support a belief, we discard it in favor of one that the evidence does support. So scientific ideas are always in flux changing as our understanding of the world changes. 

===How do you do Science?===
Scientists find out about the world by experimenting and interpreting the results. This way of testing is sometimes formalized into something called &lt;b&gt;The Scientific Method&lt;/b&gt;.

In the Scientific Method one begins with a question. 

'''Scientific Method'''
* Ask a '''Question'''.
* Make a '''Hypothesis''' (an educated guess).
* '''Devise an Experiment''' (one where you've make predictions).
* Perform the Experiment and view the '''Results'''.
* Come to a '''Conclusion''' about what it means.
* If the hypothesis is not proven, go back to step 2 and make a '''new hypothesis'''.

These simple steps allow scientists to build up a body of proven facts about the universe and how  it works. When a hypothesis has been proven by many, many experiments, we can call it a '''scientific theory'''. Some useful and well proven scientific theories are called '''natural laws'''.

==What is Life?==

There isn't just one thing that separates living things from nonliving things. A cat moves but so does a car.  A tree grows bigger, but so does a cloud. A cell has structure, but so does a crystal. In fact if you ask someone how to tell living things from nonliving things, many people would be at a loss. They would say, &lt;i&gt;&quot;You just know&quot;&lt;/i&gt;.

Defining life is complicated. Biologists define life by listing characteristics that living things share. Something that has all of the characteristics of life (not just one or two) is considered to be alive. It is the study of living characteristics.

===What characteristics do living things share?===
An individual living creature is called an &lt;b&gt;organism&lt;/b&gt;.
There are many characteristics that living creatures share.

Living organisms ...
* Respond to environmental changes.
* Grow and develop.
* Can reproduce and have offspring.
* Use energy and have a complex chemistry (metabolism).
* Maintain themselves in a stable state (homeostasis).
* Are built of structures called cells.
* Evolve biologically.

====Respond to environmental changes====
If you step on a rock, it will just lie there, but if you step on a turtle, it may move or even snap at you. Living things know what is going on around them, and respond to changes in the environment. In other words, living organisms are capable of responding to stimuli.

====Grow and develop====
A seed may look like a pebble, but under the right conditions it will sprout and form a seedling that will grow into a larger plant. Growth refers to the process by which the organism increases in size and the number of cells increases. In other words, growth produces more or larger cells. Development, on the other hand, is a change in specific structures. For example, a fertilized egg develops specialized structures such as organs. 

====Can reproduce and have offspring====
Living things make more organisms like themselves.  They reproduce sexually or asexually (cloning). Whether the organism is a rabbit, or a tree, or a bacterium, life will make more life.

====Use energy and have a complex chemistry (metabolism)====
A flower has a complicated and beautiful structure. So does a crystal. But if you look closely at the crystal, you see no change. The flower, on the other hand, is transporting water through its petals, producing pigment molecules, breaking down sugar for energy, and undergoing a large number of other chemical reactions that are needed for living organisms to stay alive. We call the sum of the chemical reactions in a cell its [[Biology%2C_Answering_the_Big_Questions_of_Life/Metabolism |''metabolism'']].

As another example, humans, ''Homo sapiens'', eat to fuel their cells. The food they consume provides cells with chemical energy.

====Maintain themselves in a stable state (homeostasis)====
A human body has a temperature of about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (or approximately 37 degrees Celsius). If you step outside on a wintery morning, the temperature might be below freezing. You, however, don't just become an icecube. You shiver and eat and do what you have to to keep your body temperature the same. Living organisms keep themselves in a stable state. This is called ''homeostasis''. 

====Are built of structures called cells====
If you look closely at any organism you can see that it is made of structures called [[Biology%2C_Answering_the_Big_Questions_of_Life/Cells |cells]]. Organisms that are very different such as ferns, and fish, and elephants all look very similar at the level of the cell. All living organisms are made of one or more cells.

====Evolve biologically====
Biological evolution refers to the change of inherited characteristics within a population over generations. Organisms often adapt to their environment which causes, in the long run, their characteristics to evolve.

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|ref}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|ref}} keyword explicitely specifies that a variable should be passed ''by reference'' rather than ''by value''.

A developer may wish to pass a variable by reference particularly in case of [[C Sharp Programming/Variables#Types|value types]]. If a variable is passed by reference, only a pointer is sent to a function in reality, reducing the cost of a method call in case it would involve copying large amounts of data, something C# does when normally passing value types.

Another common reason to pass a variable by reference is to let the called method modify its value. Because this is allowed, C# always enforces specifying that a value is passed by reference even in the method call, something many other programming languages don't. This let developers reading the code easily spot places that can imply a type has had its value changed in a method, which is useful when analyzing the program flow.

Passing a value by reference does not imply that the called method ''has'' to modify the value; see the {{C sharp/kw|out|{{C sharp|out}}}} keyword for this.

Passing by reference requires the passed variable to be initialized.

An example of passing a variable by reference follows:

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|void}} CallingMethod()
 {
    {{C sharp/kw|int}} i = 24;
    {{C sharp/kw|if}} (DoubleIfEven({{C sharp/kw|ref}} i))
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;i was doubled to {0}&quot;, i); // outputs &quot;i was doubled to 48&quot;
 }
 
 {{C sharp/kw|bool}} DoubleIfEven({{C sharp/kw|ref}} {{C sharp/kw|int}} iValue)
 {
   {{C sharp/kw|if}} (iValue%2 == 0)
   {
     iValue *= 2;
     {{C sharp/kw|return}} {{C sharp/kw|true}};
   }
   {{C sharp/kw|return}} {{C sharp/kw|false}};
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|is}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|is}} keyword compares an object to a type, and if they're the same or of the same &quot;kind&quot; (the object [[C Sharp Programming/Inheritance|inherits]] the type), returns {{C sharp/kw|true|{{C sharp|true}}}}. The keyword is therefore used to check for type compatibility, usually before ''casting'' (converting) a source type to a destination type in order to ensure that won't cause a type-cast exception to be thrown. Using {{C sharp|is}} on a {{C sharp/kw|null|{{C sharp|null}}}} variable always returns {{C sharp/kw|false|{{C sharp|false}}}}.

This code snippet shows a sample usage:

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|readonly}} keyword is closely related to the {{C sharp/kw|const|{{C sharp|const}}}} keyword at a glance, with the exception of allowing a variable with this modifier to be initialized in a constructor, along with being associated with a class instance (object) rather than the class itself.

The primary use for this keyword is to allow the variable to take on different values depending on which constructor was called, in case the class has many, while still ensuring the developer that it can never intentionally or unintentionally be changed in the code once the object has been created.

This is a sample usage, assumed to be in a class called {{C sharp|SampleClass}}:
&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|readonly}} {{C sharp/kw|string}} s;
 
 SampleClass()
 {
   s = &quot;Hello!&quot;;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|out}}

The {{C sharp|out}} keyword explicitly specifies that a variable should be passed ''by reference'' to a method, and set in that method. A variable using this keyword must ''not'' be intialized before the method call to ensure the developer understand its intended effects. Using this keyword requires the called method to set the variable using this modifier before returning. Using {{C sharp/kw|out|{{C sharp|out}}}} also requires the developer to specify the keyword even in the calling code, to ensure that it is easily visible to developers reading the code that the variable will have its value changed elsewhere, which is useful when analyzing the program flow.

An example of passing a variable with {{C sharp/kw|out|{{C sharp|out}}}} follows:

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|void}} CallingMethod()
 {
    {{C sharp/kw|int}} i;
    SetDependingOnTime({{C sharp/kw|out}} i);
    // i is now 10 before/at 12 am, or 20 after
 }
 
 {{C sharp/kw|void}} SetDependingOnTime({{C sharp/kw|out}} {{C sharp/kw|int}} iValue)
 {
   iValue = DateTime.Now.Hour &lt;= 12 ? 10 : 20;
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

The {{C sharp|sizeof}} keyword returns how many bytes an object requires to be stored.

An example usage:
&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|int}} i = 123456;
 
 Console.WriteLine(&quot;Storing i, a {0}, requires {1} bytes, or {2} bits.&quot;,
   i.GetType(), {{C sharp/kw|sizeof}}(i), {{C sharp/kw|sizeof}}(i)*8);
 
 // outputs &quot;Storing i, a System.Int32, requires 4 bytes, or 32 bits.&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|as}}

The {{C sharp|as}} keyword casts an object to a different type. It is therefore similar to the {{C sharp|TypeA varA}} = {{C sharp|(TypeA) varB}} syntax. The difference is that this keyword returns null if the object was of an incompatible type, while the former method throws a type-cast exception in that case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Every morning, a young man wakes up to go to work. He gets ready and then leaves his apartment, which is on the thirteenth floor of an apartment building. He walks out of the elevator and goes to work.

Later that evening, he returns to his apartment building and goes into the elevator. He hates to walk or exercise, however he presses the tenth floor button and walks up the other three stories. 

Why?

Biology is a hands on science, and biology students are usually required to spend some time in the laboratory.

The type of activities a student will perform vary depending on the exact field they are in. Plant geneticist, for example, sometimes spend time out in fields gathering plants, while molecular biologists may use complex equipment such as DNA sequencing machines. Even so, there are some basic techniques that all beginning lab students should understand.

===Basic skills===
* Laboratory safety and understanding warning signs
* Preparation of simple solutions
* Sampling and preparation of samples
* Dissection of plants and animals
* How to clean glassware
* Use of the dissecting scope
* Use of the light microscope
* Making accurate drawings of organisms

==Advanced==
Specialized work places will require other skills. Some skills suggested by subject.

===Anatomy, Botany, and General Biology===
*Use of a microtome to make slides
*staining techniques

.... hope it helped......

===Medical===
* Cell and tissue culture
* Patient sample handling techniques
* Making an accurate white blood cell count
* Antibody testing methods such as ELISA
* Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP)
.....This may also be appropriate under Microbiology

===Microbiology===
* Use of micropipetter
* [[Biology_Laboratory_Techniques/Southern_Blot|Knowledge of Southern and related blotting techniques]]
* Molecular cloning
* Use of restriction enzymes
* Use of PCR ( Polymerase Chain Reaction) machines
* Replica plating
* Growth of competent cells

===Molecular Biology===
* [[Biology_Laboratory_Techniques/Cell_Fractionation|Cell Fractionation]]
* DNA Extraction
* RNA Extraction
* Agarose Gel Electrophoresis
* Polyacrilimide Gel Electrophoresis
* Western Blot



Although books exist to teach these techniques, experienced lab workers have special tricks and techniques that they do not write down. That is why it is best to learn by studying with an experienced lab worker.

'''Dijon mustard''' is a [[Cookbook:Mustard|prepared mustard]] made from husked black or brown mustard seeds, where black seeds are usually considered the strongest and most flavorful. Originally Dijon mustard was blended with [[wikipedia:verjuice|verjuice]], but today's Dijon mustard is usually blended with [[Cookbook:wine|wine]] or [[Cookbook:vinegar|vinegar]]. Additionally [[Cookbook:salt|salt]] and other spices are added to lend it a special spicy flavor. True Dijon mustard is actually pale yellow and not brown. It comes in many additional flavored varieties but also ranges from mild in flavor to the very hot.

Historians are not in agreement as to who actually created the original Dijon mustard recipe, but most do tend to agree that the recipe first appeared in [[wikipedia:Dijon%2C_France|Dijon, France]]; hence the name Dijon mustard.

== Prepositions ==

I think it would be helpful to talk about Russian prepositions and the cases taken by the nouns after the prepositions. And ''movement'' vs. ''stationary''. Please will someone competent in Russian explain this in terms of Latin and German (compare and contrast). It bugs me to no end how language textbook authors assume Russian is the first foreign language learned. ''Not''.[[User:Albertde|Albertde]] 14:50, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

== Russian Word Order ==

Another thing that bugs me is how textbooks don't explain Russian word order beyond the BS that it is ''free''. What they don't tell you is that adjectives ''always'' go before the nouns they modify. Not like English but like Dutch and German. So if English were like Russian we would say: ''From Track three departing train will be late.'' for ''The train departing from track three will be late.''[[User:Albertde|Albertde]] 14:50, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

== Purpose of some of these pages ==
I think there's some discord between the main contents page and this contents page. In the main one, there are articles for each case under Russian/Grammar/Genitive_case, etc, but this contents page has links to Russian/Grammar/Genitive. Is there any reason for this? It seems like an unnecessarily duplication.
Also, I can't seem to find a way to this page, except by going to Genitive_case (or similar) from the main contents page, and then clicking 'grammar' at the top left - so what's the point of this page? In the meantime, I'm going to change the links to match the main contents page, as that has working links. I'm also going to add a link to this page from there.

      <comment>Adding {{WikiProject Languages}}</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

Volgens mij is de volgende zin niet juist. (Hij klink naar Duits.) : (In my opinion, the following sentence is not right. It sounds like German:)
''Ik betwijfel dat je gisteren met de trein naar huis gegaan bent.''

Ik zou liever zeggen : (I would rather say:)
''Ik betwijfel dat je gisteren met de trein naar huis bent gegaan.''[[User:Albertde|Albertde]] 15:14, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

:Sorry for the late answer, but I disagree: for me both orders are correct. (and I'm native)
[[User:152.1.193.137|152.1.193.137]] 21:38, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi, I learnt Flemish first and then Dutch, working at NV Philips in Eindhoven. So I suppose my statement reflects a Southern bias as opposed to the Northern bias in most textbooks.[[User:Albertde|Albertde]]

=== Getting the word order right ===

1. The modals must be explained. 

''Ik denk dat hij op vrijdag zou moeten komen.''

In German, the equivalent of ''zou'' (''wird'') would be put at the end. This is important since a lot of people learning Dutch will either already know German or will go on to learn it after mastering Dutch.

:: ''Ik denk dat hij vrijdag komen zou'' is fine in Dutch. The ''moeten'' part is what sounds awkward.

2. Another topic that ought to be covered is modals and verbs with separable prefixes in independent and dependent clauses.

''Hij zou '''aan''' moeten komen.''

''Ik denk dat hij op vrijdag '''aan''' moet komen.''

::This is a valid point: separables are discussed and so is word order but not the combination. Maybe a revisit?


3. Another topic that is important to written Dutch (and German and Russian for that matter) is that unlike Englsh, adjectives ''always'' go before nouns in Dutch.

''De op tien uur 's zaterdags vertrekkende trein zou worden opgeheven.'' (The train departing at 10 on Saturdays will be cancelled.)[[User:Albertde|Albertde]] 15:14, 10 June 2006 (UTC)

::This is a valid point although I think it probably has more to do with the role of the present participle. In Dutch that is hardly ever used to initiate a clause.</text>

'''Cucumbers''' are plants in the melon family, which are grown for their fruits picked well before maturity. While they are technically fruits (berries), they are commonly referred to as vegetables.

==Description==
Cucumbers are a vining plant that is generally grown on &quot;hills&quot; or on trellises. Numerous varieties are available, falling into two main groups: namely the pickling types and the slicing types. 

Some cucumbers (including many &quot;Asian&quot; varieties) are quite long, and require trellising to achieve straight fruits.

==Growing Conditions==
Cucumbers need full sun, a rich soil, and plenty of water. As vining plants, they require either plenty of room for sprawling, or trellises to grow up on.

==Planting==
Planted in rows, hills, or on trellises.

===Hill planting===
Hills are placed 5 ft apart, diameter about 2 ft. Plant 5-6 cucumber seeds or transplants to each hill.

Hills can be made from either rich soils or composts.

===Trellising===

===Row planting===

==Maintenance==
*Use row covers for varieties susceptible to cucumber beetle.
*Ensure adequate irrigation.
*Pick fruits regularly to encourage further production.
*Bury nodes to encourage further rooting.

==Propagation==
By seed only.

==Harvest==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

==Pests and Diseases==

===Fungal Diseases===
Powdery Mildew

===Viral diseases===
Cucumber mosaic virus, vectored by the cucumber beetle.

===Arthropod Pests===
Cucumber beetles

===Vertebrate Pests===

===Environmental Issues===

Hi there. Not  a user yet, though I will shortly sort this out. I have begun populating some of the blank sections with data and correcting a few minors mistakes to keep clarity. James Carson, LL.M. (Hons) (Camb.)

Hello im gareth currently studying law(LLB) started this book when i was doing a-level i think we need to get a good user base and crack on with it as well as maybe sort out some wikiversity details as UK Law is listed there which doesnt exist. Also i have been using Wiki on a stick to start a law wiki for revision purposes, if there is any intrest i can put it on the server and can prehaps work on that .. hope to get some good work done here with you guys anyway... --[[User:Gaza222|Gaza222]] 01:36, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

==Under a new name: Life in Embrun in 1856==
The new Embrun, Province of Canada was prosperous in 1856 and had a population of 201.

The winter of 1855-56 was a cold winter for the village. The winter was also one of the snowiest on record. The people living by the river knew that the floodwaters would be a terrible problem that spring.

And it was. As the snow melted, runoff from the land caused the river to swell and overflow into the riverside parts of the village and form a band of water so thick it was almost a lake. The 'river-dwellers' had by now learned to evacuate the area during flood season. But the 1856 flood came on so fast that many of the 'river-dwellers' didn't have time to evacuate. 5 'river-dwellers' died and two homes collapsed. The dock, which now was used only for scenic purposes as the boats stopped running in 1854, broke in the massive floodwaters.

When May came, the swelled river finally showed signs of receding, and by May 14th the river was back at normal levels. The entire town worked at rebuilding the homes, but didn't bother rebuilding the dock.

The summer brought prosperity. Shops were now popping up in the town, ran by citizens of Embrun who didn't want to work in the lumber industry. By July there was a blacksmith, a general store, a cabinet maker's store and many more. Embrun was becoming more self-sufficient and less reliant on bigger cities such as Cornwall or Bytown (which by now was called Ottawa).

Also, there were a few farmers that worked in fields and raised livestock in the deforested parts of the countryside around Embrun. These farmers provided food for the village. These farms were run by people who didn't want to work in shops or in the lumber industry. However, agriculture was not a large industry in Embrun.

==Under a new name: Embrun from 1856-1867==
Embrun continued to prosper through 1856, 1857, and 1858. It wasn't until 1859 that the prosperity looked as though it might be going down the drain.

In 1859, lumbermen had to walk for 30 minutes to get from their homes in the town to the edge of the trees due to deforestation. It took even longer at the end of the day due to the fact that they had to transport several chopped trees back to the town. It could take them almost 1 hour at the end of the day to get back to Embrun.

Many citizens advocated an attempt to get another industry. Many lumbermen were simply giving up their job due to the long travel times. Nearly half of Embrun's lumbermen gave up on their job in 1859.

In the spring of 1860, the lumbermen decided to start chopping wood to the south, a direction in which the lumbermen had not yet tried. However, the Castor River was blocking the way. So, they built a bridge across the river.

With the lumber industry saved, Embrun felt more confident. However, their role as the only major town in the area was gone. The town of Casselman was by now growing, although it was not as big as Embrun. However, Embrun took little interest in this growing community. The citizens of Embrun had more pressing matters on their mind than Casselman.

In 1864, the Saint Augustine-de-Catherine road, which still kept its original name, was rebuilt to be twice as wide, which enabled more lumber carts to travel on it at once, making lumber export easier.

In February 1866, Embrun's population reached 1,000 and a French-language journal, ''Le Village'' started publication in May 1866. An English version of the paper, with the same title, started publication in September of that year.

The lining of a joint has three cell types.  One secretes, one absorbs and a third creates a envelope. A cystic mass which emerges from the distal interphalangeal joint is known as a mucous cyst.  These lesions emerge from the joint.  One theory as to their origin has it that an envelope cell most likely undergoes an metaplasia and begins to function as a fluid producing cell, but due to its location on the surface of the joint the fluid thereby generated produces an extra-articular mass.  A breakdown of apoptosis with persistence of a cell leading to errors in genetic expression might be responsible for such a scenario, though what factors might influence this seeming desire of the cell to persist when it should desist making room for new cells is unknown.  The treatment is to remove the offending cells and thereby eliminate the cyst.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An axiomatic development of trees is very important for their systematic study.

There are two fundamental definitions of trees in use: a set-theoretic one and a graph-theoretic one.  They are not equivalent.  The graph-theoretic definition calls trees &quot;graphs without cycles&quot; or &quot;graphs with unique paths between vertices&quot;.  In set theory, a tree is just a set with a partial order such that there is always a &quot;least element&quot;; you can conceive a tree in this definition which does not fit the graph theoretic definition.

In what follows, I take the middle road.  I define trees constructively, but in the same abstract way as defines almost every inductive set in algebra.  By eschewing to view trees as subsets of graph I am, of course, neglecting some very important conclusions about the relationship of trees to other kinds of graphs; but the narrow definition as it is presented here maintains focus on the fundamental properties of trees.  To compensate, a short section at the beginning introduces the graph-theoretic definition of the trees we will be studying. 

= Trees as graphs =
The kinds of trees described below are '''directed graphs'''.  They are '''rooted''': that is, there is an element from which all elements eventually stem and to which no elements go.  (The general definition of a graph-theoretic tree applies also, viz., a tree is a graph with no cycles).

and while I'm here, it would be a good idea to add {{tlx|mbox}} CSS classes too. It's for the best, since once these are in, you can construct them more like the original messageboxes. [[User:ViperSnake151|ViperSnake151]] ([[User talk:ViperSnake151|talk]]) 16:11, 11 August 2008 (UTC)

:I've updated your proposed CSS. I think doing it like I've updated it, would allow templates to be used across namespaces, without anything needing to be changed from the user's perspective, which makes it easier to use. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:51, 11 August 2008 (UTC)
::So is this ready to go? If so, perhaps Darklama would take care of it. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:04, 3 September 2008 (UTC)

== TOClimit ==

To allow TOClimit settings, as discussed at [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance/Archives/2008/June#Templates_TOCleft.2C_TOCright.2C_and_TOClimit_not_working_as_needed_-_Probably_needs_an_admin_to_fix fixing the common css file]], the following needs to be added to this file
&lt;pre&gt;/* Allow limiting of which header levels are shown in a TOC; &lt;div class=&quot;toclimit-3&quot;&gt;, for
   instance, will limit to showing ==headings== and ===headings=== but no further (as long as
   there are no =headings= on the page, which there shouldn't be according to the MoS). */
.toclimit-2 .toclevel-2 {display:none;}
.toclimit-3 .toclevel-3 {display:none;}
.toclimit-4 .toclevel-4 {display:none;}
.toclimit-5 .toclevel-5 {display:none;}
.toclimit-6 .toclevel-6 {display:none;}
.toclimit-7 .toclevel-7 {display:none;}
&lt;/pre&gt;
I guess it might be sensible to add the preceding 13 lines too, i.e.:
&lt;pre&gt;/* When &lt;div class=&quot;nonumtoc&quot;&gt; is used on the table of contents, the ToC will display without numbers */
.nonumtoc .tocnumber { display:none; }
.nonumtoc #toc ul,
.nonumtoc .toc ul {
    line-height: 1.5em;
    list-style: none;
    margin: .3em 0 0;
    padding: 0;
}
.nonumtoc #toc ul ul, 
.nonumtoc .toc ul ul { 
    margin: 0 0 0 2em; 
}&lt;/pre&gt; [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 00:30, 14 December 2008 (UTC)

== Diff style ==

Hello, we have noticed that after the [[mw:MediaWiki 1.20/wmf1|deployment of MediaWiki 1.20wmf1]] an old local customised diff style has not been removed from this page. 1.20 brings a new, greatly improved diff style which is no longer compatible with older customisations. To prevent the new release from worsening rather than improving your diffs, a global interface editor has agreed to help you by removing the old code in a week from now unless you object. You'll then be able to see if the new style suits you or needs a new customisation. I hope this helps, [[User:Nemo bis|Nemo bis]] ([[User talk:Nemo bis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nemo bis|contribs]]) 20:54, 5 August 2012 (UTC)
:I doubt anyone will complain, although you may find the change gets made locally by a sysop anyway - thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:06, 5 August 2012 (UTC)

== External links icons removed ==

&lt;div lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; class=&quot;mw-content-ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello! If this CSS adds or modifies icons shown after external links, you'll be interested in knowing that such icons have been [[gerrit:123817|removed from MediaWiki core]], a change which will reach this wiki in [[wikitech:Deployment|few days]]. You may want to consider whether you still need them. If you have questions, please ask at [[bugzilla:63725]]. Regards, [[m:User:Nemo_bis|Nemo]] 09:45, 10 April 2014 (UTC)
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; from an interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''convex'' if for every &lt;math&gt;K \subset\subset I&lt;/math&gt; and any affine function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi \le f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\partial K&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\phi \le f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued function on an interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;. The following are equivalent:
*(a) &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is convex.
*(b) The difference quotient
*:&lt;math&gt;{\phi(x + h) - f(x) \over h}&lt;/math&gt; increases as &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; does.
*(c) If &lt;math&gt;d\mu \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; and is supported by a compact set &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int d\mu = 1&lt;/math&gt;, then we have: for any &lt;math&gt;x:K \to I&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int x(t)d\mu(t)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.
*:&lt;math&gt;\phi \left( \int x(t)d\mu(t) \right) \le \int \phi \circ x(t)d\mu(t)&lt;/math&gt; (Jensen's inequality)
*(d) If the interval &lt;math&gt;[a, b] \subset I&lt;/math&gt;, then
*:&lt;math&gt;\phi ((1 - \lambda) a + \lambda b) \le (1 - \lambda) \phi(a) + \lambda \phi(b)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;.
*(e) &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is integrable on &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.

Proof: Suppose (a). For each &lt;math&gt;x \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt;, there exists some &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x = \lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;A(x) = A(\lambda a + (1-\lambda) b) = \lambda f(a) + (1-\lambda) f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, and then since &lt;math&gt;\mbox{b}[a, b] = \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(f - A)(a) = 0 = (f - A)(b)&lt;/math&gt;,
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;|f(x)| = |f(x) - A(x) + A(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le \sup \{|f(a) - A(a)|, |f(b) - A(b)|\} + A(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=\lambda f(a) + (1-\lambda) f(b)&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Thus, (a) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (b). Now suppose (b). Since &lt;math&gt;\lambda = {x - a \over b - a}&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;, (b) says:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;(b - x)f(x) + (x - a)f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le (b -x)f(a) + (x - a)f(b)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{f(a) - f(x) \over a - x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le {f(b) - f(x) \over b - x}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Since &lt;math&gt;a - x &lt; b - x&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude (b) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (c). Suppose (c). The continuity follows since we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h &gt; 0, h \to 0}f(x + h) = f(x) + \lim_{h &gt; 0, h \to 0}h{f(x + h) - f(x) \over h}&lt;/math&gt;.
Also, let &lt;math&gt;x = 2^{-1}(a + b)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;a, b \in K&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;{f(a) - f(x) \over a - x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le {f(b) - f(x) \over b - x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f(x) - f(a)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le f(b) - f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f \left( {a + b \over 2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le {f(a) + f(b) \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Thus, (c) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (d). Now suppose (d), and let &lt;math&gt;E = \{ (x, y) : x \in [a, b], y \ge f(x) \}&lt;/math&gt;. First we want to show
:&lt;math&gt;f\left({1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^n} x_j \right) \le {1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^n} f(x_j)&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the inequality holds trivially.
if the inequality holds for some &lt;math&gt;n - 1&lt;/math&gt;, then
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f \left( {1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^n} x_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=f \left( {1 \over 2} \left( {1 \over 2^{n - 1}} \sum_1^{2^{n - 1}} x_j + {1 \over 2^{n - 1}} \sum_1^{2^{n - 1}} x_{2^{n - 1} + j} \right) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le {1 \over 2} f \left( {1 \over 2^{n - 1}} \sum_1^{2^{n - 1}} x_j \right) + {1 \over 2} f \left( {1 \over 2^{n - 1}} \sum_1^{2^{n - 1}} x_{2^{n - 1} + j} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le {1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^{n - 1}} f(x_j) + {1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^{n - 1}} f(x_{2^{n - 1} + j}) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= {1 \over 2^n} \sum_1^{2^n}f(x_j)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Let &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2 \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a sequence of rationals number such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{j \to \infty} {p_j \over 2q_j} = \lambda&lt;/math&gt;.
It then follows that:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda x_1 + (1 - \lambda) x_2)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\le \lim_{j \to \infty} {p_j \over 2q_j} f(x_1) + \left( 1 - {p_j \over 2q_j} \right) f(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \lambda f(x_1) + (1 - \lambda) f(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\le \lambda y_1 + (1 - \lambda) y_2&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
Thus, (d) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (e). Finally, suppose (e); that is, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is convex. Also suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is an interval for a moment. Then
:&lt;math&gt;f(\lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b) \le \lambda f(a) + (1 - \lambda) f(b)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

I think examples that don't use objects would be easier for a beginning programmer to understand.
whats wrong with using statements like:
    String myString = &quot;Hello World&quot;;

cheers

== String usage example ==
A program that uses strings will at some point use Input and Output so to make things easy I'm going to write a simple program to explain it.
    public static void main(){
       String myString = &quot;Hello World&quot;;          // stores the string &quot;Hello World&quot; in the myString variable
       System.out.println(myString);            // prints out myString to the screen     
       System.out.println(&quot;like my program?&quot;);  // This will also print a string to the screen
    }

'''Exercise''' 

Write a program with System.out.println(); and System.out.print(); and see if it makes any difference.</text>

Film is an expensive medium and filmmaking a time-consuming process, therefore conservation and efficiency are paramount. A '''slating procedure''' is an agreed shooting protocol adopted by a film production crew to ensure that recording begins just before the action starts, and ends immediately after action stops. A good ''slating procedure'' helps keep film costs down to a minimum by optimising communication between relevant departments during a take.
The following example is a typical ''slating procedure'' based on current film-industry practise, however each production office determines its own style: 

== Typical Slating Procedure ==

*'''Step 1:''' The assistant director (&quot;1AD&quot;) calls into the walkie-talkie: &quot;''This is picture!''&quot;, which tells the crew that a take is about to begin. 
*'''Step 2:''' The 1AD calls &quot;''Quiet please!''&quot; followed by &quot;''Stand by''&quot;, after which ''everyone'' is expected to be absolutely silent. 
*'''Step 3:''' The 1AD calls &quot;''Roll sound''&quot;. This alerts the production sound mixer (&quot;SM&quot;) to start recording the sound.
*'''Step 4:''' The SM starts the sound recorder, voice slates the ''scene'' and ''take'' number, and then calls &quot;''Speed''&quot;. This indicates that recording has started and the SM is ready for the new ''take'' to begin.
*'''Step 5:''' The 1AD calls &quot;''Roll camera''&quot;. This alerts the camera operator (&quot;CO&quot;) to start recording the picture.
*'''Step 6:''' The CO starts the camera and then calls &quot;''Speed''&quot; to the 1AD and &quot;''Mark it''&quot; to the 2AC.
*'''Step 7:''' The second assistant camera (&quot;2AC&quot;) holds up the clapperboard in clear view of the camera, with clapsticks open, and marks the shot by calling &quot;''Marker''&quot; just before clapping the clapsticks.  On some productions, the 2AC might also give a ''second'' voice slate before clapping the sticks.
*'''Step 8:''' The film director (&quot;D&quot;) starts the action by calling &quot;''Action''&quot;. The take begins.
*'''Step 9:''' The D stops the action by calling &quot;''Cut''&quot;. If the take is successful then the D calls &quot;''Print''&quot;, otherwise &quot;''Retake''&quot;. 
*'''Step 10:''' Steps 1 to 9 are repeated until the 1AD calls &quot;''New deal''&quot; for a new camera angle, &quot;''Next set''&quot; for a new stage setting, or &quot;''That's a wrap''&quot; to end the day's shooting.

'''Key''' 
* 1AD = First Assistant Director
* 2AC = Second Assistant Camera (or Clapper-Loader)
* SM = Sound Mixer
* CO = Camera Operator
* D = Director</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''crowbar circuit''' is a method of protecting a circuit against high voltages (overvoltage) in the event of a power supply malfunction or power surge. This is especially useful in a device using TTL components as these are very sensitive to overvoltage. However, there are many other devices which can be damaged by overvoltage.

A crowbar circuit works by sensing a voltage that is above a certain threshold and shorting out the power supply. This causes a voltage drop in the rest of the circuit and current surge through the power supply that will trip a circuit-breaker or blow a fuse. The circuit must have a fuse or circuit-breaker, as without it the power supply or the crowbar circuit will be damaged. Crowbar circuits are so named because their activation is similar in effect to dropping a crowbar across bus bars (heavy duty power supply lines).

A typical crowbar circuit is as follows:

[[image:Crowbar Circuit.svg|center|400px]]

This crowbar circuit has an 8V power supply, and triggers at 9.1V. To change the power supply rating, the [[Practical_Electronics/Zener diode|zener diode]], ZD1, needs to be changed to reflect the new trigger voltage. It should be about 1V higher than the nominal supply voltage.

*Fuse F1 is the fuse that blows if the current drawn by the circuit exceeds 250mA. This can be increased as needed, but make sure the thyristor Q1 has a higher current rating than the fuse. Typically this fuse is a resettable fuse.

*Capacitor C1's purpose is to reduce small, harmless, voltage spikes or noise which may trigger the circuit.

*ZD1 is the Zener diode which detects the overvoltage condition. At the trigger voltage (here 9.1V), its resisitance decreases suddenly, bringing the junction with R1 and the gate of Q1 high. 

*R1 is a pull-down resistor which holds the gate of thyristor Q1 low when ZD1 is not triggered. Its other function is to provide a voltage difference for capacitor C2 to &quot;snub&quot; Q1 with. Without this, the capacitor would be shorted out and useless.

*C2 is a snubber capacitor to prevent the thyristor being triggered by accident on being powered up. It must have a value high enough to snub Q1, but low enough so that the residual charge does not cause a transient &quot;high&quot; state at the gate of Q1 when powered up.

*Q1 is the [[thyristor]] which is turned on by ZD1's breakdown. This provides a short-circuit between the power rails, blowing the fuse.

*SD1 is a Schottky diode to prevent capacitances in the main circuit triggering the crowbar circuit. Normal diodes can be used, but they have a larger voltage drop than Schottky diodes.

This outline will serve to fill a hole in available material here on wikibooks. I would like this book to be a precursor to the [[Cellular Automata]] book, and as the necessary companion material to other books on periphery topics such as [[Compiler construction]], etc. Also, this would serve as a good theoretical basis for my future book on Lex and Yacc. 

I intend to shelve this book on the mathematics bookshelf, even though I am well aware that most of the uses of Automata theory will be found on the CS bookshelf. 

== Introduction ==

This book is going to consider the topic of Automata Theory, Sequential Machines, and Artificial Languages. The goal of this book is to become a solid foundational work for topics that are based off the automata theory framework.

}}

This tutorial will show you how to make advanced terrain such as mountains using Blender and gimp or any other image editing software. Blender has the ability to use height maps to create meshes. Height maps are black and white images with white representing the highest point and black the lowest. 
  
== Creating the heightmap image ==

'''Note:''' This entire Tutorial presumes that you are already familiar with other Editing Software, such as GIMP... and already know how to create &quot;textures&quot; with that software. However, you do not have to use another program to obtain a texture. At the end of the next section, they show you how to generate a random 'cloud' texture which you can use directly. Do not worry about GIMP or Photoshop. Just skip the rest of this section and most of the next one. 

To begin with, open your image editing software. This part applies to Gimp only (downloadable at http://gimp.org), if you use another program you will have to do it another way.

First use the &quot;New&quot; menu option to create an image 1600 wide by 1200 tall. Go to '''Filters''' &amp;rarr; ''Render'' &amp;rarr; ''Clouds'' &amp;rarr; ''Plasma'' (In Photoshop, this is Filter &gt; Render &gt; Clouds). For this example just use the default settings, it doesn't really matter. Click OK. You should now have a nice colorful image. We don't want that, we want it in black and white. Make sure your Gradient is set to &quot;FG to BG(RGB)&quot;(this is the default anyway) and that your foreground color is black and the background color is white. Go to '''Colors''' → ''Map'' &amp;rarr; ''Gradient Map''. This will convert it to black and white for you. 

Save your image as PNG or JPEG.

It should look something like this

[[File:Blender heightmap screenshot.png|800px]]

== Create grid and add the image as texture ==
Open Blender and delete the default cube.

Add a grid ('''SPACE''' &amp;rarr; ''Add'' &amp;rarr; ''Mesh'' &amp;rarr; ''Grid'') with resolutions 32 and 32 from top view. Do not scale the grid just yet, zoom instead if you wish to take a closer look at your grid. It will be explained later why you shouldn't scale now.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'''Note''': When I followed this tutorial it didn't work - the vertices in the grid were moving sideways rather than vertically.  It turns out I needed to '''TAB''' into object mode after creating the grid, then hit '''CTRL+AKEY''' to reset the transformation, then '''TAB''' back into edit mode.  If someone could explain why that was necessary, or what it does exactly, that would be helpful.
|}

:*'''Response 1''': You should create the basic shape and outline in object mode, then edit the details in edit mode, kinda like the names imply.
:*'''Response 2''': When you create an object using the Front or Side views while having '''Aligned to View''' selected in the '''Edit Methods''' in '''Blender Settings Panel''', the Local Z axis of the object will be pointing to the Global Y or X axis, respectively. For the matter of this tutorial, if you do that, you'll be forced to rotate the object 90º in X or Y, before going on. That's where problems may begin, if you rotate it in '''Edit Mode''' which doesn't change local axis orientations. In that case you'll be forced to reset transformations ('''Ctrl+A''' -&gt; '''Scale and Rotation to ObData'''). However, if you rotate it in '''Object Mode''', and if you make sure the Local Z axis points upwards after the rotation, you should be seeing good results later on. ''( To see the Local orientations of an object, Press '''F7''' for the '''Object Panel''' (the one with three arrows, 4th from the left) and in the '''Draw''' pane click the '''Axis''' button.)''


Click '''F5''' to go to the ''Shading panel''. By default the ''Material buttons'' button should be selected (button with red ball), but if it isn't then click on it.
If this window has a panel named ''Preview'' and it is empty then look to the right for the ''Links and Pipeline'' panel. Here you should find an ''Add New'' button beneath ''Link to Object'', click on it. 3 more panels should appear when you do this. You should find the ''Texture buttons'' button, it is just to the right of the ''Material button'' and is black &amp; yellow. You may also just hit '''F6'''. Now you should get two new panels titled ''Preview'' and ''Texture'', in the ''Texture'' panel you'll find an ''Add new'' button, click it. Where the button just was it should now be a text field saying something like &quot;TE:Tex.001&quot;, click in the text field and write &quot;height&quot; instead. Look a bit to the right and down for a dropdown menu allowing you to choose ''Texture Type'', click it and select ''Image''. Two more panels will appear and the rightmost should be ''Image'' with a ''Load'' button.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'''Note:''' The ''Texture buttons'' button is not part of the windows that pop up after you click ''Add New'' button, but it directly to the right of the ''Material'' button that is a red ball.
|}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'''Note:''' If you can't find the ''Texture Type'' menu, press '''F6'''. Once you press '''F6''', or the ''Texture buttons'' button, you'll see another panel, also called ''Texture''.  This one, however, shows a ''Texture Type'' menu after you select ''Add new''.  Having two very similar panels can be a nasty trap.
|}

Before you load the image take a look at the ''Map Image'' panel. About in the middle there should be 5 buttons, ''Extend'', ''Clip'', ''ClipCube'', ''Repeat'' and ''Checker''. Select ''Clip'' or your heightmap may wrap around the grid (if this doesn't make sense then do this tutorial twice, one where you keep ''Repeat'' selected and one without. In that case make sure there's some bright white spots in your height map on each edge).

Click the ''Load'' button and load the heightmap you just created in your favourite image editing software.

'''If you're going for the random cloud-type image, though, you can make it from within Blender itself - when you add a texture, in the menu where you select 'image,' before actually selecting it, pick 'clouds' instead, and play with the settings.'''

[[Image:Blender3d-heightmap-1.jpg|800px]]

Click the ''Material buttons'' button again (the red ball button) and look in the ''Preview'' panel. If this just shows a black ball then click on the uppermost button just to the right of the black ball.

[[Image:Blender3d-heightmap-2.png|800px]]

== Use texture as heightmap ==

(Blender 2.5+ note: Now you do this using a &quot;Displace&quot; modifier that applies the Texture you created.)

Look to the top right of the rightmost panel, the window should have 3 panes titled ''Texture'', ''Map Input'' and ''Map To''. Click on the ''Map To'' pane. A whole lot of buttons will appear:
* Turn off the ''Col'' button.  &quot;Col&quot; stands for &quot;color,&quot; and we don't want our plane to be ''colored'' by this texture.
* All of these buttons should be turned off:  we're not going to be using this texture to &quot;Map To&quot; anything.  Instead, we'll be using it to deform the actual geometry.

Go to the ''Edit window'' ('''F9''') and enter edit mode ('''TAB''') if you're in ''Object Mode''. Go to either front or side view so you can see what you are doing. Click the ''Noise'' button in the ''Mesh Tools''-panel (it's located in the top left corner of this panel) and your grid should start to change shape. 

'''Note:''' make sure all your vertices are selected with AKEY or whatever you want to use to select.  If not selected, ''Noise'' won't do anything!

* ''(While you could, theoretically, use this to your advantage ... intentionally de-selecting vertices that you don't want to influence ... in practice that's quite awkward if for some reason you have to do it again.  It's much easier to leave any such areas, that you don't want to influence, &quot;completely white&quot; in the image.)''

[[File:Blender-landscape with height maps.png|800px]]

Continue clicking the button until the terrain has reached the height you want and voilà, you have just made terrain using heightmaps. You may want to subsurf the shape to get a smoother effect.
If you wish to scale your new landscape then now is the time. There seems to be a bug or gotcha causing your heightmap to be tiled on your grid rather than resized if you scale the grid before applying the heightmap. Hopefully someone familiar with blender will clarify how this should be done properly, but until then this method will work.

[[File:Blender-landscape with height maps(1).png|800px]]

Tips:

1.If you want a more jagged landscape then adjust the contrast on the image editing software

2.Once you've finished using the ''Noise'' button in the ''Mesh Tools'' panel as shown above, the texture is no longer needed:  the effect it has made on the geometry of the object is permanent.  If texture-resources are tight, you can remove it now.  But it's advisable to keep it, unchanged, in case you need to re-do your work at some time in the future.  If you want to use other kinds of texture-maps (''Col''or, ''Nor''mal maps, and so-forth), you can use the landscape-image as a handy reference (say in a background-layer in your painting program) for correct placement of these features, but you should not alter the landscape-image itself). 

3.Height maps can also be used to make city terrain. Draw white squares on a black background. If you do this make sure you make the squares perfectly parallel to the sides of the image. This prevents jagged edges to buildings. You can also use gray squares to adjust the buildings to different heights.

4.The &quot;Noise&quot; mesh-editing button displaces vertices in the object's Z-Axis and negative Z-Axis only. To deform your mesh's other dimensions, simply rotate your object and &quot;apply rotation,&quot; or rotate the vertices in edit mode, and apply Noise. Then, rotate it back again to get your original orientation.

5.The &quot;Noise&quot; button permanently modifies your mesh according to the material texture. Each click adds onto the current mesh. For a temporary effect, map the texture to ''Disp''(lacement) for a render-time effect ''(and do not click the &quot;Noise&quot; button at all)''. In object/edit mode your object will appear normal, but will render deformed.

6.''Note:'' The &quot;Noise&quot; mesh-editing ''button,'' as used here, is not the same as the &quot;Noise&quot; ''texture'' that is referred to in other tutorials!

* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* 2 cups whipping cream
* 1/2 tsp. Dijon mustard


==Procedure==

#In a 12&quot; non-stick skillet, heat the butter over a med-high heat until foaming.
#Add the morels and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 min. until slightly crispy.
#Add the onion tops, parsley, nutmeg, pepper and salt and cook for a few minutes
#Turn heat to higher and wine and reduce to almost a glaze
#Turn heat to med. and add the cream and mustard. Reduce slightly over slow boil until thickened- about 10-12 min.
#Serve.


Recipe for 4 persons. To make these really grand dishes, add 20-24 nice-sized boiled shrimp to sauce before servin

=Grandmother's Morel Recipe =

==Ingredients==
* A batch of morels
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup milk
* 2 cups cornmeal
* 1 tsp. black pepper
* Bacon grease

==Procedure==
#Halve, clean and soak the morels then leave overnight in salt water with a heavy plate weighing them down in the water
#Rinse the morels well and drain before cooking
#In a wide shallow bowl mix the egg and milk
#In a thick paper bag mix the cornmeal and pepper
#In a deep well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, melt the bacon grease 1&quot; deep. Get it good and hot but not smoking.
#Now dip your mushrooms in the milk and let them soak a little while your grease is heating.
#Pick a handful out of the bowl and shake them a little to get off some of the liquid excess then drop them in the bag of cornmeal.
#Hold your hand on the bottom of the bag so  it doesn't break, and gently shake.
#Add more mushrooms, shaking gently after each addition. When they are all coated very well, start laying them in a single layer in the hot skillet.
#Try to only turn them once, that way your coating stays on better.
#Don't salt, bacon grease is salty. When golden, drain on paper. 

Being lazy, I gently dump the coated morels in a colander set in a larger bowl. This lets the loose stuff fall off and if you need to touch up any bare spots your coating is right there.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The main title should read Matar Paneer instead of Mateer Paneer. Can somebody help here in changing the title?
==Requested move==
Mateer_Paneer → Matar_Paneer – Spelling Correction
===Survey===
:*'''Support''' 
Matar, which means Peas in India, is the correct spelling , not mateer. You can try searching Matar Paneer and various sites will be shown in the result, whereas Mateer Paneer will not give many. Because 'Matar' is more authentic Indian name for Peas and not Mateer.

===Discussion===
:''Add any additional comments''

I just went ahead and made the move. I'm not sure what language mateer is from, if any, but matar or mattar is the very common name for this dish. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] 11:29, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of this ATALL Wikibook module is to provide a place for &quot;technology-enhanced&quot; language learners and teachers to describe how they use ATALL for their own language learning and/or that of their students. We refer to these descriptions as ATALL '''packages'''.

Each ATALL package may include the following components:
#The '''purpose''' or '''learning objective''' under consideration (e.g., to improve comprehension of rapidly spoken informal speech)
#The '''theoretical and/or empirical foundation(s)''' of the package (e.g., theory and/or research indicating that rapid colloquial speech is more easily understand when accompanied by transcripts or captions)
#A '''review of research''' of any past attempts to use technology for the purpose or learning objective of interest.
#The new '''technology''' used or proposed. This may include hardware (not necessarily computer) and software (e.g., DVD player that allows variable speed playback of standard DVD movies)
#The '''resources''' used (e.g., specific websites, podcasts, Internet videos, DVDs, etc.)
#The '''activities''' undertaken with the technology and resources and how they relate to the theoretical and/or empirical foundation(s) (e.g., (a) reading a transcript of a movie scene and learning unfamiliar word and phrases, (b) playing the movie scene at slower-than-normal speed while reading captions in the original language, (c) playing the scene again at slow speed without the captions, (d) playing the scene at normal speed without the captions).
#The '''outcome(s)''' (e.g., personal accounts of use and results; use by students; learning and/or attitudinal outcomes; systematic and/or anecdotal evaluation of the package)
#Additional '''needs and recommendations''' (e.g. need for new or different resources; additional technology features, etc.)
#'''Conclusion(s)'''

Packages need not contain all of the information outlined above, that is, they need not be &quot;complete packages.&quot;

As these packages are submitted by individuals to describe their own experiences, it would seem best that readers should refrain from editing them (except for minor edits involving spelling, grammar, style, etc.) and restrict comments to the Comments section at the end of each example. Original authors may then revise their package description and remove comments that are no longer relevant. Alternatively, package authors may wish to describe their packages in an external link (for example by preparing it and publishing it using Google Documents &amp; Spreadsheets) and provide its title and link in this module of the ATALL Wikibook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Concerning Permanent Stubs ==

*'''was the majority of the content made by a registered or anonymous user?''' - a large amount of the contributions made to 

wikibooks is contributed by anonymous users. Although they usually contribute useful information, they don't continue to 

contribute (unless they register). 

*'''Is it possible to contact a contributor of the book?''' - any wikibook that has someone who claims to be the editor 

should not be deleted.

*'''Can this book be merged with another wikibook?''' - before attempting to delete a wikibook, an attempt should be made to 

find a book that could be merged with the wikibook in question.
 
*'''When was the last major contribution made to any page of the book?''' - When considering what a permanent stub is, the 

last '''major''' contribution should be considered (which does not include moving a page, fixing spelling errors, adding the 

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{stub}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template, etc).

*'''How large is the book?''' - the larger a book is, the more likely it will not be deleted.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== [[Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine]] ==

I like your new book about nuclear medicine, It's high-quality resources like this that are going to help make wikibooks an excellent resource for future generations of students. I just wanted to make a few quick notes to you. First, wikibooks generally frowns upon putting all sorts of personal information and biographical information on the module pages themselves. Basically, we can't guaruntee that other contributors won't come in and edit your personal information. Also, since the preface of the book is about you, I worry that perhaps it is in violation of policy here. Wikibooks modules need to maintain a &quot;neutral point of view&quot;, and wikibooks can't be used as a personal advertisement vehicle. As such, I highly recommend that you move the biographical information that you have provided about yourself onto your own user page, or onto a talk module.

== Re: Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine ==

Done.

:Wow, that was very quick. I hope i didn't come across as threatening or anything, I certainly didnt intend to. I mostly just wanted to spare your book from future complaints or problems. Like I said above, it is a particularly good book. Good luck in any future projects here, let me know if you need anything. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:15, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

::Just learning the ropes, mate.  Many thanks for the very useful feedback.

== iWheels??? ==

&quot;Willy on Wheels&quot; is the name of a vandal, who uses &quot;sock puppet&quot; accounts to move pages. He is very infamous, and we have been unable to stop him and his vandalism. Let me know which pages got moved, and I will move them back and fix the damage. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:24, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

:Derbeth spotted and fixed it, thanks.--[[User:KieranMaher|KieranMaher]] 23:49, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

== Image licenses ==

Could you add licenses to [[:Image:NM3 11.gif]] and [[:Image:NM7 16.gif]]. Thanks! --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 09:43, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

:Licenses were added to these images by 2 different IP addresses. Was this you? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:03, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

::Both images were generated by me.  I can't remember which IP addresses I would have used.  Sometimes I forget to log in.  But my intention was to put the images into the public domain. [[User:KieranMaher|marz]] 02:24, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

== Thank you for the excerpt ==
Thank you for adding on to my project @ [[Introduction to Physical Science]] I may need to trim it in order to make it grade-level appropriate, but you've saved me a lot of typing, research, and sweat in general. I plan to remove the excerpt note, but your book will be sited as a source and your name will be added to the contributors list, feel free to contact me at my talk page or on one of the books talk pages at any time. I hope you will contribute to IPS again in the future. And if you have any other science-oriented friends, please invite them to join the project!

==Link to Radiation Oncology text==
Very nice textbook. I have taken the liberty to link to it from our RadOnc textbook. So far it's mostly clinical, and the extent of our physics is minimal, so this will come in very handy!
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Radiation_Oncology/Physics
[[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 14:37, 28 August 2006 (UTC)

:Please be aware that the text is very diagnostic focussed, with no explicit therapy references.  Some of the basic physics might be useful, but there's no treatment of important (to oncology) topics such as Pair Production and MIRD.  So, maybe it would be better to treat the link as an introduction to the physical aspects of ''diagnostic'' nucmed. I will place a link to your textbook if that's ok with you. [[User:KieranMaher|marz]] 10:49, 30 August 2006 (UTC)

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:NM3 11.gif]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:NM3 11.gif]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask them at the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]]. Thank you. [[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:31, 4 September 2006 (UTC)

:thanks for this.  I've added pd-self to [[:Image:NM3 11.gif]] and [[:Image:NM7 16.gif]].  Have you spotted any other images that need copyright statements?  [[User:KieranMaher|marz]] 00:28, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

::I'll have a peek later. [[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:54, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

== Images ==

According to my records, you have uploaded at least 3 images that are currently without a copyright tag. The images are:

*[[:Image:NM14_1.gif]]
*[[:Image:NM14_26.gif]]
*[[:Image:LiveImage.jpg]]

Please tag your image with the appropriate copyright tags. If you would like, I can do it for you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:15, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

:Thanks, Whitenight!  I've uploaded new versions of these images (with copyright tags) and the files listed above can now be deleted. [[User:KieranMaher|marz]] 22:14, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

::In the future, you can just add the tags... no need to re-upload them. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:15, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

== Bot ==

I saw your comment about the bots on [[User talk:HDBot]], and I think i can answer your questions. A &quot;bot&quot; is a program that is either automatic or semi-automatic, that is capable of making changes to the database. If we have a program that can send HTTP messages to the server, just like your webbrowser does, we can make the same kinds of edits from that program that we can from a web browser. Some bots can make edits to pages (like my bot), some bots can just read the pages and post alerts (double-redirects, pages that arent categorized, images without licenses, etc), and some bots can make bigger changes like moving or deleting changes. If you have any other questions, just let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:08, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

== Image license issues ==

In the future, please be sure to tag all your uploads with appropriate license information ''before'' it becomes an issue. As well, you can use {{UserImages}} to find images which you have uploaded that are untagged or unlicensed. As well, I replied on my talk page. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:19, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

:As I said, Mike ... I'm still learning [[User:KieranMaher|marz]] 16:39, 28 September 2007 (UTC)

== German translation ==

As you might have realized, a german translation of your book is being worked out. Many people have already been working on it for a long time. As usual we do our best, but cant give any guarantee for it's quality. As we partly need the same images I've dislocated some to commons, so the wikimedia projects can save capacity. Even if you don't know any german you might want to have a look on your german edition:

:Thanks for the update, Yoshi.  Have fun! [[User:KieranMaher|marz]] ([[User talk:KieranMaher|talk]]) 05:08, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== Just hang on ==

I can see you are upset, but equally you can't rescind the license (and therefore just remove) the content from the book. If you want the book deleted, please request it at [[WB:RFD]] and don't just delete all the pages like this. I've blocked you to stop you until a discussion is held. If you agree to allow a discussion to progress via the normal process I'll unblock you straight away  &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:31, 21 April 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and welcome to my userpage. You may know me from the english Wikipedia as [[w:User:The Helper S|The Helper S]] or on Commons as [[commons:User:Covinan|Covinan]]. Please, if you want to find out about me, please see my [[w:User:The Helper S|Wikipedia page]]. Note that here at Wikibooks, I basically will work solely on Wikijunior, but if I find anything interesting on the regular area of Wikibooks, I'll work on it, too. There won't be a current new section like I have on Wikipedia and Commons, but you can still read on what I've done at the other wikis.

I'm active occasionally here, as my main job is at the english Wikipedia but once in a while I'll look around Wikibooks and Wikijunior, though. Right now, I'm on Christmas break, so now I got loads of time!

To shorten things down, like on my english wikipedia page, you can call me the long and register name, or call me the easier acronym (I pride myself in an acronym on Wikipedia sometimes as THS) which is AOC.

Right now, I'm working on the [[Wikijunior Bugs]] project, as well as others in the Wikijunior category.

I've been taking a wikibreak for a long duration of time due to the calling of my unplugged life, so don't be surprised if it seems I'm dead on here, Wikipedia, and Commons. I aim at checking up on Wikibooks and Wikijunior around every month to two months.</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:12, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

== Bugs! ==

Just have to say I so admire the Wikijunior pages compared to some stuff on here.  Also I mentioned to [[User:Urbane_User]] yesterday I run AWB on a bot account so if I can help with categorisation or cleanup etc I happily will - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:08, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Ants Page ==

Great work on the ants page today Avenue of Covina.

Thanks![[User:Avenue of Covina|Avenue of Covina]] 19:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Hi ==

As I have been in touch with you about some bits I hope you won't mind me approaching you about something specific.  While vandalism is not the issue here that it is on Wikipedia we do still have a level of vandalism that needs tackling often by Admins as there are fewer users here than Wikipedia.  One of the tools that allows us to tackle vandals more easily is Checkuser.  This means that we can see the IP address a registered user has vandalised from and see if this may have happened before (it often has).  To get these rights required 25 affirmative votes which on a small wiki is not easy. A hard
working Admin is looking for just two more votes to get this.  If you would like to look at this then go here
[[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#SBJohnny_.28talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.7C_logs. 29]] and you are welcome to vote.  I must stress that you are under no pressure at all to do so and if you decide not to that is fine.  I do hope you do not mind me contacting you in this way - thanks and regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

== Wikijunior Bugs ==

Avenue of Covina,

I would like to propose an alternate layout for the wikijunior bugs page. As you are one of the named authors, i have come to you directly to see what you think of the idea. I have made a mock-up of the proposed layout on my [[User:Urbane_User/Sandbox|personal sandbox]] which can be accessed by clicking this link or through my user page. All of the existing articles and other pages will remain unaltered by this as the only page that will change will be the main bugs page, if it is accepted that is.

I have proposed this new design to increase efficiency and reduce the amount of time that is spent moving articles from the stub list into the developing articles list and so on...

Please take a look and tell me what you think.

Regards,
Urbane User

== Thanks ==

Thanks for the support re: the bugs page. I was unsure whether or not my changes would be to the liking of other editors and im glad that the changes are beneficial.

Thanks again.

== What is Wikijunior ==

[[Wikibooks:Wikijunior:What_is_Wikijunior|What is Wikijunior]]&quot; is proposed as a policy and has been included on the [[Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines/Vote|Wikibooks Policies and Guidelines Voting]] page.

== Wikijunior Study ==

Hello, Avenue of Covina, 
I read the Wikijunior Bug. I'm very impressed and interested to know more about your experience related to this particular book project (Wikijunior Bug) I'm current a doctoral student at Indiana University. My advisor and I, we are starting a Wikibook study regarding to online authors' beliefs and perceptions (motivation to write a Wikibook, beliefs about the knowledge of the topic, previous experience and success in writing a Wikibook, and ability to help coordinate the Wikibook project and interact with other authors). We would love to invite you to participate in this study. Your input to this study will be greatly appreciated. If you agree to participate, please leave me a message or send me an email. (My email is cl17@indiana.edu.) We'll schedule a one hour interview with you at your convenience by phone or by email (email interview). Thank you very much again. Inkeys

==New Contributor==
Hello, Avenue of Covina.  I'm writing to tell you that I've begun contributing to the Wikijunior Bugs project.  I was wondering if you were still working on it.  I've updated the millipede page and plan on working on and cleaning up other articles.

Thanks,

Wes

**Hi Wes, lately I've been busy with many other things so I only check up on Wikibooks in general about every month or two months. I'm glad to hear that you've help contribute to the Wikijunior Bugs! Maybe in time, I might have enough free time to contribute at least a page or two but we'll see what the future holds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Middle Heian Period consists essentially of the 10th century. It covers the restoration of the Fujiwara Regency and the withering away of almost the entire central bureaucracy along with the tax revenues that financed it. The higher aristocracy of the capital financed itself from shoen and provincial governorships and no longer received meaningful salaries. For the first time political events in the countryside have to be taken note of and it is possible to see the first stirrings of the evolution of the future feudal form of government. 

There is little political information for the period from the death of Tokihira in 909 until 930. The early death of Tokihira was only a modest setback to the fortunes of his family; by 914 his brother Tadahira had risen to the highest rank among active officials. Tadahira dominated politics for a very long time, until his death in 949 at the age of 70. He is not associated with any significant initiatives and was well known as a man devoted to the pleasures of aristocratic life. Retired emperor Uda lived until 931 when he died at the age of 65. He outlived his son Emperor Daigo who died in 930. The new emperor was Suzaku Tenno, a child of 8 who obviously required a regent, inevitably his grandfather Tadahira. The leadership group at the time of the reestablishment of the regency included 15 men, 11 of whom were members of the Fujiwara clan, including the 7 highest in rank. There was but one Minamoto, a son of Daigo Tenno. The important developments of this era were occurring in the countryside.

The fact that things were changing in the relationship between the provinces and the capital became obvious between 936 and 941 when two celebrated &quot;rebellions&quot; occurred. The difficulties of moving bulky goods in a mountainous chain of islands with almost no true roads meant that boats were always of the greatest importance and that the most important waterway was always the Inland Sea extending from the area of modern Osaka to the northeast coast of Kyushu. When you hear of security problems in China, it almost always concerns bandits. In Japan, it is usually pirates, and especially pirates in the Inland Sea. In the period between 936 and 941 a man with connections in the capital named Fujiwara Sumitomo organized these pirates into a force powerful enough to cause panic in the capital and the appointment of a general to suppress him. Then, in 940 and 941 there was a simultaneous set of disturbances in eastern Japan, the general area of modern Tokyo, instigated mainly by a man named Taira Masakado, leading to the appointment of a general against him also. There is a well known book, &lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;Shomon&quot; is Masakado pronounced as Chinese, so the title means &quot;History of Masakado&quot;), written by a well-informed contemporary, so quite a lot is known about Masakado and the people in the east with whom he was involved. These two episodes are the precursors of a series of ever more serious disturbances that eventually, two hundred years later, resulted in the loss of power by the old capital nobles and its assumption by men whose power came from relationships in the outer provinces.

After the death of Tadahira there was another lapse of the regency (but not of Fujiwara power). The Fujiwara predominance became so strong, in fact, that from this time the Fujiwara began to subdivide into distinct lineages that eventually acquired new family names to permit people to keep them straight. In this era these new names began to come into use, although only informally. They were geographical names derived from the address of the primary family mansion, and might vary as mansions burned in the frequent fires and were replaced, only becoming fixed in the 13th century.

For most, the absolute epitome of Fujiwara power would be the time of Michinaga, who died in 1027, and that is when I will end the Middle Heian period. 

==Sumitomo's Rebellion==

Fujiwara Sumitomo was the great-grandson of Fujiwara Nagayoshi, the natural father of Mototsune (Mototsune was adopted to continue the main Fujiwara lineage). This meant that he was in fact moderately closely related to the regent Tadahira, who was also descended from Nagayoshi. Sumitomo's father Yoshinori held the rank of governor of Chikuzen and junior deputy commander at Dazaifu. Sumitomo himself was a zuryo who stayed in his province of Iyo when his term ended. Iyo province, on the Shikoku side of the Inland Sea, was the most characteristic pirate base from this era through the 16th century. Sumitomo almost immediately began subordinating pirate bands and turning them into something bigger. He had an island base at Hiburishima off the west end of Iyo. It is said that he controlled 1000 boats. The names of about 30 of his followers are known. All of them had known aristocratic names of the district magistrate class. 

By 936 Sumitomo was troublesome enough that Tadahira appointed a governor to Iyo province who had a specific mandate to suppress piracy and especially Sumitomo. This was Ki no Yoshihito, a man from a family with a tradition of military service. Yoshihito was evidently pretty successful at this and for a time piracy was reduced and Sumitomo's name was not heard. His method appears to have been to put pressure on Sumitomo's subordinates to accept pardons and settle down. He is said to have caused 2,500 men to abandon piracy, and it is from accounts of this that we get the list of names mentioned above. 

It the period after Yoshihito's term as governor of Iyo, Taira no Masakado began to cause problems in the east, taking attention away from Iyo. However, Sumitomo had not gone away and he suddenly became conspicuous again just at the time that the government was beginning to think that something must be done about Masakado. At this time the government offered Sumitomo a pardon if he would surrender, but he ignored them.

In 940 Tadahira appointed 3 men as tsuibushi, each of whom was given a block of provinces within which to raise troops. Two of them were to take their forces east to deal with Masakado and the third was to go after Sumitomo, who was raiding various locales around with Inland Sea with a large fleet. One of Sumitomo's raids was on Awaji island, at the eastern end of the sea, which caused a panic in the capital. Now Tadahira appointed a general who was to raise a substantial army to oppose him. However, Sumitomo's career was ended before this commander could do anything substantial. Sumitomo did not attack the capital but moved steadily westward from Awaji, fighting several battles with men dispatched by the tsuibushi, and eventually landed in Kyushu where he assaulted Dazaifu, captured it, and burned it. When they heard of this the various officers pursuing him rounded up every man they could and headed to Kyushu themselves. As chance had it their fleet arrived on the north coast at a beach where Sumitomo's forces were camped. Sumitomo was taken by surprise and his band was destroyed. The official report says that the tuibushi destroyed 800 boats and killed several hundred men. Sumitomo escaped in a small boat with only a couple of companions and tried to get back to Iyo province. However, he was intercepted by two soldiers patroling in a small boat of their own who captured him. He was sent to the capital where he was immediately executed (or committed suicide, there are two versions). 

This event shows clearly that the government no longer maintained anything like permanent armed forces. During the earlier reform period associated with Sugawara Michizane, the size of the guard units in the capital had been reduced to save money and they were now nothing more than security guards. A tsuibushi was a temporary officer (except on the northeast frontier) given a mandate to raise men and command them. His status was lower than that of a general and should be thought of as more a police office than a military one. The men who were raised to fight Sumitomo themselves came from the Insland Sea area, drawn from the provinces on the northern, Honshu, side of the Inland Sea but otherwise men of the same general sort as those making up Sumitomo's band. 

==Masakado's Rebellion==

In 890 a low-ranking imperial prince, Takamochi, who was a great-grandson of Kammu Tenno, was granted the clan name Taira and appointed to a term as zuryo in Kazusa province in the northeast, near modern Tokyo. When his appointment ended he stayed in the province. Two of his sons became military officers who served in the far northeast, others worked as zuryo. They seem to have maintained political connections with Fujiwara Mototsune and Fujiwara Tokihira and were given various offices and titles. They tended to settle down not just anywhere but at a provincial or district capital and they obtained office titles in the provincial system, often as oryoshi or kebiishi, commanders of policemen or security guards. Men of this class would also be found as the on-site managers of shoen. 

It is not known when Takamochi's grandson Masakado was born. As a youth he went to the capital and worked as a servant in the mansion of Fujiwara Tadahira. He never seems to have taken a government job, but his brother Sadamori was posted to one of the guards regiments. 

In about 931 Masakado fell out with his uncle Yoshikane. It is not clear whether it was over a woman or property. Yoshikane had a high post in the provincial government and was altogether a much more important person than Masakado. His brother was married to a daughter of Minamoto Mamoru, another important person in Hitachi province. In 935 there was a battle between Masakado and a force belonging to Minamoto Mamoru which Masakado won. Three of Mamoru’s sons were killed. 

Mamoru sent messengers to the capital and claimed that Masakado had rebelled against the provincial government. In 936 the two parties had a second battle. &lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt; says that Yoshikane had “several thousand” soldiers. Masakado won this battle also 

The government sent out an order to the parties to desist and submit their dispute to legal judgement. Masakado immediately went to the capital and offered his version of what had happened the previous year. The kebiishicho investigated and concluded that Masakado was in the wrong and convicted him of a crime. However, just at that time Emperor Suzaku celebrated coming to adulthood at the age of 15 and Masakado along with many others was pardoned. He went back to the east, determined never to submit himself to such a risk again.

His enemies had taken advantage of his departure to overrun his properties and attack his allies. However, he rallied his forces and launched a counter attack and routed his enemies but failed to destroy them. After this fight he sent Tadahira a letter denouncing Yoshikane. Yoshikane gave up the idea of fighting Masakado in battle and sent an assassin to try to get close to him at his house, while he assembled a small raiding party to hide nearby. The plot was detected, and Masakado attacked again. This time he destroyed Yoshikane’s forces so thoroughly that he was unable to make a comeback from it.

Taira Sadamori, who had been Yoshikane’s ally went to the capital in 938. Masakado heard of this and assumed he was going to denounce Masakado to the government. He put together a force of 100 horsemen and set out after him. He caught up with him in Shinano province and there was a fight. Sadamori was able to escape, however. 

At just about this time there was a large earthquake in the capital, and 4 persons in the imperial palace were killed. The soothsayers reported that this was caused by the fighting that was taking place in the provinces. At the end of 937 Mt Fuji had erupted, and this was now interpreted as meaning the same thing. Then the emperor fell ill and the udaijin died. The era name was changed. 

Meanwhile, Masakado was feeling good after having routed his enemies and decided to involve himself in a fight taking place in Musashi province between the zuryo and a district magistrate. The rivals were prince Miokiyo and his assistant Minamoto Tsunemoto versus the district magistrate Musashi no Takeshiba. 

&lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt; says that Musashi no Takeshiba was a particularly violent person. He had long been a thorn in the side of the zuryo, who decided to get rid of him. Takeshiba decided that he did not have the forces to fight them directly, so he abandoned his house and took to the hills with his men. Meanwhile, clerks in the provincial office had sent a complaint to the capital about prince Miokiyo, and news of this became general knowledge. &lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt; says that Masakado decided that since he was not related to either side he could be a mediator, and he would intervene to make peace. Up to now he had just been fighting a family civil war. Now he was presenting himself as, in some sense, a ruler. 

Masakado persuaded prince Miokiyo and Musashi to talk with each other, but Minamoto Tsunemoto refused and continued military action, so Musashi attacked and routed him. Tsunemoto went to the capital to complain. Meanwhile Taira Sadamori was already there and had petitioned the court and secured a commission to suppress Masakado. Bearing this document, he headed back east and arrived in the 6th month of 938. Sadamori found that Masakado was currently too strong, so he bided his time about trying to do something to fulfill his commission. Now Tsunemoto was in the capital airing his own complaints about both Masakado and prince Miokiyo. Tadahira responded by sending out an emissary to meet with Masakado and to determine whether or not there was actually a “rebellion” going on. He reached Masakado in the 3rd month of 939. This time Masakado did not go to the capital to defend himself. Instead he sent to Tadahira a request that he send out documents to the 5 provincial headquarters in the northern Kanto stating that the charge that Masakado is a rebel is false. At about this time Masakado’s original opponent Yoshikane died. 

The court now appointed a new man as governor of Kazusa, Kudara no Konishiki Sadatsura. Kudara no Konishiki means King of Paekche and this person was presumably a descendant of the Paekche royal family. He began investigating and soon determined that prince Miokiyo had been behaving illegally. Miokiyo fled to Masakado for protection. At this same time a new upheaval began in Hitachi province, a war between Fujiwara Genmyo and the zuryo Fujiwara Korechika. Korechika determined to arrest Genmyo, but the latter learned of this and fled to Masakado with his family. On the way he looted the storehouses of two districts, bringing a large amount of supplies to Masakado. Korechika requested Masakado, as the effective governor of Shimosa, to arrest Genmyo, but Masakado replied that no one knew where Genmyo had gone. Now Masakado was protecting two men who had been officially declared criminals. 

Masakado and Genmyo now decided to attack Korechika, and Miokiyo decided to join them. This was the 11th month of 939. According to &lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt; Masakado had 1000 men and Korechika had 3000. The raid destroyed 300 buildings in and around the provincial capital, and permitted Masakado to steal the official seal of Hitachi province and capture Korechika and several others. His previous actions could be argued about, but this was pretty obviously a rebellious act. He did not stop with that. According to &lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt;, he not only planned to take over all of the 8 Kanto provinces, but considered himself to have a claim on the throne, as a direct descendant of emperor Kammu. Whether this is true or not, in the 2nd month of 940 he attacked Shimotsuke province with “several thousand” men and seized its headquarters, and immediately after he also attacked Kozuke. 

At this point he sent another letter to Tadahira. In it he announced his appointments to governor for the 7 provinces excluding Musashi. Miokiyo, Genmei, and Masakado’s brother are on the list. 

Then Kudara no Konishiki Sadatsura returned to report, which he did in an audience with the Emperor and the leading officials. This was probably in the 12th month of 939. The courtiers were astounded by the news and demanded that an all out effort be made to deal with both Sumitomo in the west and Masakado in the east.

Tadahira responded by assembling all available men to guard the 14 gates of the city. It is known that in later times the city's defenses had been torn down, but it is not clear what the situation was at this time. He also ordered prayers for peace at all major shrines and temples. A special emissary was sent to the Ise Shrine, and the emperor performed a ceremony calling on all of the gods to protect the country. This marks the point at which the government tried to persuade Sumitomo to surrender, followed by the appointment of tsuibushi. Two months later the dajokan circulated to the eastern provinces a notification that anyone who killed Masakado would be given 5th rank (and the associated salary). Meanwhile Masakado invaded Hitachi province a second time, raiding districts he had not reached the first time.

In the 2nd month of 940 things started to go badly for Masakado. The army with which he had invaded Hitachi had to be released to go home. These &quot;armies&quot; were forces composed of volunteers recruited from land owners, men who had other business that needed to be taken care of. News of the reward offered by the government had arrived and Taira Sadamori, who possessed a written commission to capture Masakado formed an alliance with Fujiwara Hidesato, who had a position in the Shimosa provincial government to raise troops to accomplish that. &lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt; says that they gathered 4000 men. Masakado's ally Genmei decided to attack them without consulting Masakado and was disastrously defeated. Thirteen days after that fight the army moved against Masakado. With only a handful of men, Masakado had to flee his mansion which was taken and destroyed. Masakado is said to have had &quot;only&quot; 400 men.

Masakado was eventually cornered and forced to fight. He took advantage of a severe storm and attacked in the middle of it with the wind at his back and threw Hidesato's force into confusion, leading half of them to flee the battlefield. However, the wind direction suddenly changed and Hidesato and Sadamori seized the chance to launch an attack of their own that overwhelmed him. Masakado died on the battlefield.

The official expedition against Masakado was proclaimed 6 days before this battle and the news of Masakado's defeat and death reached the capital 11 days after the event. A detailed report from Fujiwara Hidesato followed and he was rewarded by appointment to 4th rank while Taira Sadamori received 5th rank. Hidesato became a somewhat prominent personage in the capital until his involvement in a later political controversy on the losing side. The soldiers recruited by tsuibushi to fight Masakado were all released to go home, and new zuryo were dispatched to take charge of the provinces that were involved.

The most noteworthy bit of knowledge resulting from consideration of the affairs of Fujiwara Sumitomo and Taira Masakado is that these disturbances raised by wealthy provincials with private armies were by rival private armies from the same provinces. Troops organized by the central government and commanded by government generals were not involved. The tsuibushi received no government resources other than the power to commandeer items from the provincial authorities. Whatever rewards the warriors involved received had to come from the tsuibushi himself; the government paid them nothing. This was, in effect, what Masakado and the others themselves did. Masakado's two raids into Hitachi province had the goal of seizing the government rice storehouses to provide resources necessary to support his army. When Hidesato and Sadamori took Masakado's mansion &lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt; says that they captured thereby large quantities of food and other essential supplies for their own use. 

&lt;i&gt;Shomonki&lt;/i&gt; does not name its author. It provides a lot of detailed information about Masakado and the other prominent actors, and it is clear that the author was highly knowledgeable about the Kanto region, both geographically and politically. He was also very clear about personalities and events in the capital, and his text gives ample evidence of knowledge of Chinese literature and of Buddhism. This has led to the theory that the author was a Buddhist monk who was a native of the Kanto but resident in the capital. The work is dated to the 6th month of 940, 4 months after the death of Masakado. There is also a more or less contemporary book about Sumitomo, called &lt;i&gt;Sumitomo Tsuitoki&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;The History of the Destruction of Sumitomo&quot;). It is not nearly as well informed and seems to consist mainly of material copied from official documents.

==Capital Politics==

In the midst of the excitement about Sumitomo and Masakado the 14th son of the retired emperor Godaigo (Suzaku's brother) became a legal adult. He was immediately married to a daughter of Fujiwara Morosuke, the second son of Tadahira. In 944 this prince became the designated heir to Suzaku Tenno. Suzaku then abdicated the throne in 946 and the heir assumed it. He is known as Murakami Tenno. Contemporary sources say that Suzaku was forced to abdicate under pressure from his mother who wished to see both her sons on the throne. Suzaku continued to lead an active life after his abdication and was noted for giving excellent parties. There is no indication that he ever showed any interest in matters related to government. Murakami was 21 at the time of his enthronement, but Tadahira continued as regent with no fuss.

At this time the sangi level officials were 16 in number. Nine of them were Fujiwara, including Tadahira and all four of his sons. Six were Minamoto, including two sons of retired emperor Godaigo. Two were from lesser clans, including Ono Yoshifusa, who was the tsuibushi put in charge of raising forces to oppose Sumitomo and the man who brought Sumitomo to the capital in chains. He was the only member of the group with any experience in the provinces. 

Tadahira died in 949 and Murakami appointed no successor as regent. The leader of the Fujiwara interest was Tadahira's son Morosuke. He was only the second son, but his older brother appears to have had no interest in politics. Morosuke was Murakami's father-in-law and it seems that despite the lack of the regent's title, Morosuke ran the government as if he were the regent. 

Contemporary records mention no fewer than nineteen major fires in the capital between 949 and 965. In 960 one of them burned down the imperial palace, and in discussing this event one source provides a description of the capital. It says that the western half of the city was almost entirely deserted, with only a few buildings and those dilapidated. It was inhabited only by the extremely poor. It flooded during the rainy season and was unhealthy. In the eastern part of the city, the area north of Shijo (4th street) was the most desirable region and was thickly settled by both rich and poor. It was higher ground that stayed dry. Today, the eastern end of Shijo is the main shopping street with most of the famous department stores and the area north of Shijo is the higher status part of the city as it was then.

Fujiwara Morosuke died rather young (53) in 960. His grandson prince Norihira attained adulthood in 963 and was married to a daughter of Suzaku, as if Murakami were trying to open the way to an heir who did not have a Fujiwara grandfather. However, Murakami himself died young (42) in 967 so it is difficult to know what, if anything, he was planning. Prince Norihira was enthroned without incident. He is known as Reizei Tenno. A regent was immediately appointed, Fujiwara Saneyori, the older brother of Morosuke. There are rumors in contemporary sources that the reason a regent was necessary despite the fact that Reizei's grandfather was dead was that Reizei was not mentally normal. The only symptom that is mentioned is that he apparently cared for nothing but playing football. It was, of course, necessary to designate an heir. There were only two plausible candidates, Reizei's brothers Prince Tamehira and Prince Morihira. Both appeared to be mentally normal. Tamehira was the oldest, but he was married to a daughter of Minamoto Takaakira, so Saneyori selected prince Morihira. He claimed that this was at the request of Murakami Tenno. In the event, the Fujiwara position was soon reinforced when Reizei's Fujiwara wife, Koretada's daughter, gave birth to a son. Fujiwara Koretada was the eldest son of Morosuke, followed by Kanemichi and Kaneie. This prince eventually became emperor as Kazan Tenno.

In 969 there occurred a political upheaval known as the &quot;Anna Incident&quot; after the year title in use. It occurred when two relatively low ranking officials accused two others of treason. There was an investigation and several people were arrested. It was concluded that Minamoto Takaakira was somehow involved (there is no clear statement as to the justification for this) and he was sent to serve at Dazaifu. This removed the highest ranking official who was not a Fujiwara. The entire incident was over and Takaakira was on his way to Dazaifu under guard within 24 hours. The next day the two accusers were promoted. One of the lower ranking officials who was exiled as a part of this was the son of Fujiwara Hidesato, one of the conquerors of Taira Masakado. That particular branch of the Fujiwara disappeared from prominence from this time, in the Kanto as well as in the capital. Takaakira's exile did not last long. He was allowed to return to the capital two years later, but lived quietly and was no longer involved in government.

One of the officers whose accusation triggered the affair was Minamoto Mitsunaka. His father had fought against Masakado. This group of Minamoto were &quot;Seiwa Genji,&quot; descended from Seiwa Tenno of the 9th century, and the ancestors of the politically and militarily prominent Minamoto of later times. There were at the time nine different &quot;branches&quot; of the Minamoto, descended from nine different emperors. The government appointed an official Minamoto clan chief, always the one who held the highest rank at court, but neither they nor others considered them as being anything like a traditional aristocratic clan. At this period the Seiwa Genji were among the least important of the Minamoto groups. This of course, explains why one of them should have been living in the Kanto at the time of Masakado's activity and become involved in the fighting. In 960 there had been rumors that a son of Masakado was planning to attack the capital, and two officers were appointed to organize a defense. One was Minamoto Mitsunaka and the other was Okura Haruzane, a warrior from Kyushu who had participated in the fighting against Sumitomo. The government appears to have adopted the &quot;use a thief to catch a thief&quot; theory of dealing with armed provincials, relying on officers with provincial backgrounds. 

Five months after the Anna Incident Reizei Tenno abdicated in favor of his brother who became Enyu Tenno. Saneyori continued as regent. Reizei's son, the grandson of Fujiwara Koretada, was designated the heir. Reizei lived for another 40 years after his abdication. Saneyori died in 970 and was followed as regent by Koretada. Koretada died only two years later and was succeeded by his brother Kanemichi. At the time the highest ranking Minamaoto at court was Kaneakira, brother of Takaakira (both sons of the retired emperor Godaigo). He did not have any daughters married to emperors. In 977 he was officially restored to the imperial clan and given elevated rank, but was effectively removed from participation in government. It is not known whether this was at his request or forced on him by the Fujiwara. 

Fujiwara Morosuke had 10 sons altogether (from 5 wives) and three of them became regent. Koretada and Kanemichi have been mentioned. The third was Kaneie. At the time that Reizei abdicated Kaneie was suddenly promoted to a higher rank than Kanemichi. There is no explanation as to why. In 972 when it seemed likely that Koretada was going to die there was discussion as to who would succeed him. A document written by the emperor's mother turned up which stated that the succession to the regency ought to go to the oldest. The emperor said that he could not go against his mother's wishes and appointed Kanemichi as regent. When the next high ranking spot for a Fujiwara opened up Kanemichi refused to appoint his brother and instead chose Fujiwara Yoritada, a son of Saneyori. In 977 when Kanemichi lay dying, Kaneie decided to go to the palace and petition the emperor to be allowed to succeed him. Some of Kanemichi's servants noticed this (their palaces were next door) and he dragged himself out of bed and raced Kaneie to the palace and told the emperor that it was his dying wish that Yoritada succeed him as regent. He died a month later. It appears that these two did not like each other very much.

Yoritada was the next regent, but the power of Kaneie's position became too much to resist. He was grandfather to four imperial princes whereas Yoritada had none. In 984 Enyu Tenno abdicated in favor of Kazan Tenno and the next heir designated was one of Kaneie's grandsons. Kazan was the grandson of the deceased Fujiwara Koretada. Yoritada continued as regent. The change of ruler benefited Koretada's son Yoshichika, who now joined the rapid-promotion track. It may be easily seen that political struggles between the Fujiwara and others had all but ceased and now the competion was among the steadily increasing number of active Fujiwara lineages. 

Kazan Tenno's favorite wife died in an advanced stage of pregnancy in 986 and the emperor became distraught and started to talk of abdicating and becoming a Buddhist monk. If he did so Kaneie would be the grandfather of the next emperor and the inevitable next regent. Yoshichika would be shut out, and he formed a small conspiratorial group. One night in the 6th month of 986 they kidnapped the emperor and smuggled him out of the palace into a carriage. They started to head out of town but were intercepted by a party of soldiers who took the carriage away to an unknown location. It eventually transpired that the commander of this force was Minamoto Mitsunaka and he was acting under the instruction of Kaneie. Kaneie was in the palace and he seized the imperial regalia and posted guards, and dispatched his youngest son, the future regent Michinaga, to inform the regent Yoritada that the emperor had been taken away. Kazan was taken to a rural temple where he shaved his head and entered monastic orders. That same evening Ichijo Tenno was hastily enthroned. This was Kaneie's grandson, aged 7. Kaneie was designated regent on the spot. Yoshichika was now informed of the newly retired emperor's location and went to join him, also entering the priesthood and retiring from public life.

Up to this point Kaneie had been sufficiently in the shadow of his brothers and other Fujiwara that he had been unable to raise his own sons to the higher level of ranks. Now he set to work to make up for this. He had three sons (with high ranking mothers) and all were jumped up to sangi level almost simultaneously. As it happened this worked very much to the advantage of Michinaga. In the normal course of events he would have followed along well behind his older brothers. The advantage gained was not in respect to competition with his brothers, by the way, but with the other branches of the clan. It meant that when his older brothers unexpectedly died young he had the rank to compete.

Kaneie was regent for only 4 years when he died at the age of 62. He was followed by his oldest son Michitada. Michitada was a notorious drunkard who embarrassed himself in public many times. The next brother, Michikane was both able and ambitious and determined to replace his brother as soon as possible. However, in 995 there was a dangerous epidemic of measles (a new disease to Japan at the time) and 8 out of the 14 sangi level counselors died during a period of months. Michitada was one of them. It appears that he did not die of the epidemic but showed symptoms characteristic of diabetes, a disease common to heavy drinkers. He appealed to the emperor to designate his own son, Korechika, the next regent, but this was refused. Korechika was given all of the essential powers of the office but not the title. The reason was probably that he did not have the degree of relationship with the emperor felt necessary. This launched a power struggle between Korechika and Kaneie's second son Michikane. After 17 days of politicking Michikane was named regent. However, he died of the measles 7 days later and is remembered as the &quot;Seven Day Regent.&quot; Two other sangi level officials died the same day. Now the fight began all over again, between Korechika and Michinaga. The immediate result was that the regency lapsed, not to be restored for 20 years.

In the first month of 996 a strange incident occurred. Korechika was keeping company with a certain woman and this woman's sister was also keeping company with the retired emperor Kazan. Korechika happened to see Kazan with the correct sister but leaped to the conclusion that it was the wrong sister and became enraged. He formed a gang of young aristocrats and went out at hight to hang around Kazan's house. When Kazan returned home from some expedition on horseback, with attendants, there was a confrontation during which some arrows were fired. Two of Kazan's guards were killed and Kazan claimed later of have had an arrow shot through the sleeve of his coat. Kazan reported an attack by bandits who he thought were trying to kidnap him, but the truth quickly came out. Korechika was dismissed from all rank and office and an order was issued to arrest him. However, when guards came to his house, he escaped them. A couple of months later the mother of the emperor became seriously ill and there were rumors that Korechika had had her magically cursed. This prompted the government to look for him more serously, and he was found hiding at the house of a sister who was one of the maids of honor at court. Korechika refused to come out and the kebiishi surrounded the place for four days before going in. When they did so, Korechika had escaped again. However, he was caught a few days later and packed off to exile. He wasn't finished. He escaped exile and sneaked back to the capital again, but was again captured and this time taken all the way to Kyushu and closely guarded.

==Aristocratic Marriage Customs==

At this point in time it is possible to insert a pretty detailed discussion of marriage customs among the aristocracy. The proximate cause is the existence of the book &lt;i&gt;Kagero Nikki&lt;/i&gt;. This is an autobiography in the form of a diary of one of the celebrated poets of the time who happened to have been one of the wives of Fujiwara Kaneie. Reference has already been made of the institution of &quot;visitation marriage&quot; in the context of the early origins of the regency. With Kaneie we are now just about at the end of the existence of this practice.

In its simplest form it was the custom that when a young man was accepted by the family of a young woman as her husband, the woman continued to live at home where she was visited for longer or shorter periods by her husband, who might have other wives in other homes. The children were raised in their mother's home in circumstances in which the social role of the father in what we would consider a more normal type of marriage was taken by the grandfather. A man's sons may never actually live with him or associate with him particularly closely. When his daughters reached marriageable age he usually claimed them and moved them into his own palace so that he might then assume the role of raising his own grandchildren. When a house was passed on through inheritance the heir was more likely to be a daughter than a son. The son would naturally have a mansion of his own long before his father died. The daughters, on the other hand, often had no other place to live.

Kaneie's wife, whose name is not known, discusses all of this in considerable detail. Kaneie appears to have been one of the last to live this life in its complete form. It was already considered old fashioned, and it mostly died out with the following generation. When Kaneie's son Michinaga married he acquired a house and moved his new wife into it and they lived together as long as they both lived.

When they married Kaneie's wife was probably 18 and he was 26. This was early in his career and his rank was not particularly high. His father-in-law was a member of the second tier of the nobility, whose highest ranking office was on about the same level as Kaneie's first office. This wife was not the mother of any of his sons who became regent, but a fourth one with a less distinguished career. In Japanese she is usually referred to as &quot;Michitsune's mother.&quot; 

The relationship began with the exchange of notes that took the form of short poems. This was absolutely mandatory. Even if you were the worst poet in the city, you could not avoid writing at least a few if you wanted to start up communication with a marriageable girl. It had to be in your own handwriting and it could not be copied out of a book of old poems. The primary subject should be passionate requests for the opportunity of a meeting in person, and it was expected that the first several would be rejected, probably in poems written by a maid or the girl's mother. When you got one written by the girl herself you were making progress.

If you did get a meeting, you were expected to sneak in after dark and to leave before dawn. In actual fact this visit would be expected and everyone would be careful to stay out of the way and make it easy. Both &lt;i&gt;Kagero Nikki&lt;/i&gt; and the novel &lt;i&gt;Genji Monogatari&lt;/i&gt; make it clear that the permission to visit would be extended only after discussion within the family, with the mother most of the time making the final decision. If you repeated the nocturnal visit for three nights you would then be approached by the girl's family before leaving the third dawn and invited to join them and from that point you would be considered a husband. You could visit any time and would be able to set up a room in the house where you could keep changes of clothing and anything else you might wish to have handy in that part of town. Divorce was equally simple. Sometimes the man simply stopped coming, sometimes he came in and removed his things and informed everyone that he was not planning to return. It sometimes happened that a woman who thought she had been divorced would accept a new husband only to have the old one show up again.

According to &lt;i&gt;Kagero Nikki&lt;/i&gt; Kaneie was a pretty rotten husband by almost anyone's standards. He visited intensely for an initial period but that stopped when his wife became pregnant. After that his attendance was sporadic and it soon became common knowledge that he was spending his free time with other women. Sometimes he would even come to the house to change clothes before going off to visit another woman. Another time the servants reported that he was moving a woman from one house to another and everyone went up to peek out the front as the procession went right by the front gate. He did not completely abandon Michitsune's mother, though he never again visited her as a husband, but he did take a rather remote interest in the raising of the child. The husband was not expected in this model to financially support his wife, by the way. After her father died she lived on whatever she inherited from him. Kaneie sent an occasional present, but provided no regular income and this was perfectly normal.

At the time Kaneie married Michitsune's mother he already had a wife, the mother of his three politically important sons. Afterwards he acquired several more women and, as was often the case, it is sometimes hard to say which counted as wives and which as merely concubines. The difference was mainly whether the woman's father was important enough that you wished to be known as his son-in-law. If the woman was so poor that you needed to move her into your house, or at any rate into a house you owned, she was a concubine.

It appears that in very ancient times this type of marriage was normal throughout Japan and aspects of these customs survived into modern times in some rural areas. However, as early as the time of the &lt;i&gt;Manyoshu&lt;/i&gt; poetry collection of the Nara period many, if not all, commoners had shifted over to a pattern featuring nuclear families. 

The main change was that it became common for the new husband to actually move into the father-in-law's house and make it his principal residence. This was accompanied by a reduction in the number of wives. It became rare to visit elsewhere. When Michinaga married he did not do this, but he borrowed a house from his father-in-law and moved into it along with his wife. It has been suggested that the mansion in question, the Tsuchimikado mansion (after the street it was on), was the inherited property of Michinaga's mother-in-law which she was thereby passing to her daughter. Afterward it became the property of one of Michinaga's daughters. The custom gradually shifted to the point that a man would only have one woman considered a wife, though he might, if he could afford it, also have concubines. Once a man started to live in the same house as his wife he also assumed a more intimate involvement in the raising of his children. Michinaga had a second wife and at the time that he married her she was living in the former mansion of his father, Kaneie, the Higashi Sanjo mansion. This had been inherited by one of Michinaga's sisters who had loaned it to his new wife (as she was living in the palace as empress). Michinaga is also credited with two children born to women who were not considered wives. He had two sons and four daughters with his first wife and four sons and two daughters with the second, so he does not seem to have been a hit-and-run husband in either case.

The imperial household was different and it remained different for some time. Emperors did not ever (as far as there is evidence) visit wives in their father's houses, the wives moved into the palace. However, it was common for the wives to return home for long visits, often months at at time. It was almost the rule that a pregnant wife would go home to have the baby and probably stay there for a significant time afterward. When she returned to the side of the emperor, she normally left the child behind with its grandparents. Most imperial children, including the future emperors, were raised in their grandparents' homes and only started coming to the palace when they were old enough to behave properly.

==Status and Promotion==

The original administrative codes called for an annual review process for considering the awarding of official rank and promotions within the ranks, to be held in the 1st month, and a semi-annual process to similarly deal with assignments to office. This system was still in effect and was of great importance to those whose livelihoods depended on it. There are several surviving examples of letters written by people to senior officials in which they advocated their own appointment to rank and office. 

The system held 30 grades of rank which fell into four categories. Holders of the 9th rank were humble laborers, holders of the 6th, 7th and 8th ranks were low level bureaucrats, holders of the 4th and 5th ranks were middle managers, and holders of the 3rd rank and higher were the rulers of the state. This last group consisted of some 20 persons if all of the offices at this level were filled. Often the number was much smaller than that. By the late 10th century the ranks below 5th were essentially meaningless. Nearly all of the bureaucratic apparatus, the &quot;8 ministries and 100 offices,&quot; had disappeared. The exceptions were the six guards units, the kebiishi police force (which was not in the ritsuryo structure) and the two high level secretarial offices, the Udaiben and Sadaiben. To these may be added the staffs that ran the numerous palace operations (emperor's palace, retired emperor's palace, empress's palace, crown prince's palace) and the emperor's private secretariat, the Kurodo (also outside the ritsuryo structure). Far more people were employed in the private offices, mandokoro, run by the leading aristcrats from within their private mansions to manage their properties, incomes, and retenues of servants.

It would appear that the bureaucratic center was the Kurodo which took care of the preparation of all official documents and handled the flow of documents within the government. The two regular secretarial offices provided low level scribes for the use of officials and handled the document archives. The two joint heads of the Kurodo, called Kurodonoto, controlled all of this activity. The official career of a relatively humble member of the aristocracy would begin as either an officer in a guards unit or a clerk in one of the secretarial offices, and might rise as high as 5th rank and appointment as governor or zuryo of a province. A higher ranking aristocrat might start at 5th rank (rank only, no actual office for a teen-ager) with his first real job at 4th rank and a solid chance of promotion to 3rd rank late in his career. The sons of senior aristocrats started at 4th rank and the eldest son of the Fujiwara regent usually started at 3rd rank, already eligible to move up if his father should die young.

The officials of 3rd rank and higher were collectively known as Sangi (Sangi was also an office, the lowest ranking one that counted as part of the Sangi group) or Kugyo. They formed the members of the Dajokan, which was a committee that functioned as the decision making center of the government. It met only when needed. This also was an informal body, not mentioned in the administrative codes. When a meeting was called it was because of some problem that needed a decision and there would be an agenda, prepared by the Korodo and personally delivered to the meeting by one of the Kurodonoto along with any supporting documentation. The matter would then be discussed. The formal structure called for all except for newly appointed Sangi to speak in order, lowest rank first. Newcomers spent their first year just listening. If a consensus emerged, the matter was decided. If there was any dissent, the matter was postponed. If there was a decision, a clerk would be called in to write it up under the direction of the Dajokan members, and this would be delivered to the Kurodo, which would convert everything into documents of the proper form to be submitted to the emperor or the regent for signature. If the decision required action by governors or others, the Kurodo would handle that communication. By very ancient custom in Japan really important business was supposed to be conducted before dawn. In a rare case where the information is available, an important Dajokan meeting is known to have started at 2 am and finished at dawn.

As an example of how the distribution of offices was handled, in 996 Minamoto Kunimori was appointed governor of Echizen. This was a very good appointment as Echizen was a first grade provice (out of four grades) and its governor could reasonably expect to become wealthy, if he was not so already. On the same occasion Fujiwara Tametoki was appointed governor of Awaji province, a fourth grade province. Tametoki was a poor man (by aristocratic standards) with a large family and he was upset about this. Tametoki was a well known writer of poetry and he was also the father of Murasaki Shikibu (&quot;the Murasaki Lady,&quot; after the main female character in her book), the writer of ''Genji Monogatari.'' It is not known whether an early version of her novel was already in circulation at this time as the earliest mention of it is dated 1007. Tametoki complained in the form of a poem and made sure that the poem was shown to Emperor Ichijo. Ichijo was supposedly sympathetic but indicated that he had no control over those appointments. However, the incident caused gossip and news came to Michinaga, who called in Kunimori and &quot;suggested&quot; that he turn down the appointment. Tametoki was then made governor of Echizen, and his daughter accompanied him to his province, so the bits in her book about provincial life may have been based on her own experiences. A few months later Kunimori received a replacement appointment to Harima province, also a first grade province. Neither the Emperor nor Michinaga could change the official appointment once the appointments had been published.

Sei Shonagon's well known book ''Makura no Soshi,'' &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; also discusses poor aristocrats and their efforts to gain appointment to office.

==Michinaga==

After the fall of Fujiwara Korechika Fujiwara Michinaga was appointed to 2nd rank and Sadaijin, the highest available rank and office. He was the effective ruler even though Emperor Ichijo still declined to permit the appointment of a regent. He had already been given the power of &quot;nairan&quot; which was the core of the regency. This was the power to control the flow of documents to and from the emperor and to issue edicts in the name of the emperor. As it happens, Michinaga and Emperor Ichijo got along quite well together so the somewhat anomalous situation did not cause any problem. Michinaga had no standing to try to force anything because, having been brought to the top office at an early age though the deaths of his brothers, his oldest daughter was only 9 years old and it would be years yet before he might have an imperial grandson of his own.

He certainly tried to push the process along as fast as he could. He held the &quot;coming out&quot; ceremony for his daughter in the 2nd month of 999 when she was 12 (Japanese count, 11 by our method). This ceremony proclaimed that the girl was of marriagable age and it was usual to hold it at 16 or 17. The next day she was assigned 3rd rank (women got rank, and some got office, working in the women's apartments of palaces). This made her officially eligible to enter the palace as Imperial concubine. There was a delay because the palace burned down in one of the many fires of the period, but she was accepted as a resident in the 11th month. The actual process officially started 5 weeks earlier when a committee was appointed to organize it. A new resident needed a new apartment set aside somewhere in the palace, and it had to be furnished and supplied with a force of servants. There is reason to think that Fujiwara Shoshi had 40 attendants of all levels as this was the size of the party that followed her into the palace. Michinaga almost certainly paid for setting up her apartment. He is known to have arranged for the privacy screens used in lieue of internal walls to be painted by the most famous painter of the day Asukanobe Toshikata.

All of the leading courtiers sent in congratulatory poems that were copied into a book by the most famous calligrapher, Fujiwara Kozei. Only one refused, Fujiwara Sanesuke. This is important because Sanesuke was the author of the most invaluable book from this period, a political diary ''Shoyuki'' that covers the time from 982 to 1032 with gaps. The majority of what we know about the daily interactions among the ruling group comes from this book. Sanesuke consistently appears in his own book as rival and enemy to Michinaga. There is no clear statement as to exactly how this enmity arose, but the rivalry was natural as the rise of Michinaga threated to permit his descendants to crown Sanesuke's out of the top aristocracy.

At the time that Ichijo became emperor there were three living empresses Reizei's widow, Enyu's widow, and Ichijo's mother who had been a secondary wife of Enyu with the title nyogo. This had come to replace the variety of earlier titles for imperial women. The principal wife was called chugu and all others were nyogo. The old Nara period &quot;empress&quot; titles were reserved for the widows and imperial mothers. Fujiwara Shoshi was made nyogo soon after her arrival in the palace. Ichijo already had a chugu, Minamoto Teishi, the mother of a prince, Atsuyasu. Michinaga desperately wanted his daughter to become chugu, but thought that the only way he could do that was to elevate Teishi to empress, opening up the position. It took him a year of negotiation with Ichijo and his mother to get their agreement. This was finally done in 1000. Then Teishi died in childbirth at the age of 25 before the end of the year, so it proved unnecessary, though it did establish a new precedent. Michinaga did not get his imperial grandchild until 1008 when Atsuhira was born. Then, in 1011 Ichijo became seriously ill and abdicated in favor of the crown prince, who was prince Iyesada, like Ichijo himself, a grandson of Fujiwara Kaneie. Ichijo died 9 days later at the age of 32. The new ruler is known as Sanjo Tenno as he was raised in Kaneie's Sanjo palace. Sanjo was also an adult emperor and refused the appointment of a regent. This became much more important than before because both Michinaga and Sanjo were domineering types and they soon began to fight each other, with Sanesuke offering Sanjo encouragement while carefully avoiding coming out into the open himself as an enemy of Michinaga. As soon as Sanjo was put on the throne Michinaga's grandson was made the crown prince, so Sanjo had to have known that Michinaga would try to pressure him into an early abdication.

The style of the struggle is well suggested by the following entry from Sanesuke's diary (from 1011): “Michinaga suggested that something he wanted to do should be done on the fifth day, but I secretly communicated to the emperor through one of the servants that the fifth would be a bad day, and, as I had hoped, the emperor agreed with me and ordered otherwise.”

The most famous incident in the political cold war occurred in 1012. When he took the throne Sanjo already had two important wives, a daughter of Michinaga named Kenshi and a daughter of Fujiwara Naritoki named Seishi. Kenshi had been promoted to chugu at the time that Shoshi was made empress but Seishi remained merely nyogo. Naritoki had died 16 years earlier, so Seishi was without an external protector. However, Michinaga had an even bigger problem that Kenshi was already either 18 or 19 and had no children, whereas Seishi was the mother of Prince Atsuakira and 5 other children. Sanjo was unhappy that this woman, whom he considered as his wife, merely had the status of nyogo. He therefore decreed that she would be raised to the status of Empress, following the precedent recently established for Shoshi. However, there was no precedent for elevating a woman whose father had the relatively low status of Fujiwara Naritoki, who had never held a higher office than Dainagon. Sanjo got around that by postumously appointing Naritoki to the office of Udaijin. Michinaga found out about this long before Sanjo's edicts were made public. He did nothing public to oppose Sanjo's plans.

What he did do was arrange that his daughter Kenshi, who was currently staying at his palace, would make her ceremonial return to the imperial palace on the same day as that scheduled for the elevation of Seishi to Empress. The leading noblemen were forced to decide which ceremony they would attend. According to Sanesuke's diary, it was a rainy day, but nearly all of the nobles felt that they had no choice but to go to Michinaga's palace and join the procession carrying Kenshi to the palace. Michinaga had a notable temper and no one wanted to cross him. Sanesuke, of course, went to the enthronement ceremony and ended up being the highest ranking official present, accompanied by only 3 others. One of the others was Fujiwara Takaie, who had just been appointed the administrator of the new Empress's palace, the second was Sanesuke's brother, and the third was Seishi's brother. Messengers were sent to Michinaga's palace to attempt to round up some others, but the messengers were jeered at and, Sanesuke says, one of the Sangi threw rocks at them.

Then Michinaga began making trouble about the paperwork. It seems that Sanjo's original edict had been written in Japanese and it had to be translated into Chinese to become an official document. Michinaga was in control of the office that handled that and the edict disappeared within and never emerged. Then he started complaining about the wording of it and demanded changes. Still later he made difficulties about arranging for guards for the new palace. This style of a steady barrage of annoyances was evidently his standard way of expressing his displeasure. As of this incident everyone was aware that there was a conflict between Michinaga and the Emperor. The next fight occurred when the Emperor wished to appoint a son of Sanesuke to the office of Kurodonoto. Michinaga absolutely obstructed that. 

In 1013 there was another public humiliation of the Emperor on the occasion of the annual festival of the Kamo Shrine, the famous Gion festival which is still performed much the same way it was then. Sanesuke had previously proposed that something be done to reign in the extravangance of the parade floats constructed by the nobles and the Emperor had issued an appropriate degree that limited the number of participants and regulated the lavishness of their costumes. Michinaga made no public opposition to this. Indeed, one of the other noble diarists of the time wrote that Michinaga had proposed the limits in numbers and Sanesuke was responsible for the part limiting the cost of the costumes. However, when the day of the festival came around the display was even more extravagant than in previous years, and it came to be known that Michinaga had told everyone to ignore the edict and hold nothing back. When Sanesuke saw this he hid in his cart and had it sneak away from the parade area. The Kebiishi police, who were supposed to enforce the edit, did nothing, and Michinaga did nothing to punish those who had ignored the edict. Four days after the parade the Emperor asked Michinaga to investigate why the police had done nothing, and Michinaga turned the task over to Sanesuke. Sanesuke collected testimony and wrote a report which he sent to Michinaga, who ignored it.

After this it appears that Michinaga decided that it would be necessary to force the Emperor to abdicate so that his grandson Prince Atsuhira (a son of Empress Shoshi who was born in 1008) could take the throne. However, it took a long time. During the course of 1014 the emperor went blind in his left eye and deaf in his left ear, and by the end of the year he was almost completely blind and unable to do any paper work. Sanesuke's diary for a date early in 1015 says that &quot;someone&quot; said that it appeared that the Emperor could no longer perform his duties, and in the 10th month Michinaga proposed that under the circumstances the regency ought to be revived. In the 11th month the palace burned down only two months after it had been repaired after a fire the year before. Michinaga now claimed that these calamities were the result of the inadequacy of the Emperor. Sanjo finally agreed and abdicated in the 1st month of 1016, on condition that his son Prince Atsuakira be appointed crown prince to the new emperor. Atsuhira was enthroned at the age of nine and is known as Goichijo Tenno. Naturally, Michinaga was appointed regent. Sanjo died in 1017 at the age of 42.

Only a year later Michinaga resigned his office and his son Yorimichi was appointed to replace him. Michinaga continued to run things from behind the scenes. This was unprecedented. No one as young as Yorimichi (who was 26) had ever been regent, and no one had ever resigned the regency so as to turn it over to someone else. In this Michinaga was behaving much more like an emperor than any official had dared to do before.

Michinaga's next problem was Prince Atsuakira. Up to this time almost all princes who found themselves in Atsuakira's position were accused of treason and either killed or exiled. Once again, Michinaga did things differently. Historians cannot be sure whether it was Michinaga or Atsuakira who came up with the solution, but it was both clever and humane. Atsuakira was 24 years old and the father of several children. In the 8th month of 1017 Prince Atsuakira requested a meeting with Michinaga and Michinaga went to the palace to see him. Atsuakira told him that he wished to resign from the position of crown prince. The diaries all say that Atsuakira's father in law and mother were horrified and tried to talk him out of it, but he remained firm. Atsuakira was given a suitable title and an establishment that were both comparable to those of an abdicated emperor or a widow empress. It was noted that one component of his new establishment was the right to the income of one province and the power to appoint the zuryo.

Later the same year Michinaga allowed himself to be appointed Dajodaijin, the highest office in the ritsuryo structure and normally left vacant. Only men whose powers were essentially dictatorial ever had the nerve to assume this office. He resigned it only 4 months later, but was entitled to be styled &quot;the former Dajodaijin&quot; for the remainder of his life.

In early 1018 the coming of age ceremony of Emperor Goichijo was held. He was only 11 years old, but this made him eligible to marry. Michinaga's daughter Ishi was soon received in the palace. The diaries allow us to know something of the details, not unlike a normal aristocratic marriage though the status of the emperor was so high that he could not visit outside the palace to court a girl. A letter from the Emperor to Ishi was delivered by a Kurodonoto to Michinaga's palace where all of the senior nobles were gathered. The letter was received by Michinaga's younger brother who carried it into the women's quarters. There was no reply. A couple of days later there was a second letter and this one received a reply. Two days after that Ishi's procession went from Michinaga's mansion to the palace. Ishi was 20 years old but was very small and everyone said that she and the Emperor looked good together. Ishi was a sister of the Emperor's mother. As has been noted earlier, this would be considered incest only if she had been a sister of the Emperor's father. Rather soon after Ishi was promoted empress. That meant that there were four empresses alive, one of Michinaga's sisters and three of his daughters.

Michinaga's last years were politically quiet. He had been seriously ill in 1016 and made preparations to retire from public life and become a monk, but he recoverd. In 1020 and 1025 the measles returned. People noted that it seemed to affect only persons who were too young to have been touched by it during the first epidemic. In 1025 two of Michinaga's daughters died, one at least partially due to the measles (she caught it, but died during childbirth). Emperor Goichijo and his Empress Ishi both caught the measles but survived. During this year Michinaga moved into the Buddhist temple Hojoji, which he had constructed and which seems to have occupied most of his attention since at least 1019. Almost the only occasions where he is mentioned during these years are when he complained to Yorimichi about things related to the construction project. In 1027 a son who was a Buddhist monk died, then the retired Empress Kenshi and at the end of the year Michinaga himself, after a lengthy illness. He was 62 years of age.

He makes a suitable ending for this phase of history because he stands at the very pinnacle of Fujiwara power, and also at the end of the time when it can be said that the ritsuryo system of government still had relevance. The next stage is mainly the story of the decline of the Fujiwara and the rise of new contenders for power and of the beginnings of new types of institutions to replace the surviving remnants of the ritsuryo state. Discussions of the power of the Fujiwara usually focus on the regency and the ability to ride on the back of the emperor, as it were. However, it was equally important that the Fujiwara were able to use their position to make sure that the dominant lineage also controlled the Dajokan through secure control of most of the highest offices in the bureaucratic system. The main thing that is different about the next period is that while the emperor remained important the importance of the Dajokan and the offices that conferred membership faded to almost nothing.

==Foreign Relations==

Very little has needed said about Japan's foreign relations since the end of the wars with Silla over the Mimana region of southern Korea for the good reason that there were essentially no foreign relations to write about. However, there were two instances during Michinaga's time where the government had to take note of the outside world.

On the 1st day of the 10th month of 997 an emergency messenger arrived from Dazaifu in Kyushu and interrupted a ceremony at court to deliver his message. He had ridden all the way using the post system of relays of horses that had been set up for this purpose. The courtiers initially had the idea that the message concerned an invasion by Koreans, but when Michinaga read the letter from the commander at Dazaifu, it became clear that what had happened was an attack by pirates from Amami Oshima, the second largest island of the Ryukyu chain, south of Kyushu. The Ryukyus were not made a part of Japan until the 19th century and did not come under Japanese political control until the 17th century. This is the only time that they caused a problem that reached the central government. Michinaga decided that this was not a real emergency and the ceremonial was resumed. A meeting of the Dajokan was set for the next day. 

The report stated that 3 coastal provinces of Kyushu and the two island provinces of Iki and Tsushima had been raided and that some 300 persons had been captured by the pirates. The Dajokan prepared instructions for Dazaifu to fight the pirates, arrange for prayers at shrines and temples, and be prepared to reward anyone who accomplished anything. Even though it wasn't a real war, they also decided to have prayers performed at shrines and temples in the capital. One month after the original message Dazaifu sent word that 40 pirates had been captured and that the situation had been restored to normal.

Twenty-two years later, in 1019, there was a similar event that was more serious in nature, announced by another emergency messenger from Dazaifu. This one took 10 days. The previous messenger had needed 17 days. The message stated that a people called &quot;Toi&quot; had attacked Iki island with about 50 ships, killed the governor in battle, and captured many people. They then proceeded south and landed on the mainland of Kyushu. Sanesuke was sick that day and at home, but he received a private visit from the messenger who carried a letter from a friend of his who was at Dazaifu that provided details which are found in his diary.

The first response of the Dajokan was identical to that of 997 except that this invasion seemed larger and it was arranged to send messengers to all governors in provinces in the west telling them to gather forces and prepare to fight any invaders. Sanesuke was put in charge of this task and he went to the archives and looked up letters sent to governors in 893 and 894 when Korean pirates were a problem at the time of the collapse of the kingdom of Silla and its replacement by Koryo. He then copied those letters. This was shortly before the Gion festival and preparations for that continued as normal.

A few days later a second message arrived saying that the raiders had been defeated. It said that among the raiders captured were three Koreans who claimed that they were prisoners of the raiders. The Dajokan ordered that an investigation be held to find out whether the raiders were actually Koreans and not &quot;Toi&quot; barbarians as originally claimed. It also said that Dazaiful could handle all of this and there was no need to send prisoners to the capital. Dazaifu was urged to send troops to Iki and Tsushima to aid their defense. After that the Dajokan pretty much ignored the entire issue and the Gion Festival went off as scheduled.

However, in Kyushu this event was a major issue as the raiders did a lot of damage before they were driven off. They came in large boats described as being about 15 meters long on average with 30 or 40 oars and able to move very fast. Each carried 50 or 60 men. When they landed they combined the crews of different boats into companies of 100 men. 20 or 30 men would carry halberds or long swords, the rest were armed with bows. The total force that landed was between 1000 and 2000 men. All horses and cattle that were encountered were killed and eaten, as were dogs. They killed the old and weak and took healthy persons captive. They looted food and burned all houses. On Iki about 400 people were killed or taken prisoner.

When the raiders reached the Ito district on the north coast of Kyushu the local district magistrate raised a force of men and claimed to have killed several dozen of them. The raiding force proceeded to Dazaifu itself and attempted to capture it. There was a desperate battle and they were eventually driven off. During the fighting Japanese prisoners aboard some of the beached ships called to nearby Japanese soldiers and told them that all of the able bodied men were fighting on shore and only the sick had been left to guard the boats. These men then attacked the boats and rescued many of the prisoners. 

It was reported that the enemy arrows were short but their bows were very stong and men who did not have shields were often killed or wounded. On the other hand, Japanese war arrows had arrowheads that were designed to make a loud noise in flight and these appears to frighten the raiders. 

For two days after the fight at Dazaifu the weather was bad and there was no fighting. The Japanese took the opportunity to try to scrounge up boats they could use. They were then able to send out a squadron of 37 boats to search for raiders. They found beached ships at Ito and attacked them, capturing 40. Then the raiders appeared a few miles further west, around Matsuura, where they were resisted by the locals. They were no longer seen after that.

The results were then totaled up. 365 Japanese were killed and 1289 were taken captive. 380 horses and cattle were killed. Most of the casualties were on Iki island and the Ito district.

None of the surviving materials says anything about where the name Toi came from, but it is presumed to have been supplied by the Koreans. There is no certain knowledge as to where the raiders came from except that it was somewhere in the north, possibly Hokkaido, possibly eastern Siberia, possibly Manchuria north of the area controlled by the Korean kingdom. About 4 months after the attack a document showed up in Kyushu from the Korean government warning about Toi raiders who had attacked many places on the east coast of Korea, and two months after that a Korean fleet arrived in Kyushu to return 270 prisoners who had been rescued. 

During the attacks a man named Nagamine Morichika had been captured on Tsushima along with 9 other persons, members of his family and servants. They were carried along during the subsequent attack on Kyushu and passed by Tsushima on their way back north, where he was able to escape by jumping overboard and swimming ashore. After things had quieted down, he stole a small boat and proceeded to cross to Korea to attempt to find his family members. He came into contact with Korean armed forces. As the raiders passed the Korean coast a large Korean fleet went out to attack them and mostly wiped them out. When the raiders realized they were doomed they attempted to kill all of their captives. Many were thrown overboard and 300 of these were picked up by Korean ships. The rescued included no members of Morichika's family, but one of his servants was saved. Morichika knew that he had broken the law by leaving the country, and arranged with the Koreans an official appointment to lead a mission returning 10 captives. This party arrived several weeks before the Korean fleet carrying the bulk of the people who had been saved. Most of this information comes from interviews with three of the persons brought back by Morichika. Dazaifu officially recommended that Morichika be punished else others might think they could get away with breaking the law. It is not known what the central government decided to do.

As to the Korean fleet, Sanesuke recommended that it be driven away, but the Dajokan ruled that it had been proven that the raiders were Toi and the Koreans were only trying to help and should be treated well. The Korean commander was invited to Dazaifu and banqueted. It is mentioned that during this general period two Korean merchant ships showed up claiming to have been blown off course by storms. They were sent away and not permitted to trade (as they had apparently been hoping) and Japan returned to its customary isolation. 

These incidents do show that Japan maintained an official policy of refusing to deal with foreigners and especially Koreans, something that would otherwise not show in the record for this era. Given the thinness of government in Japan it is impossible that such a ban could have been enforced rigorously. It is entirely likely that in quieter times when the Dajokan was not thinking about Kyushu that the occasional Korean or Chinese ship was able to sneak in and do a bit of trading and that Japanese fishermen would be able to cross to Korea and do a little smuggling. There is no doubt that in the following century there was a significant amount of Chinese coinage in circulation in Japan and it had to have some way of getting in.

==Bandits etcetera==

In this part of the Heian period the appearance of unofficial writing in the form of diaries provides a lot of information about events that do not show up in surviving government documents. It is hard to tell how much conditions might have changed from the previous few generations because we don't have similar information about those periods, but it is notable that the government was clearly doing a rather poor job of taking care of security in the capital. It is possible to name a significant number of professional criminals and to give some detail about some of their exploits.

There were criminal gangs and there is one account of an event that looks very much like gang warfare, in which a group of armed men surrounded a house in the poor section of the city and massacred the inhabitants. This happened on a day when the Emperor was being taken to visit a shrine so that most of the police must have been involved with the procession. A common tactic of the gangs was to set fire to a mansion and then break in during the resulting confusion to steal as much as they could grab. Michinaga himself was once robbed of a considerable quantity of gold and silver in what looked like an inside job involving his servants. The police put a lot of effort into this case and arrested a number of men two weeks later in Harima province and recovered a considerable portion of what had been taken. Robbers were encountered inside the imperial palace on numerous occasions, and in one incident two ladies in waiting were attacked and robbed of their finery.

Our newspapers are full every day of incidents of robbery and violence. Someone took the trouble of cataloging known incidents for the first 4 months of 1019. There were 10 instances of major fires including one definitely set by robbers in which one woman died, the only reported casualty. There were two instances of daylight robbery by gangs of armed men, one group broke into a mansion, the other rampaged in the streets. One woman was robbed inside the imperial palace by a man who threatened her with a sword. These are just the incidents that made surviving diary entries. 

In some sense all this really means is that Kyoto had become a real city in which the kinds of things happened that happen in all cities. However, the brazenness of the armed gangs and the clear lack of security even in the imperial palace indicate that the police forces were not nearly large enough to maintain a reasonable degree of order. The handling of the wars with Sumitomo and Masakado and the response in Kyushu to the raids of 977 and 1019 show that the government no longer had the resources to field properly organized military forces. The wealthier men living in the countryside were all armed and they dealt with incidents that arose by forming themselves and their servants into improptu militia units. The same applies to policing. All of the nobles had walls around their mansions and considerable numbers of servants and also owned estates in the countryside near the capital from which they were able to import additional servants when they needed them, such as for construction projects. They provided their own security. In that roundup of incidents in early 1019 it is mentioned that when a nearby mansion was set afire one of the leading nobles posted armed servants on the roof of his own mansion to keep watch all night long.

Ever since the latter part of the 9th century delegations of farmers had come to the capital to protest against crooked governors and other things that bothered them. They continued to do this through the time of Michinaga. When it eventually stopped that was a sign that the government had become so ineffective as to be unnoticeable to such people. 1019 affords an interesting example based on entries in Sanesuke's diary. A delegation of farmers arrived from Tamba province, just north of the capital and part of modern Kyoyo Prefecture, to hand in a petition against the governor Fujiwara Yorito. Yorito was in the capital and presumably was relying on a zuryo to manage the province. They gathered outside a gate of the palace and since the officials inside refused to accept their petition, they came back day after day. After 5 days, without warning, soldiers on horseback appeared and attempted to arrest the farmers, who scattered. 10 of them ran into the palace and sought shelter in various offices. When Michinaga and Yorimichi heard about this they loudly denounced Yorito and dismissed him from his post. A few days later the farmers reassembled and Michinaga retracted the firing and ordered Yorito to go out to his province. Sanesuke was amused at this because it seems Michinaga had been forced to change his mind, something that didn't happen often. Then just two months later the farmers were back. Sanesuke was astounded to discover that this time they wanted to hand in a document praising Yorito as a good governor, or at least better than the zuryo. My guess is that Yorito spotted an opportunity and grabbed it. This was a period when middle ranking nobles from the capital were beginning to be squeezed out as the number of salaried posts continued to shrink. Many governors started to go to their provinces again and quite frequently failed to return. They made connections, married into a powerful local family, and settled down. This practice is reflected in ''Genji Monogatari'' also. There was an incident involving a different governor of Tamba in 1023 and that man also was out in his province when it happened.

      <comment>moved [[Talk:Parallel Processing Theory and Application]] to [[Talk:Parallel Computing and Computer Clusters/Theory]]: History merge.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi all,

I didn't realise this module existed until the suggestion of the merge appeared on the front of both books.  The search engine on Wikibooks doesn't seem to do itself any justice: I've checked the history on this page as I wondered just how old it is - despite it's age I still can't find it through the search!  I did, however, find it through the Google search option. :(

Anyway, it appears that there's four of us so far:

*[[Parallel Processing Theory and Application]]
*[[Parallel Computing and Computer Clusters/Software]]
*[[Computer programming/Concurrent programming]]
*&lt;strike&gt;[[Programmable Logic/Parallel Execution]]&lt;/strike&gt;

I wonder if it would be worth making a concerted effort between all? --[[User:Barthax|Barthax]] 08:01, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

:The [[Programmable Logic/Parallel Execution]] thing, while named in a similar manner, is about a different topic. That module is about the parallel execution of different physical modules in a single programmable logic chip. The rest of the modules you have listed can probably be merged into a single book, as far as i can tell. I put the merge notice on this book yesterday, so i do think that this needs to get merged. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:51, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi all,

There are a couple of books covering Parallel issues elsewhere on Wikibooks which cover a very similar topic to this one.  It has been suggested that these other two books are merged.  As the subject matter on this chapter of your book has distinct overlaps with the suggested merge, perhaps you could join the discussion over at [[Talk:Parallel Processing Theory and Application]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Reverse Engineering Chapter}}

== Protection Mechanisms ==
Not many good protective measures are available to programmers to prevent most overflow vulnerabilities. However, something can be done.

=== Bounds Checking ===
New languages such as Java and C# make such a big deal over their &quot;automatic bounds checking&quot; and &quot;memory management&quot; features mainly because they help prevent stack overflows (with a small performance penalty).
C programmers however are left to their own devices, and need to explicitly test the bounds on every array. It's tedious, but at least crackers won't break your program, and then you won't get fired from your job.

=== Canary / Cookie ===
Some compilers help out by building in a flag value called a '''canary''' or '''cookie''' on the stack usually just above the pushed frame pointer and the return address (think of the caged bird used in coal mines to detect the buildup of poisonous gases before the workers could get intoxicated).

 push CANARY
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 sub esp, 100

Now, when the function wants to return, we can perform the following operation:

 add esp, 100
 mov esp, ebp
 pop ebp
 pop ebx ;canary value
 cmp ebx, CANARY
 jne _STACK_ERROR_FOUND
 ret

This way we can detect if the stack has been overwritten, because the Canary value has changed.
A predictable Canary value however is vulnerable: attackers that insert that value onto the stack as part of their overflow data elude detection. For this reason most Canary values are randomly generated at run-time. Many Canary values also contain ''two'' null characters at the start or end: string copy functions (like '''strcpy''' or '''wcscpy''') stop copying data after reaching and writing a null char; if the nulls are instead omitted by the attacker the overflow will be caught.

This method of protection can catch basic overflows, and prevent a function from returning to a modified address and execute arbitrary code. However the subroutine still gets executed – with compromised internal state and variables – since the overflow get detected only when it returns.
This can still be exploited by an attacker: for example, a memory pointer variable can be modified to point to an arbitary location. If the subroutine then uses this pointer to write to memory, it could overwrite anything in the program’s address space.

=== Pointer Sanity ===

Many heap overflows become effective by overwriting the housekeeping data at the start of the next heap chunk, which normally contains at least one [[wikipedia:Linked list|linked list]]. Allocating or freeing an overwritten chunk can cause data to be written at an arbitary address in memory. Most heap systems now check the data pointed to by linked lists, to ensure that they point at another heap chunk or valid data.

This method of protection is also present in the Microsoft Windows &quot;Structured Exception Handling&quot; routines. Before calling an exception handler (the pointer to which resides on the stack, and can be overwritten), it is first checked to ensure that the routine resides within an executable section of memory. If the handler routine does not, then it is not called.

== Safe String Libraries ==

Because the standard library string functions are the common cause of stack overflows, a number of libraries with &quot;safe&quot; string functions have appeared to try to address this problem. Most of them require an explicit “string length” parameter in their functions’ arguments, and limit the data copied to that amount.

The programmer must obviously still be careful and enter accurate string length values; sloppy programming can still cause trouble.

=== Exercises ===

We will leave as an exercise for the reader to write a set of safe string functions, that take a length parameter, and perform simple bounds-checking to prevent overflow. Another option would be to take as an argument a pointer to a &quot;maximum&quot; stack position, and compare pointers to prevent overflow.

Hello everyone. My name is Harmony Ng, a chinese girl living in Hong Kong.  I would like to start a wikibook here, but I'm still figuring the way how to do it!
I am going to post up issues which I think it is interesting and my own interpretations and inspirations.  I hope the materials I provide would be helpful to anybody browsing wikipedia.
However, in the meantime, please wait for my masterpiece! :p

Feel free to email me for any comments (please be friendly, haha)

I just wanted to let you know that the [[Reverse Engineering]] book was nominated for Collaboration of the Month. We could use all the votes we can get, so if you don't mind casting a vote in favor of it, i would be much appreciative. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, I saw that on the main page. I looked at the rules though, something about having to have twenty contributions before voting. I'll still chip in at some point, i'm just a stickler for the rules. However, i'm not sure that there are enough people out there with detailed knowledge on the topic to help out. [[User:Hexed321|Hexed321]] 22:34, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

:Well, whether there are enough people or not, the [[Reverse Engineering]] book was elected COTM for August.

As GNOME is only an Operating System (Linux) Desktop Environment, it comes with the &quot;standard&quot;1 Linux web browser, Mozilla Firefox by default. 

1. Standard being embedded into the operating system.

Only just learning about this at Meadowbank TAFE so feel free to correct anything that may need it.

I've moved each section of the page to its respective chapter, so that this section of Ancient History follows the same format as the rest of the book will. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 19:47, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

==Definitions==
===Hypertension===
Hypertension, as defined by the ''Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure'' (JNC 7), is defined as the systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 90 mmHg. In order to diagnose a patient with hypertension, the blood pressure must be above these levels for the average of at least two separate readings in a seated patient on at least two separate office visits.

JNC 7 defines two stages of hypertension:
*Stage I: SBP 140-159 mmHg and/or DBP 90-99 mmHg
*Stage II: SBP &gt;= 160 mmHg and/or DBP &gt;= 100 mmHg

===Hypertensive Urgency===
Hypertensive ''urgency'' is defined as severe hypertension '''without''' acute evidence of target organ damage/dysfunction (CNS, cardiovascular, renal).

===Hypertensive Emergency===
Hypertensive '''''emergency''''' is defined as severe hypertension '''with''' evidence of acute target organ damage/dysfunction. Treatment always requires IV medication and reduction of blood pressure within one hour.
*Note: a patient does not necessarily have to carry a previous diagnosis of hypertension to present with hypertensive emergency!

==Etiology==
In most cases, the exact cause of hypertension is never found, and the hypertension is said to be &quot;essential&quot;. There are, however, several reversible and correctible causes that should be searched out and eliminated if at all possible.

These include: 
*Drug use
**OTC sinus preparations
**[[Emergency Medicine/Hallucinogens|PCP]]
**[[Emergency Medicine/Amphetamines|Amphetamines]]
**[[Emergency Medicine/Cocaine|Cocaine]]
**Oral contraceptives
*Drug withdrawals
**Beta blockers
**Alpha2 agonists
*Renal Artery Stenosis
*Pheochromocytoma
*[[Emergency Medicine/Congenital Abnormalities of the Cardiovascular System|Aortic coarctation]]
*Cushing Syndrome/Disease
*Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia
*Hyperaldosteronism

==Diagnosis==
===History===
Historical account should focus on the presence or absence of organ damage/dysfunction (see below), any previous history of hypertension, current medications, and ruling in/out the above etiologic factors.

Specifically ask about: 
*Back pain - Aortic dissection
*Chest pain - Myocardial infarction or ischemia
*Dyspnea - Pulmonary edema, CHF
*Neurologic symptoms - headache, visual disturbances, altered level of consciousness, seizures 
**Symptoms of Encephalopathy


===Examination===
Vital signs: Should be monitored every 5-10 minutes if hypertensive emergency is considered.

General: Level of consciousness, fluency of speech

HEENT: Funduscopic exam should be performed looking for papilledema, new exudates, and flame hemorrhages.

Cardiovascular: Look for signs of long standing hypertension and acute cardiovascular dysfunction
* Heaves
* Displacement of the PMI
* Carotid bruits
* Elevated JVP
* Peripheral edema

Pulmonary: Evaluate for signs of CHF
* Crackles
* Wheezes
* Accessory muscle use/retractions

Abdomen: Assess for bruits or pulsatile masses

Neurologic: Look for signs of hypertensive encephalopathy
* Altered level of consciousness
* Acute confusional states/delirium
* Visual field deficits
* Focal deficits, either centrally or peripherally

===Imaging/Lab Studies===

BMP, CBC, UA, Tox studies (if indicated)

EKG should be performed if chest pain or dyspnea is present

Chest radiographs may be indicated if there is chest pain or dyspnea

Head CT is indicated if there are focal neurological findings

==Treatment==
===Hypertensive Urgency===
Treatment of hypertensive urgency involves reducing the blood pressure to normal or near-normal levels within 24 to 48 hours. These patients, who do not have any objective evidence of end-organ damage, may be discharged on oral anti-hypertensives with close follow-up at their primary physician's office within the next 2-3 days.

===Hypertensive Emergency===
Hypertensive emergency requires rapid BP lowering and admission to a step-down unit or the ICU. General principles include reducing the mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 20% in 1-2 hours with IV anti-hypertensives, including nitroprusside, nitroglycerin or IV beta-blockers. Afterwards, the blood pressure should be brought to 160/100 over the next 6-8 hours.

==Transmission==
This page is being added to by attendees from a conference on video distribution on the internet. 

Http://www.transmission.cc

We wanted to make our resources available to those outside our loose network, and this seemed a good place. {{unsigned}}
:Did the international film database (for independent screeners) ever come to fruition? [[User:CMBJ|CMBJ]] ([[User talk:CMBJ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/CMBJ|contribs]]) 12:16, 13 April 2014 (UTC)

== Links and organization ==

There are three modules linked to only by this book:
* [[Video Production/Convergence and collaboration model]]
* [[Video Production/Independent Online Video Distribution]]
* [[Video Production/Basic Virtual Dub Xvid]]

Are these pages chapters or appendices of this book? If so, please rename these pages to begin with &quot;Video/&quot; via the &quot;move&quot; link at the top of every page. I don't recommend linking to separate chapters only from within other chapters, but rather from an ordered table of contents. If the links are separate books, please be prepared to turn them into academic textbooks. Encyclopedic content would normally go on our sister project, [[w:|Wikipedia]], although it would be allowed in the form of appendices. 

Secondly, will this textbook discuss all aspects of video or only video production? Since &quot;video&quot; is a broad subject, I recommend renaming this book to a more descriptive title, such as [[Video Production]] (again, via the &quot;move&quot; link at the top of the page).

One other suggestion I have is to change your website links to go to Wikipedia articles instead. Typing &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Google Video|Google Video]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, for example, produces [[w:Google Video|Google Video]]. You might also be interested in reading a user's [[User:Whiteknight/New Book Guide|New Book Guide]]. Good luck on your project, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 04:02, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

==Comment about RfD Survival==
While the book survived the request for deletion, it seemed agreed by all that this book is in need of heavy clean up, and should be &quot;nearly nuked&quot;.  If it does not improve it can be (and almost certainly will) be nominated for deletion again. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:16, 8 July 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">WireHose provides a powerful, flexible foundation for building content management systems in WebObjects, based on the concept of tagging and indexing content.

== Tags ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHTag.html WHTag]&lt;/b&gt; objects represent metadata which can be arranged in an arbitrary hierarchy and assigned to taggable objects. Tags can be arranged into any hierarchy required. A tag can be uniquely identified by its tagpath, which is a slash-delimited string indicating its position in the hierarchy such as &quot;Animals/Cats/Black cats/Budu&quot;. You use static methods in WHTag create and retrieve tags, and assign them to taggable objects. You can subclass WHTag to implement access control, workflow or other special applications. 
The &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/engage/package-summary.html com.wirehose.base.engage]&lt;/b&gt; package defines several WHTag subclasses which implement access control for taggable objects. 
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHRevision.html WHRevision]&lt;/b&gt; is a WHTag subclass which provides support for versioning taggable objects.

== Taggable objects ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHTaggable.html WHTaggable]&lt;/b&gt; defines an interface for objects which can be categorized and fetched by tags. A taggable object can have any number of tags. You can add taggable support to your existing enterprise object entities by adding a few relationships and implementing the WHTaggable interface, which provides a default implementation as a static inner class. WireHose also includes Xcode templates to create new taggable objects from scratch.

== Indexable objects ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHIndexable.html WHIndexable]&lt;/b&gt; defines an interface for objects which can be indexed and fetched by keywords. You can add indexable support to your existing enterprise object entities by implementing the WHIndexable interface and adding a few relationships. WireHose also includes Xcode templates to create new indexable objects from scratch. Indexable objects are indexed through the '''[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/_util/WHTextIndexer.html WHTextIndexer]''' utility class.

== Fetching taggable and indexable objects ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHTagDataSource.html WHTagDataSource]&lt;/b&gt; is an EODataSource, suitable for use with display groups, which fetches taggable and indexable objects by tags and keywords. WHTagDataSource is optimized for performance, and includes fine-tunable caching and entity pruning so expensive fetches are minimized. You can filter fetched objects by entity or interfaces implemented, and control its SQL generation through several Java properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to create Xvid files from DV avi files in Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

        &lt;h2 align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Xvid files are often used to convert DVD files to fit 
          on a CD. They are commonly used to put up big files on Indymedia or 
          similar sites. The file size is quite flexible you can create files 
          that are suitable for screenings which are between 3 Meg and 15 Meg 
          per minute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;You will need to install&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;* Virtual dub mod -&lt;/b&gt; http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=65889&lt;br&gt;
           - it has an installer for windows. &lt;br&gt;

          &lt;br&gt;
          &lt;b&gt;* Lame mp3 Codec&lt;/b&gt; -&lt;br&gt;
          http://www.free-codecs.com/Lame_Encoder_download.htm
&lt;br&gt; [the stable version - to install unzip the *.zip file, find the 
          lame*.inf in the file - right hand click it and select &amp;quot;Install&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
          &lt;br&gt;
          &lt;b&gt;* Panasonic DV codec - &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

         http://www.free-codecs.com/download/Panasonic_DV_Codec.htm&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;- Uncompress the files from pdvcodec.zip archive, right-click 
          on the PANADV.INF file and select Install.&lt;br&gt;
          - You may encounter a prompt saying: &amp;quot;The software you are installing 
          for this hardware... has not passed Windows Logo testing...&amp;quot;; click 
          on the Continue Anyway button.&lt;br&gt;
          - You should now be able to load DV-AVI Type-2 files with VirtualDub 
          (and any other program that loads AVI files). &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;* Xvid Codec -&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;/b&gt;http://www.free-codecs.com/download/XviD_Media_Codec.htm - this also has an installer so it's easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;How to do it&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
          Open Virtual dub Mod and open the DV avi file you have saved from your 
          video project / or created from a DVD / or the avs/d2v file from using 
          Gordian Knot. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;File &amp;gt; Open [browse for the file]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Video&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Select Video &amp;gt; Compression . &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You willl get a list of the different codecs on your pc. Choose Xvid 
          which should be there. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Select Xvid and then Click on Configure on the right&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To make this super easy we are going to do one pass encoding, and select 
          a preset that looks ok for CDroms. At the bottom of the pages click 
          Default Settings. Then click on the Target Quantizer Button. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:vid_xvidsettings1.gif]]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This should bring up the next setting. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:vid_xvidsettings.gif]]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This datarate setting (700 kbps) is OK. It creates a file about 8-9 Meg for
           one minute of footage. But with modern broadband and computer speeds,
           we recommend 1600 kbps.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Click OK&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then you need to add a filter to de-interlace your video if it 
          is interlaced - which is normal for dv avis exported from premiere or 
          similar. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:addfilter.gif]]/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Click ADD and select the deinterlace filter. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:deintfilter.gif]]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When given an option select the &amp;quot;Blend&amp;quot; option. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Resize your clip, using the resize filter, as 640 x 480 for 4:3,
           or 800 x 480 for 16:9.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Audio&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now we deal with the Audio. This is a &amp;quot;Stream&amp;quot; so we go to 
          the Stream menu and select Stream list. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:audiostream.gif]] &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If your source video file has audio it should be listed as a grey bar 
          with information as seen below. [if you are using Gordian Knot to do 
          this process from a DVD you will need to click ADD and browse for the 
          *.wav file created in that process]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:streamlist.gif]]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Right hand Click on this bar and select &amp;quot;Full Processing mode&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Then Right hand click again and Select &amp;quot;Compression&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:conversion.gif]]&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If Conversion is greyed out it's because you haven't selected full 
          processing mode. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You get a list of audio codecs installed on your system, Click on Mpeg 
          Layer 3 - which is mp3. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Choose 48,000 khz, and 128 kps, stereo as a standard thing. If you 
          don't get enough options then you need a) click the show all formats 
          box or b) reinstall your mp3 codec, get the LAME one, it's free. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:mp3options.gif]] &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Click OK, then OK again at the Stream list menu. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You are ready to save your file. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;File &amp;gt; Save as Avi &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Often it's a good idea to give it a full name for file sharing purposes 
          with the codecs you used. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;indymedia_russia_solidarity_action_2005_mp3_xvid.avi&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This is to make it easier for other people to know if it is worth watching. 
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;[[Image:save_as.gif]] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More advanced Encoding&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Below is a quick description of how to do 2-pass encoding with Virtual-Dub 
          provided by Matthew Coulson:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; * In the Xvid codec dialog, choose 2pass 1st pass. (Do this just before 
          you are about to save the file).&lt;br&gt;
          * Then, in VDub, select save as, type in any old filename, checkmark 
          the box underneath that says &amp;quot;Add operation to Jobs List and defer 
          processing&amp;quot;, and click &amp;quot;Save&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;

          * Now, back in VDub, go back into the Xvid codec, choose 2pass 2nd pass&lt;br&gt;
          * Do the same thing to save it - type in the proper filename this time, 
          checkmark the &amp;quot;Add to Jobs List&amp;quot; box again, and click &amp;quot;Save&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;
          * Now click on File, Job Control, and you should see the two jobs you've 
          just created&lt;br&gt;
          * Click on Start, and VDub will go off and process the two, and you'll 
          end up with the two files specified.&lt;br&gt;

          * You can delete the first one, and keep the second. Compare it to a 
          1pass encode and you will notice the difference&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

'''Dirt pudding''' is a dessert creation consisting primarily of [[cookbook:pudding|pudding]] ([[cookbook:vanilla|vanilla]] or [[cookbook:chocolate|chocolate]]) and Oreo cookies, with some recipes including gummy worms. This quick and easy dessert can be made in less than five minutes and is ready to eat in about one hour.

== Ingredients ==

* 3½ cups (840ml) cold [[cookbook:milk|milk]]
* 2 pkgs. (4 serving size) vanilla Instant Pudding
* 1 12 oz tub (320g) Whipped Topping, thawed
* 1 16 oz pkg. (450g) Chocolate sandwich cookies, crushed

== Procedure ==

HINT: Crush cookies in zipper-style plastic bag with [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] or in [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]].

Make the pudding as directed on the package using 3½ cups (840ml) milk; let stand 5 minutes. Stir 3 cups of the whipped topping and ½ of the crushed cookies into the pudding OR alternate layers of crushed cookies and pudding/whipped topping. Spoon it into any bowl or dish of your choice. Sprinkle the top with the remaining crushed cookies. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

{{info|This page is kept mostly for historical and attribution purposes. Its approach was strongly coupled to an older version of [[Haskell/Understanding monads|Understanding monads]], and the restructuring of that subchapter made it largely redundant. Most of the contents were incorporated to the Understanding monads subpages.}} 

== Monads as computations ==

As far as the usage of monads in Haskell is concerned, our introductory discussion in [[Haskell/Understanding monads|Understanding monads]] boils down to view that each monad represents a ''different type of computation''. Here, and in the rest of this chapter, a 'computation' is simply a function call: we're computing the result of this function. In a minute, we'll give some examples to explain what we mean by this, but first, let's recapitulate the role of the basic monadic operators:

=== &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; ===
The &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; operator is used to ''sequence two monadic computations''. That means it combines them so that when the combined computation is run, the first computation will run and its output will be fed into the second which will then run using (or dependent upon) that value.

=== &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; ===
&lt;code&gt;return x&lt;/code&gt;, in computation-speak, is simply a computation that, when run, will produce the result &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as-is, but in its own (the computation's) specific way. The meaning of the latter phrase will become clearer when we look at State below.

So how does the computations analogy work in practice? Let's look at some examples.

== The Maybe monad ==

Computations in the Maybe monad (that is, function calls which result in a type wrapped up in a Maybe) represent ''computations that might fail''. The easiest example is with lookup tables. A lookup table is a table which relates ''keys'' to ''values''. You ''look up'' a value by knowing its key and using the lookup table. For example, you might have a lookup table of contact names as keys to their phone numbers as the values in a phonebook application. One way of implementing lookup tables in Haskell is to use a list of pairs: &lt;code&gt;[(a, b)]&lt;/code&gt;. Here &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is the type of the keys, and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; the type of the values. Here's how the phonebook lookup table might look:

 phonebook :: [(String, String)]
 phonebook = [ (&quot;Bob&quot;,   &quot;01788 665242&quot;),
               (&quot;Fred&quot;,  &quot;01624 556442&quot;),
               (&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;01889 985333&quot;),
               (&quot;Jane&quot;,  &quot;01732 187565&quot;) ]

The most common thing you might do with a lookup table is look up values! However, this computation might fail. Everything's fine if we try to look up one of &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Fred&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot; or &quot;Jane&quot; in our phonebook, but what if we were to look up &quot;Zoe&quot;? Zoe isn't in our phonebook, so the lookup has failed. Hence, the Haskell function to look up a value from the table is a &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; computation:

 lookup :: Eq a =&gt; a  -- a key
        -&gt; [(a, b)]   -- the lookup table to use
        -&gt; Maybe b    -- the result of the lookup

Lets explore some of the results from lookup:

 Prelude&gt; lookup &quot;Bob&quot; phonebook
 Just &quot;01788 665242&quot;
 Prelude&gt; lookup &quot;Jane&quot; phonebook
 Just &quot;01732 187565&quot;
 Prelude&gt; lookup &quot;Zoe&quot; phonebook
 Nothing

Now let's expand this into using the full power of the monadic interface. Say, we're now working for the government, and once we have a phone number from our contact, we want to look up this phone number in a big, government-sized lookup table to find out the registration number of their car. This, of course, will be another &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;-computation. But if they're not in our phonebook, we certainly won't be able to look up their registration number in the governmental database! So what we need is a function that will take the results from the first computation, and put it into the second lookup, but only if we didn't get &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; the first time around. If we ''did'' indeed get &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; from the first computation, or if we get &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; from the second computation, our final result should be &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt;.

 comb :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
 comb Nothing  _ = Nothing
 comb (Just x) f = f x

Observant readers may have guessed where we're going with this one. That's right, comb is just &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, but restricted to Maybe-computations. So we can chain our computations together:

 getRegistrationNumber :: String       -- their name
                       -&gt; Maybe String -- their registration number
 getRegistrationNumber name = 
   lookup name phonebook &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
     (\number -&gt; lookup number governmentalDatabase)

If we then wanted to use the result from the governmental database lookup in a third lookup (say we want to look up their registration number to see if they owe any car tax), then we could extend our &lt;code&gt;getRegistrationNumber&lt;/code&gt; function:

 getTaxOwed :: String       -- their name
            -&gt; Maybe Double -- the amount of tax they owe
 getTaxOwed name = 
   lookup name phonebook &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
     (\number -&gt; lookup number governmentalDatabase) &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
       (\registration -&gt; lookup registration taxDatabase)

Or, using the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt;-block style:

 getTaxOwed name = do
   number       &lt;- lookup name phonebook
   registration &lt;- lookup number governmentalDatabase
   lookup registration taxDatabase

Let's just pause here and think about what would happen if we got a &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; anywhere. Trying to use &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; to combine a &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; from one computation with another function will result in the &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; being carried on and the second function ignored (refer to our definition of comb above if you're not sure). That is, a &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; at ''any stage'' in the large computation will result in a &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; overall, regardless of the other functions! Thus we say that the structure of the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad ''propagates failures''.

An important thing to note is that we're not by any means restricted to lookups! There are many, many functions whose results could fail and therefore use &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;. You've probably written one or two yourself. Any computations in &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; can be combined in this way.

=== Summary ===
The important features of the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; monad are that:

# It represents computations that could fail.
# It propagates failure.

== The List monad ==

Computations that are in the list monad (that is, they end in a type [a]) represent ''computations with zero or more valid answers''. For example, say we are modelling the game of noughts and crosses (known as tic-tac-toe in some parts of the world). An interesting (if somewhat contrived) problem might be to find all the possible ways the game could progress: find the possible states of the board 3 turns later, given a certain board configuration (i.e. a game in progress).

Here is the instance declaration for the list monad:

 instance Monad [] where
   return a = [a]
   xs &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; f = concat (map f xs)

As monads are only really useful when we're chaining computations together, let's go into more detail on our example. The problem can be boiled down to the following steps:

# Find the list of possible board configurations for the next turn.
# Repeat the computation for each of these configurations: replace each configuration, call it ''C'', with the list of possible configurations of the turn after ''C''.
# We will now have a list of lists (each sublist representing the turns after a previous configuration), so in order to be able to repeat this process, we need to collapse this list of lists into a single list.

This structure should look similar to the monadic instance declaration above. Here's how it might look, without using the list monad:

 getNextConfigs :: Board -&gt; [Board]
 getNextConfigs = undefined -- details not important

 tick :: [Board] -&gt; [Board]
 tick bds = concatMap getNextConfigs bds

 find3rdConfig :: Board -&gt; [Board]
 find3rdConfig bd = tick $ tick $ tick [bd]

(&lt;code&gt;concatMap&lt;/code&gt; is a handy function for when you need to concat the results of a map: &lt;code&gt;concatMap f xs = concat (map f xs)&lt;/code&gt;.) Alternatively, we could define this with the list monad:

 find3rdConfig :: Board -&gt; [Board]
 find3rdConfig bd0 = do
   bd1 &lt;- getNextConfigs bd0
   bd2 &lt;- getNextConfigs bd1
   bd3 &lt;- getNextConfigs bd2
   return bd3

=== List comprehensions ===
An interesting thing to note is how similar list comprehensions and the list monad are. For example, the classic function to find [[w:Pythagorean_triple|Pythagorean triples]]:

 pythags = [ (x, y, z) | z &lt;- [1..], x &lt;- [1..z], y &lt;- [x..z], x^2 + y^2 == z^2 ]

This can be directly translated to the list monad:

 import Control.Monad (guard)
 
 pythags = do
   z &lt;- [1..]
   x &lt;- [1..z]
   y &lt;- [x..z]
   guard (x^2 + y^2 == z^2)
   return (x, y, z)

The only non-trivial element here is &lt;code&gt;guard&lt;/code&gt;. This is explained in the next module, [[../MonadPlus|Additive monads]].

== The State monad ==

The State monad actually makes a lot more sense when viewed as a computation, rather than a container. Computations in State represents computations that ''depend on and modify some internal state''. For example, say you were writing a program to model the [[w:Three body problem#Three-body problem|three body problem]]. The internal state would be the positions, masses and velocities of all three bodies. Then a function, to, say, get the acceleration of a specific body would need to reference this state as part of its calculations.

The other important aspect of computations in State is that they can modify the internal state. Again, in the three-body problem, you could write a function that, given an acceleration for a specific body, updates its position.

The State monad is quite different from the Maybe and the list monads, in that it doesn't represent the ''result'' of a computation, but rather a certain property of the computation itself.

What we do is model computations that depend on some internal state as functions which take a state parameter. For example, if you had a function &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, and we want to modify it to make it depend on some internal state of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, then the function becomes &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; s -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;. To allow the function to change the internal state, the function returns a pair of (return value, new state). So our function becomes &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; s -&gt; (Bool, s)&lt;/code&gt;

It should be clear that this method is a bit cumbersome. However, the types aren't the worst of it: what would happen if we wanted to run two stateful computations, call them &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, one after another, passing the result of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;? The second would need to be passed the new state from running the first computation, so we end up 'threading the state':

 fThenG :: (s -&gt; (a, s)) -&gt; (a -&gt; s -&gt; (b, s)) -&gt; s -&gt; (b, s)
 fThenG f g s =
   let (v,  s' ) = f s    -- run f with our initial state s.
       (v', s&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) = g v s' -- run g with the new state s' and the result of f, v.
   in (v', s&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)           -- return the latest state and the result of g

All this 'plumbing' can be nicely hidden by using the State monad. The type constructor &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; takes two type parameters: the type of its environment (internal state), and the type of its output. (Even though the new state comes ''last'' in the result pair, the state type must come ''first'' in the type parameters, since the 'real' monad is bound to some particular type of state but lets the result type vary.) So &lt;code&gt;State s a&lt;/code&gt; indicates a stateful computation which depends on, and can modify, some internal state of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, and has a result of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. How is it defined? Well, simply as a function that takes some state and returns a pair of (value, new state):

 newtype State s a = State (s -&gt; (a, s))

The above example of &lt;code&gt;fThenG&lt;/code&gt; is, in fact, the definition of &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for the State monad, which you probably remember from the first monads chapter.

=== The meaning of return ===
We mentioned earlier that &lt;code&gt;return x&lt;/code&gt; was the computation that 'did nothing' and just returned &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. This idea only really starts to take on any meaning in monads with side-effects, like State. That is, computations in State have the opportunity to change the outcome of later computations by modifying the internal state. It's a similar situation with IO (because, of course, IO is just a special case of State). 

&lt;code&gt;return x&lt;/code&gt; doesn't do this. A computation produced by &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; generally won't have any side-effects. The monad law &lt;tt&gt;return x &gt;&gt;= f == f x&lt;tt&gt; basically guarantees this, for most uses of the term 'side-effect'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">WireHose provides everything you need to create high-performance, scalable personalized applications. It models users, guest users, channels, global channels, and channel factories, and includes optimized implementations which handle caching and propagation of default settings to individual sessions.

== Users ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHUser.html WHUser]&lt;/b&gt; is the parent entity for all WireHose users. It includes many methods for fetching, sorting and filtering a user's channels. Subclasses can override the &lt;code&gt;allUserChannels&lt;/code&gt; method to include channels which are not modeled as part of the base &quot;channels&quot; relationship. Users can be automatically logged in via cookies, and you can override the default authentication and guest user creation behavior by implementing &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/layout/WHApplicationHelper.html WHApplicationHelper]&lt;/b&gt;'s delegate methods.

== Channels ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHChannel.html WHChannel]&lt;/b&gt; defines an interface for things which can be personalized for individual users. WireHose includes Xcode templates which use &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHConcreteChannel.html WHConcreteChannel]&lt;/b&gt; as a default implementation, or you can create your own channel objects by implementing the WHChannel interface. WireHose also provides support for global channels, which belong to all users.

== Channel factories ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHChannelFactory.html WHChannelFactory]&lt;/b&gt; defines an interface for objects which create channels for individual users and global channels. Channel factories also may provide default settings which can be overridden on a per-instance basis by individual channels. In a typical deployment scenario, channel factories are shared between all sessions in an application, and thus are often used to cache the results of expensive fetches. It includes a static inner class which provides a default implementation of the interface. WireHose includes Project Builder templates so new channel factories can be rapidly built.

== Fetchers ==
&lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHFetcher.html WHFetcher]&lt;/b&gt; defines an interface for objects which cache and filter the results of expensive fetches. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHConcreteFetcher.html WHConcreteFetcher]&lt;/b&gt; provides an abstract implementation of this interface as a channel. For maximum performance, fetcher channels will attempt to use their factories' fetch results rather than perform their own whenever possible. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHTagFetcher.html WHTagFetcher]&lt;/b&gt; is a fetcher which uses a &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHTagDataSource.html WHTagDataSource]&lt;/b&gt; to fetch taggable and indexable objects. &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHQualifierFetcher.html WHQualifierFetcher]&lt;/b&gt; uses a &lt;b&gt;[http://www.wirehose.com/developer/javadoc/com/wirehose/base/WHQualifierDataSource.html WHQualifierDataSource]&lt;/b&gt; to retrieve enterprise objects by arbitrary qualifiers, making it well-suited for creating enterprise information channels that personalize queries into non-WireHose databases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Whether to merge the books==

To merge these in their current state would possibly cause the focus of each to be lost. Excel would appear to display the beginnings of a very good &quot;Beginners Guide&quot;. It displays a good broad approach to the subject. Each of the other books mentioned are very specialized in their subject content and are more suitable to the advanced Excel user. --09:56, 28 June 2007 [[Rhys]] (R.Wilson).

Don't do the merge!  -- Tom
As a teacher of office applications merging developer level stuff with a simple listing of just some of Excel's functionality would preclude me pointing learners at this book.

do the merge! --Tim

I do not believe it should be merged.  The other wiki on excel (not the financial modelling) gives instructions for C++, while this page has a more &quot;in excel&quot; modification approach.

'''Object''' Financial Modelling is a buisiness thing. --[[User:68.149.31.252|68.149.31.252]] 03:39, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

== Maintain distinction between EXCEL usage and EXCEL-as-solutions-development-environment ==

whether or not roll up and merge together all available content on Excel is an issue worthy of debate; however, what concerns me is the need to explicitly identify whatever piece of content is either: (a) EXCEL usage or (b) EXCEL clever tricks or (c) MS Office automation or (d) EXCEL-as-solutions-development-environment...

perhaps, viewing it as a multi-volume set, with each major topic as the focus for a given volume...?

howard_nyc@yahoo.com


Merging Excel tips into Excel will have to happen. But better than that is to expand the current section on Excel and then merge the Excel tips as content into the expanded Excel book. I have not need Excel for financial analysis. But looking at the title, i think its quite distinct. If all it does is to discuss Financial formulae in Excel, then i think it should be merged into a future expanded Excel book. - Muralidhar M S

dont merge the sections. financial modelling using Excel exists at the intersection of 2 major specialisations being IT (covering vanilla topic e.g &quot;how to use Excel&quot;) and finance (being the financial modelling specialism). It is inappropriate to put this topic on the IT shelf exclusively. Rather have a link from the appropriate business and Excel wiki's to this topic.

Agreed

MS Excel is a tool. Like, a BUS can be used to carry people, carry cattles,carry equipments, etc.
The basic guidence for running a bus is same but it needs drivers with specific experience to carry specific loads. A driver with experience in carrying equipments in logistics can't be expected to drive a bus full of school children, equally deftly. Yes one can learn in proper time, although !!!
