      <text xml:space="preserve">With the advent of e-Commerce, or online business there have been a number of streamlining effects on the method that companies, and individuals can conduct business.

If company chooses to create a web page listing its products or services no longer is a store needed to showcase your wares, or a staff needed to man the office. If the company deals in physical inventory there will still need to be a place to store it and process online orders but a large portion of overhead can be eliminated. An example of a company like this would be Amazon.com, which doesn't have any physical stores. If a company deals entirely in products of the digital sort, like say iTunes, then there is no storage space needed at all. Simply a room somewhere with a computer, or lots of computers, and a staff to oversee them.

There are a proliferation of small businesses online selling everything from T-Shirts to electronic media. Conceivably one such as the T-Shirt selling website could be run by a man in his Pyjamas surrounded by heaps of T-Shirts busily processing and mailing T-Shirts.

ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICES;

Online payment services are services that allow people to transfer money and pay bills via the Internet. These transactions can be provided to a local business or online businesses. PayPal (which is owned by EBay) is a commonly used service that people can use at various locations. This service can be used online to make purchases or transfer money. Most banks and businesses also offer online payment services.
Below is a sample screen for PayPal (an online payment service)


There are many different types of online payment forms. there is digital cash, pay pal, digital wallet, digital gift certificates, gift cards, and coupons among many more. Digital payment is much more popular and the popularity is growing and growing. The necessity for this is big. Digital payment is used because it is much more secure than paying with a credit card, where some one can copy and use your information, the new forms of online payments offer you the option to buy things remotely without having to worry about your information being compromised or re-used.
==== E-Commerce in a nutshell ====

The world or e-commerce includes online retailer and wholesalers and all other financial transactions that happen online. The e-commerce has several business models the most common are the business to consumer also known as B2C this can be an online retailer selling to the consumer. In addition the business to business or B2B, this is typically a business that offers business solutions for other business. And there is also the consumer to consumer or C2C. ''For detail information see each section for B2B, B2C, C2C.''

=For the Consumers=
[[File:E-Commerce Genossenschaft Logo.png|100px|thumb|An e-commerce website]]
Benefits of e-commerce for customers are convenience (don't need to leave your house or work to shop), easier comparison shopping (there are many sites you can browse looking for one specific thing, or use ''shopping bots'' to do it for you. It would take multiple trips to different stores to check the prices on the same item if there were no e-commerce sites), a higher degree of selection (not limited by what the brick-and-mortar stores have in stock), and the ability to customize products easier (again, not limited by the supply in the brick-and-mortar store, so there are a lot more options to choose from). Another benefit of e-commerce is the ability to shop 24/7. You would not be able to shop at a brick-and-mortar store at one in the morning, but you can buy things off of their websites at that time from the comfort of your home.

The advantages of e-commerce for a consumer are numerous.  Being able to shop from just about anywhere by using a computer or even your phone is very advantageous for anyone.   It could be full-time working mother with children who might only have the early morning or late evening to shop or someone who prefers to stay in their warm home instead of venturing out in a snowstorm to purchase items that they might want or need. Using the internet is also beneficial as you could have more than one website open at one time to check availability and price as opposed to having to go from store to store.

=For the Businesses=
[[File:Laura_Bush_and_Hamid_Karzai_shaking_hands_before_the_press_in_Kabul.jpg‎|100px|Thumb|A Friendly Hand Shake]]

E-commerce business models consist of four different types. First business-to-consumer (B2C). This is when businesses sell goods or services to individual consumers. Second there is business-to-business (B2B). This includes any type of e-commerce transactions that take place between two businesses. The third one is consumer-to-consumer (C2C), or person-to-person. This involves individuals that are selling directly to other individuals. Finally there is business-to-government (B2G). This includes transactions between businesses and local, state, and federal governments. 



The businesses choosing to do business online have a series of advantages when engaging in  e-commerce, too. One of the advantages is a reduced cost of doing the business as some of the expenses that are present with the brick and mortar businesses (such as rent) are being eliminated. The accessibility and convenience of online transactions for the customers is leading to increased customer satisfaction which is another benefit. The business gains access to a worldwide market instead of being limited to a certain geographical area which gives it the advantage of a broader customer base and potential increase in sales.</text>

==A General Look at the United States==
[[Image:No Child Left Behind Act.jpg|thumb|500px|center|Signing ceremony at Hamilton High School in Hamilton, Ohio.]] A great amount of the literature that is available in Colombia is based on the United States milieu. Although Colombian researchers have carried out successful and innovative investigations that in the long run will generate theory in the country, most of the theory that is reviewed in higher education institutions have emerged in a foreign context. The expert on second language learning, Cummins (2000), considers that ''“practice generates theory, which in turn, acts as a catalyst for new directions in practice, 
which then inform theory, and so on “  (p.1).'' If that theory does not emerge from the various contexts that teachers engage in on a daily basis, Colombia will keep on digging up where the answer is not hidden. Sociopolitical issues cause researchers to construct theories that contribute to the improvement of educational practice. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the context in which those theories are generated in order to evaluate their application in Colombia.

On January 8, 2002, President George Bush signed the NCLB Act into law and initiated, as argued by Mallico &amp; Langan as cited in Batt, 2005, ''“the most sweeping change in federal educational policy” (p.1).'' This Act focuses on stronger responsibility for state and local education organizations by holding them accountable for annual progress. This progress, Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), is determined by raising the achievement levels of subgroups of students (major racial and ethnic groups, economically disadvantaged, students with disabilities, Limited English Proficient and special education students) to a state-determined level of proficiency.  Under the NCLB Act every student must meet academic standards in reading and math and a way to determine the schools’ success is test scores. The test results will allow the state to label schools as “satisfactory” or “in need of improvement” but all children must be proficient by 2014 and no child will be left behind. 

A group that finds difficulties to achieve 100% proficiency is the Limited English Proficient subgroup (LEP). LEP students deserve special attention because of their limited proficiency in English resulting in a disadvantage in comparison to students in other subgroups (Batt, 2005). Then, schools with large numbers of LEP students will experience difficulties achieving AYP. However, there are different programs that offer financial support to public schools with high numbers of poor children to help them meet high academic standards. Those schools are called Title I, and the funds are aimed at improving teaching and learning for students. A school with a large number of LEP students can be considered Title I, thus they are evaluated on the percentage of students that score at or above proficiency determined by the state. In addition, states are required to identify, in their student population other languages besides English in order to suitably assess each language from the linguistic aspect. Nonetheless, most schools overlook these requirements and administer the reading and mathematics assessments in the dominant language: English. 

The sanctions schools receive when they do not make AYP vary depending on the number of years it has happened. Sanctions go from developing an improvement plan, offering students the option to transfer to another school, providing tutoring outside the regular school day, replacing some or all of the staff members, implementing a new curriculum, or reopening the school as a charter school ( a public funded school that has been exempted from state or local regulations). These characteristics exemplify the particular benefits of NCLB  for the LEP subgroup which are bringing additional resources as well as attention to the schools that are serving them. The flaw that I can perceive is blame LEP students, as well as the other subgroups, will have to face if the school does not make AYP, generating prejudice and racism among the school community. In the long run, AYP for the LEP subgroup can become a mechanism of exclusion. 
	
When working at a public school in the US, a defiant challenge from the '''NCLB Act''' towards both LEP students and the school itself can be perceived in the atmosphere. The challenges include the instability of the subgroup, the failure of standardized test scores to reflect what students understand, and the lack of proven accommodations that might make the scores more reliable (Batt, 2005). The LEP population does not stay in the same place over the time period allowed by the NCLB  for all students and schools to become proficient. In addition, since the tests are made for native English speakers, LEP students are at a disadvantage due to the lack of cultural knowledge, which is assumed through out the tests. Schools are to offer specific and appropriate accommodations for LEP students, but they are limited to giving extended time to them. How can extended time help students understand the content on the standardized tests when they have weak reading skills? Some states such as Illinois, Virginia, and North Carolina have designed simple language versions of their mathematics and reading assessments aimed at helping schools make AYP, What about the other states? Most other states do not provide other types of assessment for LEP students because of the high cost; therefore, they simply administer the standard reading and math content tests failing to comply with AYP. Policy makers wish for LEP students to become proficient in English and master academic contents. Nevertheless, they are still looking for appropriate ways to incorporate LEP students in the process of accountability.

The ownership of two languages is not as simple as having two wheels or two eyes (Baker, 1996). Being bilingual entails not only the form of the language but also the skills, attitudes and usage given to the specific language. Then, who is bilingual? Bloomfield, cited in Bialystock (2001), insists that ''“a bilingual has full fluency in two languages” (p. 4).'' This general view takes into account neither the pragmatics of the language nor the individual differences of the learners. A bilingual individual is someone who can function in each language according to the given needs (Grosjean, cited in Bialystock, 2001). According to this view, a person that has a basic knowledge of the English language can be compared to a person that has good proficiency, because both of them can develop certain functions of the language. A number of definitions are given by several authors but there has not been a general agreement yet. 

The Bilingual Education Act, which was replaced by the NCLB , tried to address the academic, linguistic, sociocultural, and emotional needs of students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (Ovando, 2003). Under this Act, several bilingual schools were established to serve LEP students, addressing aspects that deal with the acquisition of a second language. After January 8, 2002, the word bilingual was wiped out from the first legislation and policy makers named the new one the 'English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act'. Its purpose is to ensure that LEP students achieve English proficiency, developing high levels of academic success in English.  

Convincing politicians, school communities, parents, and policy makers of the benefits of, not only for LEP students, but also for language majority students, has been a knotty undertaking. School administrators and teachers have to persuade parents of the cognitive, social, and economical benefits that bilingualism would bring to their children in the long run. However, parents still show resistance towards the idea of having their children receive bilingual education. 

Bilingual programs are created in public schools across the United States according to the school administrators’ beliefs, the available funds as well as the staff they depend on. The results of a specific bilingual program depend on resources, allocation class time given to the first and second language, parents’ cooperation, students’ socio-cultural background and the student-teacher environment lived in the school community. 

Since Bilingual education is much more than a pedagogical tool, it has become a societal pain involving complex issues of cultural identity, social class status, and language politics (Ovando, 2002). The insignificant value that is given to Spanish in the United States is determined by the social interaction in the market. The increased number of bilingual programs across the US is due to the degree of awareness that Americans have reached towards this issue. The Hispanics population  is the largest and fastest growing subgroup, and this means economical and political power.  

From the economical point of view, a bilingual person that entered to the country legally can easily earn $40,000 a year. This is affecting the Caucasian unemployment rate. However, Hispanics that are not legally documented get paid the minimum wage. As a result the companies prefer to reduce costs by paying a low salary to illegal immigrants, which in turn causes   discomfort among ethnic groups. 

From a political stance, LEP students are being deprived from their linguistic rights. The so-called English-only movement is carrying not only a powerful linguistic deprivation but also a discrimination mass movement. Florida approved an anti-bilingual ordinance in 1980. This ordinance is exclusive because it does not advocate diversity and difference.  Ambiguity and hidden messages are sent throughout the country with this type of legislation. Moreover, the US Federal Government states there is no official language, yet English is the official one in 26 states. The contrast of views among the states leads us to a hopeless landscape in which minority students are the ones that will suffer from a cognitive, social and cultural aspect. 

What can be done to improve this controversial landscape in which children are in the crossfire? This question leads me to the third issue: how does the US prepare their bilingual teachers for the challenges of the twenty-first century classroom? NCLB Act calls for highly qualified teachers in every core academic classroom by the end of this school year (2005-2006) and to be considered highly qualified, teachers must have a bachelor’s degree, a full state certification and prove that they know each subject they teach. This claim becomes a challenge resulting in a language teacher’s shortage.

Some English language learners have teachers who understand their linguistic needs and provide rich, meaningful lessons that support their language growth (Short, 2005).  The lessons that are planned by these types of teachers promote peer interaction that helps them comprehend the content that is covered in class. However, there are some less favorable learners that have teachers that leave them unsure of the tasks they are expected to do affecting their learning process. 

Native teachers are expected to incorporate English culture in their teaching. Munter and Tinajero (2004) state that ''“the quality of the teacher is the single most outstanding factor leading to increase in pupil 
achievement” (p. 5).'' Teachers need to be well informed about issues that surround cultural awareness and prepared with the methods and pedagogic tools to achieve this so that no child will be left behind.

Mazur and Givens (2004) believe that ''“schools, community, and universities must function as a system rather than as separate entities 
and disconnected goals” (p. 11).'' US teachers need to take the theory to practice by visiting schools and getting familiar with the real situation that the different subgroups are experiencing. It is a matter of partnership to achieve the same goal: acquiring English and getting academic achievement through teacher training. The most recent proposal is to carry out this teaching practice in the context of professional development schools. These schools are an implemented partnership for the academic preparation of interns, as well as the continuous professional development of the school system and institution of higher education. 

In this partnership, the knowledge cannot be placed exclusively on the university students or interns; the school and its staff can give useful information to make connections between theory and the daily classroom practice. These types of practices can meet the different needs of a diverse population of students and achieve students’ success. 

Language teachers, researchers and any individual that are engaged in the educational field should be aware of the context in which the theory is generated. Being familiar with the socio-political issues that take place at the moment theory is brought about helps the government, schools and teachers have a clear goal regarding bilingual education. In the US, this type of education has come down a long and tortured path in which immigrants are hasty to assimilate the language and culture swiftly. The immigration movement is striking different national aspects, such as the acceptance of diverse classrooms, which make policymakers come up with new legislation that is in compliance with their culture, and political framework. Any individual that carries out research on the educational field should evaluate these diverse issues to foresee the application of theory in a different context, in this case, Colombia. 

Colombia is passing through a transitional process in which English is of vital importance to the government. Therefore, the ministry of education, as a means to develop the skills of its citizens at this time of globalization, has created the  Colombia Bilingue project. Its educational purpose, as opposed to the English-only movement in the United States, is seeing the process of language learning as a process of cultural learning. Yet, the project continues searching for solutions that come from abroad overlooking the potential Colombian teachers possess to generate educational theory that can help the students face this new challenge for Colombia.  In the end, answers will be found in the classroom where teachers’ research initiatives generate theory framed by our own socio-economic, political, educational and societal issues.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*'''What is i-dog ?'''

i-dog is a music robot, which was manufactured by Sega Toys in May, 2005. Similar to the name i-dog, this music robot resembles a dog. 
In collaboration with Sony and i Pod (MP3 music player) the i-dog was developed. Unlike real dogs, who eat real dog food, the i-dog feeds off by listening to music. 

*'''How does i-dog work ?'''

Similar to a dogs characteristics, when people touch his tail he will get angry and when people touch his head, he will be happy.

When you own an i dog, try to feed with music 3 hours every day.

*'''Functions of i-dog'''

When you connect to an MP3 Player or a PC, i-dog can be used as a speaker. The i-dog dances to the music by moving his tail and ears. 

As he is growing up, he can mix music and depending on his mood, he can change the music.

Also, depends on what music you are listening, it acts differently. For example, happy songs make his tail moved.

He has some lights on his face which display his mood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chapter One: The Prison Psychologist ==
Lex Luthor is escorted by two prison guards, out of his cell and into the hallway. The other inmates make fun of him as he walks by. His last plan was foiled by Superman and now he is serving the last few months of his prison sentence, which was five years. His lawyers got a reduced sentence in return for Luthor pleading guilty. The guards bring Luthor, who has his hands and feet in shackles, into a holding room, and the Prison Psychologist Dr. Hans Manon is waiting for him. Luther utters a few curses under his breath, and sits down in a chair at a table across from Dr. Manon. The guards wait on the door outside.

Dr. Manon speaks, &quot;So tell me Lex, did you read that book I gave you on critical thinking?&quot; Lex replied &quot;Yes, Doctor, I am trying not to let my emotions think for me. I often let my hate and anger get the better of me.&quot; Dr. Manon says &quot;Good, at least you admit to how you made bad decisions that ended you up in jail.&quot; Lex snarled &quot;It was all Superman's fault anyway, he made me do it!&quot; Dr. Manon smiled and said, &quot;Now now Lex, you know that is not true. Nobody forced you to do anything. Let us work on your obsession with Superman.&quot; Lex frowned, &quot;Superman, if it wasn't for Superman, I'd be doing good things instead of trying to stop him. He is the reason why I make bad decisions.&quot; Dr. Manon grinned, &quot;You are thinking with your emotions again. Lex, listen to me, it is your decisions that are bad, not you. You are a genius with an IQ of 255, and one of the best scientists on the planet. You have within you the power to do good and make good decisions. Who knows what diseases you can cure, what technology you can create, or anything else your brilliant mind can think up. Your last device you used to try to beat Superman, was brilliant, but if only you found a way to use it for good and not destruction.&quot;

Lex smiled, and then frowned, &quot;If Superman never came to this planet, I'd be a hero instead of a villain.&quot; Dr. Manon frowned, &quot;Look Lex, the only one that should be controlling you is you. You cannot change Superman and you cannot change other people, but you can make changes to yourself that allow you to make good decisions.&quot; Lex was surprised, &quot;I see, so I let my hate and anger towards Superman control me and my decisions?&quot; Dr. Manon smiled, &quot;Yes, Superman cannot control you, let us work on your anger and hatred of Superman. Why do you hate Superman?&quot; Lex was shocked that he was asked that question, &quot;Why, why, I am not sure why. Something about him seems phony to me, something about him that I cannot trust. I think he wants to hurt me, like my father hurt me when I was a child.&quot; Dr. Manon replied, &quot;Yes yes, go on. Superman, like your father, is an authority figure. What about Superman reminds you about your father?&quot;

Lex squirmed in his chair, grabbed his arm, and started to cry. &quot;My my father, he always called me a miserable failure. Said I was no good, that I'd amount to nothing. I tried to read science text books, but he would knock them out of my hand and call me stupid, and tell me to become a business man like he is. He said I was too soft, too nice, that I needed to toughen up like him. That he never cried, never felt pain, that he was strong, and always just took whatever he wanted and the ends justified the means. He always claimed he was right and I was wrong. That his way was the way to go, for truth, justice, and the American way.&quot; Dr. Manon wrote down what Lex had said, &quot;Yes, your father, did you hate him? Did he make you angry?&quot; Lex wiped some tears off of his face, &quot;Yes, yes he did make me angry and I did hate him. He would hit me, as well. Destroy anything I built, all of my creations, he just tore them apart.&quot; Dr. Manon wrote down more of Lex's words, &quot;Just like Superman does, doesn't he hit you, and tear apart your creations as well?&quot; Lex appeared angry, &quot;Yes, indeed he does!&quot; Dr. Manon smiled, &quot;Lex, Superman is not your father, you have displaced your father on Superman. Have you ever thought about the harm your creations have caused others?&quot; Lex was shocked, &quot;Why no, I never did think about other people. Oh, oh, God, what have I done? How many people have been killed, wounded, or harmed in any way because of my actions and behaviors?&quot; Then Lex got up and threw up in the nearby trashcan. Dr. Manon patted Lex on the back, &quot;There there, that is just your conscience catching up to you. I think we broke one of your mental blocks today. Throwing up is a natural reaction, you are repulsed by your past behaviors and actions.&quot; Lex wiped his mouth, &quot;Dr. Manon, is there hope for me? Superman was just trying to save innocent people, he is not as bad as my father. I deserve everything I got, every beating, every destroyed invention, how can I change?&quot; Dr. Manon grinned, &quot;One day at a time, Lex, one day at a time. You can learn from your mistakes, and try not to repeat them. Learn to think about other people, and not just yourself and your own personal vendettas against Superman. That is all the time we have for today. Remember, your bad decisions are the real villain, and you can decide from now on to make good decisions and become a hero.&quot; Lex smiled, &quot;Thank you Dr. Manon, for showing me the light and the truth about myself.&quot; The guards walk in and escort Lex back to his cell.

In reading through this, I see that there are a variety of minor (but annoying) errors in
grammar or prose. I'd be willing to address them if the regular authors are willing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Skype is an online telephone. It has all the features you can get with a regular phone, but it's online. In case you might be away Skype also has a built in messaging system to receive voicemail while you are away. Skype connects to computers, landlines or mobiles so you can reach anyone over their telephone line. 

==Costs==
Money is involved with calling people on the phone and skype is no different. Currently they are offering free calling to landlines and mobiles within canada and the US, but that deal only lasts till 2006. Between other skype customers the calling is always free. There is also an option of video calls or group calls. The voicemail does cost money though, but for 1 year it will cost you $20 CDN to send and receive voicemail. Other costs include Inernational calls to landlines and mobiles, forwarding calls to phones, and SMS. Skype accepts payments through PayPal, certain credit cards, Moneybookers, or even withdraw the money for your own bank account.

More individuals, businesses, and home owners are dropping their regular phone company and are starting to use their computer with their microphone and speakers to use Skype. Skype is a free application and service that you are able to download from www.skype.com. Once you have your account setup all you need to do is log into the application like using any instant messenger. If you know the person id you can add it to your list and be able to make that call for free. For other situations you can add credit from your credit card through PayPal. For individuals who have enough vision to work the application they just use the mouse to add contacts, make audio or video calls, text messages, etc. For individuals like myself on the other hand, who has limited vision, I am able to use the keyboard commands incorporated with the scripts from JAWS for Windows a screen reader that reads the text spoken out loud through the computer’s speakers. So if I want to make a call all I need to do is hit Enter on the person’s name and it makes the call for me. To end the call or video chat on the other hand I use the keyboard commands Alt + Down Arrow that I have created from the settings menu. At the moment my monthly subscription for U.S. Canada and portions of Mexico, is $2.99. Yup! You are not imagining what is shown on the screen. So that is why my cell phone has the cheapest plan of 59.00 a month with unlimited texting, and Data plan to be able to use for emergencies and use my Skype account anywhere.

==Extras==
With all the options Skype also offers products for you to purchase. There are headsets and handsets both wired and wireless. For those that wish to show themselves off there is an assortment of webcams with some that include Skype minutes when purchased through Skype's online market.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is article will have information about the two most common scanners. The information will include; cost, and how its used
The four common scanner types are: Flatbed, Sheet-fed, Handheld, and Drum scanners.

;Flatbed Scanners
:Flatbed scanners are some of the most commonly used scanners as it has both home and office functions. The way they scan documents is that a mechanism rolls under the document to obtain the image. For a businesses that have a need for high processing abilities, the flatbed scanner can scan any number of documents with a click of a button. 

[[File:Escaner.jpg|thumb|Flatbed Scanner]]







;Sheet-Fed Scanners
:Sheet-fed scanners cost between $300 and $800. This type of scanner works like a flatbed scanner except that the image is fed through the scanner and moves along the beam to be read rather than the beam moving. This type is not useful for books, but only single sheets.

The aforementioned scanner types are the most common types of scanners used in homes and small offices.





;Integrated Scanners
:Integrated scanners are becoming one of the most modern types of scanners when it comes to obtaining images. ATMs feature this type of built-in scanner for check-processing and approval. 






;Drum Scanners
:These types of scanners are used mainly for capturing a picture and producing at a very high resolution rate. There are only a few companies that make these scanners, considering the high cost of producing a scanner such as this. It is considered a a tremendous upgrade to a regular flatbed scanner.

;Portable Scanners
:Portable scanner are designed to capture text and other data while you are on the go. The scanner is powered by batteries and once you scan the text, the content is stored on the portable scanner. Once you get home, you can transfer the content to a computer. Transferring to your computer is done by using a cable or a wireless connection.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The power supply is a device that provides the computer with the proper needed electricity. It is the device in the tower that the power cord plugs into. This device converts AC (alternating current) to DC (directing current). This is necessary because computers run on direct current. In this power supply, there is a fan to keep it cool because electricity often causes heat. In Brief, the power supply takes AC current from the wall plug, converts it into direct current, and puts it into the motherboard, CD-ROM, and other devices in the tower that require electricity. All computers come with power supplies that are suitable for the amount of energy being used by the stock hardware inside of it. When upgrading hardware, like a video card or installing new fans Etc. you must first check the required wattage that the particular piece of hardware uses. If your power supply does not meet these requirements you will also have to upgrade to a new power supply to ensure your computer does not crash. 
For example, if you have a 400 watt power supply, and you install a new video card that requires 450 watts of energy, you may find your computer crashing when being stressed(watching videos, playing games). If this is the case, do not use the computer until you upgrade your power supply or you remove the piece of hardware that is causing it to crash. This sudden power off of a computer can be detrimental to the internal hardware of the computer. 

There are things to protect a computer from electrical problems; they are: 
-Surge Protectors
-Voltage Regulators
-and UPS

A surge protector protects the computer from being damaged from high volts every once in a while; spikes or surges.

A Voltage Regulator protects the computer from being damaged by low volts. For example, when the power is lower than usual for a second or two.

A UPS (uninterruptible power supply) protects the computer from power failures. For example, when the power cuts out for a little while. The UPS instantly goes into action and runs the computer for at least five minutes. This gives the user a chance to save all the open work if necessary.

All the aforementioned devices connect between the wall outlet and the power supply.

      <comment>Made the is_prime template shorter and more readable, using partial specialization</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Template Meta-programming overview===
Template meta-programming (TMP) refers to uses of the C++ template system to perform computation at compile-time within the code.  It can, for the most part, be considered to be &quot;programming with types&quot; — in that, largely, the &quot;values&quot; that TMP works with are specific C++ types. Using types as the basic objects of calculation allows the full power of the type-inference rules to be used for general-purpose computing.

==== Compile-time programming ====
The preprocessor allows certain calculations to be carried out at compile time, meaning that by the time the code has finished compiling the decision has already been taken, and can be left out of the compiled executable. The following is a very contrived example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#define myvar 17

#if myvar % 2
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Constant is odd&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
#else
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Constant is even&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

This kind of construction does not have much application beyond conditional inclusion of platform-specific code. In particular there's no way to iterate, so it can not be used for general computing. Compile-time programming with templates works in a similar way but is much more powerful, indeed it is actually ''Turing complete''.

Traits classes are a familiar example of a simple form of template meta-programming: given input of a type, they compute as output properties associated with that type (for example, std::iterator_traits&lt;&gt; takes an iterator type as input, and computes properties such as the iterator's difference_type, value_type and so on).

==== The nature of template meta-programming ====
Template meta-programming is much closer to functional programming than ordinary idiomatic C++ is. This is because 'variables' are all immutable, and hence it is necessary to use recursion rather than iteration to process elements of a set. This adds another layer of challenge for C++ programmers learning TMP: as well as learning the mechanics of it, they must learn to think in a different way.

==== Limitations of Template Meta-programming ====
Because template meta-programming evolved from an unintended use of the template system, it is frequently cumbersome. Often it is very hard to make the intent of the code clear to a maintainer, since the natural meaning of the code being used is very different from the purpose to which it is being put. The most effective way to deal with this is through reliance on idiom; if you want to be a productive template meta-programmer you will have to learn to recognize the common idioms.

It also challenges the capabilities of older compilers; generally speaking, compilers from around the year 2000 and later are able to deal with much practical TMP code. Even when the compiler supports it, the compile times can be extremely large and in the case of a compile failure the error messages are frequently impenetrable.

Some coding standards may even forbid template meta-programming, at least outside of third-party libraries like Boost.

==== History of TMP ====
Historically TMP is something of an accident; it was discovered during the process of standardizing the C++ language that its template system happens to be '''Turing-complete''', i.e., capable in principle of computing anything that is computable.  The first concrete demonstration of this was a program written by Erwin Unruh which computed prime numbers ''although it did not actually finish compiling'': the list of prime numbers was part of an error message generated by the compiler on attempting to compile the code.[http://aszt.inf.elte.hu/~gsd/halado_cpp/ch06s04.html#Static-metaprogramming]  TMP has since advanced considerably, and is now a practical tool for library builders in C++, though its complexities mean that it is not generally appropriate for the majority of applications or systems programming contexts.
 
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

template &lt;int p, int i&gt;
class is_prime {
public:
	enum { prim = ( (p % i) &amp;&amp; is_prime&lt;p, i - 1&gt;::prim ) }; 
}; 

template &lt;int p&gt;
class is_prime&lt;p, 1&gt; {
public:
	enum { prim = 1 };
}; 

template &lt;int i&gt;
class Prime_print {      // primary template for loop to print prime numbers
public:
	Prime_print&lt;i - 1&gt; a; 
	enum { prim = is_prime&lt;i, i - 1&gt;::prim };
	void f() {
		a.f();
		if (prim)
		{
			std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;prime number:&quot; &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
		}
	} 
}; 

template&lt;&gt;
class Prime_print&lt;1&gt; {   // full specialization to end the loop
public:
	enum { prim = 0 };
	void f() {}
}; 


#ifndef LAST 
#define LAST 18 
#endif

int main()
{
   Prime_print&lt;LAST&gt; a; 
   a.f(); 
}

&lt;/source&gt;

==== Building blocks ====
===== Values =====
The 'variables' in TMP are not really variables since their values can not be altered, but you can have named values that you use rather like you would variables in ordinary programming. When programming with types, named values are typedefs:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct ValueHolder
{
   typedef int value;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

You can think of this as 'storing' the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; type so that it can be accessed under the &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; name. Integer values are usually stored as members in an enum:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
struct ValueHolder
{
   enum { value = 2 };
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This again stores the value so that it can be accessed under the name &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;. Neither of these examples is any use on its own, but they form the basis of most other TMP, so they are vital patterns to be aware of.

===== Functions =====
A function maps one or more input parameters into an output value. The TMP analogue to this is a template class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;int X, int Y&gt;
struct Adder
{
   enum { result = X + Y };
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This is a function that adds its two parameters and stores the result in the &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; {{C++ Programming/kw|enum}} member. You can call this at compile time with something like &lt;code&gt;Adder&lt;1, 2&gt;::result&lt;/code&gt;, which will be expanded at compile time and act exactly like a literal &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; in your program.

===== Branching =====
A conditional branch can be constructed by writing two alternative specialisations of a template class. The compiler will choose the one that fits the types provided, and a value defined in the instantiated class can then be accessed. For example, consider the following partial specialisation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template&lt;typename X, typename Y&gt;
struct SameType
{
   enum { result = 0 };
};

template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct SameType&lt;T, T&gt;
{
   enum { result = 1 };
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This tells us if the two types it is instantiated with are the same. This might not seem very useful, but it can see through typedefs that might otherwise obscure whether types are the same, and it can be used on template arguments in template code. You can use it like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
if (SameType&lt;SomeThirdPartyType, int&gt;::result)
{
   // ... Use some optimised code that can assume the type is an int
}
else
{
   // ... Use defensive code that doesn't make any assumptions about the type
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code isn't very idiomatic: since the types can be identified at compile-time, the &lt;code&gt;if()&lt;/code&gt; block will always have a trivial condition (it'll always resolve to either &lt;code&gt;if (1) { ... }&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;if (0) { ... }&lt;/code&gt;). However, this does illustrate the kind of thing that can be achieved.

===== Recursion =====
Since you don't have mutable variables available when you're programming with templates, it's impossible to iterate over a sequence of values. Tasks that might be achieved with iteration in standard C++ have to be redefined in terms of recursion, i.e. a function that calls itself. This usually takes the shape of a template class whose output value recursively refers to itself, and one or more specialisations that give fixed values to prevent infinite recursion. You can think of this as a combination of the function and conditional branch ideas described above.

Calculating factorials is naturally done recursively: &lt;math&gt;0! = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n! = n*(n-1)!&lt;/math&gt;.  In TMP, this corresponds to a class template &quot;factorial&quot; whose general form uses the recurrence relation, and a specialization of which terminates the recursion.

First, the general (unspecialized) template says that &lt;code&gt;factorial&amp;lt;n&amp;gt;::value&lt;/code&gt; is given by &lt;tt&gt;n*factorial&amp;lt;n-1&amp;gt;::value&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template &lt;unsigned n&gt;
struct factorial
{
  enum { value = n * factorial&lt;n-1&gt;::value };
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Next, the specialization for zero says that &lt;code&gt;factorial&amp;lt;0&amp;gt;::value&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 1:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
template &lt;&gt;
struct factorial&lt;0&gt;
{
  enum { value = 1 };
};
&lt;/source&gt;

And now some code that &quot;calls&quot; the factorial template at compile-time:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt; 
int main() {
  // Because calculations are done at compile-time, they can be
  // used for things such as array sizes.
  int array[ factorial&lt;7&gt;::value ];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Observe that the &lt;code&gt;factorial&lt;N&gt;::value&lt;/code&gt; member is expressed in terms of the &lt;code&gt;factorial&lt;N&gt;&lt;/code&gt; template, but this can't continue infinitely: each time it is evaluated, it calls itself with a progressively smaller (but non-negative) number. This must eventually hit zero, at which point the specialisation kicks in and evaluation doesn't recurse any further.

====Example: Compile-time &quot;If&quot; ====
The following code defines a meta-function called &quot;if_&quot;; this is a class template that can be used to choose between two types based on a compile-time constant, as demonstrated in '''main''' below:

&lt;source lang=cpp line=&quot;GESHI_NORMAL_LINE_NUMBERS&quot;&gt;
template &lt;bool Condition, typename TrueResult, typename FalseResult&gt;
class if_;

template &lt;typename TrueResult, typename FalseResult&gt;
struct if_&lt;true, TrueResult, FalseResult&gt;
{
  typedef TrueResult result;
};

template &lt;typename TrueResult, typename FalseResult&gt;
struct if_&lt;false, TrueResult, FalseResult&gt;
{
  typedef FalseResult result;
};

int main()
{
  typename if_&lt;true, int, void*&gt;::result number(3);
  typename if_&lt;false, int, void*&gt;::result pointer(&amp;number);

   typedef typename if_&lt;(sizeof(void *) &gt; sizeof(uint32_t)), uint64_t, uint32_t&gt;::result
      integral_ptr_t;
	  
   integral_ptr_t converted_pointer = reinterpret_cast&lt;integral_ptr_t&gt;(pointer);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

On line 18, we evaluate the &lt;code&gt;if_&lt;/code&gt; template with a true value, so the type used is the first of the provided values. Thus the entire expression &lt;code&gt;if_&lt;true, int, void*&gt;::result&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, on line 19 the template code evaluates to &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;. These expressions act exactly the same as if the types had been written as literal values in the source code.

Line 21 is where it starts to get clever: we define a type that depends on the value of a platform-dependent {{C++ Programming/kw|sizeof}} expression. On platforms where pointers are either 32 or 64 bits, this will choose the correct type at compile time without any modification, and without preprocessor macros. Once the type has been chosen, it can then be used like any other type.

{{NOTE|This code is just an illustration of the power of template meta-programming, it is not meant to illustrate good cross-platform practice with pointers.}}

For comparison, this problem is best attacked in C90 as follows
&lt;source lang=c line=&quot;GESHI_NORMAL_LINE_NUMBERS&quot;&gt;
# include &lt;stddef.h&gt;
typedef size_t integral_ptr_t;
typedef int the_correct_size_was_chosen [sizeof (integral_ptr_t) &gt;= sizeof (void *)? 1: -1];
&lt;/source&gt;

As it happens, the library-defined type &lt;code&gt;size_t&lt;/code&gt; should be the correct choice for this particular problem on any platform.
To ensure this, line 3 is used as a compile time check to see if the selected type is actually large enough; if not, the array type &lt;code&gt;the_correct_size_was_chosen&lt;/code&gt; will be defined with a negative length, causing a compile-time error.  In C99, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; may define the types &lt;code&gt;intptr_h&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;uintptr_h&lt;/code&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two types of storage, primary and secondary storage. Primary storage deals with temporary storage and is usually called &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;main memory&quot;. Secondary storage deals with permanent storage and is usually called &quot;storage&quot;. Most memory is referred to storing media, documents...etc on chips, whereas storage stores it on disks or tapes. Memory (primary storage) is stored on RAM chips or Random Access Memory chips. Whenever you open a file from the secondary storage it is opened on the RAM and allows you to make amendments to it. When you save the file it is then moved back to the secondary storage and saved on the hard drive. Basically you can think of the secondary storage as the refrigerator and the primary storage or RAM as the counter or stove in which you cook. There are different types of RAM some which include DRAM, SDRAM, SRAM and DDR - SDRAM. DRAM is abbreviated for &quot;dynamic ram&quot; and is constantly refreshed by the PC to keep its contents. SDRAM is abbreviated for &quot;synchronous dynamic ram&quot; and is synchronized by the system clock. This allows it to be faster than DRAM and the speed is measured in megahertz. SRAM is abbreviated for &quot;static ram&quot; is faster than DRAM and keeps its contents without having to be refreshed by the PC. DDR - SDRAM is abbreviated for &quot;double-data rate synchronous dynamic ram&quot;. It is the most current RAM, it is used commonly in PC and Apple's and is also measured in megahertz.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to specify the path to a file==
I need to know how to use open statement in VB to open a file with variable name.
I could do it using:


Open CStr(variable) For Output As #1

but I can not specify the path ...........it shows error and I can not specify the extension .txt ?

please help me

thanks

:The variable simply needs to hold a path to the file.  Usually ''variable'' would be a ''string'' so there is no need to use ''CStr''.  The path can be an absolute path such as:

  variable = &quot;d:\users\me\my file.txt&quot;

or a file in the current directory (use ''CurDir'' to find out what that is):

  variable = &quot;my file.txt&quot;

or a path relative to the current directory like this:

  variable = &quot;..\you\your file.txt&quot;

or like this:

  variable = &quot;mysub\myother file.txt&quot;

For the more adventurous it can also include a reference to a shared file on a server that doesn't use a drive letter:

  variable = &quot;\\someserver\someshare\somefile.txt&quot;

I have added this to the page as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Speakers have evolved since they were added into computers. I don't even think the first computer had a sound system. Eventually a small speaker was installed for the annoying beeps. Then the speaker spoke to tell you when something wasn't connected properly. With the invention of the sound card we were given speakers as an output device. When I got my speakers I thought it was going to be difficult to install them, but I proved myself wrong, it's practically &quot;sound&quot; proof. For most speakers you just connect the cords into the output jacks of your sound card. If you went for the big set (like I did) then you will find yourself with about 5 speakers and a subwoofer. I'll all connecting cords into the color coordinated output jacks in the subwoofer. Then the one big subwoofer connecting cord will split into 3 cords, which go into the colour coordinated jacks of your sound card. If you try this and it still doesn't work try plugging in the subwoofer for some power. Now your ready to sit in front of your PC for hours on end. Enjoy!


====='''&lt;u&gt;Types of Speakers&lt;/u&gt;'''=====


'''Speakers Built Into Computer Monitor and Laptop'''[[File:Benq laptop.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Laptop with speakers built in.]]

Some computer speakers come already built into a monitor and all laptops come with speakers built directly into the device. Nowadays nearly all towers can be hooked up to a modern flat screen tv and all the tvs come with speakers built in so it is unnecessary to purchase separate speakers unless an upgrade in sound quality is desired. Most of the speakers that come built in to tv screens and laptops are usually not very big or powerful so many people that use their computers to listen to music will upgrade their speakers by purchasing them separately and hooking them up directly to their tower or laptop.


'''Stand Alone Computer Speakers'''[[File:Logitech-usb-speakers.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Logitech computer speakers with a USB connection.]]

Computer Speakers are the most common type of audio output device. Computer speakers are connected to a computer to provide audio output for things such as computer games, music, TV shows, YouTube videos and more. Some speakers available come in a simple pair, while others come in a entire system with additional speakers and a subwoofer for better sound.







'''Headphones'''

Headphones can also be used as audio output in place of computer speakers. The advantage of using headphones as speakers for your computer or laptop is so the audio output does not disturb others. This allows a person to listen to music and videos in publics places such as Starbucks, or quite places such as the library.

Unverifiable, non-textbook material. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

::People have received degrees in Magick from institutions such as Berkeley (not to say it was well received):
:::&quot;He was going to be a psychology major, but through Berkeley's individual group-study program he fashioned his own course of studies. In 1970 he graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in magic, the only person to do so from a Western educational institution. He is the last to do so too, because the university administrators were so embarrassed over the publicity about the degree in magic, witchcraft and sorcery that they banned it from the individual group-study program.&quot;

::So... ? --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 10:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
::: The existence of one self-led course on a subject now banned from the same university hardly justifies this book. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:10, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
* I'll read through the text later this week, but I just want to mention that the subject of Magick itself is not inherently unverifiable, non-textbook, original research, or whatever. It can be studied from a reserved sociological and anthropological angle. Consider scanning over some of Chapter 4 of ''Outline of a General Theory of Magic'' by the French sociologists [[w:Marcel Mauss]] and [[w:Henri Hubert]] located [http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/10/30/332551/gen.pdf here]. What text I saw, however, in the wikibook, doesn't look like that pdf. I'll check later tho. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
*: I definitely agree that there could be a textbook about magick in the historical, sociological or anthropological sense. But this is one that purports to be a textbook on the practice of Magick and is therefore not suitable for wikibooks. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:21, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

* I do have a tendency to jump in rather quickly so I've left this one a while!  However '''Delete''' is my vote.  The content is questionable however my main reason is that I believe I would have been justified in placing a &quot;qr-em&quot; tag on this.  It is essentially a collection of redlinks with a small amount of content and has stayed that way for over two weeks now. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:33, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

* Having considered several factors, I have take it upon myself to edit the book a bit. I will try to add to it more, and also properly format it for Wikibooks. Please let me know how the book could be changed further to meet the specifications of a Wikibook. I suppose, however, if the book simply cannot meet the requirements of a Wikibook then it should be deleted, but I think that would be unfortunate. Hopefully, something can be worked out so the book can meet community standards. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 11:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
*: As with a wikipedia article, each fact presented in a wikibook must be cited from verifiable, reliable sources. I say this book '''could''' be about the history of magic beliefs, as documented in 'magic manuals' or whatever people use, and it could be on scientific investigation of magic beliefs, if any such investigations exist. I do not belive that it could ''ever'' be a how-to manual on magic while still conforming with verifiability. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:56, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
*:: Wikibooks policy references NPOV, but doesn't seem to reference verifiability.  Does Magick violate NPOV? --[[User:David Olsson|David Olsson]] 07:59, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
*::: Possibly, as it asserts that magic produces any results. I don't think you can write a textbook on &quot;how to do magic&quot; that is actually neutral as the very premise is biased. Every page would need something notice like &quot;magick is generally accepted to be fake/false/fraudulent.&quot; [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:10, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' To be acceptable for Wikibooks' standards this book really has to be transformed into a 'History of Magic'. It could also contain examples of the different practices associated with magic (whether historical or contemporary), but as it stands, this book is more of a how-to guide to something that is generally accepted as rubbish; and therefore does not meet Wikibook standards. I'd be prepared to let [[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] have some time to restructure the book, deleting or rewording certain pages. [[User:Tommciver|Tommciver]] 09:45, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

:*'''Comment''' - I've had discussions with [[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] along those lines myself (putting this &quot;on hold&quot; for a while as the the one at the top of the page at present.  However as I understand it he feels he has done what he can.  I am left with the feeling there could be a valid book here but not perhaps as it stands --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:51, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

* As the very topic itself goes deeply against some of my personal religious beliefs, I had to dig deep to come up with a fair vote.  Honestly, it would be interesting to see something like this developed (as mentioned above) into a History of Magick......that would be valuable within a forum like this.  However, considering how long it's had (nearly) nothing done to it (development-wise), I'd have to vote '''Delete'''. [[User:Buddpaul|Buddpaul]] 01:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

* I hate to beat a dead horse, but this statement in the lead-in: &quot;Magick may be a science...&quot;  No it can't be a science......it's metaphysical.......Protestantism is no more a science than a boiled egg is a piece of computer hardware.....and Magick is metaphysical.  Statements like that help me to stick by my '''Delete''' vote......[I'm done!]. [[User:Buddpaul|Buddpaul]] 01:49, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Yes people claim that this exists, but that does not make it verifiable, textbook material. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:47, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

::: While remote viewing is not &quot;verifiable&quot; in the sense that so far as we know you could not prove that the phenomenon exists to someone who has not experienced it, many books exists on subjects saying that: here is what people claim is real, here is how they claim to do it, and if you want to learn how to do it too, here is what the people who claim to have experienced this phenomenon have said is how they have reached the point that they are at. In the same way, I presume there are book on theology here, and I know that you can study theology over at Wikiversity. So what is theology besides a discourse and study of the history and theory of a non-verifiable phenomenon that people have claimed to have experienced?

:::It seems that a book could fit in here that says: here is what remote view supposedly is, here is the historical background of the topic, and here is how people claim to do it. Let me also say, that I have not thoroughly looked through the remote viewing book, and I am not intimately aquainted with Wikibooks' policies regarding the subject. I do know that there are college classes on such things as &quot;paranormal psychology&quot; which explores subjects such as remote view, telepathy, relgious experience etc. This one class that I know of personally was pretty much a debunking class though... --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 06:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

: '''Keep'''.  No idea what it's about and the author really needs to make this part clear.  But I don't think it should be deleted at this stage.  [[User:Xania|Xania]] 22:43, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Huh?! This is supposedly a textbook on how to be a psychic. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:::I personally am a strong skeptic of material like this, but that doesnt change the fact that there are &quot;professional&quot; psychics, and schools for learning that kind of nonsense. I may not agree with it, but &quot;respected institutions&quot; (using a broad definition of &quot;respected&quot;) could use a book like this. I would certainly like to include a note saying that much of this material is difficult and un-scientific. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:50, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: As with [[Magick]], this could also be seen to violate NPOV based upon the premise that the very premise of the book is NPOV -- that one can achive &quot;remote viewing&quot; at all. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:41, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

::PS. I seem to remember that this book has been nominated for VfD before. I dont have time to go digging through the archives tonight, does anybody know what became of that discussion? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:52, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

::: The only thing I could find was [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Remote Viewing/Pr02|this VfD]] on [[Remote_Viewing/Pr02]] (deleted and page protected against recreation). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

: '''Keep''' --- I am skeptical of this kind of stuff like Whiteknight. Nonetheless, it is popular enough that I expect that there are books and whatnot on this kind of stuff that makes it &quot;verifiable&quot;. Most arguments I have against this book (in my mind) would go against [[Lucid Dreaming]]. I can't really think of a good reason to delete this other than &quot;I don't beleive in it&quot;. And deleting something on those grounds alone is dangerous IMO. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 05:04, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:: The reason I nominated this book for deletion (and this may well be applicable for lucid dreaming) is that it is inherently '''unverifiable''' and therefore not appropriate. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:09, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

: '''Comment'''. Though the effects are unverifiable, I think the topic can be dealt with properly because the practice of remote viewing (which is the topic of the wikibook) is verifiable. The main problem, I believe, is that of NPOV &amp;mdash; not an inherent one but because of how it is currently implemented.
: The book makes no reservation for a critical approach on the subject and badly needs '''review and rewrite'''. If that doesn't happen, it does not conform to policy and should be '''deleted'''. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 16:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:'''Delete''' unless '''rewrite'''. I agree with [[User:Swift|Swift]]. It should be handled as a &quot;history of&quot; the practice of remote viewing, not a &quot;how to&quot; that is unverifiable. This is independent research. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 18:05, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:'''Comment'''. Remote viewing may not be a scientific study, but that doesnt mean that it's a new topic, that people haven't studied it in some fashion. Since there is likely material written about this subject (as dubious as that material may be), it satisfies our inclusion criteria. Remember the old adage, ''verifiability does not imply truth''. So long as this book references it's sources (regardless of the quality of those sources), i am inclined to say it should stay. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:12, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
:: Yes, the topic of 'remote viewing' is acceptable for wikibooks, but this book does not reference any sources and approaches the subject from the standpoint that remote viewing is achievable at all and that this book can teach it to you. In its current form it is blatantly POV, unverifiable, and therefore unacceptable. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:16, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
:::This raises an interesting point, then. If topics such as 'remote viewing' are acceptable for WikiBooks, then what sources should be used? Ones that are considered &quot;respectable&quot; by the Remote Viewing community? How would such a distinction be drawn? Who are the &quot;authorities&quot; on Remote Viewing? What respected, legitimate universities are currently offering classes on Remote Viewing? [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 21:42, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
:::: I've no clue; my point was just that I wasn't dismissing the topic as unacceptable for discussion, but that it's unacceptable to discuss it in a how-to manner. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
::::: OK, sorry Kellen. I guess I should've directed my reply to Whiteknight. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 04:12, 13 January 2007 (UTC)
:::: Remember, it is the job of wikibooks to write textbooks, not to read and verify external works. The fact that this module doesnt reference any sources shouldn't make it a candidate for deletion. There are plenty of wikibooks here that don't reference any sources, or dont reference their sources properly. There are also a number of books here that discuss things that aren't &quot;possible&quot; (many engineering books, for instance, discuss &quot;ideal systems&quot; that can't possibly exist) and there are even some books around here that contain information that isn't strictly verifiable (physics books that discuss the more esoteric points of relativity, quantum mechanics, or string theory, for instance). As a last point, I think that this module has come up for VfD before, and it should not be deleted without first reading that first discussion (if it does in fact exist), and examining the rationale behind the last decision to keep it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:44, 12 January 2007 (UTC) 
::::*Please see Swift's comments above regarding [[Remote_Viewing/Pr02]] which was the only page considered for deletion before --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:49, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' I've been watching this one throughout.  While some strong views have been expressed in the end I do not see this as a &quot;textbook&quot; in a Wikibooks sense as it stands.  Further - unless there are some valid &amp; rational arguments offered I plan to close this as '''delete''' in the next couple of days --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:41, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

This book was originally added six months ago. It has not had any significant edits since the day it was created. It was apparently intended to be a Wikijunior book as the author left links to it on Wikijunior Pages. It does not contain any content of reasonable value and did not go through the Wikijunior New Title process. I believe it should be deleted. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 20:51, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - As it stands it's not a book.  And it's a bit of a dodgy topic for kids really.  I have a book on Wikijunior which didn't go through the Wikijunior New Title process so I'm voting for deletion on content and usefulness merits only. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 20:56, 29 November 2006 (UTC)
:: '''Coment''' - I do not think skipping the new book process in itself is a good argument for deletion, but if this title had been listed there and had the associated outline and user comments, that would have been something in its favor, IMO. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 22:29, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

* '''Weak Delete''' - On the grounds that some books that are mere stubs perhaps ought to be deleted eventually.  This is as close to being a pure stub of a Wikibook as you can get.  Wikibooks is litterally filled with raw stubs like this, and some cleanup has occured to remove stuff like this in the past.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:58, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
: &lt;s&gt;'''Keep and move to Wikijunior'''&lt;/s&gt; - [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy#What_to_keep.2C_what_to_delete|Policy dictates]] that we keep this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 13:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
:: '''Delete'''. No meaningful content. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:39, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
: '''Comment''' I understand the value of deleting here since this stub has no structure and has been stagnant for six months. However, I think we need to focus on why the project would benefit by not having this book. The way I see it, stubby books are more likely to draw contributors than empty spaces on the bookshelves. There are a lot of stubs going up for deletion these days and good riddance to some of them. Policy, however, does not allow stubs with potential. If there is a strong feeling that these should be deleted, it is time to propose a change to the policy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 13:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
:: '''Comment''' and fair comment Swift, however I don't think this is the best example you could use --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:19, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
::: I don't quite understand you. I'm not making an example. I'm pointing to policy. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:30, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
:: '''Comment''' I guess that depends what the definition of &quot;definition&quot; is. In my opinion, a definition for a Wikijunior book should include a name, a target age, a scope, a selection of possible article titles, and a list of typical article questions. Wikijunior should not become a free for all with any non-fiction book aimed at children allowed. As it stands our top page has to serve as both a landing page for contributors and our intended audience, kids. It would be damaging to the project if many stubs like this were created, abandoned, and allowed to sit abandoned. There is nothing in this 'book' that could be kept to be made into a Wikijunior book. Not even the title. Perhaps the idea of having a health book for children could be kept, but such a book would be a major undertaking and would be far too broad to fit within the current &quot;42 page&quot; definition of what a Wikijunior book should be. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 19:48, 2 December 2006 (UTC)
::: &quot;''I guess that depends what the definition of &quot;definition&quot; is.''&quot; No. It depends on what the definition of &quot;policy&quot; is. According to [[WB:PAG#Definition of terms]]:
:::: ''A policy is a set of rules that must be followed.''
::: For the definition of &quot;must&quot; see the above link.
::: &quot;''In my opinion, a definition for a Wikijunior book should include''&quot;. Then propose a policy for Wikijunior, tag it as {{tl|proposed}} and get it accepted by the Wikibooks community. Until then you can't really break policy according to your personal opinion. I understand your arguments and have no real attachment to the book, but until there is a demonstrated community consensus on this (I don't see VfD sufficient) policy must dictate.
::: &quot;''Perhaps the idea of having a health book for children could be kept''&quot;. OK, then how about moving it to [[Wikijunior Medicine for Kids]], not linked from anywhere in particular, but categorized somehow?
::: Alternatively, categorize, rather than {{tl|vfd}} these WJ books and create a seperate WJ policy, get it accepted and then {{tl|delete}} the tagged guys en-masse. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:30, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
:::: '''Comment''' I'll not be spending any of my time working on this book. I do not currently have the energy or enthusiasm to write and shepherd any kind of Wikijunior policy. I will stay out of VfD's in the future. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 15:57, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
::::'''Strong Delete'''. I am going to disagree with you Swift, I don't think that the policy you are pointing to indicates we should keep this one at all. The deletion policy says &quot;However, delete stubs that don't even have a decent definition.&quot;, which seems to describe this page exactly. A textbook &quot;definition&quot; is more then simply a sentence with a stated goal. Also, on the deletion policy, this &quot;book&quot; doesnt even qualify as &quot;meaningful content&quot;. It's a page with a sentence and an external link (the link points to de.wikibooks, but for the purposes of this discussion I am going to consider that &quot;External&quot;). That the word &quot;definition&quot; is not properly defined on the policy page does not mean that it can be ignored as a criteria for keeping a book. In the face of such vagaries, we must rely on our own personal interpretations of the policy, like [[User:Xixtas]] did above. Many policies are purposefully written with such vagaries, to allow wikibookians to analyze policy matters on a case-by-case basis. We are not robots, and there is (and must be) a certain amount of leighway for us when making decisions about this kind of stuff. I posit that this book '''does not have an acceptable definition''', and it is not meaningful content, and that it should, therefore, be deleted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
::::: I think the definition is fine, but I'll agree with the no meaningful content point. I've changed my vote. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:39, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

&quot;Content required&quot; means that essentially this is an advert and an advert for &quot;consultancy&quot; is not required by Wikibooks (which requires content for a reader rather than links).  There is nothing directly applicable to the autistic spectrum on the website (which is what the page is about).  I will removed the link.  If you do not agree please take it up on the talk page rather than replacing it.

== Post on talk page of 'Survival Guide for People with Autism' regarding copyright ==

Hi,

I've posted a [[Talk:Survival_Guide_for_People_with_Autism#Copyright_uncertainty_of_the_book_-_.2895.25_ok._5.25_uncertain.29|topic about copyright rights]] on the talk page of the book 'Survival Guide for People with Autism'. There I explain about my uncertainty of if the book is fully free.(ie. we/you know that the authors have agreed/'given their consent' to the licenses used on wikibooks. That wikibooks is not a website that hosts all kinds of books but specifically books that are considered &quot;free&quot; in a libre sense. Thank you for your time.

      <comment>/* REPLACE and ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE replacements */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There is no DATETIME type in PostgreSQL. I have an impression MySQL and PostgreSQL types are replaced in the table.

Cf. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MySQL/Language#Dates] for a difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP in MySQL.

There should be some info that you can retrieve data like &quot;SHOW table&quot; (MYSQL) in PostgreSQL too by using SQL statements or programming language interfaces, not just by tools. 

Look for pg system tables and/or INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
*information_schema is in MySQL 5 as well. I don't know if they're exactly the same in both but it might be worth mentioning.

Why not use MD5 instead of password for authentication?

== Helper tool? ==

Isn't it possible to create one program which one could give the mysql dump and it converts it to a pg-insertable dump?
Or is there already one I have greatly missed? (If so, please link to it ;)
AFAIS that would be a bit of work (and maybe a little headache too), but no rocket-science. Am I wrong, or hasn't the effort simply been made yet?

I suggest mentioning this in the intro section (to clarify why one needs this book at all).

== REPLACE and ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE replacements ==

Personally I feel that the provided alternative isn't the most appropriate one. It isn't very clear how to use it as is and there is a risk of a &quot;duplicate key violation&quot; when multiple transactions try to do the same.
PostgreSQL themselves already [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/plpgsql-control-structures.html#PLPGSQL-UPSERT-EXAMPLE provide a pretty good alternative] and with a slight modification it can be made clear how people can apply it:

 CREATE FUNCTION insertOrUpdate(key INT, data TEXT, [...]) RETURNS VOID AS
 $$
 BEGIN
 	LOOP
 		-- first try to update the key
 		UPDATE ''table'' SET ''datacolumn'' = data WHERE ''keycolumn'' = key;
 		IF found THEN
 			RETURN;
 		END IF;
 		-- not there, so try to insert the key
 		-- if someone else inserts the same key concurrently,
 		-- we could get a unique-key failure
 		BEGIN
 			INSERT INTO ''table''(''keycolumn'', ''datacolumn'') VALUES (key, data);
 			RETURN;
 		EXCEPTION WHEN unique_violation THEN
 			-- do nothing, and loop to try the UPDATE again
 		END;
 	END LOOP;
 END;
 $$
 LANGUAGE plpgsql;

Yet [http://www.pointwriter.com/blog/index.php?/archives/6-REPLACE-in-PostgreSQL.html another alternative] would be:
 CREATE RULE insertOrUpdate AS
 	ON INSERT TO ''table''
 	WHERE
 		EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM ''table'' WHERE ''keycolumn'' = NEW.key)
 	DO INSTEAD
 		(UPDATE ''table'' SET ''datacolumn'' = NEW.data WHERE ''keycolumn'' = NEW.key);

These alternatives are technically only an alternative for ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, just like the current alternative, not REPLACE.
I found the changes a  bit too drastic to just apply so I'd like to hear your opinions first.

At [[WB:WIW|Wikibooks]] editors are encouraged to [[WB:BOLD|be bold]] in their editing practices. When disagreements arise writing and editorial [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decisions are made collaboratively]]. This policy explains the limitations that apply in what you can control when doing work at Wikibooks. These limitations may not apply to works forked outside of Wikibooks and should not be confused for the [[Foundation:Terms of Use|licensing terms of use]].

== Ownership ==
By contributing, you agree not to assert authority or control over books, and to allow anyone to edit, modify, delete, and fork books at Wikibooks. You may not prevent others from editing or modifying content. This is true regardless of who started the page or who has contributed &quot;the most&quot; to the book. If you wish to prevent others from editing or modifying content, you may fork pages or books outside of Wikibooks where you can assert whatever editorial control over the copy you use within the [[Foundation:Terms of Use|licensing terms of use]].

Behavior that other contributors view as ownership may not mean an explicit claim to owning the book.  More frequently the term is used to describe an unwillingness to discuss or compromise.  One clear indicator of a problem is when one contributor repeatedly reverts or otherwise removes the work of other contributors.  Because of the hard work involved in creating a book, strong opinions about the books content are natural, but if you find yourself doing this then it is time to stop and discuss.  A willingness to discussion and compromise keeps everyone on equal terms in [[Wikibooks:Decision making|deciding]] what goes into books.

Wikibooks [[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] can protect pages from being edited as a deterrent to vandalism and edit warring. Page protection in this sense should not be used to exercise control over the contents of a page and any editorial control can only be enforced by community decisions, policies or guidelines.

Do not contribute your content to Wikibooks if you do not want other people using your contents in whatever way they want without your express permission.

Wikibooks is a community of people not just a webserver filled with e-books. As such, it is important that people treat each other in kind and constructive ways. 

== Do Unto Others ==

Wikibookians are encouraged to [[Wikibooks:Be civil|be civil towards one another]], if they absolutely cannot be completely nice. Give others the benefit of the doubt when they do something you disagree with. Don't insult people, use bad language, or otherwise be unpleasant. Also, when possible, help out the new users. If every new user gets off to the right foot, wikibooks will be a better place.

# [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]]
# [[Wikibooks:Please do not bite the newcomers]]

== Accept What You Should Not Change ==

Wikibooks is a collaborative project, and as such, there are many different people contributing to it. Anything that you contribute could be fixed, edited, revised, altered, or even deleted completely (although the latter shouldn't happen unless you've made a big mistake). This is normal, and is even encouraged. Unfortunately, this also means that you can't control projects you work on, and that you can't prevent other people from contributing to them. If you see people doing things differently from you, talk to them, work together, and find a good middle ground.

Anybody may be able to edit wikibooks, but that doesn't mean that all edits and all contributions are allowed to stay here. Wikibooks has some important rules to follow concerning what types of content can be added to our project. If you add content that isn't allowed, the content could be deleted, and (in extreme cases) you could be blocked from wikibooks all together.

== What Can't be Contributed ==

Wikibooks is a place for writing collaborative textbooks. Textbooks typically are used to convey information that is already known by the experts to the new students in the subject. For that reason, Wikibooks is not the correct place to write about new information. Anything that is new, original, or novel does not belong on wikibooks.

Textbooks also are informational works, not propaganda. For that reason, all material on wikibooks must maintain strict neutrality. You can not write  to convince other people about your political ideologies, your religious beliefs, or any other biased information.

Even though you can add content to wikibooks at will, you should only use wikibooks for the creation of textbooks. Wikibooks shouldn't be used as a discussion forum, a blog, a bulletin board for outside projects, or a personal webhost for information that doesnt relate to our goals of writing textbooks. That information might all have some value, but it doesnt belong here.

# [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]]

== What Can be Contributed ==

Textbooks require text, certainly, but also images and diagrams and tables. All text contributed to Wikibooks must be licensed under the [[GFDL]], but images and other media can be licensed under a number of other free licenses, such as the Creative Commons licenses, the BSD license, or even can be released into the public domain. 

Images can be uploaded to the wikibooks server, or they can be uploaded to [[commons:Main page|Wikimedia Commons]]. Commons is a webserver that stores images for use on many projects, wikibooks, wikipedia, and wikiversity all share images with Commons. If you have an image you would like to upload, consider uploading it at wikimedia commons, so everybody can share it.

Wikibooks is a collaborative community, where people work together to write open-content textbooks. However, because there is no firm organizational or editorial structure at wikibooks, there are bound to be questions about who gets to edit what when, and who gets the final say, and who gets to make changes. 

== Who Gets the Final Say? ==

No one person has the authority to make decisions, and nobody gets the &quot;final say&quot; on any matter. Wikibooks, and the individual book subprojects on wikibooks are not monarchies, and there is no &quot;king of wikibooks&quot;. All decisions should be made by concensus from the community at large. Notice that &quot;concensus&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;majority rule&quot;. Wikibooks is also not a democracy, and majority voting is not an appropriate way to solve disputes. If you have a disagreement with other editors, work it out, discuss it, and compromise. Compromise is the most important skill you can have here on wikibooks.

See Also:
# [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]

== How Are Changes Made? ==

Concensus is a slow process for making new changes, especially when those changes are small, or if there isn't really going to be any opposition anyway. The general motto here at wikibooks is [[Wikibooks:Be bold|&quot;Be Bold!&quot;]]. If you see a change that needs to be made, make it. If you see something that needs to be improved, improve it! If, however, your changes are met with opposition, you must then rely on concensus, discussion, and compromise to find the best solutions to the problem.

See Also:
# [[Wikibooks:Be bold]]
# [[Wikibooks:Editing guideline]]

== Who Is In Charge? ==

You are! It is up to you to make changes where you feel they are necessary. It is up to you to contribute content that you are able. Nobody is going to tell you what to do, or when to do it. Wikibooks does have certain community members who are active on a wide scale, and who have been informally dubbed &quot;staff&quot;. Wikibooks staff are available to you to ask questions, and to provide help. To get in touch with a staff member, ask a question on the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]]. If you would like to become a staff member, there is no process involved, just help out and answer other people's questions too!

== How are Books Made? ==

You make them! If you want to contribute content, please feel free to do so. However, if you would like to start an entirely new book, that's fine too. Books take alot of work, and a lot of planning so make sure that you don't rush into it and get in over your head. In a worst-case scenario, your new book could become so bad and unusable, that it could get deleted! A new book should be properly named, should be properly organized, and should follow all the applicable conventions and style guidelines. Once you create a new book, leave a note about it on the [[WB:SLN|New Books Staff Lounge]], a page where new users can announce their new projects (or just say hello).

Wikibooks is a large place, and in addition to the contribution of textbook content, there is alot of work done by volunteers to keep this place clean, organized, and running smoothly. 

== Wikibooks Staff ==

There are some contributors who, in addition to contributing textbook content, also work to make wikibooks a better place. These people are informally dubbed &quot;staff&quot;. Wikibooks staff might help answer questions, or they may come to help fix your formatting and grammar, or they may even participate in discussions that affect the project as a whole. Some staff members help to fight vandalism, some work to organize books, some write policy and guidelines, some write in the [[Help:Contents|help book]], and some do a little of everything!

== How do I Become Staff? ==

You get to decide your own level of involvment in the wikibooks project. If you want to be a staff member, all you need to do is start acting like a staff member. See a new user who needs help? Help! See vandalism? Clean it! See a discussion? Join in and express your opinions. There are all sorts of things that you can do right now to help out the wikibooks project.

== What are &quot;Administrators&quot;? ==

Administrators are staff members who have some additional tools. These additional tools, such as the power to delete pages, and the power to block malicious vandals, are necessary for the operation of wikibooks, but require a certain amount of trust in order to get them. Administrators are nominated and voted on at [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]]. Remember, Administrators have large responsibilities, and voting for a new administrator should never be a popularity contest.

Administrators, while well-trusted, do not have any additional authority here on Wikibooks. The oldest, most trusted administrator has just as much say in a discussion as the newest of new users.

# [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]
# [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]]

== How Do We Get Rid of Garbage? ==

Some pages just don't belong here on wikibooks, and following a discussion, they can be deleted. Pages that might need to be deleted are nominated on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]. Following that discussion, if the community agrees, an administrator will delete the page. Participating in these discussions, known as &quot;VfD Discussions&quot; is a great and easy way to get involved in the wikibooks community, and to learn more about wikibooks policy.

See Also:
# [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]]
# [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]

== How Do We Fight Vandalism? ==

Only an administrator can block vandals from editing but any user, even you, can help to fix the damage caused by these vandals. If you see vandalism, fix it, and post an alert on [[Wikibooks:Vandalism in progress]]. When an admin sees your note, he will block the vandal, and help with the cleanup effort.

The most important thing to know about strings in Common Lisp is probably that they are arrays and thus also sequences. This implies that all concepts that are applicable to arrays and sequences also apply to strings. If you can't find a particular string function, make sure you've also searched for the more general array or sequence functions. We'll only cover a fraction of what can be done with and to strings here.

== Accessing Substrings ==

As a string is a sequence, you can access substrings with the SUBSEQ function. The index into the string is, as always, zero-based. The third, optional, argument is the index of the first character which is not a part of the substring, it is not the length of the substring.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;Groucho Marx&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(subseq *my-string* 8)
⇒ &quot;Marx&quot;
(subseq *my-string* 0 7)
⇒ &quot;Groucho&quot;
(subseq *my-string* 1 5)
⇒ &quot;rouc&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also manipulate the substring if you use SUBSEQ together with SETF.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;Harpo Marx&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(subseq *my-string* 0 5)
⇒ &quot;Harpo&quot;
(setf (subseq *my-string* 0 5) &quot;Chico&quot;)
⇒ &quot;Chico&quot;
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;Chico Marx&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

But note that the string isn't &quot;stretchable&quot;. To cite from the HyperSpec: &quot;If the subsequence and the new sequence are not of equal length, the shorter length determines the number of elements that are replaced.&quot; For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;Karl Marx&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(subseq *my-string* 0 4)
⇒ &quot;Karl&quot;
(setf (subseq *my-string* 0 4) &quot;Harpo&quot;)
⇒ &quot;Harpo&quot;
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;Harp Marx&quot;
(subseq *my-string* 4)
⇒ &quot; Marx&quot;
(setf (subseq *my-string* 4) &quot;o Marx&quot;)
⇒ &quot;o Marx&quot;
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;Harpo Mar&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Accessing Individual Characters ==

You can use the function CHAR to access individual characters of a string. CHAR can also be used in conjunction with SETF.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;Groucho Marx&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(char *my-string* 11)
⇒ #\x
(char *my-string* 7)
⇒ #\Space
(char *my-string* 6)
⇒ #\o
(setf (char *my-string* 6) #\y)
⇒ #\y
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;Grouchy Marx&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that there's also SCHAR. If efficiency is important, SCHAR can be a bit faster where appropriate.

Because strings are arrays and thus sequences, you can also use the more generic functions AREF and ELT (which are more general while CHAR might be implemented more efficiently).

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;Groucho Marx&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(aref *my-string* 3)
⇒ #\u
(elt *my-string* 8)
⇒ #\M
&lt;/source&gt;

== Manipulating Parts of a String ==

There's a slew of (sequence) functions that can be used to manipulate a string and we'll only provide some examples here. See the sequences dictionary in the HyperSpec for more.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(remove #\o &quot;Harpo Marx&quot;)
⇒ &quot;Harp Marx&quot;
(remove #\a &quot;Harpo Marx&quot;)
⇒ &quot;Hrpo Mrx&quot;
(remove #\a &quot;Harpo Marx&quot; :start 2)
⇒ &quot;Harpo Mrx&quot;
(remove-if #'upper-case-p &quot;Harpo Marx&quot;)
⇒ &quot;arpo arx&quot;
(substitute #\u #\o &quot;Groucho Marx&quot;)
⇒ &quot;Gruuchu Marx&quot;
(substitute-if #\_ #'upper-case-p &quot;Groucho Marx&quot;)
⇒ &quot;_roucho _arx&quot;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;Zeppo Marx&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(replace *my-string* &quot;Harpo&quot; :end1 5)
⇒ &quot;Harpo Marx&quot;
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;Harpo Marx&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Another function that can be frequently used (but not part of the ANSI standard) is replace-all. This function provides an easy functionality for search/replace operations on a string, by returning a new string in which all the occurrences of the 'part' in string is replaced with 'replacement'&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(replace-all &quot;Groucho Marx Groucho&quot; &quot;Groucho&quot; &quot;ReplacementForGroucho&quot;)
⇒ &quot;ReplacementForGroucho Marx ReplacementForGroucho&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

One of the implementations of replace-all is as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun replace-all (string part replacement &amp;key (test #'char=))
&quot;Returns a new string in which all the occurences of the part 
is replaced with replacement.&quot;
    (with-output-to-string (out)
      (loop with part-length = (length part)
            for old-pos = 0 then (+ pos part-length)
            for pos = (search part string
                              :start2 old-pos
                              :test test)
            do (write-string string out
                             :start old-pos
                             :end (or pos (length string)))
            when pos do (write-string replacement out)
            while pos))) 
&lt;/source&gt;

However, bear in mind that the above code is not optimized for long strings; if you intend to perform such an operation on very long strings, files, etc. please consider using cl-ppcre regular expressions and string processing library which is heavily optimized.

== Concatenating Strings ==

The name says it all: CONCATENATE is your friend. Note that this a generic sequence function and you have to provide the result type as the first argument.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(concatenate 'string &quot;Karl&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;Marx&quot;)
⇒ &quot;Karl Marx&quot;
(concatenate 'list &quot;Karl&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;Marx&quot;)
⇒ (#\K #\a #\r #\l #\Space #\M #\a #\r #\x)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have to construct a string out of many parts, all of these calls to CONCATENATE seem wasteful, though. There are at least three other good ways to construct a string piecemeal, depending on what exactly your data is. If you build your string one character at a time, make it an adjustable VECTOR (a one-dimensional ARRAY) of type character with a fill-pointer of zero, then use VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND on it. That way, you can also give hints to the system if you can estimate how long the string will be. (See the optional third argument to VECTOR-PUSH-EXTEND.)

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (make-array 0
                                      :element-type 'character
                                      :fill-pointer 0
                                      :adjustable t))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;&quot;
(dolist (char '(#\Z #\a #\p #\p #\a))
  (vector-push-extend char *my-string*))
⇒ NIL
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;Zappa&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

If the string will be constructed out of (the printed representations of) arbitrary objects, (symbols, numbers, characters, strings, ...), you can use FORMAT with an output stream argument of NIL. This directs FORMAT to return the indicated output as a string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(format nil &quot;This is a string with a list ~A in it&quot;
        '(1 2 3))
⇒ &quot;This is a string with a list (1 2 3) in it&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

We can use the looping constructs of the FORMAT mini language to emulate CONCATENATE.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(format nil &quot;The Marx brothers are:~{ ~A~}.&quot;
        '(&quot;Groucho&quot; &quot;Harpo&quot; &quot;Chico&quot; &quot;Zeppo&quot; &quot;Karl&quot;))
⇒ &quot;The Marx brothers are: Groucho Harpo Chico Zeppo Karl.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

FORMAT can do a lot more processing but it has a relatively arcane syntax. After this last example, you can find the details in the CLHS section about formatted output.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(format nil &quot;The Marx brothers are:~{ ~A~^,~}.&quot;
        '(&quot;Groucho&quot; &quot;Harpo&quot; &quot;Chico&quot; &quot;Zeppo&quot; &quot;Karl&quot;))
⇒ &quot;The Marx brothers are: Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo, Karl.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Another way to create a string out of the printed representation of various object is using WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING. The value of this handy macro is a string containing everything that was output to the string stream within the body to the macro. This means you also have the full power of FORMAT at your disposal, should you need it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(with-output-to-string (stream)
  (dolist (char '(#\Z #\a #\p #\p #\a #\, #\Space))
    (princ char stream))
  (format stream &quot;~S - ~S&quot; 1940 1993))
⇒ &quot;Zappa, 1940 - 1993&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;


==Joining Strings With a Delimiter==
Even though the previous section provides enough hints on how to do that, it may be the right time and place to stress how to join strings using delimiters. Assume you have a list of numbers or strings such as (192 168 1 1) or (&quot;192&quot; &quot;168&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot;) and you want to join them with the delimiter &quot;.&quot; or &quot;;&quot; to create another string. Here are some examples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-list* '(192 168 1 1))
⇒ *MY-LIST*
(defparameter *my-string-list* '(&quot;192&quot; &quot;168&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING-LIST*
(setf *result-string* (format nil &quot;~{~a~^.~}&quot; *my-list*))
⇒ &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;
*result-string*
⇒ &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;
(setf *result-string* (format nil &quot;~{~a~^.~}&quot; *my-string-list*))
⇒ &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;
*result-string*
⇒ &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;
(setf *result-string* (format nil &quot;~{~a~^;~}&quot; *my-list*))
⇒ &quot;192;168;1;1&quot;
*result-string*
⇒ &quot;192;168;1;1&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Processing a String One Character at a Time ==

Use the MAP function to process a string one character at a time.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;Groucho Marx&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(map 'string #'(lambda (c) (print c)) *my-string*)
#\G 
#\r 
#\o 
#\u 
#\c 
#\h 
#\o 
#\Space 
#\M 
#\a 
#\r 
#\x 
⇒ &quot;Groucho Marx&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Or do it with LOOP.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(loop for char across &quot;Zeppo&quot;
      collect char)
⇒ (#\Z #\e #\p #\p #\o)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Reversing a String by Word or Character ==

Reversing a string by character is easy using the built-in REVERSE function (or its destructive counterpart NREVERSE).

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;DSL&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(reverse *my-string*)
⇒ &quot;LSD&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

There's no one-liner in CL to reverse a string by word (like you would do it in Perl with split and join). You either have to use function from an external library like [http://www.cliki.net/SPLIT-SEQUENCE SPLIT-SEQUENCE] or you have to roll your own solution. Here's an attempt:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defun split-by-one-space (string)
    &quot;Returns a list of substrings of string
divided by ONE space each.
Note: Two consecutive spaces will be seen as
if there were an empty string between them.&quot;
    (loop for i = 0 then (1+ j)
          as j = (position #\Space string :start i)
          collect (subseq string i j)
          while j))
⇒ SPLIT-BY-ONE-SPACE
(split-by-one-space &quot;Singing in the rain&quot;)
⇒ (&quot;Singing&quot; &quot;in&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;rain&quot;)
(split-by-one-space &quot;Singing in the  rain&quot;)
⇒ (&quot;Singing&quot; &quot;in&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;rain&quot;)
(split-by-one-space &quot;Cool&quot;)
⇒ (&quot;Cool&quot;)
(split-by-one-space &quot; Cool &quot;)
⇒ (&quot;&quot; &quot;Cool&quot; &quot;&quot;)
(defun join-string-list (string-list)
    &quot;Concatenates a list of strings
and puts spaces between the elements.&quot;
    (format nil &quot;~{~A~^ ~}&quot; string-list))
⇒ JOIN-STRING-LIST
(join-string-list '(&quot;We&quot; &quot;want&quot; &quot;better&quot; &quot;examples&quot;))
⇒ &quot;We want better examples&quot;
(join-string-list '(&quot;Really&quot;))
⇒ &quot;Really&quot;
(join-string-list '())
⇒ &quot;&quot;
(join-string-list
   (nreverse
    (split-by-one-space
     &quot;Reverse this sentence by word&quot;)))
⇒ &quot;word by sentence this Reverse&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Controlling Case ==

Common Lisp has a couple of functions to control the case of a string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(string-upcase &quot;cool&quot;)
⇒ &quot;COOL&quot;
(string-upcase &quot;Cool&quot;)
⇒ &quot;COOL&quot;
(string-downcase &quot;COOL&quot;)
⇒ &quot;cool&quot;
(string-downcase &quot;Cool&quot;)
⇒ &quot;cool&quot;
(string-capitalize &quot;cool&quot;)
⇒ &quot;Cool&quot;
(string-capitalize &quot;cool example&quot;)
⇒ &quot;Cool Example&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

These functions take :START and :END keyword arguments so you can optionally only manipulate a part of the string. They also have destructive counterparts whose names starts with &quot;N&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(string-capitalize &quot;cool example&quot; :start 5)
⇒ &quot;cool Example&quot;
(string-capitalize &quot;cool example&quot; :end 5)
⇒ &quot;Cool example&quot;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;BIG&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(defparameter *my-downcase-string* (nstring-downcase *my-string*))
⇒ *MY-DOWNCASE-STRING*
*my-downcase-string*
⇒ &quot;big&quot;
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;big&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note this potential caveat: According to the HyperSpec, &quot;for STRING-UPCASE, STRING-DOWNCASE, and STRING-CAPITALIZE, string is not modified. However, if no characters in string require conversion, the result may be either string or a copy of it, at the implementation's discretion.&quot; This implies the last result in the following example is implementation-dependent - it may either be &quot;BIG&quot; or &quot;BUG&quot;. If you want to be sure, use COPY-SEQ.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defparameter *my-string* (string &quot;BIG&quot;))
⇒ *MY-STRING*
(defparameter *my-upcase-string* (string-upcase *my-string*))
⇒ *MY-UPCASE-STRING*
(setf (char *my-string* 1) #\U)
⇒ #\U
*my-string*
⇒ &quot;BUG&quot;
*my-upcase-string*
⇒ &quot;BIG&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Trimming Blanks from the Ends of a String ==

Not only can you trim blanks, but you can get rid of arbitrary characters. The functions STRING-TRIM, STRING-LEFT-TRIM and STRING-RIGHT-TRIM return a substring of their second argument where all characters that are in the first argument are removed off the beginning and/or the end. The first argument can be any sequence of characters.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(string-trim &quot; &quot; &quot; trim me &quot;)
⇒ &quot;trim me&quot;
(string-trim &quot; et&quot; &quot; trim me &quot;)
⇒ &quot;rim m&quot;
(string-left-trim &quot; et&quot; &quot; trim me &quot;)
⇒ &quot;rim me &quot;
(string-right-trim &quot; et&quot; &quot; trim me &quot;)
⇒ &quot; trim m&quot;
(string-right-trim '(#\Space #\e #\t) &quot; trim me &quot;)
⇒ &quot; trim m&quot;
(string-right-trim '(#\Space #\e #\t #\m) &quot; trim me &quot;)
⇒ &quot; tri&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: The caveat mentioned in the section about Controlling Case also applies here.

== Converting between Symbols and Strings ==

The function INTERN will &quot;convert&quot; a string to a symbol. Actually, it will check whether the symbol denoted by the string (its first argument) is already accessible in the package (its second, optional, argument which defaults to the current package) and enter it, if necessary, into this package. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to explain all the concepts involved and to address the second return value of this function. See the CLHS chapter about packages for details.

Note that the case of the string is relevant.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(in-package &quot;COMMON-LISP-USER&quot;)
⇒ #&lt;The COMMON-LISP-USER package, 35/44 internal, 0/9 external&gt;
(intern &quot;MY-SYMBOL&quot;)
⇒ MY-SYMBOL
⇒ NIL
(intern &quot;MY-SYMBOL&quot;)
MY-SYMBOL
⇒ :INTERNAL
(export 'MY-SYMBOL)
⇒ T
(intern &quot;MY-SYMBOL&quot;)
MY-SYMBOL
⇒ :EXTERNAL
(intern &quot;My-Symbol&quot;)
|My-Symbol|
⇒ NIL
(intern &quot;MY-SYMBOL&quot; &quot;KEYWORD&quot;)
:MY-SYMBOL
⇒ NIL
(intern &quot;MY-SYMBOL&quot; &quot;KEYWORD&quot;)
:MY-SYMBOL
⇒ :EXTERNAL
&lt;/source&gt;

To do the opposite, convert from a symbol to a string, use SYMBOL-NAME or STRING.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(symbol-name 'MY-SYMBOL)
⇒ &quot;MY-SYMBOL&quot;
(symbol-name 'my-symbol)
⇒ &quot;MY-SYMBOL&quot;
(symbol-name '|my-symbol|)
⇒ &quot;my-symbol&quot;
(string 'howdy)
⇒ &quot;HOWDY&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Converting between Characters and Strings ==

You can use COERCE to convert a string of length 1 to a character. You can also use COERCE to convert any sequence of characters into a string. You can not use COERCE to convert a character to a string, though - you'll have to use STRING instead.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(coerce &quot;a&quot; 'character)
⇒ #\a
(coerce (subseq &quot;cool&quot; 2 3) 'character)
⇒ #\o
(coerce &quot;cool&quot; 'list)
⇒ (#\c #\o #\o #\l)
(coerce '(#\h #\e #\y) 'string)
⇒ &quot;hey&quot;
(coerce (nth 2 '(#\h #\e #\y)) 'character)
⇒ #\y
(defparameter *my-array* (make-array 5 :initial-element #\x))
⇒ *MY-ARRAY*
*my-array*
⇒ #(#\x #\x #\x #\x #\x)
(coerce *my-array* 'string)
⇒ &quot;xxxxx&quot;
(string 'howdy)
⇒ &quot;HOWDY&quot;
(string #\y)
⇒ &quot;y&quot;
(coerce 'string #\y)
⇒ Type-error in KERNEL::OBJECT-NOT-TYPE-ERROR-HANDLER:
     #\y is not of type (OR CONS CLASS SYMBOL)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Finding an Element of a String ==

Use FIND, POSITION, and their -IF counterparts to find characters in a string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(find #\t &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :test #'equal)
⇒ #\t
(find #\t &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :test #'equalp)
⇒ #\T
(find #\z &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :test #'equalp)
⇒ NIL
(find-if #'digit-char-p &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot;)
⇒ #\1
(find-if #'digit-char-p &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :from-end t)
⇒ #\0
(position #\t &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :test #'equal)
⇒ 17
(position #\t &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :test #'equalp)
⇒ 0
(position-if #'digit-char-p &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot;)
⇒ 37
(position-if #'digit-char-p &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :from-end t)
⇒ 43
&lt;/source&gt;

Or use COUNT and friends to count characters in a string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(count #\t &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :test #'equal)
⇒ 2
(count #\t &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :test #'equalp)
⇒ 3
(count-if #'digit-char-p &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot;)
⇒ 6
(count-if #'digit-char-p &quot;The Hyperspec contains approximately 110,000 hyperlinks.&quot; :start 38)
⇒ 5
&lt;/source&gt;

== Finding a Substring of a String ==

The function SEARCH can find substrings of a string.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(search &quot;we&quot; &quot;If we can't be free we can at least be cheap&quot;)
⇒ 3
(search &quot;we&quot; &quot;If we can't be free we can at least be cheap&quot; :from-end t)
⇒ 20
(search &quot;we&quot; &quot;If we can't be free we can at least be cheap&quot; :start2 4)
⇒ 20
(search &quot;we&quot; &quot;If we can't be free we can at least be cheap&quot; :end2 5 :from-end t)
⇒ 3
(search &quot;FREE&quot; &quot;If we can't be free we can at least be cheap&quot;)
⇒ NIL
(search &quot;FREE&quot; &quot;If we can't be free we can at least be cheap&quot; :test #'char-equal)
⇒ 15
&lt;/source&gt;

== Converting a String to a Number ==

CL provides the PARSE-INTEGER to convert a string representation of an integer to the corresponding numeric value. The second return value is the index into the string where the parsing stopped.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(parse-integer &quot;42&quot;)
42
⇒ 2
(parse-integer &quot;42&quot; :start 1)
2
⇒ 2
(parse-integer &quot;42&quot; :end 1)
4
⇒ 1
(parse-integer &quot;42&quot; :radix 8)
34
⇒ 2
(parse-integer &quot; 42 &quot;)
42
⇒ 3
(parse-integer &quot; 42 is forty-two&quot; :junk-allowed t)
42
⇒ 3
(parse-integer &quot; 42 is forty-two&quot;)

⇒ Error in function PARSE-INTEGER:
     There's junk in this string: &quot; 42 is forty-two&quot;.
&lt;/source&gt;

PARSE-INTEGER doesn't understand radix specifiers like #X, nor is there a built-in function to parse other numeric types. You could use READ-FROM-STRING in this case, but be aware that the full reader is in effect if you're using this function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(read-from-string &quot;#X23&quot;)
35
⇒ 4
(read-from-string &quot;4.5&quot;)
4.5
⇒ 3
(read-from-string &quot;6/8&quot;)
3/4
⇒ 3
(read-from-string &quot;#C(6/8 1)&quot;)
#C(3/4 1)
⇒ 9
(read-from-string &quot;1.2e2&quot;)
120.00001
⇒ 5
(read-from-string &quot;symbol&quot;)
SYMBOL
⇒ 6
(defparameter *foo* 42)
⇒ *FOO*
(read-from-string &quot;#.(setq *foo* \&quot;gotcha\&quot;)&quot;)
&quot;gotcha&quot;
⇒ 23
*foo*
⇒ &quot;gotcha&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Converting Number to a String ==
Common Lisp provides functions such as PRINC-TO-STRING and PRIN1-TO-STRING to convert numbers into strings. If you want to concatenate a string and a number you can use them as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(concatenate 'string &quot;9&quot; (princ-to-string 8))
⇒ &quot;98&quot;
(concatenate 'string &quot;9&quot; (prin1-to-string 8))
⇒ &quot;98&quot;
(concatenate 'string &quot;9&quot; 8)

The value 8 is not of type SEQUENCE.
   [Condition of type TYPE-ERROR]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Comparing Strings ==

The general functions EQUAL and EQUALP can be used to test whether two strings are equal. The strings are compared element-by-element, either in a case-sensitive manner (EQUAL) or not (EQUALP). There's also a bunch of string-specific comparison functions. You'll want to use these if you're deploying implementation-defined attributes of characters. Check your vendor's documentation in this case.

Here are a few examples. Note that all functions that test for inequality return the position of the first mismatch as a generalized boolean. You can also use the generic sequence function MISMATCH if you need more versatility.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(string= &quot;Marx&quot; &quot;Marx&quot;)
⇒ T
(string= &quot;Marx&quot; &quot;marx&quot;)
⇒ NIL
(string-equal &quot;Marx&quot; &quot;marx&quot;)
⇒ T
(string&lt; &quot;Groucho&quot; &quot;Zeppo&quot;)
⇒ 0
(string&lt; &quot;groucho&quot; &quot;Zeppo&quot;)
⇒ NIL
(string-lessp &quot;groucho&quot; &quot;Zeppo&quot;)
⇒ 0
(mismatch &quot;Harpo Marx&quot; &quot;Zeppo Marx&quot; :from-end t :test #'char=)
⇒ 3
&lt;/source&gt;

== Splitting Strings ==

SPLIT-SEQUENCE is part of the Common Lisp Utilities collection, available at http://www.cliki.net/SPLIT-SEQUENCE.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(split-sequence:SPLIT-SEQUENCE #\Space &quot;Please split this string.&quot;) 
⇒ (&quot;Please&quot; &quot;split&quot; &quot;this&quot; &quot;string.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Chicory''' is the common name given to the flowering plants in genus ''Cichorium'' of the family [[../Asteraceae/]]. There are two cultivated species, and four to six wild species.

'''Common chicory''' (''Cichorium intybus'') is a bushy perennial herb with blue or lavender flowers. Originating from Europe, it was naturalized in North America, where it has become a roadside weed.  The roots are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and additive in the plant's Mediterranean region of origin, although its use as a coffee additive is still very popular in the American South, particularly in New Orleans, Louisiana. Common chicory is also known as '''blue sailors''', '''succory''', and '''coffeeweed'''. The plant is cultivated and used as endive under the common names '''radicchio''', '''Belgian endive''', '''French endive''', or '''witloof'''. It is grown in complete darkness to keep new leaves tender and pale.

'''Root chicory''' (''Chicorium intybus'' var. ''sativum'') has been grown since the Middle Ages as a coffee substitute. Around 1970 it was found that the root contains up to 20% inulin. Since then, new strains have been created, giving root chicory an inulin content comparable to that of sugar beet (around 600 dt/ha). Inulin  is mainly present in the plant family Asteraceae as a storage carbohydrate (for example Jerusalem artichoke, dahlia, etc.). It is used as a sweetener in the food industry (with a sweetening power 30% higher than that of sucrose). Inulin can be converted to fructose and glucose through hydrolysis.

Chicory, with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German ''Mischkaffee'' (mixed coffee), introduced during the 'coffee crisis' of 1976-1979. Chicory, especially the flower, was used as a treatment in Germany, and is recorded in many  books as an ancient German treatment for everyday ailments.

True '''endive''' (''Cichorium endivia'') is a species of chicory which is specially grown and used as a salad green. It has a slightly bitter taste and has been attributed with herbal properties. '''Curly endive''' and the broad-leafed '''escarole''' are true endives. ''C. Endiva'' root is used ethnomedically to treat dyspepsia, loss of appetite, liver and gallbladder problems, and intestinal worms, Type II Diabetes, and as a laxative for children.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Fibonacci numbers'''  form a [[sequence]] defined [[recursion definition|recursively]] by:
:&lt;math&gt;
  F(n)=
  \left\{
   \begin{matrix}
    0\,,\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\,\ \ \,&amp;&amp;\mbox{if }n=0\,;\ \ \\
    1,\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\,&amp;&amp;\mbox{if }n=1;\ \ \,\\
    F(n-1)+F(n-2)&amp;&amp;\mbox{otherwise.}
   \end{matrix}
  \right.
 &lt;/math&gt;
In words: you start with 0 and 1, and then produce the next Fibonacci number by adding the two previous Fibonacci numbers. The first Fibonacci numbers (sequence [http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi?Anum=A000045 A000045] in [[OEIS]]) for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,... are
: [[zero|0]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[8 (number)|8]], [[13 (number)|13]], [[21 (number)|21]], [[34 (number)|34]], [[55 (number)|55]], [[89 (number)|89]], [[144 (number)|144]], 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946...

==Origins==

This sequence was first described by [[Leonardo of Pisa]], who was also known as Fibonacci (c. 1200), to describe the growth of a rabbit population. The numbers describe the number of pairs in a (somewhat idealized) rabbit population after ''n'' months if it is assumed that
* the first month there is just one newly born pair,
* newly born pairs become productive from their second month on,
* we have no genetic problems whatsoever generated by inbreeding, 
* each month every productive pair begets a new pair, and
* the rabbits never die

The formula above applies to the rabbit problem because if in month ''n'' we have ''a'' rabbits and in month ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 we have ''b'' rabbits then in month ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 we'll necessarily have ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'' rabbits. That's because we know each rabbit basically gives birth to another each month (actually each pair gives birth to another pair, but it is the same thing) and that means that all ''a'' rabbits give birth to another number of ''a'' rabbits which will become fertile after two months, which is exactly at month ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2. That's why we have the population at moment ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (which is ''b'') plus exactly the population at moment ''n'' (which is ''a'').

The term ''Fibonacci sequence'' is also applied more generally to any [[Function (mathematics)|function]] ''g'' where ''g''(''n'' + 2) = ''g''(''n'') + ''g''(''n'' + 1).  These functions are precisely those of the form ''g''(''n'') = ''aF''(''n'') + ''bF''(''n'' + 1) for some numbers ''a'' and ''b'', so the Fibonacci sequences form a [[vector space]] with the functions ''F''(''n'') and ''F''(''n'' + 1) as a basis.

In particular, the Fibonacci sequence L with ''L''(1) = 1 and ''L''(2) = 3 is referred to as the '''Lucas numbers'''. This sequence was described by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1748, in the Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum. The significance in the Lucas numbers ''L(n)'' lies in the fact that raising the [[Golden ratio]] to the ''n''th power yields:

: &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac 1 2 \left( 1 + \sqrt{5} \right) \right)^n = \frac 1 2 \left( L(n) + F(n) \sqrt{5} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Lucas numbers are related to Fibonacci numbers by the relation:

:&lt;math&gt;L(n) = F(n-1) + F(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;

==Explicit formula==

As was pointed out by [[Johannes Kepler]], the ratio of adjacent Fibonacci numbers, ''i.e.'' &lt;math&gt;F(n+1)/F(n)&lt;/math&gt;, converges to the [[golden mean]] &amp;phi;. In modern form:
:&lt;math&gt;x=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F(n+1)}{F(n)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F(n)+F(n-1)}{F(n)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
=1+\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F(n-1)}{F(n)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
=1+\frac1{\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F(n)}{F(n-1)}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;
=1+\frac1x&lt;/math&gt;
or &lt;math&gt;x^2=x+1&lt;/math&gt;, a [[quadratic equation]] with &lt;math&gt;\phi, 1-\phi&lt;/math&gt; as solutions. If we multiply both sides by &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt;, we get &lt;math&gt;x^{n+2}=x^{n+1}+x^n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the two functions &lt;math&gt;n\mapsto\phi^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n\mapsto(1-\phi)^n&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; as well as all [[linear combination]]s &lt;math&gt;n\mapsto a\phi^n+b(1-\phi)^n&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; satisfy the Fibonacci recurrence.

By adjusting the coefficients to get the proper initial values ''F''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''F''(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(n\right) = {\phi^n \over \sqrt{5}} - {(1-\phi)^n \over \sqrt{5}}&lt;/math&gt;

This genrerates the closed form formula for the Fibonacci numbers as

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(n\right) = { (1+\sqrt{5})^n-(1-\sqrt{5})^n \over \sqrt{5}\cdot2^n }&lt;/math&gt;

This result can also be derived using the technique of [[generating function]]s, or the technique of solving linear [[recurrence relation]]s.

As ''n'' goes to infinity, the second term converges to zero, so the Fibonacci numbers approach the exponential &amp;phi;&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/&amp;radic;5, hence their convergent ratios. In fact the second term starts out small enough that the Fibonacci numbers can be obtained from the first term alone, by rounding to the nearest integer.

==Computing Fibonacci numbers==

Computing Fibonacci numbers by computing powers of the golden mean is not very practical except for small values of ''n'', since rounding errors will accrue and [[floating point]] numbers usually don't have enough precision.

The straightforward recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence definition is also not advisable, since it would compute many values repeatedly (unless the [[programming language]] has a feature which allows the storing of previously computed function values). Therefore, one usually computes the Fibonacci numbers &quot;from the bottom up&quot;, starting with the two values 0 and 1, and then repeatedly replacing the first number by the second, and the second number by the sum of the two.

For huge arguments and if a [[bignum]] system is being used, a faster way to calculate Fibonacci numbers uses the following [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^n =
       \begin{bmatrix} F\left(n+1\right) &amp; F \left(n\right) \\
                       F\left(n\right)   &amp; F \left(n-1\right) \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

and employs [[exponentiating by squaring]].

==Applications==

The Fibonacci numbers are important in the run-time analysis of [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]] to determine the [[greatest common divisor]] of two integers.

Matiyasevich was able to show that the Fibonacci numbers can be defined by a [[Diophantine equation]], which led to his original solution of [[Matiyasevichs theorem|Hilbert's tenth problem]].

The Fibonacci numbers occur in a formula about the diagonals of Pascal's triangle (see [[binomial coefficient]]).

In [[music]] Fibonacci numbers are sometimes used to determine tunings, and, as in visual art, to determine the length or size of [[content]] or [[form]]al elements. Examples include [[Béla Bartók]]'s ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta]]''.

==Generalizations==

A generalization of the Fibonacci sequence are the [[Lucas sequence]]s. One kind can be defined thus:

: ''U''(0) = 0
: ''U''(1) = 1
: ''U''(''n''+2) = ''PU''(''n''+1) &amp;minus; ''QU''(''n'')

where the normal Fibonacci sequence is the special case of ''P'' = 1 and ''Q'' = -1.  Another kind of Lucas Sequence begins with ''V''(0) = 2, ''V''(1) = ''P''. Such sequences have applications in number theory and [[Prime number|primality]] proving.

The [[Fibonacci polynomials]] are another generalization of Fibonacci numbers.

==Identities==

:''F''(''n'' + 1) = ''F''(''n'') + ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)

:''F''(0) + ''F''(1) + ''F''(2) + ... + ''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n'' + 2) &amp;minus; 1

:''F''(1) + 2 ''F''(2) + 3 ''F''(3) + ... + ''n F''(''n'') = ''n F''(''n'' + 2) &amp;minus; ''F''(''n'' + 3) + 2

These identities can be proven using many different methods.
But, among all, we wish to present an elegant proof for each of them using [[combinatorial proof|combinatorial arguments]] here.
In particular, ''F''(''n'') can be interpreted as the number of ways summing 1's and 2's to ''n'' &amp;minus; 1, with the convention that ''F''(0) = 0, meaning no sum will add up to -1, and that ''F''(1) = 1, meaning the empty sum will &quot;add up&quot; to 0.
Here the order of the summands matters.
For example, 1 + 2 and 2 + 1 are considered two different sums and are counted twice.

''Proof of the first identity''.
[[Without loss of generality]], we may assume ''n'' &amp;ge; 1.
Then ''F''(''n'' + 1) counts the number of ways summing 1's and 2's to ''n''.

When the first summand is 1, there are ''F''(''n'') ways to complete the counting for ''n'' &amp;minus; 1; and the first summand is 2, there are ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) ways to complete the counting for ''n'' &amp;minus; 2.
Thus, in total, there are ''F''(''n'') + ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) ways to complete the counting for ''n''.
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof of the second identity''.
We count the number of ways summing 1's and 2's to ''n'' + 1 such that at least one of the summands is 2.

As before, there are ''F''(''n'' + 2) ways summing 1's and 2's to ''n'' + 1 when ''n'' &amp;ge; 0.
Since there is only one sum of ''n'' + 1 that does not use any 2, namely 1 + &amp;hellip; + 1 (''n'' + 1 terms), we subtract 1 from ''F''(''n'' + 2).

Equivalently, we can consider the first occurrence of 2 as a summand.
If, in a sum, the first summand is 2, then there are ''F''(''n'') ways to the complete the counting for ''n'' &amp;minus; 1.
If the second summand is 2 but the first is 1, then there are ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) ways to complete the counting for ''n'' &amp;minus; 2.
Proceed in this fashion.
Eventually we consider the (''n'' + 1)-th summand.
If it is 2 but all of the previous ''n'' summands are 1's, then there are ''F''(0) ways to complete the counting for 0.
If a sum contains 2 as a summand, the first occurrence of such summand must take place in between the first and (''n'' + 1)-th position.
Thus ''F''(''n'') + ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) + &amp;hellip; + ''F''(0) gives the desired counting.
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof of the third identity''.
This identity can be establshed in two stages.
First, we count the number of ways summing 1's and 2's to -1, 0, &amp;hellip;, or ''n'' + 1 such that at least one of the summands is 2.

By our second identity, there are ''F''(''n'' + 2) &amp;minus;  1 ways summing to ''n'' + 1; ''F''(''n'' + 1) &amp;minus; 1 ways summing to ''n''; &amp;hellip;; and, eventually, ''F''(2) &amp;minus; 1 way summing to 1.
As ''F''(1) &amp;minus; 1 = ''F''(0) = 0 , we can add up all ''n'' + 1 sums and apply the second identity again to obtain
: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[''F''(''n'' + 2) &amp;minus; 1] + [''F''(''n'' + 1) &amp;minus; 1] + &amp;hellip; + [''F''(2) &amp;minus; 1]
: = [''F''(''n'' + 2) &amp;minus; 1] + [''F''(''n'' + 1) &amp;minus; 1] + &amp;hellip; + [''F''(2) &amp;minus; 1] + [''F''(1) &amp;minus; 1] + ''F''(0)
: = ''F''(''n'' + 2) + [''F''(''n'' + 1) + &amp;hellip; + ''F''(1) + ''F''(0)] &amp;minus; (''n'' + 2)
: = ''F''(''n'' + 2) + ''F''(''n'' + 3) &amp;minus; (''n'' + 2).

On the other hand, we observe from the second identity that there are
* ''F''(0) + ''F''(1) + &amp;hellip; + ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) + ''F''(''n'') ways summing to ''n'' + 1;
* ''F''(0) + ''F''(1) + &amp;hellip; + ''F''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) ways summing to ''n'';
&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
* ''F''(0) way summing to -1.
Adding up all ''n'' + 1 sums, we see that there are
* (''n'' + 1) ''F''(0) + ''n'' ''F''(1) + &amp;hellip; + ''F''(''n'') ways summing to -1, 0, &amp;hellip;, or ''n'' + 1.

Since the two methods of counting refer to the same number, we have
: (''n'' + 1) ''F''(0) + ''n'' ''F''(1) + &amp;hellip; + ''F''(''n'') = ''F''(''n'' + 2) + ''F''(''n'' + 3) &amp;minus; (''n'' + 2)

Finally, we complete the proof by subtracting the above identity from ''n'' + 1 times the second identity.
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

== Tribonacci number ==

A '''tribonacci number''' is like a Fibonacci number, but instead of starting with two predetermined terms, the sequence starts with three predetermined terms and each term afterwards is the sum of the preceding three terms. The first few tribonacci numbers are:

1, 1, 2, [[4 (number)|4]], [[7 (number)|7]], 13, [[24 (number)|24]], [[44 (number)|44]], [[81 (number)|81]], 149, 274, 504, 927, 1705, 3136, 5768, 10609, 19513, 35890, 66012

''[[OEIS]] number:'' [http://www.research.att.com/projects/OEIS?Anum=A000073 A000073]

== Tetranacci number ==

A '''tetranacci number''' is like a tribonacci number, only that starting with four predetermined terms and each term afterwards being the sum of the preceding four terms. The first few tetranacci numbers are

1, 1, 2, 4, 8, [[15 (number)|15]], [[29 (number)|29]], [[56 (number)|56]], [[108 (number)|108]], 208, 401, 773, 1490, 2872, 5536, 10671, 20569, 39648, 76424, 147312, 283953, 547337

''[[OEIS]] number:'' [http://www.research.att.com/projects/OEIS?Anum=A000078 A000078]

Pentanacci, hexanacci and heptanacci numbers have been computed, but they have not interested researchers much.

==Repfigits==

A '''repfigit''' or '''[[Keith number]]''' is an integer, that when its digits start a Fibonacci sequence with that number of digits, the original number is eventually reached.  An example is 47, because the Fibonacci sequence starting with 4 and 7 (4,7,11,18,29,47) reaches 47.  A repfigit can be a tribonacci sequence if there are 3 digits in the number, a tetranacci number if the number has four digits, etc. The first few repfigits are

14, 19, 28, 47, 61, 75, 197, 742, 1104, 1537, 2208, 2580, 3684, 4788, 7385, 7647, 7909

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two types of storage, primary and secondary storage. Primary storage deals with temporary storage and is usually called &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;main memory&quot;. Secondary storage deals with permanent storage and is usually called &quot;storage&quot;. Most memory is referred to storing media, documents...etc on chips, whereas storage stores it on disks or tapes. Memory (primary storage) is stored on RAM chips or Random Access Memory chips. Whenever you open a file from the secondary storage it is opened on the RAM and allows you to make amendments to it. When you save the file it is then moved back to the secondary storage and saved on the hard drive. Basically you can think of the secondary storage as the refrigerator and the primary storage or RAM as the counter or stove in which you cook. There are different types of RAM some which include DRAM, SDRAM, SRAM and DDR - SDRAM. DRAM is abbreviated for &quot;dynamic ram&quot; and is constantly refreshed by the PC to keep its contents. SDRAM is abbreviated for &quot;synchronous dynamic ram&quot; and is synchronized by the system clock. This allows it to be faster than DRAM and the speed is measured in megahertz. SRAM is abbreviated for &quot;static ram&quot; is faster than DRAM and keeps its contents without having to be refreshed by the PC. DDR - SDRAM is abbreviated for &quot;double-data rate synchronous dynamic ram&quot;. It is the most current RAM, it is used commonly in PC and Apple's and is also measured in megahertz.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Photoshop ====
Whenever there is a mention of photo-editing or photo-retouching or photographs in general, the software that has dominated the market is Adobe Photoshop. Every photographer that I have met who uses digital photography or does photo-editing uses photoshop for skin tones, highlighting, smoothing, etc. But using pictures in artistic ways and creating expressionist or abstract art is an intriguing field of computer graphic designing. 
 
Art is relative, what may be art to me may not be considered art by you. With a whole collection of art quotes I will use predominately one quote to justify the contents of this article. &quot;You cannot master art without the knowledge of its technique.&quot; 

Adobe Photoshop has proved to be a vital tool for me. Rather than just be for editing pictures for fun with friends or for an assignments, it proves to be very easy and efficient when it comes to graphics editing. I am currently using Adobe Photoshop 7 and the wide variety of tools enhances the whole experience. There are tools such as the clone stamp, the burn or dodge tool, paint brush, and many others. There is the optic zoom tool which allows to you to view pictures at 1600%. This basically allows you to perfect every pixel to what you want it to look like. The Clone stamp allows you to copy how every much of another graphic you want in just one easy click and brush stroke. The burn or dodge tool is used to darken a image depending on the intensity you choose. If you hold the the Alt key while doing so it does the exact opposite. So if your placing one of your friends head on Arnold Schwarzenegger's body, this makes it easier for you to match the different skin tones. It also allows for you to add text so you can title each picture with some cool fonts and funky colors.

[[File:PS Icon.svg|128px|right|]]
The newest version of Photoshop is Photoshop CS5.  It does all the things that previous versions have done but obviously has new features. It is widely used by professional photographers as well as a tool for correcting, manipulating and enhancing photos. One of the greatest things about Photoshop is that you can create actions, which allow the user to record the different tasks performed for that photograph. For example, if you regularly do 10 steps to the majority of your photographs to enhance them, Photoshop allows you to press the record button and continue with those 10 steps and then save that action. Now that it is saved all you have to do is press play in the actions box for the next photograph you want to same 10 steps to take place in.  This is one of many features that photographers use in this amazing and multifaceted software.

*'''Uses of Photoshop'''

The uses of Photoshop are plentiful, they vary from modifying photos by simple touch ups such as red eye and clarifying an image. Along with major adjustments such as color saturation, filters and image simulation or design. This allow anyone from a professional artist to a free lance photographer to import and edit any photos. It also allows image manipulation to create the picture you wanted but were unable to get due to weather or the tip of your finger in the photograph. 

*'''Editing'''

There are many ways to edit a photograph through the use of Photoshop. It can be a fine detail such increasing the contrast of the photo to allow it to be viewed better. Or complete manipulation of the entire photo. This could take shape and form in discarding the background of a photo and creating your own by substituting another image. However Photoshop is simply not only for photos. The software allows the user to design and manipulate multi-layered pages as well. 

*'''Manipulation'''

When approaching manipulation of a photograph it can a daunting experience. Considering that you maybe working on a photograph that has sentimental meaning or possible took you a long time to capture that right shot. Photoshop offers a vast number of ways to properly manipulate your photograph, from blurring the surroundings to concentrate the eye on the center of the image. Or even increasing the proportions of a photo to give it a surreal atmosphere. 

*'''Tools'''

Photoshop has about every tool you could possibly need for editing and manipulating you a photo. The tools range from animations, spot healing, red eye tool, smart sharpen and many others. For instance the spot healing tool allows the editor to completely substitute an image out and replace it with background. An example could be a persons hand partially included in a family photo, you could simple use the spot healing tool and completely edit the hand out resulting in the desired photo.

===== How to Create one type opf abstract piece =====
This is just one form and since every form and piece is different, here we just provides techniques to create one type.
 
#Start with 300 DPI RGB page size in inches 9x10&quot; ( the reason this size is suggested is because it is easier to get a frame this size.
#Insert pictures that you want to use for example a picture of a person playing a piano and picture of the beach in dawn.
#After inserting the picture you will notice that the picture is tiny on the screen. do not refrain from resizing the picture, Photoshop is good for retaining quality. However view at 100% so if you see the pixels and fuzzy boxes stop right there. Do not enlarge it any further. IT is okay if the picture looks a little bad because we will change and manipulate it so it does look good. 
#Now place the picture of the beach in the background and place the piano on top. 
#Select the piano picture go to Layers&gt; Extract image. 
#After extracting just the person and the piano place the piano on the bottom left corner of the image so you do not make the bottom of the piano visible. For it will look extracted. Hide the bottom of the piano picture. 
#Go to image&gt;adjust&gt;contrast&gt; increase the contrast drastically so you can just see the sharpened outlines of the picture..it will turn black and reddish. It is okay.
#Do the similar thing with the ocean picture.
#Go to Layers&gt; flatten image
#No go to image&gt; adjust &gt; saturation
#Click on the colorize button in the bottom and change the hue to blue.
#Go to filters&gt; pixelation&gt; and median..increase the level to adjust to your preference.
#Print and Frame.

Application Software is basically a program that allows you to open, save, amend or program a file on your computer. A common type of application software that in offices is the software suite where are a number of programs all sold together and they are used for different purposes.

&lt;u&gt;'''''Desktop   vs. Mobile Software'''''     &lt;/u&gt; 

[[File:Desktop.svg|right|100px|thumb|Add Desktop]]
Notebook computers, tablet computer, UMPCs and other portable computers run the same application software as desktop computers. Mobile phones and other mobile devices typically require mobile software that is specifically designed for a specific type of mobile phone or other mobile device. A wide range of mobile software is available today. There are mobile compatible versions to popular programs like Word or Powerpoint, games, media players and business tools that record inventory data or keep track of your business expenses, calendars and programs that allow you to organize notes and voice recording, applications that allow you to broadcast your current location to friends and web browsers for accessing web sites.
 
Many mobile applications include features for easier data input, such as an on-screen keyboard, a phrase list, or hand writing recognition capabilities. Some mobile software is designed to be compatible with popular desktop software, such as Microsoft office. 

With Mobile phone – we can do lot of things including accessing and searching the Web on most of today’s phones. Web searching is text based; mobile voice search is now available.  Mobile voice search allows you to speak, rather than type, search term into your mobile phone and then see the results of that search.
 
With Mobile software application we can able to install Google search, Yahoo search programs into Mobile software and it is easier to use once it is installed in our mobile phones.  With Mobile software application it is easier to use while on the go.  Commonly requested information includes directions to local businesses, stock quotes, flight information, local restaurants, weather information etc. Both these applications are very useful and essential in today’s busy world.

==== Software Suites ====

Software programs that have similar characteristics are often purchased bundled together in a software suite. Software suites used for creating documents are referred to as office suites or productivity software suites. Examples include word processing software, spreadsheet software, database software and presentation graphics software. 

Software suites offer advantages to users by providing programs that have a similar interface as well as its often cheaper to purchase the bundle versus each program individually.

It is well known that popular office suites like Microsoft Office is used by many individuals and businesses, there are also free and open-source alternatives to it like OpenOffice.org or even Google Office for WEB users.

==== Desktop Publishing ====
[[File:Fatpaint-editor.jpg|thumb|left|Desktop Publishing Software]]
Desktop and personal publishing software are used to create attractive documents.  The software can manipulate text and images to look as if they came from a professional printer.  Although word processing programs can also create attractive documents, desktop publishing is solely designed for this purpose, and can be more efficient.  Many people choose to use desktop and personal publishing software for this reason.  Some of the documents that can be created are greeting cards, invitations, flyers, calendars, brochures, certificates, and announcements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Short range wireless technology is used to connect personal area networks to personal electronics. These could be your cellphone, you printers, your PDAs, your MP3 players and what not. So far the most famous is Bluetooth which is now joined with Ultra wideband (UWB). It is also connected with wireless USB. Bluetooth connects cellphones, PDAs, computers and other external devices on PCs. It is a short range wireless device so it can connect to devices up to 30 feet away. Bluetooth was at first designed to replace the hassle of cables that were connecting PCs to external devices such as printers and scanners and to overcome &quot;line of sight&quot; problems by using infrared transmission. The original version of Bluetooth technology could transmit up to 720 kilobits per second and was name after Harold Bluetooth who was a Danish King who united Norway and Denmark. The Ultra wideband was a technology developed by the military to increase transfer speeds to up to 480 megabits per second. At a 30 feet connection UWB sent out millions of waves of radio energy at different frequencies every second. The broken bits were then reassembled by the UWB receiver. Sometime along in this year it is predicted that cellphones will inherit this technology and will be able to transfer media from their PCs to their cellphones without adapters or cables. Wireless USB is based on this same technology (UWB). Ranging up to 32 feet it can still transfer up to 480 megabits per second and is said to be a natural replacement for USB cables.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While Revit may appear to be a modeling program in reality it is a database with graphical, text and calculated querries. You may add or delete views without changing the model. The advantage of structuring the program like a database is that things that appear in more than one view when changed are changed in all views. The program has a built in error checking to alert user when something is moved to an invalid location - like two walls overlaping or a door outside of a wall.

''Be sure to use '''cold''' water and keep well wrapped until use.''

In contrast to [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]], pie crust and other pastries should be made in a way that minimizes the development of [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]]. Once the water has been added, the dough should be worked as little as possible, to minimize toughness in the finished crust.

== Ingredients ==

* 225 grams (1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]) all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2,5 ml (½ [[cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]]) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 230 ml (1 cup) cold vegetable [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]]
* 30 ml (2 [[cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]]) cold water (add 15 ml of water as needed]

== Procedure ==

# Combine flour and salt in medium bowl.
# Cut in vegetable shortening with a [[Cookbook:Pastry Blender|pastry blender]] or two knives, until mixture is crumbly.
# Sprinkle with cold water; blend until mixture holds together.
# Shape dough into a ball; place on lightly floured surface.
# Roll out dough to 3 mm (1/8 inch) thickness.
# Line pie plate with pastry.
# Trim around perimeter for 2 cm (1 inch) overhang to fold under and crimp as desired.

== Note ==

To make two crusts, double all ingredients, follow procedure above, and divide dough in half.

== Pie Crust Edges ==

==== Simple Fork Edge ====
# Fold overhang under and press down with your fingers.
# Using the tines of a lightly floured fork, press the edge of the pastry to the rim of the pie pan.

==== Fluted Edge ====
# Fold overhang under and pinch to make the edge stand up.
# With the thumb and forefinger of one hand, pinch the outside edge of the pastry, while pressing from the inside with the forefinger of your other hand.

==== Rope Edge ====
# Fold overhang under and pinch to make the edge stand up.
# Press the pastry along the edge of the pie plate between the side of your thumb at an angle, pinch and slightly twist.

∼How to look for a job online.

First, you need to make sure that you have an updated resume, so you can post it on these Websites for employers to look at. There are many Websites that can help you create a resume and give out excellent ideas. 

To look for jobs on www.monster.com you first need to create and account with them. Once you do that, they actually create a mini resume for you by asking a few questions about you and your previous and/or current employment. By answering all the questions you create your profile which can be viewed by people who would be interested in hiring you. Once you are done with that they ask you to upload your resume. When the process is done, Monster will post your resume in the job portal and you will receive e-mails with people asking you to interviews.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Digital Cellphones==
&quot;Digital cell phones are the second generation (2G) of cellular technology. They use the same radio technology as analog phones, but they use it in a different way. Analog systems do not fully utilize the signal between the phone and the cellular network -- analog signals cannot be compressed and manipulated as easily as a true digital signal. This is the reason why many cable companies are switching to digital -- so they can fit more channels within a given bandwidth. It is amazing how much more efficient digital systems can be. 
Digital phones convert your voice into binary information (1s and 0s) and then compress it (see How Analog-Digital Recording Works for details on the conversion process). This compression allows between three and 10 digital cell-phone calls to occupy the space of a single analog call. 

Many digital cellular systems rely on frequency-shift keying (FSK) to send data back and forth over AMPS. FSK uses two frequencies, one for 1s and the other for 0s, alternating rapidly between the two to send digital information between the cell tower and the phone. Clever modulation and encoding schemes are required to convert the analog information to digital, compress it and convert it back again while maintaining an acceptable level of voice quality. All of this means that digital cell phones have to contain a lot of processing power.&quot;

retrieved from http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cell-phone5.htm on Feb 27, 2007

Digital cellphones can run on 4 different networks and they are: TDMA, FDMA, GSM, CDMA and how they work can be found from this link http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cell-phone7.htm. 

The digital phone has revolutionized from second generation (2G) to (2.5) and to what is now the third generation (3G) of digital technology. These 3G digital phones possess greater capabilities and increased speed to handle new features such as video, gaming and internet connection.

'''Advantages of Digital Cell Phones'''

*better quality of sound and service
*more security, eavesdropping protection
*ability to support next generation services
*stronger battery life
*more resistant to noise
*increased capacity

==Analog Cellphones==
Analog was the first technology used in cell phones and uses a range of frequencies, 832; two frequencies made up a channel. 30kHz was determined to be the width of the analog voice channel because it provided the closest quality to that of a landline. Each carrier has 395 voice channels and 21 data channels. While innovative at the time they are accompanied by numerous disadvantages. The battery life and talk time is short, they are more susceptible to dropped calls and interference due to outside noise, analog is unable to provide much of the multimedia characteristics of digital phones and they require larger sources of power and therefore have a high frequency of interacting and disrupting medical devices. One of the positives of analog technology is that the coverage is superior to that of digital, in the US 95% of the country is compatible with analog. As digital cell phone technology increases, analog will become extinct due to every disadvantage of analog being solved through digital with few new draw backs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Home Automation Networks is what connects everything around a house. It connects them through switches and senors. It used a narrowband wireless technology which can operate between 100-250 feet. It is low powered and receives data slowly as compared to Personal Area Networks. it receives about 13.1-238 kilobits pers second. There are 3 cuurent standards. They are Insteon, ZigBee and Z-Wave. These are referred to as &quot;mesh technologies&quot;. Mesh Techonologies are networked devices with two way radios so that they can communicate with each other with more than just the controller. It is the central command for the network. Insteon is a standard that incorporates wireless technology in with a electric power line. This is capable of sending up to 13.1 kilobits at a range of 150 feet. As the CEO describes, &quot;drive up to your house, the garage door device recognizes yor car, and open to let you in. The lights come on and your favorite radio station starts playing.&quot; Insteon has replaced a older automation technolgy that was known as X10. ZigBee does not incorporate electric power lines into its technology therefore it is all wireless. ZigBee is very efficient, it can send up to 128 kilobits at a range of 250 feet. It is expected to be seen every from smoke detectors in your house to medical sensing devices. The best part is that it can function for a long time, on inexpensive batteries. Z-Wave also consists solely of wireless technology which is power efficient. It can send about 127 kilobits per second to a range of 100 feet. When you compare you would notice that Z-Wave and Insteon are very much similar. The only difference is that Insteon used electric power cables and Z-Wave doesn't.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Wireless Fidelity==

This alliance has been created in 1999 to try to create one world wide acceptable standard for high speed networking. So far there is about 250 members and it is growing every day. Wi-Fi is short for &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Wireless Fidelity&lt;/font&gt;. It is meant to be used with any network that is 802.11. 

These Wi-Fi products are tested and approved by the Wi-Fi trademark. It means that any of the devices that are certified by Wi-Fi are capable to work with each other. Even if the two products are made by different manufacturers. The organization is helping other developers with information on acceptable standards for today’s world network. Some of the well known current members are Nintendo, HP, US robotics, BenQ, Alpine, Lexmark, Sharp, AT&amp;T, and many more.


== Wi-Fi Hotspots ==

[[File:Chunghwa Telecom Wi-Fi available tag.jpg|thumb|Chunghwa Telecom Wi-Fi available tag]]
Wi-Fi Hotspots are establishments that offer access to the Internet via a wireless LAN network. These places allow you to access the Internet on your portable device; sometimes you will be prompted with an online agreement before using the Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi is usually used within the facility since the range is limited; once you leave the facility you lose the Wi-Fi connection. 

Many public places today offer these Wi-Fi Hotspots such as: coffee shops, restaurants, waiting rooms, libraries, and many more public places. Establishments are starting to offer Wi-Fi Hotspots more-and-more. Though it is not meant to be a primary source of Internet; it is great to use when you stop somewhere for a short time. 

&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Deborah, Charles S. Parker, and Charles S. Parker. Understanding Computers: Today and Tomorrow. 13th ed. Boston, MA: Course Technology, Cengage Learning, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Piggybacking on Wi-Fi access points is the practice of establishing an internet connection by using somebody other than your own Wi-Fi connection with out the direct consent of the other party. It is very controversial and laws vary depending on where it is being done. There are many motives for people wanting to “piggyback” off a connection. The motives vary but the main reason is the cost of internet for some people is too much.  Although no harm is meant by most individuals who perform this act, others use “piggyback” to perform illegal activities such as identity theft, child pornography, and illegal downloads. http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/05/technology/05wireless.html?pagewanted=all &lt;ref&gt;MARRIOTT MICHEL, 2006-03-05.Hey Neighbor, Stop Piggybacking on My Wireless, The New York Times. Retrieved 2012-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt;



== Personal Wi-Fi Hotspots ==

[[File:MiFi2372.jpg|thumb|Personal Mobile Hotspot Device]]
Most of the newest phones on the market today have internet access.  When you set up service, you pay not only for your telephone plan, but also a data plan as well.  This data plan allows you to use your phone to surf the web, send emails, watch videos on Netflix, and most any other web based task you can think of.  But what if you are going on vacation?  Of course you bring your phone and your laptop.  Now assume that you don’t have a data plan for your laptop (why would you after all).  Instead of surfing the net on your nice big 15” laptop screen, you are stuck watching your tiny phone screen.  Wouldn’t it be great if there was a way to share your data plan between the two devices?  Well there is.  Most mobile carriers (e.g. AT&amp;T and Verizon) offer the capability to use a ''Personal Mobile Hotspot''.  You basically turn your phone into a WiFi access point so that you can connect your laptop, or iPad, or any WiFi capable gadget to the internet.  You can also purchase a special gadget to provide the hotspot (e.g. Verizon’s MiFi device) instead of using your phone.  Of course the carriers will normally charge extra for this feature, but the incremental cost is usually less than setting up a new data plan for each device.


== Wi-Fi SD Cards ==
A convenient new technology that has become available recently is the Wi-Fi SD card. An example is the brand Eye-Fi. Eye-Fi SD cards were the first memory card to automatically upload videos and photos using Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi SD card not only works with your camera and stores media, but the built-in Wi-Fi lets you instantly send photos to your computer, smartphone, or other device. There is also the security of knowing your photos are safe on your home computer/online. The cards are useful in the case of personal pictures being lost through theft, damage to the card/camera, or losing the camera. 

&lt;small&gt;Reference: Morely, Deborah; Parker, Charles. Understanding Computers Today and Tomorrow. Course Technology, 2011, Page 282.&lt;/small&gt;



==How Wi-Fi works==

Wi-Fi uses two types of frequency carrier: a single direct-sequence area distributed spectrum radio carrier and a multi-carrier OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) radio technology. 
&quot;There are two common ways to put information in a radio wave, and you've likely run into them yourself. They are called A.M. and F.M. just like the two choices you've always known are on a radio. To understand these two ways of sending information it is important to know that radio waves, by themselves, have very regular patterns. Generally they keep the same amplitude or frequency all the time. (Amplitude is the &quot;height&quot; of the radio wave, frequency is how close the waves are to each other.)&quot; [Forbus, K. and Gentner, D. 1997].
http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/Communications/1-how-is-data-put-on-radio-waves.html [http://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/Communications/1-how-is-data-put-on-radio-waves.html]
http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/81/Wi-Fi_logo.png
[http://nrj.blogs.com/solutions_mobilite/2005/02/index.html]

The speed of a Wi-Fi connection depends on many different factors.  First, it can become slower if there are a lot of solid objects between the computer being used and the access point.  Also, the amount of interferences can play a role in making the connection slower.  For instance, baby monitors, microwaves, and other devices that operate on the same frequency can affect it.  Finally, the type of hardware used may affect the connection.  Wi-Fi connections are typically between 100 and 300 feet indoor and 300-900 feet outdoors.  Distance can be extended using devices designed for that purpose such as antennas.

==How to Protect Yourself When Using Wi-Fi==
While using Wi-Fi hot spots may be convenient, you must always think about protecting your computer. Wi-Fi is less secured than a wired network. A suggestion to keep your hard drive safe is to turn off file sharing when using a Wi-Fi hotspot  so no one has access to any personal information. Another idea is to turn off automatically connecting to a Wi-Fi spot on your computer, so you can choose what networks you want to join. A user should also look and see what Wi-Fi network the computer is connected to. By doing this, this ensures they are on a secured Wi-Fi and not a Wi-Fi spot that someone set up to hack into your computer.

==WiMAX==
WiMAX is similar to Wi-Fi, but instead WiMax is designed for a longer wireless network connection. WiMax is able to cover a certain location but coverage can extend up to six miles, it has the ability to cover a broader geographical range. The areas covered by Wi-Fi are known as Hotspots, while WiMax covered areas are called Hotzones. WiMax can provide coverage for an entire city by using WiMax towers. WiMaz utilizes radio frequencies like Wi-Fi to avoid interference.  
There is also a mobile version of WiMax, called Mobile WiMax. Mobile WiMax enables cellphone or portable computer users to stay connected through a wireless broadband network.

==WiFi and Smartphones==

When using your phone while it is connected to a WiFi network your mobile data plan does not get deducted. It is not possible to write the specific details for all phones, since all of them are slightly different, but here are some directions on how to connect to a WiFi network on your smartphone:

BLACKBERRY:

• Go to the Applications menu 

• Click on the icon for Setup WiFi 

• Click Next

• Your Blackberry will scan for networks. When the list of available networks appears click on the network you would like to connect to

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many threats out there. Most people believe that they are kept safe from them but however 2/3 of these people don't even have a firewall. More don't even know what a denial-of-service, a worm, a virus or a Trojan horse means. A denial-of-service attack is basically a number of requests by the computer or the network. This then overloads the network and denies legitimate users access to the network. Since most computers have a certain number of limited user requests at a given time a denial-of-service attack will inhibit them all. This kind of attack will either come from one computer or maybe even more because those computer will have been taken over as well. A worm is a program that, when is on a system, copies itself over and over again. This could cause the computer to crash. There have been many recorded worms before. Code Red, Nimda, Klez, SQL Slammer, MyDoom and Sasser. Viruses are a pain in the neck. There are &quot;deviant&quot; programs that store themselves on your hard drive and then cause all sorts of ruckus of your computer. They could corrupt data or literally blow up something. A way of transport of viruses are through email. The most famous was the love bug email. The subject line was &quot;I LOVE U&quot;. It resulted in about $10 million worth of damage. Viruses can also do annoying things. Like have a pop up telling you to legalize marijuana, or have ping pong balls shooting around. It could even spread to external devices like your camera flash card and destroy it as well. Trojan Horses...Remember the story of the Trojan war? When the Greek soldiers tricked the Trojans into letting them into the grounds? Well, the Greek soldiers would be the virus. The Trojan horse would be the decoy Trojan horse that got them in. A Trojan horse is basically a carrier for viruses. It shows itself as a program that could be of great use to you. It could be a game or a screensaver but when its installed the instructions are to destroy or corrupt data on your computer. The worm, the virus and the Trojan horse are all apart of Malware. Malware is malicious software that is designed to attack a computer.

== New Challenges for Cybersecurity ==

[[File:Malware_logo_1.png|thumb|Computer Virus]]

Many experts believe that 2012 will bring new challenges for cyber security.  Security giant McAfee release a report titled ‘2012 Threat Predictions’ that detailed an expected rise in attacks against the U.S.  Many of these threats are believe to be politically-motivated.   There is also expected to be an increase in smartphone viruses.  Panda Security predicts that foreign cyber espionage as well as social networking attacks will both contribute to a loss in government, corporate, and personal data.  They believe that these data thefts should be a top security issue that organizations focus on this year.  Both companies agree that Privacy violations will only increase in 2012.

On February 13, 2013, Representative Mike J. Rogers introduced the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA). This bill was design to protect or prevent cyber-attacks on the government and infrastructure.  If the bill is passed, it would allow private companies to share data with law enforcement and government agencies with the hope it would help solve or prevent cyber-attacks without the need to go through legal channels. Included in the bill, immunity from legal action for the government and private companies that share data. Proponents of the bill say the wording is much too vague which allows for individual interpretation. This bill shows the delicate balance of protection vs. privacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computers have become an essential necessity concerning education in the today’s world. Examples of this would be the use of: power point presentations in classrooms, Blackboard, email, and editing. 

May professors use power point presentations to lecture a particular class, its makes it much easier for the professor to teach a subject with power point slides.

Also, the use of the online Blackboard has enabled professors to communicate much more effectively. Students these days are enabled to complete assignments and hand them in online via Blackboard. This makes it more convenient to complete assignments from anywhere; from home, work, or even across the world. The use of email also does the same thing. 

Editing assignments has become easier for students because of computers. The use of spell and grammar checkers like in Microsoft Word make editing a lot faster than before. Also, this saves paper and time. The students no longer have to print out rough copies and re-write assignment that require corrections; rather they just edit everything and print out the final copy once all the editing is completed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bilinear Conversion ==

Provided sampling rate is not far in excess of the largest frequency component,
a quick term-to-term conversion can use as approximation:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt; z-term= e^{-w*T}*[1-A*(4*w/w_s)^B]   &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

        where Ws=sampling rate &lt;Nyquist rate (rad/s)&lt;br&gt;
                T=sampling period, sec =2PI/Ws&lt;br&gt;
                w=s-term, real or complex&lt;br&gt;
                4w/Ws &lt;=1        (A,B)=(0.85,3.17)  &lt;br&gt;

for example, the s-term  (s+5.0) with T=2PI/40 yields z-term (z-0.4129).&lt;br&gt;
Similarly, term s^2+2.31s+2.72 becomes z^2-1.64z+0.70&lt;br&gt;

there are existing rules for introducing additional z-terms as needed to stabilize and improve magnitude match.&lt;br&gt;

For moderate sampling rate the bilinear transform sees a divergence region for frequency response towards the Nyquist limit.&lt;br&gt;

This can be improved by applying a slightly increased sampling rate up to the original Nyquist limit, at least with well conditioned transfer functions ie positive real.--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] 21:05, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

Perhaps an example could be added to illustrate how to use it? Especially the frequency prewarping technique.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, does anyone know if there is any way to move the 3D cursor using the keyboard? Or is there a way to move an object relative to the center of the scene using the keyboard? I need to find out how to do one of these, because otherwise I have to leave the cursor where it started which isn't easy (sometimes I accidentally left click). After that, any objects that I create will never be an exact distance from objects created before the cursor was moved.

I don't know if you still need help but, if you press shift+C, the cursor will move to the center of the grid, or if you press shift+s, you can snap the cursor to the closest intersection on the grid.

      <comment>/* History of the Web Camera */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A web cam is a device that usually connects to the computer via a USB port. A web cam takes what it sees in it's lens and transmits it to the computer as an image.

Now a days web cams are used for a variety of things. For example, you can chat with a friend or relative across the globe and have a video conference so you can see them and they can see you. Web cameras posses many positive and negative qualities. 

==History of the Web Camera==

In 1991, the Web Camera was born in Cambridge University, in the Trojan room coffee pot, in the computer science department. [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/qsf/coffee.html]

On this website you will see the first image of the Trojan room coffee pot that the web camera gave; as well as a detailed description of how the science department configured the camera.



Web cameras are a magnificent choice for people who want to share information via the Internet. It's main role is to show a video with sound from one computer onto another computer and vice versa with just a web camera to gather what its sharing. This allows people in any situation to converse over the web however they want. Web cameras are made in different sizes and shapes. Some web cameras are built inside a computer and some are round with a camera in the center. Any web camera, as long as its not built in can be placed anywhere and used whenever it is plugged into a system that allows web camera usage. Web camera are nothing more than a camera that can record data and send it out, while receiving it simultaneously . It also can transfer data instantly allowing multiple people to use a web camera at the same time together.

==The Advantages of Web Cameras==
* A web cam enables individuals to monitor their home while away   
* A web cam can be used to take pictures and make videos
* Older individuals who have difficulty leaving their home but who want to still keep in touch with their friends can use a web cam to do so 
* Hearing Impaired individuals find the web cam useful when communicating with others 
* With a web cam you can observe your babysitter's behaviour toward your child 
* Inter-office communication between cities can be set up at a reasonable cost (i.e. video-conferencing at a fraction of the price)
* Useful for individuals who have social anxiety and don't like to meet people in person, perhaps a blind date situation
* Communication can be ended at any time at the click of your mouse

==The Disadvantages of Having a Web Cam==
* A potential invasion of privacy exists 
* Because web cams have high quality resolution and are easy to use, they can be used to exploit children through pornography
* Web cams are movable which increases the risk for damage
* Web cams remove the need to socialize in person creating a lack of human interaction
* As people spend more time watching TV, surfing the internet, playing computer games, etc., the web cam is yet another health hazard

==The Different Types of Web Cameras==
* IP Camera

==The Price of a Web Camera==
The price of a web camera varies quite a bit depending on what additional features you require in a web camera. Here are a few different web cameras on the market, note prices included are published MSRP and may vary by retailer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Evil Twin Attack?==
It is an unsecured wireless network attack, which allows hackers to steal your personal information.

==How the Evil Twin Attack works==
For instance, let's say you arrive at your destination and you need to access the internet to check if your pay check has been processed into your account. You open your laptop and sign on to the internet not knowing that the access point is the one of the hackers. Initially you type the address of your bank website. Everything is going smoothly, and you believe that you have entered a secure website. You enter in your bank card number and your password, not realizing that the website that you are using is a fake website, which resembles the official bank website. The only difference between the websites is that the fake one is unencrypted(its open for hackers to see your secure information). This way somebody else is stealing your information without your knowledge. Hackers create an access point on any network and by doing so they are able to track your every move, they can even read your mail with you.

==How to protect yourself from an Evil Twin Attack==
* Check your wireless internet setting to ensure that you are logged onto a secured connection. 
* Ensure your pop-up protection for adware is enabled.
* When using credit cards designate one credit card for internet purposes, with a low limit.
* Do not use public wireless connections when conducting private business.

      <text xml:space="preserve">='''Monitors'''=

== CRT ==
CRT stands for Cathode-ray tube, this type of monitor was the most widely used until the release of LCD monitors (and TVs), the same technology employed was the same as the one used in common televisions screens. The Cathode ray projects a series of electrons onto a screen to ultimately produce an image, however the process of electrons to an image is much more tedious than a simple conversion.

CRT monitors soon became inexpensive and have been always easy to maintain, even more if compared with newer technologies. But in a competitive world, TVs and monitor had to changed over the years. Today many companies have halted their production of CRT monitor due to drastic decrease in revenue due to tighter energy standards and new competing technologies. Most companies have recorded a decrease of half of what CRT monitors used to bring. More companies are focusing on big demand of the new LCD monitors. It is a changing world and you have to change with it.

The biggest advantage of the CRT is that it is cheaper to manufacture which enables the poor countries to afford such a product the another, still unmatched, other advantages are the capacity for brightness, the color precision (CRTs still provide richer color in a fuller variety than most LCDs, here they will have a lasting niche market), a rapid refresh rate (important for fast changing graphics), an increased viewing angle (CRT provides the same brightness and color from a variety of different viewing angles), multiple resolutions and a lower purchase price.

Some negative points of CRT monitors is that they are power hungry (most was wasted as heat) and take more material to construct, they tend to be heavy and large. The CRT screen also lacked the newer technologies, glare from the surroundings could cause reflection, resulting in a poor quality for viewing.

=== History of the CRT ===
This type of monitor was possible due to a German scientist named Karl Ferdinand Braun that in 1897 invented the first cathode ray tube. Braun introduced a CRT with a fluorescent screen, known as the cathode ray oscilloscope - an oscilloscope is an electronic display device containing a cathode ray tube (CRT), used to produce visible patterns that are the graphical representations of electrical signals. The screen would emit a visible light when struck by a beam of electrons.

A Russian scientist, named Boris Rosing, in 1907 used a CRT in the receiver of a television system. Rosing also transmitted crude geometrical patterns onto the television screen and was the first inventor to do so using a CRT. The first practical signal generating tubes were invented by Vladimir K. Zworykin and Philo T. Farnsworth.

Only in the 1940’s were the first CRT produced in the form of Televisions. Even though it was developed over hundred years ago, scientists have improved its picture quality over time. But it still runs on the same basic principles. Today the way a CRT tube works seems very simple and is used still in most TV screens and, in lowering numbers, as PC monitor.

=='''LCD'''==
LCD or liquid crystal display screens are the newest and sharpest screens. Even though the use of LCD screens have been around for a long time, the technology has only been recently incorporated into the use of both televisions and computer monitors. The LCD screen uses rare characteristics that make it much more appealing than conventional CRT monitors. One of the key characteristics of LCD screens are the size advantage compared to a conventional CRT screen, a LCD screen does not employ the use of a cathode ray. But instead layers of filters and glass which polarize light and project onto liquid crystals which reveal sharp quality and excellent detail of the picture. Another interesting aspect of LCD screens is that there is almost no reflection of light from the surroundings into the screen.  

====='''Other Advantages of the LCD Monitors'''=====
*Brightness- the LCD monitor has a brightness of 250 to 300 nits
*No flicker- there is no flicker on a LCD, because it has a constant source of light over the whole screen
*Power consumption- consumes less power than the CRT, approximately one-third
*Ergonomics- the dimensions and the weight of the LCD permit it to consume less space. Example: mounting it on a wall
*Low emissions- LCDs cause no electromagnetic interference  

'''Disadvantages of the LCD Monitor'''

*Blurry images outside native resolution
*Motion blur on fast moving images
*Some models have reduced color clarity     [[File:Samsung Galaxy Tab Japanese edition.jpg|thumbnail|right|Touch screen tablets are compact and user-friendly.]]
&lt;br /&gt;
== '''Plasma Dislays''' ==
Plasma displays are a type of flat-panel display. They have a comparable look to LCD displays and also use layered technology. However, instead of using liquid crystals like the LCD, plasma displays utilize a layer of gas between two glass plates. In plasma displays a phosphor-coated screen is used. Each pixel in the display is comprised of three cells encompassing the primary colors of visible light. Electronic charges are applied to make the gas atoms light up the phosphors to generate the image on the screen.  In general, plasma displays tend to have a better contrast ratio, wider viewing angles, and less motion blur compared to LCD screens. On the other hand, plasmas are apt to use up greater electricity and older generation displays were more susceptible to screen burn-in and image retention.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Apple TV and Sony flatscreen TV at Macworld-2007-01-10.jpg|thumb|Sony Plasma Display with Apple TV]]

=='''Touch Screens'''==
A touch screen is monitor-like peripheral that allows a user to input information into a computer without using a mouse or keyboard. Just like its name- you simply touch the screen to make a selection. Touch screens are found in a variety of places: personal computers, tablets, self-checkouts, ATMs, cell phones and even some cars. Touch screens are generally compact and can be stored in various places. Some are mounted on walls, held up by brackets or built into countertops.  There are disadvantages to touch screens for people with certain disabilities. People who are blind or have limited mobility may not be able to full access and use a touch screen to the same level as others. 
&lt;ref&gt;Information found in Chapter 3 of Understanding Computers: Today and Tomorrow, 13th Edition by Deborah Morley and Charles S. Parker.&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Electronic Paper'''==
[[File:Amazon Kindle 4.jpg|thumb|Amazon Kindle 4]]
Have you seen the Amazon Kindle or Sony E-Reader?  If you have, you’ve noticed that the screen looks almost exactly like a printed sheet of paper.  That’s because these devices use electronic paper (e-paper) for their display. An electronic paper display uses a technology called electrophoretics that was developed by E Ink Corporation.  The technology uses tiny charged white and black ink particles to simulate the look of paper.  An applied voltage pulls either the white or black beads to the top of the screen, while the opposite beads fall to the bottom, thus giving the contrasting look of the words versus background on the screen.  The technology requires much less power than other flat panel display technologies because there is no back-light needed and no power required to maintain the display, only to change the display.  Devices using this technology are much easier to read in direct sunlight as well.

=='''OLEDs'''==
Organic light emitting diode (OLED) a type of flat-panel display that may one day replace LCD technology.  OLED displays use layers of organic material which emits light when electric current is applied.  OLEDs are more energy efficient than LCDs because they don’t use backlighting which also lengthens the battery life of portable devices.  Other advantages of OLEDs is that they are thinner than LCDs and have a wider viewing angle, so the display is visible from all angles.  Another advantage of OLEDs is that they support new technologies such as flexible OLED (FOLED) in which the display is built on a flexible surface, allowing is to roll up when the device is not in use, and transparent OLED (TOLED) where the part of the display that doesn’t have an image is totally transparent.  This could open up possibilities such as the use of displays on windows, auto windshields, and other transparent items.
[[File:Computer monitor.jpg|100px|thumb|Flat Panel Display]]

=='''Digital Vs Analog'''==
Analog and digital signals rely on two very different ways of translation. Analog is initially a digital signal that becomes translated by a graphics card into an analog signal which is than used for the display of the monitor. However the problem in this process is that quality and definition becomes “lost” in the translation from digital to analog, resulting in less sharpness and depth. Now a digital signal when properly connected to a DVI or digital video interface allows the digital signal to be directed right to monitor with no translation.DVI provides high-speed digital interface through Transition Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS). A transmitter on the video adapter transfers digital data to a receiver in the monitor. TMDS accepts the signal from the video adapter, determines the resolution and refresh rate that the monitor is using, and spreads the signal out over the available bandwidth to optimize the data transfer from computer to monitor. This results in a higher quality picture that appears more crisp and clean.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Malware consists of worms, viruses and Trojan horses. The similarity between these three is that all three are aimed at attacking your PC. There are many ways in which malware is spread. Some methods include: By infected floppies or CD's, Boot-sector virus, File Virus, Multipartite virus, Macro virus, Logic bomb, Trojan horse and email hoax. The first way, an infected floppy or CD can have a virus loaded on it. This could be a prank from a friend or a repair person. A boot-sector virus is a virus that is sitting in the boot-sector of your computer. That is where all the boot up information is stored for proper boot up procedures. When it is infected with a virus, the virus delivers its own instructions and then attacks your computer freely. If any other disk or CD is put into the PC that too becomes infected. If this disk or CD are then put into another computer that computer too becomes infected. File viruses attach themselves to files that start up programs. So when the file is activated the virus then turns active and then tries to work its way into the memory and infect other files as well. Multipartite virus is a hybrid virus between a file virus and a boot-sector virus. This makes it really hard to detect. A type of multipartite virus is the polymorphic virus. Just like a human virus it can change form. This makes it really hard to be detected and also changes its own profile so any antivirus cant pick up on it. The Macro virus attaches itself to mini procedures in miniature programs, those which are found in emails or spreadsheets. These are called Macros. Until recently these files have been ignored by anti virus programs. Next we have the logic bomb. These are viruses that are programmed to go off at a certain time and date. A Trojan horse is basically a carrier for viruses. It appears to be a useful program but has viruses that are attached to it ready to attack. These are emails that have been sent to warn people about a virus. However on its way through the Internet a virus get attached to it, and with a warning saying make sure to send it to everyone you know, it causes catastrophic results.

==Types of Trojan Horses==
Trojan Horses cannot replicate themselves like viruses and worms. There are seven main types of Trojan Horses:

1.	Remote Access Trojan (RAT):  They can be downloaded from small files such as free software, games, or electronic greeting cards. Once downloaded, the intruder can gain complete administrative control of the computer gaining knowledge of every key stroke made; which can include sensitive personal information of the user.

2.	 Data Sending Trojan: Relays sensitive information back to the intruder, such as credit card information, email addresses, log files, and so on. Some are used to relay information and not intended for malicious acts. Instead they are used to serve ads to the user. Hackers gain data of the user’s Web activity and site visited to serve corresponding ads to the user.

3.	Destructive Trojan: This Trojan is used to destroy data on the user’s computer.

4.	Proxy Trojan: Uses the victim's computer as a proxy server. The Hacker can then execute any illegal or malicious act from the user’s computer over the internet.

5.	FTP Trojan: Installs a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) on the user’s machine. The Trojan then opens port 21 to the attacker allowing the system to try to download and upload files from the user’s computer.

6.	Security software disabler Trojan: Designed to disable firewall and antivirus software allowing the attacker to invade the user’s computer.

7.	Denial-of-Service attack Trojan: Initially installed through a RAT Trojan. One of the more popular RATs is the SubSeven Trojan from various computers routed to the victim’s service. Affected machines are referred to as Zombies.

==Mobile Malware==
[[File:Sony Ericsson A5402S for au.jpg|100px|thumb|A Mobile Phone]]
Malware can infect mobile phones, portable digital media players, printers, and other devices that have computing hardware and software, just as well as computers. Bluetooth devices are particularly vulnerable because they can be infected via a Bluetooth connection just by being 30 feet from a carrier of the malware.

Mobile Malware is supposed to make the phone difficult to use, by moving icons around or crashing the phone. Sometimes the malware is money-oriented and can steal credit card data located on the mobile phone. As mobile devices continue to add more and more software components, they become more vulnerable to the malware. So in the future, where most mobile phones will have become more complicated and have software components, there will be more malware attacks. The good news is that the lack of a universal operating system for mobile devices limits the amount of mobile malware currently in circulation.

      <comment>/* Why are they important? */ - I added information on the use of video cards for dual monitor capability.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Video Cards are specific pieces of hardware a computer system uses to display all images on the monitor. A video card is the apparatus that the monitor plugs into the mother board.     

They do not require:
*their own power plug from the power source.
*require a separate card. 

Video card range from:
*different qualities 
*different memory size.
*The more megapixels the video card can display onto the monitor, the better the resolution; meaning it has a better image quality.

Video cards most often have built in memory; which determines how fast and smooth a video card can change and display images. Years ago,video cards were usually 8MBs; today, the most common video cards in PCs are approximately 256MBs. This has enabled higher quality images in games and DVDs. Without video cards the monitor cannot be attached to the computer and will not display images. As well, another fundamental trait of the video card is that it requires it's own driver in order to function to its fullest potential.

==Why are they important?==
Video cards are important to everyday users, as well as businesses and large firms. Video cards enable the computer monitor to display more colors, clearer images, and better quality images. A video card converts the processor's output info into a signal that can be sent to the monitor. The uses of a video or graphics card are numerous, programs like CAD and other design software needs to be detailed and very precise. Another use is for dual monitors. Employees today are expected and/or required to work on multiple programs at the same time and complex spreadsheets and reports. Having dual monitors makes working on those tasks move along much more efficiently and therefore improves employee productivity. In order to do this, you need to have either multiple video cards or a video card that supports dual monitors. As well, a video gamer may want better resolution and better quality picture for the game they are playing.  Video cards have evolved along with computers, from displaying black and white, to the multitude of colors available now.

      <comment>/* Deleting Files and Folders */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A file can be defined as a collection of data or information. However, the computer treats every file like a single unit. Therefore each file has a filename. For example a file created in word is different from a file created in a wave editing program. There are two types of files. There are Program files and Data Files. Program files, at heart, can be described as files containing software instructions. Program files are then made up by two files called, source program files and executable files. Source program files contain the original form of instructions from the creator. These are then translated in executable files so the processor can interpret them and carry out the function of the file. The Other type of main file is Data files. These are basically to hold data. These are not like program files in which they actually carry out a function on the computer. Rather they contain information that is to be acted on by the program files. There are they types of files that make up data files. These are Graphic Files, Audio files and Animation/Video files. Graphic files can easily be thought of, of the pictures you see. Audio Files are the music files you listen to. Animation/Video files are the movies or clips that you watch on your computer.

===Copying and Moving Files and Folders===

Copying and moving files and folders is a very easy and simple task to do. It helps you keep your computer organized and helps to keep you folders readily available. The first step to take in order for you to do this is to find the folder that you want to move. Then you highlight (select) the folder and right click to copy or cut the folder. This copies the file to the clipboard. Then you will go to the location where you want to put the file and right click and paste it there. (This is for windows 7).[[File:Folderrr.jpg|thumb|right]]


===Deleting Files and Folders===

This task is very useful to keep your computer clean and organized. You might want to delete these files to keep your computer organized or even to get your computer going faster. The first step to take to delete a file or folder is to go to the drive and folder where your file is located. Then you will select that file and drag it to the recycle icon on your desktop. What you can also do is select and press the delete key. This will delete your folder. If you delete a folder it will delete every file in that folder.

Serve your pumpkin pie warm or cold, topped with whipped cream or not!

==Ingredients==

* ¾ [[cookbook:cup|cup]] (180g) granulated [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* ½ [[cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
* ½ teaspoon ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* ¼ teaspoon ground [[cookbook:Clove|cloves]]
* 2 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1 can (15 ounces - 425g) [[cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]
* 1 can (12 fluid ounces - 350ml) evaporated [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* 1 unbaked nine inch [[Cookbook:Pie Crust|pie shell]]
* [[cookbook:Whipped Cream|whipped cream]]
* '''NOTE:''' 1¾ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice may be substituted for the cinnamon, ginger, and cloves; however, the taste will be slightly different.

==Procedure==

# Preheat oven to 425°F (210c)
# Mix sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves in small bowl. Beat eggs in large bowl; stir in pumpkin and sugar spice mixture. Gradually stir in evaporated milk.  
# Pour into the unbaked pie shell.
# Bake at 425°F (210c) for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350°F (180c) 40-50 minutes or until knife inserted near center come out clean. Cool on wire rack 2 hours.  
# Let cool and serve.
# Top with whipped cream before serving.

==Notes and tips==

'''Before you bake.''' Make the batter ahead, if you wish, but pour it into the pie shell just before baking to keep the crust crisp.

'''During baking.''' The baking instructions start with a high oven temperature, then direct you to reduce the heat partway through baking. This is an important step which allows the crust time to crisp.

'''Is it done?''' Insert a knife near the center of the pie to test for doneness, as the center will still cook after you take the pie out of the oven.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A server is nothing more than a computer that provides services to other computers. In any computer can be a server the only thing you have to do is enable file sharing and others are able to copy files to and from your computer. But the main question is it a good or fast server?, That depends on you machine. 
There are different types of servers here a list of some basic once:
Mail server - a computer optimized to handle email. What could mean it was a lot of hard disk space.
Print server - a computer optimized for printing that could mean it had a big hard disk space.
Web server - that could be a shared or dedicated. Shared means that it could host more then 1 site and dedicated means that it is only hosting one.

So in conclusion a server is just a computer that's been selected to perform a specific task in service to others and the task that makes the difference.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many times we have head people saying “ I can’t get onto that website because of the firewall”. What does that mean? Most of the computers at home and in large corporations are protected by a firewall. It protects the computers from potential hackers. It protects you from all the threats that are trying to enter your computer. That is why it’s called firewall. It allows information to go through or it doesn’t allow the information to go through. For instance, in a large company there are hundreds of computers connected to the network. All these networks are in interests of hackers. If there is a hole that is not covered hackers would enter and exploit that hole. That’s when firewall comes in and protects. A company can have a large control of what is getting downloaded, what websites employees enter and how, even controlling what website are not to be entered at work. Suck treats that it protects us from are: macros, email bombs, spam, viruses etc. There are three levels of firewall protection. The best one to use is the highest level of security. It will block everything but it’s the best way to start and allow only the sites that you choose to come into your computer.

==== Security Devices ====

	The Statefull firewall is one of the most common business security devices 

'''Stateful Firewall'''  -  The stateful Firewall in business allows for the most flexibility in providing secure Internet access.  This type of firewall inspects the outgoing packets and retains the destination and source information of the packet in memory.  The stateful firewall will then only authorize those sender and receiver packets to traverse the Network.  One important aspect of the stateful firewall is that a Network administrator can define specific polices defining which type of packets would be allowed to traverse a business’s private network.  These policies can be defined in relation to protocols and applications which the firewall refines the inspection of the session. 1 http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=373120</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''digital camera''' is a device that captures an image into an electronic imaging sensor. Usage of a disk instead of a film provides immediate photos that can be stored, viewed in a desktop or printed right at home in a matter of minutes.

The Camera and the idea of creating a real image was adopted long ago in Ancient Greece. The camera much evolved gaining more advantages from previous creations. NASA revolutionized the world of photography from its need to develop an effective method of sending high powerful images back to Earth from all of its space missions. The quality of these pictures is determined by megapixels; the more the higher the resolution it will have. Today a vareity of Cameras are present which ranges in size, weight, quality, picture, and formats. The major producers of digital camera's include Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, Olympus, Canon, and Casio but Kodak was the first to release the first consumer digital camera back in 1991.

==Digital SLRs==
Digital SLRs bring together the best of both worlds between high quality single lens reflex (SLR) film camera and digital cameras. Digital SLR's focuses on giving high manual control to the user through swappable lenses, manual control feature such as zoom, aperture, and depth of field and exposure control. If you want to let the camera do the work, most digital SLRs also have multi point focus and many of the same features that normal digital cameras have. Some advantages to the digital SLRs is that the start usually with higher mega pixels, which allows the ability to crop and blow up images with no image quality loss, as well as being able to store the photos in multiple formats such as jpeg and RAW. RAW images retain every last pixel of the image data, combine this with high mega pixel, this makes a perfect situation for users to edit their photos and still maintaining a high quality image. Some of the disadvantages to digital SLRs are usually quite a bit bigger, bulkier as compared to regular digital cameras and significantly more expensive.

==Photo Editing==
One of the most significant advantages to digital cameras is the ability to alter the photographs after they have been taken. Many digital cameras that are bought in store today are accompanied by software specific to the brand of camera. As well, Windows XP itself contains a program which allows the alteration of photographs. In these programs an individual is able to modify the the image in a number of ways, such as:
#Adjusting the brightness of the image
#Repairing red eye
#Inserting or removing people or objects 
#Applying textures
#Adjusting contrast 
#Cropping the image

The above alterations and more allow each individual to alter their photos to their true potential. No longer are we stuck with half a roll of film of unusable pictures, no wasted money or time. When the alteration process is completed the user is able to print the best and most loved photos.

===Adjusting Brightness===
Previously when a photo was overexposed or underexposed it would have been thrown out; the photo was not usable. Even is the photography was impeccable, the negative influences of the setting would have ruined the picture. In cameras that are not digital the amount of light which was available was a major determining factor as to the quality outcome of the picture. While light still plays a role, it is not quite as critical because it can be altered after the fact.

===Repairing Red-Eye===
The destructive force of red-eye used to plague many-a-photo. Though the image was not lost the mood often drowned behing the focus of the red eyes. With the ability to alter photos a click of a button will significantly reduce the look of red eyes restoring the original integrity to the image.

===Inserting or Removing People or Objects===
Often not all the people in one picture photograph well, in this instance, with the use of digital cameras and photo editing, two photos can become one and the best individual image of a person in one photograph can be merged with another so that both people, animals or objects look their best.

===Applying Textures===
The software allows a picture in its entirety to be modified. Antiqued or black and white looks can be achieved effortlessly without special film. The photos that the user wants to change can be altered while the rest can be left in their original form, instead of an all or nothing decision.

===Downfalls of Digital camera===
The downfalls of digital camera are that there are no surprises anymore on what the pictures will look like as we can see every photo that is taken right at the moment, whereas before we would take them in and then have to wait with suspense as to what photo's were taken.  Also when the photo is deleted that photo is gone, there is no way to recover that photo.  It takes a lot of batteries to function properly, you always seems to run out at the worst time.  As you can make so much adjustment the person almost seems fake not what was originally there.

===Pixel===
Pixel quality is important for the reason of enlarging photo's and cropping in on a certain objects to make them larger, if the pixel number is not sufficient enough then picture quality can be poor.

===Connecting to the computer===
They now over time have made the software very user friendly so that uploading photo's is fast and efficient.  You can see a video on the computer that you recorded and then uploaded right away, it then is easy to send to friends.  Once in the computer it is very easy to send all photo's to site that other users can enjoy such as  &quot;YouTube&quot;.  Once the photo is on the computer you can send them to a local Photoshop and they will print them and have it ready for you to pick up.

      <comment>/* Data Backup */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Hard Disk also known as the Hard Drive is the device the computer uses to store data on. The hard disk measures about six by four by one and a half inch. The hard drive goes directly in the computer case. It has a IDE or SATA cable that attaches to the motherboard. Also, it has a power supply cable that connects to it directly from the power supply box. The hard disk has the following main parts:
- Read Head
- Write Head
- Platters of Disks
- Actuator Arm
- Power connection
- and The Spindle.

The read head is a laser that reads the platters.
The write head writes data on the platters via magnetizing them.
The Platters is where the actual data is stored. The more platters the hard disk has, the more storage room it is; they are directly related. These disks are usually either from metal, glass, or ceramic.
The Actuator arm is what controls the read/write heads putting them where the data is intended to be on the platter.
The power connection is the part that internally connects the power to the spindle.
The spindle rotates all the disks to help the read/write heads be in the correct place. The faster the spindle can spin the disks, the faster the hard drive can respond to commands; they are directly related.

These days most computers are made with hard drives that hold at least eighty Giga-Bytes. The hard disk is protected and surrounded with a metal case to prevent all outside substances from entering the disk area.

== Data Backup ==

Now that you know how the Hard drive is designed, and how it has weaknesses, it is very important to know that you should periodically back up your data on your hard drive. &quot;Backing up&quot; your data is a term that means to create a duplicate of the data on your hard drive.  This way, if your primary hard drive fails, you won't lose any of your important data, files, music, or contact information. Today, there are also many other ways of backing up data such as cloud computing where your data is stored on a server and can be accessed using the internet.
[[File:Hdd_od_srodka.jpg|thumb|Inside a Hard Drive|right]]


== Data Recovery ==

Data loss is unpredictable and sometimes inevitable. Having data backed up is very helpful. It makes the recovery process a lot less painful. But sometimes you forget to back your data up, so then what? There are specialized data recovery firms like DriveSavers located in California. They take damaged drives apart in a &quot;clean room&quot; (like the ones where computer chips are made) and temporarily repair them so they're able to obtain the desired files. They use the acquired data to reconstruct the information on the damage hard drive. If they are unable to obtain the data they need, their engineers attempt to match the meshed data to appropriate file types to try and reconstruct the original files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">CPU stands for &quot;Central Processing Unit&quot;. It can be thought of as the brain of the computer. In the first personal computers the CPU carried out all the processing. In more modern computers the CPU delegates specialised processes - like graphics handling - to other processors. In the most powerful computers there are more than one CPUs. Super computers can have more than 100,000 CPUs.

The CPU is also called the microprocessor or just the processor.  Intel or Advanced Micro Devices produces most CPUs.  Only recently were high-powered computers able to have multi-core CPUs.  There are dual-core CPUs, which contain two cores; there are also quad-core CPUs, which contain four cores.  There are many benefits to Multi-core CPUs.  To start, they are helping to speed up the processing of a computer while decreasing the heat production.  Multi-core CPUs are also responsible for multitasking, such as burning a cd while browsing the Internet.

[[File:COAST CPU.jpg|thumb|COAST CPU]]

The CPU also consist of a variety of connections and components that are confined together and connected directly to the ''motherboard''. A motherboard provides the electrical connections by which the other components of the system communicate. It also connects the central processing unit and hosts other subsystems and devices. The motherboard is The main circuit board of a computer, located inside the system unit, to which all computer system components connect. ( Understanding Computers 13th edition). Today most personal computers use central processing units (CPU's) manufactured by Inter or Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). CPU manufacturers  include creating CPU's that are as energy efficient as possible, because that would reduce power consumption and increase the battery life of the computer.
Core i7 (quad-core) and AMD Phenom II ( its available in different -core versions) are most commonly used with desktop computers. 
Intel Core 2 and AMD Turion X2  mobile processors, both are design specifically for notebook and tablet computers.

      <comment>/* Structured Programming */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Although there are differences between Structured programming and object oriented programming, they are both useful to programmers.

== Structured Programming ==
* Structured programming takes on the top-to-bottom approach.
* Structured programming is based around data structures and subroutines.
* It splits the tasks into modular forms. This makes the program simpler and easier to read with less lines and codes.
* This type of program accomplishes certain tasks for that of a specific reason.
* For example, invoice printers use structured programming. This type has clear, correct, precise descriptions.
* A structured program is decomposed into a hierarchy of processes. A process in this context is a body of code, typically a function or subroutine, that takes some input and manipulates it to produce an output. A process may be composed of other, more specialized processes, i.e., it may be a function that calls other functions.

== Object Oriented Programming ==
* This type of programming uses sections in a program to perform certain tasks. 
* It splits the program into objects that can be reused into other programs. 
* They are small programs that can be used in other software. 
* Each object or module has the data and the instruction of what to do with the data in it. This can be reused in other software .
* An object-oriented program is decomposed into a network of collaborating objects. An object represents a thing or concept and has a known set of behaviors that may be invoked by other objects. For any activity of the program, an object responsible for that activity may interact with other objects by invoking their behaviors, or &quot;methods&quot;, until the activity is complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are currently a few great products that utilize artificial intelligence for home use.  Many monotonous chores can be replaced by such technologies and give the individual more time to pursue other activities.

==Robot Vacuum==
One such product is the robotic vacuum made by IRobot.  This vacuum will automatically release itself from itself charging craddle and proceed to automatically vacuum your carpet or hardwood floors.  One charge is good for 45min of vacuuming and it will let you know when it needs to be emptied out.  A similar product by the same manufacturer will wash your hardwood floors.  With the use of sensors and infrared tracking beams it will avoid carpets and will cover a 12 foot by 12 foot kitchen in 45 min.  There is also an industrial version of this used in warehouses and industry shops.  Needless to say that this is just a sure sign of great things to come with the implementation of AI being used to make jobs easier. 

==RoboMower®==

RoboMower® is as the name implies. It is a robotic lawn mower that actually does the mowing for you.  The charger station is also set up so that your mower is charged.  This mower comes supplied with a wires and pegs and a charger station.  Set up your charger station to make sure your mower is powered up and ready to go.  Next, you lay the wire and pegs around the perimeter of your lawn.  Sensors in the mower make sure the mower does not but your neighbors lawn as well.  The idea is that the wire sinks into the lawn and becomes unnoticable.  The Romomower crisscrosses the lawn to make sure the whole lawn is as short as you like it.  All you need to do next is set the schedule of operation (which can be rescheduled any time) and let your dog chase it around all summer long (not recommended for safety reasons though).

==Robo pets==
Another application of Artificial Intelligence around the home can be found in the increasing number of &quot;Robo pets&quot; that are being marketed to a market segment in search of a low maintenance relationship. While this sector is still in the earliest stages of development, some of these toys, like Tamagotchis(little egg-shaped virtual pets that require constant care and nurturing in order to be kept alive), have had a great success. Another example is the AIBO dog developed by Sony a few years ago having seeing eyes and stereo ears. It has programmed emotions and can recognize words as it &quot;grows&quot;. Researchers are now trying to develop a pet prototype that would be sensitive to human emotions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== System software ===
System software describes all files and programs that are not indispensable to the operating system functions but extend or guarantee the basic functionality of it to the user. When you install the operating system, the system software is also installed. Some system software may be necessary to ensure that the computer can perform basic functions in order to run other programs, that rely on it. It also can allows the operating system to communicate with the hardware of the computer in a modular way, that can easily be updated and configured to the existing needs. However, the end user does not run most of the system software, it runs in the background.  

The main functions of an operating system are: interfacing with users(translating user instructions), booting the computer, (loading the kernel into the memory, determine and configure the hardware attached to the computer), configuring devices (using device drivers to communicate to computer peripherals), managing and monitoring resources and jobs, file management(organizing and keeping track of files), security (using passwords, firewalls to prevent intrusion). System software should not take up a great deal of the computer's memory in order to run efficiently and should be transparent to the user so that the user need not be aware of what the system software is performing in the background.

Another type of System software is represented by Utility programs having the role of managing and maintaining the computer system. 
They fall into several categories: file management programs (performing file management- file look up, copy, move, rename, delete), search tools (searching files), diagnostic and disk management programs (evaluate, diagnose and repair problems), Uninstall and cleanup utilities (deleting programs and temporary files), File compression programs, back-up and recovery programs, security programs (antivirus, antispyware, firewall).

'''Development Tools'''  

Tools to help with the development of software used with computers have been available for a long time but tools for developing programs for devices that use embedded software which are called device software development tools, have not been available until recently. One example of this type of tool is ''Wind River Workbench'', which is a collection of tools designed to speed up the development of devices that use this programs operating system or version of Linux.

==== Device Drivers ====
Device drivers, commonly just called drivers, are software programs that allow input and output devices to communicate with the rest of the computer system.  Many device drivers come with system software when you buy a computer.  Most new operating systems recognize new hardware devices on their own and automatically install them, but sometimes they require a device driver cd for installation.

Device drivers should be updated periodically.  This can be done through the suppliers website.

Device drivers are very common for printers, scanners, video adapters and sound cards.

===== Zip Drive =====
A Zip drive is a useful asset to your computer as it allows you to back up your work.  It is a little bit larger than the regular A: drive floppy disks and have the ability to hold 100 MB, 250 MB, and now up to 750 MB of data.  They allow you to back up hard disks, information on your computer, and also enable you to transport large files from computer to computer.  They range in reliability and speed in writing the disk and most Zip drives are compatible in drives with the same capacity ability.  Most Zip drives are relatively durable and even come with write protection.  Also, some Zip drives can be accessed only with a password so your information cannot be tampered with.

==== Software libraries ====
{{TODO|Extend}}

==== Other basic utility programs ====
The following utility programs help to maintain your computer and keep the computer running with optimal performance:

'''Uninstall Utility''' -Removing programs that you are not using enables you to free up space on the hard drive. Simply deleting the program’s folder from your hard drive does not ensure that the program will be completely uninstalled since certain parts of the program may still be sitting elsewhere (such as shortcuts on the desktop) and can ultimately slow down your computer.  Removing the programs using an uninstall utility ensures a complete deletion of the program. The uninstall utility may be accessed through the operating system or on the program that is being deleted. 

'''Cleanup Utility''' -Another way to free up precious space on the disk is by using the Cleanup Utility. The Cleanup Utility deletes temporary files, such as files stored during a program installation, files sent to the Recycle Bin and temporary internet files. The registry cleaner deletes unnecessary information in the Windows registry, keeping the computer running efficiently. 

'''Disk defragmenter''' -This program optimizes the hard drive by searching for files stored on the hard drive in fragments and assemble them to be stored in contiguous locations. This will make the hard drive run more efficiently  since files are more organized and can be more efficiently located. 

[[File: Defragmenting disk.gif |thumb|This is a simple animation visually demonstrating the disk defragmenting process]]

'''System Restore''' -System Restore is a very useful tool that allows a user to reset the current computer's system files to what they were at a specific point in the past. This tool is useful because if you ever install a program or a new driver that has an undesired effect on your computer and uninstalling it doesn't fix the problem, then you can simply use the System Restore tool to restore your computer's system files to an earlier date when your computer was functioning properly. 

[[File: Windows XP BSOD.png|thumb|A blue error screen indicates a problem in the computer's system files which can sometimes be solved by using System Restore.]]

==== Network Utility ====
Provides basic tools for troubleshooting network communication problems.

'''PING Utility''' -  One of the more common Network utility available on the more popular Operating Systems is the PING utility for network troubleshooting, this tool is to assess if a receiver (Host) is an integrated part of the Network.  PING (for the sound that was made from sonar when detecting an object) incorporates the ICMP Internet Control Message Protocol, this protocol functions to report problems on the Network.  When experiencing a problem accessing a Host, the PING utility is a good starting point for problem determination.  Performing a ping can assist in determining if the Host is on a local network or the Internet. For example, from the Windows operating system CLI command prompt, type, for example ping 10.10.1.1 which is the IP address of the receiving host.
A successful ping would display a response that will look like this “Reply from 10.10.1.1: bytes = 32 time &lt; 1ms TTL=128”, a failed, ping will return a message like this, “request timed out”.

=== Antivirus ===
[[File:Crystal Clear app antivirus.png|thumb|Crystal Clear app antivirus]]
There are ways to counterattack against these malicious software - if one is well-equipped. Antivirus_Software, anti-spyware, firewalls, and other security programs are available to protect against these attacks.

'''Computer viruses''' are self replicating malicious software programs that can cause damage or perform other harmful acts to a computer system. Other than the virus, there are other security concerns in existence, such various types of ''spyware'' software similar to virus but not self replicating or ''worms'' that have as the only function to open breaches so that the infected machine is accessible from the network.

Though they are intentionally designed not to be destructive and evident in the infected computer system (or a network of computer systems) they can disrupt functions. The objective of the virus and spyware is to profit from the information and resources it takes control.

The term '''Spyware'''  is used for software programs that secretly collect data and/or information, spying on the user's activities, without consent and then send it to an outside party, normally via the user's Internet connection. It can be as innocent as monitoring your web page visits so as to tailor the ads you are bombarded with, to logging keystrokes and all that may entail. The most serious implications of this practice are identity theft, and stealing sensitive information like credit card numbers etc.

Generally, they are installed without knowledge of the user when running other types of software, the most common way is to receive an infected e-mail message with an infected attachment or link to a site that promotes the execution of some other piece of software.

[[File:Captura de pantalla de aMule SVN.png|100px|thumb|A lot of spyware gets onto computers through P2P services, such as this one.]]

Lately, spyware use is happening more and more frequently and aggressively and it can damage your computer, causing it to work improperly or to slow down. ''Stealthware'' is a type of spyware that can deliver ads to your computer at any time, regardless of the activities it is engaged in. ''Browser hijacking'' is the act of spyware changing your browser homepage or other settings.

The worst type of spyware rewrites your computer's main instructions to change your browser settings back to  their hijacked form every time your computer is rebooted, undoing any changes you may have made to your browser settings.

==== Importance of Anti-virus ====
To protect your system from viruses
#It is important to use Antivirus software in preventing these unwanted programs from corrupting your information. 
#Some of these viruses can corrupt your information, and some may overload your memories. In a lot of cases, virus can render your computer inoperable. 
#It is also important to keep your antivirus software up to date as new viruses are created frequently.

There are many Anitvirus software programs available on-line such as Windows Live OneCare which helps protect your computer from many different kinds of threats. This software in particular also helps you back up your important documents in case of emergency and runs regular tune-ups to help your computer run smoothly.

{{TODO|Extend and introduce 3rd party tools that satisfy address the same function}}

==== Norton AntiVirus ====
Norton AntiVirus started in 1990. It is the most popular anti-virus program having over 100 million people worldwide using it.It has many valuable features. These features include detecting, blocking, and removing viruses, worms, and spyware.It also protects email and instant messages. For the computer's safety it will automatically renew your subscription. The current version is Norton AntiVirus 2007.

==== McAfee ====
McAfee is also one of the worlds leading anti-virus programs.  Similar to Norton, McAfee had been industry tested and reports 100% detection.  It also has easy scheduling to keep the software and your computer up to date.  McAfee software also scans e-mails and IM attachments as well as has a very idepth virus database.  After surfing the McAfee site I really enjoyed how they have a section that explains what each of the viruses are and what the do in a language that the common user can understand.  By being able to relate this to the user it allows the user to educate themselves and take action.  On the down side, McAfee's e-mail monitoring creates a popup for every single e-mail outside of the preset limits.  For someone such as myself that receives a lot of mail from unknown senders (some junk and some relevant) this can be a very time consuming chore.  On the plus side, McAfee's price is a little less expensive so if your do not use your computer very much this is the program for you. 

==== Virex ====
Virex is McAfees Macintosh Anti-virus software.  This is very similar to the McAfee anit-virus for the PC with several key differences.  Because of the Mac OS X platform you are able to drag and drop the files that you would like scanned which can really speed up your monitoring.  The Virex interface is different from that of the PC interface it has been designed with the Mac user in mind.  With operating Virex you will find that the program is the same user friendly Mac screen.  As well with drop scan this makes it easy to run extensive searches through individual pieces or individual files.  This can prove to be quite useful when running multimedia editing software where only portions need to be scanned.

===== Free disk utilities software =====
There are many free antivirus programs and windows utilities that are available for use on desktop and laptops I would like to introduce three in particular that are very useful. The first  program you can use is from Piriform.com which is named C cleaner. This software supports Windows 7, Vista and XP also (there is also a version which supports Mac OS X 10.5 or 10.6). This will clean Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Windows Registry cleaner. C cleaner will clean temp files, history, cookies, and the auto complete form history. On Windows it cleans recycle bin, recent documents, and temporary files and again form history.  On the Registry it cleans the unused and old registry history. The next is Auslogic disks defrag can be found on the site auslogic.com. The disks defrag “process reduces the amount of fragmentation's” it will organize storage devices into smaller fragments so to create more space. [[File:Auslogics disk defrag.gif|thumb|Auslogics disk defrag]]  The last software to introduce is Microsoft Security Essentials..   This can be found at the Microsoft.com site. Before you use this software the computer must have be installed with genuine Windows. This software will scan and do updates on scheduled times.  I believe that antivirus software can be useful in keeping your computer running more effectively and free from viruses.

=== Firewall ===
{{TODO|Extend and introduce 3rd party tools that satisfy address the same function}}

==== Zone Labs Security Software ====
Zone Labs is a brand of software which provides Internet security solutions.  It protects PCs from spyware, personal data theft, identification information theft, and of course hackers.  This software is derived from its own research center, which presents us with up-to-date security, anti-spyware and anti-virus information.  It also alerts us of the most recent security threats.  This software allows your computer to still run quickly and smoothly, due to its superior compatibility.  Parents are advised to use this program, as it prevents children from access to inappropriate websites.  While emailing, it is able to quarantine unknown attachments while stopping the spread of it by preventing outbound messages so you don’t send it out to everyone in your address book.  It blocks out those annoying pop-up advertisements so you can surf the web without having to keep closing the boxes.  Also, when you install new programs it will alert you of any dangers there may be.

=== Multipurpose ===
{{TODO|Antivirus, Firewall and eMail spam and scanner. Extend and introduce 3rd party tools that satisfy address the same function}}

Some features may be:
*Detect and automatically removes viruses, Trojan horses, and worms. 
*Checks incoming and outgoing email attachments for viruses. 
*Automatically scans incoming instant message attachments for threats. 
*Checks compressed file archives for viruses.
*Keeps dangerous Internet worms out, blocking them before they infect your system. 
*Automatically downloads updates to protect against new threats.
*Automatically scans for viruses upon completing a download.
*Using smart technology to detect emergent worms and other new threats without waiting for updates.

==== Norton====
When it comes to anti-virus software Norton is the industry leader.  Norton has been given praise for reports of to having 100 percent detection for virus.  Norton easy scheduling scans which make it easy to keep your computer up to date.  Norton does everything from scanning inbound and outbound e-mail to IM attachments.  Essentially it monitors all information going into and out of your computer.  One feature that makes Norton stand out is that in includes an inbound firewall protection. However, all these great features do come at a cost Norton is on the high side of the market and there are many other alternatives for a lower price.  Norton  includes spyware, firewall, security, systemrestore and ghost.  All in all if you are looking for a sure bet with minimual hassel Norton is it.

[[File:Virtual memory.svg|thumb|right|Virtual memory]]
Virtual memory is a management technique used by operating systems. Virtual memory is only not virtual at all, it uses a portion of the computers hard drive appropriated for some functions of RAM if more memory is required to run things than the virtual memory can provide without slowing down. Program and data placed in RAM is divided into fixed-length pages, it depends on the operating system used. Virtual memory allows to use more memory than is physically available on the computer.

Virtual memory is a common part of most operating systems found in desktop computers. Because the  ram on the ordinary computer isn’t enough to run all of the programs that most users need to at the same time, virtual memory is required. Without virtual memory you would not be able to open a web browser and a word processor program at the same time. Virtual memory allows the computer to look at RAM for areas that have not been used recently and copy them onto the hard disk. This frees up enough space in RAM so that the user can load the new program. Since the hard disk space is much cheaper than RAM chips, virtual memory has an economic benefit to it. However, since the read/write speed of a hard drive is much slower than RAM the user may find that there is a performance drop if the computer relies too heavily on the virtual memory. The key for the user is to have enough RAM to handle everything they tend to work on simultaneously so that the only time there seems to be slowness due to virtual memory reliance is when they’re changing tasks only.

An Austrian astronomer named Rudi Albrecht worked at ESO developed a virtual memory system to handle files on tape that were larger than the available memory on his Hewlett Packard 2116 microcomputer (A large computer with one processor and 16 kilobytes of magnetic-core memory).  His contributions helped develop our current technology in regards to virtual memory today. http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1223b Here is a link of Albrecht today in the Data Center at ESO Headquarters in Germany surrounded by a 40 processor core, 138 terabyte storage and 83 gigs of RAM.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conduct a preliminary investigation==
Conducting a preliminary investigation is basically finding out the purpose of the program, to propose alternative solutions, describe costs and benefits and submit a preliminary plan with recommendations. There are 4 steps in this phase, they are, 1) conduct the preliminary analysis 2) propose alternative solutions 3) describe the costs and benefits and 4) submit a preliminary plan.

==Do an analysis of the system==
Doing an analysis of the system is basically to gather data from the old system and see how to make it work in your program. there are 3 steps to phase 2 and they are, 1)Gather data 2)Analyze the data and 3) Write a report.

==Design the system==
The designing a system phase does exactly what it says, it creates the first design of the system. There are also 3 steps to this phase and they are, 1) Do a preliminary design 2) Do a detail design and 3) write a report.

All good system designs must include a cost benefit analysis to determine if the benefits of the new system outweigh the costs of developing and implementing the system.  The costs of the system need to include the entire life-cycle costs (e.g. initial investments plus on-going maintenance).  The benefits include labor and resource savings.  There are also intangible savings, but these are much more difficult to quantify (e.g. better data, better customer support, etc.).  Performing a cost-benefit analysis will help to show decision makers outside of the IT department that the project is warranted and cost-effective.

==Develop the system==
Developing a system phase is the phase where the system analyst gather proper hardware and software to create the system. The three steps for this phase are to 1) develop or acquire the software 2) acquire the hardware and 3) test the system. Testing the system then breaks down into unit testing and system testing.

==Implement the system==
Implementing the system means that you convert the hardware, software and files into a new system and also training the users. There are two steps in this phase, they are, 1) Convert to the new system and 2) Train the users. Before any converting can be done, it has to be tested, to ensure that it could be working properly. After the new system is tested, they can then start to transfer their information to the new one. Converting to the new system breaks down into direct implementation, parallel implementation, phased implementation and pilot implementation. Pilot conversion means that the new system is used at only one location with the organization and nowhere else.  To train the users, there is usually a head trainer who will lead the users and direct them on how to use the system by explaining them how to operate it.  Sometimes it can be done online, in which they will not need an instructor because it can come with a robot or chatterbox.

==Maintain the system==
The final phase, maintaining the system is the phase where all the bugs are ironed out. Any last minute changes happen here so the system can operate at its best.[[File:Broom icon.svg|thumb|left|clean and organize, a broom to illustrate the meaning of having a maintained system ]]
It is also a never ending process.  Like a car, you have to keep the system maintained so it can run smoothly so there will no be any problems.  Sometimes when they maintain a system, it can come with an upgrade, which includes new features to an existing software.  Like how in (Understanding Computers Today and Tomorrow, 497) says, if there is any major change, the organization can develop a new system to replace the current one, thus developing the life cycle. Maintaining the system means to grade the problems occurring if any, and to make it run as smoothly as possible.  You can not run a good system without it running at its best !

==Definition==
According to the authors of '''Using Information Technology''' the six phases can be seen within a life cycle creating a step by step process each following the next.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Graphics Accelerators are a co-processing unit in a computer that is devoted to graphics output. These have become increasingly popular due to the increase in the number of highly detailed graphics contained in many computer games. A graphics accelerator takes on all of the processing necessary for the output of graphics allowing the rest of a computers processing abilities not to be ties up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">VOIP or Voice Over Internet Protocol is in a nutshell your phone via through the computer.  One of the biggest benefits to this is the savings on long distance phone calls.  Because you are accessing the phone through your modem it is essentially costing you about 1 cent a minute.  Even the lowest telephone plan is around 5 cents a minute and to get that you have to be calling late at night.  Another benefit is the mobility, VOIP users can take there phone with them where ever they go.  As long as they have a modem connection they have access to there phone.  Should they be away from the phone for a period of time they have the traditional messaging services available to them.  However, despite these advantages it is worth noting that not everyone has a VOIP phone which can make things a bit of a hassle.  Because VOIP phone have different phone numbers it also means switching your phone number.  If there was ever a power outage you would also find that your VOIP phone useless without power to the modem.  All in all we are seeing what through VOIP what the future has in store for the telephone industry however it is clear that certain advancements need to be made in order for this to become the new norm.

'''Skype''' 

Skype is a type of VoIP that allows you to communicate with others through voice, video and instant messaging.  The nice thing about skype is that communication with other skype users is free of charge which allows for more personal interaction via the internet.  It is versatile in it's ability to transfer files and videoconferencing.  The thing that sets it apart from other VoIP services is that it has a peer to peer and a client based system.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are four steps in the first phase of system analysis and design, in computer programming. The first step is to identify the objective of the organization you are programing for. This includes identifying the objective or problem. This step is called conducting the preliminary analysis.Second you are to determine possible alternatives for the organization to use. This normally requires some research into methods that are and are not suitable for organization. Thirdly; describing the costs and benefits to the organization. Normally you would try to come up with solutions other than replacing the whole program. Finally you submit the preliminary plan. You want this to be a accurate and detailed as possible because the ultimate decision is based on this report.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Data Warehouses are a large and specialized form of a database that is used to store a company's data in a form that can be easily updated and analyzed.  It contains data from transaction data, but it can include data from other sources. It separates analysis workload from transaction workload and enables an organization to consolidate data from several sources. With the advent of the data warehouse the need for heaps of physical records in innumerable filing cabinets largely ceased. No longer to modify physical paper records one by one, or to sort through masses of records to arrive at the data required. Data warehouses can perform all of the complex queries and data mining that a regular database can.

There are several characteristics of data warehousing that were created by William Inmon. These characteristics include: Subject Oriented, Nonvolatile, Integrated, and Time Variant.

Subject Oriented
The way that you analyze data basing off of a subject, such as sales for a company, makes it a subject oriented data warehouse.

Nonvolatile
This characteristic simply means that once data is entered, it shouldn't be changed or removed. This makes sense because this will let you analyze all collected data. 

Integrated
This is similar to subject oriented in the way that it handles subject material, except things such as inconsistencies and name errors must be fixed. This needs to be done so that it can be integrated correctly in the system.

Time Variant
Time variant means that the data warehouse focuses on changes over time, such as from old data to new data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Instant Messaging 

IM has been around for some time now, but started off with people placing their notes and messages on bulletin boards and other online services. 

Features of IM are:

* Instant messages - Send notes back and forth with a friend  
* Chat - Create your own chat room with friends or co-workers 
* Web links - Share links to your favorite Web sites 
* Images - Look at an image stored on your friend's computer 
* Sounds - Play sounds for your friends 
* Files - Share files by sending them directly to your friends 
* Talk - Use the Internet instead of a phone to actually talk with friends 
* Streaming content - Real-time or near-real-time stock quotes and news
(http://www.howstuffworks.com/instant-messaging.htm) Retrieved January 16, 2007

It really kicked off in 1996 when Jewish programmers introduced ICQ. It was one of the first successful IM programs. After that, AOL came out with AIM instant messenger. It is messaging in real time and messages are sent trough internet to any computer you desire. When text messaging started, you were able to see message getting typed in real time. If you needed to make corrections in the text, the other party is able to see what you are doing. Now days the only messages you see is the ones that are sent whenever the typist is done writing. There are many popular IM services like MSN messenger, Meetro, Skype, Yahoo messenger, Gadu-Gadu and Google Talk are just some of them. Now days most popular one is MSN messenger. One of the most important is considered a very safe way to communicate. You still shouldn’t share important or personal information through IM.

'''Downside of Instant Messaging'''

Instant messages create disruptions to work and studying.  Many people, mostly young kids and young adults use instant messenger.  The most frequent users are those who play online video games or spend hours surfing the net (http://www.personal.psu.edu/zev100/IM.pdf).  Instead of concentrating on a homework assignment or contributing productively at work people are spending their time instant messaging. This creates a generation that could become lazy due to low concentration levels.  Not only does instant messaging create a lazy generation it also contributes to a decreased awareness of spelling and grammar (http://www.personal.psu.edu/zev100/IM.pdf).  Instant messengers have created their own type of language made up of acronyms and abbreviations that they loose the smart vocabulary that people use in conversation.  Instant messaging also reduces face to face communication which teaches people how to communicate with body language and facial expressions which is an integral part of communication (http://www.personal.psu.edu/zev100/IM.pdf). A statement can be interpreted in the wrong way therefore offending the receiver.  Lastly instant messaging allows an open forum for children and people to chat with strangers that could be dangerous.  Personal information can be obtained by online chats that could be harmful if in the hands of the wrong person.

Nowadays we drop the use of the telephone to talk to someone and fire up the computer and use Instant Messaging to talk to our family, friends, Co-Workers, etc. Instant messaging is easy to use and is free to download. Some of them include AIM, Windows Live, or Yahoo. Instant Messaging is the long form of using Twitter. With an Instant message you type your thoughts into a box on the screen and it sends your comments over the World Wide Web to the recipients on the other end who is on your buddy list. Some of the features of Instant Messaging include sending ''Emoticons'', different sounds &amp; emotions, colors, fonts, and backgrounds. As long as you are not writing your ideas in all capital letters you’re talking in a polite voice. On the other hand, if you are mad at someone then go right ahead and type it all in capitals which means you is shouting at the person. More of today’s applications such as Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace are merging their friend lists straight into your favorite instant messengers. For several individuals like myself who use a screen reader I love having all of my social networking sites combined into one application where the screen reader is able to pick up the entire conversation to and from the recipient instead of being on the site and picking up half of the conversation.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">MP3 Players are all around us these days. We just need to have music to filter out the silence around us. The growing need for MP3 players have caused them to become more effcient. For instance they keep getting smaller and smaller which makes them more portable. When you break it down theres different sections that should be considered before you purchase a MP3 player. The considerations should be: Data Storage (Hard drive or Flash), smapling rate, transfer of files, battery life, color screens and photo viewing. If your someone like me you need alot of storage room. Therefore you need a bigger storage. Hard drives allow you to go up to enormous sizes. 15, 20, 30, 40 or even 60 gigabyets! however these hard drives can crash then all your music is lost. This is where the flash drive steps in. The flash drive is usually a small card that can in inserted into your MP3 player. It wont go up to the larger sizes you may want, but it wont crash on you either. The sampling rate has to do with the conversions of the song file you have. The number of times that a song can be measured and converted to a digital value is known as the sampling rate. It is measured in kilobits per second. Basically it shows the &quot;quality&quot; of the song. The higher the quality = the higher the sampling rate = the better! Transferring Files is also a consideration. Do you simply just connect the cables and drag and drop? or do you have to install a whole new application on your PC, then select your songs to convert, then send them onto the drive or card of your player? Some new players has been fixed with color screens and photo viewing. This is seen in the new Ipods which allow you to view photo's or even watch movies on the Ipod itself.

==Hard drive based mp3 players==
High capacity player that tends to have more features and larger screens, as well being able to hold all the songs that you can every dream of.  They can range from a couple of Gigs to as much as 80 GB which is currently used by Ipod and the Zune. The hard drives have moving parts, but lot of them have great anti skip capabilities, 10,20 minutes.  Many of the new hard drive based mp3 players come equipped with a colour screen that can display JPEG and BMP images.  Not only can you view pictures on these players, you may be able to watch movies and videos with many of them. Currently some of the best players are Ipod, Zune, and creative and many more. When looking for an mp3 player you want to look for one with the most accessories, this way you can use it more. Make sure to research your player before buying.

==MP3 players less than 20GB==

MP3 players with less than 20GB of memory are unable to store large videos or large quantity of video. Therefore their main purpose is to store and play music. As well it subdivides all the musics into many different categories including:
#Labeled playlists
#alphabetically
#by artist
#by genre
#by album, etc.

As well, mp3 players are able to store other information such as pictures, games, calendars, contacts, etc. When viewing pictures some mp3 players allow the device to work as PowerPoint does making slideshows out of the photographs. It allows the user to apply transitions, music and and timing for each slide or photograph. The players are becoming more intelligent and continue to develop more user functions.

==MP3 add-ons==
Since MP3s have become so popular more devices that allow incorporation into the other aspects of our lives have been introduced. Devices such as car radio adapters, portable speakers and an array of cases have become popular.  
The portable speakers act as a new age stereo system, which hooks up to the mp3 and plays any and all of the music out loud through the speakers. Car adapters attach to the car stereos, through the lighter/power ports and communicates to the radio frequencies allowing the music on the mp3 to play through the speakers in your vehicle. Finally the cases provide protection to the mp3 and also gives your mp3 player personality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Abandoned software ===
Abandoned software on the other hand is software that is no longer available to the public. It's software that is no longer used, provided, nor published by the producers. The users that already have it may continue using it but cannot expand their use for it. If current users attempt to spread it, it is considered illegal. After a quick  search on the web, it is easy to find sites that have abandoned software for download. Better yet, there are even discussion boards posted of where to find the best sites to download what you are looking for. The most popular download of abandoned software is ancient video games such as Atari.


Pirating can also mean using C.D Keys, &quot;via CD copies,&quot; someone else is using and spreading them over the internet. This causes problems with software/products/video games with C.D keys already in use if you play online. No one has ever taken this type of pirating to heart as of yet.

Pirating of software is taken very seriously by those who stand to lose the most such as: larger recording studios, BMG and movie producers i.e.: Disney. Downloads of music videos and software applications are becoming the norm of today's society, there are many sites called torrent sites available with the latest releases of movies and music.this has created a search for higher levels of security to prevent files from being pirated. Manufactures are inventing  more encryption codes on discs to prevent them from being uploaded but they will never work.

Grassroots organizations exist such as the Pirate Party opposing copyright particularly on software. Some campaign for legal reform for various reasons including freedom of ideas. Widespread opposition also exists to software patents.

      <comment>/* Rutherford Scattering */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:15px;&quot;&gt;
The atom as we know it, was not originally known as it is today. As you may know from GCSE physics, the way in which an atom is structured consists of a nucleus and electrons. This isn't far from the truth, but there are some differences in the way in which the atom is laid out. To better understand this, we need to look at how the modern structure of the atom was discovered.

==10.1.1 Constituents of the atom -- &quot;What is the atom made of&quot;==
=== Rutherford Scattering===
[[Image:Plum pudding atom.svg|thumb|left|220px|The original model of the atom -- the &quot;plum pudding&quot;]]
[[Image:Rutherford gold foil experiment results.svg|thumb|right|220px|The original model of the atom at the top, and the Rutherford one.]]

Originally the atom was thought of as a tiny piece of solid matter. People knew that the atom was the smallest thing you could have, the word atom comes from a Greek word meaning indivisible. So if the atom was the smallest thing it seemed perfectly sensible to imagine it as a sort of solid jelly.

Rutherford had a different idea, and to test it he had to make a very thin solid layer. He used gold, because it is easier to roll or hammer out a thin solid layer of gold than any other material. He wanted a thin layer because he wondered if the atoms really were solid.

To test his idea he fired  '''alpha particles''' (usually written as &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particles) at the foil. These particles consist of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, that is they are helium nuclei. They were quite easy to use because a common type of radio-active decay emits &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particles. When this experiment was first performed, by Rutherford's assistants, Geiger and Marsden, in 1909 they found a rather interesting result. Most of the particle went straight through the foil. However, a few of them '''bounced off'''. This behaviour could not be explained if the atoms are really a jelly-like solid.

If we think about this result and consider it at the large scale we can get an idea of what is happening. Imagine we have a wire fence, and let's imagine that it is perfectly strong, and we fire balls at it. Let this fence be the nice open net that we often get with holes about 75mm square. If we fire a football we are not surprised if it just bounces straight off. The football is much bigger than the holes in the fence and so the fence appears to be solid. If we hit golf balls at the fence we'd not be surprised if most went straight through it, and the ones that hit right onto a wire bounced back. If we fired slugs from an air pistol we'd expect even more to go straight through.

This sort of thinking gave Rutherford the idea of the atom.
# He suggested that because most of the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particles went straight through the '''atom must contain a majority of empty space'''.
# Some alpha particles '''scattered''' off so these must have been '''repelled''' by something.
# That something must have a positive charge to repel the positive charge of the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particle and must be heavier than the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-particle to make it '''bounce''' the way that it did.

This gave Rutherford the idea that the atom was mostly empty space, with a heavy, positively charged nucleus with the relatively light, negatively-charged electrons orbiting around it like planets around a star. (Of course, in those days the only star that we knew had planets was our sun.)

=== The now-known structure===
As we know now, the atom contains:
# Nucleons (Protons and Neutrons bundled together)
# Electrons

Now, the things to remember about atoms are that the '''The atom is defined by the number of protons in the nucleus!''', so if there's 1 proton in the nucleus, then it's going to be hydrogen, because its atomic number (number of protons) is 1. If you want to know what the element is, then look it up on the periodic table. Now, for some quick facts:

# The number of electrons in an '''atom''' is equal to the number of protons, due to the charge of 1 proton pulling in 1 electron (in AS anyway)
# When electrons are removed or added to an atom, it becomes an '''ion'''. This is called '''Ionisation'''.
# When there are more or less neutrons in the nucleus, then an atom is an '''Isotope'''.
# Isotopes have the same physical and chemical properties, but the nuclei can be either stable or unstable, for example, C-12 and C-14 both occur in matter but the C-14 isotope is unstable

These are important concepts, as they're the basis of other theories and models that you'll learn later on in the module. Now, remember these definitions.
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:22px;&quot;&gt;
*'''Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different masses due to differing numbers of neutrons in their nucleus'''.

*'''Ions are atoms which have a number of electrons different to the number of protons, resulting in a charge.'''
&lt;/div&gt;

{| style=&quot;font-size:47px;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|style=&quot;font-size:30px;&quot; | A
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;  | X
|-
|style=&quot;font-size:30px;&quot; |Z
|
|}

{| style=&quot;font-size:47px;&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;
|style=&quot;font-size:30px;&quot; | 4
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;  | He
|-
|style=&quot;font-size:30px;&quot; |2
|
|}
To understand what these mean, you need to know what the top value and the bottom value means.. the top value, 
* '''A''' is the '''number of protons AND neutrons''' in the nucleus of the element, known as '''nucleon number'''
* '''Z''' is the '''number of protons''' in the nucleus.. so, therefore...
* &lt;math&gt;A - Z =&lt;/math&gt; number of neutrons.

Now, with that said, you will need to be able to calculate the masses and charges of these particles, and you will need to use their specific values unlike in GCSE. Don't worry, you don't need to remember them as you will '''get them in a data sheet at the front of the exam paper. With that said, it wont hurt to remember them!

{| cellpadding=&quot;20&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot;
|'''Particle'''
|'''Charge'''
|'''Mass'''
|-
|Proton
|&lt;math&gt;1.60 \mathbf{x} 10^{-19}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;1.67 \mathbf{x} 10^{-27}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Neutron
|NONE
|&lt;math&gt;1.67 \mathbf{x} 10^{-27}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Electron
|&lt;math&gt;1.60 \mathbf{x} 10{-19}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;9.11 \mathbf{x} 10{-31}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Practice Questions==
Don't let the wording phase you, and make sure to '''read and understand what answer the question wants, and what part is just explaining something'''. To see the answers, look below.
* An isotope of Plutonium-210 is a radioactive isotope, which emits alpha radiation. Calculate:
:* The number of protons
:* The number of electrons
:* The number of neutrons
* The isotope undergoes an ionisation process which removes 2 electrons from the atom. Calculate the overall charge of the atom.

=== Answers ===
&lt;div style=&quot;font-color: #FFFFFF;&quot;&gt;
# Number of protons= 94, Number of neutrons=116, number of electrons=94
# (2 x 1.60 x10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;) = 3.2 x10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <comment>/* Software licenses */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Software licenses ==
Congratulations, you just bought the coolest new operating system out there.  It’s yours.  But wait, is it yours?  Can you view the source code?  Can you make changes to the code?  Can you install the program on all of your computers and your friends' computers, and any other computer that suits your fancy.  No, you can’t.  That’s because you didn’t really buy the software, you bought a software license.

Software being a non-physical construct is not a scarce resource or intrinsically unique, it can be endlessly replicated. Software licenses are the way authors and copyright owners control their rights over these creations and limit access to them.

A '''software license''' is something that declares rights, conditions and permission to the software it applies to. The rights to use, copy, alter and distribute are the most important. Some may only allow you to install it once on only one computer; while others may allow you a certain amount of installs before prohibiting you anymore. The license is also an agreement that you must make in order to continue the installment.

{{NOTE|EULAs (End User License Agreements) are a specific case of software licenses, that in some regions are open to be disputed if no legislation has specifically legitimized that type of agreement, since the user will only see them after purchasing the software product. It then becomes undefined if that post-purchase license is valid or if the user that refuses the agreement, has the right to have the the value paid returned or even a compensation for the time lost, since the vendor had many avenues to be clear pre-purchase.}}

[[File:Copyright.svg|100px|right|thumb|A Copyright Symbol]]
'''Author and Copyright owner'''&lt;br&gt;
Like in any intellectual property creation the author will retain ownership of all rights to it, unless he was doing work for hire or sells some or all rights to another entity, therefor the author can not be the same entity that the copyright owners.

In relation to licenses one has to consider that users do not buy, or own the product but license its use. Details of the license may vary, but in most cases the software license limits the number of computers upon which you can install the software and the types of changes (if any) you can make to the software.

The rest of this section describes the types of licenses available, as you will see they can grant or limit user rights in many aspects, they can even give you the right to alter and distribute the software.

=== Commercial software ===
Commercial software is developed and sold for profit, software that you can purchase, or license. Normally these come with a single –user license which means that you are only allowed to install and use the software on a single computer. In some cases the software could be installed on a second computer that you own, if allowed by the license. The makers of the program do not really sell you their software, rather they sell you a license so you are a &quot;authorized&quot; user of the software. 

This could be any programs such as Microsoft Word, TurboTax, GarageBand Adobe Photoshop. You are not allowed to view the source code or make any changes to that code.

'''Demo/Trial Version'''&lt;br&gt;
In addition to their full versions, some commercial software is available in a demo or trial version. These versions can be used free of charge and distributed to others but are often missing key features, or will not run after a trial period is over. These programs are not designed to be replacements for the fee-based version and is usually meant to be uninstalled after use.

==== Shareware ====
Shareware software is software that you can obtain for free for a limited trial basis, it is usually also found pre-installed on new computers with commercial operative systems. Should you wish to keep the software after the trial basis, you are required to pay a small fee.  It is unethical to use shareware after the trail period ends.  

Most shareware software is incomplete or functionally limited in some way until you purchase it. It may run for a limited time, for example for one hour only, each time you launch it, or some key features, such as printing, may be disabled. In order to get a full version of that software, the user will need to purchase a registration code which can be done through publisher’s website.If you pay the fee to keep the program you can copy and share it with people, but if they choose to keep the software they must pay the fee as well. Shareware can be less costly than other kinds of  commercial software because it is made by a single programmer and uses a different type of marketing system. You can find different shareware programs on websites that offer different software to download. By using this type of marketing it saves cost of having to advertise or package the programs.

=== Freeware ===
Freeware software is software that the copyright owner permits free utilization. The copyright owner keeps ownership of the software meaning that he is the only that can sell, distribute, or modify it. Freeware does not require any payment. There are no time limits of usage or usage restrictions in the software. Once you install the software, you are free to use it as long as you want. The term 'freeware' was trademarked in the 1980's by Andrew Fluefelman, who was an attorney, computer magazine editor and developer of a popular communications program, &quot;PC-Talk&quot;. Although now, the trademark is abandoned and there term is now 'generic'. Some popular examples of freeware is 'Youtube Downloader 3.3' and 'AVG Antivirus Free 2012'.

{{TODO|Add Andrew Fluefelman to the Timeline. It would be interesting to link it to ad-ware and mention and link software bundles and spyware, for instance the Flash Player is freeware but attempts to install other software. Explain that Web tools are not freeware because they can't be distributed and often are monetized by ads and gathering personal information from users (probably in another section but linked from here). }}

=== Open-source ===
[[File:Opensource.gif|thumb|Open Source Initiative Logo]]
Open Source software is software that can be edited, viewed, and used by any person. It is open in the same manner that Wikipedia is (though Wikipedia is not an example OS software) anyone may come here and use it, learn from it, change, it correct it or improve on what they see. They allow for a wider distribution and a wider amount of input, it is also possible for there two be a number of people who wish to design software to collaborate and though they may not have identical ends they can contribute. The aim of those who contribute to Open Source software, or open source anything for that matter, not only the design but the subsequent dissemination of the knowledge and products of their labor.

Open Source is the certification trade mark of Open Source Initiative (OSI). To be distributed under the OSI trade mark the software has to conform to the following terms:&lt;br&gt;
•Software must be free to distribute, share, modify and possibly improve.&lt;br&gt;
•The program source code must be made available.&lt;br&gt;
•The name of the developer must be announced.&lt;br&gt;
•The license must be technology-neutral and must not restrict any other software.&lt;br&gt;

The Free Software Directory of Open Source contains over 5,000 free software packages. Free user-generated software now includes the most widely used web-server software Apache, database software MySQL, the second most popular desktop operating system Linux, and web browser Firefox and office suite Open Office. 

{{TODO|Explain the distinction about Open Source (its various interpretations) and the right to access the code, alter it and distribute changes&lt;br&gt;
Feel free also to tackle the issue of:&lt;br&gt; 
Free &quot;libre&quot; software is not a license but a software that can be used, studied, and modified without restriction, and which can be copied and redistributed in modified or unmodified form either without restriction, or with minimal restrictions only to ensure that further recipients can also do these things. In practice, for software to be distributed as free software, the human readable form of the program (the &quot;source code&quot;) must be made available to the recipient along with a notice granting the above permissions. The free software movement was launched in 1983 to make these freedoms available to every computer user.
While free software can be very useful, some operating systems will only accept a certain type of software that is considered free. There are different types of free software. Open source is one type of software that is considered free but does not call itself so. In 1998 some people began using the term open source instead of the word free. Open source is now a well known website to go to download many safe free products.}}

=== Public domain software ===
Ownership rights for public domain software have been donated or defaulted to the public.  This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the software free of charge. Programs can be out of copyright simply because their authors (or right owners) intended to share the work with everyone else, releasing them as public domain. The UNIX community has developed a number of such programs over the years.

Programs in the public domain can be used without restriction, even as components of other non public domain programs. When reusing code of public domain software, it is good to understand its history so that you can be sure it really is in the public domain. It can thus be freely used, copied, or altered and licensed because no one owns the rights to restrict its use. Public domain software is the only type in most cases to which no limitations apply.

There are plenty of public domain programs, but these are often confused with several other types of software, called freeware, which can be obtained for free, or shareware, which is usually obtained free but require a fee for use.

'''Software Piracy'''

Software licenses and other means are useful in today's time where we often face the problem of software piracy. Software piracy and digital counterfeiting affect individuals and businesses. Some software companies charge very high prices so people may seek out pirated copies. There are some tools currently being used to curb software piracy such as software anti-piracy tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Online forums are an environment that allows the discussion and sharing ideas. It differs from things like email and instant messaging in that messages are posted for anyone who cares to see and respond to them. There are an almost infinite number of forum topics around, allowing people of any interest no matter how rare to meet and discuss with like minded people. If you cannot find a subject forum that fits you, you may simply start your own.

Most online forums support one of two methods of tracking unread messages: &quot;Full&quot; and &quot;Session&quot;.

There's a simple test that can provide a good guess at whether the forum software supports &quot;Full&quot; unread message tracking:
# Login into the forum.
# Wait for unread messages to appear (unread markers shown). Do not read them.
# Logout from the forum (use &quot;logout&quot; link).
# Login into the forum again.
# Check whether unread markers that you've seen before the logout persisted through the logout/login.

If markers didn't &quot;survive&quot; logout/login, then the forum is most likely using &quot;Session&quot; unread message tracking. If markers did survive, then there's a good chance that forum indeed supports &quot;Full&quot; unread message tracking. Note that you should check unread markers at the topic level as there are at least some examples of using board-level markers to indicate things other than existence of unread topics within.

*Squamous cells not normally present in pancreas, so four theories have been proposed:
**Metaplasia of pancreatic ductal epithelium present during inflammation (eg during pancreatitis)
**Pluripotent progenitor cell capable of differentiating to adeno or squamous undergoes malignant transformation
**Pre-existing adenocarcinoma undergoes transformation to squamous cell
**Aberrant squamous cell undergoes malignant transformation
*Reported incidence between 0.005% (pure squamous) and 2% (adenosquamous) tumors of pancreatic tumors
*61 cases reported in English literature (PMID 16208119)
**Mean age 62 years
**Presenting symptoms: abdominal or back pain, weight loss, anorexia
**Average tumor size 7.8 cm
**Equal distribution between head, body and tail
**Median survival: resected 7 months, non-resectable 3 months
*Given its rarity, it is important to exclude metastatic disease from elsewhere
*Enhances on triphasic contrast CT
*Consider gemcitabine-based chemotherapy

==Adenosquamous carcinoma==
*PMID 10367867, 1999 &amp;mdash; &quot;Adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas.&quot; (Madura JA. Arch Surg. 1999 Jun;134(6):599-603.)
**Retrospective review of 6 patients
**Approximately 4% of all pancreatic neoplasms (only 134 cases reported at the time of publication - 1999)
**Discussion states positive Ca 19-9, ST 439, keratin staining
**Survival = 5.4 +/- 4 months</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints&quot; is pretty self-explanatory.  It means you do not disturb nature while you are out enjoying it.  If you see a pretty rock, leave it there for someone else to enjoy.  If you eat a piece of candy on the trail, don't toss the wrapper — take it with you.

There are a few exception to both these rules.  If you see trash, by all means, take it.  Throw it in the trash when you get to a proper trash receptacle.  Also be aware that footprints are not always harmless.  Many tundra plants that take years to grow can be destroyed by a single footprint.  Stay on the trail.

One of the most important ways people leave their mark on the land is by building a campfire.  For &quot;no trace&quot; camping, bring a camp stove.  Unfortunately, the campfire is one of the primary attractions for many people, so it is not easy to follow this advice.  If your campsite has a fire ring or an existing fire pit, use that.  If it does not and you ''must'' have a campfire, lay a small tarp on the ground and cover it with six to eight inches of mineral sand.  Mineral sand is sand containing no organic material, and can be found on a beach or where a large tree has fallen over and raised a rootwad.  The sand must be piled deep so the heat does not affect the tarp beneath.  Stop putting new fuel on the fire well before you are ready to put it out, and push in the ends of sticks that have not yet burned.  Allow them to burn down to white ash.  When you are ready to leave, douse the fire well, and spread the ashes over a wide area.  Return the sand to the place where you found it and pack up your tarp.

{{Closed|1= Conclusion is &lt;span style=&quot;background:red; color:white&quot;&gt; Closed&lt;/span&gt; as '''Delete'''. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 11:30, 22 December 2006 (UTC)}}

This was marked as a speedy, but given the rationale provided by [[User:Iamunknown]], I think maybe this is worth some discussion:
:''From all searches I did, cannot find any evidence that this is constructed language is documented anywhere else on the Internet. I searched Google using the terms Tsán, Tsán language, Tsán constructed language, and finally Tsán &quot;constructed language. Furthermore, the last edit of the main contributor, 66.135.111.26 (Talk), on 2004-03-23 was to blank the whole page. Only on 2004-04-03 did someone, User:Perl (Talk • Contribs), finally restore it. Given this evidence, I nominate this article for speedy deletion as (1) unverifiable information and (2) a possible original creation.''
--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:33, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

* I recuse myself from the discussion as I originally tagged the article as a candidate for speedy deletion. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 08:10, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
* The top search result was for the Wikibook page.  I can't find any more info about this either.  The author of the book should indicate its origins and provide some references to prove that this isn't original research otherwise '''delete'''. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 19:45, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' I argue that the original author self-deleted the material. Though it is hard to tell given that he is an anonymous IP address :-/ On a smaller note; it is a stub that has been going on for a very long time (almost 9 months) so... thats my second criticism. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:04, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' as it is not verfiable in any way. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:48, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' - while not speedy I agree with [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]]'s conclusion --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:00, 15 December 2006 (UTC)
**Perhaps, move it over to Wikiversity as a linguistics research project, since it seems to be original. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 07:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

We've received a complaint from this user concerning some of your edits. He claims that you've deleted meaningful content, that you've ignored his protests, refused to participate in a discussion on the matter, and that you've even deleted content from his user page. All of these things are no allowed here on wikibooks. Wikibooks is a collaborative environment, and no single users is permitted to excercise ownership or control over the content of a particular page or book. [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] states that users in a dispute must work towards compromise, and that no user can be making unilateral control over the contents of a page or book. 

As much as I would like this to sound friendly, this is a warning, and if this situation doesn't fix itself, you could be banned from wikibooks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

The '''Turnip Moth''' (''Agrotis segetum'') is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is a common European species, but is also present in other parts of the world as a root-feeding pest of both vegetable and cereal crops. The insect is not believed to be present in the United States, where the government has been making efforts to prevent its introduction on imported food crops&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aphis.usda.gov/newsroom/content/2006/05/kopepper.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
This is a very variable species with the forewings ranging from pale buff through to almost black. The paler forms have three dark-bordered stigmata on each forewing. The main distinguishing feature from other ''Agrotis'' species is the very pale hindwings, pure white in the males, pearly grey in the females. The wingspan is 32-42 mm. The grey larva, sometimes tinged with purple, feeds on the roots and lower stems of a huge range of plants (see list below).

==Ecology==
Two broods are produced each year, with the adults flying in May and June and again in August and September (in Britain). The species flies at night and is attracted to light and nectar-rich flowers. The species overwinters as a caterpillar.

I've nominated this page for deletion as it seems to be yet another game guide.  It's not a new page so maybe it's been a candidate for deletion before. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 00:26, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' - It's part of the [[StarCraft]] book. -- [[User:Prod|Prod-You]] 02:47, 11 November 2006 (UTC)
:&lt;s&gt;'''Comment'''&lt;/s&gt; - Hello, I've come back after a long vacation, so I'm not sure if policy has changed yet. IIRC, last time I was here, there was no real policy to be applied to Video Games, either for deletion or for keeping. The Starcraft book also seems to have some recent [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=StarCraft:Evolves&amp;action=history activity], and I would like to see at least the policy and a decent argument against the book before it gets transwikied or deleted, so we can explain it to the authors before they move. I understand that I may have missed the policy discussion (seems kinda de facto now to traswiki to StrategyWiki), but given the work on the Starcraft book on behalf of the authors looks good. The last thing I want here are anonymous users wondering where or why the Starcraft book gone. When a book is deleted, it doesn't save any space on the server anyway, admins can easily restore all the edits and such. So we aren't &quot;wasting&quot; wikibook resources at all. There is no rush, and we should not rush or overshadow the fact that a transwiki may effectivly kill a project if the authors don't want to move to the next site, relearn all the policies, and in some cases, deal with a license change. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 05:41, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

: Just as a note, I've changed my vote to ''' Keep '''. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

: Hmm, I'll just copy/paste my responce to Rakuten06 here, under his post for my reasoning. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:06, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

:'''Delete and Move''' I know that it's part of StarCraft book but why not move to StrategyWiki like other strategy guide books, but you can come talk to me on my talk page to discuss this argument. [[User:Rakuten06|Rakuten06]] 22:52, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
:: I think it is much more appropriate to discuss votes for deletion here &amp;mdash; the VfD page.
:: Also, I think your approach is wrong. Rather than &quot;why not move&quot; I'd propose &quot;why move&quot;. Surely the default isn't to move books, but to let them grow where they are. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:43, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

:'''Transwiki then delete''' - Right now the [[Strategywiki:StarCraft]] guide is somewhat sparse, and adding [[Special:Prefixindex/StarCraft|this book]] would definitely benefit strategywiki. These pages will probably be transwiki'd irrespective of the delete here or not, it's just a matter of when.  However, depending on the policy, if there is nothing against having the guide here, then I see no reason to delete it.  -- [[User:Prod|Prod-You]] 03:41, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

:Well, if StrategyWiki had similar policies or was part of the Wikimedia project, I would agree with you. But it isn't. To edit anything on StrategyWiki, it requires people to register. Additionally, you are asking the authors to not only move the entire book, but to relearn the policies of a different wiki. I'm not saying that StrategyWiki is a bad thing, but it is a different place.

:Ultimately, I feel that leaving Video game guides here is an excellent opportunity for Wikibooks in general. It allows contributors to edit their own projects, learning how to utilize the tools of Mediawiki markup, templates, and the such. Starcraft as a guide is also reasonably complete, not as good as some sites, but better than many of the wikibooks. It gives a reasonably deep view of strategy in Starcraft, going down to even build orders and cloning. The book is easy to follow as well.

:Also, no official policy on wikibooks has been set against video game guides in general. Arguably, they are software manuals, which is allowed in policy.

:Finally, Starcraft itself is one of those rare exceptional games that even if Video Games were removed from this site, I'd argue that Starcraft should stay. Starcraft does have a reasonably large following, and supposedly is very popular in Korea. (at least, this [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6648934043675888354 video] would imply that). I'm not sure how old that video is, but it does show that Starcraft is pretty popular and can be an exception. And according to [[Wikipedia:StarCraft_professional_competition | wikipedia]], it is also reasonably popular, with 2 television channels in Korea dedicated to professional gameplay of Starcraft. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:06, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

:'''Keep''' I find Dragontamer's arguments valid. If the wikibook is educational and interesting it should stay. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 12:43, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Keep'''. There is no formal policy to be invoked when it comes to videogame guides. The guides that we have deleted so far are those guides which have transwikied to other hosts under their own power, and the forks here were no longer needed. As a general comment, the general concensus among the community now is that videogame guides are generally not wanted here, which explains why the guides that have been transwikied have been so readily deleted here. With that in mind, even if this guide is not deleted as a result of this particular discussion, discussions and policy in the future could easily jeopardize this book again (next time without the possibility of keeping it, regardless of the arguments in favor). I would recommend that this book find a better, more permanent home, but I won't vote to delete it now. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:19, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

The '''scale insects''' are small insects of the order [[../Hemiptera/]], generally classified as the superfamily '''Coccoidea'''.  There are over 7,000 species of scale insects, all of which are parasites of plants, feeding on sap drawn directly from the plant's vascular system. 

==Description==
Scale insects vary dramatically in their appearance from very small organisms (1-2 mm) that occur under wax covers (some look like oyster shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5 mm), to creatures covered with mealy wax. Adult female scales are immobile and permanently attached to the plant they have parasitized.  They secrete a waxy coating for defense; this coating causes them to resemble reptilian scales, hence the name.

==Ecology==
Scale insects feed on a wide variety of plants, and many scale species are considered pests.  Some types are economically valuable, such as the cochineal and lac scales.  Scale insects' waxy covering makes them quite resistant to pesticides, which are only effective against the juvenile ''crawler'' stage.  However, scale can be controlled with horticultural oil, which suffocates them, or through biological controls.  Soapy water is also reported to be effective against infestations on houseplants. Female scale insects, unusually for Hemiptera, retain their larval form at sexual maturity (neoteny).  Adult males have wings but never feed and die within a day or two.  The specifics of their reproductive systems vary considerably within the group, including hermaphroditism and seven forms of parthenogenesis.

==Host plants==
Scales feed on a very wide variety of plants, though most of the particular species have fairly narrow host ranges. If the particular scale can be identified, part of the control strategy is to inspect the area for other host plants, since the scale insects do not travel very far.

==Control==

==Routing and Routed Protocols== 
Confusion often arises between &quot;routed protocols&quot; and &quot;routing protocols&quot;. 

=== Routed protocols ===
A ''routed protocol'' is any [[CCNA_Certification/Network_Layer|network layer protocol]] that provides enough information in its network layer address to allow a packet to be forwarded from one host to another host based on the addressing scheme, without knowing the entire path from source to destination. ''Routed protocols'' define the format and use of the fields within a packet. Packets generally are conveyed from end system to end system. Almost all ''network layer'' protocols and those that are layered over them are routable, with [[CCNA_Certification/Network_Layer#Internet_protocol|IP]] being an example. 

[[CCNA_Certification/Data_Link_Layer|Data Link]] protocols such as ''Ethernet'' are necessarily '''non-routable protocols''', since they contain only a link-layer address, which is insufficient for routing: some higher-level protocols based directly on these without the addition of a network layer address, such as 'NetBIOS', are also non-routable.

=== Routing protocols ===
''Routing protocols'' are used in the implementation of routing algorithms to facilitate the exchange of routing information between networks, allowing routers to build routing tables dynamically. 
In some cases, routing protocols can themselves run over routed protocols: for example, [[CCNA_Certification/Routing_Protocols|BGP]] runs over [[CCNA_Certification/Transport_Layer#TCP|TCP]]: care is taken in the implementation of such systems not to create a circular dependency between the routing and routed protocols.

A list of routing protocols can be found in the [[CCNA_Certification/Routing_Protocols#Routing_Protocols|list of routing protocols]].

==== Routing metrics ====
A '''routing metric''' consists of any value used by routing algorithms to determine to choose one route over another. Metrics can take into account such information as bandwidth, delay, hop count, load, MTU, reliability, and cost. The routing table stores only the best possible routes, while [[CCNA_Certification/Routing_Protocols#Link-state_algorithms|link-state]] or topological databases may store all other information as well.

Routers use the feature known as '''administrative distance''' to select the best path when they &quot;know&quot; of two or more different routes to the same destination from two different routing protocols. Administrative distance defines the reliability of a routing protocol. Each routing protocol gets prioritized in order of most to least reliable using an administrative-distance value. A static route has a lower (better) administrative-distance than a route by [[CCNA_Certification/Routing_Protocols/OSPF|OSPF]], which is better than [[CCNA_Certification/Routing_Protocols/RIP|RIP]].

== Classes of routing algorithms ==

====Distance vector algorithms====
'''''Distance vector algorithms''''' use the Bellman-Ford algorithm. This approach assigns a number, the ''cost'', to each of the links between each node in the network. Nodes will send information from point A to point B via the path that results in the lowest ''total cost'' (i.e. the sum of the costs of the links between the nodes used).

The algorithm operates in a very simple manner. When a node first starts, it only knows of its immediate neighbors, and the direct cost involved in reaching them. (This information, the list of destinations, the total cost to each, and the ''next hop'' to send data to get there, makes up the routing table, or ''distance table''.) Each node, on a regular basis, sends to each neighbour its own current idea of the total cost to get to all the destinations it knows of. The neighbouring node(s) examine this information, and compare it to what they already 'know'; anything which represents an improvement on what they already have, they insert in their own routing table(s). Over time, all the nodes in the network will discover the best next hop for all destinations, and the best total cost.

When one of the nodes involved goes down, those nodes which used it as their next hop for certain destinations discard those entries, and create new routing-table information. They then pass this information to all adjacent nodes, which then repeat the process. Eventually all the nodes in the network receive the updated information, and will then discover new paths to all the destinations which they can still &quot;reach&quot;.

===Link-state algorithms===
When applying link-state algorithms, each node uses as its fundamental data a map of the network in the form of a graph. To produce this, each node floods the entire network with information about what other nodes it can connect to, and each node then independently assembles this information into a map. Using this map, each router then independently determines the best route from itself to every other node.

The algorithm used to do this, Dijkstra's algorithm, does this by building another data structure, a tree, with the current node itself as the root, and containing every other node in the network. It starts with a tree containing only itself. Then, one at a time, from the set of nodes which it has not yet added to the tree, it adds the node which has the lowest cost to reach an adjacent node which already appears in the tree. This continues until every node appears in the tree.

This tree then serves to construct the routing table, giving the best next hop, etc., to get from the node itself to any other network.

===Comparison of routing algorithms===
Distance-vector routing protocols are simple and efficient in small networks, and require little, if any management. However, they do not scale well, and have poor convergence properties, which has led to the development of more complex but more scalable [[link-state routing protocol]]s for use in large networks. Distance-vector protocols suffer from the count-to-infinity problem [http://wiki.uni.lu/secan-lab/Count-To-Infinity+Problem.html].

The primary advantage of link-state routing is that it reacts more quickly, and in a bounded amount of time, to connectivity changes. Also, the [[link-state]] packets that are sent over the network are smaller than the packets used in distance-vector routing. Distance-vector routing requires a node's entire routing table to be transmitted, while in link-state routing only information about the node's immediate neighbours are transmitted. Therefore, these packets are small enough that they do not use network resources to any significant degree. The primary disadvantage of link-state routing is that it requires more storage and more computing to run than distance-vector routing.

==Routing Protocols==
Routers talk to one another about the state of the network and of nearby devices.  The protocols they use for to talk to each other, routing protocols, should not be confused with ROUTED protocols like IP and IPX that carry data on the network.

Common routing protocols include RIP, RIPv2, IGRP, EIGRP, IS-IS and BGP. For the CCNA exam you will need to be well versed in RIP, RIPv2, IGRP and EIGRP. You should be aware of IS-IS and BGP, and be able to configure basic OSPF.

Two main types of routing protocols exist - distance vector and link state. A third type known as balanced hybrid (Known now as &quot;'''Advanced Distance Vector'''&quot;) combines features of both link state and distance vector protocols. 

===Examples of Distance Vector routing protocols===
*RIP
*RIPv2
*IGRP
*EIGRP

===Examples of Link State routing protocols===
*OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
*IS-IS

===Examples of Advanced Distance Vector routing protocols===
*EIGRP &quot;Enhance inter Gateway Routing Protocol&quot;

Routers may be configured with static routes, i.e. the network administrator configures the router with information about routes on a network, OR routers may be learn routes dynamically by using a routing protocol.

==Welcome!==
[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let us imagine a hotel with a finite number of rooms, and let us assume that all the rooms are occupied. When a new guest arrives and requests a room, the proprietor apologises, 'Sorry--all the rooms are full.' Now let us imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, and let us assume that again all the rooms are occupied. But this time, when a new guest arrives and asks for a room, the proprietor exclaims, 'But of course!' and shifts the person in room 1 to room 2, the person in room 2 to room 3, the person in room 3 to room 4, and so on... The new guest then moves into room 1, which has now become vacant as a result of these transpositions. But now let us suppose an infinite number of new guests arrive, asking for rooms. 'Certainly, certainly!' says the proprietor, and he proceeds to move the person in room 1 into room 2, the person in room 2 into room 4, the person in room 3 into room 6, the person in room 4 into 8, and so on... . In this way, all the odd-numbered rooms become free, and the infinity of new guests can easily be accommodated in them.

== [[Marketing]] Wikibook Nomination ==

I saw your nomination to feature [[Marketing]]. Not less then a month ago the book was nominated, and nobody voted for it. You can see the old discussion [[Wikibooks:Featured_books/Nominations/Archives/Archive_1#Marketing|HERE]]. If you think you have made improvements to the book you can certainly go forward with the new nomination, otherwise you might want to read some of the criticisms and work to improve the book. 

If you need any help with that, please let me know [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]]. I am happy to assist people who want to write new books, or improve old books. Welcome to wikibooks! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 02:21, 2 May 2007 (UTC)

The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Markets.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add {{tlx|fair use rationale}}; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or [[WB:HELP|ask another Wikibookian]].

See {{UserImages2}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. [[User:MonoBot|MonoBot]] ([[User talk:MonoBot|talk]]) 00:34, 10 March 2008 (UTC)}}

[[Image:MtCleveland ISS013-E-24184.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Cleveland Volcano]] in the [[Aleutian Islands]] of [[Alaska]] photographed from the [[International Space Station]]]]
A '''volcano''' is an opening, or rupture, in a planet's surface or [[Crust (geology)|crust]], which allows hot, molten rock, ash, and gases to escape from below the surface. Volcanic activity involving the [[Extrusive (geology)|extrusion]] of rock tends to form mountains or features like mountains over a period of time.

Volcanoes are generally found where [[tectonic plates]] are pulled apart or come together. A [[mid-oceanic ridge]], for example the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], has examples of volcanoes caused by &quot;[[divergent boundary|divergent tectonic plates]]&quot; pulling apart; the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] has examples of volcanoes caused by &quot;[[convergent boundary|convergent tectonic plates]]&quot; coming together. By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the [[crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] (called &quot;non-hotspot intraplate volcanism&quot;), such as in the [[African Rift Valley]], the Wells Gray-Clearwater Volcanic Field and the [[Rio Grande Rift]] in North America and the European [[Rhine#Geography|Rhine Graben]] with its Eifel volcanoes. 

Volcanoes can be caused by &quot;[[mantle plumes]]&quot;. These so-called &quot;[[hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]&quot; , for example at [[Hawaii]], can occur far from plate boundaries. Hotspot volcanoes are also found elsewhere in the [[solar system]], especially on rocky planets and moons.

==Plate tectonics and hotspots==
[[Image:Spreading_ridges_volcanoes_map-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map showing the divergent plate boundaries (OSR – Oceanic Spreading Ridges) and recent sub aerial volcanoes.]]

===Divergent plate boundaries===
At the [[mid-oceanic ridges]], two [[tectonic plate]]s diverge from one another. New [[oceanic crust]] is being formed by hot molten rock slowly cooling and solidifying. The crust  is very thin at mid-oceanic ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates.  The release of pressure due to the thinning of the crust leads to [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] expansion, and the partial melting of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most [[divergent boundary|divergent plate boundaries]] are at the bottom of the oceans, therefore most volcanic activity is submarine, forming new seafloor. [[Black smoker]]s or deep sea vents are an example of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed, for example, [[Iceland]].

===Convergent plate boundaries===
[[Subduction zones]] are places where two plates, usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate, collide. In this case, the oceanic plate subducts, or submerges under the continental plate forming a deep ocean trench just offshore. The crust is then melted by the heat from the mantle and becomes [[magma]].  This is due to the water content lowering the melting temperature.  The magma created here tends to be very [[viscous]] due to its high [[silica]] content, so often does not reach the surface and cools at depth.  When it does reach the surface, a volcano is formed. Typical examples for this kind of volcano are [[Mount Etna]] and the volcanoes in the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

===Hotspots===
[[Hotspot (geology)|Hotspots]] are not usually located on the ridges of tectonic plates, but above [[mantle plume]]s, where the [[convection]] of [[Earth]]'s [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] creates a column of hot material that rises until it reaches the crust,              which tends to be thinner than in other areas of the [[Earth]]. The temperature of the plume causes the crust to melt and form pipes, which can vent [[magma]]. Because the tectonic plates move whereas the mantle plume remains in the same place, each volcano becomes dormant after a while and a new volcano is then formed as the plate shifts over the hotspot. The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are thought to be formed in such a manner, as well as the [[Snake River Plain]], with the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] being the part of the North American plate currently above the hotspot.

==Volcanic features==
The most  common perception of a volcano is of a [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] mountain, spewing [[lava]] and poisonous [[volcanic gas|gases]] from a [[volcanic crater|crater]] at its summit. This describes just one of many types of volcano, and the features of volcanoes are much more complicated. The structure and behavior of volcanoes depends on a number of factors. Some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by [[lava dome]]s rather than a summit crater, whereas others present [[landscape]] features such as massive [[plateau]]s. Vents that issue volcanic material (lava, which is what magma is called once it has escaped to the surface, and [[volcanic ash|ash]]) and gases (mainly [[Volcano#Effects of volcanoes|steam and magmatic gases]]) can be located anywhere on the landform. Many of these vents give rise to smaller cones such as Pu'u 'Ō'ō on a flank of [[Hawaii]]'s [[Kīlauea]].

Other types of volcano include [[cryovolcano]]es (or ice volcanoes), particularly on some moons of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]] and [[Neptune]]; and [[mud volcano]]es, which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity. Active mud volcanoes tend to involve temperatures much lower than those of [[igneous]] volcanoes, except when a mud volcano is actually a vent of an igneous volcano.

[[Image:Skjaldbreidur Herbst 2004.jpg|left|thumbnail|[[Skjaldbreiður]], a shield volcano whose name means &quot;broad shield&quot;]]
===Shield volcanoes===
''Shield volcanoes'', so named for their broad, shield-like profiles, are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lavas tha can flow a great distance from a vent, but not generally explode catastrophically. The [[Hawaii]]an volcanic chain is a series of shield cones, and they are common in [[Iceland]], as well.

===Lava domes===
''Lava domes'' are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lavas. They are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption (as in [[Mount Saint Helens]]), but can also form independently, as in the case of [[Lassen Peak]]. Like stratovolcanoes, they can produce violent, explosive eruptions, but their lavas generally do not flow far from the originating vent.

===Cinder cones===
''[[Volcanic cone]]s'' or ''[[cinder cone]]s'' result from eruptions that erupt mostly small pieces of [[scoria]] and [[pyroclastics]] (both resemble cinders, hence the name of this volcano type) that build up around the vent. These can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 meters high. Most cinder cones erupt only once. Cinder cones may form as flank vents on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own.  [[Parícutin]] in [[Mexico]] and [[Sunset Crater]] in [[Arizona]] are examples of cinder cones.

[[Image:Mt.Mayon tam3rd.jpg|thumb|left|Mayon Volcano, a stratovolcano]]

===Stratovolcanoes (composite volcano)===
''[[Stratovolcano]]es'' are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the [[stratum|strata]] that give rise to the name. Stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes. Strato/composite volcanoes are made of cinders, ash and lava. The volcanoes are made by another volcano. Cinders and ash pile on top of each other, then lava flows on top and dries and then the process begins again. Classic examples include [[Mt. Fuji]] in Japan, [[Mount Mayon]] in the Philippines, and [[Mount Vesuvius]] and [[Stromboli]] in Italy.

[[Image:Toba zoom.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lake Toba]] volcano created a caldera 100 km long]]

===Supervolcanoes===
''Supervolcano'' is the popular term for a large volcano that usually has a large [[caldera]] and can potentially produce devastation on an enormous, sometimes continental, scale. Such eruptions would be able to cause severe cooling of global temperatures for many years afterwards because of the huge volumes of [[sulfur]] and ash erupted. They are the most dangerous type of volcano. Examples include [[Yellowstone Caldera]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] of western USA, [[Lake Taupo]] in [[New Zealand]] and [[Lake Toba]] in [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. Supervolcanoes are hard to identify centuries later, given the enormous areas they cover. [[Large igneous province]]s are also considered supervolcanoes because of the vast amount of [[basalt]] lava erupted.

[[Image:Nur05018.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pillow lava]] ([[NOAA]])]]

===Submarine volcanoes===
''[[Submarine volcano]]es'' are common features on the ocean floor. Some are active and, in shallow water, disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the surface of the sea. Many others lie at such great depths that the tremendous weight of the water above them prevents the explosive release of steam and gases, although they can be detected by [[hydrophone]]s and discoloration of water because of [[volcanic gas]]es. [[Pumice raft]]s may also appear. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface. Because of the rapid cooling effect of water as compared to air, and increased buoyancy, submarine volcanoes often form rather steep pillars over their volcanic vents as compared to above-surface volcanoes. They may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands. [[Pillow lava]] is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes.

[[Image:Herðubreið-Iceland-2.jpg|thumb|[[Herðubreið]], one of the [[tuya]]s in [[Iceland]] ]]

===Subglacial volcanoes===
''[[Subglacial volcano]]es'' develop underneath [[icecap]]s. They are made up of flat [[lava]] flows atop extensive pillow lavas and [[palagonite]]. When the icecap melts, the lavas on the top collapse leaving a flat-topped mountain. Then, the pillow lavas also collapse, giving an angle of 37.5 degrees {{Fact|date=November 2007}}. These volcanoes are also called [[table mountain (disambiguation)|table mountains]], [[tuya]]s or (uncommonly) mobergs. Very good examples of this type of volcano can be seen in Iceland, however, there are also tuyas in [[British Columbia]]. The origin of the term comes from [[Tuya Butte]], which is one of the several tuyas in the area of the [[Tuya River]] and [[Tuya Range]] in northern British Columbia. Tuya Butte was the first such [[landform]] analyzed and so its name has entered the geological literature for this kind of volcanic formation. The [[Tuya Mountains Provincial Park]] was recently established to protect this unusual landscape, which lies north of [[Tuya Lake]] and south of the [[Jennings River]] near the boundary with the [[Yukon Territory]].

====Antarctica eruption====
In [[January]], [[2008]], the [[British Antarctic Survey]] (Bas) scientists led by Hugh Corr and David Vaughan, reported (in the journal [[Nature Geoscience]]) that 2,200 years ago, a volcano erupted under [[Antarctica]] ice sheet (based on [[airborne]] survey with radar images). The biggest eruption in the last 10,000 years, the volcanic ash was found deposited on the ice surface under the [[Hudson Mountains]], close to [[Pine Island Glacier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7194579.stm  BBC NEWS, Ancient Antarctic eruption noted] ''Nature'' article: [[doi:10.1038/ngeo106]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Erupted material==
===Lava composition===
[[Image:Lava channel overflow.JPG|200px|thumb|Pāhoehoe [[Lava]] flow at [[Hawaii (island)]]. The picture shows few overflows of a main [[lava]] channel.]]
Another way of classifying volcanoes is by the ''composition of material erupted'' ([[lava]]), since this affects the shape of the volcano. Lava can be broadly classified into 4 different compositions (Cas &amp; Wright, 1987):
*If the erupted [[magma]] contains a high percentage (&gt;63%) of [[silica]], the lava is called [[felsic]].
**Felsic lavas (or [[rhyolite]]s) tend to be highly [[viscous]] (not very fluid) and are erupted as domes or short, stubby flows. Viscous lavas tend to form [[stratovolcano]]es or [[lava dome]]s. [[Lassen Peak]] in [[California]] is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome.
**Because siliceous magmas are so viscous, they tend to trap [[volatiles]] (gases) that are present, which cause the magma to erupt catastrophically, eventually forming [[stratovolcano]]es. [[Pyroclastic flow]]s ([[ignimbrite]]s) are highly hazardous products of such volcanoes, since they are composed of molten volcanic ash too heavy to go up into the atmosphere, so they hug the volcano's slopes and travel far from their vents during large eruptions. Temperatures as high as 1,200 °C are known to occur in [[pyroclastic flow]]s, which will incinerate everything flammable in their path and thick layers of hot pyroclastic flow deposits can be laid down, often up to many meters thick. [[Alaska]]'s [[Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes]], formed by the eruption of [[Novarupta]] near [[Katmai]] in 1912, is an example of a thick [[pyroclastic flow]] or [[ignimbrite]] deposit. Volcanic ash that is light enough to be erupted high into the [[Earth's atmosphere]] may travel many kilometres before it falls back to ground as a [[tuff]].
*If the erupted magma contains 52–63% silica, the lava is of ''intermediate'' composition.
**These &quot;[[Andesite|andesitic]]&quot; volcanoes generally only occur above [[subduction zone]]s (e.g. [[Mount Merapi, Central Java|Mount Merapi]] in [[Indonesia]]).
*If the erupted magma contains &lt;52% and &gt;45% silica, the lava is called [[mafic]] (because it contains higher percentages of [[magnesium]] (Mg) and [[iron]] (Fe)) or [[basalt]]ic. These lavas are usually much less viscous than rhyolitic lavas, depending on their eruption [[temperature]]; they also tend to be hotter than felsic lavas. Mafic lavas occur in a wide range of settings:
**At [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, where two oceanic [[Tectonic plate|plate]]s are pulling apart, basaltic lava erupts as [[Lava#Pillow lava|pillows]] to fill the gap;
**[[Shield volcanoes]] (e.g. the [[Hawaiian Islands]], including [[Mauna Loa]] and [[Kilauea]]), on both [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] and [[continental crust]];
**As [[Flood basalt|continental flood basalts]].
*Some erupted magmas contain &lt;=45% silica and produce [[ultramafic]] lava. Ultramafic flows, also known as [[komatiite]]s, are very rare; indeed, very few have been erupted at the Earth's surface since the [[Proterozoic]], when the planet's heat flow was higher. They are (or were) the hottest lavas, and probably more fluid than common mafic lavas.

===Lava texture===
Two types of lava are named according to the [[surface]] texture: 'A'a and pāhoehoe, both words having [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] origins. 'A'a is characterized by a rough, clinkery surface and is what most viscous and hot lava flows look like. However, even basaltic or mafic flows can be erupted as 'a'a flows, particularly if the eruption rate is high and the slope is steep. Pāhoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows. Usually, only mafic flows will erupt as pāhoehoe, since they often erupt at higher temperatures or have the proper chemical make-up to allow them to flow at a higher fluidity.

==Volcanic activity==
[[Image:Volcano q.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Fissure vent|volcanic fissure]] and lava channel.]]
[[Image:Volcano.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Mount St. Helens]] in May 1980, shortly after [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|the eruption of May 18]]]]

A popular way of classifying magmatic volcanoes is by their frequency of eruption, with those that erupt regularly called '''active''', those that have erupted in historical times but are now quiet called '''[[dormant volcano|dormant]]''', and those that have not erupted in historical times called '''extinct'''. However, these popular classifications—extinct in particular—are practically meaningless to scientists. They use classifications which refer to a particular volcano's formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes, which was explained above.

There is no real consensus among volcanologists on how to define an &quot;active&quot; volcano. The lifespan of a volcano can vary from months to several million years, making such a distinction sometimes meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even civilizations. For example, many of Earth's volcanoes have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently showing signs of eruption. Given the long lifespan of such volcanoes, they are very active. By human lifespans, however, they are not. 

Scientists usually consider a volcano to be '''active''' if it is currently erupting or showing signs of unrest, such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions. Many scientists also consider a volcano active if it has erupted in historic time. It is important to note that the span of recorded history differs from region to region; in the [[Mediterranean]], recorded history reaches back more than 3,000 years but in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, it reaches back less than 300 years, and in [[Hawaii]], little more than 200 years. The Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program's definition of 'active' is having erupted within the last 10,000 years.

'''Dormant''' volcanoes are those that are not currently active (as defined above), but could become restless or erupt again. Confusion however, can arise because many volcanoes which scientists consider to be ''active'' are referred to as ''dormant'' by laypersons or in the media.

'''Extinct''' volcanoes are those that scientists consider unlikely to erupt again. Whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine. Since &quot;supervolcano&quot; [[caldera]]s can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years, a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years is likely to be considered dormant instead of extinct. For example, the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] is at least 2 million years old and hasn't erupted violently for approximately 640,000 years, although there has been some minor activity relatively recently, with hydrothermal eruptions less than 10,000 years ago and lava flows about 70,000 years ago. For this reason, scientists do not consider the Yellowstone Caldera extinct. In fact, because the caldera has frequent earthquakes, a very active geothermal system (i.e. the entirety of the geothermal activity found in Yellowstone National Park), and rapid rates of ground uplift, many scientists consider it to be an active volcano.

==Effects of volcanoes==
[[Image:Volcanic injection.svg|thumb|left|Volcanic &quot;injection&quot;]]
[[Image:Mauna Loa atmospheric transmission.png|thumb|Solar radiation reduction from volcanic eruptions]]
[[Image:TOMS SO2 time nov03.png|thumb|Sulfur dioxide emissions by volcanoes.]]
[[Image:SO2 Galapagos 20051101.jpg|thumb|right|Average concentration of sulfur dioxide over the Sierra Negra Volcano ([[Galapagos Islands]]) from October 23–November 1, 2005]]

There are many different kinds of volcanic activity and eruptions: [[phreatic eruptions]] (steam-generated eruptions), explosive eruption of high-[[silica]] [[lava]] (e.g., [[rhyolite]]), effusive eruption of low-silica lava (e.g., [[basalt]]), [[pyroclastic flow]]s, [[lahar]]s (debris flow) and [[carbon dioxide]] emission. All of these activities can pose a hazard to humans. [[Earthquake]]s, [[hot spring]]s, [[fumarole]]s, [[mud pot]]s and [[geyser]]s often accompany volcanic activity.

The concentrations of different [[volcanic gas]]es can vary considerably from one volcano to the next. [[Water vapor]] is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by [[carbon dioxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]]. Other principal volcanic gases include [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], and [[hydrogen fluoride]]. A large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions, for example [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[halocarbon]]s, organic compounds, and volatile metal chlorides.

Large, explosive volcanic eruptions inject water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and [[pumice]]) into the [[stratosphere]] to heights of 16–32 kilometres (10–20 mi) above the Earth's surface. The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine [[sulfate]] [[particulate|aerosols]]. The aerosols increase the Earth's [[albedo]]—its reflection of radiation from the [[Sun]] back into space - and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the [[stratosphere]]. Several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the Earth's surface of up to half a degree (Fahrenheit scale) for periods of one to three years. The sulfate aerosols also promote complex [[chemical]] reactions on their surfaces that alter chlorine and [[nitrogen]] chemical species in the stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric [[chlorine]] levels from [[Haloalkane|chlorofluorocarbon]] pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for [[cirrus cloud]]s and further modify the Earth's [[radiation]] balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly fall to the ground as [[acid rain]]. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of [[carbon]] for biogeochemical cycles.

Gas emissions from volcanoes are a natural contributor to [[acid rain]]. Volcanic activity releases about 130 to 230 [[kilogram#SI multiples|teragrams]] (145 million to 255 million [[short ton]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/VolGas/volgas.html|title=Volcanic Gases and Their Effects|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|format=HTML}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic eruptions may inject [[Particulate|aerosols]] into the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Large injections may cause visual effects such as unusually colorful sunsets and affect global [[climate]] mainly by cooling it. Volcanic eruptions also provide the benefit of adding nutrients to [[soil]] through the [[weathering]] process of volcanic rocks. These fertile soils assist the growth of plants and various crops. Volcanic eruptions can also create new islands, as the magma cools and solidifies upon contact with the water.

==Volcanoes on other planetary bodies==
[[Image:Olympus Mons.jpeg|thumb|[[Olympus Mons]] ([[Latin]], &quot;Mount Olympus&quot;) is the tallest known [[mountain]] in our [[solar system]], located on the [[planet]] [[Mars (planet)|Mars]].]]

The Earth's [[Moon]] has no large volcanoes and no current volcanic activity, although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=M. A. Wieczorek, B. L. Jolliff, A. Khan, M. E. Pritchard, B. P. Weiss, J. G. Williams, L. L. Hood, K. Righter, C. R. Neal, C. K. Shearer, I. S. McCallum, S. Tompkins, B. R. Hawke, C. Peterson, J, J. Gillis, B. Bussey | title=The Constitution and Structure of the Lunar Interior | journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry | year=2006 | volume=60 | issue=1 | pages=221–364 | url=http://rimg.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/extract/60/1/221|accessdate=2006-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Moon does have many volcanic features such as [[lunar mare|maria]] (the darker patches seen on the moon), [[rille]]s and [[lunar dome|domes]].

The planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] has a surface that is 90% [[basalt]], indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=D.L. Bindschadler | year = 1995 | url = http://www.agu.org/journals/rg/rg9504S/95RG00281/index.html | title = Magellan: A new view of Venus' geology and geophysics | publisher = American Geophysical Union | language = English | accessdate = 2006-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning, have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano [[Maat Mons]], in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.

There are several extinct volcanoes on [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include [[Arsia Mons]], [[Ascraeus Mons]], [[Hecates Tholus]], [[Olympus Mons]], and [[Pavonis Mons]]. These volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years,&lt;ref name=&quot;ESAmarsvolcanoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEMLF6D3M5E_0.html|title=Glacial, volcanic and fluvial activity on Mars: latest images |publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|accessdate=2006-08-17|date-2005-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the European ''[[Mars Express]]'' spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars in the recent past as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESAmarsvolcanoes&quot;/&gt;

[[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]'s [[Natural satellite|moon]] [[Io (moon)|Io]] is the most volcanically active object in the solar system because of [[tides|tidal]] interaction with Jupiter. It is covered with volcanoes that erupt [[sulfur]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[silicate]] rock, and as a result, [[Io (moon)|Io]] is constantly being resurfaced. Its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the solar system, with temperatures exceeding 1,800 K (1,500 °C). In February 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the solar system occurred on Io.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/news/archive/eruption/ ''Exceptionally Bright Eruption on lo Rivals Largest in Solar System'', Nov. 13, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the smallest of Jupiter's [[Galilean moon]]s, also appears to have an active volcanic system, except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water, which freezes into ice on the frigid surface. This process is known as [[cryovolcanism]], and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the [[solar system]].

In 1989 the [[Voyager 2]] spacecraft observed [[cryovolcano]]es (ice volcanoes) on [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], a [[Natural satellite|moon]] of [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]], and in 2005 the [[Cassini-Huygens]] probe photographed [[Enceladus (moon)#Cryovolcanism|fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus]], a moon of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/enceladus.asp PPARC, ''Cassini Finds an Atmosphere on Saturn's Moon Enceladus'']&lt;/ref&gt; The ejecta may be composed of [[water]], [[liquid nitrogen]], dust, or [[methane]] compounds. Cassini-Huygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the [[Saturn (planet)|Saturnian]] moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7489 NewScientist, ''Hydrocarbon volcano discovered on Titan'', 8th June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the [[Kuiper Belt Object]] [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]].

==Etymology==
''Volcano'' is thought to derive from [[Vulcano]], a volcanic island in the [[Aeolian Islands]] of [[Italy]] whose name in turn originates from [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the name of a god of [[fire]] in [[Roman mythology]]. The study of volcanoes is called [[volcanology]], sometimes spelled ''vulcanology''. 

The Roman name for the island ''[[Vulcano]]'' has contributed the word for ''volcano'' in most modern European languages.

==In culture==
===Past beliefs===
[[Image:Kircherearthfires.jpg|thumb|right|Kircher's model of the [[Earth]]'s internal fires, from ''Mundus Subterraneus'']]
Many ancient accounts ascribe volcanic eruptions to [[supernatural]] causes, such as the actions of [[deity|god]]s or [[demigod]]s. To the ancient Greeks, volcanoes' capricious power could only be explained as acts of the gods, while 16th/17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler believed they were ducts for the Earth's tears. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;   One early idea counter to this was proposed by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680), who witnessed eruptions of [[Mount Etna]] and [[Stromboli]], then visited the crater of [[Vesuvius]] and published his view of an Earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of [[sulfur]], [[bitumen]] and [[coal]].

Various explanations were proposed for volcano behavior before the modern understanding of the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] structure as a semisolid material was developed. For decades after awareness that compression and [[radioactive]] materials may be heat sources, their contributions were specifically discounted. Volcanic action was often attributed to [[chemical]] reactions and a thin layer of molten rock near the surface.

'''The Holocaust''', also known as '''Ha-Shoah''' (Hebrew: '''השואה'''), '''Khurbn''' (Yiddish: '''חורבן''' or ''Halokaust'', '''האלאקאוסט''') or '''Porajmos''' (Romani, also '''Samudaripen'''), is the name applied to the genocide of minority groups of Europe and North Africa during World War II by Nazi Germany and its collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L Niewyk, ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust,'' Columbia University Press, 2000, p.45: &quot;The Holocaust is commonly defined as the murder of more than 5,000,000 Jews by the Germans in World War II.&quot;  There is a debate among scholars over whether the Holocaust only refers to Jewish victims, or to all groups targeted by the Nazis, or to some subset of those groups.  All scholars agree that other groups were targeted by the Nazis, but not all believe that the victims are part of the Holocaust. This article uses a wide definition of the Holocaust to include all groups systematically targeted by the Nazis.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early elements of the Holocaust include the Kristallnacht pogrom of November 8, 1938 and November 9, 1938 and the T-4 Euthanasia Program, leading to the later use of killing squads and extermination camps in a massive and centrally organized effort to exterminate every possible member of the populations targeted by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.

The Jews of Europe were the most numerous of the victims of the Holocaust in what the Nazis called the &quot;Final Solution of the Jewish Question&quot; (''die Endlösung der Judenfrage'') or  &quot;the cleaning&quot; (''die Reinigung''). It is commonly stated that approximately six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, though estimates by historians using, among other sources, records from the Nazi regime itself, range from five million to seven million.  

Millions of other minority members also perished in the Holocaust. About 220,000 Sinti and Roma were murdered (some estimates are as high as 800,000) &amp;mdash; between a quarter to a half of their European population.  Other groups deemed by the Nazis to be &quot;racially inferior&quot; or &quot;undesirable&quot; included Poles (6 million killed, of whom 3 million were Christian, and the rest Jewish), Serbs (estimates vary between 500,000 and 1.2 million killed, mostly by Croat Ustaše), military prisoners of war and civilians in occupied territories including Russians and other East Slavs,  the mentally or physically disabled, homosexuals, Africans, Jehovah's Witnesses, Communists and political dissidents, trade unionists, Freemasons, Eastern Christians, and Catholic and Protestant clergy, were also persecuted and killed. 

Some scholars do not include the Nazi persecution of all of these groups in the definition of the Holocaust, rather limiting the Holocaust to the genocide of the Jews. However, taking into account all minority groups, the total death toll rises considerably; estimates generally place the total number of Holocaust victims at 9 to 11 million, though some estimates have been as high as 26 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holocaustforgotten.com/non-jewishvictims.htm Holocaust Forgotten] lists 5 million non-Jewish victims of the Holocaust, Niewyk suggests that the broadest definitions of the Holocaust would have as many as 17 million victims.  The 26 million number is given in Service d'Information des Crimes de Guerre: Crimes contre la Personne Humain, Camps de Concentration (Paris, 1946), 197. For details on the number of victims given in the introduction, please see the death toll section.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another group, whose deaths are related to the Holocaust but not always counted in the totals, comprise the thousands who committed suicide rather than face what they feared would be untold suffering ending in death. In 2006, the European Union financed a project to research these victims; despite religious prohibitions against suicide, it is estimated that in Berlin alone, 1,600 Jews killed themselves between 1938 and 1945. 

==Etymology and usage of the term==

The term ''holocaust''  originally derived from the Greek word ''holokauston'', meaning  a &quot;completely (''holos'') burnt (''kaustos'')&quot; sacrificial offering to a god. Since the late 19th century, &quot;holocaust&quot; has primarily been used to refer to disasters or catastrophes. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word was first used to describe Hitler's treatment of the Jews from as early as 1942, though it did not become a standard reference until the 1950s. By the late 1970s, however, the conventional meaning of the word became the Nazi genocide. The term is also used by many in a narrower sense, to refer specifically to the unprecedented destruction of European Jews in particular. Some historians credited Elie Wiesel with giving the term 'Holocaust' its present meaning.'''
The biblical word '''''Shoa''''' (שואה), also spelled '''''Shoah''''' and '''''Sho'ah''''', meaning &quot;calamity&quot; in Hebrew, became the standard Hebrew term for the Holocaust as early as the early 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/Odot/prog/index_before_change_table.asp?gate=0-2 The Holocaust: Definition and Preliminary Discussion],&quot; Yad Vashem (accessed June 8, 2005) And www.berkeleyinternet.com/holocaust/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shoa'' is preferred by many Jews and a growing number of others for a number of reasons, including the potentially theologically offensive nature of the original meaning of the word ''holocaust''.

The word &quot;genocide&quot; was coined during the Holocaust. In 1944, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace published Raphael Lemkin's most important work, entitled ''Axis Rule in Occupied Europe'', in the United States. This book included an extensive legal analysis of German rule in countries occupied by Nazi Germany during the course of World War II, along with the definition of the term ''genocide''.&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Lemkin ''[Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation - Analysis of Government - Proposals for Redress'' [http://www.preventgenocide.org/lemkin/AxisRule1944-1.htm Chapter IX: ''Genocide a new term and new conception for destruction of nations''], (Washington, D.C.:  Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1944), pages 79 - 95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of the Nazi Holocaust==
The Nazi Holocaust had several characteristics that, taken together, distinguish it from other genocides in history.

===Efficiency===
The Holocaust was characterized by the efficient and systematic attempt on an industrial scale to assemble and kill as many people as possible, using all of the resources and technology available to the Nazi state. Germany was, at the time, one of the world's leading nations in terms of technology, industry, infrastructure, research, education, bureaucratic efficiency, and many other fields.

For example, detailed lists of potential victims were made and maintained using Dehomag statistical machinery, and meticulous records of the killings were produced. As prisoners entered the death camps, they were made to surrender all personal property to the Nazis, which was then precisely catalogued and tagged, and for which receipts were issued (the issuing of receipts also helped to lull the victims into a false sense of security, as it made them believe that they would later be reunited with their property and luggage).

In addition, considerable effort was expended over the course of the Holocaust to find increasingly efficient means of killing more people. Early mass murders by German soldiers of thousands of Jews in Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus, by shooting, had caused widespread reports of discomfort and demoralization among the German troops. Commanders had complained to their superiors that the face-to-face killings had a severely negative psychological impact on soldiers. Committed to destroying the Jewish population, the German Nazi government decided to pursue more mechanical methods, beginning with experiments in explosives and poisons.

In his book, ''Russia's War'', British historian Richard Overy describes how the Nazis sought more efficient ways to kill people. In 1941, after occupying Belarus, they used mental patients from asylums as guinea pigs. Initially, they tried shooting them by having them stand one behind the other, so that several people could be killed with one bullet, but it was too slow. Then they tried dynamite, but few were killed and many were left wounded with hands and legs missing, so that the Germans had to finish them off with machine guns. In October 1941, in Mogilev, they tried a ''Gaswagen'' or &quot;gas car&quot;. First, they used a light military car, and it took more than 30 minutes for people to die; then, they used a larger truck exhaust and it took only eight minutes to kill all the people inside.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''Russia's War.'' Penguin Books; 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Image:Hoefletelegram.jpg|right|thumb|left|250px|The Nazis methodically tracked the progress of the Holocaust in thousands of reports and documents.  Pictured is the Höfle Telegram sent to Adolf Eichmann in January, 1943, that reported that 1,274,166 Jews had been killed in the four Aktion Reinhard camps during 1942.]] In the spring of 1942, the Aktion Reinhard camps began operating. Carbon monoxide was used in the gas chambers at Belzec, Sobibór, and Treblinka, whereas Zyklon B was employed at Majdanek and Auschwitz.

The disposal of large numbers of bodies presented a logistical problem as well. Incineration was at first considered infeasible until it was discovered that furnaces could be kept at a high enough temperature to be sustained by the body fat of the bodies alone. With this technicality resolved, the Nazis implemented their plan of mass murder on its full scale. 

Alleged corporate involvement in the Holocaust has created significant controversy in recent years. Rudolf Höß, Auschwitz camp commandant, said that far from having to advertise their slave labour services, the concentration camps were actually approached by various large German businesses, some of which are still in existence. Technology developed by IBM also played a role in the categorization of prisoners, through the use of punched card machines.&lt;ref name=IBM&gt;{{cite book

===Scale===
[[Image:WW2-Holocaust-Europe.png|thumb|200px|left|Major deportation routes to the extermination camps in Europe.]]
The Holocaust was geographically widespread and systematically conducted in virtually all areas of Nazi-occupied territory, where Jews and other victims were targeted in what are now 35 separate European countries, and sent to labor camps in some countries or extermination camp in others. The mass killing was at its worst in Central and Eastern Europe, which had more than 7 million Jews in 1939; about 5 million Jews were killed there, including 3 million in occupied Poland and over 1 million in the Soviet Union. Hundreds of thousands also died in the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Yugoslavia, and Greece. 

Documented evidence suggests that the Nazis planned to carry out their 'final solution' in other regions if they were conquered, such as the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert, ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' Oxford: Oxford UP, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The extermination continued in different parts of Nazi-controlled territory until the end of World War II, only completely ending when the Allies entered Germany itself and forced the Nazis to surrender in May 1945.

===Cruelty===
The Holocaust was carried out without any reprieve even for children or babies, and victims were often tortured before being killed. Nazis carried out deadly medical experiments on prisoners, including children. Dr. Josef Mengele, medical officer at Auschwitz and chief medical officer at Birkenau, was known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; for his medical and eugenical experiments, e.g., trying to change people's eye color by injecting dye into their eyes. Aribert Heim, another doctor who worked at Mauthausen, was known as &quot;Doctor Death&quot;. 

The guards in the concentration camps carried out beatings and acts of torture on a daily basis. For example, some inmates were suspended from poles by ropes tied to their hands behind their backs so that their shoulder joints were pulled out of their sockets. Women were forced into brothels for the SS guards. Russian prisoners of war were used for experiments, such as being immersed in ice water or being put into pressure chambers in which air was evacuated to see how long they would survive as a means to better protect German airmen.

Homosexual men suffered unusually cruel treatment in the concentration camps. They faced persecution not only from German soldiers but also from other prisoners, and many homosexual men were beaten to death. Additionally, homosexuals in forced labor camps routinely received more grueling and dangerous work assignments than other non-Jewish inmates, under the policy of &quot;Extermination Through Work&quot;. German soldiers also were known to use homosexuals for target practice, aiming their weapons at the pink triangles their human targets were forced to wear.

===Children and adult prisoners===
Children under the age of about 12 were generally deemed unfit for work and were therefore immediately taken to the gas chambers. 

Upon having their prisoner ID tattooed on them, older children were sent to work in either a factory, quarry, or some other strenuous and monotonous place of work. Their shifts lasted from 10 to 14 hours. After the day's work was finished, the children were subjected to incredibly long roll calls, during which some even died. This routine continued for what could be months until the prisoners were either sent to the gas chambers or died from malnourishment or exhaustion.

Between the time of registration into the camp and death, prisoners were subjected to a number of demeaning and torturous ordeals. Prisoners were often beaten, whipped, or hung from beams with their hands behind them. This ordeal was done with their feet just inches from the ground. Prisoners were also regularly shot so that the SS could maintain a feeling of control. 

These dreadful ordeals combined to create a miserable experience within the camps. As a result, many inmates embraced or welcomed death. {{fact}}

===Experiments===

At the Auschwitz concentration camp, Dr. Josef Mengele was infamous for carrying out medical experiments on human subjects. These included placing subjects in pressure chambers, testing various drugs on them, freezing them to death, and various other usually fatal traumas. Of particular interest to Mengele were twins, gypsies, dwarves and infants. Beginning in 1943, twins were selected and placed in special barracks.

Almost all of Mengele's experiments were of little scientific value, including attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes, various amputations and other brutal surgeries, and in at least one case attempting to create artificial conjoined twins by sewing the veins of twins together. This operation was not successful and only caused the children's hands to become badly infected.

The full extent of Mengele's work will never be known because the two truckloads of records he sent to Dr. Otmar von Verschuer at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute were destroyed by the latter. Subjects who survived Mengele's experiments were almost always killed after the experiments for dissection.

While Mengele's experiments were the most notorious, his behavior was not an isolated aberration. Other Nazi physicians also engaged in human experimentation at several concentration camps, including Dachau, Buchenwald, Ravensbrück, Sachsenhausen, and Natzweiler concentration camps.

==Victims==


The victims of the Holocaust were generally labeled as &quot;undesirables,&quot;, &quot;asocial element,&quot; and &quot;morally degenerates&quot; that goes hand-in-hand with the Nazi interpretation of the Untermensch. Nazi Untermensch (&quot;sub-human&quot;) included the following.

The victims of the Holocaust were Jews, Poles, Serbs, Russians, Belorussians, Communists, homosexuals, Roma &amp; Sinti (also known as Gypsies), the mentally ill and physically disabled, intelligentsia and political activists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Roman Catholics and Protestant clergy, trade unionists, psychiatric patients, Africans, Asians, enemy nationals, common criminals, prostitutes, beggars, tramps, political dissidents;  people labeled as &quot;enemies of the state,&quot; that included anyone that opposed the Nazi Party's goals and ideals, especially anyone that opposed their stay in power through thorough checks and policing through the Gestapo;  especially a large portion of the country's rich and liberal dissidents, and many who did not belong to the Nazi conceived &quot;Aryan race.&quot; These victims all perished alongside one another in the camps, according to the extensive documentation left behind by the Nazis themselves (written and photographed), eyewitness testimony (by survivors, perpetrators, and bystanders), and the statistical records of the various countries under occupation.

All these operations were made possibly by the SS, Gestapo (secret police) among others.

==Death toll==
[[Image:Gen Eisenhower at death camp report.jpg|thumb|275px|right|General (later US President) Dwight Eisenhower inspecting prisoners' corpses at a liberated concentration camp, 1945]]
The exact number of people killed by the Nazi regime may never be known, but scholars, using a variety of methods of determining the death toll, have generally agreed upon common range of the number of victims. Recently declassified British and Soviet documents have indicated the total may be somewhat higher than previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Davis, &quot;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/abstract/64152996.html?did=64152996&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=May+20%2C+1997&amp;author=DOUGLAS+DAVIS&amp;desc=7+million+died+in+Holocaust 7 million died in Holocaust],&quot; ''Jerusalem Post'', May 20, 1997 (accessed June 8, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the following estimates are considered to be highly reliable. The estimates:

* About 6.0 million Jews, including 3.0–3.5 million Polish Jews&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_holocaust/faqs/answers/faq_3.html How many Jews were murdered in the Holocaust? How do we know? Do we have their names?],&quot; Yad Vashem (accessed June 8, 2005). A detailed breakdown of various estimates of the victims is available from the [http://www1.ushmm.org/research/library/index.php?content=faq/index.php%23topic01-question02 Online Library of the United States Holocaust Museum] (accessed August 10, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1.8 –1.9 million non-Jewish Poles (includes all those killed in executions or those that died in prisons, labor, and concentration camps, as well as civilians killed in the 1939 invasion and the 1944 Warsaw Uprising)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/poles/poles.php?menu=/export/home/www/doc_root/education/foreducators/include/menu.txt&amp;bgcolor=CD9544 Poles: Victims of the Nazi Era] at the US Holocaust Museum&lt;/ref&gt;
* 200,000–800,000 Roma &amp; Sinti (Gypsies)
* 200,000–300,000 people with disabilities
* 80,000–200,000 Freemasons&lt;ref&gt;Freemasons for Dummies, by [http://web.archive.org/20000919233737/members.aol.com/brlodge/whymasons.html Christopher Hodapp], Wiley Publishing Inc., Indianapolis, 2005, p.85, sec. ''Hitler and the Nazi''&lt;/ref&gt;
* 100,000 communists
* 10,000–25,000 homosexual men
* 2,500–5,000 Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;ref&gt;According to the United States Holocaust Museum [http://www.ushmm.org/education/resource/jehovahs/jehovahsw.php?menu=/export/home/www/doc_root/education/foreducators/include/menu.txt&amp;bgcolor=CD9544].&lt;/ref&gt;

Raul Hilberg, in the third edition of his ground-breaking three-volume work, ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', estimates that 5.1 million Jews died during the Holocaust. This figure includes &quot;over 800,000&quot; who died from &quot;Ghettoization and general privation&quot;; 1,400,000 who were killed in &quot;Open-air shootings&quot;; and &quot;up to 2,900,000&quot; who perished in camps. Hilberg estimates the death toll in Poland at &quot;up to 3,000,000&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul. The destruction of the European Jews (Yale Univ. Press, 2003, c1961).&lt;/ref&gt; Hilberg's numbers are generally considered to be a conservative estimate, as they generally include only those deaths for which some records are available, avoiding statistical adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;Yisrael Gutman, Michael Berenbaum, Raul Hilberg, Franciszek Piper, Yehuda Bauer, ''Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp'', Indiana University Press, 1998, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; British historian Martin Gilbert used a similar approach in his ''Atlas of the Holocaust,'' but arrived at a number of 5.75 million Jewish victims, since he estimated higher numbers of Jews killed in Russia and other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin, Atlas of the Holocaust, New York: William Morrow and Company, Inc, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estonia is marked as ''judenfrei'' (&quot;free of Jews&quot;).]]

Lucy S. Dawidowicz used pre-war census figures to estimate that 5.934 million Jews died. Using official census counts may cause an underestimate since many births and deaths were not recorded in small towns and villages. Another reason some consider her estimate too low is that many records were destroyed during the war.  Her listing of deaths by country of origin is available in the article about her book, ''The War Against the Jews''.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Dawidowicz, ''The War Against The Jews, 1933–1945'', New York : Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975 ISBN 0-03-013661-X&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most authoritative German scholars of the Holocaust, Prof. Wolfgang Benz of the Technical University of Berlin, cites between 5.3 and 6.2 million Jews killed in ''Dimension des Volksmords'' (1991), while Yisrael Gutman and Robert Rozett estimate between 5.59 and 5.86 million Jewish victims in the ''Encyclopaedia of the Holocaust'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Benz in Dimension des Volksmords: Die Zahl der Judischen Opfer des Nationalsocialismus (Munich: Deutscher Taschebuch Verlag, 1991).

The following groups of people were also killed by the Nazi regime, but there is little evidence that the Nazis planned to systematically target them for genocide as was the case for the groups above.

* 3.5–6 million other Slavic civilians
* 2.5–4 million Soviet POWs
* 1–1.5 million political dissidents

Additionally, the Ustaša regime, the Nazis' allies in Croatia, conducted its own campaign of mass extermination against the Serbs in the areas which it controlled, resulting in the deaths of 500,000–1.2 million Serbs.

The summary of various sources' estimates on the number of Nazi regime victims is given in Matthew White's online [http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Hitler atlas of 20th century history].

===Searching for records of victims===
Initially after World War II, there were millions of members of families broken up by the war or the Holocaust searching for some record of the fate and/or whereabouts of their missing friends and relatives. These efforts became much less intense as the years went by. More recently, however, there has a been a resurgence of interest by descendants of Holocaust survivors in researching the fates of their lost relatives. Yad Vashem provides a searchable database of three million names, about half of the known direct Jewish victims. Yad Vashem's ''Central Database of Shoah Victims Names'' is searchable over the Internet at [http://www.yadvashem.org yadvashem.org] or in person at the Yad Vashem complex in Israel.

==Execution of the Holocaust==
===Concentration and Labor Camps (1933–1945)===


[[Image:MajorConcentrationCamps.png|thumb|300px|right|Major concentration camps in Europe, 1944.]]

The Nazis were the only political party with paramilitary organisations at their disposal, the SS and the SA, which had perpetrated surprise attacks on the offices and members of other parties throughout the 20s. After the 1932 elections it became clear to the Nazi leaders that they would never be able to secure a majority of the votes and that they would have to rely on other means to gain power. While gradually intensifying the acts of violence to wreak havoc among the opposition leading up to the 1933 elections, the Nazis set up concentration centers within Germany, many of which were established by local authorities, to hold, torture, or kill political prisoners and &quot;undesirables&quot; like outspoken journalists and communists. 

These early prisons—usually basements and storehouses—were eventually consolidated into full-blown, centrally run camps outside of the cities and somewhat removed from the public eye. By 1939, six large concentration camps, located in Nazi-occupied Poland, had been established. After 1939, with the beginning of the Second World War, the concentration camps increasingly became places where the non-political enemies of the Nazis, including Jews and POWs, were either killed or forced to act as slave laborers, and kept undernourished and tortured.

During the War, concentration camps for Jews and other &quot;undesirables&quot; were spread throughout Europe, with new camps being created near centers of dense &quot;undesirable&quot; populations, often focusing on areas with large Jewish, Polish intelligentsia, communist, or Roma and Sinti (Gypsy) populations. Most of the camps were located in the area of General Government in occupied Poland, but there were camps in every country occupied by the Nazis. The transportation of prisoners was often carried out under horrifying conditions using rail freight cars, in which many died before they reached their destination. Concentration camps also existed in Germany itself, and while not specifically designed for systematic extermination, many concentration camp prisoners died because of harsh conditions or were executed.

===Persecution (1938–1941)===
In ''Mein Kampf'', Adolf Hitler writes that Freemasonry has &quot;succumbed&quot; to the Jews and has become an &quot;excellent instrument&quot; to fight for their aims and to use their &quot;strings&quot; to pull the upper strata of society into their alleged designs. He continues, “The general pacifistic paralysis of the national instinct of self-preservation begun by Freemasonry is then transmitted to the masses of society by the Jewish press”.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hitler, ''Mein Kampf'', pages 315 and 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars date the beginning of the Holocaust itself to the anti-Jewish riots of the Night of Broken Glass (&quot;Kristallnacht&quot;) of November 9, 1938, in which Jews were attacked and Jewish property was vandalized across Germany. Approximately 100 Jews were killed, and another 30,000 sent to concentration camps, while over 7,000 Jewish shops and 1,574 synagogues (almost every synagogue in Germany) were damaged or destroyed. Similar events took place in Vienna at the same time.

A number of deadly pogroms by local populations occurred during the Second World War, some with Nazi encouragement, and some spontaneously.  This included the Iaşi pogrom in Romania on June 30, 1941, in which as many 14,000 Jews were allegedly killed by Romanian residents and police, and the Jedwabne pogrom in which between 380 and 1,600 Jews were allegedly killed by local Poles.

The preserved records of the ''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'' (Reich Security Main Office) show the persecution of the Freemasons.&lt;ref&gt; [http://mill-valley.freemasonry.biz/persecution.htm Documented evidence from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum pertaining to the persecution of the Freemasons] accessed 21 May, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; RSHA Amt VII, ''Written Records''—overseen by Professor Franz Six— was responsible for &quot;ideological&quot; tasks, by which was meant the creation of anti-semitic and anti-masonic propaganda. While the number is not accurately known, it is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were exterminated under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dummies&quot;&gt;''Freemasons for Dummies'', [http://web.archive.org/20000919233737/members.aol.com/brlodge/whymasons.html Christopher Hodapp], ISBN 0-7645-9796-5, Hungry Minds Inc, U.S., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Freemasonic Concentration Camp inmates were graded as “political” prisoners, and wore an inverted (point down) ''red triangle''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', volume 2, page 531, citing Katz, ''Jews and Freemasons in Europe''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, a forget-me-not badge—made by the same factory as the Masonic badge, and first used by the Grand Lodge ''Zur Sonne'', in 1926—was chosen for the annual Nazi Party ''Winterhilfswerk''. Winterhilfswerk was a supposed charitable organization, which actually collected money used for rearmament. This coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetloge.de/arst/forgetd.htm Das Vergißmeinnicht-Abzeichen und die Freimaurerei, Die wahre Geschichte] Accessed July 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/bernheim3.html &quot;THE BLUE FORGET-ME-NOT&quot; - ANOTHER SIDE OF THE STORY] Accessed July 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Die Freimaurer-Logen Deutschlands und deren Grosslogen 1737-1972 (Quatuor Coronati Bayreuth, Hamburg 1974).

===Euthanasia (1939–1941)===


The T-4 Euthanasia Program was established to &quot;maintain the genetic purity&quot; of the German population by systematically killing German citizens who were physically deformed, disabled, handicapped, or suffering from mental illness. Between 1939 and 1941, over 200,000 people were killed.

===Ghettos (1940–1945)===

After the invasion of Poland, the Nazis created ghettos to which Jews (and some Roma and Sinti) were confined, until they were eventually shipped to death camps and killed.  The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest, with 380,000 people and the Łódź Ghetto, the second largest, holding about 160,000, but ghettos were instituted in many cities The ghettos were established throughout 1940 and 1941, and were immediately turned into immensely crowded prisons; though the Warsaw Ghetto contained 30% of the population of Warsaw, it occupied only about 2.4% of city's area, averaging 9.2 people per room. From 1940 through 1942, disease (especially typhoid fever) and starvation killed hundreds of thousands of Jews confined in the ghettos. 

On July 19, 1942, Heinrich Himmler ordered the start of the deportations of Jews from the ghettos to the death camps. On July 22, 1942, the deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto inhabitants began; in the next 52 days (until September 12, 1942) about 300,000 people were transported by train to the Treblinka extermination camp from Warsaw alone. Many other ghettos were completely depopulated.  The first ghetto uprising occurred in September 1942 in the small town of Łachwa in southeast Poland.  Though there were armed resistance attempts in the larger ghettos in 1943, such as the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Białystok Ghetto Uprising, in every case they failed against the Nazi military, and the remaining Jews were either slaughtered or sent to the extermination camps.

===Death squads (1941-1943)===

As many as 1.6 million Jews were murdered in open-air shootings by Nazis and their collaborators, especially in 1941 before the establishment of the concentration camps.  During the invasion of the Soviet Union, over 3,000 special killing units (organized into the four ''Einsatzgruppen'') followed the Wehrmacht, conducting mass murders of Poles, Communist officials, and the Jewish population that lived in Soviet territory.  

Poles were an early target in the AB Action, in which 30,000 Polish intellectual and political figures were rounded up, and 7,000 eventually murdered.  By the summer of 1941, the Einsatzgruppen turned to targeting Jews, starting with the extermination of 2,200 Jews in Bialystok on June 27, 1941, and quickly increased in scale. 1,500 Jews were murdered in Kaunas on June 26 by the German SS forces. 4,000 Jews murdered in Lviv on June 30–July 3, 1941 by Ukrainian collaborators.  From September to the end of 1941, a series of mass murders took place throughout Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Latvia: over 33,000 Jews were killed at Babi Yar, 25,000 at Rumbula by Latvian Nazis (Arajs Commando), over 36,000 at Odessa by Romanian forces, 19,000 at the Ninth Fort of Kaunas, and 40,000 (up to 100,000 by 1944) at Paneriai by the German SS forces[http://www.holocaustrevealed.org/_domain/holocaustrevealed.org/lithuania/lithuanian_history.htm]. These, and similar slaughters throughout Europe, murdered around 100,000 Jews per month for five months. By the end of 1943, another 900,000 Jews would be murdered in this manner, but the pace was not fast enough for the Nazi leadership, who, at the end of 1941 and the beginning of 1942, began the implementation of the Final Solution, the complete extermination of the Jews of Europe.

Serbs were victims of an extermination policy of Croat NDH since this Nazi puppet state was formed in 1941. The murders took many forms: burning of live Serbs forced into churches; slaughter of Serbs by small death squads, often numbering only three, called &quot;black threes&quot;, who rampaged by night through villages in which dogs were first poisoned.  The squads filled foiba pits with still-living Serbs, often connected by barbed wire, and practiced extremely cruel methods of torture and execution such as gouging eyes and cutting salted necks. They also nailed guts of slaughtered victims to the roofs. Extermination in Jasenovac camp existed since its onset in 1941, at the time when Germans had not yet started their systematic genocide, and it has appalled even the SS, though soon enough they were organizing systematic extermination in their camps too.

===Extermination camps (1942–1945)===

[[Image:Holocaust-gas-hair.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Empty poison gas canisters and piles of hair in the memorial museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau.]] 

In December 1941, the Nazis opened Chelmno, the first of what would soon be seven extermination camps, dedicated entirely to mass extermination on an industrial scale, as opposed to the labor or concentration camps.  Over three million Jews would die in these extermination camps. The method of killing at these camps was by poison gas (Zyklon B or carbon monoxide), usually in &quot;gas chambers&quot;, although many prisoners were killed in mass shootings and by other means. The bodies of those killed were destroyed in crematoria (except at Sobibór where they were cremated on outdoor pyres), and the ashes buried or scattered.

In 1942, the Nazis began this most destructive phase of the Holocaust, with Aktion Reinhard, opening the extermination camps of Belzec, Sobibór, and Treblinka. More than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the three Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943.  The largest death camp built was Auschwitz-Birkenau, which had both a labor camp (Auschwitz) and an extermination camp (Birkenau); the latter possessing four gas chambers and crematoria. This camp was responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.6 million Jews (including about 438,000 Jews from Hungary in the course of a few months), 75,000 Poles and gay men, and some 19,000 Roma. At the peak of operations, Birkenau's gas chambers killed approximately 8,000 a day. 

Upon arrival in these camps, all valuables were taken from the prisoners, and the women had to have their hair cut off[http://www.kimel.net/belzec.html]. According to a Nazi document, the hair was to be used for the manufacture of stockings[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-20/tgmwc-20-195-08.shtml]. Prisoners were divided into two groups: those too weak for work were immediately executed in gas chambers (which were sometimes disguised as showers) and their bodies burned, while others were first used for slave labor in factories or industrial enterprises located in the camp or nearby. Shoes, stockings, and anything else of value was recycled for use in products to support the war effort, regardless of whether or not a prisoner was sent to death. Some prisoners were forced to work in the collection and disposal of corpses, and to extract gold teeth from the dead.

===Death marches and liberation (1944–1945)===

As the armies of the Allies closed in on the Reich at the end of 1944, the Nazis decided to abandon the extermination camps, moving or destroying evidence of the atrocities they had committed there.  The Nazis marched prisoners, already sick after months or years of violence and starvation, for tens of miles in the snow to train stations; then transported for days at a time without food or shelter in freight trains with open carriages; and forced to march again at the other end to the new camp. Prisoners who lagged behind or fell were shot. The largest and most well known of the death marches took place in January 1945, when the Soviet army advanced on Poland. Nine days before the Soviets arrived at the death camp at Auschwitz, the SS guards marched 60,000 prisoners out of the camp toward Wodzislaw, 56 km (35 mi) away, where they were put on freight trains to other camps. Around 15,000 died on the way.  In total, around 100,000 Jews died during these death marches.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, ''The Oxford Companion to World War II''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1944, the first major Nazi camp, Majdanek, was discovered by the advancing Soviets, who eventually liberated Auschwitz in January 1945. In most of the camps discovered by the Soviets, the prisoners had already been transported away by death marches, leaving only a few thousand prisoners alive.  Concentration camps were also liberated by American and British forces, including Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on April 15, 1945. Some 60,000 prisoners were discovered at the camp, but 10,000 died from disease or malnutrition within a few weeks of liberation.

==Resistance and rescuers==
===Jewish Resistance===


Due to the organization and overwhelming military might of the Nazi German state and its supporters, few Jews and other Holocaust victims were able to resist the killings. There are, however, many cases of attempts at resistance in one form or another, and over a hundred armed Jewish uprisings.

The largest instance of organized Jewish resistance was the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, from April to May of 1943, as the final deportation from the Ghetto to the death camps was about to commence, the ZOB and ZZW fighters rose up against the Nazis. Most of the resistors were killed, but the few who did survive the war are currently residing in Israel. There were also other Ghetto Uprisings, though none were successful against the German military.

There were also major resistance efforts in three of the extermination camps.  In August 1943, an uprising also took place at the Treblinka extermination camp. Many buildings were burnt to the ground, and seventy inmates escaped to freedom, but 1,500 were killed. Gassing operations were interrupted for a month. In October 1943, another uprising took place at Sobibór extermination camp. This uprising was more successful; 11 SS men and a number of Ukrainian guards were killed, and roughly 300 of the 600 inmates in the camp escaped, with about 50 surviving the war. The escape forced the Nazis to close the camp.  On October 7, 1944, the Jewish Sonderkommandos (those prisoners kept separate from the main camp and involved in the operation of the gas chambers and crematoria) at Auschwitz staged an uprising. Female prisoners had smuggled in explosives from a weapons factory, and Crematorium IV was partly destroyed by an explosion. The prisoners then attempted a mass escape, but all 250 were killed soon after.

There were a number of Jewish partisan groups operating in many countries (see Eugenio Calò for the story of a Jewish Italian partisan). Also, Jewish volunteers from the Palestinian Mandate, most famously Hannah Szenes, parachuted into Europe in a failed attempt to organize resistance.

===Resistance of Jehovah's Witnesses===

Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany were persecuted between 1933 and 1945. They were scorned by the name Ernste Bibelforscher (Earnest Bible Students) at that time, because Jehovah's Witnesses would not give allegiance to the Nazi party, and refused to serve in the military, they were detained, put in concentration camps, or imprisoned during the Holocaust.  Unlike Jews, homosexuals and Gypsies, who were persecuted for racial, political and social reasons, Jehovah's Witnesses were persecuted on religious ideological grounds.  The Nazi government gave detained Jehovah's Witnesses the option: if they were to renounce their faith, submit to the state authority, and support the German military, they would be free to leave prison or the camps.  Approximately 12,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps where they were forced to wear a purple triangle that specifically identified them as Jehovah's Witnesses. In the end, about 2,000 of their members who were incarcerated perished under the Nazi system. All lost their employment. Dr. Detlef Garbe Historian and director at the Neuengamme (Hamburg) Memorial stated:  “Taking everything into consideration, it has been established that no other religious movement resisted the pressure to conform to National Socialism with comparable unanimity and steadfastness.”&lt;ref&gt;''Persecution and Resistance of Jehovah's Witnesses During the Nazi-Regime  1933-1945'' ''Social Disinterest, Governmental Disinformation, Renewed Persecution, and Now Manipulation of History?'' p.251 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescuers===

[[Image:Raoul_Wallenberg.jpg|left|thumb|Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg and his colleagues saved as many as 100,000 Hungarian Jews by providing them with diplomatic passes.]]
In three cases, entire countries resisted the deportation of their Jewish population. King Christian X of Denmark and his subjects saved the lives of most of the 7,500 Danish Jews by spiriting them to safety in Sweden via fishing boats in October 1943. Moreover, the Danish government continued to work to protect the few Danish Jews captured by the Nazis. When the Jews returned home at war's end, they found their houses and possessions waiting for them, exactly as they left them. In the second case, the Nazi-allied government of Bulgaria, led by Bogdan Filov, did not deport its 50,000 Jewish citizens, after yielding to pressure from the parliament deputy speaker Dimitar Peshev and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, saving them as well, though Bulgaria did not prevent Germany from deporting Jews to concentration camps from areas in occupied Greece and Macedonia. The government of Finland refused repeated requests from Germany to deport its Finnish Jews to Germany. German requirements for the deportation of Jewish refugees from Norway was largely refused. In Rome, some 4,000 Italian Jews and prisoners of war avoided deportation.  Many of these were hidden in safe houses and evacuated from Italy by a resistance group that was organised by an Irish priest, Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty of the Holy Office.  Once a Vatican ambassador to Egypt, O' Flaherty used his political connections to great effect in helping to secure sanctuary for dispossessed Jews.

Another example of someone who assisted Jews during the Holocaust is Portuguese diplomat Aristides de Sousa Mendes. It was in clear disrespect of the Portuguese state hierarchy that Sousa Mendes issued about 30,000 visas to Jews and other persecuted minorities from Europe. He saved an enormous number of lives, but risked his career for it. In 1941, Portuguese dictator Salazar lost political trust in Sousa Mendes and forced the diplomat to quit his career. He died in poverty in 1954.

Some towns and churches also helped hide Jews and protect others from the Holocaust, such as the French town of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon which sheltered several thousand Jews. Similar individual and family acts of rescue were repeated throughout Europe, as illustrated in the famous cases of Anne Frank, often at great risk to the rescuers. In a few cases, individual diplomats and people of influence, such as Oskar Schindler or Nicholas Winton, protected large numbers of Jews. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, the Italian Giorgio Perlasca, Chinese diplomat Ho Feng Shan and others saved tens of thousands of Jews with fake diplomatic passes.  Chiune Sugihara saved several thousands of Jews by issuing them with Japanese visas against the will of his Nazi-aligned government.

There were also groups, like members of the Polish Żegota organization, that took drastic and dangerous steps to rescue Jews and other potential victims from the Nazis. Witold Pilecki, member of Armia Krajowa (the Polish Home Army), organized a resistance movement in the Auschwitz concentration camp from 1940, and Jan Karski tried to spread word of the Holocaust.

Since 1963, a commission headed by an Israeli Supreme Court justice has been charged with the duty of awarding such people the honorary title Righteous Among the Nations.

==Perpetrators and collaborators==
===Who was directly involved in the mass murder?===
A wide range of German soldiers, officials, and civilians were in some way involved in the Holocaust, from clerks and officials in the government to units of the army, the police, and the SS.  Many ministries, including those of armaments, interior, justice, railroads, and foreign affairs, had substantial roles in orchestrating the Holocaust; similarly, German physicians participated in medical experiments and the T-4 euthanasia program. And, though there was no single military unit in charge of the Holocaust, the SS under Himmler was the closest.  From the SS came the Totenkopfverbände concentration camp guards, the Einsatzgruppen killing squads, and many of the administrative offices behind the Holocaust.  The Wehrmacht, or regular German army, participated directly far less than the SS in the Holocaust (though it did directly take part in the massacre of some Jews in Russia, Serbia, Poland, and Greece), but it supported the Einsatzgruppen, helped form the ghettos, ran prison camps, occasionally provided concentration camp guards, transported prisoners to camps, had experiments performed on prisoners, and used substantial slave labor. 

German police units, all under the control of the Nazis during the war, also directly participated in the Holocaust; for example, Reserve Police Battalion 101, in just over a year, shot 38,000 Jews and deported 45,000 more to the extermination camps.&lt;ref&gt;Donald L Niewyk, ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust,'' Columbia University Press, 200, p 83-87.  For Reserve Police 101 see Browning, Christopher R., Ordinary Men: Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland, New York, Harper Collins, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Even private firms helped in the machinery of the Holocaust. Nazi bankers at the Paris branch of Barclays Bank volunteered the names of their Jewish employees to Nazi authorities, and many of them ended up in the death camps.

====Axis members====

=====Bulgaria=====

Bulgaria, mainly through the influence of the Bulgarian East Orthodox Church, saved all of its own Jewish population from deportation and certain death. However, although civil and military administration for parts of Northern Greece and Macedonia had been turned over to Bulgaria by Germany, Bulgaria did not prevent the deportation by German authorities of the Jews from those territories to the concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Boyadjieff, Christo. ''Saving the Bulgarian Jews in World War II''. excerpted at [http://www.b-info.com/places/Bulgaria/Jewish/Boyadjieff.shtml Salvation of Bulgarian Jews during WW II Collection of Materials] - URL retrieved September 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Fascist Italy=====

In Fascist Italy, a law from 1938 restricted civil liberties of Jews. This effectively reduced the country's Jews to second-class status, though Mussolini never made it official policy to deport Jews to concentration camps. After the fall of Mussolini and his creation, the Italian Social Republic, Jews started being deported to German camps. The deported numbered about 8,369, and only about a thousand survived. Several small camps were built in Italy and the so-called Risiera di San Sabba hosted a crematorium; from 2,000 to 5,000 people were killed in San Sabba, only a few of whom were Jews.

=====Antonescu's Romania=====

The Romanian Antonescu regime was directly responsible for the deaths of between 280,000 and 380,000 Jews. An official report[http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/programs/presentations/2005-03-10/pdf/english/executive_summary.pdf].   released by the Romanian government concluded,  &quot;Of all the allies of Nazi Germany, Romania bears responsibility for the deaths of more Jews than any country other than Germany itself. The exterminations committed in Iasi, Odessa, Bogdanovka, Domanovka, and Peciora, for example, were among the most hideous acts committed against Jews anywhere during the Holocaust.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/index.php?content=programs/presentations/2005-03-10/ Romania: Facing the Past]&quot; available in Romanian and English, published online March, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In cooperation with German Einsatzgruppen and Ukrainian auxiliaries, Romanians killed hundreds of thousands of Jews in Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and Transnistria.  Some of the larger massacres included 54,000 Jews killed in Bogdanovka, a Romanian concentration camp along the Bug River in Transnistria, between 21 and 31 December 1941. Nearly 100,000 Jews were killed in occupied Odessa and over 10,000 were killed in the Iasi pogrom. The Romanians also massacred Jews in the Domanevka and Akhmetchetka concentration camps.

=====Hungary=====

The Hungarian Horthy regime deported 20,000 Jews from annexed Transcarpathian Ukraine in 1941 to Kamianets-Podilskyi in the German-occupied Ukraine, where they were shot by the German Einsatzgruppen detachments. Hungarian army and police units killed several thousand Jews and Serbs in Novi Sad in January 1942. However Horthy resisted German demands for mass deportation of Hungarian Jews, and most survived until October 1944, when the Horthy regime fell from power and was replaced by the Arrow Cross Party led by Ferenc Szálasi.  At this late date in the war, with German defeat appearing very likely, Hungarian police nevertheless participated fully with SS in the roundup of 440,000 Jews for deportation to the extermination camps.  Moreover, 20,000 Budapest Jews were shot by the banks of the Danube by Hungarian forces under the direct orders of The Arrow Cross, the Hungarian version of the German Nazi Party. 70,000 Jews were forced on a death march to Austria&amp;mdash;thousands were shot and thousands more died of starvation and exposure.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://hist.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/jpetropoulos/arrow/holocaust/holocaust.htm The Holocaust in Hungary]&quot; Prof. Jonathan Petropoulos, Claremont McKenna College. See also the [http://www.hdke.hu/en/facts_hungholo.html Hungarian Holocaust Museum], also &lt;/ref&gt;

=====Slovakia=====

Slovakia's Tiso regime deported approximately 70,000 Jews, of whom 65,000 were killed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/auschwitz/40-45/victims/perps.html#kabac Victims and Perpetrators, Michal Kabác: Slovak Hlinka Guard],&quot; PBS (accessed June 8, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====European collaborationist countries====

In addition to the direct involvement of Nazi forces, collaborationist European countries helped the Nazis in the Holocaust. Collaboration took the form of either rounding up of the local Jews for deportation to the German extermination camps or a direct participation in the killings.

=====Vichy France=====

In France, Philippe Pétain, who became premier after Paris had fallen to the German Army, arranged the surrender to Germany. He then became the head of the Vichy government, which collaborated with Nazism, claiming that it would soften the hardships of occupation. Opposition to the German occupation of northern France and the collaborationist Vichy government was left to the French Resistance within France and the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle outside of France. The police, the Milice (&quot;militia&quot;, which worked as the Gestapo's aid), as well as members of Jacques Doriot's Parti Populaire Français (PPF) rounded up 75,000 Jews for deportation to concentration camps. The Vichy regime attracted all of the far-right counterrevolutionary sectors of French society, monarchists and other pseudo-fascist movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remond&quot;&gt; See René Rémond's classic study on &quot;The Right [wings] in France&quot; (''Les Droites en France''), and also Zeev Sternhell's arguments according to which fascism was invented in France at the early 20th century, before being adopted and transformed into a popular movement in Italy. French historians, such as Pierre Milza and Serge Bernstein, have argued that there was no &quot;French fascism&quot;, because although some groups, such as the PPF and others, adopted fascist and even Nazi postures, fascism never became really popular. Against Sternhell, they argue that fascism cannot be reduced to an intellectual movement, and must necessarily be considered in its mass dimension. &lt;/ref&gt; ''La Cagoule'', a terrorist group and Eugène Schueller, the founder of L'Oréal, are examples of such groups. Antisemitism, as the Dreyfus Affair had shown at the end of the 19th century, was widespread in France, especially among anti-republican synpathizers. The Vichy government eagerly participated in the Holocaust, for example with the July 16, 1942 ''rafle du Vel'd'Hiv'', in which 12,884 Jews were arrested, including 4,051 children which the German authorities had not asked for. They were all sent to Drancy transit camp anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remond&quot;/&gt; 

Klaus Barbie, &quot;the Butcher of Lyon&quot;, captured and deported 44 Jewish children hidden in the village of Izieu, killed Resistance leader Jean Moulin, and was in total responsible for the deportation of 7,500 people, 4,342 murders, and the arrest and torture of 14,311 resistance fighters were in some way attributed to his actions or commands. 

Maurice Papon was the number two official in the Bordeaux region and supervisor of its &quot;Service for Jewish Questions&quot;. In 1997, following revelations from ''Le Canard Enchaîné'' newspaper, he was finally charged with complicity of crimes against humanity. Papon was accused of ordering the arrest and deportation of 1,560 Jews, including children and the elderly, between 1942 and 1944; most of his victims were sent to Auschwitz. As during Adolf Eichmann's trial, one of the main issue was to determine to what extent an individual should be held responsible in a chain of responsibility. In 1998, he was given a ten-year prison term. However, he was released on grounds of poor health in 2002. Many people thought both the relatively light sentence and his release were scandalous, especially when it was known to all that following the war, Papon went on to enjoy a civil service career, which led him to be the chief of the Paris police, held by historian Luc Einaudi as being directly responsible for the 1961 Paris massacre during the Algerian War (1954–62); Papon even became budget minister of president Valéry Giscard d'Estaing in the 1970s. He was finally arrested because of the ''Canard Enchaîné'' 's revelations, which themselves followed a fiscal control ordered by Papon with the aim of intimidating the satirical newspaper.

=====Ustaše's Croatia=====

The Croatian Ustaše regime killed hundreds of thousands of Serbs (estimates vary widely, but by all sources more than 330,000–390,000, and possibly well over a million), over 20,000 Jews and 26,000 Roma, primarily in the Ustase's Jasenovac concentration camp near Zagreb. The Ustase also deported 7,000 more Jews to Nazi extermination camps.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Jasenovac.html Jasenovac]&quot; at the Jewish Virtual Library &lt;/ref&gt;
Croats were also victims of the Nazi regime and those who opposed it ended in concentration camps. Many Croats risked their lives during the Holocaust in order to save Jews from extermination by the Nazis (Croatian Righteous Among the Nations).

=====Serbia=====

Serbia was set up as a Nazi puppet state under Serbian army general Milan Nedić, which was known as Nedić's Serbia. The internal affairs of the Serbian puppet state were moderated by German racial laws, that were introduced in all occupied territories with immediate effects on Jews, Roma people, as well as imprisonment of left oriented persons. The two major concentration camps in Serbia were: Sajmište  and Banjica. Of 40,000 Serbian Jews around one half lost their lives in Nazi concentration camps both in Serbia and German Reich, where most of the captured Serbian Jews were transferred. Under Nedić, Belgrade was declared to be Judenfrei in 1942. Serbs were also victims of the Nazi regime, and most of the victims in Banjica were Serbian. Nazis had a policy of killing 100 Serbs for each killed German soldier and 50 killed Serbs for each wounded, resulting in widespread taking of hostages and executions such as Kragujevac massacre. Despite these repressive measures, Serbs rebelled, and most Serbs saw Jews as their fellow victims in World War II, dying together in Nazi repression and genocide in Sajmište, Banjica and [asenovac. Legends about Serbs saving the Jews in WWII are widespread in Serbia, and 152 Serbs have been honored as righteous Gentiles.

=====Greece=====

The Jews of Greece mainly lived in the area around Thessaloniki, where there had been occasional conflicts between Jews and Greeks. In Thessaloniki there had been an anti-Semitic nationalist party called National Union of Greece (Ethniki Enosis Ellados, EEE), which was revived by Nazi authorities in the city. Members of the EEE assisted occupying forces to identify Jews and collaborated on the deportation of local Jews with remarkable efficiency, either for ethnic hatred or for more prosaic reasons such as obtaining profits. By the time of the German withdrawal from Greece in 1944, nearly 90% of the Jewish community in Thessaloniki had been annihilated.

Athenian Jews, on the other hand, went through a different experience. They were a minor part of the city's population and in the city there had not been an anti-Semitic atmosphere, and most Jews eluded deportation by either being helped by Greeks into hiding or joining the Greek Resistance in the mountains. This, however, did not exempt Athenian Jews from organized crime against them. Just like the Nazi authorities had restored the EEE in Thessaloniki, in Athens the German occupation authorities created the ESPO (Ethniko-Socialistike Patriotike Organosis), whose members attacked or assisted Germans to locate local Jews. The ESPO's most notorious action was the ransacking the synagogue on Melidoni Street, Athens. Other ESPO members were recruited as guards in the Haïdari internment camp, just outside Athens.

In any case, the three quisling governments headed by Georgios Tsolakoglou, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos and Ioannis Rallis to different extents were unable to stop (or participated) in the deportation or prosecution of Greek Jews. Rallis, for instance, was known to hold the point of view that the houses left by deported Jews in Thessaloniki would be very welcome for the Greek Pontian refugees who came to Greece after the 1922 Asia Minor catastrophe.

=====German-occupied Soviet territories=====

In the German-occupied Soviet territories, local Nazi collaborationist units represented over 80% of the available German forces providing a total of nearly 450,000 personnel organised in so-called &quot;Schutzmannschaften&quot; formations. Practically all of these units participated in the round-ups and mass-shootings. The overwhelming majority were recruited in the western Ukraine and the Baltic region, areas recently occupied by the Soviets for which the Jews were typically scapegoated, which exacerbated pre-Nazi anti-Semitic attitudes. Thus, for instance, Ukrainian nationalists killed 4,000 Lviv Jews in July 1941, and an additional 2,000 in late July 1941 during the so-called Petliura Days pogrom. Nazi Einsatzgruppen, together with Ukrainian auxiliary units, killed 33,000 Kievan Jews in Babi Yar in September 1941. Ukrainian auxiliaries participated in a number of killings of Jews, among them in Romanian concentration camps in Bogdanovka and in Latvia.

=====Norway=====

After Norway was invaded, the Nazis took control of the government and the true government went into exile. Power was given to the German Reichskommisioner Josef Terboven and the Norwegian Fascist leader Vidkun Quisling.  Quisling had attempted to establish himself as the leader of occupied Norway, but the Nazis only used him as leader of a puppet government.  The Nazis, as well as some Norwegian police units, rounded up 750 Jews.  However, the Nazis and their collaborators were very unpopular in Norway, causing a strong resistance movement, so the German government's aims for Norway were never fulfilled.  Many Jews and other people were saved by the actions of Norwegians, including Norwegian police.  Still, detailed lists of Jews (and presumably most other persons as well) existed at the time of the occupation.  This caused the rounding-up of Jews in Norway to be much more efficient than in similar countries (like Denmark).  Quisling and other Norwegians, who collaborated with the Nazis, were executed as traitors after the war.

Also, 245 Sinti and Roma were deported to the Nazi extermination camps, of whom 190 were murdered.

=====Baltic collaborators=====

Some Lithuanian and Latvian auxiliary military units (''Schutzmannschaft'') with Nazi Einsatzgruppen detachments participated in the extermination of the Jewish population in their countries, as well as assisting the Nazis elsewhere, such as deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto. The Arajs Commando, a Latvian volunteer police unit, for example, shot 26,000 Latvian Jews, at various locations after they had been brutally rounded-up for this purpose by the regular police and auxiliaries, and was responsible for assisting in the killing of 60,000 more Jews.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://vip.latnet.lv/LPRA/EZERG_intr.html The Holocaust in Latvia]: An introduction&quot; by Andrew Ezergailis, book excerpt, The Historical Institute of Latvia, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 75% of Estonia's Jewish community, aware of the fate that otherwise awaited them, managed to escape to the Soviet Union; virtually all the remainder (between 950 and 1,000 people) were killed by Einsatzgruppe A and local collaborators before the end of 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Max Jakobson Commission Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity, &quot;[http://www.historycommission.ee/temp/conclusions.htm#crimiger1] Report&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====European occupied countries====
=====The Netherlands=====

Of the 140,000 Dutch Jews, the German occupiers deported about 107,000 of which  101,800 were murdered. This death toll of 73% is the highest in Western Europe. Reasons that have been suggested to explain this phenomenon are: the occupation regime in the Netherlands was formed by fanatic Austrian Nazis; the degree of efficiency and the high level of administrative organization of the pre-war Dutch civilian administration; the typical Dutch landscape without mountains or woods made it practically impossible to find shelter; the majority of the Dutch Jews lived in the larger cities and thus they formed relatively easy targets for persecution and segregation; the Jewish leaders chose, &quot;in order to prevent worse&quot;, a policy of collaboration with the Nazis; the Dutch pre-war society can be characterized as a conglomerate of different groups, which lived separately from another and this fact made it easy for the Germans to segregate and persecute the Jewish section of society; because the Jews were cut off from public life, they lost almost all of the support that could have been provided by other groups in society; active assistance by Dutch collaborators, such as the Henneicke Column group that hunted and &quot;delivered&quot; 8,000 to 9,000 Jews for deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Ad van Liempt, ''[http://www.nlpvf.nl/Book/NLPVF_BooktxtDB.php?Book=84 A Price on Their Heads, Kopgeld, Dutch bounty hunters in search of Jews, 1943]'',  NLPVF (accessed June 8, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; All of these circumstances made it relatively easy for the SS, regularly aided by Dutch police officers, to round up the Jewish population.

===Who authorized the killings?===
Hitler authorized the mass killing of those labelled by the Nazis as &quot;undesirables&quot; in the T-4 Euthanasia Program. Hitler encouraged the killings of the Jews of Eastern Europe by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' death squads in a speech in July, 1941, though he almost certainly approved the mass shootings earlier.  A mass of evidence suggests that sometime in the fall of 1941, Himmler and Hitler agreed in principle on the complete mass extermination of the Jews of Europe by gassing, with Hitler explicitly ordering the &quot;annihilation of the Jews&quot; in a speech on December 12, 1941.  To make for smoother intra-governmental cooperation in the implementation of this &quot;Final Solution&quot; to the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;, the Wannsee conference was held near Berlin on January 20, 1942, with the participation of fifteen senior officials, led by Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Eichmann, the records of which provide the best evidence of the central planning of the Holocaust. Just five weeks later on February 22, Hitler was recorded saying &quot;We shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jew&quot; to his closest associates.

Arguments that no documentation links Hitler to &quot;the Holocaust&quot; ignore the records of his speeches kept by Nazi leaders such as Joseph Goebbels and rely on artificially limiting the Holocaust to exclude what we do have documentation on, such as the T-4 Euthanasia Program and the Kristallnacht pogrom.

===Who knew about the killings?===

Some claim that the full extent of what was happening in German-controlled areas was not known until after the war. However, even though Hitler did not talk about the camps in public, numerous rumors and eyewitness accounts from escapees and others gave some indication that Jews were being killed in large numbers. Since the early years of the war, the Polish government-in-exile published documents and organised meetings to spread word of the fate of the Jews. By early 1941, the British had received information via an intercepted Chilean memo that Jews were being targeted, and by late 1941 they had intercepted information about a number of large massacres of Jews conducted by German police. In an entry in the Friedrich Kellner Diary dated October 28, 1941, the German justice inspector Friedrich Kellner recorded a conversation he had in Laubach with a German soldier who had witnessed a massacre in Poland. Churchill, who was privy to intelligence reports derived from decoded German transmissions, first began mentioning &quot;mass killings&quot; in public at the same time. In the summer of 1942, a Jewish labor organization (the Bund) got word to London that 700,000 Polish Jews had already died, and the BBC took the story seriously, though the United States State Department did not.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Breitman, &quot;[http://www.archives.gov/iwg/research-papers/breitman-chilean-diplomats.html What Diplomats Learned about the Holocaust],&quot; US National Archives (accessed August 30, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, in November of 1942, a telegram from Europe which contained word about Hitler's plans was released by Stephen Wise of the World Jewish Congress, after a long wait for permission from the government.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Wistrich: Hitler and the Holocaust. Chapter 7. London 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to attempts by Jewish organizations to put Roosevelt under pressure to act on behalf of the European Jews, many of whom had tried in vain to enter either Britain or the U.S.

On December 17, 1942, however, after receiving a detailed eyewhitness account from Jan Karski, the Allies issued a formal declaration confirming and condemning Nazi extermination policy toward the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/research/library/faq/details.php?topic=01#05 When did the American press first report on the &quot;Final Solution&quot;?] (USHMM Research Library). Accessed 2006-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;11 Allies Condemn Nazi War on Jews: United Nations Issue Joint Declaration of Protest on 'Cold-Blooded Extermination'&quot;. New York Times, 18 December 1942, pp.1, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The US State Department was aware of the use and the location of the gas chambers of extermination camps, but refused pleas to bomb them out of operation. On May 12, 1943, Polish government-in-exile and Bund leader Szmul Zygielbojm committed suicide in London to protest the inaction of the world with regard to the Holocaust, stating in part in his suicide letter:

:''I cannot continue to live and to be silent while the remnants of Polish Jewry, whose representative I am, are being killed. My comrades in the Warsaw ghetto fell with arms in their hands in the last heroic battle. I was not permitted to fall like them, together with them, but I belong with them, to their mass grave. 
:''By my death, I wish to give expression to my most profound protest against the inaction in which the world watches and permits the destruction of the Jewish people. 

The death camps were discussed between American and British leaders at the Bermuda Conference in April of 1943. The large camps near Auschwitz were finally surveyed by plane in April of 1944, many months after the German air force ceased to be a serious danger. While all important German cities and production centers were bombed by Allied forces until the end of the war, no attempt was made to collapse the system of mass annihilation by destroying pertinent structures or train tracks, even though Churchill was a proponent of bombing parts of the Auschwitz complex. Throughout the war, Britain also pressed European leaders to prevent &quot;illegal&quot; Jewish immigration and sent ships to block the sea-route to Palestine (from which Britain withdrew in 1948), turning back many refugees. &lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Wistrich: Hitler and the Holocaust. Chapter 7. London 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate also continues on how much average Germans knew about the Holocaust. Recent historical work suggests that the majority of Germans knew that Jews were being indiscriminately killed and persecuted, even if they did not know of the specifics of the death camps.  Robert Gellately, a historian at Oxford University, conducted a widely-respected survey of the German media before and during the war, concluding that there was &quot;substantial consent and active participation of large numbers of ordinary Germans&quot; in aspects of the Holocaust, and documenting that the sight of columns of slave laborers were common, and that the basics of the concentration camps, if not the extermination camps, were widely known.&lt;ref&gt;John Ezard, &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,439168,00.html Germans knew of Holocaust Horror about Death Camps],&quot; Guardian, February 17, 2001. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and philosophical interpretations==

The Holocaust and the historical phenomenon of Nazism, which has since become the dark symbol of the 20th century's crimes, is the subject of numerous historical, psychological, sociological, literary, and philosophical studies. All types of scholars have tried to give an answer to what appears as the most irrational act of the Western World, which, until at least World War II, had been so sure of its eminent superiority to other civilizations. Frankfurt school philosopher Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer thus began the ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'': 

&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;Enlightenment, understood in the widest sense as the advance of thought, has always aimed at liberating human beings from fear and installing them as masters. Yet the wholly enlightened earth is radiant with triumphant calamity.&lt;ref&gt; Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', 2002 translation) &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Theodor Adorno went as far as ceasing to work as a composer, declaring: &quot;writing any more poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric&quot; (''Nach Ausschwitz noch ein Gedicht zu schreiben ist barbarisch''). Thus, Auschwitz became the metonymic name for the Holocaust and the Nazi barbarity. Although Adorno later retracted this statement, declaring that &quot;Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as the tortured have to scream...&quot;, the concepts of civilization and of progress themselves were severely called into question, and in a much greater manner than had happened due to World War I's massive killings. Germany, which was considered one of the most enlightened European countries, radiant with literature and philosophy (Goethe, Hegel, etc.), art (Bach, Bauhaus, etc.), and which had quickly followed in Great Britain's and France's steps during the competition induced during the New Imperialism period (starting in 1860s), had made itself guilty of one of the biggest crimes against humanity ever committed. Thus, the juridical concept of crimes against humanity was created to qualify what could not be qualified. It was left to literature, such as Primo Levi's ''If This Is a Man'' (1947) or Robert Antelme's ''The Human Race'' (1947) to describe what poetry, according to Adorno, could not describe.

Thus, until this day, many different people have tried to explain what many deemed unexplainable due to its horror. One important philosophical question, addressed as early as 1933 by Wilhelm  Reich in ''Mass Psychology of Fascism'', was the mystery of the obedience of the German people to such an &quot;insane&quot; operation. Hannah Arendt, in her 1963 report on Adolf Eichmann, presented him as a symbol of dull obedience to authority in what was at first seen as a scandalous book, ''Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil'' (1963), which has since become a classic of political philosophy. Thus, Arendt opposed herself to the first, immediate, explanation, which accused the Nazis of &quot;cruelty&quot; and of &quot;sadism&quot;. Later, the historians' debate concerning functionalism and intentionalism also demonstrated that the question could not be simplified to a question of cruelty. Many people who participated in the Holocaust were normal people, according to Arendt, and that is the real scandal. This led Stanley Milgram's to conduct psychological experiences on obedience, opening up the way to understanding the psychological experiences of &quot;authority&quot; and charisma. The question of charisma was renewed by Gustave Le Bon's 19th century studies about crowd psychology. Thus, his work acquired new force, although Hitler himself had been inspired by Le Bon's description of propaganda techniques to write ''Mein Kampf''. Furthermore, Hannah Arendt and some authors such as Sven Lindqvist and Olivier LeCour Grandmaison tried to point toward a relative continuity between the crimes committed against &quot;primitive&quot; people during colonialism and the Holocaust. They most notably argued that many techniques that the Nazis industrialized had been experimented on in other continents, starting with the concentration camps invented during the Second Boer War if not before. This thesis was met with fierce opposition by some groups who argued that nothing could be compared to the Holocaust, not even other genocides: although the Herero genocide (1904-07) and the Armenian genocide (1915-17) are commonly considered as the first genocides in history, many argued that the Holocaust had taken proportions that even these crimes against humanity had not achieved. 

The Holocaust was indeed characterized by an industrial project of extermination; compared to it, other genocides seemed to lack &quot;professionalism&quot;. This led authors such as Enzo Traverso to argue in ''The Origins of Nazi Violence'' that Auschwitz was &quot;an authentic product of Western civilization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; See also Enzo Traverso, [http://mondediplo.com/2005/02/15civildiso &quot;Nazism’s roots in European culture - Production line of murder&quot;] in ''Le Monde diplomatique'', February 2005 &lt;/ref&gt; Beginning his book with a description of the guillotine, which according to him marks the entry of the Industrial Revolution into capital punishment, and writes: &quot;Through an irony of history, the theories of Frederick Taylor&quot; (taylorism) were applied by a totalitarian system to serve &quot;not production, but extermination.&quot; (see also Heidegger's comments). In the wake of Hannah Arendt, Traverso describes the colonial domination during the New Imperialism period through &quot;rational organization&quot;, which lead in a number of cases to extermination. However, this argument, which insists on the industrialization and technical rationality through which the Holocaust itself was carried out (the organization of trains, technical details, etc. &amp;mdash; see Adolf Eichmann's bureaucratic work), was in turn opposed by other people. These point out that the 1994 Rwandan genocide only used machetes. 

Others have presented the Holocaust as a product of German history, analyzing its deep roots in German society: &quot;German authoritarianism, feeble liberalism, brash nationalism or virulent anti-Semitism. From A. J. P. Taylor's ''The Course of German History'' fifty-five years ago to Daniel Goldhagen's recent ''Hitler's Willing Executioners'', Nazism is understood as the outcome of a long history of uniquely German traits&quot;, writes Russell Jacoby.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20031013/jacoby &quot;Savage Modernism&quot;], Russell Jacoby, ''The Nation'', October 13, 2003 issue &lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while many pointed out that the specificity of the Holocaust was also rooted in the constant antisemitism from which Jews had been the target since the foundation of Christianism (and the myth of the &quot;deicide people&quot;), others underlined that in the 19th century, pseudo-scientific racist theories had been elaborated in order to justify, in a general way, white supremacy. In his works on &quot;biopolitics&quot;, philosopher Michel Foucault also traced the origins of &quot;state racism&quot; to the eugenicist policies invented during the 19th century (it is one of the few praise that Foucault accorded to Freud's psychoanalysis, that he adamantly opposed himself to such a project of &quot;racial hygiene&quot;).

===Why did people participate in, authorize, or tacitly accept the killing?===
====Obedience====
Stanley Milgram was one of a number of post-war psychologists and sociologists who tried to address why people obeyed immoral orders in the Holocaust. Milgram's findings demonstrated that reasonable people, when instructed by a person in a position of  authority, obeyed commands entailing what they believed to be the death or suffering of others.  These results were confirmed in other experiments as well, such as the Stanford prison experiment. In his book ''Mass Psychology of Fascism'' (1933), Wilhelm Reich also tried to explain this obedience. The work became known as the foundation of Freudo-Marxism. Nobel prize winner Elias Canetti also addressed the problem of mass obedience in ''Masse und Macht'' (1960 - &quot;Crowds and Power&quot;), developing an original theory of the consequences of commandments orders both in the obedient person and in the commander, who may well become a &quot;despotic paranoiac&quot;. Two recent &quot;experiments&quot;, one called The Third Wave and one conducted by  Jane Elliott, tried answer the question of: &quot;How can a people be a part of something terrible and then claim at the demise that they were not really involved?&quot;

====Psychological mechanisms====

The Holocaust is a clear example of two factors at work. One is described by the &quot;boiling frog&quot; theory, which says that an enormous change will not be noticed if it occurs in gradual steps. The other factor is the primal and powerful mechanism of herding, which has its home in the limbic system and ensures that individuals conform to the group. This mechanism has evolved through natural selection to ensure that human groups survive.  Together, these factors make conforming to the group a stronger impulse than breaking out, even if the individual does not agree with what the group is doing.  So long as the gradual changes in group behaviour are small, herding can eventually take the group towards a state that is far removed from past behavior and is more and more extreme.  Thus, participants in the Holocaust may have privately felt horror or disgust at what they were ordered to do but stayed in line with the group.  These effects have been exploited many times in history by demagogues and revolutionaries; they are also seen in bullying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://orp.uoregon.edu/downloads/Bullying.pdf Bullying in Schools] - URL retrieved September 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of mass psychology, kick-started by Carl Jung but currently being developed under various labels, including socionomics (see references on that page), suggest that the causal mechanism for crowd behaviour is the reverse of what is commonly believed.  The socionomic perspective says that, rather than persecution making people fearful and downtrodden, fearful and downtrodden people look for someone to persecute.&lt;ref name=Prechter&gt;Prechter, Robert R., Jr.]] 2000. ''The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior and the New Science of Socionomics''. New Classics Library. ISBN 0932750494.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jungian-socionomic analysis says that after the humiliation of World War I, the economic ruin of the Weimar Republic, being forced to pay war reparations and the Great Depression, it was natural for the German people to become angry and look for someone on whom to vent their anger; herding behaviour amplified this anger and the Holocaust was the result.&lt;ref Name=Prechter/&gt;

====Functionalism versus intentionalism====


A major issue in contemporary Holocaust studies is the question of ''functionalism'' versus ''intentionalism''. The terms were coined in a 1981 article by the British Marxist historian Timothy Mason to describe two schools of thought about the origins of the Holocaust. Intentionalists hold that the Holocaust was the result of a long-term masterplan on the part of Hitler's and that Hitler was the driving force behind the Holocaust. Functionalists hold that Hitler was anti-Semitic, but that he did not have a masterplan for genocide. Functionalists see the Holocaust as coming from below in the ranks of the German bureaucracy with little or no involvement on the part of Hitler. Functionalists stress that the Nazi anti-Semitic policy was constantly evolving in ever more radical directions and the end product was the Holocaust.

Intentionalists like Lucy Dawidowicz argue that the Holocaust was planned by Hitler from the very beginning of his political career, at very least from 1919 on, if not earlier. Later, Dawidowicz was to date the decision for genocide back to November 11, 1918. Other Intentionalists like Andreas Hillgruber, Karl Dietrich Bracher, Gerhard Weinberg and Klaus Hildebrand suggested that Hitler had decided upon the Holocaust sometime in the early 1920s. More  recent intentionalist historians like Eberhard Jäckel continue to emphasize the relative earliness of the decision to kill the Jews, although they are not willing to claim that Hitler planned the Holocaust from the beginning. Saul Friedländer has argued that Hitler was an extreme anti-Semite from 1919 on, but he did not decide upon genocide until the middle of 1941. Yet another group of intentionalist historians such as the American Arno J. Mayer claimed Hitler only ordered the Holocaust in December 1941. 

Functionalists like Hans Mommsen, Martin Broszat, Götz Aly, Raul Hilberg and Christopher Browning hold that the Holocaust was started in 1941-1942 as a result of the failure of the Nazi deportation policy and the impending military losses in Russia. They claim that what some see as extermination fantasies outlined in Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' and other Nazi literature were mere propaganda and did not constitute concrete plans. In ''Mein Kampf'' Hitler repeatedly states his inexorable hatred of the Jewish people, but nowhere does he proclaim his intention to exterminate the Jewish people. 

Furthermore, Functionalists point to the fact that in the 1930s, Nazi policy aimed at trying to make life so unpleasant for German Jews that they would leave Germany. Adolf Eichmann was in charge of facilitating Jewish emigration by whatever means possible from 1937 until October 3, 1941, when German Jews were forbidden to leave, Reinhard Heydrich issuing an order to that effect. Functionalists point to the SS's support for a time in the late 1930s for Zionist groups as the preferred solution to the &quot;Jewish Question&quot; as another sign that there was no masterplan for genocide. The SS only ceased their support for German Zionist groups in May 1939 when Joachim von Ribbentrop informed Hitler of this, and Hitler ordered Himmler to cease and desist as the creation of Israel was not a goal Hitler thought worthy of German foreign policy.   

In particular, Functionalists have noted that in German documents from 1939 to 1941, the term &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot; was clearly meant to be a &quot;territorial solution&quot;, that is the entire Jewish population was to be expelled somewhere far from Germany and not allowed to come back. At first, the SS planned to create a gigantic &quot;Jewish Reservation&quot; in the Lublin, Poland area, but the so-called &quot;Lublin Plan&quot; was vetoed by Hans Frank, the Governor-General of occupied Poland who refused to allow the SS to ship any more Jews to the Lublin area after November, 1939. The reason why Frank vetoed the &quot;Lublin Plan&quot; was not due to any humane motives, but rather because he was opposed to the SS &quot;dumping&quot; Jews into the Government-General. In 1940, the SS and the German Foreign Office had the so-called &quot;Madagascar Plan&quot; to deport the entire Jewish population of Europe to a &quot;reservation&quot; on Madagascar. The &quot;Madagascar Plan&quot; was cancelled because Germany could not defeat the United Kingdom and until the British blockade was broken, the &quot;Madagascar Plan&quot; could not be put into effect. Finally, Functionalist historians have made much of a memorandum written by Himmler in May, 1940 explicitly rejecting extermination of the entire Jewish people as &quot;un-German&quot; and going on to recommend to Hitler the &quot;Madagascar Plan&quot; as the preferred &quot;territorial solution&quot; to the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;. Not until July 1941 did the term &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish Question&quot;  come to mean extermination. 

Recently, a synthesis of the two schools has emerged that has been championed by such diverse historians such as the Canadian historian Michael Marrus, the Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer and the British historian Ian Kershaw that contends that Hitler was the driving force behind the Holocaust, but that he did not have a long-term plan and that much of the initiative for the Holocaust came from below in an effort to meet Hitler's perceived wishes. 

Another controversy was started by the sociologist Daniel Goldhagen, who argues that ordinary Germans were knowing and willing participants in the Holocaust, which he claims had its roots in a deep eliminationist German anti-Semitism. Most historians have disagreed with Goldhagen's thesis, arguing that while anti-Semitism undeniably existed in Germany, Goldhagen's idea of a uniquely German &quot;eliminationist&quot; anti-Semitism is untenable, and that the extermination was unknown to many and had to be enforced by the dictatorial Nazi apparatus.

====Religious hatred and racism====

The German Nazis considered their duty to overcome natural compassion and execute orders for what they believed to be higher ideals. Much research has been done to explain how ordinary people could have participated in such heinous crimes, but there is no doubt that, like in some religious conflicts in the past, some people poisoned with racial and religious ideology of hatred committed the crimes with sadistic pleasure. Crowd psychology has attempted to explain such heinous acts, although Gustave Le Bon's ''The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind'' (1895) was also a major influence of ''Mein Kampf'', in particular relating to the propaganda techniques described in it. Sadistic acts were perhaps most notable in the case of the genocide committed by members of the Ustaše, whose enthusiasm and sadism in their killings of Serbs appalled Germans, Italians, and even German SS officers, who even acted to restrain the Ustashe. However, concentration camp literature, such as the one written by Primo Levi or Robert Antelme, described numerous individual sadistic acts, including ones committed by Kapos.

Some authors, such as liberal philosopher Hannah Arendt in ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951), Swedish writer Sven Lindqvist or French historian Olivier LeCour Grandmaison have also linked the Holocaust to colonialism. They argue that techniques put in place during the New Imperialism period (first of all, concentration camps during the Boer War), as well as the pseudo-scientific theories elaborated during this period (e.g., Arthur de Gobineau's 1853 ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races'') had been fundamental in preparing the conditions of possibility of the Holocaust. Others authors have adamantly opposed these views, on behalf of the &quot;unicity&quot; of the Holocaust, compared to any other type of genocide. Philosopher Michel Foucault also traced the origins of the Holocaust and of &quot;racial policies&quot; to what he called &quot;state racism&quot;, which is a part of &quot;biopolitics&quot;.

Finally, many have pointed the ancient roots of antisemitism, which has been present in the Western world since the foundation of Christianity. These sentiments were not different in pre-war Germany than elsewhere, but the Nazis were the first political party to organize, promote, and officialize antisemitism, while withdrawing legal protection from Jews. Modern ecumenism efforts, in particular by the Roman Catholic Church who asked pardon to the Jews, are being done in order to avoid any repetition of such acts.

==Aftermath==
Until recently, Germany refused to allow access to massive Holocaust-related archives located in Bad Arolsen due to, among other factors, privacy concerns. However, in May 2006, a 20-year effort by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum led to the announcement that 30-50 million pages would be made accessible to historians and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/8633EA3D-1AC2-41DF-9B7B-D2C385B1E10F.htm Germany to open Holocaust archives] Al-Jazeera 19 April, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displaced Persons and the State of Israel===

The Holocaust and its aftermath left millions of refugees, including many Jews who had lost most or all of their family members and possessions, and often faced persistent anti-Semitism in their home countries. The original plan of the Allies was to repatriate these &quot;Displaced Persons&quot; to their country of origin, but many refused to return, or were unable to as their homes or communities had been destroyed.  As a result, more than 250,000 languished in DP camps for years after the war ended.

While Zionism had been prominent before the Holocaust, afterward it became almost universally accepted among Jews. Many Zionists, pointing to the fact that Jewish refugees from Germany and Nazi-occupied lands had been turned away by other countries, argued that if a Jewish state had existed at the time, the Holocaust could not have occurred on the scale it did.  With the rise of Zionism, Palestine became the destination of choice for Jewish refugees, but local Arabs opposed the immigration, the United Kingdom refused to allow Jewish refugees into the Mandate, and many countries in the Soviet Bloc made any emigration illegal.  Former Jewish partisans in Europe, along with the Haganah in Palestine, organized a massive effort to smuggle Jews into Palestine, called Berihah, which eventually transported 250,000 Jews (both DPs and those who hid during the war) to the Mandate. By 1952, the Displaced Persons camps were closed, with over 80,000 Jewish DPs in the United States, about 136,000 in Israel, and another 20,000 in other nations, including Canada and South Africa.

===Legal proceedings against Nazis===
[[Image:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|left|thumbnail|250px|Defendants at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] - Front row: Göring, Heß, von Ribbentrop, and Keitel. Second row: Dönitz, Raeder, Schirach, Sauckel.]]

The juridical notion of crimes against humanity was invented following the Holocaust. The sheer number of people murdered and the transnational nature of the slaughter shattered any notion of national sovereignty taking precedence over international law when prosecuting these crimes. There were a number of legal efforts established to bring Nazis and their collaborators to justice. Some of the higher ranking Nazi officials were tried as part of the Nuremberg Trials, presided over by an Allied court; the first international tribunal of its kind. In total, 5,025 Nazi criminals were convicted between 1945-1949 in the American, British and French zones of Germany.  Other trials were conducted in the countries in which the defendants were citizens &amp;mdash; in West Germany and Austria, many Nazis were let off with light sentences, with the claim of &quot;following orders&quot; ruled a mitigating circumstance, and many returned to society soon afterward.

An ongoing effort to pursue Nazis and collaborators resulted, famously, in the capture of Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann in Argentina (an operation led by Rafi Eitan) and to his subsequent trial in Israel in 1961. Simon Wiesenthal became one of the most famous Nazi hunters. Some former Nazis, however, escaped any charges. Thus, Reinhard Gehlen a former intelligence officer of the Wehrmacht, set up the ODESSA network, which helped many ex-Nazis to escape in Franquist Spain, Latin America or in the Middle East. Gehlen managed to turn around and work for the CIA, and created in 1956 the ''Bundesnachrichtendienst'' (BND), the German intelligence agency, which he directed until 1968. Klaus Barbie, known as &quot;the Butcher of Lyon&quot; for his role at the head of the Gestapo, was protected from 1945 to 1955 by the MI-5 and the CIA, before fleeing to South America where he had a hand in Luis García Meza Tejada's 1980 ''Cocaine Coup'' in Bolivia. Barbie was finally arrested in 1983 and sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity in 1987. In October 2005, Aribert Heim (aka &quot;Doctor Death&quot;) was found to be living for twenty years in Spain, protected by ODESSA. Paul Schäfer, who had founded Colonia Dignidad in Chile, was arrested in 2005 on child sex abuses charges. Furthermore, some &quot;enlightened&quot; Nazis were pardoned and permitted to become members of the Christian Democracy, among whom Kurt Georg Kiesinger, who became Germany's Chancellor for a period in the 1960s, Hans Filbinger, who became Minister President of Baden-Württemberg, and Kurt Waldheim, who became Secretary-General of the United Nations and President of Austria.

===Legal action against genocide===

The Holocaust also galvanized the international community to take action against future genocide, including the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1948. While international human rights law moved forward quickly in the wake of the Holocaust, international criminal law has been slower to advance; after the Nuremberg trials and the Japanese war crime trials it was over forty years until the next such international criminal procedures, in 1993 in Yugoslavia. In 2002, the International Criminal Court was set up.

Although the Holocaust is often cited as the canonical example of genocide, none of its perpetrators were tried for that crime, as the crime of genocide had not been established at that stage. The first-ever convictions for genocide under the 1948 Convention were handed down on September 2, 1998, when the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda found Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of a small town in Rwanda, guilty of nine counts of genocide committed during the Rwandan Genocide in 1994. No state has as yet been convicted of genocide. Only one inter-state case has so far been brought before the International Court of Justice, that of ''Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro'', which has yet to be resolved.

==Holocaust denial==

Holocaust denial, (referred to by its supporters as ''Holocaust revisionism''), is the belief that the Holocaust did not occur, or, more specifically: that far fewer than around six million Jews were killed by the Nazis (numbers below one million, most often around 30,000 are typically cited); that there never was a centrally-planned Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jews; and/or that there were not mass killings at the extermination camps. Those who hold this position often further claim that Jews and/or Zionists know that the Holocaust never occurred, yet that they are engaged in a massive conspiracy to maintain the illusion of a Holocaust to further their political agenda.  As the Holocaust is generally considered by historians to be one of the most documented events in recent history, these views are not accepted as credible by scholars, with organizations such as the American Historical Association, the largest society of historians in the United States, stating that Holocaust denial is &quot;at best, a form of academic fraud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Niewyk, ed. ''The Holocaust: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', D.C. Heath and Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holocaust ''deniers'' almost always prefer to be called Holocaust ''revisionists''. Most scholars contend that the latter term is misleading. Historical revisionism, in the original sense of the word, is a well-accepted and mainstream part of the study of history; it is the reexamination of accepted history, with an eye towards updating it with newly discovered, more accurate, and/or less biased information, or viewing known information from a new perspective. In contrast, negationists typically willfully misuse or ignore historical records in order to attempt to prove their conclusions, as Gordon McFee writes:

:'' 'Revisionists' depart from the conclusion that the Holocaust did not occur and work backwards through the facts to adapt them to that preordained conclusion. Put another way, they reverse the proper methodology [...], thus turning the proper historical method of investigation and analysis on its head.''&lt;ref&gt;Gord McFee, &quot;[http://www.holocaust-history.org/revisionism-isnt/ why 'Revisionism' isn't],&quot; The Holocaust History Project (accessed June 8, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Public Opinion Quarterly summarized that: &quot;No reputable historian questions the reality of the Holocaust, and those promoting Holocaust denial are overwhelmingly anti-Semites and/or neo-Nazis.&quot; Holocaust denial has also become popular among Muslim opponents of Israel.  The doctoral dissertation of Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian National Authority since 2005, raised doubts that gas chambers were used for the extermination of Jews and suggested that the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was &quot;less than a million.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/1414.html Was Abu Mazen a Holocaust Denier?] By Brynn Malone (History News Network)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Area=sr&amp;ID=SR01503 Abu Mazen: A Political Profile. Zionism and Holocaust Denial] by Yael Yehoshua ([[MEMRI]]) April 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Abbas has, however, not espoused this position since his appointment as Palestinian Prime Minister in 2003, and has denied being a Holocaust denier.  In late 2005 Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad described the Holocaust of European Jewry as &quot;the myth of the Jews' massacre.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4527142.stm Iranian Leader Denies Holocaust] BBC News 14 December, 2005 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Smith, &quot;The Polls--A Review: The Holocaust Denial Controversy.&quot; Public Opinion Quarterly 59 (Summer 1995): 269-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Public espousal of Holocaust denial is a crime in ten European countries (including France, Poland, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Romania, and Germany), while the Nizkor Project attempts to counter it on the Internet.

On December 11, 2006, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad opened the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust in Tehran, Iran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6167695.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survivors' welfare==
As of 2005, of the nearly 400,000 Holocaust survivors residing in Israel, 40% live below the poverty line, increasing significantly since 1999 and resulting in heated and dramatic protests on the part of survivors against the Israeli government and related agencies. The average rate of cancer among survivors is nearly two and a half times that of the national average. The average cases of colon cancer among survivors are nine times higher than the national average, which is attributed to the conditions of starvation experienced by survivors as well as extreme stress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:fMg4sINHVxwJ:www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/663880.html+%2240+percent+of+Holocaust+survivors+living+in+Israel+today+live+below+the+poverty+line,+Israel+Radio+reported+Thursday%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox-a &quot;40% of Holocaust survivors in Israel live below poverty line&quot;], ''Haaretz'', December 29, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claimscon.org/forms/allocations/Social%20Safety%20Nets.pdf &quot;Social Safety Nets&quot; (PDF)], In ''Re Holocaust Victim Assets Litigation (Swiss Banks)'', September 11, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on culture==
===Holocaust theology===


On account of the magnitude of the Holocaust, many theologians have re-examined the classical theological views on God's goodness and actions in the world. Some believers and former believers question whether people can still have any faith in God after the Holocaust, and some of the theological responses to these questions are explored in Holocaust theology.

===Art and literature===


German philosopher Theodor Adorno famously commented that &quot;writing poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric,&quot; and the Holocaust has indeed had a profound impact on art and literature, for both Jews and non-Jews. Some of the more famous works are by Holocaust survivors or victims, such as Elie Wiesel, Primo Levi, and Anne Frank, but there is a substantial body of literature and art in many languages. Indeed, Paul Celan wrote his poem ''Todesfuge''[http://www.artofeurope.com/celan/cel8.htm] as a direct response to Adorno's dictum.  

The Holocaust has also been the subject of many films, including Oscar winners ''Schindler's List'' and ''Life Is Beautiful''. With the aging population of Holocaust survivors, there has been increasing attention in recent years to preserving the memory of the Holocaust. The result has included extensive efforts to document their stories, including the Survivors of the Shoah project and [http://www.fourseasonsdocumentary.com Four Seasons Documentary], as well as institutions devoted to memorializing and studying the Holocaust, including Yad Vashem in Israel and the US Holocaust Museum.

===Freemasonry===
After the World War II, the forget-me-not&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galenlodge.co.uk/forgetmenot.htm ''Das Vergissmeinnicht The Forget-Me-Not''] Accessed February 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; flower was used again as a Masonic emblem at the 1948, first,  Annual Convention in  of the United Grand Lodges of Germany, Ancient Free &amp; Accepted Masons. The badge is now worn in the coat lapel by Freemasons around the world to remember all those that have suffered in the name of Freemasonry, and specifically those during the Nazi era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galenlodge.co.uk/forgetmenot.htm''Flower Badge as told by Galen Lodge No 2394 (UGLE)''] Accessed March 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mastermason.com/monlou522/forget~me~not.html ''Flower Badge''] Accessed March 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holocaust Memorial Days===

In a unanimous vote, the United Nations General Assembly voted on November 1, 2005, to designate January 27 as the &quot;International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust.&quot;  January 27, 1945 is the day that the former Nazi concentration and extermination camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated. Even before the UN vote, January 27 was already observed as Holocaust Memorial Day in the United Kingdom since 2001, as well as other countries, including Sweden, Italy, Germany, Finland, Denmark and Estonia. Israel observes Yom HaShoah vea hagvora, the &quot;Day of Remembrance of the Holocaust and the courage of the Jewish people ,&quot; on the 27th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan, which generally falls in April. This memorial day is also commonly observed by Jews outside of Israel.

[[image:Master link pliers.jpg|300px|thumb|right|If the master link is too tight to remove by hand, these pliers, made specially to grip the rounded  rollers, will easily remove it.]]
==Introduction==
The removing or shortening of a bike chain usually requires a chain tool, a tool that can drive a pin out of the chain.  Some individuals choose to disassemble and reassemble a derailleur's jockey wheels rather than to cut a chain, for example, when changing a derailleur. Many older bikes, ''without'' a derailleur, have a master link that can be opened with a flat-head screwdriver, whereas chains in modern derailleur bicycles more often use a master link like the ones shown in the images below.   Sometimes a master link is supplied as a part of a new chain.

==With a Master Link==
The SRAM [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_link '''master link'''] and links that resemble it can be opened by pushing the outer plates of the master link together and inward at the same time.  This can be done with your hands, or if it's too tight it may require a special tool (see image).   Ordinary pliers have been known to work for some, but the process can be painful and uncertain without the proper item.   In an emergency, and provided that you do not mind ''destroying'' the master link in the process, a chain tool can be used to drive out its pins.   These links are compatible with Shimano chains, as long as they are for the same number of gears on the cassette.  i.e. 7, 8 or 9 cogs.

Manufacturers rarely state clearly that their products are intended for repeated re-use, and seem to avoid the issue in their advertising.   Some riders and suppliers are more forthcoming however, and say from experience that SRAM PowerLink products ''can'' be re-used, but that their PowerLock (10 speed) products cannot.   The SRAM site itself makes no such claim and as always, riders need to use caution in such matters.

==Without a Master Link==
If you do not use a master link, it is possible to break a chain with a chain tool (see image).   Unfortunately, chain tools are no use at re-inserting ''straight'' pins, (unlike Shimano ''tapered'' pins), so the important thing here is to avoid removing them all the way; they must stay in the outer plates, even when the rollers are free.   Place the chain in the tool and carefully line up the tool's pin with a rivet of the chain; tighten the screw until the pin pushes out far enough so that it still remains generously within the outer plate.  If the rivet is pushed all the way out, it is very difficult to reinsert it, and it is likely that a master link will be needed to make the connection.   Withdraw the chain tool's screw to break the chain, and if necessary it can be advanced a little more until it can be separated.

==Shimano Riveted Chains==
Shimano chains use special tapered rivets that ''can'' be guided into the holes in the outer plates.   These use a pin driver (chain tool) to both drive out the pins and to push the pins into place.   Any pin excess is then snapped off, at a grooved weak point in the pin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Be considerate of other campers.  When purchasing tents, buy ones in muted colors that will blend in with the environment.  Blues, greens, and browns are preferred to reds and oranges.  People go camping to escape the garishness of the city—leave that behind.

Also be mindful of the noise level made in your camp.  Don't be a nuisance.  If camping in the wilderness, be sure to make your camp out of sight of the trail.  Most National Forests have guidelines for where you can camp in relation to the trail.  Find out what those guidelines are and follow them.

Do not enter anyone else's camp site without their permission, especially when traveling to or from your campsite to other places on the campground.  It is very rude to cut through another camp.  Use the road or trail, even if it will take longer.

Leave the area cleaner than you found it.  If you are leading a group of youngsters on a campout, have a contest before you pile back in your cars to go home: see who can collect the most litter (define &quot;most&quot; first though - it can mean by volume, by weight, or by item count).  Offer a prize to the one who collects the most (such as getting to choose which seat he or she will sit in on the trip home).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac all cause a rash when oils from the plant come into contact with the skin.  The contact does not have to be direct - it can be transferred from the plant to another item, and ''then'' to the skin.  Tools, pets, and clothing can all transfer the oil from the plant to the skin.  The best defense against this rash is to be able to recognize these plants, stay alert, and avoid contact.  If you do come into contact with any of them, the first thing you should do is immediately wash the affected area with soap and water.  This will, in many cases, prevent the rash from developing.  If contact went undetected and a rash does develop, apply Calamine lotion or a cortizone cream to the affected area.  If the rash develops on the face or genitals, seek medical attention.

This paragraph says that HDLs were invented for programming programmable logic.
This is clearly not true. They were invented to simulate ASIC designs. I think minor
updates can fix this factual error and get this paragraph back on track. It should after
all just set up the field for the later sections that are language specific.

**If a Wikipedia article on the term exists, link to it

:I don't really like the idea of linking to the Wikipedia article, we should have enough of a definition on each term that there is no need for the Wikipedia article. Also I believe only terms that are defined in this book elsewhere should be listed here. Perhaps instead of linking to the Wikipedia article we could try to link to the definition in this book so readers can jump to that part of the book to read more about it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

Darklama, I agree with linking to it in the book. I tried to only add definitions which are already in the book but there are a lot, almost too much to go through. [[User:Rmccue|Rmccue]] 08:27, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

==APDIP==

The Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme (APDIP) is an initiative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) that aims to promote the development and application of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for poverty alleviation and sustainable human development in the Asia-Pacific region. It does so through three core programme areas, namely, Policy Development and Dialogue; Access; and Content Development and Knowledge Management.

In collaboration with national governments, APDIP seeks to assist national and regional institutions in the Asia-Pacific through activities that involve awareness-raising and advocacy, building capacities, promoting ICT policies and dialogue, promoting equitable access to tools and technologies, knowledge sharing, and networking. Strategic public-private sector partnerships and opportunities for technical cooperation among developing countries are APDIP’s key building blocks in implementing each programme activity.</text>

Another Strategy guide.

* '''Speedy delete''' as per [[WB:DP|policy]] (transwikied to more appropriate wiki). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:24, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I'll work on deleting all these videogame guides that have already been transwikied sometime tonight, hopefully. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  It's a guide and not Wikibook material. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 21:48, 16 October 2006 (UTC)
* &lt;s&gt;'''Keep'''.&lt;/s&gt; I would like to point out that this is as much a study guide for urban planning which uses a video game as a text, as it is a video game guide. It may need a clean-up to reduce the emphasis on the game (for instance, it should almost certainly be renamed something like [[Urban Planning]] and some of the pages dealing solely with the game should be dropped, but - given that some first year urban planning classes ''do'' use SimCity as a text, i would argue that it is worth keeping around.

Consider the Preface:

::* A comprehensive strategy guide for those playing SimCity (and its various spinoffs).
::* A useful book for anyone conducting research into the game.
::* '''An introduction to the basic concepts of real-life Urban planning and Municipal government, as used in the SimCity games (with potential use in :urban planning or civics classes).'''

:'''Given the potential use of SimCity games in Urban Planning or Civics classes, this book will explain how various real-life Planning concepts have been incorporated into the game.''' For game-players, this will add depth to the explanations of the real-life basis of key elements of the game. '''For educators and students, this will allow this book to function as a 'study-guide' for courses which use SimCity to introduce basic concepts of Urban Planning and Design, as well as Municipal government (including Municipal fiscal management).'''

- [[SimCity/Preface]] (Emphasis mine)

Points one and two should be dropped here, but - as the boldened text and point three here show - it has been designed (from the beginning) as a study guide for urban planning which uses a video game as an example text. The point is made even clearer in the introduction:

:'''Given the potential use of SimCity games in urban planning courses, this book will explain how various real-life planning concepts have been incorporated into the game.''' For game-players, this will add depth to the explanations of elements of the game. '''For educators and students, this will allow this book to function as a 'study-guide' for courses which use SimCity to introduce basic concepts of urban planning, design, as well as government, and fiscal management. So, for example, the section on [[SimCity/Building Transportation|Building Transportation]] will include a description of the importance of transport planning in real-life urban planning, as well as its incorporation into SimCity.'''

- [[SimCity/Introduction]] (Again, emphasis mine)

So how much of this is a game guide and how much deals with urban planning? Well, consider the chapter on municipal infrastructure (content dealing with municipal infrastructure is in bold):

:'''Municipal infrastructure typically includes transportation, sewer, reservoir, potable water supply systems, police stations and local jails, and other infrastructural capital - the built environment - under the jurisdiction of a municipal government or other local government.

:'''The terms urban infrastructure and rural development are often used interchangeably but imply either large cities or developing nations' concerns respectively. The terms public infrastructure or critical infrastructure are also used interchangeably but suggest the inclusion of some facilities like hospitals, banks and concerns like national security and terrorism which are not under the mandate of municipal officials alone.

:'''Typically, infrastructure in the urban context denotes two general groups of support systems: transportation modalities (roads, rail, etc.) and utilities. These typically compose both public and private systems, and some ambiguously held in common.

:'''Infrastructure may also refer to necessary municipal or public services, whether provided by the government or by private companies. If provided by nature, e.g. the flow of a river, they are called nature's services and are distincted (at least in economics) as the product of natural capital. This may be augmented or directed by infrastructural capital, e.g. a dam or canal or irrigation ditch. In general what is called infrastructure tends to be very embedded in the natural landscape and cannot be moved from place to place. Even municipal services rely necessarily on fixed locations, e.g. fire stations in central positions in a city, radio towers on tall buildings, etc.

:'''Beyond transport (which is discussed in another chapter), Urban infrastructure includes:
:*'''Public utilities
:**'''Electricity
:**'''Natural gas
:**'''Coal delivery
:**'''Water supply
:**'''Sewers
:**'''Telephone service
:**'''Radio and television bandwidth allocation
:**'''Cable television service
:*'''Public services
:**'''Fire service or fire department
:**'''Flood protection
:**'''Police protection
:**'''Waste management
:*'''National Services
:**'''Defense
:**'''Monetary systems or currency, including the minting of coins, and printing and backing of banknotes.
:**'''Postal system
:*&quot;'''Soft Infrastructure&quot; is a term that denotes institutions that maintain the health and cultural standards of the population. Principally, this refers to:
:**'''Public education
:**'''Public health systems including public hospitals
:**'''Public libraries
:**'''Social welfare&lt;/b&gt;

:===In SimCity===
:A key aspect of SimCity is building tiles representing different utilities, public services, and soft infrastructure.

- [[SimCity/Municipal Infrastructure]] (Again, emphasis mine)

Obviously, most of the chapter deals with Municipal Infrastructure, with but one sentence on the game. 

I say this needs a clean up, with the video game de-emphasised, some of the pages deleted, and a new name. But the core of this book is indeed salvagable. - [[User:AmishThrasher|AmishThrasher]] 08:14, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

: '''Update:''' I've separated what I believe is salvagable from what isn't. [[Urban Planning]] probably needs a clean up, but is worth keeping. [[SimCity]] can go. For the material left over on [[SimCity]], I say '''delete'''. - [[User:AmishThrasher|AmishThrasher]] 08:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

::This is, i think, an interesting project, and one that I am inclined to watch closely. If we think of SimCity less like a &quot;game&quot;, and more like a &quot;city simulator&quot;, then suddenly the material fits the wikibooks mould. Consider other games, like &quot;America's Army&quot;, a game that was created by the US military as a combat simulator long before it became a popular game among teens. Instead of a strategy guide &quot;How to be awesome at America's Army&quot;, you said &quot;Combat tactics and strategies using America's Army as a simulator&quot;, everything would be fine with me (of course it would be up to the contributors to ensure that the content matched the scholarly aim of the title). Kudos. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:41, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

:::'''Delete'''. I would be receptive to the idea of a book that discusses SimCity in the context of Urban Planning, but this is a book that discusses (discussed) Urban Planning in the context of SimCity. The Wikibooks mold goes beyond how you think about the book and into how you write it. This book's content is &quot;How to play SimCity&quot;, not &quot;Lessons in Urban Planning from SimCity&quot;. --Brian Brondel 18:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
::::The book was created from material salvaged from the SimCity book, and it is rediculous to think that it would become a perfectly acceptable book overnight. The creation of a new book, even with some seed material, is a long and difficult process, and we must all remember that book creation (especially books on the boarderline of acceptability) takes time. The book does have a particular mission: &quot;Urban Planning using SimCity simulations&quot;, and there is an active author who seems to want to work to improve the book. The fact that the book currently doesnt live up to it's own aim is only a matter of poor timing. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:37, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
:::::PS Also, this VfD is for the deletion of the [[SimCity]] book, not the [[Urban Planning]] book. If you want to discuss the deletion of the later, you need to create a separate nomination. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:38, 24 October 2006 (UTC)
::::::No, I was referring to [[SimCity]]. If someone is interested in developing something along the lines of &quot;Lessons in Urban Planning from SimCity,&quot; and wants to use the existing material as a starting point, I'm all for that. --Brian Brondel 01:28, 25 October 2006 (UTC)
:::::::Sorry, I misunderstood you. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:55, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' -  Books about educational simulation games are very useful educational modules.  For example, see the conference on [http://isaga05.gatech.edu/ Simulation and Gaming] at College of Management, Georgia Institute of Technology with the accompanying [http://isaga05.gatech.edu/FacultyDev.doc faculty workshop] and [http://isaga05.gatech.edu/Teachers.doc teachers' workshop].  Please also see the [http://www.educationarcade.org/gec/conf2005 Games in Education] conference sponsored by partnership of MIT and University of Wisconsin.  Also, the book [[SimCity]] should not be renamed as [[Urban Planning]].  Urban planning is a large field, like computer science, with graduate degrees and areas of specialization.  All books which would be useful in a PhD or masters degree program in urban planning should not be put under the title &quot;Urban Planning&quot;... just as all books about computer programming should not all be put under one book name of &quot;Computer Programming&quot;.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 16:30, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - Wikibooks policy should make a distinction between (1) entertainment video games with no educational value and (2) educational simulation software programs which could be used in a classroom.  Books which would help a college class to use the educational computer software are suitable for Wikibooks.  Educational computer software which has been written to make learning enjoyable and more memorable -- by teaching system relationships in &quot;game&quot; format -- should get extra credit as an advanced education method, rather than disregard and mis-classification as entertainment.  Educational simulation games can be very helpful in the classroom; please see references in my &quot;Keep&quot; statement above.  -- [[User:KHatcher|KHatcher]] 21:32, 29 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''-SimCity has vast potential as both a Wikibook for Urban Planning and a game guide.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:RubberDuck|RubberDuck]] ([[User talk:RubberDuck|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/RubberDuck|contribs]]) 23:17, 29 Nov 2006  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

*'''Delete''' For thosee that have actually looked into the subject, you should know that the urban planning knowledge (which was almost solely about urban planning) has been moved out. If anything, &quot;lessons learned from simcity about urban planning&quot; would do better as a chapter in that book than as an entire book itself. Really, if we want to present knowledge on urban planning, it's not necessary to present it in the context of a video game.
*:It's not &quot;necessary&quot; to present any subject matter in terms of simulation software, but that doesnt stop people from doing it. If we have a book on urban planning, and if that book happens to use SimCity as a simulator for the topics discussed, then that's a benefit. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:14, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
*:I think the issue of whether the SimCity stuff should be a chapter or a separate book is better left to the writers and urban planning instructors than to the community at large. Either is allowed (according to consenus so far), subject to the caveats discussed here. At the same time, I approved earlier of keeping SimCity because I was under the impression that someone wanted to use it to develop it into an educational resource. That hasn't happened, and as more time passes I'm inclined to change my vote back. --[[User:140.252.3.207|140.252.3.207]] 01:49, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

'''Closed'''. Concensus so far seems to be to '''delete''' the [[SimCity]] book, but to allow the [[Urban Planning]] book to exist using SimCity-based games as simulation software for teaching the subject. I will delete the [[SimCity]] book myself soon (unless somebody else does it first). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:15, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

'''''Beauveria bassiana''''' is a fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout the world and causes disease in various insects by acting as a parasite; it thus belongs to the entomopathogenic fungi. It is being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, whitefly, different beetles and its use in the control of the malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation. The species is named after the Italian entomologist Agostino Bassi who discovered it in 1835 as the cause of the muscardine disease of silkworms. ''Beauveria bassiana'' (formerly also known as ''Tritirachium shiotae'') is the anamorph (the asexually reproducing form) of the fungus species ''Cordyceps bassiana''. The teleomorph (the sexually reproducing form) was discovered in 2001.

The disease caused by the fungus is called '''white muscardine disease'''. When spores of the fungus come into contact with the body of an insect host, they germinate, enter the body, and grow inside, eventually killing the insect. Afterwards a white mold grows on the cadaver and produces new spores. Most insects living near the soil have evolved natural defenses against the fungus, but many other insects are susceptible. 

==Uses==
The fungus does not appear to infect humans or other animals and is considered safe as an insecticide but the spores might cause a problem to people with breathing difficulties. The microscopic spores are typically sprayed on affected areas; the plan for malaria control is to coat mosquito nets with them.

===Target species===
''Beauveria bassiana'' parasitizes a very wide range of arthropod hosts, and so should be considered a nonselective pesticide. It should not be applied to flowers visited by pollinating insects &lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_128924.htm|title=EPA Factsheet|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Known targets include &lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/pathogens/fungi.html|title= Cornell Extension Service|accessdate= 2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uconn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hort.uconn.edu/IPM/general/htms/bassiana.htm|title=University of Connecticut Extension|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uminn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.entomology.umn.edu/cues/blackvw/blackve.html|title=University of Minnesota Extension|accessdate=2006-14-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

==Action==
''Beauveria bassiana'' rapidly colonizes the host organism, killing within a matter of days, depending on ambient temperatures. Best action is achieved during warm, humid weather.

==Application==
Primarily applied as an emulsified suspension (ES) or wettable powder (WP), though research is being done into using lures in order to limit exposure to non-target species.

==Precautions==
The low selectivity of this biocontrol is cause for great concern and caution when applying. It can affect beneficial insects (such as lady beetles), and can also affect the lungs and nasal passages of mammals, including humans&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontrol/pathogens/fungi.html|title= Cornell Extension Service|accessdate= 2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, particularly in individuals with compromised immune systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.doctorfungus.org/thefungi/beauveria.htm |title= Doctorfungus.org|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, though the US EPA lists it as safe for human exposure, with &quot;no expected health risks to humans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_128924.htm|title=EPA Factsheet|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance==
Soil dwelling arthropods generally have resistance, as the fungus is common in soils throughout the world.

Never really &quot;closed&quot; only comment was ''Merge into a book on physical fitness''.

* '''Merge''' into [[Physical Activity]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 15:45, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
* or maybe [[Scrapbook:Excersize and sports]]? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. I agree with Herby, this material doesnt need to be deleted. In general, it is better to keep good material then it is to delete it, even if it isnt sufficiently &quot;booklike&quot; for long periods of time. Wikipedia articles can be changed into book modules given enough elbow-grease. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|Discuss this]]) 02:24, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Keep'''. Move to [[Thick Sand Motorcycling]] and categorize in [[:Category:Motorbikes]]. Once we have more on related topics, it can be merged. For now, this seems like the only thing we have. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 15:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''. Again, It is better to keep unbooklike material then it is to delete it. It will have a home in the future.

=== [[Easy Ido]] merged here? ===
This pocket thread is for the discussion of the potential merge operation of Easy Ido to here. [[User:Phil.andy.graves|Phil.andy.graves]] 13:18, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
:I disagree. This goes against everything Ido was designed for, and is extremely ironic that a merge even be proposed. I essentially mean that Ido was designed as a level of facilitation an order above Esperanto, if only it were designed for only the romance languages. [[Easy Ido]] facilitates learning Ido just as Ido facilitates communication for people.

=== Is this project still alive? ===
Is this project still alive? If yes, I can contribute. In my view we need examples not only words.

==Orphaned page==
I am unable to determine what to do with [[Ido/fi]] if someone could translate it and decide if it's useful for this book any longer. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:08, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

== Examples ==

Needs a lot of example text. Paragraphs and paragraphs of text, with the translations afterwards for practice. Worksheets or 'flashcards,' too. Mostly just the examples, though. At the end of every lesson there should be topical example paragraphs for the reader to translate to build their vocabulary.

'''Busywork''' is the work that is done here at Wikibooks that doesn't produce book content, and that doesn't directly help the community towards its goals. Some people enjoy keeping active working on things such as aesthetics or organization here at Wikibooks, but Wikibookians should not be forced to perform repetitive or boring tasks in the interest of aesthetics or organization. Some basic guidelines to follow are:
#Don't make unreasonable demands concerning the content of certain pages, the actions of other contributors, or the methods in which tasks get done. 
#Discussion and talk archives, when needed, should be kept simple. Archiving a discussion should be a quick and easy task. Not all discussions need to be manually archived, remember: the entire edit summary of every page is already recorded, and old discussions can always be found in the history pages.
#Do not require the use of lots of fancy templates or boilerplate markup on discussions, archives, etc. If such markup is used to beautify a discussion that's okay, but it is not required for anybody to do so.
#Avoid relying on bots that perform complicated tasks on a regular basis. When such a bot fails, it will be left to human contributors to complete those tasks. Avoid complex tasks in general.

Remember, Wikibookians typically like to write book content, and if you force them to do all sorts of busywork, no books will ever be written.

'''[[w:Internet bots|Bots]]''' are computer programs that interface with Wikibooks, typically performing complex tasks faster than a person could. Bots can consist of functions inside client programs or tools that are only run under direct control of a human operator (semiautomatic), a program that performs tasks automatically without direct oversight of a human operator (fully automated), or anywhere in between.

Bots may be used provided they work as expected, do not interfere with or reduce people's ability to contribute meaningful content to Wikibooks, and do not perform any controversial actions or violate policies. Bots which break these basic principles may be blocked without warning.

== Bot Flag ==

The '''bot flag''' allows bots to receive more information with one request, to operate quicker by increasing limits normally placed on user accounts (such as edit limits), and makes it possible for users to hide changes performed by bots from [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]] and [[Special:Watchlist|watchlists]] by selecting the necessary options in the bot's [[Special:Preferences|preferences]]. The bot flag can be given to any bot account with a demonstrable need for it at the discretion of local [[Wikibooks:Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]].

A bot which only edits occasionally and does not flood the RC feed does not need the bot flag, and its actions should be openly visible to RC patrollers like all other actions.

Any Wikibookian who feels that a bot requires the flag can request so at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. The Wikibooks community might ask to see the source code of the bot, to see controlled demonstrations of the bot's abilities, that the owner demonstrate a need to perform edits beyond the normal rates and hide such edits, or express concern about giving a bot the bot flag. The granting of a bot flag remains up to the discretion of bureaucrats, unless reasonable concerns are raised by the community.

The bot flag can also be removed by local bureaucrats at their discretion if the bot has abused the extra rights, they are no longer needed or wanted, or if the bot is not actively used.

== Admin Bots ==

Some bots can be used along with administrative tools that will enable it to perform multiple page deletions, page protections, page reverts, User/IP blocks, or page undeletions in an automated way. While there are no strict rules as to how these tools may be used to help perform repetitive tasks, administrators should note that '''an admin-bot malfunction is indistinguishable from abuse. Admins are responsible for problems caused by their bots. Be extremely cautious about running automated tools for admin tasks.'''

Local administrators may occasionally need to perform a lot of actions at once in order to serve the community. Administrators may temporarily provide themselves with the '''[[Wikibooks:Pseudo-bots|pseudo-bot flag]]''' in order to prevent the RC feed from being flooded. Wikibookians who abuse or inappropriately use the pseudo-bot flag may have access to the administrative tools removed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Request for clarification &amp; question===
Hi Robert - was wondering if you could clarify:

''Good-faith efforts of new users should be guided, and perhaps a diligant Wikibookian who wants to help out can &quot;place&quot; a &quot;loose&quot; wikibook on a bookshelf if it is not on one in the first place. Generally this matieral is either going to be new user experiments or a violation of Wikibooks policies for other reasons, including link spamming and blatant vandalism or even offensive material with strong POV issues.''

Are you saying that if a book isn't placed on a bookshelf it is usually for nefarious reasons or because someone did is experimenting?  How about for newbies that just don't know how to get the book on the bookshelf or those that don't even understand the concept of the bookshelf?

Also, I'm curious as to books that have long standing stubs but have not been updated.  Can there be room for someone starting an idea but having to get extra time to recruit people to help - especially people on the outside of wikibooks?

Hmm, now that I think about it - what is the definition of a &quot;New Wikimedia project concept&quot;?  

And lastly, for the textbook vs. nontextbook argument - what if there is curriculum that is scripted for teachers to read and teach younger students (k-5) how to read, how to do arithmetic, or learn about science?

Thanks --[[User:Harriska2|Harriska2]] 16:41, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

''Transformational Leadership Theory''

While agreement among scholars of leadership theory is a scarce and precious commodity, scholars are in agreement that James McGregor Burns was responsible for conceptualizing leadership along an axis extending from transactional leadership to transformational leadership (Avolio, Bass, &amp; Jung, 1999; Bass, 1990; Daft, 2005; Rost, 1993).  Rost (1993), in his quintessential review of the definitions (or absence thereof) of leadership, quotes Burns’ view that transactional leadership occurs “when one or more persons engage with others in such a way that leaders and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality.”

''Key Concepts of the Theory''

A variety of scholars have elaborated upon this seminal definition in an effort to provide greater clarity and a clearer application of the theory.  We are told that this model of leadership explicitly embraces a moral code and value structure as followers are inspired to consider such laudable motives as justice, morality and peace (Landy &amp; Conte, 2004).  Pragmatism enters the mix as others tell us that this theory of leadership includes the motivation of the followers to exceed normally expected performance levels and to contribute more than they or the leader expect (Koehler, Wallbrown, &amp; Konnert, 1994).
Landy and Conte (2004) contribute a review of more recent writings by Bass and Avolio to further elaborate on transformational theory.  Of most significance is their review of the four general strategies that leaders use:

1.	Idealized influence: Leaders display conviction, emphasize trust, take stands on difficult issues, emphasize the importance of commitment and purpose, and are aware of the ethical consequences of their decisions.

2.	Inspirational motivation: Leaders articulate an appealing vision of the future, challenge followers with high standards, talk optimistically with enthusiasm, and provide encouragement and meaning for what needs to be done.

3.	Intellectual stimulation: Leaders question old assumptions, values and beliefs; stimulate new ways of doing things and encourage expression of ideas and reasons.

4.	Individualized consideration:  Leaders deal with others as individuals; consider individual needs, abilities, and aspirations; listen attentively; and advise, coach and teach. (p. 462)

''Relationship to Other Theories''

Burns’s work seems a reaction to a series of leadership theories which preceded his efforts but which were uniformly unsatisfying in their utility.  Landy and Conte’s (2004) review of the theories which preceded Burns is illustrative.  They report that the great man/woman theory and its cousin, the trait approach, proved fruitless, as little agreement was reached as to what the key traits were.   The Ohio State studies initiated the behavioral approach by introducing the oft used two factors of consideration and initiating structure behavior.  While this was an advance, the studies suffered from, among other issues, inconsistencies and potential biases.  The University of Michigan studies continued this two factor approach but added consideration of the leader’s interaction with the entire workgroup.  They tell us the contingency theorists contributed two intuitively satisfying models in Hersey and Blanchard’s Situational Theory and House’s Path-Goal theory.  Unfortunately, there is little convincing research evidence supporting these theories.
   
Landy and Conte (2004) go on to elaborate further, recounting Burns’ conceptualization of transactional and transformational leadership as occupying two ends of a spectrum in something of a zero sum game.  They explain for us that Burns believed that a leader who employed a high level of transactional strategies would, necessarily, employ a low level of transformational strategies and conversely.  They tell us that, in contrast, “Bass perceived transformational leadership as building upon transactional leadership in a hierarchy with respect to their effectiveness” (p. 462).

''Strength, Weaknesses and Key Contributions of the Theory''

Arguably, the most important strength of the transformational theory and its greatest contribution to the study of leadership is its demonstrated ability to explain and predict follower behaviors based on leader actions.  Bass’s contribution of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire instrument, which reliably measures transformational and transactional behavior, has enabled researchers to measure the impact of these behaviors on followers (Avolio, Bass, &amp; Jung, 1999).  As a result, there is a significant amount of empirical data supporting the efficacy of the theory.  One study of 3,204 members of the U.S. Army throughout the United States investigated the effects of officers’ transformational leadership behavior (Kane &amp; Tremble, 2000).  The investigators studied the transformational behavior of three levels of officers, Platoon Leaders (1st and 2nd Lieutenants), Company Commanders (Captains), and Battalion Commanders (Lieutenant Colonels) as they interacted with enlisted platoon members. The researchers report two significant findings.  First, in support of Bass’s concept of a transactional – transformational hierarchy, transformational behavior augmented the effects of transactional behaviors on the platoon members’ job motivation and moral commitment.  In addition, they reported an increase in the effectiveness of transformational leadership with an increase in the rank of the leader.  
Ethical issues, while always important, have become the focus of intense scrutiny and discussion as a result of the recent spate of corporate and political scandals.   Research is beginning to emerge which indicates that an additional, potential strength of the transformational theory is the contribution it can make toward improving the ethical climate of organizations.  One recently published study, for example, demonstrated that altruism positively influences transformational leadership and, in turn, transformational leadership has a demonstrably positive effect on the ethical climate of an organization (Engelbrecht, Aswegan, &amp; Theron, 2005).  The investigators concluded: “Transformational leaders can make a significant impact on the ethical performance of organisations [sic]” (p. 25).
Finally, empowerment of followers is essential to highly effective organizations.  Transactional leadership has been shown to have a positive impact on the empowerment of followers as a result of increased social identification, that is, identification with the organizational unit (Kark, Shamir, &amp; Chen, 2003).

Two significant weaknesses of this theory, both related to the strong personality possessed by many transactional leaders, are most apparent to this writer.  First, Kark et al. (2003) demonstrated not only the effect on empowerment of transformational leadership, but also demonstrated an increased level of follower dependency upon the leader.  This dependency is due to the increased identification with the leader caused by the leaders’ often charismatic behavior.  The researchers refer to Howell (1998) and assert that the personal identification with the leader may result in submission and unquestioning loyalty.  It seems clear that there is a risk that followers whose personal identification with the leader outweighs other factors may undertake actions they would find repellant without the impact of the leader.  “Consequently, if the leaders’ motives or ethical standards are poor, they can manipulate their loyal constituency” (Stone, Russell, &amp; Patterson, 2003 p.6).

Secondly, there is some evidence that transformational leaders lack staying power.  Collins (2001) makes a compelling case that organizations led by transformational leaders blossom and then wilt as the leaders move on or the external environment changes.  This view is congruent with the view held by several researchers that transformational leadership is more at home and, indeed, more appropriate in an environment that is dynamic and challenging if not threatening.  In this situation, the leader is highly motivated to emphasize the intellectual stimulation and inspiration of every member in order to preserve the organization (Smith, Montagno, &amp; Kuzmenko, 2004).  These researchers postulate that, as the organization moves to an environment and state that are more stable, the true transformational leader becomes less relevant. Servant leadership, reminiscent of Collins’ Level 5 Leadership, then becomes more effective.

''Applying Transformational Leadership within the Framework of the A-P-S Model''

Transformational leadership is most closely aligned with the servant leader paradigm contained within the A-P-S model (Laub, 2003).  Smith, Montagno, and Kuzmenko’s (2004) study indicated that “three of the four dimensions of transformational leadership exhibit a substantial match with the components of servant leadership” (p. 84).  They go on to indicate that servant leadership does not address the intellectual stimulation dimension of transformational leadership while transformational leadership is less concerned with valuing others.  Expanding on this comparison, Stone, et al. (2003) tell us quite definitively “The principal difference between transformational leadership and servant leadership is the focus of the leader” (p. 4).  Transformational leaders focus primarily on the goals of the organization while servant leaders focus first on their service to the followers.  This distinction, in combination with the contextual differences examined by Smith, et al. (2004) paints a picture of an effective leader modulating his behavior between transformational and servant leadership as the situation warrants.  As the organization faces urgent challenges and must move from a position of stability, transformational leadership, with its greater emphasis on organizational goals and intellectual stimulus would be used.  As the organization arrives at a new condition of stability, the behaviors would shift to those of the servant leader as the organization consolidates its gains and concentrates on operating most efficiently in the new state.

''Putting It Into Practice''

Given the realities of the current business climate, in which a short term perspective is all pervasive and codified standards of fiduciary duty require corporate officers, executives, and board members to put the interests of shareholders above all else, including employees, the application of servant leadership will be difficult in this type of organization.  Clearly, given the luxury of a long term view, the interests of the shareholders and employees will converge as they have at organizations such as Southwest Airlines.  Working in this environment, I can envision that the most practical route to success will involve using the precepts of transformational leadership to initiate change and begin an improvement process.  Once momentum is gained and, frankly, enough results are achieved to buy time, a shift to a more employee focused servant leadership mode will permit the gains to be consolidated and the organization to remain highly effective in a more stable environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Be aware that there is considerable controversy as to whether EI is a defensible concept.  Dr. Ludden is presenting a paper at the Midwest Scholar's Conference challenging the role of emotion, as opposed to cognition in leadership.  I am doing some lit review type of research for him and there are a number of articles that challenge EI based on the lack of of empirical evidence defining the concept, the lack of empirical evidence showing that it can be measured, and, finally, the lack of empirical evidence that there is any relationship between EI and leadership success. As I progress with the research, I will add details but for now, here is a list of references:

These guys are having an ongoing debate on the subject and Antonakis' stuff pretty much sums up the issue.  He doesn't pull any punches and as much as calls EI worthless and made up pop psychology!

'''Defining Characteristics of Constructionism'''

Adherents to the Constructionist tradition argue that, while some objective reality may exist, what we humans know as reality is actually our socially constructed perception of reality. This construction is, necessarily, filtered by the lenses of perception and culture. Shadish (as cited in Patton, 2002) makes an important point as he emphasizes that it is not reality itself that is constructed but our knowledge about reality that is socially constructed.

Burr’s volume on Social Constructionism (Burr, 2003) provides a useful definition as well as an overview of the major tenets of this tradition. He tells us:

1.	Constructionism embodies a critical stance toward that knowledge that is most typically taken for granted. This tradition challenges the assumption that knowledge is amassed through the unbiased and critical observation of the world around us. Constructionists argue that the true nature of reality cannot be understood by simple observation.

2.	Constructionism questions reality. This tradition allows no such thing as an objective fact.  All knowledge, it maintains, is derived from the observation of the world through some perspective and serves some interests rather than others. 

3.	Historical and cultural specificity impinge upon our observation of the world. All of our observations are relative, then, and depend on the particular cultural biases and historical perspectives that observers possess.

4.	Knowledge is not developed through neutral observation but through the interaction of individuals who, between them, construct a mutually agreed upon perception of reality. Social processes, then, sustain knowledge.
  
5.	These constructed perceptions are tied to power relations. The perceptions serve some interests rather than others and have implications for what is permissible for some people to do and for how they may treat others.
 
6.	Finally, Burr asserts that Constructionism embodies anti-essentialism. Because the social world is the product of social processes, there cannot be a given, determined nature to the world or people.  

'''The Foundations of this Tradition'''

Blumer, Kitsuse and Spector (as cited in Holstein &amp; Miller, 1993) appear to have laid the foundations for this tradition of analysis as they sought to encourage the serious study of social problems.  Blumer, in particular, (as cited in Holstein &amp; Miller, 1993) argued that  many malignant social conditions have existed over time but did not automatically become social problems, saying,

&quot;It is a gross mistake to assume that any kind of malignant or harmful social condition or arrangement in a society becomes automatically a social problem for that society. The pages of history are replete with instances of dire social conditions unnoticed and unattended in the societies in which they occurred.&quot; 

Thus, he argued that these conditions did not become problems until a group of individuals perceived them to be a problem. This collective definition of the problematic nature of a condition, or definition of perceived reality, was what social problems had in common. There was no objective definition of what constituted a problem.  This realization shifted the focus of research away from social conditions themselves and onto the process of collective definition and perception of reality developed by those experiencing the conditions. Thus, the social process of collectively defining a condition as problematic, that is defining the reality of the observers and participants, became the focus of study rather than the particular condition itself. Pursuing this line of reasoning, social scientists began to focus less on some theoretical, objective reality and more on the reality that was defined by a collective perception of the situation and how it was experienced by the observers. 

Thus, researchers began to understand that the reality of a phenomenon, say a treatment program, was really defined by the perceptions and experiences of those engaged in the program. The real issue to be studied became the way the participants viewed the program through the lenses of context and their personal histories and, therefore, how they engaged with the program. The specific objective realities of the program structure and methods became secondary to an understanding of this interaction and these perceptions.  The use of qualitative research methods supported this realization as researchers realized that interview responses, document surveys, and the like, reflected the collective perceptions, or constructions, of those participating in the research.  

'''Research Benefits of this Tradition'''

The use of the Constructionist approach recognizes that the true worth of any phenomenon under study, be it, for example, a treatment program or set of leadership activities is best reflected by the perceptions of those engaged in it. Indeed, we can argue that the effectiveness of such a program or set of activities is more directly correlated to the perceptions of the participants and their evaluation of the experience than to some more objective measures that are used to evaluate specific criteria of the program or activity. An example is in order here. Using the Organizational Leadership Assessment (Laub, 2004) in a traditional Asian organization would likely tell us that the organization is Autocratic or Paternalistic.  Absent other information, we would be tempted to conclude that the organization suffers from leadership issues and an inability to change. However, if we were to explore the organization using qualitative methods in the Constructionist tradition, we would endeavor to understand how the members of the organization viewed the leadership situation, that is, what their consensus of reality is when viewed through the lenses of context, culture and history. Given what we know of Asian cultural values and the tradition of paternalistic, family led organizations; we might very well evaluate the situation quite differently. The members may view the leadership as quite effective and acceptable. Which evaluation represents reality? Both do. However, the reality that gives us the best understanding of organizational effectiveness is likely to be that described by the qualitative/Constructionist methods. Leadership is effective when the led believe it is effective and it is this belief that can only be captured in Constructionist evaluations.
 
Thus, when we use the Constructionist tradition to research a situation and gather the perceptions of participants, we benefit from a richer understanding of the consensual evaluation of a situation and this evaluation may be a better indicator of effectiveness. 

'''Research Hindrances of this Tradition'''

As valuable as the Constructionist tradition is for its ability to assist in the understanding of consensus and social reality, it is not without problems. First, on a practical level, it is more difficult to carry out research in this tradition than using, for example, a quantitative approach. The interview, research, and analytic skills of the researcher must be more highly developed. The time and resources required are greater than those required to administer, for example, a survey instrument. Analysis of the data is likely to be more difficult and time consuming.  
On a theoretical level, other problems exist. While a properly conducted quantitative study can give us some objective evidence of the ability to generalize the results to other situations, this is absent from qualitative research carried out in the Constructionist tradition. The agreed upon reality discovered in a particular study may apply only to the situation under analysis. We are also faced with the difficulty of determining when the research is complete. Using Patton’s (2002) metaphor, a quantitative study is done when the snapshot is taken and the statistics tell us we have an adequate sample size.  Research undertaken in the Constructionist tradition, like all qualitative research, suffers from an inability to discern when the film is over. How does the researcher know that enough information has been collected? When has the observation continued for long enough to justify its discontinuance? Finally, and most importantly, we have seen that a reality constructed by consensus can serve the interests of some and disregard the interests of others.  Research that does not adequately seek out and include all the participants and stakeholders may be tainted by the agenda of one particular group at the expense of others and, therefore, may draw incomplete or inaccurate conclusions.

'''Critical Considerations When Reading Constructionist Research.''' 

When reviewing Constructionist research, the scholar must be cognizant of the potential deficiencies and disadvantages of this tradition of enquiry in particular and qualitative research in general. The scholar must:

1.	Determine to his satisfaction that all constituent groups acted upon by the treatment or other such situations are represented in the construction of the perceived reality.

2.	Be vigilant for specific agendas and interests that may be over-represented in the construction of reality that is presented.

3.	Gain an understanding of the duration of the research and satisfy himself that it is sufficiently long to record generalized and long-standing perceptions rather than perceptions that are influenced by transitory events.

4.	Understand and critically evaluate any claims of the ability to generalize the conclusions made by the author of the research, remembering that the constructed reality is the result of the perceptions of those specific individuals participating in the study. Only after the work is replicated with other constituent groups in other different but analogous situations should any consideration be given to assertions of generalizeability.

5.	Understand and evaluate any alterations to the described consensual reality that may arise as a result of the researcher’s own lenses of culture and history. The researcher will not be a detached individual observer and will, in virtually every case, apply her own perceptions to the “reality” being observed.

Black's move is a mistake. White should now play [[/4. e5/]], forcing Ng8 (4...Qe7 solves nothing because of 5. Qe2).

Blacks counter-attack leaves White with few options. White is almost forced to take the e pawn : [[/4. fxe5/]].

[[/4. d3/]] is hard to refute but it gives initiative to Black. This move is usually played to strengthen the center, but in this case, Black has many ways to break it down easily. The threat Qxd1 Kxd1 prevents Whites d pawn from protecting effectively the kings pawn. Also note that White f pawn is no longer protected by the e5 trap, because Black can reply with Ng4 or d4.

[[/4. exd5/]] is not advised since it will dramatically weaken Whites pawn structure (doubled pawns on d file and d5 pawn is en prise). In this case, Black should not immediately take back the d pawn with 4...Nxd5 but rather try to exploit the weakness in Whites pawn structure with 4...e4 or 4...exf4.

Le mur de l’inconnu…





Les mathématiques supérieures peuvent être beaucoup plus simples que les mathématiques élémentaires. En général, un théorème d’une grande généralité ne dit rien de compliqué ; il se borne à attirer l’attention sur des faits importants. Presque toutes les découvertes mathématiques reposent sur une idée plutôt simple.

										William Sawyer




La présente théorie est provisoire…

										Jean Schneider


« Les mathématiques ne portent que sur des idées : elles sont l’étude rigoureuse, systématique et idéalisés des structures formelles et des relations abstraites, ce qui suffirait à en faire la base obligée de toute construction théorique, quelle qu’elle soit. »

									Laurent-Michel Vacher

-	« Nul ne sait où sa vie s’arrêtera !
-	Qui peut connaître exactement ce qu’il ou elle sera demain ?
-	Connaître sa destinée peut parfois s’avérer périlleuse.
-	Pourquoi ?
-	Parce que l’inconnu stimule la vie. Il donne un sens à l’existence.
-	L’incertitude est remplie d’originalité.
-	Si vous connaissez exactement l’heure de votre mort, vous n’aurez plus le goût de combattre pour la vie.
-	Simplement, parce que votre être est programmé à vivre.
-	Être réellement maître de sa destinée consiste à franchir le mur de l’inconnu.
-	Il nous incite à craindre Dieu et à le respecter encore plus.

Par une merveilleuse fin de journée ensoleillée à la fin du mois de Juillet 2006, j’en profitais pour entreprendre ce que j’appelle une ballade intellectuelle dans le monde : mathématique. Tirant son origine sur deux bases géométriques dites paradoxales, j’aimerais vous exposer deux anciens théorèmes. 

1-) L’Espace-temps de la géométrie Euclidienne

2-) L’Espace-temps de la géométrie de Lorentz

Remontons un peu dans l’espace-temps du passé, si vous voulez bien, au 3e siècle avant Jésus-Christ dans une magnifique mégapole grecque nommée Alexandrie. Un grand mathématicien voyait le jour. Rapidement, il fut couronné de gloire et de succès grâce à sa géométrie dite Euclidienne. Son nom est: Euclide. 
Deux mille trois cent ans plus tard, la géométrie euclidienne consiste à définir quelques précisions géométriques simples et parfois complexes. 
La longueur, ou son carré, est toujours de valeur ou axée sur des quantités dites positives.

(∆ X exposant 2) + (∆ Y exposant 2) = (∆ X ‘ exposant 2) + (∆ Y’ exposant 2) ≥ 0

Cela ressemble à plusieurs types de formules applicables encore aujourd’hui à l’espace-temps courbe de Minkowski . Mais pour (3) trois dimensions seulement. Bref, notre géométrie à nous est semblable à la géométrie euclidienne ; expliquant ainsi la géométrie classique de notre Univers D’Einstein de Sitter. 
Poursuivons notre chemin sur la route historique de la géométrie, il faut remonter à la fin du 19e siècle de notre ère pour assister à la naissance d’une seconde géométrie, celle du célèbre Hendrick Antoon Lorentz. Il est né à Arnhem en 1853 et meurt à Haarlem en 1928. Sa géométrie voit le jour et c’est une géométrie à intervalle liant deux systèmes parallèles. Ainsi est né le carré de l’intervalle de la géométrie à quatre dimensions, la géométrie de Lorentz. 

(∆ t exposant 2) - (∆ X exposant 2) = (∆ t ‘ exposant 2) - (∆ X’ exposant 2) ≥  0
(∆ t exposant 2) - (∆ X exposant 2) = (∆ t ‘ exposant 2) - (∆ X’ exposant 2)  ≤ 0
(∆ t exposant 2) - (∆ X exposant 2) = (∆ t ‘ exposant 2) - (∆ X’ exposant 2) =  0  

Où les résultats peuvent être soit positif, soit négatif ou parfois nul. Une nouvelle ère en géométrie venait de naître. Les signes mathématiques (+, -, =) dépendent de celle des composantes du temps (4e dimension) ou d’espace qui prédomine.

Le mur de l’inconnu

Ainsi en géométrie de Lorentz, la ligne d’Univers courbée est parcourue dans le temps propre le plus court et s’applique parfaitement à notre monde à quatre (4) dimensions. Certains néophytes pourraient se poser cette question :-« Quelle différence y-a-t-il entre la géométrie euclidienne, et celle de Lorentz ? » La réponse est : l’accélération. Pour les visuels, voici les deux (2) graphiques illustrant les deux paradoxes géométriques :

Tension builds up. The Black knight begins to be threatening. White should react quickly.

The common mistake is to take immediately the Black knight with [[/5. Nxe4/]]. After 5...dxe4, White has too few options to pursue his development ; f3 square is under control, kings bishop is blocked and the d pawn cannot advance safely. Moreover, its going to be hard to defend the e5 pawn against Nc6. It looks possible to catch up with 6. d4 but it seems that Black has equalized.

[[/5. Nf3/]] looks like the most solid move. It defends the e5 pawn (who is quite fragile now that he is away from home) and secure the strategic d4 square. It also prevents Qh4+ threat.

[[/5. d3/]] is a good way to deal with the problem quickly. Blacks knight will have to retreat or, more likely, to be traded with Whites knight. White should be aware that Black can launch an aggressive attack with Bb4 and Qh4, sacrifying the knight, but preventing castling after 5...Bb4 6. dxe4 Qh4+ 7. Ke2 (7. g3 is bad because the White knight is pinned : 7...Qxe4+).

[[/5. Qf3/]] is supposed to allow Nxe4 (or to force Black to play Nxc3) while playing an active game. But after 5...Nc6, things get complicated : 6. Nxe4 Nd4 and White must now defend the c2 pawn to avoid the fork (7. Qd3 dxe4 8. Qxe4 is a trap because of 8...Bf5).

Note to reader: It is unavoidable for this algorithm that O(nm) time is used, but all of these implementations also use O(nm) storage. The astute reader will notice that only the previous column of the grid storing the dynamic state is ever actually used in computing the next column. Thus, these algorithm can be altered to have only an O(n) storage requirement. By reassigning array references between two 1D arrays, this can be done without copying the state data from one array to another. I may return later and update this page accordingly; for now, this optimization is left as an exercise to the reader.

For large n, faster algorithms based on rolling hashes exist that run in O(n log n) time and require O(n log n) storage.

== C# ==
===Length of Longest Substring===
Given two non-empty strings as parameters, this method will return the length of the longest substring common to both parameters.  A variant, below, returns the actual string.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public int LongestCommonSubstring(string str1, string str2)
{
	if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(str1) || String.IsNullOrEmpty(str2))
		return 0;

	int[,] num = new int[str1.Length, str2.Length];
	int maxlen = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i &lt; str1.Length; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j &lt; str2.Length; j++)
		{
			if (str1[i] != str2[j])
				num[i, j] = 0;
			else
			{
				if ((i == 0) || (j == 0))
					num[i, j] = 1;
				else
					num[i, j] = 1 + num[i - 1, j - 1];

				if (num[i, j] &gt; maxlen)
				{
					maxlen = num[i, j];
				}
			}
		}
	}
	return maxlen;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Retrieve the Longest Substring===
This example uses the '''out''' keyword to pass in a string reference which the method will set to a string containing the longest common substring.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;

public int LongestCommonSubstring(string str1, string str2, out string sequence)
{
	sequence = string.Empty;
	if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(str1) || String.IsNullOrEmpty(str2))
		return 0;

	int[,] num = new int[str1.Length, str2.Length];
	int maxlen = 0;
	int lastSubsBegin = 0;
	StringBuilder sequenceBuilder = new StringBuilder();

	for (int i = 0; i &lt; str1.Length; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j &lt; str2.Length; j++)
		{
			if (str1[i] != str2[j])
				num[i, j] = 0;
			else
			{
				if ((i == 0) || (j == 0))
					num[i, j] = 1;
				else
					num[i, j] = 1 + num[i - 1, j - 1];

				if (num[i, j] &gt; maxlen)
				{
					maxlen = num[i, j];
					int thisSubsBegin = i - num[i, j] + 1;
					if (lastSubsBegin == thisSubsBegin)
					{//if the current LCS is the same as the last time this block ran
						sequenceBuilder.Append(str1[i]);
					}
					else //this block resets the string builder if a different LCS is found
					{
						lastSubsBegin = thisSubsBegin;
						sequenceBuilder.Length = 0; //clear it
						sequenceBuilder.Append(str1.Substring(lastSubsBegin, (i + 1) - lastSubsBegin));
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
	sequence = sequenceBuilder.ToString();
	return maxlen;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The extra complexity in this method keeps the number of new String objects created to a minimum.  This is important in C# because, since strings are immutable: every time a string field is assigned to, the old string sits in memory until the garbage collector runs.  Therefore some effort was put into keeping the number of new strings low.

The algorithm might be simplified (left as an exercise to the reader) by tracking only the ''start'' position (in, say str1, or both str1 and str2) of the string, and leaving it to the caller to extract the string using this and the returned length.  Such a variant may prove more useful, too, as the actual locations in the subject strings would be identified.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;iostream&quot;

using namespace std;

char **A;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	int satir, sira=1;

	cin &gt;&gt; satir;

	A = new char *[satir];

	for(int i=0; i&lt;satir; i++)
		*(A+i)= new char [sira];

	for(int j=1; j&lt;=satir; j++)
		cin &gt;&gt; A[0][j];

	for(int j=1; j&lt;=satir; j++)
		cout &lt;&lt; A[0][j];

	cin &gt;&gt; sira;

	for(int i=1; i&lt;=sira; i++)
		cin &gt;&gt; A[i][0];

	for(int j=1; j&lt;=satir; j++)
		cout &lt;&lt; A[0][j];

	for(int i=1;i&lt;=sira;i++){
		for(int j=1; j&lt;=satir; j++){
			if(A[0][j]==A[i][0]){
				cout &lt;&lt; A[i][0];
			}
		}
	}

	return 0;
}

This algorithm uses no extra storage, but it runs in O(mnl) time.  The 2 strings to compare should be placed in WS-TEXT1 and WS-TEXT2, and their lengths placed in WS-LEN1 and WS-LEN2, respectively.  The output of this routine is MAX-LEN, the length of the largest common substring, WS-LOC1, the location within WS-TEXT1 where it starts, and WS-LOC2, the location within WS-TEXT2 where it starts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is intended as a Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) reference for individuals who already possess a firm understanding of [[Ordinary Differential Equations|ordinary differential equations]] and have at least a basic idea of what a [[General Mechanics/Partial Derivatives|partial derivative]] is.

'''This book is meant to be easily readable to engineers and scientists''' while still being (almost) interesting enough for mathematics students. Be advised that in-depth proofs of such matters as series convergence, uniqueness, and existence will not be given; this fact will appall some and elate others. This book is meant more toward solving or at the very least extracting information out of problems involving partial differential equations. The first few chapters are built to be especially simple to understand so that, say, the interested engineering undergraduate can benefit; however, later on important and more mathematical topics such as vector spaces will be introduced and '''used'''.

What follows is a quick intro for the uninitiated, with analogies to ordinary differential equations.

==What is a Partial Differential Equation?==

'''Ordinary differential equations''' (''ODEs'') arise naturally whenever a rate of change of some entity is known. This may be the rate of increase of a population, the rate of change of velocity, or maybe even the rate at which soldiers die on a battlefield. ODEs describe such changes of ''discrete entities''. Respectively, this may be the capita of a population, the velocity of a particle, or the size of a military force.

More than one entity may be described with more than one ODE. For example, cloth is very often simulated in computer graphics as a grid of particles interconnected by springs, with Newton's law (an ODE) applied to each &quot;cloth particle&quot;. In three dimensions, this would result in 3 second order ODEs written and solved for each particle.

'''Partial differential equations''' (''PDEs'') are analogous to ODEs in that they involve rates of change; however, they differ in that they treat ''continuous media''. For example, the cloth could just as well be considered to be some kind of continuous sheet. This approach would most likely lead to only 3 (maybe 4) partial differential equations, which would represent the entire continuous sheet, instead of a set of ODEs for each particle.

This '''continuum''' approach is a very different way of looking at things. It may or may not be favorable: in the case of cloth, the resulting PDE system would be too difficult to solve, and so the computer graphics industry goes with a particle based approach (but a prime counterexample is a fluid, which would be represented by a PDE system most of the time).&lt;BR&gt;
While PDEs may not be straightforward to solve on a computer, they have a major advantage over ODEs when applicable: it is nearly impossible to gain any analytical insight from a huge system of particles, while a relatively small PDE system can reveal much insight, even if it won't yield an analytic solution.

But PDEs don't strictly describe continuum mechanics. As with anything mathematical, they are what you make of them.

==The Character of Partial Differential Equations==

The solution of an ODE can be represented as a function of one variable. For example, the position of the Earth may be represented by coordinates with respect to, say, the sun, and each of these coordinates would be functions of time. Note that the effects of other celestial bodies would certainly affect the solution, but it would still be expressible strictly as a function of time.

The solution of a PDE will, in general, depend on more than one variable. An example is a vibrating string: the deflection of the string '''will depend both on time and which part of the string you're looking at'''.

The solution of an ODE is called a trajectory. It may be represented graphically by one or more curves. The solution of a PDE, however, could be a surface, a volume, or something else, depending on how many variables are involved and how they're interpreted.

In general, PDEs are complicated to solve. Concepts such as separation of variables or integral transformations tend to work very differently. One significant difficulty is that the solution of a PDE depends very strongly on the initial/boundary conditions (ICs/BCs). An ODE typically yields a general solution, which involves one or more constants which may be determined from one or more ICs/BCs. PDEs, however, do not easily yield such general solutions. A solution method that works for one initial boundary value problem (IBVP) may be useless for a different IBVP.

PDEs tend to be more difficult to solve numerically as well. Most of the time, an ODE can be expressed in terms of its highest order derivative, and can be solved on a computer very easily with knowledge of the ICs (boundary value problems are a little more complicated), using well established and more or less generally applicable methods, such as Runge Kutta (RK). With this in mind, an ODE may be solved quickly by entering the equation and its ICs/BCs into the right application and pressing the solve button. An IBVP for a PDE, however, will typically require its own specialized solution, and it may take much effort to make the solution more than, say, second order accurate.

==An Early Example==

Many of the concepts of the previous section may be summarized in this example. We won't deal with the PDE just yet.

Consider heat flow along a laterally insulated rod. In other words, the heat is only flowing along the rod but not into the surrounding air. Let's call the temperature of the rod &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;u = u(x, t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; represents the position along the rod. As the temperature depends both on time and position along the rod, this is exactly what &lt;math&gt;u = u(x, t)&lt;/math&gt; says. It is the change of the heat distribution over time. See the graphic below to get an idea.&lt;BR&gt;
Let's say that the rod has unitless length &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and that its '''initial''' temperature (again unitless) is known to be &lt;math&gt;u(x, 0) = \sin(\pi x)&lt;/math&gt;. This states the '''initial condition''', which depends on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The function is a simple hump between 0 and 1. Check for yourself with maxima (http://maxima.sourceforge.net or on android): plot2d(sin(x*%pi),[x,0,1])&lt;BR&gt;
Let's also say that the temperature is somehow fixed to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; at both ends of the rod, i.e. at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and at &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;. This would result in &lt;math&gt;u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which specifies '''boundary conditions'''. The BCs state that ''for all t'', &lt;math&gt;u = 0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

A PDE can be written to describe the situation. This and the IC/BCs form an initial boundary value problem (IBVP). The solution to this IBVP is (with a physical constant taken to be &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;):


:&lt;math&gt;u(x, t) = e^{-\pi^2 t}\sin(\pi x)\,&lt;/math&gt;


Note that:
:&lt;math&gt;u(x, 0) = e^{-\pi^2 0}\sin(\pi x) = \sin(\pi x) \qquad \mbox{(it satisfies the IC)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(0, t) = e^{-\pi^2 t}\sin(\pi \cdot 0) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(1, t) = e^{-\pi^2 t}\sin(\pi \cdot 1) = 0 \qquad \mbox{(it satisfies the BCs)} \,&lt;/math&gt;


It also satisfies the PDE, but (again) that'll come later.

This solution may be interpreted as a surface, it's shown in the figure below with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; going from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; going from &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;0.5&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the distribution of heat is changing over time as the heat flows and dissipates.

[[Image:PDEBook0000.jpg|frame|center|&lt;math&gt;u(x, t)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Surfaces may or may not be the best way to convey information, and in this case a possibly better way to draw the picture would be to graph &lt;math&gt;u(x, t)&lt;/math&gt; as a curve at several different choices of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, this is portrayed below.

[[Image:PDEBook0001.jpg|frame|center|&lt;math&gt;u(x, t)&lt;/math&gt; in the domain of interest for various interesting values of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.]]

PDEs are extremely diverse, and their ICs and BCs can radically affect their solution method. As a result, the best (read: easiest) way to learn is by looking at many different problems and how they're solved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parallel Plate Flow: Easy IC==

===Formulation===

As with ODEs, separation of variables is easy to understand and works well whenever it works. For ODEs, we use the substitution rule to allow antidifferentiation, but for PDEs it's a very different process involving letting dependencies pass through the partial derivatives.

A fluid mechanics example will be used.

Consider two plates parallel to each other of huge extent, separated by a distance of 1. Fluid is smoothly flowing between these two plates in only one direction (call it ''x''). This may be seen in the picture below.

[[Image:PDEBook0003.jpg|center|frame|Visualization of the parallel plate flow problem.]]

After some assumptions, the following PDE may be obtained to describe the fluid flow:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} - \frac{P_x}{\rho}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This linear PDE is the result of simplifying the Navier-Stokes equations, a large nonlinear PDE system which describes fluid flow. u is the velocity of the fluid in the ''x'' direction, ρ is the density of the fluid, ''ν'' is the kinematic viscosity (metaphorically speaking, how hard the molecules of the fluid rub against each other), and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the pressure gradient or pressure gradient vector field. Note that '''''u = u(y, t)''''', there is no dependence on ''x''. In other words, the state of the fluid upstream is no different from the state downstream. Notice that we do not consider turbulences and that the state of the flow varies between the upper plate and the lower plate as the speed ''u'' is 0 close to the plates.

''u''(''y'', ''t'') is a velocity profile. Fluid mechanics typically is concerned with velocity fields, contrary to rigid body mechanics in which the position of an object is what is important. In other words, with a rigid object all 'points' of the object move at the same speed. With a fluid we get a velocity field and each point is moving at its own speed.

The ratio ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ describes the driving force; it's a pressure change (gradient) along the ''x'' direction. If ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''negative'', then the pressure downstream (positive x) is smaller than the pressure upstream (negative ''x'') and the fluid will flow left to right, i.e., ''u''(''y'', ''t'') will generally be positive.

Now on to create a specific problem: let's say that a constant negative pressure gradient was applied for a long time, until the velocity profile was steady (steady means &quot;not changing with time&quot;). Then the pressure gradient is suddenly removed, and without this driving force the fluid will slow down and stop. That is the assumption we are going to use for our example calculations. We assume the flow to be steady and then decaying as the pressure (expressed as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ) is removed. Hence we can remove the term -''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;/ρ from our model as well, see (PDE) below.

[[Image:PDEBook0002.jpg|frame|Initial flow profile.]]

Let's say that before the pressure was removed, the velocity profile was ''u''(''y'', ''t'') = sin(''π'' ''y''). With velocity profile we mean, as the velocities are measured on a cross section of the flow, they form a hump. This would make sense: the friction dictates less motion near the plates (see next paragraph), so we could expect a maximum velocity near the centerline (''y'' = 1/2). This assumed profile isn't really correct, but will serve as an example for now. It's graphed at right in the domain of interest.

Before getting into the math, one more thing is needed: boundary conditions. In this case, the BC is called the '''no slip condition''', which states that the velocity of a fluid at a wall (boundary) is equal to the velocity of the wall. If we weren't making this assumption, the fluid would be moving like a rigid object. Since the velocities of the walls (or plates) in this problem are both zero, the velocity of the fluid must be zero at these two boundaries. The BCs are then ''u''(0, ''t'') = 0 (bottom plate) and ''u''(1, ''t'') = 0 (top plate).

The IBVP is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \qquad \mbox{(PDE)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) = \sin(\pi y) \qquad \mbox{(IC)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = 0 \qquad \mbox{(BCs)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the initial condition IC is the same hump from the first section of this book, just turned sideways. This IC implies that the flow is already flowing when we start our calculations. We are kind of calculating the decay of the flow speed.

===Separation===

Variables are separated the following way: we '''assume''' that &lt;math&gt;u(y, t) = Y(y)T(t)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''Y'' and ''T'' are (unknown) functions respectively of ''y'' and ''t''. This form is substituted into the PDE:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(u(y, t)) = \nu \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}(u(y, t))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;u(y, t) = Y(y)T(t)&lt;/math&gt; yields:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(Y(y)T(t)) = \nu \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}(Y(y)T(t))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Y(y) \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(T(t)) = \nu T(t) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}(Y(y))\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Y(y) T'(t) = \nu T(t) Y''(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)} = \frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Look carefully at the last equation: the left side of the equation depends strictly on ''t'', and the right side strictly on ''y'', ''and they are equal''. ''t'' may be varied independently of ''y'' and they'd still be equal, and ''y'' may be varied independently of ''t'' and they'd still be equal. '''This can only happen if both sides are constant'''. This may be shown as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d t} \left(\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)}\right) = \frac{d}{d t} \left(\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}\right)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{d t} \left(\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)}\right) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the derivative of both sides, turns the right-hand-side into a constant, 0. The left-hand-side is left as is. Then taking the integrals of both sides yields: 

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)} = \mbox{a constant}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Integration of the ordinary derivative recovers the left side but leaves the right side a constant. It follows by similarity that ''&lt;nowiki&gt;Y''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''/''Y'' is a constant as well.

The constant in question is called the separation constant. We could simply give it a letter, such as ''A'', but a good choice of the constant will make work easier later. In this case the best choice is -''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This will be justified later (but it should be reemphasized that it may be notated any way you want, assuming it can span the domain).

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)} = \frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -k^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\Big\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)} = -k^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -k^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The variables are now separated. The last two equations are two ODEs which may be solved independently (in fact, the ''Y'' equation is an eigenvalue problem), though they both contain an unknown constant. Note that ''ν'' was kept for the ''T'' equation. This choice makes the solution slightly easier, but is again completely arbitrary.

:&lt;!--math&gt;\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)} = -k^2 \Rightarrow T'(t) = -k^2 \nu T(t) \Rightarrow T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2 \nu t}\,&lt;/math--&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)} = -k^2\,&lt;/math&gt;
Rearrange and note that the notion buried in the expression below is that a function is equal to its own derivative, which kind of strikes the Euler number bell.
:&lt;math&gt;T'(t) = -k^2 \nu T(t)\,&lt;/math&gt;
Then solve.

:&lt;math&gt;
T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2 \nu t}\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Here is a solution plucked from Ted Woollett's 'Maxima by Example', Chapter 3, '3.2.3 Exact Solution Using desolve'. Maxima's output is not shown but should be easily reconcilable with what has been written.

:(%i1) de:(-%k^2*v*T(t))-('diff(T(t),t)) = 0;

:(%i2) gsoln:desolve(de,T(t));

The same goes for our right-hand-side.

:&lt;!--math&gt;\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -k^2 \Rightarrow Y''(y) = -k^2 Y(y) \Rightarrow Y(y) = C_2 \cos(k y) + C_3 \sin(k y)\,&lt;/math--&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)} = -k^2\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
Y''(y) = -k^2 Y(y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

And solve.

:&lt;math&gt;
Y(y) = C_2 \cos(k y) + C_3 \sin(k y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

In Maxima the solution goes like this. When Maxima is asking for 'zero' or 'nonzero' then type 'nonzero;':

:(%i1)de:(-%k^2*Y(y))-('diff(Y(y),y,2));

:(%i2)atvalue('diff(Y(y),y), y=0, Y(0)*%k )$ 

:(%i3)gsoln:desolve(de,Y(y));

The overall solution will be &lt;math&gt;u(y, t)&lt;/math&gt;, still with unknown constants, and as of now the product of ''Y'' and ''T''. So we are plugging the partial solutions for &lt;math&gt;Y(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T(t)&lt;/math&gt; back in:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = Y(y) T(t) = C_1 e^{-k^2 \nu t} (C_2 \cos(k y) + C_3 \sin(k y))
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = e^{-k^2 \nu t} (A \cos(k y) + B \sin(k y))
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has been multiplied into ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, reducing the number of arbitrary constants. Because an unknown constant multiplied by an unknown constant yields still an unknown constant.

The IC or BCs should now be applied. If the IC was applied first, coefficients would be equated and all of the constants would be determined. However, the BCs may or may not have been fulfilled (in this case they would, but you're not generally so lucky). So to be safe, the BCs will be applied first:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(0, t) = e^{-k^2 \nu t} (A \cos(k \cdot 0) + B \sin(k \cdot 0)) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A \cdot 1 + B \cdot 0 = 0 \Rightarrow A = 0 \qquad \mbox{(no slip along lower boundary)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

So ''A'' being zero eliminates the &lt;math&gt;\cos(k \cdot 0)&lt;/math&gt; term.

:&lt;math&gt;
u(1, t) = e^{-k^2 \nu t} B \sin(k \cdot 1) = 0\,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
B \sin(k \cdot 1) = 0 
\Rightarrow 
B = 0 \quad \mbox{or} \quad k = n \pi \qquad \mbox{(no slip along upper boundary)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

If we took ''B'' = 0, the solution would have just been ''u''(''y'', ''t'') = 0 (often called the trivial solution), which would satisfy the BCs and the PDE but couldn't possibly satisfy the IC. So, we take ''k'' = ''nπ'' instead, where n is any integer. After applying the BCs we have:

[[Image:PDEBook0006.jpg|frame|Decaying flow.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t} B \sin(n \pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Then we need to apply the IC to it. Per the IC from above &lt;math&gt;u(y, 0)&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, 0) = \sin(\pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Per the BC &lt;math&gt;u(y, 0) \mbox{with t = 0} &lt;/math&gt; is, see above. Setting those two definitions of &lt;math&gt;u(y, 0)&lt;/math&gt; equal is:

:&lt;math&gt;
e^0 B \sin(n \pi y) = \sin(\pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''t'' = 0 as per the IC assumption, &lt;math&gt;e^{-(n \pi)^2 \nu t}&lt;/math&gt; is becoming &lt;math&gt;e^0&lt;/math&gt;. The equality can only hold if ''B'' = 1 and ''n'' = 1, allowing us to simply remove those two constants from the function in its BC incarnation. That's it! The complete solution is:

:&lt;math&gt;
u(y, t) = e^{-\pi^2 \nu t} \sin(\pi y)\,
&lt;/math&gt;

It's worth verifying that the IC, BCs, and PDE are all satisfied by this. Also notice that the solution is a product of a function of t and a function of ''y''. The graph at the right is illustrating this. Observe that the profile is plotted for different values of ''νt'', rather than specifying some ''ν'' and graphing different values for ''t''. Remember that ''v'' is the kinematic viscosity. Hence the decay of flow speed also depends on it. Looking at the solution, ''t'' and ''ν'' appear only once and they're multiplying, so it's natural to do this. A dimensionless time could have been introduced from the beginning.

So what happens? The fluid starts with its initial profile and slows down exponentially. Note that with ''x'' replaced with ''y'' and ''t'' replaced with ''νt'', this is exactly the same as the result of heat flow in a rod as shown in the introduction. This is not a coincidence: the PDE for the rod describes diffusion of heat, the PDE for the parallel plates describes diffusion of momentum.

Take a second look at the separation constant, -''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The square is convenient, without it the solution for ''Y''(''y'') would have involved square roots. Without the negative sign, the solution would have involved exponentials instead of sinusoids, so the constant would have come out imaginary.

The assumption that ''u''(''y'', ''t'') = ''Y''(''y'')''T''(''t'') is justified by the physics of the problem: it would make sense that the profile would keep its general shape (due to ''Y''(''y'')), only it'd get flattened over time as the fluid slows down (due to ''T''(''t'')).

Quickly recap what we did. First we took a model PDE from Navier-Stokes and simplified it by making an assumption about the pressure being removed. Then we sort of first-stage solved it by separating ''Y'' and ''T''. Then we applied the BC (boundary conditions) and the IC (initial condition) yielding our final solution.

== Spam/External links user warning ==
Not sure if this is the correct place for this - there seem to be few talk pages in use in the templates generally.  Hopefully someone will notice and put me right if it isn't.

I noticed yesterday that someone had marked a page for speedy del because of blog spam and I've just marked another page with the same content and taken a link out of a template too.  I took a look at the user warning message to see if it was worth placing it.  However the current warning is very specifically directed to commercial links and I was wondering if the changing nature of the internet and links meant this should be reviewed?

A short while ago Wikipedia's equivalent was reviewed and changed due to this sort of thinking and currently reads

''&quot;Please do not add inappropriate external links to Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not a mere directory of links nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Inappropriate links include (but are not limited to) links to personal web sites, links to web sites that you are affiliated with, and links that exist to attract visitors to a web site or promote a product. See the external links guideline and spam policies for further explanations of links that are considered appropriate. If you feel the link should be added to the article, then please discuss it on the article's talk page rather than re-adding it. See the welcome page to learn more about Wikipedia. Thank you.&quot;''

Given this is Wiki'''books''' and the books are supposed to be &quot;all you need&quot; ''generally'' external links would seem inappropriate to me.  However others may well not agree but I have a feeling that this discussion probably will take place soon if not now.  Equally the other templates in this series may need review?  If it is appropriate/necessary I can open sub pages for the discussion for clarity or moved the dicussion to individual talk pages for the templates?  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:15, 28 October 2006 (UTC) &lt;small&gt;Moved from [[Wikibooks_talk:Template_messages/User_talk_namespace|this page]] by --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:I wouldn't say that ''all external links are inappropriate here'', but I would say that links to private blogs are inappropriate. A book might be &quot;all you really need&quot;, but every book contains lists of references, or places to find further information on the given topics. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:47, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

::Sort of my point - the current template only states commercial stuff is not wanted - blogs would not really come under that heading - hence the suggestion --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 21:02, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

:::I generally consider link to blogs and forums to be commercial. In general, I think external links should be used as references... if the page linked to was not used as a source for the content of a module, it probably doesn't belong there. 
:::Occaisionally one finds pages that are nothing but links to source materials, but if research is the goal of a book, it really should be on wikiversity, not wikibooks. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:57, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::::Again in a sense this is my point.  The &quot;commercial&quot; sites of the current Wikibooks warning seems inappropriate and a little restricted for the way the internet is changing.  If the wording said &quot;external links&quot; Wikibooks would have more flexibility in determining what was appropriate for it? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:12, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

I don't agree, for instance the [[C++ Programming]] book (and probably others), does make reference to external resources, software, references and repositories of information, forums, IRC channels etc... that directly, did not serve as source material or is even directly referenced on a book chapter and some are commercial or have products for sale...

But write up draft policy and we can tweak it to avoid the real spam.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:38, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:I don't think we need to write any additional policy on this matter, people should use their own judgement when dealing with links of this type. In general, I think that if an external entity benefits from including a link here, that needs to be considered &quot;commercial&quot;. Now, if wikibooks also benefits from the link, things are fine. If wikibooks doesnt benefit from the link, it is considered spam, and should be deleted. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

::This is not about policy, this is about warning templates for user talk pages so that RC patrollers (or others) can place appropriate warnings on talk pages and anyone checking (admin etc) can see the history.  As such stating &quot;commercial links&quot; allows people wriggle room to say the links they are placing aren't commercial.  Stating &quot;external links&quot; means they can't wriggle.  It is still up to Wikibooks to decide what type of links it is prepared to allow (&amp; I'm with [[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]'s comment on that.
::While I'm here I'd ask that we consider bringing in a &quot;spam-im&quot; template (as Wikipedia) which is the spam equivalent of the blatant vandal one - their's is currently

:::We really just don't have a policy for backing that up. If a user is posting a bunch of unneeded links all about the place, they'll be blocked as vandals, though it probably depends which admin is looking at the problem. Personally I wouldn't necessarily block someone for adding 2 links, unless thay were linking hard-core porn on wikijunior or something like that. As a rule, someone just randomly adding links to books they don't otherwise edit is certainly suspicious, but I think the vandalism rules do the job just fine: pasting glossy ads for bob's pizza on the pages of a library book isn't much different from drawing on the pages of a library book.
:::In general, we don't have the kind of spamming here that exists on wikipedia, in part because we're not as high on the google rating, in part because of the structure of wikibooks (we're not going to necessarily have material on widgets, gadgets ''and'' gizmos, and even if we did, they'd be hidden away in chapters and cubchapters somewhere), and in part because we have a smaller audience. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:59, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

::I disagree pretty strongly, I dont think we need to draft a separate proposal, when we can consider excess spam as vandalism. Leave it up to the judgement of the people looking at it. Some external links are appropriate and do not constitute linkspam. I would say it mostly has to do with the subject matter of the page the link appears on, and the relevance of the link. We should not, under any circumstances, restrict the addition of all external links. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:03, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

-Reset Ident.

I don't see anything to disagree, a policy on this point would remove the need to pass personal judgments (and use a subjective interpretation) on punctual events and users would have something to guide them on the use of links at Wikibooks (and other spam as it is defined) this would not prevent the addition of all external links (nor does it intends to) but reduce the cases and provide a page we can point at as a definition in case of disputes or as action is taken on the subject. Even reduce the work needed to inform the offending editor of what he did wrong and why.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:28, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:Again I am with [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] - my version of acceptable links will be quite different to other editors - some standards are necessary to avoid contributors confusion.  I see in some Coobook pages &quot;where to buy&quot; links.  To me these are unacceptable.  I've seen another editor removed blog links and yet plenty of them exist too.

== Policy of the week: codifying templates ==

I'd like to get some discussion on certain templates used for new page patrolling, chapter and book merges, etc., in the hopes of smoothing out these processes. 

First, [[User:Darklama]] has been doing some really interesting experiments with time-sensitive templating, and I'd be interested to see what people thing about adjusting the &quot;qr&quot; templates to use this technology. What the change would do is automagically add a queried page to [[:Category:Candidates for speedy deletion]] after a certain number of days have passed since the last time the page was edited. This would make the template more useful, since it could be used to mark up particularly stubby stubs (which are hopefully on the watchlists of the stubs' creators). 

The point of the qr tags is to have some middle ground between {{tl|delete}} and {{tl|vfd}} which gives the author a chance to build up the page a bit, without having to go through the arduous and/or bitter process of a VfD discussion. By making the template automagic, the process would now have a beginning and end, since after 7 or 14 days without further edits, the page would just become a candidate for speedy. 

Second, I'm going to make a template for marking obvious &quot;wikipedia dumps&quot;, which were copied here without contribution histories. Now that we have the import tool, we shouldn't be allowing this to happen anymore, since it's bad news as far as copyrights go. A few of us have been working on [[Wikibooks:Transwiki Rules]], which probably needs to be split soon into &quot;Transwiki Policy&quot; and &quot;Help:Transwiki&quot;. One of the policy points should be to simply ban copy-paste transwikis in favor of import. 

Third, we need to work up some policy about page mergers and tags for them. Over the past several weeks there have been a lot of mergers in certain areas (such as the C++ books), and the pages that were merged ''from'' should be marked as &quot;now merged into&quot;, so that the edit histories can be merged into the destination page (again, a copyright issue). It's actually very easy for an admin to do history mergers, so it's much better to have a template that marks pages as needing history merges, rather than marking them for speedy deletion. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:00, 28 October 2006 (UTC)

:OK, in the absense of other comments I think that the qr template is very good indeed.  It allows a compromise (as said above) between speedy and VfD - I feel this should be a proper template. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:05, 29 October 2006 (UTC)

==GOOFED UP SEARCH TOOL on international Wikibooks page==
When www.wikibooks.org is typed in and one comes to the page with the logo surrouned by the modules in different languages, if &quot;mathematics&quot; or &quot;art&quot; is typed into the search function at the bottom of the page, the user is redirected to Wikipedia!

== [[Wikibooks talk:Profanity]] ==

I would like to move this proposal to {{tl|policy}} soon, if there are no specific objections. One objection that has come up previously was to change the word &quot;Profanity&quot; to some other word, such as &quot;obscenity&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot;. I have been against the term &quot;offensive&quot;, because I feel that it is an arbitrary word, and that small minority groups of people could declare one thing to be &quot;offensive&quot; when it really isn't in general. [[User:Swift]], however, feels that both &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;profane&quot; terms are too specific, and that they carry particular connotations that aren't desirable for our use here. [[User:Swift]] prefers &quot;offensive&quot; as a blanket term. I would also like to point out that wikipedia uses the word &quot;profanity&quot; in it's policy: [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Profanity]].

I would like to get some community discussion on this matter. Wikibookians have typically been against profanity in usernames and page names in the past, so this proposal wouldn't actually change the status-quo here, it would only make the de facto things that we have been doing in the past a formal part of our policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:42, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

: Nice suggestions but what exactly is 'obscene' and 'offensive'?  Words are very powerful weapons and even something that's not considered to be 'obscene' or 'offensive' could cause offense.  Page names should only contain possibly offensive words if it's immediately relevent to the subject of the page.  User names should not be offensive or ambiguous (with several possible meanings of looking too similar to existing user names).  I have no problem with profanity unless it causes offense to an individual or group of people.  Either way, obscene is probably the best words to use but it should be defined clearly in whatever way is agreed. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 21:08, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

: I don't like the thought of a policy, censorship isn't ever good.  I think that we should recommend that profanity and offensive language not be used unless necessary and if someone happens to run accross some unneeded profanity ask the author to change it.  I do agree with the policy of nothing offensive directed directly towards a person or group. [[User:71.227.40.127|71.227.40.127]] 15:43, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

::I don't think anybody want's censorship, but there is a difference between profanity that is used in an academic way (which should be perfectly acceptable), and profanity that is used excessively, and with intent to disrupt. The idea behind this policy is not censorship, but instead it is an attempt to make wikibooks hospitable, and acceptable for readers from many age-groups and backgrounds. 
::These types of words and phrases can be harmful to some groups of people, so we do need some kind of policy to ensure that one group of people cannot verbally persecute other groups of people on wikibooks. However, we also need to ensure that one small minority cannot declare certain topics to be &quot;offensive&quot;, at the expense of acceptable information here on wikibooks. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:38, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]] and &quot;narrative media&quot; ==

In response to a comment on [[WB:VFD]], I have added some additional text to the [[Wikibooks:Annotated text|annotated text guidelines proposal]]. The new text allows for the inclusion of annotated versions of other narrative media including:

*Books (always included)
*Videos, TV Shows, and motion pictures
*Songs and musical albums
*Narrative videogames (not strategy guides!)
*Comic books

The idea behind this is that it ''is possible'' to discuss academically these topics from pop culture, and it is also possible to produce a &quot;companion guide&quot; to help further understand such peices. Here are some things that I think can be included:

*Companion annotations to videogames. These guides can include information about the fictional universe of the game, information about characters, explanation and analysis of the plot, etc. Notice that this is ''not a strategy guide for the game'', and such annotated texts should probably not discuss game-strategy or techniques at all. Also, some videogames are simply not conducive to such annotations (&quot;Contra&quot; is a good example), but some games probably are (&quot;Half Life&quot;, or &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;).
*Companion annotations to songs and musical albums. These guides can include information on the history of the band and biographies of the band members. It can also include a listing of the song lyrics, along with necessary discussion and analysis of the lyrics to improve reader understanding. Also, songs have musical characteristics besides the lyrics that can be creative and which could be explained for the reader. These should not be listings of lyrics and a promotion of the band (&quot;Led Zeppelin Totally Rocks!!!&quot;)

I would like to get some comments on this, because I feel like this will go a long way to help separate some things that don't belong here. Also, I think this will help to answer some questions about how video-game related topics can be made to fit into the wikibooks environment. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:07, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

:: Good work. It'll be good to have a clear policy about video games.  I can see the usefulness of some &quot;guides&quot; or &quot;companions&quot; but the majority of what we've been seeing recently are just strategy guides.  Is there any way of getting this useful information to the authors 'before' they write their page to save on having to delete it later? [[User:Xania|Xania]] 21:03, 31 October 2006 (UTC)

:::The majority of the video-game related books that we do have are strategy guides, not annotated texts, and therefore should be deleted.

Is there a clear distinction between orginal research compared with annotated text? Is orginal research allowed if it in the form of annotated text or includes annotated text? This proposed policy, along with the [[Wikibooks:Original research]] proposed policy, seem to be be at ends with each other. Perhaps both proposals need to be merged as one? That or clarification is needed. I don't really understand either proposal. I also don't understand where if one exists the line is drawn between what books do and don't belong here to well. I assume other people have simlar problems since lots of the same types of books keep coming up for Votes for Deletion. [[Wikibooks:Textbooks]], [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and [[Wikibooks:Inclusion criteria/Proposal]] also seem like attempts to clarify and explain what does and doesn't belong dividing people's efforts to explain even further. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 00:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:The two i think are completely different subjects. The Original Research guidelines simply prohibit using wikibooks as a forum for developing new ideas. The annotated guideline attempts to show how to make an annotated text acceptable. Annotated texts are not automatically &quot;original research&quot;, nor are they more susceptable to becoming so then any other type of book. An annotated text is essentially a &quot;learning companion&quot; book, or a book that you read at the same time as you read another book, in order to get more enjoyment/information/understanding from the other book. All I've done here is extend the definition to include other non-book media as acceptable sources for annotated texts. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

::Begining of [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]] states ''An annotated text contains two elements: 1. An original primary source text'' and [[Wikibooks:Original research]] says ''Original research refers to &quot;unproven facts&quot; or &quot;theories that have not been subject to peer review&quot;''. This suggests to me that the two are about the same subject or at least overlap, &quot;orginal text&quot; is text that has not been &quot;peer reviewed &quot; and may contain &quot;unproven facts&quot; right? Of course by submiting contents here it will probably end up being &quot;peer reviewed&quot; and facts corrected. BTW I wasn't trying to suggest annontated texts are automatically original research, just that my interpretation and understanding of the proposals as they are now suggest that they may indeed be the same thing some times. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:22, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:::No, no. I think you are misreading (or at least misinterpreting) the text of the annotated texts proposal. The &quot;original source texts&quot; are previously-existing written works, such as existing fiction novels, or other existing books. For instance, the [[William Shakespear's Works]] book includes the original plays and sonnets written by shakespear, in addition to explanatory text ''about the plays and sonnets''. In this sense, &quot;original&quot; doesnt mean &quot;new&quot;, but instead refers to &quot;prexisting versions written by the original author&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:55, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

::::Ok. So maybe the proposal could be improved to make clearer this distinction then? Such as by either removing the use of the word &quot;original&quot; or by defining what &quot;original&quot; means in terms of the annotated texts proposal. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 03:48, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

== Template double inclusion ==

I found something that I don't know about templates, so i might as well ask here. I have a situation where I have navigation templates included on every page in a book. I am then transcluding all the pages from the book into the print version. What I would like would be to not have the navigation templates included in the print version. I tried using:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifeq: {{SUBPAGENAME}} | Print version | | ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
And that worked fine for a while, but now I have multiple print versions for the book, and they all can't be named the same thing (unless i use a terribly complicated hierarchical naming scheme, which I am trying to avoid). Is there any way that I can have a template include itself once, but not include itself when it's host page is transcluded? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:50, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

:Also, I have tried using the format:
:: &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt; ... &lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:Maybe you could use a mix of &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and subst to delay substition until inclusion inside the template and so you end up with something like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifeq:{{&lt;includeonly&gt;subst:&lt;/includeonly&gt;SUBPAGENAME}}|{{SUBPAGENAME}}| ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The idea to cause SUBPAGENAME to get replaced with a fixed name by using subst but delay it until after inclusion for it to happen and then compare it to SUBPAGENAME again but this one not remaining constant. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 23:41, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
::The &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noprint&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; directive will cause the template not to print, but that will not prevent the templates from showing up on the print version, and it also doesnt stop the templates from appearing when I convert the print version to PDF format. I'll try darklama's idea now (because it's so crazy it just might work!). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:02, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

::Nope, Darklama's idea doesn't work. The problem is that in the double-inclusion, both the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; variables will evaluate to be the same thing (the name of the second page it's included in). I think what i'm going to have to do is change the page names to all have the same SUBPAGENAME (&quot;Print version&quot;), and use a hierarchical naming scheme to separate out the pages. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:32, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Ok apparently for this to work (I just tested it in my User space) you will need to subst the template so you will need at least another layer of difference between the navigation template. So you can in the navigation template to do something like &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:template}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. If your interested in seeing what I mean check out Template/nodouble, Template/nodouble/test and Template/nodouble/test2, in my userspace. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 03:11, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Allowing quizzes? ==

Hello,

I was thinking it would be really useful for Wikibooks to have an extension that allowed the easy creation of quizzes. This would work really well for language textbooks, as well as many others I imagine.

A [[m:Quizzes]] extension exists, but it might need more work before the developers would consider installing it here. You can see an example quiz [http://www.chekmate.org/wiki/quizes/quiz.php here] (unfortunately you will need to create an account first). It's very easy to use, multiple choice leading from Q to Q, and at the end it gives you a summary of which ones you got right and wrong. (I think I would prefer to know the result straight away after each question, but I guess it's a matter of personal preference.)

Anyway, has anything like this been proposed before? Does anyone else think it would be a good idea? --[[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 08:51, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Block is different ==

Block now has the option &quot;Automatically block IP addresses used by this user&quot;. Anyone know what this is about? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:22, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:As best I can tell, it will enable us to put an IP block on a signed-in vandal. So if a vandal is signed in, and we block with this option, the IP address that the vandal was using (which is normally only visible to a checkuser) get's blocked as well. Also, that block extends to ''all IP addresses'' that have been used by the same user. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:44, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:As a note to all admins, you should only use this option in the case of the most severe sockpuppet vandals only, because it has the potential to block multiple IP addresses. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:44, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about this. Does this block ''all'' accounts using a particular IP? Does it let us know which IP? What happens if someone gets collaterally blocked, and we can't tell what IP was blocked? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:11, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

== CommonsTicker? ==

Do we want one? It's kind of like a project watchlist, keeping track of changes to commons files that are used on wikibooks.

[[m:CommonsTicker]]

:I would have to look through the SL archives, but somebody did propose to get a commons ticker previously, but the deal never went through. I think the user who proposed it became inactive. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:46, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Other opinions please ==

Browsing round I came across quite an organised start of a book - [[Free Direct Instruction Curriculum and Training]].  The word &quot;free&quot; always worries me so I looked at little further.  There are a lot of links to what is and isn't copyright in the world.  It looks almost too polished?

== Untagged images ==

In September, 2006 it was discovered that Wikibooks has somewhere over 3,000 images without licence tags. We [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=-img_timestamp&amp;max=500&amp;ofs=0&amp;max=1000 probably have even more now]. 

Hosting these images on our server without licence tags violates our copyrights.

I'd like to propose the following remedy:

1. Alter the css so that the following message appears on every wikibooks page:

:'''Notice:''' if you have downloaded images to wikibooks in the past, please [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=-num&amp;max=1000&amp;grouped=on&amp;ofs=0&amp;max=500 check this page] to make sure none of them are listed as having no licence information. Any page loaded before November 1, 2006 that does not have a licence tag will be deleted without further warning.

2. Start deleting in 7 days, possibly requesting a steward to help if someone has a bot.

--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:17, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with you, the legal problems that these unlicensed images cause are dangerous. I would suggest, perhaps, a different wording of the warning (to be less verbose):
::'''Warning:''' All unlicensed images uploaded to wikibooks before November 1, 2006 are going to be deleted. Please see [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/UntaggedImages.php?wikifam=.wikibooks.org&amp;wikilang=en&amp;order=-num&amp;max=1000&amp;grouped=on&amp;ofs=0&amp;max=500 the list of unlicensed images] for information about what images will be deleted. 
:Beyond that, i think it's a good idea, and we definately need to do something about this problem (I'm going to go back through my records, and ensure that all the images that i've uploaded are tagged). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:42, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:I say you post the message soon (or now, if you want), and then we can take a little bit of time with sorting out the details. The images have been here for a while now, and I don't think it is a matter that we should rush unnecessarily. Once we post the message, we can probably take about 2-3 weeks before we finally delete everything (which will also give us time to find a bot that can do the whole process). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:52, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== why, for the love of God.... ==

Why are the books on these pages so badly formatted? Why can we not have a &quot;one big html-page&quot; format for those who would like to save the book for offline work. This makes for much easier searches within one's browser. Seriously!! I have tried to use wget to retrieve, only to find that the servers refuse to allow me to download pages . When I try to save manually from within my browser, I lose images that are integral to understanding the topics.

:Sounds like a browser problem to me, I can (and have) used wget and my web browser to download entire books before. Also, when the entire content of a book is included in a single page, we call that a &quot;print version&quot;. Some books have them, some do not. If you find a book that does not have a print version, and you would like it to have one, you are more then welcome (infact encouraged) to write it yourself. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:50, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== [[Remote Viewing/Pr02]] ==

Just marked as a speedy - soapbox type.  However I am pretty sure I've marked it so recently and it has been deleted (no time to look at logs) so maybe delete, create, protect?

== [[Wikibooks:WikiProject:Image Cleanup]] ==

We are trying to start an initiative to delete all the old, unlicensed images that have been uploaded to wikibooks. It is against our copyright policy to host unlicensed images on this server, and technically we should have been deleting these images all along. However, we haven't had the manpower to properly patrol all the old unlicensed images, and now we have ''over 3000 of them'' that need to be dealt with.

Therefore, we have enlisted the help of some bots, especially from users on commons who have dealt with this kind of problem before. Hopefully, by the end of the month we will be able to delete all these old images. Here is a list of the users with the most untagged images:

 309 Riaan 
 294 Barsathi 
 98 Karl Wick 
 88 Mkn 
 78 Norman Weiner 
 69 Leptictidium 
 53 Jimregan 
 44 Marshman 
 34 Flonejek 
 32 Wanderer 
 31 H Padleckas 
 31 Ldog187 
 29 Bootaleg 
 29 FerKo 
 28 Mrich 
 27 Abc123 
 27 Filare 
 27 Osxrules 
 25 Antme 
 25 Spiderworm 
 24 Henrikmk 
 24 Get-back-world-respect 
 24 Patrik 
 24 Llvoklojl 
 23 Deviance99 
 22 1983 
 22 Magnus Manske 
 21 Robbyjo 
 21 JR 
 20 Alex S 
 20 Kashkhan 
 20 Perl 
 20 Totophe64

We will do what we can to help, but '''unlicensed images will be deleted from wikibooks starting at the end of this month'''. There will probably not be any further warnings on this subject. I personally have a bot that can mass-tag images if you would like, and there are other bots in existance as well that can help with this, if you have alot of images that need to be tagged. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:59, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

I would like to move to make the image use policy official. I've read this proposal over again tonight, and there is nothing in this proposal that is different from the way we currently handle images. I know there is some talk that we should make some changes, but until we do get around to making changes, we should still have a valid policy on the books about how we deal with images. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:53, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

== Views on rules on editing books ==

I came across [[Democracy Project]].  It states that ''Contributors to the Democracy Project's Open Source Consititution can only make changes if they are allowed the right to vote at the time of their visit to the Project.''

I guess this is not enforceable in a virtual world but the spirit strikes me as a bit adrift and could lead to argument? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

:I think it may be trying to restrict who can edit beyond what the GFDL allows, which I'm sure isn't allowed here. After looking at the page, it also seems to be suggestings it may involve a theoritical experment in an area that is original research which I also don't think is accepted here. However it has only been here since yesterday, so it may be better to give it time and to {{tl|welcome}} him or her and try to point him or her in the right direction, rather then condimming the book and biting the new user. I'll go do the welcoming bit right now. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 14:42, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

::Sorry, [[User:Darklama|darklama]] they are restricting Wikibooks functions not the GFDL, even if that part of the text does not get any protection from the GFDL it doesn't break it (but it is clear that the author doesn't understand the license), I'll go a step further and will alter that line.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:32, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

::::Hi [[User:Darklama|darklama]] and [[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]]. Not sure if I added your names correctly, as I just began using Wikibooks yesterday. What I've proposed with the Democracy Project is a living artistic experiment that explores what would happen to the US Constitution were it open to change by all rather than legislation by just a few. However, as you know, in the original Constitition the right to vote was limited. Therefore, I felt it made sense to begin the Open Source Constitution in similar fashion. However, &lt;b&gt;I would personally like to see all people be able to update and refine the Open Source Constitution over time. So I invite either of you to jump in and edit the portion of the Open Source Constitution that restricts voting rights.&lt;/b&gt; Altering that text will effectively achieve the same result as changing the text in the introduction and would further the objective of the Democracy Project experiment. If either of you know how to place this Wikibook on the modern art bookshelf (or performance art bookshelf), I'd appreciate that as well. Have a nice day! And thanks for being the first to participate in the Democracy Project.--[[User:Mchogan|Mchogan]] 08:20, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

==  Who are the final arbiters of Wikibooks content  ==

I hope the audience reading this will be wider than I think but I'm guessing it will consist of (active) admins plus a handful of users who are interested beyond the bounds of their specialist book(s).  Over the past week on RC patrol (&amp; on the evidence of reverts I have been the only regular one reviewing changes) I have become familiar with a far wider range of wikibooks and their authors.  This has given me some feel for what is going on on a day to day basis as I have followed a number of edits (rather than merely previewing them) and then followed some links.  I am unsure how many of the staff here (anyone who is following this I count as &quot;staff&quot;) are aware of the content of some books.

I now find that it is suggested that the editors of the books be asked about the content (yes I am referring to links but not solely that).  The editor will consider their work ok by and large - if they don't they would probably not have contributed it.  For marked duff stuff (copyvio, speedy's) it gets the attention of an admin.  For VfD it gets &quot;staff&quot; approval or rejection (I'm guessing VfD is watched by the same people who watch this!).

Personally I think WB's policy to avoid policies is endearing (I like this place for a number of reasons and to me the &quot;casualness&quot; is better than WP's rather formal approach) but unrealistic.  However I do feel that review by staff of difficult issues (whatever they are) is a good approach.  I guess something similar to VfD to allow passing editors to bring their concerns to a wider body seems worthwhile to me - and we will all learn from it and hopefully make Wikibooks even better.

Examples I hear you cry - ok there are a number of pages about &quot;social skills&quot;, the vast majority contain no links so why does this one [[Guide to Social Activity/Courtship#External Links]].  It's been marked for &quot;cleanup&quot; and &quot;to do&quot; for a considerable time but other than IPs adding links very little has happened.  Another one I came across yesterday was [[Blender 3D/Tutorial Links List]].  You cannot convince me that offering such an array of links can possibly serve the reader well - a google link/a dmoz link/6 or so - fine - but all these?

On a &quot;safety&quot; note.  In my time with the Spam project at WP I tested virtually every link I removed.  I surf using FF, No Script extension, McAfee site Advisor and a fairly well filled HOSTS file - some site are genuinely undesirable &amp; I believe we owe it to more naive readers to ensure (as far as possible) that the links are at least as harmless as possible.  Thanks for the attention - I'll keep quiet for a bit &lt;g&gt; --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:13, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

:I'm going to start by go with trying to answer your topic question, with what I think the answer is. Arbiters don't come into play unless there is a dispute and even then should be avoided. In most cases the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]] should be used. &quot;High impact&quot; decisions are the only exception in which a formal vote is needed and in which case the Wikibooks community acts as the arbiters. I think avoiding a &quot;high impact&quot; decision can be reached by [[Wikibooks:Be bold|being bold]] and just deleting the inapproperiate links if you don't think they should be there and if someone disagrees they will add them back. I believe [[Wikibooks:assume good faith|assuming good faith]] is also an important part of any decision made to delete links, rather then assuming bad faith and deleting all links until someone can justify it which seems to be the WP way of thinking. (If you can't tell, I'm not a wikipedian) --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 15:31, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

:Excellent comments herby, i'll see what I can do to answer them. First off, you have hit a nail on the head, albeit in a circuitous way: if, for the past week you have been the only person following the RC list, that's likely because you are, in fact, the only active wikibookian who has the time/motivation/energy to do it. Wikibooks is nothing like wikipedia, a fact that is good in some cases, and bad in others. Unlike wikipedia, for instance, we simply don't have a large population, and we have very little sense of &quot;wikibooks community&quot;. Because of the lack of community, people tend to come to wikibooks when they want to make specific contributions to specific books, and they tend not to come at all otherwise. Because there is no community, and because there is no vested interest in the greater good of the project, people typically don't concern themselves with anything outside the scope of their own pet projects. To this end also, many people will watch their own books for obvious vandalism, but only a select few people concern themselves with vandalism or nonsense on a larger scale. Even I find myself spending more time working on my own books then I do working to improve the project at large. 
:On wikipedia, there are all kinds of people: some who are writing new content, some who are editing old content, some who are making modules conform to style, some who are monitoring for vandalism, some who are checking for linkspam, etc. Because the population of wikipedia is so large, people who are performing the same kinds of tasks can easily group together into &quot;Projects&quot;, so that like-minded people can help each other, and reinforce themselves. On wikibooks, we simply don't have that. There aren't many people who are working on each individual project, and people who are working on the same types of things tend not to group together in any coherent way. 
:To address your point more directly now, there certainly are alot of pages in need of help, and there are plenty of pages that qualify as &quot;link farms&quot;, and plenty of links that are simply spam. however, outside of the contributors to a particular book (who generally think their own contributions are good), there is no group of people who can be counted on to go through these pages and pick the gold from the garbage. 
:I can count on two hands the number of people who are actively working to help improve the project, and of those people, many have their own pet projects that take up alot of their time. We need more people, we need more admins, and we need a stronger sense of community here, all things that we don't have, and can't seem to find. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:09, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

== Old VfD ==

Looks to me as if quite a few of these could be closed now.  I'd happily do it but where a delete is the decision it would be an admin anyway.  I'll markup the &quot;survived&quot; ones tho if it helps.  The page can then be mostly archived to focus on the current ones?  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:23, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

== Hmm... red links in &quot;Completed Books&quot; ?? ==

[[Arimaa]], [[Basic Book Design]], [[Consciousness Studies]], [[Handbook of Genetic Counseling]], [[FHSST_Physics]] (maybe a few more) all have red links in their table of contents. I assume that &quot;completed books&quot; means completely completed, so I moved these books to &quot;Well Developed, Usable Books&quot; (from [[Wikibooks:Featured_books/Alphabetical_listing]] to [[Wikibooks:Featured_books#Well_developed,_usable_books]])
--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:42, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

:On wiki, a &quot;complete&quot; book is never actually complete in the sense of published books. A complete book really should be a resource that an instructor could use to teach a class without requireing supplemental material. To this end, a book can be complete in that sense, and still have plenty of room for addition. For instance, a book could be used to teach a single semester course, but it could easily be expanded to teach two or three semesters in that same subject. In other words, a book could be complete long before it is finished. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:00, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== Wiki vs. Book ==

I realize that these are supposed to be textbooks and hence the suggestions to limit links and so forth, but it occurs to me that there may be a way to handle it so that you don't lose what's great about the web (linking), but still maintain something that's consistent with print text. In fact, this was something a company I once worked for, did for creating the help files for their software and the software manuals, from the same source. That is, you have some sort of coding in the pages that says, &quot;this is web-specific&quot; and when the printable version is generated, the web-specific stuff is left out. And then you have stuff that's marked as &quot;this is print-specific&quot; and it's left out of the web page. I don't know if the latter is possible with wiki, but I would imagine that the former is, since I assume there's custom software for generating the print version of books... Anyway, just an idea. I'm working on the organic chemistry textbook and it would be nice to do stuff like the transcluded template at the [[w:Benzodiazepine|bottom of this page in wikipedia]] in various places in the organic textbook. It's not very useful in a printed version, but at least in the case of organic chem, where you have a lot of inter-related subjects and categories, this sort of structure can really help navigating the wiki version.

== Help with template ==

Hey all.
I'm trying to make a navigational template for use with the [[MATLAB Programming|MATLAB]] book, kind of like the one found on the [[Help:Template|help page]], problem is I can't get the text to wrap around it... does anyone know what I'm doing wrong? (I dont know anything about HTML so I'm not sure if there's a simple command for this. What I've done is what I could best discern was the same as what was in the help page, so I don't know what's different that's messing it up). The template is [[Template:MatlabNav|here]], it's not finished as of yet; any help you could give would be much appreciated!

== Editor differences ==

Just noticed that the WP default editor has a few extra buttons that are not on the WB editor.

:New buttons can be added to the editor via changes to the javascript and CSS files for the site. Administrators can make such changes, but on wikibooks we don't often make them to our own files, because I don't think there is as much desire here for the same things that people desire on wikipedia. If you can find something in particular that you absolutely want to have here on wikibooks, but that we don't currently have, let us know, and we will try to copy+paste in the necessary code. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:53, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

::Correct meif I'm wrong, but based on the editor that Herby told me about and that I'm now using, it appears that anyone can really customize the editorto their own tastes by simply adding the appropriate javascript totheir own skins. I guess for programmers like me, that's not as much of a trial as it would be for non-programmers, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are other tools out there like the Cacyle editor Herby turned me on to. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 17:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

::(edit conflict) I can think of a few, buttons for underline, subscript, superscript, big, small, strike through, line break, align left, align right, center, quote, code. Could probably use them even more then Wikipedia because book use styling a lot more then articles do. Should I perhaps turn it into a proposal for voting on? --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 17:41, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

== Speedy delete: [[C_Sharp_Programming/Index]] ==

I have placed a delete tag on the [[C_Sharp_Programming/Index]] page due to the fact that such a page makes little to no sense to include in any project that is using Wikimedia. The normal category page effectively fulfills the role that this page was designed for, if pages are properly categoriesed. Since I am currently properly categorising the book, I see no reason to keep the page. It appears that noone has contributed to the book in about a month either, so I don't think that i'm stepping on anyones toes here. --[[User:Ohms law|Ohms law]] 11:27, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

I removed the speedy tag from this page since it is definitely not something that can be immediately deleted without discussion, and that discussion is happening here right now anyway. I created this page for the reason of it being like a part of an actual book. Yes, categories do accomplish some of the things an index provides, but a lot of the cross-referencing that a good book needs cannot be achieved in categories. I've read many books that don't offer a deep index and it makes things much more difficult to locate, especially for a programming book. The page hasn't been developed, but that's just what happens with books here sometimes. It definitely should stay and will be a great benefit to the book once its content becomes larger. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:24, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
:Just an aside, Ohms law: this sort of thing ''usually'' gets discussed on [[WB:VFD]]... though in reality it probably just the same people there as here :). 
:A second aside: I agree with you totally that the categorization system is a very useful tool -- and I am firmly in the &quot;categorize everything&quot; camp --, but I sort of see wiki categories as being more useful to the authors than the readers, just as an index page is probably more useful to readers than authors... in fact I for one don't like writing indices, but I do try to update the index on my pet book from time to time. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:40, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

== Wikipedia Esperanza ==

[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Esperanza|Esperanza]], the community organization on wikipedia has been nominated for deletion. I'm not entirely sure if the motion will pass (based on sheer vote-counting, i assume it will not be deleted), but there is still a strong rift at wikipedia between the people who are trying to form a wiki-community, and the people who are trying to write a serious encyclopedia. The primary argument for deletion is that Esperanza serves primarily as a social networking club, and that it does not promote the contribution of material to the encyclopedia.

I've talked with [[User:SBJohnny]] about this, and we were thinking that perhaps we could extend an invite to the wikipedia esperanzans who have been disenfranchied on that project. This would serve the purpose of not only boosting wikibooks (more active contributors), but it would also be an importation of a pre-made community organization that would help make our project more cohesive.

I don't want to say anything without general community consent here, but I would like to invite members of Esperanza to join wikibooks, and bring some of their goodness with them. On wikipedia, Esperanza has served to greet new users, train admins, answer questions (in a setting less formal then staff lounge), and promote &quot;wikilove&quot;. I think wikibooks would benefit from all those things. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:37, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:Man, I think this serves the exact purpose we've been talking about in the &quot;On Advertising Wikibooks&quot; subject. Get more people here. I mean, this sounds to me like a golden opportunity to bring a good crowd of Wikipedians over who may very well find interest in helping out. I don't know the whole situation over on Wikipedia with regards to Esperanza, but on the face of it, it sure sounds like a fantastic idea.

:I've just read through some of the comments on the nomination for deletion. I still think it's a good idea. It sounds like the worst case is that Esperanza might need to focus their efforts a bit, but it doesn't sound like there's anything really wrong with it. Frankly, I don't see anything wrong with having a social community associated with this project or Wikipedia. Sure, it woild be great if everyone wanted to sit around all day and work on content contributions, but the fact is, if a social community helps bring people in and helps them learn the ropes, then it's only improving the project as a whole. BTW, sorry for not signing my last comment there. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 21:22, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:Although it's nice to have a sense of community, having a massive &quot;organization&quot; such as this seems distracting. In order to write a book you most certainly need a team of users in most cases, but I worry that Esperanza would bring more to the talk pages than the content pages. New or inexperienced users here can always use help, but I don't think that's a significant problem here; content production is what we need, not user interaction. A lot of the comments at the Wikipedia discussion center around time-wasting and I don't see how you could effectively invite those users over here. I would find it unusual to see a &quot;hey, even though you were dumped, we'll house you over here&quot; and I think it would become just a bunch of page moves of all their &quot;policies&quot; and not actual book-work here. There's even a committee or council of sorts that sounds almost like a crown, but I don't really know about how they operate exactly. If there was a community of content-writers that were being kicked out I would love for them to come here, but I don't think we're that desperate for more user interaction. Maybe they'll change their style once they get here, though. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:56, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

But the purpose of the project is to build community spirit, and our community spirit has been dampened by 2 major schisms over the past year: the forking-away of both wikiversity and strategywiki.

:::From reading through the comments from Esperanza members in the nomination for deletion, I got the sense there were a lot of members who were heavy content producers as well as members who weren't. I don't see having a bunch of non-content producers around as a problem, as long as they're not getting in the way of the content producers. If they're getting in the way, then that would be a problem. I have to say that, since I've gotten here, I've felt very welcomed by the people here and I enjoy the back and forth that goes on and it doesn't really distract me from doing content. I've got an exam tomorrow and I haven't had time to focus on writing content today, but I've had time to make a few posts here. Writing a book takes devoted concentration, so there are days when I'm not going to be able to provide that, but reading some posts and socializing a bit takes far less work. And some of it has been productive, even if it's not producing content. I think we've discussed some interesting points for improving Wikibook today, so I don't feel like that was time wasted at all. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:16, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

== Proposition of mathematics unification. ==

I would like to propose an initiative to unify most of the mathematics bookshelf.
It has come to my attention that the German wikibooks have used a technique of unifying all the mathematics books except for specific courses such as 'A level'.
If we were to cover all of mathematics from typical learning ages at 3 to 21 but keep specific syllabuses separate it would allow for much more progress to be made as well as an achievable target to be set.
Of course this decision will be pivotal to the future of wikibooks as a whole and I would like for some productive discussion to be made.

Yours sinceraly,
Edward Rein

An inspiring look at how the mathematics bookshelf should be can be seen at the following link using Google translator http://66. 249. 93. 104/translate_c?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;langpair=de%7Cen&amp;u=http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regal:Mathematik&amp;prev=/language_tools German Mathematics Wikibook shelf

:I don't think complete unification (assuming the definition that unification means to combine all mathematics topics into a single book) is a good idea. First off, there are some clear divisions in mathematics that would be well served by having their own separate books: Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, etc. Also, among these various branches, there are some clear deliniations in the subjects that people are taught in particular chunks. Consider [[Algebra]], for instance, which can be easily broken into [[Algebra]], [[Linear Algebra]], and [[Abstract Algebra]] topics easily, without having to cover duplicate material. If you consider that the goal of wikibooks is to generate textbooks, and textbooks typically accompany a year-long or a semester-long course of study, it makes  sense to either (a) divide up material into logical books that can be taught in a year/semester, or to (b) divide material from a single book into logical cubsections that can be taught in a year/semester. It makes no sense to combine all the books together and then have to break things down into separate chunks again. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:54, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

I would have to point out that some topics, particularly mathmatics but others as well, can be taught from very divergant viewpoints and methodologies.  Merging books together for the sake of simply presenting a single topic can be cumbersome at best and is not strictly needed in Wikibooks.  On the other hand, if there are several half-completed books about a given topic and combining sections can make something a bit more complete with some extra editing, that is something I support in general.  I wouldn't do this combining if there are active participants following very different philosophies from seperate Wikibook groups.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

:I think Rob makes a very good point here about the difficulty of combining actively edited wikibooks - I can see possibilities of ending up with something other than the &quot;best of both worlds&quot;!  Dormant/abadoned ones would be different --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 21:08, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

::I for one have examined the state of the mathematics bookshelf and it seems to me that from a readers perspective, it would be hard to attempt to learn from, particularly for younger readers. For instance one obviously wouldn't read linear algebra independently from a syllabus nor would one learn a topic such as surds in one book. So I conclude with contemplating this question, are the books made for students who will refer to this on specific syllabus or will they be fragmented for students to amend the inconsistent pieces? I personally think that the books should initially be targeted at the foundations and intermediate age of learning (4 – 18) which would require for books to be separated by ability not form of skill and with the fundamentals cemented, for higher levels to be accomplished. --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 21:35, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

: In response to Rob, I do agree that different topics can certainly be taught from strongly divergent viewpoints. As an example for which I am familiar with, the concepts of mathematics (especially some calculus topics) are taught very differently to engineering students then they are to mathematics students (or computer science students, or physics students, etc). For these cases, it might be worthwhile for each individual discipline to contain their own supportive texts on their own bookshelf. The primary [[Calculus]] text could be found on the mathematics bookshelf, but different bookshelves could also have their own adaptations of it. For instance, I've been working on a book called [[Engineering Analysis]] which is essentially a math book, but is being taught from an engineering point of view. The topics considered are only those with relevance to engineering, and the example problems are all engineering-related. 
:If we accept that solution, then the mathematics bookshelf could contain books taught from a purely-mathematical way, and books for divergent audiences could be moved to a more specific location. As a good example of this, in an undergraduate engineering or science curriculum, students typically take some &quot;math&quot; courses taught by the math department, but they also will take some mathematics-based courses that are taught by their own department (I took calculus in the math department, but took linear algebra and probability in the engineering department, for example). Doing things this way would allow us to clean up the mathematics bookshelf, and also strengthen the other bookshelves that use mathematics. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

::How would you propose we implement this, Whiteknight? --[[User:Herraotic|Herraotic]] 20:25, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Thats a good question, it's always easier to say that something can be done then to lay out specifically how it can be done. I think that what we need to lay out is a tree graphic that shows how different subjects inter-relate with one another. For instance, [[Arithmetic]] leads to [[Algebra]]. Algebra then can lead to [[Linear Algebra]], [[Geometry]], or [[Trigonometry]]. We could create a template that says &quot;This wikibook relies on material from (X), and provides material that leads to (Y)&quot;. 
:::Each book on the mathematics bookshelf should also have a statement that says &quot;This book will be written from a pure-mathematics point of view. For mathematics-related books to support science, technology, or engineering books, visit those specific bookshelves.&quot; Books on other shelves, such as science or engineering shelves would have to specify what are the prerequisites for reading the books, and whether those prerequisites can be satisfied from books on the math shelf, or whether those prerequisites can be satisfied with books on the science of engineering shelves. Here are some books that I think we should have, at least:
:::Arithmetic, Algebra, Linear Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Differential Equations (if not included in Calculus), Abstract Algebra, Probability, Complex Analysis.

== BOTM and COTM, december ==

I would like to propose that we (temporarily) abandon the COTM and BOTM initiatives. I think that we should abandon the current round of voting, and not declare any BOTM or COTM winners for December. The Wikijunior Book of the Quarter initiative can remain unchanged. My reasons for proposing this are as follows:
#None of the recent COTM or BOTM winners have attracted any special attention, nor received any noticable and prolonged boost in the number of contributors. In short, nobody is collaborating, and nobody is paying attention to these books.
#BOTM and COTM winners, recently, have won their respective titles with pitifully small numbers of votes. 3 or 4 votes does not a &quot;Book of the month&quot; make.
#The maintenance of the BOTM and COTM voting pages, lists, and monthly templates (especially those on the main page) has been lacking, and no person or group of people have really been stepping up to make this system great. This is not to say that nobody is doing it, but if it's just busy-work, and nobody really takes any pride in it, then why should we bother?
#The BOTM and COTM initiatives are more myopic, and less helpful then the [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] page, which lists many books, and also tells what specific kinds of improvements that each book needs.
I would like to not have a BOTM or a COTM for the month of december, and instead use that time to work on a number of wikibooks-related projects:
#A &quot;Staff Drive&quot;, to get more outside people interested in wikibooks, and get more of the active contributors here to participate more in project-wide maintenence. This would include, hopefully, a drive to nominate and install more admins.
#A general push to tie up loose ends on [[WB:PAG|Policy matters]], including old proposals and other unfinished business.
#Do more work in the help pages, and also the [[A Wikimedia Administrator's Handbook]]. Specifically, we should talk about how to produce print versions, PDF versions, etc of different books. Also, we could try and renew interest in the physical publication of wikibooks.
We had talked about abandoing BOTM and COTM previously, but it was never done. If we take a month off, and drum up more support, we can reinstall both initiatives starting in January, if we want. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:04, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''very much in favour'''.  This is a good place to be and has some very good editors.  It also has jobs that need doing - where I can help I will.  By comparison BOTM &amp; COTM don't look quite so important.  It would be great if a few people get behind this --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:29, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

*I read this earlier and Herby asked me to chime in. I'm very new here, so take my opinion however you want. Honestly, I have to agree with Whiteknight. I think there are other things going on here that are more important than the BOTM and COTM. If they're not helping to bring in contributors and they're using up time that could be better spent doing other things, then it makes perfect sense to do that.
:My time is pretty limited. I work full-time (40-60 hour weeks) and take about 12 hours of classes a week. My main motivation in working on the organic chemistry text is that to write an accurate textbook, I need to know the material inside and out, and therefore, it's a fantastic study aid for me.
:I mention all of this because, I'll be happy to help out if there's stuff I can do to lighten the load, but I want to qualify that by saying, I can make absolutely no time commitments. I'll do what I can, when I can, but work and school are my priorities and I won't let anything interfere with either. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 23:17, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

*I also agree with Whiteknight. I really don't think BOTM &amp; COTM are needed next month. There's allot of other things that need to be done around here. Image cleanup, maintenance tasks, book formatting, etc. And a Staff Drive would help, Wikibooks needs more users and admins.--[[User:Az1568|Az1568]] 01:44, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''Support''' - BOTM is a nice idea but hardly worthwhile given the small number of votes and especially if, as you say, it often results in the BOTM being abandoned as people now think it's perfect.  Wikibooks has a lot of users but it's difficult for newbies to find out how to nominate books (all this trawling through different pages to find out what's going on) and as such, I imagine, most books are nominated by a small group of regular users. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 11:21, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''Support''' - Additionally I think that if something like BOTM and COTM should be restarted that they should first be collapsed into one initiative, such as &quot;Featured Book of the Month&quot; to complement [[Wikibooks:Featured books]]. Perhaps even requiring potential book canidates to have been listed on that page for awhile. Another disadvantage to the ones Whiteknight mentioned that I see is with two different initiatives, any efforts to bring intention and contribitions to a book is split in half, lowering the intended effectiveness of the initiatives. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 13:29, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

*'''Wonder'''. I've been trying to get the [[shaving]] book COTM status since June. I remember the book getting a lot more edits when it was new. I believe those edits came in because the book was mentioned on the front page, in the new books list. I have no reasons to believe that &quot;merchandising&quot; wouldn't help the book to get more edits again. Many COTM winners have been about complex subjects. Not everyone can write about technical subjects, while a book about a simple task such as shaving can be extended by almost anyone. For that reason I believe that the book can benefit from COTM status more than many recent winners. --[[User:Easyas12c|Easyas12c]] 23:17, 14 November 2006 (UTC)
*:But by that rationale, it would almost make more sense for us to list all the &quot;good&quot; books in one box on the main page (which is already the case), and all &quot;Close to Good&quot; books in another box on the main page. This way, books like [[Shaving]] which would probably excel from a little publicity doesnt need to wait for a particular month to be advertised, it can have a semi-permanent place on the main page. One thing that i've noticed recently is that many of the books that are voted COTM or BOTM (and I agree that most of them recently ahve been overly technical) simply haven't attracted any additional attention. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:14, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' -- I've never taken part in these discussions, so don't have any opinion on it. However, if the goal is to get new contributors, maybe it's time we set up an RFC process... for us, the &quot;C&quot; could stand either for Comment ''or'' Contributions ([[w:WP:RFC]] is used primarily for dispute resolution, but we could use it for more than just that). I've also been using a template on wikipedia to attract contributors to new transwikis: add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:howtobook}} ~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the bottom of the talk page (see [[w:Template:Howtobook]] for text). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:44, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
*'''Support in part''' COTM has only one book (currently) with more than one votes ([[Shaving]] with four) however, BOTM has two both with four, which leads to a tie but tiw breaking rules are already in place and have already been used, one of these will likley go on to January.  As for Wikijunior Bugs has 6 votes, Human Body 3, and World Religons and WWII both have four so there will likely be a clear winner and plenty of books automatically transfered to January.  As I see it Wikijunior and BOTM should move on while COTM can also move on (since it has a clear winnner) but maybe it should temporarily stop COTM voting.  For maintanance perhaps we should start a Wikiproject similar to those in Wikipedia so that they do get maintained.[[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 17:39, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

== 7 day waiting period before VFD ==

If something is obviously not a vandalism or a newbie test, I think we should wait some 7 days before putting a delete or vfd tag on it. I don't think it should be policy, but at least a guideline. Just something to keep in mind to respect the authors. If something is that young anyway, a quick talk with the author about how he can revise it should suffice as opposed to the rather strong action of &quot;delete&quot;. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:20, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

: Basically, I'd rather have someone talk with the author if the book is younger than 7 days, than for anyone to put a delete tag on it. This isn't wikipedia, and by default, this project will move slower than wikipedia.

::::Darklama's code actually tracks the page by the last time it was edited, not the time that the tag was put on the page, meaning that a new contributor could continue to work on the page and keep moving the date forward. Hopefully people using the tag will be sure to watchlist the page as well, so it can be removed as progress is made, in the case that the author is unfamiliar with the use of talk pages, which I suspect may happen more often than we think it does. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:46, 14 November 2006 (UTC)

This just seems to add to the confusion.  I've nominated some books for deletion because, generally, they're full of crap.  They may be new and not obviously a speedy candidate (as they don't have vandalism, spam or commercial stuff) but even so I think it's possible to say it should be deleted even if it's less than 7 days old.

== Some odd  pages ==

Given discussion on VfD/speedy above I'll not speedy some of these.  However there are a collection of new pages that are not straightforward.  [[October/November 2003]] merely has links in to [[Paper 4]] and [[Paper 2]] and in turn these only have links to &quot;upload pages&quot;.  If this was not an issue what you do get as an upload looks very like a copvio in both cases.  While there is no copyright notice exam papers in the uk may be copyrighted and I do not know the procedure for licensing on such a pdf file.  Look around beyond this ones listed as [[May/June 2004]] for example also exists.  Possible all incorrectly named and ''may'' be related to [[IG Mathematics]] which also links to pdfs --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:27, 15 November 2006 (UTC)
By the way - I do realise that if these pages are valid they are not named correctly! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:27, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:Actually these are probably speediable... aside from bad naming convention, they're apparently not directed at any sort of audience at all (if they were, they'd presumably be titled/categorized/bookshelved to alert an audience of their presence).

== On Advertising Wikibooks ==

Herby and I had a short back and forth on my talk page and he suggested I post my comments here, so blame him &lt;g&gt;. Keep in mind, I'm still quite new here, so take my comments however you want. I came to wikibooks entirely by accident. Apparently Herby did too. I'm not completely out of the loop on what's out on the web. I'm a regular Slashdot reader, I'm an almost daily Wikipedia reader, but I have never heard of Wikibooks, at least that I recall.

There was mention earlier about skipping the BOTM/COTM to concentrate on other things that need doing and I have a couple of ideas about how the Wikibooks project might be served best. 1&gt; It needs to be advertised better out there. For people who contribute to programming books here and also do support on usenet newsgroups for programming, or on web site forums, reference wikibooks. For people working on books on other topics, when they're on other sites related and someone asks a question that might be answered in a wikibook, point them to the wikibook.

But here's another issue I think is crucial and this is based on the old expression, &quot;You never get a second chance to make a first impression.&quot; When someone goes to Wikipedia, 98+% of the time, they see a pretty complete article. There are a lot of books here in the early stages or abandoned. Books that simply aren't very active. I'm certainly not advocating getting rid of this material, but I think there ought to be some way to make the more complete books more visible than the less complete books. That doesn't mean to make the less complete books really difficult to find, just make them less prominent. I don't know how best to do this and maybe others here will have better ideas on this. But if someone comes here and the first book they look at has mostly empty pages, their first impression is going to be, &quot;Wow, this place needs work,&quot; and they may very well leave. On the other hand, if the first thing they see is a pretty complete book, they may stick around longer and decide to get involved in some of the less complete books.

It's just my theory and again, I'm new here, so take all this with a grain of salt. I want to help out where I can and at the moment, that's going to be mostly in the organic chem text because I feel it needs a lot of work and I feel I can contribute a lot to it. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:00, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with this assesment, and to a degree it's this way of thinking that has influenced the current design of our main page. For instance, the large box at the top with the &quot;Featured Books&quot;, or the links on the sidebar to &quot;Completed Books&quot; were all added for just these reasons. also, the BOTM initiative was designed to spotlight a particular book that is particularly good, and to prominently display that book on our main page. The COTM initiative was designed to put a similar spotlight on a collaborative project that is currently undergoing alot of work. I think that we need to have more of a focus on our completed books, and put our less-completed books (or books that need work but who are actively attracting contributors) in some place that is less visible (such as the community portal), but put a link on the main page for &quot;books needing authors&quot;, or even &quot;Adopt a book!&quot;. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:07, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

::Ibelieve the Organic Chem book was a BOTM back in June, and in yourmessage you said, &quot;BOTM  initiative was designed to spotlight aparticular book that is particularly good&quot;. Now, I'm not  saying it's abad book, but as someone studying Organic Chemistry, this book is stillfar below the  standards of Organic Chemistry textbooks in terms ofcompleteness. There are many fundamental  aspects that are glossed overat the moment that need a great deal more elaboration. There's definitely some reorganization stuff that needs to happen, and soforth. I'm not trying to put the  book down at all. Clearly, a greatdeal of work has gone into it, but I wouldn't consider it a good candidate for a complete book and it probably shouldn't have beenhighlighted as a BOTM. If you  don't know organic chemistry and you justlook over the book, it might appear pretty complete and  the problemthere is, you need to rely on the honest assessment of peoplecontributing to a book  like this, or people who are familiar with thetopic, to know if a book is ready to be brought out  into the spotlight.One thing that might be helpful is, at least on the title page orcontents page  for books, is to have a prominent notice of the state ofthe book overall. I know we try to mark  the  progress of individualsections and the Organic Chem book could use this a little more, but I think something that rated the book on several factors, that'sprominently displayed, would also  make visitors more understandingabout incomplete works. For example, if the table of contents had something like: This book has the following ratings (Coverage oftopics= 75%, Depth of coverage =  50%, Average completeness of sections= 75%, Editing Activity 4 out of 10) or something like that.  Thosemight not be the things to rate, but it gives some idea of the state ofthe book. It lets  people know if there's a lot of recent editingactivity or not recent editing activity. Once a book  is more or lesscomplete, then you simply replace it with: This book is a mature work,or something  like that. At that point, editing activity doesn't matterand the other stuff is considered pretty  much 100% complete. But Ithink that gives the new visitor a good idea of the state of a given book.  Now who makes those ratings and how? I don't know. It's hard toget an objective, honest  assessment sometimes. One person's idea ofcomplete is probably different from someone else's.  Anyway, justtossing out ideas... -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 17:27, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

::::That's another point that I agree with you on. I don't like the 25%, 50%, etc symbols, because the 100% symbol implies that the book is ''finished'', when in reality a wikibook is never finished. Seeing a 00% or a 25% on a book indicates that it's below-average and probably not worth any time. There are other symbols that have been used on the [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] page that are significantly better for use:
::::*(c): the book is still lacking in content.
::::*(o): the book is lacking in organization and structure.
::::*(s): the book suffers from a lack of style (or poorly applied style) and formatting
::::*(w): the book needs less html and more wikiformatting
::::*(n): the book uses a poor naming convention
::::*(t): the book has many stub pages or red links.
::::These symbols are significantly better signs of the state of a book, and they could probably be expanded to be even more specific.  --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:35, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::Hmm perhaps stages could be reworked to not represent how far until completation a book or chapter is, but its level of development, and instead of using percent signs use a sliding scale between 0 and 4?
:::::* 0 : new book or lacking contents
:::::* 1 : consists mainly of stub pages or red links
:::::* 2 : needs organization and structure
:::::* 3 : book needs additional contents and editors
:::::* 4 : book is developed enough to read and learn from.

But even then, people will see books that are (4), and will say &quot;I dont need to contribute to that book, because it's complete&quot;. People will see books that are (1) or (0), and say &quot;that book is probably garbage, i'm not going to waste my time with it. We really need to stress the point that ''all books need help'', and we can point out the specific types of help that the book needs. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:19, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:Maybe just get rid of the stages thing compleatly then and have something like [[Wikibooks:Books needing help]] page where book editors can say exactly what type of help they need? It could be like this page or like the community portal and other pages for books that need help and people willing to help out. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:41, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

::That's definately an Idea in the right direction, but i'm still of the opinion that ''all books need help'', and many of the books that need the most help don't currently have an active contributing author associated with them. We could set up voting system where books could be added to [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] based on a vote. This would be like BOTM, but it could happen at any time (hopefully many books each month). On that page, books are broken into &quot;Good Books&quot; (books which are mostly usable as-is, but with a few suggestions), and &quot;Working books&quot; (books that are on their way up, but need work). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:52, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:::&quot;''people will see books that are (4), and will say &quot;I dont need to contribute to that book, because it's complete&quot;.''&quot;
:::Whiteknight, I wouldn't worry so much about that situation, and here's why. The point is to get people here, get them reading the books and using the site. Once they've been around for a little while, they'll start to understand how things work. If they have any interest in contributing, they'll start looking around to see what's involved, just like I did. The plain fact is, a vast majority won't want to contribute, and that's fine. The trick is just getting people to spend enough time here so that the ones who do want to contribute will stick around long enough to get interested. At least, that's how I see it. How exactly the ratings are done doesn't need to be decided right this moment. I think the fact that we all pretty much agree that this is a good direction to go is an indicator that something should be done about it. And other people may want to weigh in on this as well. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 20:58, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Well I'm sure you might agree some books need more help then others even though all books need some form of help. People could mentioned abandoned books on [[Wikibooks:Books needing help]] as well, not just the editors of the book. I think though most likely people who would be mentioning an abandoned book are those people who may be interested in reviving it, but need help doing so. &quot;Working books&quot; may also give the impress to people that those books don't need help. The only solution I can think of to prevent giving the impression that some books are compleated and some books aren't is to avoid the concepts entirely. However I'm not how books could get helped then. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 21:08, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

::: &quot;All books need help&quot;, well, I would have to agree, for now. However; I hope that there is a point where they won't need help any more. Where they can sit stable, and everyone can wipe their hands off with a project well done. We really need to make a publication process of some sort. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 05:12, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

=== Another route. Grassroots style ===

While the talk above is definitly important for the overall feel of wikibooks, I feel that there are other directions we can face as well. Whenever we start a new colaboration of the month, I think we should really focus on the book. As much or even more as we do on Wikijunior colaborations. Maybe collaboration of the quarter or something, something that can take a book and actually run it through like the Big Cats book was run through. Get every page worked up to perfection, have lots of people read through the entire book, and after a few months, even typeset a ''nice'' PDF version.

In such a colaboration, we should also look for the other communities. We should ask for help from say, the Python community to create a nice beginner Python book. Send emails to developers and interested experts who can review the material. From there on out, we stabilize the book somehow, and create a print version.

While we are doing this, we are working with the Python community. They will create the documentation they need by using wikibooks, and in the end, we all benifit. Thats what this project is here for right? We really need a real bookshelf around here, something totally complete that we can brag about. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:52, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

::For myself, in the organic chem text, I generally link new words to the glossary the first time they appear in a section, but not afterwards.

::Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think linking is okay, as long as two things are kept in mind: 1) You're writing a self-contained book.

::::I agree, excessive linking like wikipedia isn't necessary, and usually, if I do make a link, I make it only the first time the word is used, so there may be a few in the beginning of a section, but very few, if any, later on.

:OK well...I will work on using a glossary then. One thing though. I was planning to write a wikibook &quot;Write Arabic&quot;, short for &quot;Learn to read and write the Arabic script&quot;. It would concentrate on writing and only have very brief instructions re: pronunciation. The Arabic script is used for dozens of languages, I believe. Specifically, it is used for [[user:pfctdayelise/Uyghur|Uyghur]] (A Turkic language) as well as standard Arabic, of course. So instead of having separate modules on writing for each of these languages, doesn't it make sense to just have one book on writing, and all broader books like &quot;Learn Uyghur&quot; and &quot;Learn standard Arabic&quot; can refer to this writing book. A similar thing could be done for basic Hanzi/Kanji strokes and some principles of stroke order stuff. Also Cyrillic alphabet (although I suspect if you know the Latin/Roman alphabet, which presumably you do in en.wb, Cyrllic would not be that hard). Anyway... see what I'm getting at? Isn't it fine to have a book that is a &quot;prerequisite&quot; for other books? (Seems like there would be a lot in maths.) [[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 12:33, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

:::OK. Because the whole reason I thought of it was that I want to write &quot;Learn Uyghur&quot;, but if you assume the reader is starting from scratch, you really need to spend a bunch of time on writing Arabic, even though it's not ''that'' related to Uyghur. So if I was printing &quot;Learn Uyghur&quot;, I would bundle the books together, and I was thinking that Arabic etc could do that too. [[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 16:40, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

Just one more thought on printing books or not. I was planning to include a lot of links to sound files for pronunciation comparison. I think the conception that a Wiki&quot;book&quot; ultimately can only be printed is a bit narrow. I envisage something closer to interactive multimedia software/CD (commons for learning languages these days). Shouldn't Wikibooks have some model for this too? [[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 16:44, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

:'''Wikibooks is not paper''', although the stated goal of several books is to eventually be printed and distributed as such. Many physical textbooks in this world come with supplimental materials such as CDs, or even links to supplemental websites. The fact is that print is a much more restrictive medium then wiki, and if you are going to use all the possibilities that wiki has to offer (audio and video, for instance), you won't be able to translate them into print. Many books can be physically printed, however, and I dont think we should discourage that. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:32, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

::I'm with Whiteknight on this. Many textbooks today do come with CDs, DVDs, and even web sites where users can get additional multimedia-based stuff. Also, I think it's unrealistic to assume that most readers WON'T have access to the internet. Almost everyone in industrial countries will have access to the internet, so if there's multimedia, simply provide a URL int he print version for how to get to it.
::As for the arabic alphabet, though, it's not that difficult to learn to write it, I don't think. I mean, like anything else, it's mostly practice. Obviously, the lack of vowels makes reading a difficulty for people used to them, but diacritical marks to indicate vowels is common in books on learning arabic and they too are easy to learn. But for reading in Arabic, and I'm assuming Uyghur is the same, though I don't know the first thing about it, but to read without diacritical marks, you really need to know the words you're reading... Anyway, I just can't imagine that there's enough involved in the arabic alphabet to require more than a pamphlet. Maybe I'm missing something. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 18:01, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Well, it would be a fairly ''short'' book. Is there a size requirement?? I just thought it makes sense to compartmentalise it rather than unnecessarily duplicate the same material between books. I think the hard bit is learning the connected forms. (BTW: Uyghur uses a fully vowelled Arabic script. Thank goodness. ;)) --[[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 05:39, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

::::I do think it's a good idea to compartmentalize material, ''especially material that is shared between multiple books''. For an example, I've created the &quot;book&quot; [[Engineering Tables]], which is essentially a compendium of materials that are shared among multiple books on the Engineering bookshelf. When you make your print versions, just make sure that you properly transclude these external resources. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:22, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::From that point of view, it does make sense. Farsi also uses, more or less, the same alphabet, as well. I think they have a P where arabic has a B, but otherwise, I think they're the same (same character as B but with a triangle of 3 dots under it instead of 1). I found the lack of vowels very frustrating. But really, I found many things about arabic frustrating. It's a difficult language. That was a long time ago, though. I might have better luck these days since I have a few other languages under my belt... -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 02:05, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

== Some help, this world changes fast and frequently ==

I noticed a comment on formatting a few weeks ago, I cannot find it now.  This place is almost a dream world, slip in, slip out, it is never the same.

I have noticed my book, Telescope Making, changes it's format with different browsers on different machines at different resolutions.  I make it look good on one, it is a disaster on another.  Anyone have any ideas?

I am doing a PDF version also and could post that.  Maybe leave the illustrations out of the online and only put them in the PDF?

--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 19:52, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

:Yeah, it can be tricky, and unfortunately with the combination of Wiki/HMTL/CSS that we can use here, it is difficult to specify precisely how a page should look. the result is that things tend to &quot;float&quot; around the page, popping up where ever the browser thinks they will fit best (which frequently isn't where the author intended it to go). I wouldn't leave the illustrations out, but having a really nice PDF version will let everybody know how you intended the page to look. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:21, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

Where then would one place that PDF version?  I am writing the text locally, then pasting it to an edit screen as a section gets done, so the PDF is one step ahead of the online.  I have a suggestion from an old timer I know locally to put the image and associated text together as an image and let it float.  I will try that.
--[[User:Vorblesnak|Vorblesnak]] 00:00, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

BTW:  I am doing the writing but there is a group of us doing the composing.  I had not noticed any way to add an author to the title.  Or would that go in the top of the first page as a header?  I will look around and see what others have done, but it is a question I have been meaning to research.

== Holiday Cleaning! ==

I forgot who brought up the idea of not having a BotM or CotM for December, but here is an idea that will follow up with that idea. I thought we could have a &quot;quasi&quot; collaboration by using the links over at [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks_maintenance]].

Big tasks:

* [[User:Prod/Image_list]] I've been whacking at this a little bit. Basically, my Wikibook was transwikied to Strategy wiki, and Prod set up a list of all the images related to my wikibook. There is a lot, and a lot of deletions have to be done. Just take a couple of them a day or something. I personally don't have the will to go through all those deletions in one run :-/

* [[Special:Lonelypages]] lists 581 (as of now) pages that are orphaned. They are virtually inaccessable. We should integrate them back into their books, turn them into stubs, or delete them. (or whatever appropriate thing that I forgot to list).

* [[Special:Shortpages]] I'm not sure how this page works, but it appears that every few days, it takes the 1000 shortest pages in all of wikibooks and puts them on that page. Usually, a short page is a work of vandalism or an unworkable stub. We should go through that a couple of times.

* [[Special:Unusedimages]] 1500+ Unused images. We should come up with something that will clean that up. Maybe not delete them outright, but an unused image is a red-flag IMO.

* &lt;s&gt;And maybe even... use [[Special:Allpages]] and systematically get rid of all junk, list abandoned projects, and so forth. But... thats stretching it :-p But the longer we wait, the harder it would get!&lt;/s&gt; Bah, crazy idea. NM :-p --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:39, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

:*'''In favour''' - the principle has my vote and I will do what I can.  However can I throw in [[Wikibooks:Cleanup]].  I came across two pages in the past couple of days that have been listed since the 29th November 2005 with nothing much having happened to them. Old chestnut too but the help pages generally tend to be anything but &lt;g&gt; --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:23, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
:PS - the category as well as the page itself! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:24, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

::*'''In Favor''' - Here's my first recommendation: There are about 300+ images from user [[User:DarkNShadow]] that are unused. They were uploaded in February and this user has contributed to no books. There are a bunch of images from users [[User:Filare]] (~25 images), [[User:Antme]] (~30 images), [[User:Llvoklojl]] (~30 images) uploaded in Sept, 2004. These users have contributed to no books. From August 2005, we have about 70 images from user [[User:Leptictidium]] who has contributed to no books.
::There are a bunch from user [[User:Gmcfoley]] that appear to be for some Sonic Hedgehog game guide. He's been active around here lately, so maybe someone ought to ask him about those.
::Anyway these might be a good place to quickly cut those numbers down in the Unused images. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 15:11, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
::: All of those images for Maple Story, uploaded by [[User:DarkNShadow]] are listed on [[User:Prod/Image_list]]. Just delete everything on Prod's list, and it should be good. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:31, 18 November 2006 (UTC)
::: Oh, and for the Sonic thing... as long as that Sonic guide remains here, I see no reason to delete the images. If it gets a VfD or a deletion... then maybe we should worry about it. But it is time to start making Wikibooks a better place to get information --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:57, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

Tell ya what: let's get ogranised at [[Wikibooks:Cleanup]]! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:20, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

: I don't see much sense in making print version for a book that has no text. Anyway, I created it using [[User:Derbeth/Print Version Creator|my script]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:36, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

== Using JMol ==

There's an application called JMol that's used for interactively viewing molecules. I mentioned it in one of the pages and Ewen asked me if we could use it here on Wikibooks. It would be particularly useful in the chemistry books and even the biochem books, since JMol can also visualize complex moelcules like proteins.

JMol is a java application and it's activated from a JavaScript on the page. That stuff, I believe, is easy enough to manage. The big problem is that JMol may need certain file permissions that might have to be done at the web server level. I'm not entirely sure how that works. I've installed it locally on my computer, but never on a server, so I'd have to do a little more research to get the details.

The obvious problem with using it in a wikibook is you can't run Java on paper. My thoughts there were to keep all the JMol stuff on separate pages that aren't in the printed version of the book with links that from the text that's in &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; sections. Obviously the text and diagrams on the main page would need to be sufficient in themselves with the JMol stuff simply being a multimedia extra... Anyway, I'd appreciate any thoughts on thsi before I go digging around for the specifics on what would be required to install JMol on the servers. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 18:50, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
:The Wikimedia servers are incredibly complex and use a shared-code system across the projects. I don't believe they would ever consider installing anything server-side since additions could affect all sites. That sort of thing just can't be requested and the developers would most likely consider it too small a service for all of Wikimedia. The best you could do is get screenshots and upload them as images. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:08, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
::Thanks for the info. I suspected that would probably be a problem, but I figured there was no harm in throwing it out there. We have plenty of diagrams of rendered models in the book. The whole point of JMol is that you can use the mouse to rotate them around which gives you a much better 3-D perspective of the molecules. Frequently, in organic chemistry, students are encouraged to buy molecule model kits so that they can build molecules and actually spin them around and look at them, because understanding the 3-dimensional aspect of the molecules is just crucial in organic chemistry (as well as biochemistry). That's why we wanted to add it.
::And really, it just depends on the person. Personally, I find it very easy to visualize a moderately complex molecule in my head, spin it around and what have you, but this is something that a lot of people don't come by naturally, and these sorts of interactive tools are a great help. Anyway, there's a link to a list of web sites that use it in the text, so people can just use those. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 19:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
:::Just thought I'd mention, JMol actually has a MediaWiki specific extension that's being used on some wikis out there. I doubt that'll make any difference, but just thought I'd mention it. Like I said, it's something that would be useful for several of the sciences. But I certainly understand the difficulties involved in managing a complex of servers and adding software like that is certainly not something to be taken lightly. Anyway, I'm fine without it. It'd just be a nice perk. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 02:09, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

== Notification of nominations for Bureaucrats == 
This is to notify the community that I have made two nominations for bureaucrats.

==Request for Comment on Wikijunior Style Guide== 
I'd like to invite anyone who has an interest or opinion to comment on the proposed Wikijunior [[Wikijunior:Style_Guide|Style Guide]] on the [[Talk:Wikijunior:Style_Guide|talk page]]. I think that the proposal could be improved in a lot of ways. I do think it's necessary to have some Style guide in place, because many users have noticed problems with various Wikijunior books that are addressed by this guide. In particular, guidelines for accuracy, voice, and age appropriateness are discussed. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 14:40, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== [[WB:LMOS]] ==

Regarding the Wikijunior MoS question and questions that have been fielded about transwikis (mostly on wikipedia talk pages after something is imported), I'm wondering if there's any objection to starting to deploy these redirects? 

This would be useful for the second &quot;transwiki cleanup template&quot;: {{tl|bookify}}. What I want to do is have a page listing &quot;Wikibooks with Local Manuals of Style&quot;, and add redirects in the form of &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Bookname/LMOS]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. This redirect would point to the &quot;policy&quot; pages of books that have policy pages, or otherwise to local variants of the staff lounge, etc. 

I added one this morning: [[Wikijunior/LMOS]], though in that case [[Wikijunior:LMOS]] would make sense as well, since it's a pseudonamespace covering a lot of different books. 

We seem finally to have piqued the interest of a few groups of wikipedians, so aside from [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]], having pointers to local Ms of S should help them integrate more easily. Also, having a number of books with LMOS pages will help give authors of new books something to consider when defining the structure of a wikibook. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:27, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

==Missing PDF link in infobox==
I have made a pdf version of the wikibook on [[Nanotechnology]] and put it in the commons  [[:image:Nanotechnology.pdf]]. Then the infobox for the book should have a small pdf icon added, linking to the pdf but that didnt happen. I have tried adding the link manually, still no pdf-icon... maybe I misunderstood something - does anyone have a way to trick the icon into presence?

== Unlicenced images now being flagged ==

[[User:HDBot|HDBot]] is now running... all uncategorised images are now being flagged with {{tl|nld}}. We have a fully automated deletion bot available to us, and I think it would be good to let it do its thing within the next week or two. If there's no objection, I will alter the sitenotice to say '''''Warning:'' Unlicenced images will soon be deleted, using a bot. Please check to be sure you have not uploaded any images without a licence, as they will be deleted without further consideration by a human administrator.'''

Once the deed is done, I hope we can keep on top of unlicenced images, because running deletion bots is a rather scary thing! --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:31, 22 November 2006 (UTC)

== What is the inclusion criteria now? ==

I have not contributed to Wikibooks [[Special:Contributions/Iamunknown|for a long while]] now (except for one contribution in October). But I have poked around a few times and seen some discussion going on. Probably as a result of my mere gloss, I am confused as to what is now accepted at this project. I know that game-guides are not, but what are the consequences of the recent Wikiversity split? Are math and science textbooks not allowed? Anyways, I am considering becoming a bit more active in this project, but I'm confused. Please elaborate. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 00:34, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

: I'm still not sure about the game-guides thing, as it isn't mentioned in [[WB:WIW]] actually. But I haven't contributed in a while either. Math and Science will always be allowed here. Wikiversity split actually a few years ago, but stayed because they were petitioning for their own server. So basically, Wikiversity was only a part of Wikibooks for a short time. Their goals involve making tutorials, example questions and learning. Our focus is more on textbooks, manuals, and so forth. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 00:58, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, science is definitely still here. I just started working on the organic chemistry textbook a few weeks ago and there are definitely other science books being worked on here.

I was going to start a new section on this, but since it seems somewhat related I decided against it. I notice there are at least three alteranative suggestions for replacing [[WB:WIW]]. [[Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable]], [[Wikibooks:Inclusion_criteria/Proposal]] and [[Wikibooks:Textbooks]]. Two of which have tags on them suggesting they should be merged, but no indication that any discussion took place for or against doing so. I'm wondering is there are any objections to going ahead and merging all 3 of them? This would cut down on duplicate work and make it easier to work on a common proposal for updating or superceding [[WB:WIW]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:38, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::All the unofficial &quot;temporary&quot; branches of that policy can really be altered however you see fit, it's all just bookkeeping if you ask me. The inclusion criteria hasn't changed much lately, nothing certainly that you need to worry about. Nothing has been decided specifically about the videogame guides, but many of those guides have been moving themselves to StrategyWiki of their own accord.

== Wikibooks Publication ==

Currently, I see several books that are ready for true publication, and many more books that would benifit from a nicely formatted PDF file. However; we do not have process to do any kind of publication process. On a [[w:Capability_Maturity_Model]], we are initial. Ad hoc, no real process, and dependant on the skills of individuals.

I think it is time to start thinking seriously about Wikibooks Publication. We have enough books to keep the process full. We need to ask questions like &quot;Why isn't the [[Ada]] PDF file on Lula Press?&quot; (and if you look at it, it is quite obvious. Even if the Ada book is complete, you can see that the layout of the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/8/8d/Ada_Programming.pdf PDF] is terrible. There is no index, pictures aren't placed well, so on and so forth. It is arguably better to print the &quot;print version&quot; from FireFox than to use that PDF file.

So even if we aren't going for a Lulu publication, we should at least clean up the PDFs lying around this site. LaTeX or Docbook or texinfo it into a simple book. Maybe several books for the purpose of the viewer (I know texinfo supports conditional &quot;compiling&quot;, so it would be simpler to have multiple print versions from a single file. I'd expect DocBook and LaTeX to have some kind of similar feature)

But here are some things that we can do regardless of the specific book we are working on.

* Standard book cover. Check out the O'Reilly series of books for example, or penguin books. Something simple with our logo and enough room for a title is all we need.

* Standard one page &quot;What is Wikibooks&quot; or &quot;About us&quot; that goes in front of every book.

* Stylebook. (A, B, and C. Or should we do... A, B and C. ??) Something standard for every book we publish, and layout. This is a lower priority goal, but it does make a difference. The standard layouts from the O'Reilly series or Wrox series makes the entire set of books an easy read. We know what to expect in terms of layout before we open the book, enhancing readability and giving Wikibooks a &quot;style&quot; and touch of professionalism. Somethings in the Stylebook can include...
** Summaries on Back Cover as well as front cover?
** How many indecies? Only one index in the very back? Or maybe two or more? One for concepts/phrases and one for keywords? If only one index, then what should the style of it be? Keywords, or concepts?
** Glossary last, or Index last?
** How many tables of contents? Short version (no sections listed, only chapters), Long version (parts, chapters, sections and subsections listed), Table of figures, table of images?
** Style of &quot;new chapter&quot; pages. Quote on every new chapter, or is a simple joke fine? What about the end of chapters?
** Headers and footers on every page. Should the page number be in a box? Should there be a rule. So on, so forth.

DocBook, LaTeX and texinfo do have things where you can tweek the appearance and make this consistent. (O'Reilly uses their own DocBook format for example in their publishing process).

I know this is a lot all at once, but we really need to start thinking about the massive process of turning wikitext into some kind of book. Also, a process for Wikijunior would be nice as well, but Gabriel Hurley and his job on Big Cats probably has set some kind of standard of what to expect over there. Wikibooks textbooks don't have to be as creative with layouts (Adults don't need attention-grabbing layouts to keep reading. But that helps little kids so Wikijunior needs it) --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 03:19, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

Oh, and of course, the Stylebook doesn't _have_ to be '''that''' strict. But I think that if we are going to be using the Trademark name of Wikibooks, we better turn it into a trademark of high quality. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]
:I have a few comments here that may or may not be helpful. First, like i mentioned below, I think that we could probably benefit from some kind of &quot;Votes for Good Books&quot; page, or something similar, where books could be nominated, and voted on to receive the title &quot;Good book&quot;. This would be similar to the current BOTM and COTM processes, except any number of books could be selected per month. Also, I dont think it's a good idea to try and micromanage the way people create PDF files. Granted, some of the PDF files might not look good, but what we don't want is to have a million PDF files that all look exactly the same. Many books have their own specific ways of formatting/layout, and I dont think we should try and make global changes. However, there are some things that all PDF files should have:
:#Title Page
:#Link to the current working version of the book on Wikibooks (possibly with the Wikibooks/wikimedia logos, if necessary)
:#Table of Contents (preferrably with page numbers, but not required)
:#Full text of the GFDL
:#Full text of any other licenses, besides the GFDL, that are used with the images from the book (or perhaps just links to the full text?)
:#Listing of authors of the book, complient with the GFDL (at least 5 major contributors, or all contributors if less then 5).
:I dont know much about DocBook or LaTeX, or anything like that, but I do have Adobe Acrobat Professional, and I would be willing to use that to help improve some of the PDF versions that do exist on here. For an example of my work, you can see [[:Image:Control Systems.pdf]]. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:54, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:: DocBook and LaTeX are similar to programming. Quite literally. I know that in LaTeX, you can make &quot;macros&quot; (basically templates in LaTeX) and it has conditional compiling, registers (to keep track of pages) and stuff like that. You write a source file, then you &quot;compile&quot; it, and nearly everything after that is automatically generated. The Index is automatically generated, the table of contents is automatically generated, stuff like that. Then it spits out a PDF file. I'm not too fond of Latex's standard output, nor of Docbooks, but thats why those guys have style sheets. Texinfo is based on TeX (precursor to LaTeX) and has a nice standard layout, but I'm not sure if we can change it. (all the [http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/ documentation] of texinfo is in texinfo. DocBook has similar capabilities, but I'm not fond of the XML system they got. Kinda bulky... need an XML editor to enjoy it really).

:: And yeah, I do realize that it is kind of imposing to make a wikibooks wide stylebook, but when I see the O'Reilly series, it makes it feel like it would really be worth it. I don't think authors would really care whether the &quot;note&quot; is on the left side on the margins, or in the text in a gray box for example. But when a whole publication does it consistently one way, not just with a single book but throughout a series, there is this unity and real professionalism that emerges. Take a look at O'Reilly books or Wrox yourself. Or &quot;XXXX for dummies&quot; and cliff notes for example. All their layouts are unique and standard to the company, and that is something I think Wikibooks should aim for. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 17:19, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:::I own many of the O'Reilly books, but I dont think that we should necessarily try to do what they do. I say let the authors of the individual books handle the formatting. Although, we should specify that a book should be formatted in a uniform way (all chapters look the same, etc). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:48, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

: This is just to say that I'm currently working on a wikitex -&gt; pdf converter based on Latex ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/wikipdf/ ). The project is undergoing deep changes, so you might want to use the cvs version (wikipdf-flexbison branch). At the moment, it handles (or tries to):
:* images (they are automatically downloaded from the server when needed)
:* equations
:* references 
:* hyperlinks (both internal and external)
:* templates
:Tables are being implemented. The output of the program is currently very rough (I'm not a programmer...), but I think at the moment is is already useful for someone who wants to generate a pdf version of a book, as it will automatically download all you need (you only have to provide the list of pages you want in your book), and make most of the conversion into latex (and in a sort of XML at the same time).

:there are quite a lot of dependencies, as it uses a wiki -&gt; xml converter written in flex and bison (flexbisonparse, from the mediawiki repository). To use wikipdf, you therefore need: flex, bison, makeutils (for flexbisonparse), python (I work with 2.4), Inkscape or rsvg (to handle svg pictures), imagemagick (for all other pictures formats) and of course LaTeX. It might therefore be easier to make it work under Linux, but it should be portable. 

:If there is an interrest for wikipdf, it should be possible to put a running version on a server to directly generate pdfs or zip files containing the LaTeX file and the corresponding images. 

: Any python enthusiast is of course welcome to speed up the development [[User:CyrilB|CyrilB]] 21:16, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

== New Book:Futurology ? ==

I am a sysop on the [http://future.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page Future Wikia] and as thus I am representing the wikia in asking whether or not I may transport some of the information regarding futurology and predictions to Wikibooks. I've made over a thousand contributions on the Future Wikia and I have had experience as an admin and bureaucrat on the Future Wikia for several months. If it's agreeable to you, I'd also like to apply for admin status on Wikibooks as well. Thank you.--[http://future.wikia.com/wiki/User:Yunzhong_Hou Yunzhong Hou]

:[[v:Wikiversity|Wikiversity]] is a seperate project from Wikibooks these days. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:35, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:Well, how about wikibooks?

:: Admins are voted on here on wikibooks. If the general concensus of voters agree that the said person is good enough or has earned enough trust to be an Admin, a Bureaucrat turns them into an admin. And usually, it takes a while before enough trust is built. We have a good amount of active Admins right now, so I would expect the voting to be a little strict. I do recall one guy who was turned down for Adminship because he &quot;only&quot; had 600 edits for example.

:: It isn't the edit count that counts though. It is how often you participate in catching vandals, and how well you know Wikibooks policy. No offense to you, but you haven't really demonstrated that in any of your posts (maybe you are just not interested in making policy or catching vandals, which is perfectly fine)

:: Adminship isn't that big a deal anyway. If you want a page deleted, just mark it with a {{tl|delete}} tag and be done with it. Deletions are rarely as good as a redirect, and anyone can revert pages. Bannings are done so rarely, and if you are to ever do a ban, you waste hours on the IRC or patroling the RC looking for possible vandals :-p --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:01, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:: I don't know anything about Futurology, but a quick look up on Wikipedia about what Futurology is, suggests its still an evolving science, so it may possibly not qualify as being something likely taught in a college course for example or might be considered original research. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:11, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::: If there are some clearly developed parts of it, then I see no reason why not. There is the [[Lucid Dreaming]] book for instance, which does note when some of its methods are unconfirmed or documented, or are original research. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:20, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:::: Perhaps. I was going by some rule of thumb like &quot;if there's not even enough for an entire article on Wikipedia, then..&quot; which seems to be a good bases for determaning whether or not there's enough information out there to even consider making it a book and enough interest for it to be anything more then a stub. All I found was a paragraph on Futurology describing it as evolving. Hense my comment. I may have misunderstood some exspect of policy, but I think the original research bits in [[Lucid Dreaming]] may need to be removed, since you say that such exists in it. If there is indeed some well establish and clearly developed parts of Futorology I agree that it would be fine here. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:45, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::::: Hmm, I'd hate for that to be so. I mean, it did win BoTM even with those bits in, so I figured that it was one of those exceptions to policy. Lucid Dreaming '''itself''' isn't original research either, so I don't think it is a big deal. I mean, rumors and such do exist in real textbooks anyway, but are clearly marked as rumors. Lucid Dreaming does do that. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 04:50, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:::::: I wasn't suggesting Lucid Dreaming was original research, I was referring to whatever orginal research is contained within the book that may require being removed from it and '''not''' the Lucid Dreaming book itself as possibly needing deleted. You could be right, there might be exceptions to the policy that allow for it which Lucid Dreaming makes use of that I'm not aware of. If it is an exception to the rule, then knowing what the exception is would be good for me to know about. If you think about being professional though, as you are suggesting in another section, rumors and such I think are generally not discussed in textbooks unless it advances some espect of the subject being discussed and inhances the learning experence. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:19, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::::::: Well, I just know that there are a wide variety of textbooks, and not all of them have to be specifically professional. Magic books for example, can easily be considered textbooks. Nonetheless, due to the nature of the material (which is entertainment for fun and profit), it can be significantly less formal than say, a Biology textbook, and still qualify as a Textbook. I can note a Card Tricks book with large amounts of jokes, sarcasm and rumors in the text.
::::::: Lucid Dreaming would fall into this &quot;exception&quot; (kind of) because it is more of a fun subject. It is a very clean, very safe fun subject. Rumors and original research is definitly not allowed in say, Chemestry for obvious reasons of course, which would be the other side of the spectrum. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 05:36, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
::::::::I had always assumed Lucid Dreaming was a simple matter of fact. Not that I've ever done any research on it, but simply because I used to do it quite a bit and sort of came upon the method by sheer accident. I haven't done it in many years, but I would have to say it's quite real. But now that you mention it, I suppose there's really no way to verify it since you can't exactly record someone's dreams and play them back. Oh well, sorry for going off on a tangent, but I was just kind of surprised that there was any skepticism about it. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 06:21, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
:::::::::Oh, I don't think it is skeptical. I have lucid dreamed myself (using the methods in the book. It ain't worth the sleep-paralysis afterwards IMO, but was an interesting experience). But there are parts in the book that say unconfirmed in it. But [[Lucid_Dreaming:_Induction_Techniques#Other_techniques]] suggests original research, but IMO, it isn't that big a problem here. The project has a clear goal, the book in general is focused on proven or documented techniques, and the &quot;others&quot; section adds to the book. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 15:45, 25 November 2006 (UTC)
::::::::::Sorry to continue on this tangent, but what do you mean &quot;sleep paralysis&quot;? As in [[w:Sleep_paralysis|this kind of sleep paralysis]]? I've never experienced that. I actually found lucid dreaming quite addictive.

======reset tabs--futurology======
I've gone through several chapters of this book, and am not comfortable with a lot of it. 
*[[Future/End_of_Civilization]] notes that it's &quot;from wikipedia&quot;, but leaves no link to the article (thus a copyright violation). If the other chapters are being copied from future.wikia without attribution, these are copyvios too.
*Most of the chapters of this book are a ''applications'' of futurology, rather than a discussion of the field and its methods (in fact, they're just predictions, with little or no discussion of method whatsoever). This is precisely the kind of OR/non-textbook sort of materials that the foundation (and specifically Jimbo) doesn't want on wikibooks. 

While a '''textbook''' on the methods, history, and application of futurology might be interesting, this book seems to be nothing but predictions. The copyvio problem is also rather serious, we should probably continue this discussion on VfD, rather than the Staff Lounge. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:47, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== System for adding new wikibooks and suggesting hot picks ==

Hi. I was thinking there should be a unified system for adding new wikibooks and suggesting hot picks, especially for helping new users.

First, I noticed a few newcomers were wondering about editing [[Template talk:New]] to add their new wikibooks.

I recently put a link in the template that says &quot;Start a book&quot; and links to [[Help:How to contribute|Help:How to start a book]]. But as Peterb323 pointed out on the talk page, the explanation to add books doesn't make any sense as written.

&quot;Note: If you are a new user, you cannot place your book on the bookshelf by yourself. Once you add your book to the list new Wikibooks, then someone will put it there for you.&quot;

Since the &quot;Add new Wikibook links &gt;&gt;&quot; text links to editing Template:New (http://en.wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Template:New&amp;action=edit), there is no second list which new user can add their books to. There is only the list in the template.

Therefore, I suggust we just let new users add their own books. (See more explanation for the &quot;add-it-yourself&quot; system below.)

Second, [[Template:Highlighted]] uses a different system, where &quot;Suggest hot picks &gt;&gt;&quot; links to editing Section 3 on the templates talk page to list hot picks (http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Highlighted&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3). Then I guess any of these suggestions may or may not be transferred to the following 7 pages based on the name of the day of the week: ex., [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Monday]], [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Tuesday]], etc. Then the actual day of the week determines which one will appear on [[Template:Highlighted]], which in turn appears on the main page.

I understand a desire to have &quot;rotatable&quot; hightlighted books, but this system seem overly complex, especially for making changes.

Can anyone think of a way of unifying these two systems? In addition, think we should have some easy-to-understand explanation of adding links to new Wikibooks and hot picks for newcomers. Be it either a suggestion based system or add-it-yourself based system.

I personally favor the add-it-yourself system as these templates don't seem to be updated that often as they are now. As stands now, all one needs to do is log in to edit the template. If a book appears on [[Template:New]] or [[Template:Highlighted]] that someone doesn't like, the book link will be on the main page, and the person that doesn't like it can remove the link from the template.

Sorry for such a long explanation, but I feel some change should be made. Thanks, [[User:Hyad|Hyad]] 06:59, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:I dont see why people can't add their own books to a bookshelf, and I agree that people should be able to do that if they know how to do it, and they do it correctly. A big problem however is that bookshelves become flooded with stubs, or even red links to books that were going to be worked, on, but never quite made it.
:I do not agree with you, necessarily, that people should just be adding to the &quot;Hot Picks&quot; list anytime they see fit, or that the process of adding books to that list should be made easier. We don't want every author to just add their new books to that list because that particular author thinks their own work is good (every author thinks thier own books are good). We do need, however, some sort of standardized process for incorporating good books into that list, and making good book stand out from the crowd, but that would be a community effort, and not just something that anybody should be able to do. Maybe we need to create a &quot;Votes for Good Books&quot; page, where books can be nominated to be listed as a &quot;good book&quot;, and the community can vote on it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:47, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

::I agree with Whiteknight. While it's great that individuals have a great deal of control over the content of this site, for things like this, I believe it should be left in the hands of people with a better picture of the site overall instead of their own little niche. For myself, I have interests in several books here, and one more than the others, and that's where my attention is focused. I neither want, nor expect, nor should I be expected, to deal with site-wide issues like that, even as they relate to the book(s) I work on, beyond perhaps consultation from admins/bureaucrats when it affects the content I'm working on. Some jobs are best left to admins and that's what they're there for. I personally feel very strongly that this is something that should stay with admins.
::As Whiteknight points out, individuals working on a book are going to be biased and their judgements can't always be depended on as to whether their work is deserving of being on the &quot;Hot Picks&quot; list. Nothing has made this clearer to me than, in my work on the Organic Chemistry book, to find many chapters marked as 75% or even 100% done, by previous authors when, in my opinion, these chapters are often maybe 25% done, if that. These sorts of judgements should be more objective than the individual authors are capable of. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 18:58, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

:::So, if I'm understanding your responses correctly, an &quot;add-it-yourself&quot; system for [[Template:New]] and the suggestion based system for [[Template:Highlighted]] seems to be the consensus (at least so far). Does anyone having any ideas for improving either or both systems as they stand now? Perhaps, for [[Template:New]] we could provide a clearer explanation of adding links.

:::For [[Template:Highlighted]], I noticed it's kind of hard add any new suggestions. For example, [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Tuesday]] hasn't been touched since the day it was created in June. [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Saturday]] simply redirects to Tuesday. (Check out all the days of the week for yourself: [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Monday]], [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Tuesday]], [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Wednesday]], [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Thursday]], [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Friday]], [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Saturday]], [[Wikibooks:Featured books/Sunday]].) I remember adding a suggestion a while back (it was for [[Programming:Tcl]]) and while it still on the suggestion list, no one has added it, denyed it or said anything. This isn't just mine, I think many of the suggestions since the rotation system was created in June haven't been added unless people add them themselves. And if someone does add a person's suggestion, the original person who made the suggestion wouldn't know which &quot;day of the week&quot; it was added to. Not only that, but many hot pick candidates have not been removed even though they were already added to one of the days of the week pages.

:::Perhaps someone could create a complete list of all the &quot;hot picks&quot; and use some sort of random number generator to randomly select a certain number of links from the list to be displayed on the main page. (I'm not quite sure how feasible this would be with MediaWiki software.) Also, if people want a suggestion based system, perhaps there should be a way for suggestions to &quot;default&quot; to being added (or deleted) if no one makes any comments for adding or removing a hot pick candidate. -[[User:Hyad|Hyad]] 05:48, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

== Need Quick Review ==

Hi, I'm new and would like to make sure I'm doing this right (templates, chapters, formatting, etc.) If someone would be kind enough to give a quick review:
[[Free_Direct_Instruction_Science_1]]
Thanks a ton!

== Afrikaans ==

I may need help to add more information about the language of [[Afrikaans]], also asking anyone to take a look at this and also make sure it's cleaned up properly... [[User:Rakuten06|Rakuten06]] 21:01, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

== Image deletion runs ==
I realise that the image deletion tidy up is essential.  However, done by a user, it effectively wipes out most of my ability to RC patrol first thing.  Would anyone just check thro the RC stuff before and maybe after running the deletions as I guess we are probably missing things.  I can do New Pages easily enough still.  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:59, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
:The problem is that it uses an admin tool, and we don't have any bots with sysop status. The bot part of the job is nearly done :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:38, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
::Yeah but I'm just saying if someone reviews RC before it runs it will catch stuff I'm not getting to (indeed someone may be doing it - I can't see it cos 500 changes only take me back to deletions maybe 2/3 hours back) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:50, 28 November 2006 (UTC)
:::In hind sight, we could have created such an account (an admin account with the bot flag), and shared the password among our active admins to use as necessary. After the job was done, we could have put in a request with the stewards to remove all the privledges from that account. Or, conversely, we could have given the bot flag to on of our current admins, and then removed it when the job was done. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:12, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most important thing you must remember about storing food on a campout is that it should '''never''' be stored in a tent where people will sleep.  Animals ''will'' smell your food, and if it's in your tent, they ''will'' find a way in.  Instead, store the food outside the tent.  

If you have a vehicle available at your campsite, you may store the food inside, but be sure to seal it tightly.  A determined bear ''can'' get inside a locked vehicle, and if he decides that's what he wants to do, the car will sustain heavy damage.  On the other end of the animal spectrum, are mice, which can also enter a locked car - even the trunk.  It is therefore important to seal the food tightly so that the aroma does not draw unwanted attention from unwanted visitors.  

If you do not have a vehicle or a trailer in which to store your food, you may place it in a bag and suspend it at least 15 feet (4.5 meters) above the ground by tying the bag to a rope and hanging it over a tree branch.  Black bears can and do climb trees, so make sure the bag is well out of their reach - away from the trunk, and at least 4 feet (1.2 m) below the branch from which it is suspended.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Make sure you clean your cooking utensils thoroughly as soon as your meal is over.  Raccoons will sneak into a camp full of people distracted by tending their campfire and carry away your utensils so they may lick your ladles clean.  The only problem is that they almost never return them.  Ants an other insects may not abscound with your gear, but you do not want them crawling all over your spatulas either.

      <text xml:space="preserve">First you will need a bed of coals.  If you attempt to bake your bread over a flame, it will be burned on the outside and raw on the inside.  Make the bread dough or bring a frozen tube of pre-made dough.  Get a straight stick {{units|100-130cm|3-4 feet}} long and clean the end of it off.  You can do this by removing the bark or by washing it in clean water.  Wrap the dough in a thin layer around the stick, spiralling it as you go.  The dough should cover the top {{units|10-15cm|4-6 inches}} of the stick.  Once the dough is secured to the stick, jam the other end of the stick into the ground or support it with rocks or large pieces of firewood, so that the bread is held over the coals.  The bread dough should be held at a distance from the coals where it is uncomfortably hot to hold your hand.  Turn the stick every couple of minutes until the outside is golden brown (this is why you need a ''straight'' stick).  You can eat the bread right off the stick.  This is an excellent early morning activity while everyone is tying to warm up around the fire.  It works equally well at night.

[[Help:Welcome, newcomers|Welcome to Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks! You don't have to [[Special:Userlogin|log in]] to read or edit articles on Wikibooks, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and gives you many benefits, including:
*The use of a username of your choice
*The ability to view all your contributions via a &quot;My contributions&quot; link 
*Your own [[wikipedia:user page|user page]] 
*Your own talk page which, if you choose, also allows users to send you messages without knowing your e-mail address
*The use of your own personal [[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]] to which you can add articles that interest you
*The ability to rename pages.
*The ability to [[Special:Upload|upload images]] 
*The ability to customize the appearance and behavior of the website
*The eligibility to become an [[Help:Administrators|administrator]] 
*The right to be heard in votes and elections
*Your IP address will no longer be visible to other users.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and '''[[Special:Userlogin|create an account]]'''. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have on my talk page. By the way, make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes ('''&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;'''), which will let others know who left it.

 --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

== Naming ==
The page you are working [[Islam Way of Life|Islam:Way of Life]] on is not named in accordance with policy here.  Corrent naming would be either [[Islam/Way of Life]] with Way of life as a sub page or [[Islam Way of Life]] without any punctuations.  Please let me know which would be best &amp; I will rename it.  It really would be better if you created an account --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:15, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

Dear Herby,
I am fully aware of the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].
But, as far I know, &quot;Islam&quot; is a namespace and a namespace precede a wikibook title with colon (&quot;:&quot;).
A good example is Wikibooks:Naming Policy.

That is my preferred choice. This is because in real world, &quot;Islam&quot; has many factions.
And I don't they will not collaborate to create one wikibook called &quot;Islam&quot; with several pages, such as &quot;Islam/Way of Life&quot;

So, you can rename the page anytime to conform the Naming policy.
Here my preferences, from the best to the worst:
# Islam:Way of Life
# Islam/Way of Life
# Islam Way of Life

If you choose the preference number 2, please rename as well the following books.
* Islam:Law of Nature
* Islam:Spirituality
* Islam:Legislation
* Islam:Civilization

I wish you keep the preference 1. But if not, I am fully support of enforcing policies anyway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:38, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

=Welsh=

Hi AledJames, it's Kijog here, thanks for your edits on mutations and the rest etc... it would have taken me ages to have done all that! I'm only a learner, whereas you're a native speaker so please look out for poor Welsh on my part... My wish list is to have a series of lessons as well as the grammar section we already have. I'm going to put what I think is a rough lessonplan on the Welsh Talk page in the near future, so we can discuss what should go in or not before we start writing them. Anything in particular you want to see? [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 10:24, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

-------
Perhaps for each lesson:

1) Some simple phrases
2) Vocabulary
3) Some grammar, ie sentence structures
4) Some exercises

That's roughly how &quot;Teach yourself&quot; did it (the 1970's editions)

== Naming ==
OK - I was not aware that Islam was a namespace in its own right.  I'll run than past more experienced folk.  Thanks and genuinely welcome --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 10:45, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

:It does not have a namespace. The only project with a full namespace right now is the [[Cookbook]] (though [[Wikijunior]] has a pseudo-namespace). Your book should be in the main namespace, following normal conventions. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:20, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Hi All, please read my reasoning [[User_talk:194.7.217.5#Naming | here]]. But, on top of that, I fully support efforts to enforce policy. [[User:Aburizal|Aburizal]] 11:30, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Ah I see... I agree with your resaoning there... [[Islam]] should probably just be a bookshelf page with a list of all the books on the subject... I'll work on that this evening. If I could suggest a title, maybe &quot;[[The Islamic Way of Life]]&quot;? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:07, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: Bookshelf for Islam? May be a good idea, as long as there is another religion has already a bookshelf. 

:::: The title you suggested is truly grammatically correct. But, unfortunately being grammatically correct is not the major purpose of the title. The main purpose for this particular book are:
:::: 1. Short, familiar and descriptive
:::: 2. Strong relation with another book &quot;Islam:Law of Nature&quot;

:::: How about &quot;Islamic Way of Life&quot; and &quot;Islamic Law of Nature&quot;? 
:::: The runner-up are &quot;Koranic Way of Life&quot; and &quot;Koranic Law of Nature&quot;.

:::: I have made similar mistake with [[Islam Way of Life Explained|Islam:Way of Life:Keywords]], please rename it to &quot;Whatever we chose above/Keywords&quot;
:::: [[User:Aburizal|Aburizal]] 12:26, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

:::::They all look good... however you want to do it (you're the author, not me). We can move the other one to the regular naming policy. 
:::::As for other religions having pseufo-bookshelves: I don't see any, but there should be. The book [[Christianity]], for example, should probably be broken into different books for the many sects of Christianity. Books on Hinduism and Buddhism would have the same issues, since they also have radically differing sects. The thing is we haven't had all that many books on religion yet, because it's hard to find people who are both interested in contributing ''and'' willing or able to write NPOV books on the subject (which is understandable, of course). But, wikibooks is still young, and I have no doubt that this section will be more developed over time. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:46, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

'''Untermensch''' ([[German language|German]] for ''under man'', ''sub-man'', ''sub-human''; plural: Untermenschen) is a term from [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[racism|racial]] [[ideology]] used to describe supposedly inferior people, especially &quot;the masses from the East,&quot; that is [[Jewish ethnic divisions#Europe|Eastern European Jews]] and Soviet [[Bolshevist]]s (with the two groups often described as being less or more congruent in Nazi [[propaganda]]).

== The origins of the term &quot;Untermensch&quot; ==

Although usually considered to have been coined by the Nazis themselves, the term &quot;under man&quot; in (less or more) the above mentioned sense was actually first used by American author [[Lothrop Stoddard]] in the title of his 1922 pamphlet ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man''. It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Domenico Losurdo]], “Toward a Critique of the Category of Totalitarianism”, ''Historical Materialism'' 12.2 (April 2004), p.25-55, here p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The German word &quot;Untermensch&quot; itself had been used earlier (not in a racial sense), e.g. in a 1899 novel by [[Theodor Fontane]]. Since most writers who employ the term do not address the question of when and how the word entered the German language (and therefore do not seem to be aware of Stoddard's original term &quot;under man&quot;), &quot;Untermensch&quot; is usually back-translated into English as &quot;sub-human.&quot; A leading Nazi attributing the concept of the [[Eastern Europe|East-European]] &quot;under man&quot; to Stoddard is [[Alfred Rosenberg]] who, referring to Russian communists, wrote in his ''Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts'' (1930) that &quot;this is the kind of human being that Lothrop Stoddard has called the 'under man.'&quot; [&quot;...den Lothrop Stoddard als 'Untermenschen' bezeichnete.&quot;]&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Rosenberg, ''Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts: Eine Wertung der seelischgeistigen Gestaltungskämpfe unserer Zeit'', München: Hoheneichen, 1930, here p.214.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Stoddard: ''&quot;The Under-Man -- the man who measures under the standards of capacity and adaptability imposed by the social order in which he lives''.

However, it is possible that Stoddard constructed his &quot;under man&quot; as an antipode to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[Übermensch]] (or superman) concept. Stoddard doesn't say so explicitly, but he refers critically to the &quot;superman&quot; idea at the end of his book (p.262). Wordplays with Nietzsche's term seem to have been used repeatedly as early as the 19th century and, due to the German linguistic trait of being able to combine [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]] and [[root]]s almost at will in order to create new words, this development was even somewhat logical. For instance, German author [[Theodor Fontane]] contrasts the Übermensch/Untermensch word pair in his novel ''Der Stechlin'' (1898, see Chapter 33). As a matter of fact, even Nietzsche himself used &quot;Untermensch&quot; at least once in contrast to &quot;[[Übermensch]]&quot; (''Die fröhliche Wissenschaft'' [1882], 3rd book, Chapter 143) but this bears no resemblance to the Untermensch in later thought. Earlier examples of &quot;Untermensch&quot; include Romanticist [[Jean Paul]] using the term in his novel ''Hesperus '' (1795) in reference to an [[Orangutan]] (Chapter &quot;8. Hundposttag&quot;).

Stoddard's book-long diatribe dealt with the recent takeover of power by the [[Bolsheviks]] in [[Russia]], arguing that that country was now ruled by the most degenerate people on the Earth. He thought that the combination of the alleged inherent racial inferiority of Russian [[Slavs]], the idiocy of a political creed that appealed to the vilest human instincts (e.g. jealousy towards the more gifted and the more affluent) and the supposed fact that the [[Communist Party]]'s [[rank and file]] consisted of &quot;born criminals&quot; in the most conventional sense of the word necessitated a completely new term to describe this phenomenon: &quot;the under man.&quot; In this sense, for Stoddard, the [[October Revolution]] was the battle cry for an upcoming, unavoidable clash of the civilized nations with the &quot;masses of the east.&quot; If the white race was intent upon winning that confrontation with the &quot;under man,&quot; so the message went, it had to turn away from ill-conceived liberal ideas and adopt drastic changes of policy instead, e.g. by introducing far-ranging [[eugenics]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Lothrop Stoddard, ''The Revolt against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man'', New York: C. Sribner's Sons, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

The available literature on Nazi Germany would not support the claim that Stoddard's writings were more to the Nazis than a neat summary of racial, social, and political theories that already were or would soon become part and parcel of the Nazis' ideology.

== The &quot;Untermensch&quot; in Nazi propaganda and policy ==

Nazis believed that [[Jews]], [[Slavs]], [[Roma people|Gypsies]], [[Altaic people]]s or [[Black (people)|Africans]], and ''asocial element'', as well as the mentally or physically [[Disability|disabled]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[criminals]], [[Prostitution|prostitutes]], [[beggar]]s, [[Itinerant|tramps]], [[liberals]], political [[dissident]]s, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and so-called ''morally degenerates'' were subhuman. 

The term &quot;Untermensch&quot; was utilized repeatedly in writings and speeches directed against the Jews, the most notorious example being a 1935 SS publication with the title &quot;Der Untermensch&quot; which contains an [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]] [[tirade]] sometimes considered to be an extract from a speech held by [[Heinrich Himmler]]. In the pamphlet ''The SS as an Anti-bolshevist Fighting Organization'', Himmler wrote in [[1936]]: ''We shall take care that never again in Germany, the heart of Europe, will the Jewish-Bolshevistic revolution of '''subhumans''' be able to be kindled either from within or through emissaries from without.''[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/ssnur1.htm]

One more example for using the term &quot;Untermensch,&quot; this time in connection with anti-Soviet propaganda, is another brochure, again titled &quot;Der Untermensch&quot; and edited by Himmler. Published in 1942 after the start of [[Operation Barbarossa]], it is around fifty pages long and consists for the most part of photos casting an extremely negative light on the enemy (see link below for the title page). Historian Robert Jan van Pelt writes that for the Nazis, &quot;it was only a small step to a rhetoric pitting the European Mensch against the Soviet Untermensch, which had come to mean a Russian in the clutches of [[Judeo-Bolshevism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Jan van Pelt, &quot;From Architect's Promise to Inmate's Perdition,&quot; ''Modernism/Modernity'' 1.1 (1994), p. 80-120, here p.97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the Soviet &quot;Untermensch&quot; in particular served the Nazis as justification for their [[genocide|genocidal]] policies and especially their aggression against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1941]] in order to conquer ''[[Lebensraum]]''. Early plans of the German Reich (summarized as [[Generalplan Ost]]) envisaged the displacement, enslavement, and elimination of no less than 50 million people who were not considered fit for [[Germanization]] from territories it wanted to conquer in Eastern Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Holocaust denial''' or Holocaust revisionism as referred to by its supporters, is the belief that the history of the Holocaust as is commonly told is not correct or complete, more specifically some of the points defended are: that far fewer than around six million Jews were killed by the Nazis (numbers below one million, most often around 30,000 are typically cited); that there never was a centrally-planned Nazi attempt to exterminate the Jews; and/or that there were not mass killings at the extermination camps.

As the Holocaust is generally considered by historians to be one of the most documented events in recent history, these views are not accepted as credible by scholars, with organizations such as the American Historical Association, the largest society of historians in the United States, stating that Holocaust denial is &quot;at best, a form of academic fraud&quot;[49], nevertheless it would be naive to rely only on the &quot;victors&quot; recount of history and dismiss the long effect of war propaganda and indeed some more extremist movements, especially those that defend Zionism in using the event to promote their views and goals. 

Holocaust deniers almost always prefer to be called Holocaust revisionists. Historical revisionism, in the original sense of the word, is a well-accepted and mainstream part of the study of history; it is the reexamination of accepted history, with an eye towards updating it with newly discovered, more accurate, and/or less biased information, or viewing known information from a new perspective. Claiming that revisionists deny the Holocaust is misleading, it puts all views against the status quo in a single label and simplifies it to the absurdity of negating the event.

Holocaust revisionists often further claim that Jews and/or Zionists know that the Holocaust never occurred as is commonly described, yet that they are engaged in a massive conspiracy to maintain the illusion of a Holocaust to further their political agenda. Claiming that the Holocaust is only about the capture and the genocide of Jews is an extremely partial view of the event, since it included millions of people in other groups, including Romani, Soviet prisoners of war, Polish and Soviet civilians, homosexuals, people with disabilities, Jehovah's Witnesses and other political and religious opponents, which occurred regardless of whether they were of German or non-German ethnic origin.

== Methods used by &quot;Negationists&quot;/&quot;Revisionists&quot; ==
Much of the controversy surrounding the claims of &quot;Holocaust deniers&quot; centers upon the methods used to present arguments that the Holocaust allegedly never happened. Numerous accounts have been given (including evidence presented in court cases) of claimed &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot;; however, independent research has shown these claims to be based upon flawed research, biased statements, and even deliberately falsified evidence. Opponents of &quot;Holocaust denial&quot; have compiled detailed accounts of numerous instances where this evidence has been altered or manufactured (see below, also see Nizkor Project). Evidence presented by Holocaust deniers has also failed to stand up to scrutiny in courts of law (see Fred A. Leuchter and David Irving), as well as never meeting the standards of independent peer-reviewed journals. 

Ken McVay, an activist who works to counter such claims on the Internet, described the ''modus operandi'' of &quot;Holocaust deniers&quot; in a 1994 interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They'll cite a historical text: 'K.K. Campbell says on page 82 of his famous book that nobody died at Auschwitz.' Then you go to the Library of Congress and look up K.K. Campbell, page 82, and what you find he really said was, 'It was a nice day at Dachau.' They get away with this because they know goddamn well most people don't have time to rush off to the Library of Congress. But people read that and say to themselves, 'Who would lie about such a thing when it's so easy to prove them wrong? They must be telling the truth.'&quot; -- ''Eye'' magazine (online Web-based magazine), November 10, 1994&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some cases, while some facts presented are sound, the application of those facts to specific arguments is meaningless or distorted. For example, a plaque placed by the Soviet authorities at Auschwitz read that 4 million people had been killed at the death camp. Western historians never believed that figure, as estimates of the number of people killed at Auschwitz were consistently estimated at 1-1.5 million people. After the fall of the Communist government of Poland, the plaque was changed to 1.1 million victims. Holocaust deniers frequently argue that this proves that the numbers of the Holocaust were exaggerated, when the plaque was never part of any historian's calculations of victims at Auschwitz.[http://www.nizkor.org/features/techniques-of-denial/four-million-02.html]

In other cases it appears as though the conflation of facts is used to mislead. A frequently-used photo shows a fairly flimsy gas chamber door. The intent is to confuse the inept reader into believing that gas chambers could not be practically used for extermination, because the victims would break down the door rather than be executed. While the photo is a real gas chamber door, it is not a door that was known to be used on an extermination gas chamber; it is a door likely used on a de-lousing gas chamber.

==&quot;Negationism&quot; as anti-Semitism==
Many publications and statements by Holocaust deniers have been marked by anti-Semitism. Critics of Holocaust denial have cited many examples where the arguments and proffered evidence have moved from neutral, scholarly presentations to blatant promotion of [[anti-Semitic]] ideas and conspiracy theories. As a brief search of the Internet for such terms will reveal, Holocaust deniers have frequently used terms such as &quot;Zionist Collaborator&quot; or &quot;Jew-lover&quot; to describe their opponents. On some internet forums, such as the comments page on YouTube, users claiming to be &quot;revisionists&quot; are so blatantly anti-Semitic that they use terms such as &quot;Zionist liars.&quot; On the comments page for a YouTube video titled 'Auschwitz II - The Birkenau Experience: Journey into Hell,' one such user went as far as saying: &quot;Behind every misery, war, lie, deception, bank, greed, and war crime, there is a motherfucking sub-human Jewish retard.&quot;

The continuing, persistent efforts by Holocaust deniers to portray mass killings as a mere fiction in the face of overwhelming evidence has led scholars and authorities to question their motives. &quot;Why,&quot; it has been asked, &quot;do people deny the Holocaust?&quot; On July 24, 1996, a missive by Harold Covington (the leader of the National Socialist White People's Party) was sent via email to a number of neo-Nazi supporters (many of whom were Holocaust deniers). In this message, Covington explained Holocaust denial in a manner that has been used by its opponents and critics as a definitive answer to the question of ''why:''

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Take away the Holocaust and what do you have left? Without their precious Holocaust, what are the Jews? Just a grubby little bunch of international bandits and assassins and squatters who have perpetrated the most massive, cynical fraud in human history...I recall seeing a television program on revisionism a few years ago which closed with Deborah Lipstadt making some statement to the effect that: ''the real purpose of Holocaust revisionism is to make [[Nazism|National Socialism]] an acceptable political alternative again.'' I normally don't agree with anything a Jew says, but I recall exclaiming, 'Bingo! Got it in one! Give that lady a cigar!'&quot; -- &quot;On Revisionism&quot; by Harold Covington (writing under the pseudonym Winston Smith), ''NSNet Bulletin #5,'' July 24, 1996&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Burden of proof==
&quot;Holocaust denial&quot; is widely viewed as unreasonable because it has been observed many times that &quot;Holocaust denial,&quot; or &quot;negationism,&quot; fails to adhere to rules for the treatment of evidence, rules that are recognized as basic to rational inquiry.

To support a proposition or allegation, a claimant must offer evidence. The merits of this evidence, and the conclusion it can support, will depend on its nature; for example, hearsay would not normally be considered good evidence, but an eyewitness account would be. A second-hand story would not, but an official, dated and signed document testifying to the alleged incident would be. After evidence has been adduced, the claimant's case is then considered to have been made, and the evidence can be evaluated. The claimant's burden of proof has been carried. If an interlocutor would then like to call the claimant's evidence into question, that interlocutor will have to make a claim of his own -- for example, that this or that piece of evidence is a forgery. The burden of proof then shifts to the interlocutor, and the standard of proof will be commensurate with the surety with which the original claim was established. The claimant's evidence has, prima facie, whatever force it has in virtue of its merit as evidence. The interlocutor can't simply continue demanding more proof to answer any conceivable skeptical conjecture or hypothetical possibility he can invent to challenge the claimant; this raises the claimant's burden of proof to an unreasonable level.

In the case of the Holocaust, the survivors, eye witnesses, and historians may collectively be considered the claimants. The prevailing consensus among the informed is that their evidence is overwhelming, and that it proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the Holocaust occurred, and that it occurred as they say it occurred. It is unreasonable to ask the claimants to prove that their evidence is &quot;really real&quot; any more than they already have, unless there is some particular demonstrably credible reason for thinking that it is suspect. If &quot;negationists&quot; would like to cast doubt on this evidence, the burden of proof shifts to them, and they will have a very high standard to meet. They would have to prove, at least with a balance of probabilities, that the greater part of the entire body of evidence attesting to the Holocaust has been fabricated, misrepresented, or misconstrued by thousands upon thousands of critical evaluators. Until they can do that, they have not satisfied the rules for the treatment of evidence recognized to be integral to reason. In the meantime, &quot;Holocaust denial&quot; will continue to be recognized as an unreasonable position.

All of this makes &quot;negationism&quot; different from conspiracy theories generally speaking, since the latter aspire to play by the rules of evidence, but the evidence they adduce is judged poor. Holocaust deniers attempt to set unreasonable standards for evidence, so that they can judge the historian's evidence as poor. This is why &quot;negationists&quot; portray Holocaust scholarship as a conspiracy theory. Still, Holocaust denial is often accompanied by a conspiracy theory of a different sort, namely that Holocaust scholars are conspiring to depict what they allege to be a fictional event as if it were fact.

== Evidence of the Holocaust ==

Evidence of the existence of the Holocaust was well documented by the heavily bureaucratic German government itself. It was further well documented by the Allied forces who entered Germany and its associated Axis states towards the end of World War II. Among the evidence produced was film and stills of the existence of prisoner camps, as well as the testimony of those freed when the camps were entered. 

The Holocaust was a massive undertaking that lasted for years across several countries, with its own command and control infrastructure. Although the Nazis made attempts to destroy the evidence of the Holocaust when they could see that their defeat was imminent, they left many tons of documents relating to the Holocaust. Due to the extremely rapid collapse of the Nazi forces at the end of the war, attempts to destroy evidence in Germany were for the most part unsuccessful.

After their defeat, many tons of documents were recovered, and many thousands of bodies were found not yet completely decomposed, in mass graves near many concentration camps. The physical evidence and the documentary proof included records of train shipments of Jews to the camps, orders for tons of cyanide and other poisons, and the remaining concentration camp structures. Interviews with survivors completed the picture. 

As a result of the records produced, all mainstream historians agree that Holocaust denial is contrary to the facts of history.

=== Evidence for Hitler's complicity in the Holocaust ===
: ''Argument: There was no specific order by Adolf Hitler or other top Nazi officials to exterminate the Jews.''

[[Image:Himmler report.jpg|thumb|right|Report to Hitler detailing the executions of prisoners.]]

Holocaust deniers often cite the fact that there was never a blatant, unquestionable order written or signed by Adolf Hitler that specifically ordered the death of the Jewish populations of Germany or Poland. Critics counter this argument by noting that very few Nazi documents used such obvious terms as &quot;murder&quot; or &quot;death&quot; when addressing their actions. Almost always, they spoke and wrote with suggestive phrases such as &quot;the final solution to the Jewish question&quot; rather than &quot;the destruction of the Jewish people.&quot; The most often-cited quotation from Hitler regarding the intention to eliminate the European Jewry comes from his January 30, 1939 speech to the Reichstag, where he is quoted as saying:
:&quot;Today I want to be a prophet once more: If international Jewish financiers inside and outside Europe again succeed in plunging the nations into a world war, the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth and with it the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe.&quot; (Source: [http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/149.html])

Provided here is a photographic image of a report from Himmler to Hitler regarding the executions of 363,211 Jewish prisoners in Nazi-occupied Białystok, Poland. This was presented as evidence during the ''Trials of War Criminals Before the Nürnberg Military Tribunals'', of Hitler's knowledge and approval of the executions of Jews and other targeted groups. A translation of the report can be found by clicking on the image.

=== Evidence that gas chambers were used for killing ===
: ''Argument: Nazis did not use gas chambers to mass murder Jews. Small chambers did exist for delousing and Zyklon-B was used in this process.''

There have been claims by Holocaust deniers that the gas chambers built to massacre civilians never existed, and the structures identified as gas chambers actually served other purposes. 

One such claim, is that the &quot;alleged&quot; gas chambers at Auschwitz where actually morgues. However, much evidence contradicts the assertion that these chambers where in fact morgues. An inventory discovered after the liberation of the Auschwitz camp, revealed fourteen shower heads and one gas-tight door listed for the cellar in Krema III. On top of all of this, a memo prepared by the Auschwitz construction office on March 31, 1943 is available which reads:


&quot;We take this occasion to refer to another order of March 6, 1943, for the delivery of a gas door 100/192 for Leichenkeller 1 of Krema III, Bw 30a, which is to be built in the manner and according to the same measure as the cellar door of the opposite Krema II, with peep hole of double 8 millimeter glass encased in rubber. This order is to be viewed as especially urgent.&quot;


&quot;Revisionists&quot; have yet to offer any credible explanation as to why a morgue would have an &quot;urgent&quot; need for 14 shower heads and one gas-tight door equipt with rubber encased peepholes made out of a double layer of 8 millimeter thick glass, especially in a room that is not connected to running water (as pointed out by Jean Claude Pressac.) 

To add to this, another document, a memo from the Auschwitz construction office, dated January 29, 1943, explicitly refers to the cellar of Krema II as a &quot;Vergasungskeller,&quot; or &quot;gassing cellar,&quot; which most likely refers to an underground gas chamber. Holocaust denier Arthur Butz once claimed that &quot;Vergasung&quot; cannot refer to killing people with gas, but only to the process of converting a solid or liquid into gas. Therefore, he says the &quot;Vergasungskeller,&quot; must have been a special room where the fuel for the Auschwitz ovens was converted into gas -- a &quot;gasification cellar.&quot; However, this is invalid, given the fact that the Auschwitz ovens where fueled using solid fuel, specifically coke, and therefore did not require any gasification processess what so ever.  

Due to the fact that this argument has fallen under intense scrutiny and failed to withstand, &quot;revisionists&quot; have started to alter their story. The majority of &quot;revisionists&quot; now claim that gas was not used to murder Jews and other victims, and that many gas chambers were also built after the war just for show. An often-quoted document advancing this theory is the &quot;Leuchter Report&quot; by Fred A. Leuchter, a paper stating that no traces of cyanide were found when he examined samples taken from one of the Auschwitz gas chambers in 1988. This paper is used to further a common debating tactic, namely the suggestion that because no traces of cyanide were found in 1988, then no cyanide was used at all in Auschwitz, over forty years earlier. Even with the difficulty of finding traces of this material 50 years later, in February of 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, Director of the Institute of Forensic Research in Kraków, redid the analysis.[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/] Markiewicz and his team used microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the suspected gas chambers, from delousing chambers, and from control areas elsewhere within Auschwitz. The control samples tested negative, while cyanide residue was found in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers. The amount of cyanide found had a great variability (possibly due to 50 years of exposure to the elements to varying degrees[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/polish/institute-for-forensic-research/table-seven.html]), but even so, the categorical results were that cyanide was found where expected, and not in the control samples.

The cyanide used in Auschwitz and other extermination camps was created through activation of the pesticide Zyklon B, which was used to exterminate prisoners by the thousands. Further investigation into the death camps revealed that the most difficult part of the operation was the disposal of thousands of corpses after the executions had taken place; this required the construction of huge ovens to cremate the corpses.

Another claim made by Holocaust deniers is that there were no vents in the gas chambers through which Zyklon B could be inserted, in the words of Leuchter, &quot;No holes - no Holocaust.&quot; The BBC offers a response showing that this requires disregard of much documentation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Deniers have said for years that physical evidence is lacking because they have seen no holes in the roof of the Birkenau gas chamber where the Zyklon was poured in. (In some of the gas chambers the Zyklon B was poured in through the roof, while in others it was thrown in through the windows.) The roof was dynamited at war's end, and today lies broken in pieces, but three of the four original holes were positively identified in a recent paper. Their location in the concrete matches with eyewitness testimony, aerial photos from 1944, and a ground photo from 1943. The physical evidence shows unmistakably that the Zyklon holes were cast into the concrete when the building was constructed.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/genocide/deniers_06.shtml]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another piece of evidence Holocaust deniers frequently question is what happened to the ash after the bodies were cremated (see, for example the IHR's list of questions about the Holocaust). The amount of ash produced in the cremation of a person is about a shoebox full, and disposing of it was not difficult. Aerial photographs of Auschwitz indicate that some ash was piled into the nearby river and marsh, and there is well-documented evidence that other ash was used as fertilizer in nearby fields. Photographs of Treblinka taken by the camp commandant show ash piles being distributed by steam shovels.

A number of other common Holocaust denial claims about gas chambers rely on misdirection, similar to the Auschwitz plaque example given above.  For example, the [[Institute for Historical Review]] has claimed that Holocaust testimony on gas chambers is unreliable, because, in the words of the IHR: &quot;Hoss said in his confession that his men would smoke cigarettes as they pulled the dead Jews out of the gas chambers ten minutes after gassing. Isn't Zyklon-B explosive? Highly so. The Hoss confession is obviously false.&quot; This claim is clearly false, as the Nizkor Project and other sources has pointed out, the minimal concentration of Zyklon-B to be explosive is 56,000 parts per million, while the amount used to kill a human is 300 parts per million, as is evidenced in any common reference guide to chemicals, such as the &quot;The Merck Index&quot; and the &quot;CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics&quot;. In fact, the Nazis' own documentation stated &quot;Danger of explosion: 75 grams of HCN in 1 cubic meter of air. Normal application approx. 8-10 grams per cubic meter, therefore not explosive.&quot; (Nuremberg document NI-9912)

Another example is the claim that &quot;at Birkenau (part of Auschwitz), on the site of the so-called gas chamber and incinerator, there is not nearly enough rubble to represent the remains of a building that size.&quot; Historians point out that after liberation the local Polish farming population returned, and, needing materials to rebuild houses before winter, removed large amounts of re-usable bricks from the ruins. There is by the crematorium site a big pile of waste that the salvagers threw aside as they searched for usable bricks.

The Institute for Historical Review publicly offered a reward of $50,000 for verifiable &quot;proof that gas chambers for the purpose of killing human beings existed at or in Auschwitz.&quot; Mel Mermelstein, a survivor of Auschwitz, submitted proof, which was then ignored. He then sued IHR and won the $50,000 reward, plus $40,000 in damages for personal suffering as well as having the court declare the occurrence of the Holocaust a legally indisputable fact.

=== Evidence for the death toll ===
Argument: The figure of six million Jewish deaths is an irresponsible exaggeration, and many Jews who actually emigrated to Russia, Britain, Israel and the United States are included in the number.

====Six million figure====
The figure &quot;six million&quot; (which refers only to Jewish victims, and is larger when counting the other ethnic, religious, and minority groups targeted for extinction) is often downgraded by claims to a figure of only one million deaths, or only three hundred thousand &quot;casualties.&quot; Numerous documents archived and discovered after the war gave meticulous accounts of the exterminations that took place at the &quot;death camps&quot; (such as Auschwitz and Treblinka). Deniers claim that these documents are based on Soviet propaganda, primarily from Ilya Ehrenburg's Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, and are therefore unreliable.

Complicating the matter is that various instances have been reported where the death tolls of particular death camps were claimed to be overstated. Any possible ambiguity in death toll figures has been seized upon by deniers as evidence for their position. Deniers make the mistake of trying to show that debate on the exact number of deaths is somehow evidence that no one died at all.  Nevertheless, the evidence for the large death figures quoted by mainstream sources is overwhelming.

A much-quoted instance of disputing the toll is the &quot;Breitbard Document&quot; (actually a paper by Aaron Breitbart), [http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/resources/education/revision/] which describes a commemorative plaque at Auschwitz to the victims that died there, which read, ''Four million people suffered and died here at the hands of the Nazi murderers between the years 1940 and 1945.'' In 1990, a new plaque replaced the old one. It now says, ''May this place where the Nazis assassinated 1,500,000 men, women and children, a majority of them Jews from diverse European countries, be forever for mankind a cry of despair and of warning.'' The lower numbers are due to the fact that the Soviets &quot;purposely overstated the number of non-Jewish casualties at Auschwitz-Birkenau,&quot; according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Holocaust deniers seize on this discrepancy and insist that the number of Jews killed must be immediately brought down at least 2.5 million. If their presumption that historians had used this statistic to reach their overall estimate was correct and that all demographical statistics where inaccurate they would be partly right, however, they ignore the facts that
*The 4,000,000 figure of the Soviets included almost 2,000,000 non-Jews.
*Historians rarely if at all used the 4,000,000 figure in calculating the total number of Jews killed.
*The widely quoted figure of &quot;six million&quot; was actually achieved through the use of demographical statistics, rather than by tallying the number of casualties per camp.

==== Jewish population ====
Deniers consider one of their stronger arguments to be the population of Jews before and after the Holocaust. They claim that the 1940 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 15,319,359, while the 1949 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 15,713,638. In their view this makes it impossible that 6 million Jews died, even given an extremely high birth rate. They therefore claim that either the figures are wrong, or the Holocaust, meaning the deliberate extermination of millions of Jews, cannot have happened.

In fact, contrary to the claims of &quot;revisionists,&quot; the 1949 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 11,266,600. Moreover, it revises its estimate of the World Jewish population in 1939 upwards, to 16,643,120. Thus, according to the 1949 World Almanac the difference between the pre and post war populations is approximately 5,376,520. 

In addition, rather than using more accurate census figures and other records, Holocaust deniers rely on a popular compendium whose methodology of assessment is unknown, and whose estimates have varied significantly. For example, the 1982 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 14,318,000, while the 1990 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 18,169,000, and the 1996 World Almanac gives the world Jewish population as 13,451,000. Either 3.7 million Jews appeared unnoticed between 1982 and 1990, and then 4.5 million Jews disappeared equally unnoticed between 1990 and 1996, or the World Almanac is not a particularly reliable source for accurate estimates of worldwide Jewish population.

Finally, Holocaust deniers are often very subjective when citing sources; other sources give very different figures for the Jewish population before and after the war. For example, the 1932 American Jewish yearbook estimate the total number of Jews in the world at 15,192,218, of whom 9,418,248 resided in Europe. However, the 1947 yearbook states: &quot;Estimates of the world Jewish population have been assembled by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (except for the United States and Canada) and are probably the most authentic available at the present time. The figures reveal that the total Jewish population of the world has decreased by one-third from about 16,600,000 in 1939 to about 11,000,000 in 1946 as the result of the annihilation by the Nazis of more than five and a half million European Jews. In Europe only an estimated 3,642,000 remain of the total Jewish pre-war population of approximately 9,740,000.&quot;

This subjectivity, commonly stemming from biases or selectivity of available sources, usually means that Holocaust deniers often ignore the documents produced by the Nazis themselves, who used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the Wannsee Conference.  In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the Korherr Report, which gave the status of the Final Solution through December, 1942:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The total number of Jews in the world in 1937 is generally estimated at around 17 million, thereof more than 10 million in Europe... From 1937 to the beginning of 1943 the number of Jews, partially due to the excess mortality of the Jews in Central and Western Europe, partially due to the evacuations especially in the more strongly populated Eastern Territories which are here counted as off-going, should have diminished by an estimated 4 million. It must not be overlooked in this respect that of the deaths of Soviet Russian Jews in the occupied Eastern territories only a part was recorded, whereas deaths in the rest of European Russia and at the front are not included at all.... On the whole European Jewry should since 1933, i.e. in the first decade of National Socialist German power, have lost almost half of its population.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nazi documentation===
[[Image:Hoefletelegram.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Höfle Telegram.]]
The Nazis themselves documented many of their crimes. For example, the Höfle Telegram sent by SS-Sturmbannführer Hermann Höfle on January 11, 1943 to SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann in Berlin listed 1,274,166 Jews killed in the four camps of Aktion Reinhard during 1942 alone, while the Korherr Report compiled by an SS statistician, gave a conservative total of 2,454,000 Jews deported to extermination camps or killed by the Einsatzgruppen. The complete status reports of the Einsatzgruppen death squads were found in the archives of the Gestapo when it was searched by the U.S. Army, and the accuracy attested to by the former Einsatzgruppen members who testified during war crime trials and at other times. These reports alone list an additional 1,500,000 or so murders during mass shootings, the vast majority of these victims were Jews. Further, surviving Nazi documentation spells out their plans to murder the Jews of Europe (see the Wannsee Conference), recorded the trains arriving at various death camps, and included photographs and films of many atrocities.

====Testimonies====
The most telling evidence is the testimony of thousands of survivors of the Holocaust, as well as the testimony of captured Nazi officers at the Nuremberg Trials and other times. Holocaust deniers discount these testimonies claiming that these witnesses were tortured, or that Rudolf Hoess allegedly signed a &quot;blood stained confession&quot; written in a language he did not understand (English) or that the Nuremberg Trial did not follow proper judicial procedures. This argument again ignores publicly available material, including the fact that Hoess's testimony did not consist of merely a signed confession; he also wrote two volumes of memoirs before being brought to trial and gave extensive testimony outside of the Nuremberg proceedings. Further, his testimony agrees with that of other contemporary written accounts by Auschwitz officials, such as Pery Broad, an SS man stationed at Auschwitz while Hoess was the commandant and the diary kept by SS physician at Auschwitz Johann Kremer, as well as the testimony of hundreds of camp guards and victims.[http://www.holocaust-history.org/auschwitz/hoess-memoirs/] The result is that Holocaust deniers have needed to construct an elaborate conspiracy theory involving a massive &quot;Jewish plan&quot; to plant forged documents across the continent of Europe, aided by the torture and forced confession of every captured Nazi officer, soldier, and worker who testified at the war crimes tribunal.

Sonderkommandos provide another key piece of testimony.  There were Jewish prisoners who helped march Jews to the gas chambers, and later dragged the bodies to the crematoria.  Since they witnessed the entire process, their testimony is vital in confirming that the gas chambers were used for murderous purposes and the scale to which they were used.

==Body disposal arguments==

===Body Disposal at Auschwitz===

: ''Argument: The facility at Auschwitz II (Birkenau) did not have the means to dispose of the remains of the 1,100,000 alleged victims.''

It is commonly claimed by Holocaust deniers that Auschwitz was incapable of disposing of the corpses of the estimated 1.1 million killed at the camp during its operation, so therefore the bodycount needs to be lowered considerably. This argument seldom stands to scrutiny, and is one of the more frequently disputed assertions made by holocaust deniers.

Robert Faurisson propagated a number of similar arguments, beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many of these arguments would be incorporated by Fred Leuchter, in ''The Leuchter Report''. However, ''The Leuchter Report'' stood to little scrutiny, and Holocaust deniers turned to body disposal arguments and theories.

It is well known by most historians, that the Auschwitz Construction Agency, known as the Bauleitung, began to upgrade its body disposal system as to increase the camp's body disposal capabilities. In the summer of 1942, the Bauleitung started to build four new crematoria in the Birkenau area of the camp, also known as Auschwitz II. These four crematoria housed 46 coke fired ovens. Kremas II and III each had five triple muffle furnaces (15 ovens in each) while Kremas IV and V each had a single eight muffle furnace (eight ovens in each). Like the six ovens in the Auschwitz main camp, the 46 new ovens were built by the firm of Topf and Sons and used coke as fuel. None of these facts are disputed by deniers or their critics. These 46 new ovens, coupled with the 6 original ovens at Auschwitz I (main camp), made for a total of 52 ovens for Auschwitz-Birkenau, plus the burning pits which would later be employed during the camp's operation.
In June of 1943, after the ovens had been in use for several months, a report was prepared by the Bauleitung on the capacity of the crematorium. The report placed the total capacity of all 52 Auschwitz ovens at 4,756 bodies per 24 hour day. 

What is largely disputed by deniers is that the Bauleitung expanded the camp's body disposal capacity as to facilitate the industrial mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians, mainly Jews, and that the total capacity of all furnaces was as great as the Bauleitung suggested in the June 1943 report. Well known &quot;revisionists&quot; Carlo Mattogno and Arthur Butz give figures of around 1,000 bodies per day as the capacity of the Auschwitz furnaces. 

&quot;Revisionists&quot; often theorize that factors other than mass murder account for the expansion of the body disposal facilities. One common theory, first proposed by Carlo Mattogno in 1994, is that typhus epidemics at the camp led to an abnormal death rate among the prisoners, and plans to expand the camps prisoner capacity to 200,000 accounted for the massive upgrades undertaken by the Bauleitung. Although Mattogno and other deniers often argue that a planned expansion of the camp to 200,000 was the main rationale behind the new crematoria, the Bauleitung began negotiating with firms for construction of the four crematoria in July 1942, while the first evidence of the planned expansion, is on August 15. 

Obviously a plan to extend the camp's population to 200,000 would not have called for the construction of 46 additional ovens. During the first planned expansion of the Auschwitz camp in the summer of 1941, which called for 130,000 prisoners, there were only two double muffle furnaces, or four ovens in Auschwitz. The only plan for the installation of ovens coinciding with the camp's expansion, was to order another double muffle furnace in September 1941. This may give a true picture of the real cremation needs of the camp.

In 1944, the Mauthausen-Gusen Concentration Camp in Austria underwent a similar expansion to the one proposed at Auschwitz, which denier Carlo Mattogno cites as being the catalyst behind the Bauleitung's expansion of the cremation facilities. This expansion made at Mauthausen allowed for the prisoner population to expand from 17,000 to 90,000. The only additions made to camp's crematorium deemed necessary by Mauthausen staff to facilitate this influx of prisoners, included the installation of two ovens to the additional one. Similarly in 1944, the Mauthausen-Gusen Complex expanded from two camps to three camps, and no additional ovens where installed.

A brief examination of the evidence would suggest that typhus would not have been a likely catalyst either. Less than 2.9915% of the deaths registered in the Auschwitz death lists between 1941 and 1945 where attributed to typhus. This is likely attributed to the fact that measures where taken on the part of the Auschwitz staff, to quell the epidemic, including massive delousing operations.

It can be inferred by examining the evidence, that neither the typhus epidemic nor the proposed expansion of the camp where likely catalysts for the new crematorium, contrary to deniers claims. It is also most probable given the evidence, that that the Auschwitz staff was infact preparing for the cremation of several hundred thousand corpses at the very least. This is backed up by various documents, including a letter dated October 13, 1942 from the head of the Bauleitung that reads: &quot;As regards the construction of the new crematorium buildings, it was necessary to start immediately in July 1942 because of the situation caused by the special actions.&quot; 

It is argued by deniers that &quot;special actions&quot; referred to anti-typhus operations. This is hardly valid, considering that effective measures against typhus would have been available to Auschwitz staff, which would imply that &quot;special actions&quot; involving the expansion of the crematorium would have hardly been necessary. As demonstrated by the available information, an expansion of the camp's prisoner capacity to 200,000 would hardly require the installation of 46 additional ovens in the name of &quot;special actions.&quot; The expansion of the crematorium would imply that body disposal problems arose. Considering that body disposal problems where attributed to &quot;the situation caused by the special actions,&quot; it can be inferred that &quot;special actions&quot; carried out by Auschwitz staff must have involved mass death on such a scale that it would be necessary to incinerate between 1,000 and 4,756 bodies per 24 hour day, which must imply mass killings.

As I said [[This_quantum_world/Cover|here]], I teach an introductory course of contemporary physics to high-school students (grades 11-12) and undergraduates at the SAICE in Puducherry, India. As I am in the process of preparing my handouts for the next term (starting tomorrow), I thought it might be a good idea to make them more widely available. While our students enjoy an unusual freedom to choose their projects and courses, we teachers are free to offer subjects of our own choosing and are encouraged to explore new methods of teaching. My course is therefore optional and to some extent experimental. (I do understand that there is no such thing as &quot;my Wikibook&quot;, though.) To the bona fide student of physics it offers a perspective that is complementary to those of many excellent textbooks, but this Wikibook aims to be more widely accessible, and it is not meant as a substitute for or to compete with standard texts. Its orientation is more philosophical. While it covers the necessary math and explains its use, the aim is not to impart the technical skills of a physicist. Integration into the Quantum Mechanics book is therefore not advisable; the approaches have different goals and (as I said) are complementary.

Congratulations.
This looks like a promising beginning of a very fine textbook on the topic (at least as far as I can tell from my limited knowldge): all changes are well-motivated, formulae form the back of the reasoning, while not pushing themselves too much in front. Small annotations on history are intermangled with the main text in a sensble way. As a beginner in quantum mechanics, I believe your text is didactically great.
The only point of criticism I want to add here is your introduction of &quot;the two rules&quot;, wich seem to come somewhat &quot;out of the blue&quot;.
All in all, I think this is the (beginning of) a great book, and I'm thinking about translating it to german. Just as an indication how developed your book already is: what topics do you intend to cover?

Thanks for your encouragement! This year I have two batches of very young students, even some bright ones from grade 10, so at present I concentrate on preliminaries, which in this book go into the appendix. I have just added something on probability, and next on the list is the math that we will need. With the college students whom I have taught in the past few years I have covered quite a lot of subjects, up to the basics of relativistic quantum field theory. As for those two rules: they are essentially the fundamental postulates of Feynman's approach — see my  [http://thisquantumworld.com/wordpress/2006/12/19/battered-brains/ blog entry on the subject]. They make it possible to discuss many experimental situations with very little mathematical ado. I have, however, added a clause saying that later we will think about where they come from. In fact, we are going to ''derive'' them. You can get a sneak preview in my paper preposterously entitled [http://in.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0607005 Quantum Mechanics Explained].--[[User:Koantum|Koantum]] 02:45, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== About The Straight Path==
Islam Way of Life or The Straight Path is a set of universal, timeless, complete and fully detailed moral and wisdom values for the benefit of humankind. It is part of a voluntary charter or mutual contract between The Creator and His creation. One should maintain morality and faith on the ultimate justice and in return, he will receive salvation from his Creator. We can easily find this set of values in God's Book by hunting down terms like 'Sacred Prohibitions' or 'My Path, the Straight One'.

If we count from [[s:Quran 6:145 | 6:145]] to [[s:Quran 6:151 | 6:154]], there are 14 sacred prohibitions with 4 food-related and 10 crime-related. The sacred prohibition of usury might have been included implicitly in one of those 14 sacred prohibitions. At the [[s:Quran 6:151 | end of our counts to 14]], God names the 10 sacred prohibitions as The Straight Path and then gives Moses the Scripture saying that it is complete and fully detailed.

It is complete and fully detailed because we will learn on the next chapters that The Straight Path forms the backbone of the entire God's message to humankind. We will see that all rituals were designed specifically to achieve many goals leading to The Straight Path. Also we will find that all law limits was designed specifically to defend The Straight Path from every type of attacks against its values.

=== Further study ===
Please note that this book tries to refer to the Koran in its purest form and free from man-made innovation. But this section is an exception to this book. This section contains sociological study that tries to explain religion-neutral part of Islam at work in various part of the world today. You have been warned.

If you still have doubts on the existance of God, actually you are surrounded by His sign. You just need to be aware of it. There many books about it, such as the one from Harun Yahya series. If you like this book, you may want to read our other book, [[Koranic Law of Nature]].

Nation leaders who rules a multi-ethnic Moslem-majority countries always has some sort of sectarian-neutral moral codes and wisdom. As a rule of thumb, every Islamic leader who refers to [[w:Constitution of Medina | Constitution of Medina]] are the supporter of the Ancient Islam Charter. Likewise, Islamic leaders who publicly denied the relevancy of Constitution of Medina for the 21st century also denied the relevancy of the Ancient Islam Charter. You can learn further from those leaders, such as the one from Jordan and Asian Countries. 

Constitution of Medina is the first religion-neutral charter in history between Believers, Jews, Christian and Others since the Ancient Islam Charter. In fact, Prophet Muhammad use the Ancient Islam Charter as the ideological base for the Medina Charter. You can witness this by the similar usage of term believer in both charters. You will notice as well that the term abider, and both prophethood or messengership of Muhammad are missing on both charters indicating the religion-neutrality of them.

You can learn similar moral codes and wisdom from the forum of inter-faith dialoque and religions-of-the-world studies in the primary school. One of such forum is The International Forum of Islamic Dialoque ([http://www.islam21.net IFID]), where intellectuals such as Dr. Mohammad Shahrour and Dr. Mahathir Mohammad gathers.

After learning from those sources, you will appreciate that the religion-neutral part of Islam is 100% for the benefits of humankind.

=== Inviting Friends ===
Moral and wisdom works like habits and tradition that may take years to master, let alone to teach. The good news is, it is contangible. It means that to be successful you have to teach it by example and persuasion. If you have a very close relationship with the target, your chances are even higher. The younger the target is better. The best time to teach moral and wisdom is as soon as a child start to learn speaking.

While it might takes times, patience and consistency, your job is actually simple. It is simple, because moral and wisdom are religion-neutral and if you feel that something is a good deeds, chances are it is. Therefore, you does not need to be very well versed in a religious doctrine nor need a high level of formal education to teach moral and wisdom.

Even if you failed, you still have hopes. Some of moral codes are related to criminal offence. For example murdering one person equals to murdering the entire humankind. Therefore, you can always bring your community to bring justice to the perpretrator. Just keep in mind that your community should do that within God's Limits. See Chapter 3 for more detail on God's Limits. The worst case scenario is if your community is so badly inflicted in a certain crime. Even then you still have your Creator to protect you from any fears and regrets.

=== Controversies ===
For those who believes that moral code and wisdom is not enough for higher spiritual development, please proceed to Chapter 2. For those who believes that Islam should regulate public policies as well, please proceed to Chapter 3. This chapter only covers the basic and religion-neutral part of Islam. Islam has many faces, therefore this chapter is not trying to re-define Islam nor proofing that a certain definition of Islam is wrong. 

==== The Ancient Islam ====
This book defines Ancient Islam as a period starting by the first human on earth and ended by the dead of the Last Prophet of Islam. In this period, abider a is religion-neutral term, while believer is a religion-specific term. The last prophet tried to established a Civil State with the constitution of Medina.

When the last prophet dies, so does his Civil State. The political system later is replaced by a Caliph State, starting with four elected Caliphes and ended with several Monarch Caliphes. During this period, the term abider and believer blurs to each other into a religion-specific term known as Moslem. We call this period as Modern Islam.

The Post-Modern Islam is the movement to return to the Prophet's example of Civil State and the universality of Islam. This book is written in this mind-set. However, It is not a closed mind-set, but instead an open one. For example, the spiritual aspect of this book tries to embrace as many as possible of the mystical-Islam, known as Sufism. Another example, this book allows Arabian-flavor of Islamic Jurisprudence, such as covering the face of Moslim women as well as Asian-flavor that does not require it. The Arabian-flavor of Islamic Jurisprudence, known as Salafism has place in this Post-Modern Islam.

==== Obsolote Charter ====
A word of caution though, some Moslems believes that this Ancient Islam charter is no longer practical. They argue that Jewish and Christianity teachings are too far corrupted, so the only way to get salvation is to leave Judaism and Christianity and join the Believers. Some of them goes even further by saying that not only this charter is no longer practical, but also abrogated by God. While it is likely that the content of a newer book abrogates an older book, it is highly unlikely that contents of a single book abrogates each others. We call the latter inconsistency.

The following diagram ilustrates the current Islam charter according to some Moslem who rejects the Ancient Islam Charter. We can clearly see that in their charter, the believers can do no wrong and the rest can do no right.
{|
| || Believers || Jewish || Nazarenes || Others
|- bgcolor=green
| Positive || x || || ||
|- bgcolor=red
| Negative || || x || x || x
|}

We can witness that their charter is purely faith based, such as believing in Muhammad or not. While the Ancient Islam Charter is mostly effort based, such as doing good to each others. The Ancient Islam Charter also based on faith but in a religion-neutral way, such as believing in The Creator and the Final Justice and not on any particular human prophet or saint. 

Most of the anti-religious beliefs are still compatible with the Ancient Islam Charter. The exception is the pure [[w:Darwinism | Darwinism]] that totally rejects the existence of The Creator. One example is Agnostic people. They may believe in some kind of Inteligent Design and some kind of Final Justice system. Therefore, we can see that the Ancient Islam Charter is mostly effort-based instead of faith-based.

About impracticality of following Jewish or Christianity teachings, it is up to the reader to decide. For example, accusing God of being disguised as a certain human is an act of rejecters according to the Koran. The Koran also prohibits accusing God of having genetical childrens. 

This explains why in Modern Islam, those who are not &quot;believers&quot; are all treated as &quot;infidels&quot;. This includes the Jewish, Christians and others. But in Ancient Islam, some of those people are considered as a normal law-abiding human being, as long as they trust in God and practice the moral code. In Modern Islam, somebody can be considered &quot;Moslem&quot; by blood, even if he is not practicing his religion. In Ancient Islam, some of these so-called &quot;Moslems&quot; are considered as the rejecters if they pretend as God's partners. Assuming partnership with God is the highest violation possible against the moral code. Lesser violators are considered as either a criminal or a wicked person.

Readers can learn more about theological debate about this subject in Dr. Mohammad Shahrour book, [http://shahrour.org/books.php The Book and Quran]. Unfortunately, Shahrour's books have no English translation. We will not cover this theoretical debate further in this book, as this book will only cover its practical implications.

With these controversies in mind, people who practice Islam Way of Life might try to avoid wasting any time in controversies by choosing their words. For example, instead of mentioning &quot;Moslem&quot;, they will use &quot;believer&quot; term to refer the follower of Muhammad or &quot;law-abider&quot; or &quot;normal human being&quot; to refers to people who honor the Ancient Islam charter. It is also possible to add adjectives to be specific, such as &quot;modern Moslem&quot; to refer to people who are proud of the Modern Islam Civilization but not necessarily the Ancient Islam morals and wisdom. Also instead of mentioning &quot;The Ten Sacred Prohibitions&quot;, they choose to be more specific by mentioning Equality, Family, Humanity, Fairness and Integrity instead. In some cases, they avoid the use of the word &quot;sin&quot;, and mention it as &quot;crime&quot; instead.

==== Charismatic Path ====
Some of Modern Moslem believes that &quot;My Path, a Straight One&quot; in [[s:Quran 6:151 | 6:151-153]] has nothing to do with &quot;The Straight Path&quot; in [[s:Quran 1:1 | 1:6-7]]. They prefer a less direct method.

# They use &quot;God's Favor&quot; [[s:Quran 1:1 | 1:6-7]] in as the ''identifying'' tools for &quot;The Straight Path&quot;, instead of 10 sacred prohibitions in [[s:Quran 6:151 | 6:151-153]].
# They pick a group of people as the only one who receives &quot;God's Favor&quot;. In this case, they choose Muhammad and His Companions, based on one of ''inspirational'' verses. Unfortunately, their opponent choose Muhammad and His Families as the only one who receives &quot;God's Favor&quot; also based on another ''inspirational'' verses.
# They set up a certification hierarchy, where a Modern Moslem cannot be a true Moslem unless he/she learns Islam from a teacher who was certified by his teacher who was also cerfified by his grand-teacher. They believes that this certification process has no broken links from one of Muhammad's companions or families.

We recognize this as an alternative reasoning and has some truth. But, again we consider this as not the whole truth, because even if your grand-grand-grand-grand teacher is Muhammad himself, you are still not allowed to violate any of the moral code mentioned as &quot;My Path, a Straight One&quot; in [[s:Quran 6:151 | 6:151-153]].

==== Priority Shuffle ====
This book put equality, family, humanity, fairness and integrity moral codes in its very first chapter. Other books about Islam includes those 10 sacred prohibitions only in later chapters if they include it at all. Interesting to note that the Koran itself includes &quot;the Straight Path&quot; in its very first page.

While it may not be the intention, it leaves the impression that rituals and beliefs has more priority than protecting humanity and fairness. We can clearly witness this when churches can be burned down after an allegation of Koran or Prophet desacration in a certain Islamic State. We can clearly witness this when a man kill his daughter or sister when he believes that she dishonors the family. In this book, honor or ranks is the second priority after humanity and fairness. 

There are many interpretation of Islam. One interpretation is full of hatred, murderous and totally divorced from humanity, and let alone Islam. The other interpretation is humans and civilized. We put the 10 sacred prohibitions in the first chapter because we believe that they are the backbone of Islam. The beliefs, rituals and law are merely tools and explanation about them.

==== Pork Meat ====
The Old Testament prohibits eating pork meat, so does Koran. Therefore Jews, Moslem and certain Christians prohibits pork meat. One of the favorite explanation about the sacred probitions are three words, &quot;We are brothers&quot;. The DNA of Human, Pig and Monkey are similar to each others differs only 2% percentage. This can be witnessed by the proliferation of retro-virus such as HIV from the monkey and the allegation that &quot;bird-flu&quot; virus use pigs as step-stone into human body. 

In [[s:Quran 5:57 | 5:60]], the Koran does mention an event when God turn some people into pig and monkey as punishment. Whether this verse support the explanation is out of scope of this book. Modern Muslims sometimes turn to genetics to explain divine laws. For example incest is prohibited because of producing genetic defects.

==== Synchretism ====
Some groups do take religion-neutrality too far by setting up a common beliefs and practices. We regards this a synchretism and this book condemn it and does not promote it. This book also condemn and does not promote relativism nor apostasy. Read Chapter 2 for more information.

Another group do try to set up a religion-neutral Law and Jurisprudence. While this book recognizes that God's Law Limits is religion-neutral, but the actual Law and Jurisprudence is not always the case because it differs from region to region based on cultur and history they experienced. Read Chapter 3 for more information.

== About Remembering God ==
Some people in Modern Islam, believes that remembering God is a set of special arabic words that recited over and over. This special words is recited during special time, such as during after the contact-method. It is a valid understanding, but it is not a complete understanding as Remembering God also includes remembering His Commandments such as maintaining the moral codes continuously and not on a specific time.

== About Legal Limits ==
=== Abbrogation ===
Some scholar, however, views law variant in the Koran as abrogation system. They believes that some variant were allowed in the past and it is no longer allowed now. For example is the variant in the punishment of theft. Another example that they believes that in the past, usury was allowed as long as it is not more than double the capital. Variant also applies to alcohol ruling.

This book does not follow this way of thinking. We see variants as variants. We see them as ranges and limits. This will allow different flavors of law to better serve local needs and history or certain conditions.

=== Treaties ===
Islamic Jurisprudence or Islamic Law are collections of legislation and treaties made by the Islamic lawmakers and rulers since the beginning of Modern Islam. The example of treaties are the willingness of certain non-Moslem in certain region to pay regularly certain amount of money in return of security protection from a certain Moslem ruler on a certain period of history.

This special payment is part of treaties of Arabian rulers with other communities. We can easily witness it that none of Asian rulers has such treaties of special payment. Asian rulers does has his own treaties. For example a Malay will lose his ethnicity if he leaves his Islam religion.

=== Other Classification ===
Islamic Jurisprudence has its own levels of good and bad things. 

{|
|- bgcolor=blue
| Prescribed
|- bgcolor=green
| Recommended
|- bgcolor=grey
|Permissible/Allowed
|- bgcolor=orange
| Disliked/Offensive/Detested
|- bgcolor=red
| Unlawful/Prohibited 
|}

In this book, they are actually two different classifications. 
# Closed Classification of Rituals. All religious rituals should be either Prescribed or Recommended, otherwise it will be classified as innovation (bad rituals). It is closed because only small fraction of regulated matters is allowed.
# Open Classification of Public Policies. All day-to-day action are allowed, except the Unlawful or Disliked. It is open because only small fraction of regulated matters is prohibited. The Unlawful roughly equivalent to God's Limit (hudud) and Sacred Prohibition (haram). The Disliked is roughly equivalent to the Unacceptable (munkar). 

Some Modern Moslem believes that moslem can only obey this Jurisprudence under an Islamic Government or Kingdom. In practice, most Moslems do not live under Islamic Government or Kingdom. This Moslem has two choice, try to replace his government with Islamic Goverment or try to live within God's Limits and obey the local legislation. Most Moslems choose the later, including Moslems from the biggest Moslem-majority Country in the world (1/5 of world Moslem population in a single country). But some moslems do choose the first, for example in Iran Revolution where people replace the Secular Monarchy with a Religious Constitutional Government. In fact, in each Moslem country there is always people who wants to replace their government peacefully or forcefully.

This book only concern on how to implement 100% Islam whenever and wherever you are and receives Salvation in return. This book has no interest on Islam Jurisprudence that depends on wherever you successfully topple your government or not. But this book does recommend you to follow commonly accepted Islamic Jurisprudence as much as possible, starting with rituals, civil law and commerce law if possible. The criminal law, political law and international law of the Islamic Jurisprudence only if you are under an Islamic Government or Kingdom. But, don't be so sad, because you still can implements God's Criminal, Political and Milatry Limits on such country.

Even if you can implement every single Islamic Jurisprudence because you are under Islamic Government or Kingdom, this book cannot stressed enough that God's Sacred Prohibitions and God's Limits should have the highest priority over all human legislation including the so-called Islamic Jurisprudence. For example, if honor-killing or instant-divorce is a legal Islamic Jurisprudence in a certain Islamic state, but you believe it violates God's Limits, you still have a choice not to do it.

== Islam is not a new religion. ==
 In fact Islam has been present since man set foot on the earth

Islam is a perfect religion which provides solution to every problem and answer to every question. As the word 'Islam' means 'peace', it is effectively the religion of every human who likes peace. Peace within a human being, peace of mind, peace at home, peace in the society, and peace in the world. In other words Islam is a way of achieving peace by submitting to the Will of God. 

Allah's has given human beings will-power and ability to think and differeciate between wrong and right





i really proud to be a muslim.

I guess you mean redirecting urls of known &quot;bad&quot; sites to 127.0.0.1, as Spybot-S&amp;D does.
I might soon, although it would be one of a hundred hacks that reduce the window of exposure.
Since a lot of details can be found e.g. in the various forums that talk about security, I think I shall try to give the reader some general ideas first.

Mmm... are you tweaking for extra performance or for security?&lt;br&gt;
I don't know much about services... some programs install extra ones (I recognize ZoneAlarm's TrueVector, avast!Antivirus uses 4 services, Matlab, MySQL, Toshiba's ConfigFree...), maybe a tool that recognizes &quot;bad stuff&quot; would be handy; some malware also adds a service but usually it has a glitch that distinguishes it (like gibberish in the &quot;internal name&quot; field); others are dormant waiting for some change in the configuration, so disabling them may mean that later, say, Plug&amp;Play stops working and I don't remember why... ?&lt;br&gt;
Ah - did you see my link to www.sysinternals.com ?

[[User:Tortoise|Tortoise]] 17:32, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

:End of dayish now for me so quick ramble and maybe some more tomorrow.
:Services - tweaked for both - I HATE stuff that installs things without asking!.  The one I gave you the link for allows a &quot;right click search internet for info&quot; approach which I've found v useful.  I know about sysinternals (&amp; Mark's capture by MS) but I didn't find their stuff as friendly.  I'll look around and send you links if you like.  I still say for keeping bad stuff out load the HOSTS file.  You've done some useful constructive editing for which thanks - I think it would be good to work on some of this stuff with someone.  Enough for today I guess (tho I keep a vandal watch for a while!).  Catch you again - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:39, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

== Early bird etc ==

Morning - at work and a bit busy this am but will have some time at lunch and will hopefully be in touch then (vandals permitting! - they are getting a bit irritating at present).

:Hi, not sure if I'll be around then. Got to be on the move today. Anyway, hope you have a good day. [[User:Tortoise|Tortoise]] 08:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== Loosing the plot! ==

Outbreaks of vandalism (&amp; work) over the past couple of days have left me with little &quot;ordinary&quot; editing time (&quot;life&quot; what's that &amp; no I rarely take offence at anything!). Kinda lost where we are up to at present.  Some ramblings follow and I am  not suggesting you '''do''' anything but they may help/interest you?  I would also say if you are not familiar with it [http://www.grc.com Gibson Research] has some very good info/free software as well as ShieldsUp for checking firewalls.

Not aware that there are any issues with not loging out at all by the way.

=== Starter/services ===
The one I sent you is not the sysinternals one but one I think is a little better and allows you to search for items easily.  For Wikibooks I would see two lists as being useful.  FFS &quot;don't touch these services&quot; and &quot;these are usually unecessary for most configs&quot;? For example this page has some useful stuff [http://www.theeldergeek.com/services_guide.htm]

=== Browsers ===
I still see this as a good aspect of security that needs covering.  Not just alternatives to IE but how IE can be made rather more secure - the settings are not a model of clarity for most people? Maybe worth a look at Wikipedia - we can import content from there if it is suitable --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:17, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:Hi, unfortunately I won't be able to contribute regularly since I am really lagging behind with University (I attend Computer Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano, and should have got my degree at the beginning of last year...!). There is no real plot anyway since the book was just a page when I began editing (actually I wonder if the wikibook linked above branched off this one). First attempt at a structure:

*Hardware issues. Preventing data loss (backups)
*basic security [?] (passwords)
*networking, threats to data integrity (viruses, spyware...) - user is passive
*networking, avoiding data theft (phishing) - user's initiative
*tweaking Windows until it hurts
*install Linux :) - the ultimate solution

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Your Book ==

I saw your note in the staff lounge, and i figured I would send you a note directly. I've been involved with a number of other large projects here. [[Human Physiology]] was a college class project that was a resounding success. Also, the [[:Category:APDIP Books]] was a set of books written by the UN that i helped to upload and reformat. 

I would like to personally extend my hand to help you with your project, should you decide to bring it to wikibooks. you can feel free to email me at '''wknight8111 &lt;at&gt; hotmail &lt;dot&gt; com'''. Please include the word &quot;Wikibooks&quot; in the subject so it doesnt accidentally get spam-filtered. Feel free to send me an email or to send me a message on [[User talk:Whiteknight|my user talk page]] if you would like the assistance. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">


The '''Porajmos''' (also '''Porrajmos''') literally ''Devouring'', or '''Samudaripen''' (''Mass killing'') is a term coined by the Roma (Gypsy) people to describe attempts by the Nazi regime to exterminate most of the Roma peoples of Europe during The Holocaust. The phenomenon has been little studied and largely overshadowed by the Shoah (the Hebrew term for the Nazi campaign to exterminate Jews).

Because the Roma communities of Eastern Europe were less organized than the Jewish communities, it is more difficult to assess the actual number of victims, though it is believed to range from 200,000 to 2,000,000.  Only in recent years has the Roma community begun to demand acceptance among the victims of the Nazi regime. The response so far has been mixed.

==Aryan Racial Purity==

In the thousand years that nomadic Roma tribes wandered through Europe, they were subject to persecution and humiliation; they were stigmatized as habitual criminals, social misfits, and vagabonds. Given the Nazi predilection for &quot;racial purity,&quot; it would seem inevitable that the Roma would be among their first victims. Nevertheless, in the earliest days of the Third Reich, the Roma posed a problem for Hitler's racial ideologues. The Gypsy language (Romani) is one of the Indo-Aryan languages, originating in northern India. Nazi anthropologists realized that Roma migrated into Europe from India, and were descendants of the Aryan occupants of the subcontinent, thought at the time to have invaded India from Europe. In other words, the Gypsies were no less Aryan than the Germans themselves. 

Nazi racialist Hans Günther added a socioeconomic component to the theory of racial purity. While he conceded that the Roma were, in fact, descended from Aryans, they were of poorer classes that mingled with the various &quot;inferior&quot; races they encountered during their wanderings. This, he explained, accounted for their extreme poverty and nomadic lifestyle. While he conceded that there were some groups that were &quot;purely Aryan,&quot; most Gypsies posed a threat to Aryan hegemony because of their racial mingling. 

In order to study the problem further, the Nazis established the Racial Hygiene and Demographic Biology Research Unit (''Rassenhygienische und Bevölkerungsbiologische Forschungsstelle'', Department L3 of the Reich Department of Health) in 1936. Headed by Dr. Robert Ritter and his assistant Eva Justin, the body was mandated to conduct an in-depth study of the &quot;Gypsy question&quot; (''Zigeunerfrage'') and to provide data required for formulating a new Reich Gypsy law. After extensive fieldwork in the spring of 1936, consisting of interviews and medical examinations to investigate genealogical and genetic data, it was determined that most Roma posed a danger to German racial purity and should be eliminated. No decision was made regarding the remainder (about 10 percent of the total Roma population of Europe), primarily Sinti and Lalleri tribes living in Germany, though several suggestions were made. At one point Heinrich Himmler even suggested the establishment of a remote reservation, where the &quot;pure Gypsies&quot; could continue their nomadic lifestyle unhindered. According to him: 

:''&quot;...The aim of measures taken by the State to defend the homogeneity of the German nation must be the physical separation of Gypsydom from the German nation, the prevention of miscegenation, and finally, the regulation of the way of life of pure and part-Gypsies.&quot;''

==Loss of Citizenship==
On January 3, 1936, the Nuremberg laws, prohibiting marriages between Jews and Aryans, was extended to Gypsies as well. Gypsies, like Jews, lost their right to vote on March 7, 1936.

== Extermination ==
The vast majority of Roma were to suffer the same indignities as the Jews, and in some instances, they suffered even more brutally. According to Porajmos historian Ian Hancock, proportionately, the Roma death toll equaled &quot;and almost certainly exceed[ed], that of Jewish victims.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.chgs.umn.edu/Histories__Narratives__Documen/Roma___Sinti__Gypsies_/Jewish_Responses_to_the_Porraj/jewish_responses_to_the_porraj.html Jewish Responses to the Porrajmos (The Romani Holocaust)],&quot; Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, University of Minnesota (accessed June 24, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; They were herded into ghettos, including the Warsaw Ghetto (April–June, 1942), where they formed a distinct subclass. According to Ghetto diarist Emmanuel Ringelblum, the Gypsies were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto because the Germans wanted 

:''&quot;..To toss into the Ghetto everything that is characteristically dirty, shabby, bizarre, of which one ought to be frightened, and which anyway has to be destroyed.&quot;'' 

Further east, teams of Einsatzgruppen tracked down Roma encampments and murdered the inhabitants on the spot, leaving no records of the victims. 

Gypsies were also victims of the puppet regimes that cooperated with the Third Reich during the war, especially the notorious Ustashe regime in Croatia. In Jasenovac concentration camp, along with Serbs and Jews, tens of thousands of Gypsies were killed. 

On December 16, 1942, Himmler ordered that the Roma candidates for extermination should be deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. To the Roma people of Europe, this order was equivalent to the January 20 decision of that same year, made at the Wannsee Conference, at which Nazi bureaucrats decided on the &quot;Final Solution&quot; of the &quot;Jewish problem&quot;. Himmler then on November 15, 1943 ordered that Gypsies and &quot;part-Gypsies&quot; were to be put &quot;on the same level as Jews and placed in concentration camps.&quot; 

According to testimonies of Jewish and Nazi witnesses, Gypsies sent to the death camps often suffered even worse than Jews. In some instances, the Nazis were so appalled by the sight of Roma arriving in the transports that they would not even let them in the gates of the camps for selection and simply murdered them by the railway platforms. In one remarkable instance, the victims were so terrified that they would be killed on the spot that they actually stormed the gates of the death camp, demanding to be allowed in—they were promptly led to the gas chambers, all the while believing that they would find sanctuary there.

The governments of Nazi German allies, such as Hungary and Romania, also contributed to the Nazi plan of Roma extermination, but this was implemented on a smaller scale and most Hungarian and Romanian Roma people survived. The Hungarian government sent to Auschwitz between 30,000 and 70,000 Roma people while the Croatian government sent 26,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Jasenovac.html Jasenovac], at the Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;; of the Roma killed, about half were at the Jasenovac concentration camp. Similarly, the Romanian government of Ion Antonescu had its own concentration camps in Transnistria where 25,000 Roma people were deported, from which 11,000 died&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/about_yad/what_new/data_whats_new/pdf/english/Findings_Recommendations.pdf  The report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania] (PDF), from Yad Vashem&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Roma internees were sent to the Lety and Hodonín camps before being transferred to Auschwitz-Birkenau for gassing. What makes the Lety camp unique is that it was staffed by Czech guards, who could be even more brutal than the Germans, as testified in Paul Polansky's book ''Black Silence''.

Nazi eugenics pertains to Nazi Germany's nazism and race social policies that placed the improvement of the race through eugenics at the centre of their concerns and targeted those humans they identified as Life Unworthy of Life, including but not limited to: criminal, degenerate, dissident, feeble-minded, homosexual, idle, insane, religious and weak humans for elimination from the chain of heredity.

==Hitler and eugenics==
Hitler had read some racial-hygiene tracts during his period of imprisonment in Landsberg prison.  The future leader considered that Germany could only become strong again if the state applied to German society the basic principles of racial hygiene and genetic engineering.

Hitler believed the nation had become weak, corrupted by the infusion of degenerate elements (similar to genes) into its bloodstream.  These had to be removed as quickly as possible.  The strong and the racially pure had to be encouraged to have more children, and the weak and the racially impure had to be neutralized by one means or another. Ironically, it has also been speculated Hitler had Parkinson's disease.

==Sterilization law==

The Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring, proclaimed on July 14, 1933 required physicians to register every case of hereditary illness known to them, except in women over forty-five years of age. Physicians could be fined for failing to comply.  In 1934 the first year of the Law's operation, nearly 4,000 people appealed against the decisions of sterilisation authorities, 3,559 of the appeals failed. By the end of the Nazi regime, over 200 &quot;Genetic Health Courts&quot; were created, and under their rulings over 400,000 people were sterilized against their will.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Proctor, ''Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1988): 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sterilization to murder==

Action T4 (German '''Aktion T4''') was the official name of the Nazi Germany eugenics program which forcefully conducted euthanasia on Germans who were institutionalized or suffering from birth defects. In total, an estimated 200,000 people were killed as a result of the program.

==Hadamar Clinic==

The Hadamar Clinic was a mental hospital in the German town of Hadamar, which was used by the Nazis as the site of their T-4 Euthanasia Program.

==Kaiser Wilhem Institute==

The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics was founded in 1927. In its early years, and during the Nazi era, it was strongly associated with theories of eugenics and racial hygiene advocated by its leading theorists Fritz Lenz and Eugen Fischer, and by its director Otmar von Verschuer. Under Fischer, the sterilisation of so-called Rhineland Bastards was undertaken.

==Applying racial hygiene==
Applying the principles of racial hygiene to society meant sweeping away traditional morality and replacing it with a system of ethics that derived good and bad solely from the imagined collective interests of the master race.

==International views==

Some physicians outside Germany also held the view that many social ills were the result of the hereditary degeneracy of certain sections of the population. Even before the Nazis came to power in Germany twenty-eight states in the United States had passed compulsory sterilisation laws resulting in the sterilization of 15,999 people; the total had more than doubled by 1939. &lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/1796.html The Horrifying American Roots of Nazi Eugenics]&lt;/ref&gt; Over 60,000 people had been sterilized under U.S. compulsory sterilization laws before they became mostly unused in the 1960s. Many people were sterilized as children and did not know what had been done until they tried to conceive as adults. 

Years and decades after the large-scale forced sterilization programs had ceased to exist in the US, many countries maintained post WWII sterilization campaigns lasting well into the 1970s.

In 1997 it was disclosed that Sweden in particular had a strong sterilization program, sterilizing around 62,000 individuals over a period of 40 years until 1976.
In the United Kingdom, Home Secretary Winston Churchill introduced a bill that became the 1913 Mental Deficiency Act, which initially included a clause allowing forced sterilization of the mentally ill. Writer G.K. Chesterton led a successful effort to defeat that clause of the bill. 

In 1990s Peru, the government of former president Alberto Fujimori was accused of having pressured 200,000 indigenous people in rural areas, mainly Quechuas and Aymaras, into being sterilized as part of a family planning policy.&lt;ref&gt; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2148793.stm Mass sterilisation scandal shocks Peru]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet Union imposed forced sterilization for female workers deported from Romania to Soviet labour camps, which occurred after World War II, when Romania was supposed to supply reconstruction workforce, according to the armistice convention. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jurnalul.ro/articol_44654/comunism___dora_dumitru__sterilizata_in_deportarea_din_urss.html A link to the testimony of such a deportee]&lt;/ref&gt;  India and China have at various times implemented sterilisation campaigns as a population control policy, although only the latter has made any previous overtures towards any potential eugenic motivations.

Other countries that had notably active sterilization programs include Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Panama, Slovakia and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Broberg, G. (2005). ''Eugenics And the Welfare State: Sterilization Policy in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland''. Michigan State University Press. ISBN 0-87013-758-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church has been a notable opponent of eugenics and sterilization programs since long before the creation of the Nazi state for religious reasons.

After revelations of the Holocaust and the connection between Nazi master race ideology and eugenics became well known, public support for eugenics became muted in the postwar years and eventually became non-existent, as eugenics became inextricably associated with the Nazi regime.

      <comment>/* The rise of Nazism */ ce</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Gay men and, to a lesser extent, lesbians, were two of several groups targeted by Nazis during the Holocaust.

==The rise of Nazism==

Prior to the Third Reich, Berlin was considered a liberal city, with many gay bars, nightclubs and cabarets. There were even many drag bars where tourists, heterosexuals and gays would enjoy female impersonation acts. Adolf Hitler decried cultural degeneration, prostitution and syphilis in his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; blaming at least some of the phenomena on Jews.

Berlin also had the most active LGBT rights movements in the world at the time. Jewish doctor Magnus Hirschfeld had co-founded the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee (Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee, WhK) in Berlin in 1897 to campaign against the notorious &quot;Paragraph 175&quot; law that made sex between men illegal. It also sought social recognition of homosexual and transgender men and women. It was the first public gay rights organization. 

In 1919, Hirschfeld had also co-founded the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sex Research), a private sexology research institute. It had a research library and a large archive, and included a marriage and sex counseling office. In addition, the institute was a pioneer worldwide in the call for civil rights and social acceptance for homosexual and transgender people.

The advancements of the gay community were soon erased, however, with the coming to power of Hitler's Nazi Party. 

Nazism declared itself incompatible with homosexuality, because gays did not reproduce and perpetuate the master race. For the same reasons, masturbation was also considered harmful to the Reich, but treated lightly. There was also a fear among Nazis of a &quot;gay gene&quot; contamination. 

Hitler believed that homosexuality was &quot;degenerate behavior&quot; which posed a threat to the capacity of the state and the &quot;masculine character&quot; of the nation. Gay men were denounced as &quot;enemies of the state&quot; and charged with &quot;corrupting&quot; public morality and posing a threat to the German birthrate.

Nazi leaders such as Himmler also viewed homosexuals as a separate people and had Nazi doctors experiment on them in an effort to locate the hereditary weakness many party members believed caused homosexuality.

Some leaders clearly wanted gay people exterminated, while others wanted enforcement of laws banning sex between gay men or lesbians. 

Ernst Röhm, a man Hitler perceived as a potential threat, and the leader of Sturmabteilung, the Nazi Party's first militia, was discreetly gay until 1925 when he was outed by a Social Democratic newspaper that published a number of love letters written by Röhm, as were some other top leaders of the SA, such as Edmund Heines. After 1925, Röhm was quite open about his sexuality and was a member of the League for Human Rights, Germany's largest gay rights group.

German Jews played a prominent role in the gay rights movement in Germany. The German-Jewish arts and film community had a large concentration of homosexuals.  

German Jews like Magnus Hirschfeld were heavily criticized. They were demonized for their controversial ideas which were shocking to many people in Europe.  Even though Sigmund Freud had nothing to do with the gay rights movement in Germany (since he was an Austrian Jew), he was targeted because he was Jewish and had controversial ideas about sexuality. Anyone who promoted controversial sexual ideas was thought of as a deviant by German society and especially by the Nazis. Freud was particularly criticized for some incestuous concepts like Oedipus Complex and the Electra Complex in which he claimed were psychodevelopmental phenomena where children developed sexual feelings toward the opposite sex parent.

==Purge of Homosexuals==
[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|right|240px|thumb|On May 10, 1933, Nazis in Berlin burned works of Jewish authors, the library of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, and other works considered &quot;un-German&quot;.]]

In late February 1933, as the moderating influence of Ernst Röhm weakened, the Nazi Party launched its purge of homosexual (gay, lesbian, and bisexual; then known as homophile) clubs in Berlin, outlawed sex publications, and banned organized gay groups. As a consequence, many fled Germany (e.g. Erika Mann, Richard Plaut). In March 1933, Kurt Hiller, the main organizer of Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute of Sex Research, was sent to a concentration camp.

On May 6, 1933, Nazi Youth of the Deutsche Studentenschaft made an organised attack on the Institute of Sex Research.  A few days later the Institute's library and archives were publicly hauled out and burned in the streets of the Opernplatz. Around 20,000 books and journals, and 5,000 images, were destroyed. Also seized were the Institute's extensive lists of names and addresses of LGBT people. In the midst of the burning, Joseph Goebbels gave a political speech to a crowd of around 40,000 people. 

Hitler initially protected Röhm from other elements of the Nazi Party which held his homosexuality to be a violation of the party's strong anti-gay policy. However, Hitler later changed course when he perceived Röhm to be a potential threat to his power. During the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, a purge of those who Hitler deemed threats to his power took place. He had Röhm murdered and used Röhm's homosexuality as a justification to subside outrage within the ranks of the SA. After solidifying his power, Hitler would include gay men among those sent to concentration camps during the Holocaust. Many of these gay men were also Jewish and this is a major reason that they were so heavily targeted by the Nazis.

Himmler had initially been a supporter of Röhm, arguing that the charges of homosexuality against him were manufactured by Jews. But after the purge, Hitler elevated Himmler's status and he became very active in the suppression of homosexuality. He exclaimed, &quot;We must exterminate these people root and branch... the homosexual must be eliminated.&quot; (Plant, 1986, p. 99).

Shortly after the purge in 1934, a special division of the Gestapo was instituted to compile lists of gay individuals. In 1936, Heinrich Himmler, Chief of the Schutzstaffel, created the &quot;Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion.&quot;

Gays were not initially treated in the same fashion as the Jews, however; Nazi Germany thought of German gay men as part of the &quot;Master Race&quot; and sought to force gay men into sexual and social conformity. Gay men who would or could not conform and feign a switch in sexual orientation were sent to concentration camps under the &quot;Extermination Through Work&quot; campaign.

More than one million gay German men were targeted, of whom at least 100,000 were arrested and 50,000 were serving prison terms as convicted gay men.&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum[[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/hsx/]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of European gay men living under Nazi occupation were castrated under court order.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, Geoffrey J. &quot;'The Most Unkindest Cut of All': Castration, Homosexuality and Nazi Justice,&quot; Journal of Contemporary History, vol. 27 (1992): pp. 41-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some persecuted under these laws would not have identified themselves as gay. Such &quot;anti-homosexual&quot; laws were widespread throughout the western world until the 1960s and 1970s, so many gay men did not feel safe to come forward with their stories until the 1970s when many so-called &quot;sodomy laws&quot; were repealed.

Lesbians were not widely persecuted under Nazi anti-gay laws, as it was considered easier to persuade or force them to comply with accepted heterosexual behavior. However, they were viewed as a threat to state values and were often branded &quot;anti-social.&quot;

==Concentration Camps==
Estimates vary wildly as to the number of gay men killed in concentration camps during the Holocaust ranging from 15,000 to 600,000. The deaths of at least an estimated 15,000 gay men in concentration camps were officially documented. Larger numbers include those who were Jewish and gay, or even Jewish, gay and communist. In addition, records as to the specific reasons for internment are non-existent in many areas, making it hard to put an exact number on just how many gay men perished in death camps.

Gay men suffered unusually cruel treatment in the concentration camps. They faced persecution not only from German soldiers but also from other prisoners, and many gay men were beaten to death. Additionally, gay men in forced labor camps routinely received more grueling and dangerous work assignments than other non-Jewish inmates, under the policy of &quot;Extermination Through Work&quot;. German soldiers also were known to use gay men for target practice, aiming their weapons at the pink triangles their human targets were forced to wear.

The harsh treatment can be attributed to the view of the SS guards toward gay men, as well as to the homophobic attitudes present in German society at large. The marginalization of gay men in Germany was reflected in the camps. Many died from unsympathetic beatings, some of them caused by other prisoners. And Nazi doctors often used gay men for scientific experiments in an attempt to locate a &quot;gay gene&quot; to &quot;cure&quot; any future Aryan children who were gay.

An account of a gay Holocaust survivor, Pierre Seel, details life for gay men during Nazi control. In his account he states that he participated in his local gay community in the town of Mulhouse. When the Nazis gained power over the town his name was on a list of local gay men ordered to the police station. He obeyed the directive to protect his family from any retaliation. Upon arriving at the police station he notes that he and other gay men were beaten. Some gay men who resisted the SS had their fingernails pulled out. Others were raped with broken rulers and had their bowels punctured, causing them to bleed profusely. After his arrest he was sent to the concentration camp at Schirmeck. There, Seel stated that during a morning roll-call, the Nazi commander announced a public execution. A man was brought out, and Seel recognized his face. It was the face of his eighteen-year-old lover from Mulhouse. Seel then claims that the Nazi guards stripped the clothes of his lover and placed a metal bucket over his head. Then the guards released trained German Shepherd dogs on him, which mauled him to death.

Experiences such as these can account for the relatively high death rate of gay men in the camps as compared to the other &quot;anti-social groups.&quot; A study by Ruediger Lautmann found that 60 percent of gay men in concentration camps died, as compared to 41 percent for political prisoners and 35 percent for Jehovah's Witnesses. The study also shows that survival rates for gay men were slightly higher for internees from the middle and upper classes and for married bisexual men and those with children.

==Post-War==
[[Image:ac.homomonument.jpg|thumb|225px|left|One point of the Homomonument, in Amsterdam, to gay and lesbian victims of persecution, which is formed of three large pink triangles made of granite.]]

After the war, homosexual concentration camp prisoners were not acknowledged as victims of Nazi persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Burleigh, Michael and Wolfgang Wipperman. ''The Racial State: Germany, 1933-1945.'' New York: Cambridge, 1991. p.183&lt;/ref&gt; Reparations and state pensions available to other groups were refused to gay men, who were still classified as criminals — the Nazi anti-gay law was not repealed until 1969. They could be re-imprisoned for &quot;repeat offenses,&quot; and were kept on the modern lists of &quot;sex offenders.&quot; Under the Allied Military Government of Germany, some homosexuals were forced to serve out their terms of imprisonment, regardless of the time spent in concentration camps. 

Since the 1980s, some cities around the world have erected memorials to remember the thousands of gay people who were murdered and persecuted during the Holocaust. Major memorials can be found in Berlin, Germany; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Montevideo, Uruguay; and San Francisco, United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andrejkoymasky.com/mem/holocaust/ho08.html Memorials of the Gay Holocaust], Matt &amp; Andrej Koymasky&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the German government released an official apology to the gay community.

In 2005, the European Parliament marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz camp with a minute's silence and the passage of a resolution. In its early draft, this resolution included the following text:&lt;br&gt;
''&quot;The death camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where hundreds of thousands of Jews, Roma, homosexuals, Poles and other prisoners of various nationalities were murdered, is not only a major occasion for European citizens to remember and condemn the enormous horror and tragedy of the Holocaust, but also for addressing the disturbing rise in anti-Semitism, and especially anti-Semitic incidents, in Europe, and for learning anew the wider lessons about the dangers of victimizing people on the basis of race, ethnic origin, religion, politics, or sexual orientation.&quot;'' However, in the final version of this resolution, the reference to homosexuals was removed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe after today's changes this book should be the only balancing reactions book. I've adopted a few things from the other book. My next plan is to add a section on redox reactions. Anything else we need? Maybe nuclear reactions?

:Technically, there is only one [[General Chemistry]] book, but it happens to have two chapters titled &quot;Balancing equations&quot;. We can (and should) merge them together. I don't have time today, but you are more then welcome to try it. If you can't merge the pages together on your own, send me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]], and I will take care of it when I get back on sunday night. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:29, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

White has refused to take the risk to push his pawn forward. Instead, he chose to defend it. This choice can be seen as &quot;evasive&quot;. Black might think that White is trying to avoid [[Chess/Alekhine's Defence|Alekhine's Defence]]. He may accept to transpose into [[Chess/Vienna Game|Vienna Game]] with [[Opening_theory_in_chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Nc3/2...Nf6|2...e5]] or he may continue in a sharper line with [[/2...d5/]].

= Petrovs Defence : Cochrane Gambit =
Blacks priority is to organize his defence and to counter Whites attack. Therefore, [[/5...Nxe4/]] is bad (moreover, White can win the knight with 6. Qh5+ g6 7. Qd5+).

There are three strategies to build comfortably the defence :
:[[/5...c5/]] tries to regain space by attacking the center from the queen side.
:[[/5...Be7/]] is a first step toward an &quot;artificial castling&quot;. This prepares Re8 and Kg8.
:[[/5...g6/]] prepares a fianchetto. Black will leave the e file open and builds another kind of defence with the bishop on g7. But we may wonder if this will resist a White pawn advance on the king side.

:The Black fortress is solid. White should not wait before attacking it, because Black can play 3...f5 if White plays a passive move, which would definitely equalize.

:The best move is probably [[/3. d4/]]. White threatens a queen exchange with dxe5 dxe5 Qxd8+ Kxd8 and Black can forget about castling. It puts pressure on the center and the Black fortress may collapse at any time.

:Another possibility is [[/3. Bc4/]] leading to a more positional game, playable for both camps.

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

Black has now to deal with the dxe5 threat, but he has to be very careful as there are many traps here!

:[[/3...Bg4/]] is not a good idea. After 4. dxe5 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 dxe5 6. Bc4, White has a strong initiative.
:[[/3...exd4/]] is strange as Black gives up the center he tried to strengthen, but remains playable.
:[[/3...Nc6/]] leaves Black in a little trouble after 4. Bb5. 
:[[/3...Nd7/]], the Hanham Variation, is a path filled with traps after 4. Bc4, but may be playable if Black is careful enough.

Better variations include:

:[[/3...f5/]], the Philidor counter-Gambit which is quite risky but may lead to victory.
:[[/3...Nf6/]], the improved Hanham Variation is the main line.

Another option would be:
:[[/3...f6/]], countering Queen exchange and gaining center if dxe5

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{General Mechanics}}

The kinetic energy and angular momentum of the dumbbell may be split into two parts, one having to do with the motion of the center of mass of the dumbbell, the other having to do with the motion of the dumbbell relative to its center of mass.

To do this we first split the position vectors into two parts. The centre of mass is at.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=\frac{M_1 \mathbf{r}_1 + M_2 \mathbf{r}_2}{M_1+M_2}&lt;/math&gt;

so we can define new position vectors, giving the position of the masses relative to the centre of mass, as shown.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^*_1=\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{R}_1 \quad 
\mathbf{r}^*_1=\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{R}_1&lt;/math&gt;

The total kinetic energy is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}K &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}M_1 V_1^2  &amp;+ &amp; \frac{1}{2}M_2 V_2^2 \\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac{1}{2}M_1 |\mathbf{V}-\mathbf{v}^*_1|^2  &amp;+ &amp; \frac{1}{2}M_2 |\mathbf{V}-\mathbf{v}^*_2|^2\\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}(M_1+M_2)V^2 &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{2}M_1 {v^*_1}^2 + \frac{1}{2}M_2 {v^*_2}^2 \\ 
&amp; = &amp; K_{ext} &amp; + &amp; K_{int}\\
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

which is the sum of the kinetic energy the dumbbell would have if both masses were concentrated at the center of mass, the ''translational kinetic energy'' and the kinetic energy it would have if it were observed from a reference frame in which the center of mass is stationary, the ''rotational kinetic energy''.

The total angular momentum can be similarly split up
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{L} &amp; = &amp; \mathbf{L}_{orb} &amp; + &amp; \mathbf{L}_{spin}\\
&amp; = &amp; (M_1+M_2)\mathbf{R}\times \mathbf{V} &amp; + &amp; (M_1\mathbf{r}^*_1 \times \mathbf{v}^*_1 + M_2\mathbf{r}^*_2 \times \mathbf{v}^*_2)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

into the sum of the angular momentum the system would have if all the mass were concentrated at the center of mass, the ''orbital angular momentum'', and the angular momentum of motion about the center of mass, the ''spin angular momentum''.

We can therefore assume the centre of mass to be fixed.

Since '''&amp;omega;''' is enough to describe the dumbbells motion, it should be enough to determine the angular momentum and internal kinetic energy. We will try writing both of these in terms of ''&amp;omega;''
 
First we use two results from earlier
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v} \quad \mbox{and} \quad \mathbf{v}=\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt;
to write the angular momentum in terms of the angular velocity


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\mathbf{L} &amp; = &amp; M_1\mathbf{r}^*_1 \times \mathbf{v}^*_1 &amp; + &amp; M_2\mathbf{r}^*_2 \times \mathbf{v}^*_2\\
&amp; = &amp; M_1\mathbf{r}^*_1 \times (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}^*_1) &amp; + &amp; M_2\mathbf{r}^*_2 \times (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}^*_2)\\
 &amp; = &amp; 
M_1 \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} \left( \mathbf{r}^*_1 \cdot \mathbf{r}^*_1\right) - \mathbf{r}^*_1 \left( \mathbf{r}^*_1 \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega} \right)\right) &amp; + &amp; 
M_2 \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} \left( \mathbf{r}^*_2 \cdot \mathbf{r}^*_2\right) - \mathbf{r}^*_2 \left( \mathbf{r}^*_2 \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}\right) \right)\\
&amp; = &amp; M_1 \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} d_1^2 - 
\mathbf{r}^*_1 \left( \mathbf{r}^*_1 \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega} \right)\right) 
&amp; + &amp; M_2 \left( \boldsymbol{\omega} d_2^2 - 
\mathbf{r}^*_2 \left( \mathbf{r}^*_2 \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}\right) \right) \\
&amp; = &amp; (M_1d_1^2+M_2d_2^2) \boldsymbol{\omega} &amp; - &amp; 
\left (M_1 \mathbf{r}^*_1\left( \mathbf{r}^*_1\cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}\right)
+ M_2 \mathbf{r}^*_2\left( \mathbf{r}^*_2\cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}\right) \right) \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term in the angular momentum is proportional to the angular velocity, as might be expected, but the second term is not.

What this means becomes clearer if we look at the components of '''L'''
For notational convenience we'll write
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^*_1 = (x_1, y_1, z_1) \quad \mathbf{r}^*_2 = (x_2, y_2, z_2) 
&lt;/math&gt;

These six numbers are constants, reflecting the geometry of the dumbbell.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
L_x &amp; = &amp; (M_1d_1^2+M_2d_2^2)\omega_x  - (M_1 x_1^2+M_2 x_2^2)\omega_x \\
&amp;  &amp;  -(M_1 x_1 y_1+M_2 x_2 y_2)\omega_y -  (M_1 x_1 z_1+M_2 x_2 z_2)\omega_z \\
L_y &amp; = &amp; (M_1d_1^2+M_2d_2^2)\omega_y  -  (M_1 x_1^2+M_2 x_2^2)\omega_y \\
&amp; &amp;  -(M_1 x_1 y_1+M_2 x_2 y_2)\omega_x -  (M_1 y_1 z_1+M_2 y_2 z_2)\omega_z \\
L_z &amp; = &amp; (M_1d_1^2+M_2d_2^2)\omega_z  -(M_1 x_1^2+M_2 x_2^2)\omega_z \\
&amp; &amp; -(M_1 x_1 z_1+M_2 x_2 z_2)\omega_x - (M_1 y_1 z_1+M_2 y_2 z_2)\omega_y \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This, we recognise as being a matrix multiplication.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} L_x \\ L_y \\ L_z \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} I_{xx} &amp; I_{xy} &amp; I_{xz} \\ I_{yx} &amp; I_{yy} &amp; I_{yz} \\
I_{zx} &amp; I_{zy} &amp; I_{zz} \end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix} \omega_x \\ \omega_y \\ \omega_z \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} I_{xx} &amp; I_{xy} &amp; I_{xz} \\ I_{yx} &amp; I_{yy} &amp; I_{yz} \\
I_{zx} &amp; I_{zy} &amp; I_{zz} \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
M_1(d_1^2-x_1^2)+M_2(d_2^2-x_2^2) &amp; -(M_1 x_1 y_1 + M_2 x_2 y_2) 
&amp; -(M_1 x_1 z_1+M_2 x_2 z_2) \\
-(M_1 x_1 y_1 + M_2 x_2 y_2) &amp; M_1(d_1^2-y_1^2)+M_2(d_2^2-y_2^2)
&amp; -(M_1 y_1 z_1+M_2 y_2 z_2) \\
-(M_1 x_1 z_1 + M_2 x_2 z_2) &amp; -(M_1 y_1 z_1+M_2 y_2 z_2) &amp; M_1(d_1^2-z_1^2)+M_2(d_2^2-z_2^2) \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The nine coefficients of the  matrix '''I''' are called ''moments of inertia''.

By choosing our axis carefully we can make this matrix diagonal. E.g. if 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}^*_1 = (d_1, 0, 0) \quad \mathbf{r}^*_2 = (-d_2, 0, 0) &lt;/math&gt;

then
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} I_{xx} &amp; I_{xy} &amp; I_{xz} \\ I_{yx} &amp; I_{yy} &amp; I_{yz} \\
I_{zx} &amp; I_{zy} &amp; I_{zz} \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; M_1 d_1^2 +M_2 d_2^2 &amp; 0 \\  
0 &amp; 0 &amp; M_1 d_1^2 +M_2 d_2^2 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Because the dumbbell is aligned along the ''x''-axis, rotating it around that axis has no effect.

The relationship between the kinetic energy, ''T'', and &amp;omega; quickly follows.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
2T &amp; = &amp;  M_1 {v^*_1}^2 &amp; + &amp;  M_2 {v^*_2}^2\\
&amp; = &amp; M_1 \mathbf{v}^*_1 \cdot (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}^*_1) &amp; + &amp;
M_1 \mathbf{v}^*_2 \cdot (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}^*_2) \\
&amp; = &amp; M_1 \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot (\mathbf{r}^*_1 \times \mathbf{v}^*_1) &amp; + &amp;
M_2 \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot (\mathbf{r}^*_2 \times \mathbf{v}^*_2)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

On the right hand side we immediately recognise the definition of angular momentum.

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\omega} \cdot \mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for '''L''' gives

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} \boldsymbol{\omega}\mathbf{I}\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega} = \omega \mathbf{n} \quad 
\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{n}=1 &lt;/math&gt;

this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} I  \omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''moment of inertia around the axis '''n''' is '' 

:&lt;math&gt;I=\mathbf{n} \mathbf{I} \mathbf{n} &lt;/math&gt;

a constant.

If the dumbbell is aligned along the ''x''-axis as before we get
:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{1}{2} (M_1 d_1^2 +M_2 d_2^2) (\omega_y^2+\omega_z^2)&lt;/math&gt;

These equations of rotational dynamics are similar to those for linear dynamics, except that '''I''' is a matrix rather than a scalar.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[:w:Hash table|Hash Tables]] are a powerful data structure, associating keys with values in a very efficient way. Hash Tables are often preferred over association lists whenever performance is an issue, but they introduce a little overhead that makes assoc lists better if there are only a few key-value pairs to maintain.

== Creating a Hash Table ==

Hash Tables are created using the function MAKE-HASH-TABLE. It has no required argument. Its most used optional keyword argument is :TEST, specifying the function used to test the equality of keys.

== Getting a value from a Hash Table ==

The function GETHASH takes two required arguments: a key and a hash table. It returns two values: the value corresponding to the key in the hash table (or NIL if not found), and a boolean indicating whether the key was found in the table. That second value is necessary since NIL is a valid value in a key-value pair, so getting NIL as first value from GETHASH does not necessarily mean that the key was not found in the table.

== Adding an Element to a Hash Table ==

If you want to add an element to a hash table, you can use GETHASH, the function to retrieve elements from the hash table, in conjunction with SETF.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (setf (gethash 'one-entry *my-hash*) &quot;one&quot;)
&quot;one&quot;
* (setf (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*) 2/4)
1/2
* (gethash 'one-entry *my-hash*)
&quot;one&quot;
T
* (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*)
1/2
T
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Testing for the Presence of a Key in a Hash Table ==

The first value returned by GETHASH is the object in the hash table that's associated with the key you provided as an argument to GETHASH or NIL if no value exists for this key. This value can act as a generalized boolean if you want to test for the presence of keys.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (setf (gethash 'one-entry *my-hash*) &quot;one&quot;)
&quot;one&quot;
* (if (gethash 'one-entry *my-hash*)
    &quot;Key exists&quot;
    &quot;Key does not exist&quot;)
&quot;Key exists&quot;
* (if (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*)
    &quot;Key exists&quot;
    &quot;Key does not exist&quot;)
&quot;Key does not exist&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

But note that this does not work if NIL is amongst the values that you want to store in the hash.

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; continued from above
* (setf (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*) nil)
NIL
* (if (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*)
    &quot;Key exists&quot;
    &quot;Key does not exist&quot;)
&quot;Key does not exist&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this case you'll have to check the second return value of GETHASH which will always return NIL if no value is found and T otherwise.

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; continued from above
* (if (nth-value 1 (gethash 'another-entry *my-hash*))
    &quot;Key exists&quot;
    &quot;Key does not exist&quot;)
&quot;Key exists&quot;
* (if (nth-value 1 (gethash 'no-entry *my-hash*))
    &quot;Key exists&quot;
    &quot;Key does not exist&quot;)
&quot;Key does not exist&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Default values and GETHASH ==

GETHASH can take an optional third argument, which is a ''default value'' to be returned instead of NIL if the key isn't found. 

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; continused from above
* (let ((default (cons nil nil)))
     (if (eq (gethash 'no-entry *my-hash* default) default)
         &quot;Key does not exist&quot;
         &quot;Key exists&quot;))
&quot;Key does not exist&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This can be used in place of the extra return value in some cases (such as if you're using MAPCAR over a sequence of keys) where using the extra value might be cumbersome; you can ensure the default value is unique  by using a fresh cons cell. For example, you could use this to easily get the values associated with keys in a list, removing the keys that aren't found.

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun get-hash-keys (keys table)
  (let ((missing (cons nil nil)))
    ;; MAPCAR returns a fresh list, so you can safely use DELETE here.
    (delete missing (mapcar (lambda (key) (gethash key table missing)) keys))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, this feature really shines when used alongside SETF-based macros like INCF. You can use this feature to populate a hash table with the counts of how often different elements appear in a sequence.

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun tally-table (list) 
  (let ((table (make-hash-table)))
    (dolist (elt list)
       (incf (gethash elt table 0)))
       table))
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Deleting from a Hash Table ==

Use REMHASH to delete a hash entry. Both the key and its associated value will be removed from the hash table. REMHASH returns T if there was such an entry, NIL otherwise.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (setf (gethash 'first-key *my-hash*) 'one)
ONE
* (gethash 'first-key *my-hash*)
ONE
T
* (remhash 'first-key *my-hash*)
T
* (gethash 'first-key *my-hash*)
NIL
NIL
* (gethash 'no-entry *my-hash*)
NIL
NIL
* (remhash 'no-entry *my-hash*)
NIL
* (gethash 'no-entry *my-hash*)
NIL
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Traversing a Hash Table ==

If you want to perform an action on each entry (i.e., each key-value pair) in a hash table, you have several options:

You can use MAPHASH which iterates over all entries in the hash table. Its first argument must be a function which accepts two arguments, the key and the value of each entry. Note that due to the nature of hash tables you can't control the order in which the entries are provided by MAPHASH (or other traversing constructs). MAPHASH always returns NIL.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (setf (gethash 'first-key *my-hash*) 'one)
ONE
* (setf (gethash 'second-key *my-hash*) 'two)
TWO
* (setf (gethash 'third-key *my-hash*) nil)
NIL
* (setf (gethash nil *my-hash*) 'nil-value)
NIL-VALUE
* (defun print-hash-entry (key value)
    (format t &quot;The value associated with the key ~S is ~S~%&quot; key value))
PRINT-HASH-ENTRY
* (maphash #'print-hash-entry *my-hash*)
The value associated with the key FIRST-KEY is ONE
The value associated with the key SECOND-KEY is TWO
The value associated with the key THIRD-KEY is NIL
The value associated with the key NIL is NIL-VALUE
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is particularly useful when you are counting or accumulating values into hash-tables. For example, the hash-table returned by the sample TALLY-TABLE function above is often going to be less useful than a function that returns an alist of the counts in question. 

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun tally-alist (list)
   (let ((table (tally-table list))
	 (result '()))
     (maphash (lambda (k v) (push (cons k v) result)) table)
     (sort result #'&gt; :key #'cdr)))
&lt;/pre&gt; 

You can also use WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR, a macro which turns (via MACROLET) its first argument into an iterator that on each invocation returns three values per hash table entry - a generalized boolean that's true if an entry is returned, the key of the entry, and the value of the entry. If there are no more entries, only one value is returned - NIL.

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; same hash-table as above
* (with-hash-table-iterator (my-iterator *my-hash*)
    (loop
      (multiple-value-bind (entry-p key value)
          (my-iterator)
        (if entry-p
            (print-hash-entry key value)
            (return)))))
The value associated with the key FIRST-KEY is ONE
The value associated with the key SECOND-KEY is TWO
The value associated with the key THIRD-KEY is NIL
The value associated with the key NIL is NIL-VALUE
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note the following caveat from the HyperSpec: &quot;It is unspecified what happens if any of the implicit interior state of an iteration is returned outside the dynamic extent of the WITH-HASH-TABLE-ITERATOR form such as by returning some closure over the invocation form.&quot;

And there's always LOOP:

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; same hash-table as above
* (loop for key being the hash-keys of *my-hash*
        do (print key))
FIRST-KEY 
SECOND-KEY 
THIRD-KEY 
NIL 
NIL
* (loop for key being the hash-keys of *my-hash*
        using (hash-value value)
        do (format t &quot;The value associated with the key ~S is ~S~%&quot; key value))
The value associated with the key FIRST-KEY is ONE
The value associated with the key SECOND-KEY is TWO
The value associated with the key THIRD-KEY is NIL
The value associated with the key NIL is NIL-VALUE
NIL
* (loop for value being the hash-values of *my-hash*
        do (print value))
ONE 
TWO 
NIL 
NIL-VALUE 
NIL
* (loop for value being the hash-values of *my-hash*
        using (hash-key key)
        do (format t &quot;~&amp;~A -&gt; ~A&quot; key value))
FIRST-KEY -&gt; ONE
SECOND-KEY -&gt; TWO
THIRD-KEY -&gt; NIL
NIL -&gt; NIL-VALUE
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Counting the Entries in a Hash Table ==

No need to use your fingers - Common Lisp has a built-in function to do it for you: HASH-TABLE-COUNT.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (hash-table-count *my-hash*)
0
* (setf (gethash 'first *my-hash*) 1)
1
* (setf (gethash 'second *my-hash*) 2)
2
* (setf (gethash 'third *my-hash*) 3)
3
* (hash-table-count *my-hash*)
3
* (setf (gethash 'second *my-hash*) 'two)
TWO
* (hash-table-count *my-hash*)
3
* (clrhash *my-hash*)
#
* (hash-table-count *my-hash*)
0
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Performance Issues: The Size of your Hash Table ==

The MAKE-HASH-TABLE function has a couple of optional parameters which control the initial size of your hash table and how it'll grow if it needs to grow. This can be an important performance issue if you're working with large hash tables. Here's an (admittedly not very scientific) example with CMUCL pre-18d on Linux:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table))
*MY-HASH*
* (hash-table-size *my-hash*)
65
* (hash-table-rehash-size *my-hash*)
1.5
* (time (dotimes (n 100000) (setf (gethash n *my-hash*) n)))
Compiling LAMBDA NIL: 
Compiling Top-Level Form: 

Evaluation took:
  0.27 seconds of real time
  0.25 seconds of user run time
  0.02 seconds of system run time
  0 page faults and
  8754768 bytes consed.
NIL
* (time (dotimes (n 100000) (setf (gethash n *my-hash*) n)))
Compiling LAMBDA NIL: 
Compiling Top-Level Form: 

Evaluation took:
  0.05 seconds of real time
  0.05 seconds of user run time
  0.0 seconds of system run time
  0 page faults and
  0 bytes consed.
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

The values for HASH-TABLE-SIZE and HASH-TABLE-REHASH-SIZE are implementation-dependent. In our case, CMUCL chooses and initial size of 65, and it will increase the size of the hash by 50 percent whenever it needs to grow. Let's see how often we have to re-size the hash until we reach the final size...

&lt;pre&gt;
* (log (/ 100000 65) 1.5)
18.099062
* (let ((size 65)) (dotimes (n 20) (print (list n size)) (setq size (* 1.5 size))))
(0 65) 
(1 97.5) 
(2 146.25) 
(3 219.375) 
(4 329.0625) 
(5 493.59375) 
(6 740.3906) 
(7 1110.5859) 
(8 1665.8789) 
(9 2498.8184) 
(10 3748.2275) 
(11 5622.3413) 
(12 8433.512) 
(13 12650.268) 
(14 18975.402) 
(15 28463.104) 
(16 42694.656) 
(17 64041.984) 
(18 96062.98) 
(19 144094.47) 
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

The hash has to be re-sized 19 times until it's big enough to hold 100,000 entries. That explains why we saw a lot of consing and why it took rather long to fill the hash table. It also explains why the second run was much faster - the hash table already had the correct size. Here's a faster way to do it: If we know in advance how big our hash will be, we can start with the right size:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table :size 100000))
*MY-HASH*
* (hash-table-size *my-hash*)
100000
* (time (dotimes (n 100000) (setf (gethash n *my-hash*) n)))
Compiling LAMBDA NIL: 
Compiling Top-Level Form: 

Evaluation took:
  0.04 seconds of real time
  0.04 seconds of user run time
  0.0 seconds of system run time
  0 page faults and
  0 bytes consed.
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's obviously much faster. And there was no consing involved because we didn't have to re-size at all. If we don't know the final size in advance but can guess the growth behaviour of our hash table we can also provide this value to MAKE-HASH-TABLE. We can provide an integer to specify absolute growth or a float to specify relative growth.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defparameter *my-hash* (make-hash-table :rehash-size 100000))
*MY-HASH*
* (hash-table-size *my-hash*)
65
* (hash-table-rehash-size *my-hash*)
100000
* (time (dotimes (n 100000) (setf (gethash n *my-hash*) n)))
Compiling LAMBDA NIL: 
Compiling Top-Level Form: 

Evaluation took:
  0.07 seconds of real time
  0.05 seconds of user run time
  0.01 seconds of system run time
  0 page faults and
  2001360 bytes consed.
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also rather fast (we only needed one re-size) but much more consing because almost the whole hash table (minus 65 initial elements) had to be built during the loop.

Note that you can also specify the REHASH-THRESHOLD while creating a new hash table. One final remark: Your implementation is allowed to completely ignore the values provided for REHASH-SIZE and REHASH-THRESHOLD...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How Macros Work==

The word macro is used generally in computer science to mean a syntactic extension to a programming language. (Note: The name comes from the word &quot;macro-instruction,&quot; which was a useful feature of many second-generation assembly languages. A macro-instruction looked like a single instruction, but expanded into a sequence of actual instructions. The basic idea has since been used many times, notably in the C preprocessor. The name &quot;macro&quot; is perhaps not ideal, since it connotes nothing relevant to what it names, but we're stuck with it.) Although many languages have a macro facility, none of them are as powerful as Lisp's. The basic mechanism of Lisp macros is simple, but has subtle complexities, so learning your way around it takes a bit of practice.

A macro is an ordinary piece of Lisp code that operates on another piece of putative Lisp code, translating it into (a version closer to) executable Lisp. That may sound a bit complicated, so let's give a simple example. Suppose you want a version of setq that sets two variables to the same value. So if you write

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (setq2 x y (+ z 3))
&lt;/source&gt;

when z = 8 both x and y are set to 11. (I can't think of any use for this, but it's just an example.)

It should be obvious that we can't define setq2 as a function. If x=50 and y=-5, this function would receive the values 50, -5, and 11; it would have no knowledge of what variables were supposed to be set. What we really want to say is, When you (the Lisp system) see (setq2 v1 v2 e), treat it as equivalent to (progn (setq v1 e) (setq v2 e)). Actually, this isn't quite right, but it will do for now. A macro allows us to do precisely this, by specifying a program for transforming the input pattern (setq2 v1 v2 e) into the output pattern (progn ...).

Here's how we could define the setq2 macro:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro setq2 (v1 v2 e)
  (list 'progn (list 'setq v1 e) (list 'setq v2 e)))
&lt;p&gt;My job&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is very close to the following function definition:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun setq2F (v1 v2 e)
  (list 'progn (list 'setq v1 e) (list 'setq v2 e)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we evaluated (setq2F 'x 'y '(+ z 3)), we would get (progn (setq x (+ z 3)) (setq y (+ z 3))). This is a perfectly ordinary Lisp computation, whose sole point of interest is that its output is a piece of executable Lisp code. What defmacro does is create this function implicitly and arrange that whenever an expression of the form (setq2 x y (+ z 3)) is seen, setq2F is called with the pieces of the form as arguments, namely x, y, and (+ z 3). The resulting piece of code then replaces the call to setq2, and execution resumes as if the new piece of code had occurred in the first place. The macro form is said to expand into the new piece of code.

This is all there is to it, except, of course, for the myriad subtle consequences. The main consequence is that run time for the setq2 macro is compile time for its context. That is, suppose the Lisp system is compiling a function, and midway through it finds the expression (setq2 x y (+ z 3)). The job of the compiler is, of course, to translate source code into something executable, such as machine language or perhaps byte code. Hence it doesn't execute the source code, but operates on it in various mysterious ways. However, once the compiler sees the setq2 expression, it must suddenly switch to executing the body of the setq2 macro. As I said, this is an ordinary piece of Lisp code, which can in principle do anything any other piece of Lisp code can do. That means that when the compiler is running, the entire Lisp (run-time) system must be present.

Novices often make the following sort of mistake. Suppose that the setq2 macro needs to do some complex transformation on its e argument before plugging it into the result. Suppose this transformation can be written as a Lisp procedure comtran. The novice will often write:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro setq2 (v1 v2 e)
   (let ((e1 (comtran e)))
      (list 'progn (list 'setq v1 e1) (list 'setq v2 e1))))


(defmacro comtran (exp) ...) ;; Wrong!
&lt;/pre&gt;

The mistake is to suppose that once a macro is called, the Lisp system enters a &quot;macro world,&quot; so naturally everything in that world must be defined using defmacro. This is the wrong picture. The right picture is that defmacro enables a step into the ordinary Lisp world, but in which the principal object of manipulation is Lisp code. Once that step is taken, one uses ordinary Lisp function definitions:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro setq2 (v1 v2 e)
   (let ((e1 (comtran e)))
      (list 'progn (list 'setq v1 e1) (list 'setq v2 e1))))


(defun comtran (exp) ...) ;; Right!
&lt;/pre&gt;

One possible explanation for this mistake may be that in other languages, such as C, invoking a preprocessor macro does get you into a different world; you can't run an arbitrary C program. It might be worth pausing to think about what it might mean to be able to.

Another subtle consequence is that we must spell out how the arguments to the macro get distributed to the hypothetical behind-the-scenes function (called setq2F in my example). In most cases, it is easy to do so: In defining a macro, we use all the usual lambda-list syntax, such as &amp;optional, &amp;rest, &amp;key, but what gets bound to the formal parameters are pieces of the macro form, not their values (which are mostly unknown, this being compile time for the macro form). So if we defined a macro thus:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro foo (x &amp;optional y &amp;key (cxt 'null)) ...)
&lt;/pre&gt;

then

If we call it thus ... 	The parameters' values are ...

(foo a) 	x=a, y=nil, cxt=null
(foo (+ a 1) (- y 1)) 	x=(+ a 1), y=(- y 1), cxt=null
(foo a b :cxt (zap zip)) 	x=a, y=b, cxt=(zap zip)

Note that the values of the variables are the actual expressions (+ a 1) and (zap zip). There is no requirement that these expressions' values be known, or even that they have values. The macro can do anything it likes with them. For instance, here's an even more useless variant of setq: (setq-reversible e1 e2 d) behaves like (setq e1 e2) if d=:normal, and behaves like (setq e2 e1) if d=:backward. It could be defined thus:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro setq-reversible (e1 e2 d)
   (case d 
      (:normal (list 'setq e1 e2))
      (:backward (list 'setq e2 e1))
      (t (error ...))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Backquote ==

Before taking another step, we need to introduce a piece of Lisp notation that is indispensable to defining macros, even though technically it is quite independent of macros. This is the backquote facility. As we saw above, the main job of a macro, when all is said and done, is to define a piece of Lisp code, and that means evaluating expressions such as (list 'prog (list 'setq ...) ...). As these expressions grow in complexity, it becomes harder to read them and write them. What we find ourselves wanting is a notation that provides the skeleton of an expression, with some of the pieces filled in with new expressions. That's what backquote provides. Instead of the list expression given above, one writes

&lt;pre&gt;
`(progn (setq v1 ,e) (setq v2 ,e))
&lt;/pre&gt;

The backquote (`) character signals that in the expression that follows, every subexpression is to be quoted, except for subexpressions preceded by a comma, which are to be evaluated.

That's mostly all there is to using the backquote. There are just two extra items to point out. First, if you write &quot;,@e&quot; instead of &quot;,e&quot;, then the value of e is ''spliced'' into the result. So if v=(oh boy), then `(zap ,@v ,v) evaluates to (zap oh boy (oh boy)). The second occurrence of v is replaced by its value. The first is replaced by the elements of its value. If v had had value (), it would have disappeared entirely: the value of (zap ,@v ,v) would have been (zap ()), which is the same as (zap nil).

Second, one might wonder what happens if a backquote expression occurs inside another backquote. The answer is that the backquote becomes essentially unreadable and unwriteable; using nested backquotes is usually a tedious debugging exercise. The reason, in my not-so-humble opinion, is that backquote is defined wrong. A comma pairs up with the innermost backquote when the default should be that it pairs up with the outermost. But this is not the place for a rant or tutorial; consult your favorite Lisp reference for the exact behavior of nested backquote plus some examples.

One problem with backquote is that once you learn it you tend to use for every list-building occasion. For instance, you might write

&lt;pre&gt;
(mapcan (lambda (x)
           (cond ((symbolp x) `((,x)))
                 ((&gt; x 10) `(,x ,x))
                 (t '())))
        some-list)
&lt;/pre&gt;

which yields ((a) 15 15) when some-list = (a 6 15). The problem is that mapcan destructively alters the results returned by the lambda-expression. Can we be sure that the lists returned by that expression are &quot;fresh,&quot; that is, they are different (in the eq sense) from the structures returned on other calls of that lambda expression? In the present case, close analysis will show that they must be fresh, but in general backquote is not obligated to return a fresh list every time (whether it does or not is implementation-dependent). If the example above got changed to

&lt;pre&gt;
(mapcan (lambda (x)
           (cond ((symbolp x) `((,x)))
                 ((&gt; x 10) `(,x ,x))
                 ((&gt;= x 0) `(low))
                 (t '())))
        some-list)
&lt;/pre&gt;

then backquote may well treat `(low) as if it were '(low); the list will be allocated at load time, and every time the lambda is evaluated, that same chunk of storage will be returned. So if we evaluate the expression with some-list = (a 6 15), we will get ((a) low 15 15), but as a side effect the constant (low) will get clobbered to become (low 15 15). If we then evaluate the expression with, say, some-list = (8 oops), the result will be (low 15 15 (oops)), and now the &quot;constant&quot; that started off as '(low) will be (low 15 15 (oops)). (Note: The bug exemplified here takes other forms, and has often bit newbies - as well as experienced programmers - in the ass. The general form is that a constant list is produced as the value of something that is later destructively altered. The first line of defense against this bug is never to destructively alter any list. For newbies, this is also the last line of defense. For those of us who imagine we're more sophisticated, the next line of defense is to think very carefully any time you use nconc or mapcan.)

To fix the bug, you can write (map 'list ...) instead of mapcan. However, if you are determined to use mapcan, write the expression this way:

&lt;pre&gt;
(mapcan (lambda (x)
           (cond ((symbolp x) (list `(,x)))
                 ((&gt; x 10) (list x x))
                 ((&gt;= x 0) (list 'low))
                 (t '())))
        some-list)
&lt;/pre&gt;

My personal preference is to use backquote only to build S-expressions, that is, hierarchical expressions that consist of symbols, numbers, and strings, and that are not conceptualized as changing in length. For instance, I would never write

&lt;pre&gt;
(setq sk `(,x ,@sk))
&lt;/pre&gt;

If sk is being used as a stack, that is, it's going to be [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_pop.htm pop]ped in the normal course of things, I would write (push x sk). If not, I would write (setq sk (cons x sk)).

== Getting Macros Right ==

I said in the first section that my definition of setq2 wasn't quite right, and now it's time to fix it.

Suppose we write (setq2 x y (+ x 3)), when x = 8. Then according to the definition given above, this form will expand into (progn (setq x (+ x 3)) (setq y (+ x 3))), so that x will have value 11 and y will have value 14. Chances are that isn't what the macro is expected to do (although you never know). Another problematic case is (setq2 x y (pop l)), which causes l to be popped twice; again, probably not right.

The solution is to evaluate e just once, save it in a temporary variable, and then set v1 and v2 to it. To make temporary variables, we use the gensym function, which returns a fresh variable guaranteed to appear nowhere else. Here is what the macro should look like:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro setq2 (v1 v2 e)
   (let ((tempvar (gensym)))
      `(let ((,tempvar ,e))
          (progn (setq ,v1 ,tempvar) 
                 (setq ,v2 ,tempvar)))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now (setq2 x y (+ x 3)) expands to

&lt;pre&gt;
   (let ((#:g2003 (+ x 3)))
      (progn (setq x #:g2003) (setq y #:g2003)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here gensym has returned the symbol #:g2003, which prints in this funny way because it won't be recognized by the reader. (Nor is there any need for the reader to recognize it, since it exists only long enough for the code that contains it to be compiled.)

Exercise: Verify that this new version works correctly for the case (setq2 x y (pop l1)).

Exercise: Try writing the new version of the macro without using backquote. If you can't do it, you have done the exercise correctly, and learned what backquote is for!

The moral of this section is to think carefully about which expressions in a macro get evaluated and when. Be on the lookout for situations where the same expression gets plugged into the output twice (as e was in my original macro design). For complex macros, watch out for cases where the order that expressions are evaluated differs from the order in which they are written. This is sure to trip up some user of the macro - even if you are the only user.

== What Macros are For ==

Macros are for making syntactic extensions to Lisp. One often hears it said that macros are a bad idea, that users can't be trusted with them, and so forth. Balderdash. It is just as reasonable to extend a language syntactically as to extend it by defining your own procedures. It may be true that the casual reader of your code can't understand the code without seeing the macro definitions, but then the casual reader can't understand it without seeing function definitions either. Having defmethods strewn around several files contributes far more to unclarity than macros ever have, but that's a different diatribe.

Before surveying what sorts of syntactic extensions I have found useful, let me point out what sorts of syntactic extensions are generally not useful, or best accomplished using means other than macros. Some novices think macros are useful for open-coding functions. So, instead of defining

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun sqone (x)
  (let ((y (+ x 1))) (* y y)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

they might define

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro sqone (x)
   `(let ((y (+ ,x 1))) (* y y)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

So that (sqone (* z 13)) might expand into

&lt;pre&gt;
(let ((y (+ (* z 13) 1)))
  (* y y))
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is correct, but a waste of effort. For one thing, the amount of time saved is almost certainly negligible. If it's really important that sqone be expanded inline, one can put (declaim (inline sqone)) before sqone is defined (although the compiler is not obligated to honor this declaration). For another, once sqone is defined as a macro, it becomes impossible to write (mapcar #'sqone ll), or to do anything else with it except call it.

A general rule is if it can be defined as a function, use a function.  You preserve a great deal of flexibility for the user and if you wanted a macro in order to make aesthetic improvements to the syntax, it is trivially easy to wrap your function in a defmacro definition.  In addition, there are ways (see compiler-macro) that you have not learned about to that give any benefit you might want from a macro definition.

But macros have a thousand and one legitimate uses. Why write (lambda (x) ...) when you can write (\\ (x) ...)? Just define \\ as a macro: (defmacro \\ (&amp;rest l) `(lambda ,@l)).

Many people find mapcar and mapcan a bit too obscure, especially when used with large lambda expressions. Rather than write something like

&lt;pre&gt;
(mapcar (lambda (x)
           (let ((y (hairy-fun1 x)) (z (hairy-fun2 x)))
              (dolist (y1 y)
                 (dolist (z1 z) 
                    ... and further meaningless
                    space-filling nonsense...
                    ))))
        l)
&lt;/pre&gt;

we might prefer to write

&lt;pre&gt;
(for (x :in l)
   (let ((y (hairy-fun1 x)) (z (hairy-fun2 x)))
      (dolist (y1 y)
         (dolist (z1 z) 
            ... and further meaningless
            space-filling nonsense...
            ))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

This macro might be defined thus:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro for (listspec exp)
   (cond ((and (= (length listspec) 3)
               (symbolp (car listspec))
               (eq (cadr listspec) ':in))
          `(mapcar (lambda (,(car listspec))
                      ,exp)
                   ,(caddr listspec)))
         (t (error &quot;Ill-formed: %s&quot; `(for ,listspec ,exp)))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

(This is a simplified version of a macro by Chris Riesbeck.)

It's worth stopping for a second to discuss the role the keyword :in plays in this macro. It serves as a sort of &quot;local syntax marker,&quot; in that it has no meaning as far as Lisp is concerned, but does serve as a syntactic guidepost for the macro itself. I will refer to these markers as guide symbols. (Here its job may seem trivial, but if we generalized the for macro to allow multiple list arguments and an implicit progn in the body the :ins would be crucial in telling us where the arguments stopped and the body began.)

It is not strictly necessary for the guide symbols of a macro to be in the keyword package, but it is a good idea, for two reasons. First, they highlight to the reader that something idiosyncratic is going on. A form like (for ((x in (foobar a b 'oof))) (something-hairy x (list x))) looks a bit wrong already, because of the double parentheses before the x. But using &quot;:in&quot; makes it more obvious.

Second, notice that I wrote (eq (cadr listspec) ':in) in the macro definition to check for the presence of the guide symbol. If I had used in instead, I would have had to think about which package my in lives in and which package the macro user's in lives in. One way to avoid trouble would be to write

&lt;pre&gt;
(and (symbolp (cadr listspec))
     (eq (intern (symbol-name (cadr listspec)) 
                 :keyword)
         ':in))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another would be to write

&lt;pre&gt;
(and (symbolp (cadr listspec))
     (string= (symbol-name (cadr listspec)) (symbol-name 'in)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

which neither of which is particularly clear or aesthetic. The keyword package is there to provide a home for symbols whose home is not per se relevant to anything; you might as well use it. (Note: In ANSI Lisp, I could have written &quot;IN&quot; instead of (symbol-name 'in), but there are Lisp implementations that do not convert symbols' names to uppercase. Since I think the whole uppercase conversion idea is an embarrassing relic, I try to write code that is portable to those implementations.)

Let's look at another example, both to illustrate a nice macro, and to provide an auxiliary function for some of the discussion below. One often wants to create new symbols in Lisp, and gensym is not always adequate for building them. Here is a description of an alternative facility called build-symbol:
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (build-symbol [(:package p)] -pieces-)
&lt;/source&gt;

builds a symbol by concatenating the given pieces and interns it as specified by p. For each element of pieces, if it is a ...

* ... string: The string is added to the new symbol's name.
* ... symbol: The name of the symbol is added to the new symbol's name.
* ... expression of the form (:&lt; e): e should evaluate to a string, symbol, or number; the characters of the value of e (as printed by princ) are concatenated into the new symbol's name.
* ... expression of the form (:++ p): p should be a place expression (i.e., appropriate as the first argument to setf), whose value is an integer; the value is incremented by 1, and the new value is concatenated intot he new symbol's name. 

If the :package specification is omitted, it defaults to the value of *package*. If p is nil, the symbol is interned nowhere. Otherwise, it should evaluate to a package designator (usually, a keyword whose name is the same of a package). 

For example, (build-symbol (:&lt; x) &quot;-&quot; (:++ *x-num*)), when x = foo and *x-num* = 8, sets *x-num* to 9 and evaluates to FOO-9. If evaluated again, the result will be FOO-10, and so forth.

Obviously, build-symbol can't be implemented as a function; it has to be a macro. Here is an implementation:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defmacro build-symbol (&amp;rest l)
   (let ((p (find-if (lambda (x) (and (consp x) (eq (car x) ':package)))
                     l)))
      (cond (p
             (setq l (remove p l))))
      (let ((pkg (cond ((eq (cadr p) 'nil)
                        nil)
                       (t `(find-package ',(cadr p))))))
         (cond (p
                (cond (pkg
                       `(values (intern ,(symstuff l) ,pkg)))
                      (t
                       `(make-symbol ,(symstuff l)))))
               (t
                `(values (intern ,(symstuff l))))))))

(defun symstuff (l)
   `(concatenate 'string
      ,@(for (x :in l)
           (cond ((stringp x)
                  `',x)
                 ((atom x)
                  `',(format nil &quot;~a&quot; x))
                 ((eq (car x) ':&lt;)
                  `(format nil &quot;~a&quot; ,(cadr x)))
                 ((eq (car x) ':++)
                  `(format nil &quot;~a&quot; (incf ,(cadr x))))
                 (t
                  `(format nil &quot;~a&quot; ,x))))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Another approach would be have symstuff return a single call of the form (format nil format-string -forms-), where the forms are derived from the pieces, and the format-string consists of interleaved ~a's and strings.)

Sometimes a macro is needed only temporarily, as a sort of syntactic scaffolding. Suppose you need to define 12 functions, but they fall into 3 stereotyped groups of 4:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun make-a-zip (y z)
  (vector 2 'zip y z))
(defun test-whether-zip (x)
  (and (vectorp x) (eq (aref x 1) 'zip)))
(defun zip-copy (x) ...)
(defun zip-deactivate (x) ...)


(defun make-a-zap (u v w) (vector 3 'zap u v w)) (defun test-whether-zap (x) ...) (defun zap-copy (x) ...) (defun zap-deactivate (x) ...)

(defun make-a-zep () (vector 0 'zep)) (defun test-whether-zep (x) ...) (defun zep-copy (x) ...) (defun zep-deactivate (x) ...)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Where the omitted pieces are the same in all similarly named functions. (That is, the &quot;...&quot; in zep-deactivate is the same code as the &quot;...&quot; in zip-deactivate, and so forth.) Here, for the sake of concreteness, if not plausibility, zip, zap, and zep are behaving like odd little data structures. The functions could be rather large, and it would get tedious keeping them all in synch as they are debugged. An alternative would be to use a macro:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defmacro odd-define (name buildargs)
   `(progn (defun ,(build-symbol make-a- (:&lt; name)) 
                                 ,buildargs
              (vector ,(length buildargs) ',name ,@buildargs))
           (defun ,(build-symbol test-whether- (:&lt; name)) (x)
              (and (vectorp x) (eq (aref x 1) ',name))
           (defun ,(build-symbol (:&lt; name) -copy) (x) 
              ...)
           (defun ,(build-symbol (:&lt; name) -deactivate) (x) 
              ...))))


(odd-define zip (y z)) (odd-define zap (u v w)) (odd-define zep ())
&lt;/source&gt;

If all the uses of this macro are collected in this one place, it might be clearer to make it a local macro using macrolet:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(macrolet ((odd-define (name buildargs)
              `(progn (defun ,(build-symbol make-a- (:&lt; name)) 
                                            ,buildargs
                         (vector ,(length buildargs) 
                                 ',name
                                  ,@buildargs))
                      (defun ,(build-symbol test-whether- (:&lt; name)) 
                             (x)
                         (and (vectorp x) (eq (aref x 1) ',name))
                      (defun ,(build-symbol (:&lt; name) -copy) (x) 
                         ...)
                      (defun ,(build-symbol (:&lt; name) -deactivate) (x)
                          ...)))))
   (odd-define zip (y z))
   (odd-define zap (u v w))
   (odd-define zep ()))
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, macros are essential for defining &quot;command languages.&quot; A command is a function with a short name for use by users in interacting with Lisp's read-eval-print loop. A short name is useful and possible because we want it to be easy to type and we don't care much whether the name clashes some other command; if two command names clash, we can change one of them.

As an example, let's define a little command language for debugging macros. (You may actually find this useful.) There are just two commands, ex and fi. They keep track of a &quot;current form,&quot; the thing to be macro-expanded or the result of such an expansion:

# (ex [form]): Apply macro-expand1 to form (if supplied) or the current form, and make the result the current form. Then pretty-print the current form.
# (fi s [k]): Find the k'th subexpression of the current form whose car is s. (k defaults to 0.) Make that subexpression the current form and pretty-print it. 

Suppose you're trying to debug a macro hair-squared that expands into something complex containing a subform that is itself a macro form beginning with the symbol odd-define. You suspect there is a bug in the subform. You might issue the following commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
&gt; (ex (hair-squared ...))
(PROGN (DEFUN ...)
         (ODD-DEFINE ZIP (U V W))
         ...)
&gt; (fi odd-define)
(ODD-DEFINE ZIP (U V W))
&gt; (ex)
(PROGN (DEFUN MAKE-A-ZIP (U V W) ...)        
   ...)
&lt;/source&gt;

Once again, it is clear that ex and fi cannot be functions, although they could easily be made into functions if we were willing to type a quote before their arguments. But using &quot;quote&quot; often seems inappropriate in commands. For one thing, having to type it is a nuisance in a context where we are trying to save keystrokes, especially if the argument in question is always quoted. For another, in many cases it just seems inappropriate. If we had a command that took a symbol as one of its arguments and set it to a value, it would just be strange to write (command 'x ...) instead of (command x ...), because we want to think of the command as a variant of setq.

Here is how ex and fi might be defined:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defvar *current-form*)

(defmacro ex (&amp;optional (form nil form-supplied))
   `(progn
       (pprint (setq *current-form*
                     (macroexpand-1
                        ,(cond (form-supplied
                                `',form)
                               (t '*current-form*)))))
       (values)))

(defmacro fi (s &amp;optional (k 0))
   `(progn
       (pprint (setq *current-form*
                    (find-nth-occurrence ',s *current-form* ,k)))
       (values)))
&lt;/source&gt;

The ex macro expands to a form containing a call to macroexpand-1, a built-in function that does one step of macro expansion to a form whose car is the name of a macro. (If given some other form, it returns the form unchanged.) pprint is a built-in function that pretty-prints its argument. Because we are using ex and fi at a read-eval-print loop, any value returned by their expansions will be printed. Here the expansion is executed for side effect, so we arrange to return no values at all by having the expansion return (values).

In some Lisp implementations, read-eval-print loops routinely print results using pprint. In those implementations we could simplify ex and fi by having them print nothing, but just return the value of *current-form*, which the read-eval-print loop will then print prettily. Use your judgment.

I leave the definition of find-nth-occurrence as an exercise. You might also want to define a command that just sets and prints the current form: (cf e).

One caution: In general, command languages will consist of a mixture of macros and functions, with convenience for their definer (and usually sole user) being the main consideration. If a command seems to &quot;want&quot; to evaluate some of its arguments sometimes, you have to decide whether to define two (or more) versions of it, or just one, a function whose arguments must be quoted to prevent their being evaluated. For the cf command mentioned in the previous paragraph, some users might prefer cf to be a function, some a macro.

==Introduction==
Unicode is an industry standard whose goal is to provide the means by which text of all forms and languages can be encoded for use by computers through a single character set. Originally, text-characters were represented in computers using byte-wide data: each printable character (and many non-printing, or &quot;control&quot; characters) were implemented using a single byte each, which allowed for 256 characters total. However, globalization has created a need for computers to be able to accommodate many different alphabets (and other writing systems) from around the world in an interchangeable way.

The old encodings in use included ASCII or EBCDIC, but it was apparent that they were not capable of handling all the different characters and alphabets from around the world. The solution to this problem was to create a set of &quot;wide&quot; 16-bit characters that would theoretically be able to accommodate most international language characters. This new charset was first known as the ''Universal Character Set'' (UCS), and later standardized as Unicode. However, after the first versions of the Unicode standard it became clear that 65,535 (2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) characters would still not be enough to represent every character from all scripts in existence, so the standard was amended to add sixteen ''supplementary planes'' of 65,536 characters each, thus bringing the total number of representable ''code points'' to 1,114,112. To this date, less than 10% of that space is in use.

== General notes ==
''What follows will find a place in the wikibook if actually useful for a novice user.''

Managing passwords is important for security.
*Random letters and numbers are hard to remember, and do not improve security (Prof. Ross Anderson dixit)
*Another suggestion would be to use word initials in a long sentence.
*Bruce Schneier suggested making a note of a complex password and keeping it in your wallet. Contrariwise, stick-em-up's attached to a computer screen with a password written on them are questionable.

Computer security does not only deal with malware, but also with preventing data loss (how to make backups in WinXP?) Redundancy using RAIDs?

There are also side-channel attacks like Tempest (electromagnetic leakage of information, e.g. the contents of a computer screen) but they are a bit far-fetched for a home user.

Trying to make sense of definitions:

Malware (malicious software) is a generic term for software that does something sneaky. It can be a
virus (replicates on your file system),
worm (spreads over a network), 
dialer (worst case scenario: silently drops your connection, dials a premium-rate number, and changes your dialup parameters to always use that number. Luckily ADSL and cable connections are immune; your phone company may also give you the option to block certain calls, and/or be obliged by law [?] to refund you if you have been cheated in this way), 
browser hijacker (changes the browser home page: typically a search portal with pay-per-click links or something more unpleasant; may lock it from changes, may reset it at every reboot), 
backdoor (RAT, remote access trojan), 
keylogger (intercepts passwords and credit card numbers as you type them, sent elsewhere along with screenshots), botnet client (DDoS attacks, spam relayers), 
macro virus (written in a [human-readable?] macro language, works only when executed by the host program; since it depends only on that program's macro features it may be multi-platform),
rootkit (stealth techniques, &quot;sits&quot; between the system and the user and gives false information about the system, e.g. hiding files)

*Is a logic bomb simply a payload-carrying malware?
*A trojan (horse) is not a specific type of malware but more of a packaging format (tries to deceive you into activating it, requires user intervention like opening an email attachment).
*A malformed data file may act as a dropper (it contains malicious code that exploits a buffer overflow or similar bug to execute when the file is opened by its associated program)   

*spyware, steal/thiefware:  ... jargon?
*&quot;ransomware&quot; recently appeared: it extorts money by locking you from your data (e.g. encrypting or deleting a file every 30 minutes). You are forced to transfer money on some bank account to make it stop. Backups should work. Although the actual implementations had weak cryptography, expect them to get better.
*Bogus &quot;anti-spyware&quot;: claims to remove evil spyware, but actually a hoax (to make a quick buck) or a trojan installer. It may be bundled with spyware, and actually remove spyware and then install other spyware. The &quot;bad guys&quot; are cheating each other too.
Deception is an important part of any war.

*&quot;ActiveX vulnerabilities? ActiveX '''is''' a vulnerability&quot; [?].

*Malware is an excellent reason to avoid porn/casino sites, even if you like them. And monitor what your children are doing on the Internet!

How you could get infected:
In the olden days of DOS (before the availability of the Internet), floppy disks (and Bulletin Board Systems, reminiscent of today's FTP servers) with, say, copies of pirated software were the only vehicles for viruses. You either executed an infected program or accidentally left a disk in your floppy drive while booting the system (boot sector viruses).
Viruses were constrained in size because of limited memory (in DOS real mode, 8080-CPU compatible, programs could only use the first 640KB of RAM).

These days are long gone. &lt;!-- a flair of the dramatic --&gt;
...

USB Memory sticks can perform a data transferal using DMA (Direct Memory Access). [TODO:explain it better...] Until this vulnerability is fixed, you shouldn't out of curiosity plug in anything you find lying around... 

To find out if a program has been trojaned: compare its digital fingerprint with the expected one (use SHA-1, flaws have been found in MD5). If they differ, the downloaded file is either corrupt or not what you expect it to be.

== Passwords ==
Worth a mention that there are a number of free password programs out there that (AFAIK) offer good password security? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:04, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

Good morning, Herby!&lt;br&gt;
Probably worth it. I only tried [http://www.schneier.com/passsafe.html Password Safe] some time ago but didn't like it because it wasn't flexible (mandatory 5-min password expiration, obfuscation). At home my security requirements are not so demanding.&lt;br&gt;
BTW, I usually write my passwords h4x0r style, do you think that is good practice?
[[User:Tortoise|Tortoise]] 09:39, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
:Use Keepass myself - a year or so back I realised it was getting out of hand (using the same password for almost everything) so wandered around the web a bit and found that one best for me.  A site that probably got me most interested in comp security would be www.grc.com - first thing I do on a new machine is check shieldsup.  BTW what timezone are you (tho won't be around now for a couple of hours)? 
:When I get time I think I'll do a &quot;browser&quot; bit (something I feel strongly that people should understand better) - subpage maybe? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:48, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

Perhaps you could write about the password programs since you seem to have more experience.&lt;br&gt;
My timezone is +01:00 GMT (Italy), yours? [[User:Tortoise|Tortoise]] 10:32, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

:Hum - the problem is as always - time.  By comparison to some things I am quite passionate about computer security.  As you say there are different issues comparing home and work - I trust me!  I'll look at the password issue.
:I do think browsers are something that should be addressed.  Just because a machine arrived with IE doesn't make it right.  I am basically anti MS however the point is more that exploits will be more often/easily found in IE.  These days FF (with spellcheck) and some extension such as Noscript combined with a well loaded HOSTS file can make clicking on links a much less risky business.  When I evaluate links here for spam/appropriateness if they don't load as a result of the HOSTS file I remove them anyway for others safety.
:FWIW this is one I really like - [http://members.lycos.co.uk/codestuff/] - deals in a very elegant neat way with services &amp; startup items (IMO).
:I'm UK based.  You've done good work on that article, I hope you stick around and keep contributing - let me know if I can help and I will try and contribute to the page myself --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:50, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

If you meant to point me to the 'Starter' Program, have a look at http://www.sysinternals.com ... (gosh, Microsoft acquired them in July... but the programs are still there).
I'm not sure what you mean with doing the 'Services' subpage together... I don't like to casually write about something I know little about. [[User:Tortoise|Tortoise]] 16:57, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

@Herby:
Sorry for disappearing, my ADSL connection stopped working today (seems ISP's fault).
Since you have little time don't worry about style, just list facts you know somewhere (or give pointers). And don't feel compelled to dedicate hours on end to the wikibook -- have a life (I hope you don't find this offensive).
BTW I never logged out before disconnecting, does this mean I appeared to be online forever?
[[User:Tortoise|Tortoise]] 19:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== Style? ==

Just wondering if standardising the style would be good - after I'd done mine in the form of '''something to be typed''' I realised you had done it a little differently.  Fell free to change mine or talk it thro.  Lunch where you are sounds waaay better than what I just had! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:32, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

Not sure... I never seem to make up my mind. Samples:&lt;br&gt;
#Type &lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot;&gt;'''&lt;code&gt;format c: /q&lt;/code&gt;'''&lt;/font&gt; and then choose Yes.
#Type &quot;format c: /q&quot; and then choose Yes. (bad style I think)
#Type &lt;font color=&quot;darkgray&quot;&gt;'''format c: /q'''&lt;/font&gt; and then choose Yes.

Ah, got it. We'll use your style. Quickly typed and can be easily changed later using a text search.

Hi - I notice that you have made some extensive contributions to a Cookbook page.  Please be aware that no copyrighting is possible on Wikibooks.  I wll review the page and images later but it is possible that these will need to be deleted as copyright violations.  Equally external links should not be required on most Wikibook pages.  I will get back to you --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:08, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

== response ==

Oh, they images do belong to me and they are free to be published as long as I am credited.  I guess copyright is not the correct term since I'd like them to be on some sort of public license.  I think BSD is the appropriate one, but i'm not sure.  any advice would be appreciated.  --[[User:Filbertman|Filbertman]] 08:26, 16 December 2006 (UTC)
:Yeah - first thing for me here so on review I see that (&amp; the fact that the stuff on the page had a copyright symbol before you got to it).  I'll look into it as the day (for me) goes on - licensing is not my strong point but I will get back to you - thanks for responding and contributing --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:48, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

= Philidor Defence =
White is now down a pawn. Black has given up most of his center control to White's pawn and Knight. White's best move would be to take the undefended pawn. If the pawn is left there, Black's next move will be to strengthen it and it will become a thorn in White's side. Although [[/4. Nxd4/]] seems logical, [[/4. Qxd4/]] is also an interesting option.

      <comment>/* Delimited identifiers */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Delimited identifiers ===

There are '''regular identifiers''' and '''delimited identifiers''' to denominate database objects like tables or columns. You must apply delimited identifiers if you want to use SQL keywords like 'FROM' as identifiers or special characters within its name. Delimited identifiers are labeled by the following techniques. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Dialect
! Sample 
! Comment
|-
| '''Standard''' 
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt; 
| The SQL standard calls these &quot;delimited identifiers&quot;. The SQL standard requires that delimited identifiers are case-sensitive, although not all servers enforce this.
|-
| '''{{DB2 v9 ref|r0000720.htm|DB2}}'''
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| Case sensitive per standard and also allows special characters
|-
| '''Firebird'''
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| Case sensitive per standard
|-
| '''Ingres'''
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| Case sensitivity for delimited identifiers is specified when a database is created. For compliance with ANSI/ISO Entry SQL-92, delimited identifiers must be case sensitive.
|-
| '''MonetDB'''
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| Case sensitive per standard
|-
| '''MSSQL'''
| &lt;code&gt;[identifier]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSQL_QuotedIdentifier&quot;&gt;If the '''quoted_identifier''' option is set '''on''' — otherwise, &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt; would be parsed as a string in single quotes&lt;/ref&gt;
| Case sensitivity is set by a per-database option.
|-
| '''MySQL'''
| &lt;code&gt;`identifier`&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MySQL_ANSIMode&quot;&gt;If running in ANSI mode.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| '''Oracle'''
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| Oracle's delimited identifiers are case-sensitive. Regular identifiers are case-insensitive. They are converted to uppercase before the execution of any statement, e.g: 'CREATE TABLE MyTable' is converted to 'CREATE TABLE MYTABLE' and 'SELECT * FROM mytable' to 'SELECT * FROM MYTABLE'. Therefore regular identifiers matches independent from their spelling.
|-
| '''PostgreSQL'''
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| Case sensitive per standard, or case insensitive without escaping (folded to lowercase not per standard)
|-
| '''SQLite'''
| &lt;code&gt;[identifier]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code&gt;'identifier'&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code&gt;identifier&lt;/code&gt;
| Bracketed keywords are always understood as identifiers. Double-quoted keywords are understood as identifiers if previously seen as such, but are otherwise interpreted as string literals. Single-quoted keywords are interpreted as string literals where such are allowed, but otherwise as identifiers. Some keywords may be used as identifiers even when not quoted.
|-
| '''Virtuoso'''
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| '''Linter'''
| &lt;code&gt;&quot;identifier&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
| Case sensitive per standard

__TOC__
&lt;/div&gt;

A short hint: In most cases auto-increment columns are used as Primary Key columns. In the SQL standard the junction of the two concepts is not mandatory.

== [[w:SQL|SQL Standard]]  ==
The SQL standard defines two ways to generate auto-increment values. First, there are ''identity columns'' as an extention to exact numeric types. The syntax is: &quot;GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY&quot;. Second, the use of sequences in combination with triggers is standardized.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 DECIMAL GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY);
&lt;/source&gt;

== [[w:IBM DB2|DB2]] ==
Identity columns or sequences combined with triggers ([http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v8/topic/com.ibm.db2.udb.doc/admin/c0004994.htm comparison] of both techniques).
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 INT GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY);

--  or:

CREATE TABLE t1 (col1 INT);
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name;
CREATE TRIGGER insert_trigger
       NO CASCADE BEFORE INSERT ON t1
       REFERENCING NEW AS n
       FOR EACH ROW
  SET n.col1 = NEXTVAL FOR sequence_name;
&lt;/source&gt;

== [[w:Firebird (database server)|Firebird]] ==
Is recommended to use [http://www.firebirdsql.org/manual/generatorguide-sqlsyntax.html#generatorguide-sqlsyntax-overview sequences] combined with triggers . From 3.0 there is [http://firebird.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/firebird/firebird/trunk/doc/sql.extensions/README.identity_columns.txt?revision=51203 Identity] support.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SET TERM  ^;
CREATE TABLE t1(col1 INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY)^
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name^
ALTER  SEQUENCE sequence_name RESTART WITH 0^

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name FOR t1
BEFORE INSERT
AS
BEGIN
  NEW.col1 = NEXT VALUE FOR sequence_name;
END^ 
&lt;/source&gt;

== [[w:Linter|Linter]] ==
AUTOINC columns (maybe with RANGEs) or sequences combined with triggers.
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Select without tables ===

Sometimes one needs to execute SQL scalar expressions without table context, i.e. make a query that would act as normal SELECT operator, evaluate given comma-separated ''expressions'' and return a table with single row and one or multiple columns (one for every individual expression). Obviously, ''expressions'' can't reference any columns from the tables, as there are none.

{{SQL comparison block entry
|DB2 = &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* VALUES
* SELECT ''expressions'' FROM sysibm.sysdummy1
|Firebird = SELECT ''expressions'' FROM rdb$database
|Ingres = SELECT ''expressions''
|Linter = SELECT ''expressions''
|MySQL = &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* SELECT ''expressions''
* SELECT ''expressions'' FROM dual
|MSSQL = SELECT ''expressions''
|MonetDB = SELECT ''expressions''

* {{PostgreSQL ref|sql-values.html|VALUES (''expressions'')}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Limiting results of select query ===

Note that ''end_row = start_row + num_rows - 1''

{{SQL comparison block entry
|standard = SELECT columns FROM table FETCH FIRST num_rows ROWS ONLY&lt;br /&gt;

|DB2 = SELECT columns FROM table FETCH FIRST num_rows ROWS ONLY

&lt;pre&gt;SELECT columns FROM table ROWS start_row TO end_row&lt;/pre&gt;
All versions
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT FIRST num_rows SKIP start_row columns FROM table&lt;/pre&gt;
|Ingres = &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* {{Ingres ref|SQL%20Reference%20Guide/selectinteractive.htm#o1349|SELECT FIRST ''num_rows'' ''columns'' FROM ''table''}}

|MSSQL=
Simple version (when start_row = 1)
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT TOP num_rows columns FROM table&lt;/pre&gt;
Complex version (full-featured, requires ordering)
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT TOP num_rows columns FROM (
    SELECT TOP num_rows + start_row columns FROM table ORDER BY some_key ASC
  ) AS newtable ORDER BY some_key DESC
) AS newtable2 ORDER BY some_key ASC&lt;/pre&gt;
|MySQL=
Versions &amp;gt; 4.0.14
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT num_rows OFFSET start_row&lt;/pre&gt;
All versions
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT start_row, num_rows&lt;/pre&gt;
|MonetDB = SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT num_rows OFFSET start_row
|Oracle=
Simple query
&lt;pre&gt;
-- Notice: Will not work, if start_row &gt; 1, since the first row will return false, and the cursor will terminate.
SELECT columns FROM table WHERE rownum &gt;= start_row AND rownum &lt;= end_row
&lt;/pre&gt;

This works fine without specifying start_row:
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT columns FROM table WHERE rownum &lt;= end_row&lt;/pre&gt;

This also works, but suffix num column in resultset:
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT temp.*, rownum num FROM table ORDER BY columns
  ) WHERE num &gt;= start_row and num &lt;= end_row
&lt;/pre&gt;

Since 12.1:
&lt;pre&gt;SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT start_row, end_row&lt;/pre&gt;

|PostgreSQL = SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT num_rows OFFSET start_row
|SQLite = SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT num_rows OFFSET start_row
|Virtuoso = 
&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT TOP num_rows columns FROM table
SELECT TOP skip_rows,num_rows columns FROM table
&lt;/pre&gt;
|Linter=
&lt;pre&gt;
SELECT columns FROM table FETCH FIRST num_rows
SELECT columns FROM table LIMIT start_row, num_rows
(rows are numbered from 0)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=Philidor Counter-Gambit=
The situation is getting complicated. Black deliberately weakened his king-side to keep chances at the center. 

:[[/4. dxe5/]] isn't the best solution. After 4...fxe4, the knight is forced to move to d4 or d2, blocking queen's attack against the Black pawn. Then, Black can rebuild his center with d5. A few game have been tried with 5. Ng5 where Black development is made harder by the White pawn.
:[[/4. exf5/]] may lead to weird pawn structures in both camps. If 4...exd4 5. Nxd4 White has only an advanced pawn on f file left, while Black has still his d6 pawn (but with a weakened king side).
:[[/4. Bc4/]] poses the Ng5 threat and Black should remain vigilant for any attempt to launch a Qh5+ attack.
:[[/4. Nc3/]] defends the attacked pawn and prepares a deadly trap. If 4...fxe4 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Nxe5 dxe4 6. Qh5+ g6 7. Nxg6 and the situation is bad for Black.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Resistant varieties''' are plants within a certain group that are less vulnerable to attack by plant pests or diseases. In seed catalogs, these are often indicated by codes, which may vary from company to company. 

The use of resistant varieties is strongly recommended if pest or disease issues have arisen in the past.

The '''black vine weevil''', ''Otiorhynchus sulcatus'', is native to Europe, but common in North America as well. This weevil is a pest of many garden plants, causing the most damage on evergreen trees and shrubs. 

The adult weevil is black with fused wing covers, and is unable to fly. Adults feed at night on the outer edges of leaves, causing the leaves to have a notched margin. 

Grubs live below the soil surface, and feed on the roots and on the cambium at the base of the trunk.

__TOC__

==Safety==

===Safety Class===

Choose a fitting safety class for this description

*'''Too dangerous!''' (We do not make this experiment because …)

*Very dangerous (Should only be attempted after careful training)

*Dangerous - Please be aware of this or the other thing... (Untrained people can do this experiment under supervision and guidance)

*Harmless (The most dangerous thing is this insignificant little petitesse)


===Required Safety Equipment===

*The show performer: Glasses / Lab coat / Nothing / Fire extinguisher / Wet towel and a bucket of water / Eye flushing bottle

*Audience/participants: Safety screens / Hearing protection (a finger in the ear is often a help).


==Materials==


You'll need the following - make a list

* item 1: formula, CAS number, supplier [http://www.someshop.com], Safety issues (describe the most important ones), Storage, link to safety datasheet

==Procedure==

*Preparation time

*Performance time

*Clean-up time.

===Step by step===

#Start by…

#…

#End with explaining how to properly get rid of waste products


===Alternative methods===

Other ways to do the experiment


===Dangers===

Now the reader knows the experiment, give a closer description of possible dangers.

*Important, be aware of…

*Consider the…


===Other Factors===

What other things can sometimes affect the result of the experiment. Maybe the humidity or cleanliness of the glass ware is an issue.

===Show notes===

What to consider when preparing. How to make it more spectacular. What can be difficult to achieve 'on stage' that normally is easy when practising.

What other experiments are good to that have in relation to this one?

What should you beware of that can make the experiment boring?

==Explanation==

===What's taking place===

Here you can give a more quantitative and mathematical description of what happens. What fundamental laws are involved or demonstrated by this experiment etc. Remember to explain jargon/expressions from the laboratory.

===In the real world===

Do you meet things like this in daily life - give examples!

===Uanswered Questions===

Things we do not yet know and should find an answer to - maybe how it actually works etc.


==More Information==

*[http://end.net Websites with more info] the end.

===Acknowledgements===

===References===

See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes Wikipedia:Footnotes] for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags &lt;ref&gt; example reference &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Remember==

This is just a guide and it can contain both errors and omissions. Always make experiments in small versions before proceeding to larger quantities where things could become dangerous. Ask around if you have any doubts before starting and do not start on a procedure you do not feel you understand and is qualified to perform.

Now, Black has to choose between the two pawns which to capture : [[/3...exd4/]] or [[/3...Nxe4/]]. Unless he wants to keep on playing a symmetrical game with [[/3...d5/]].

=Caution=

These are only guides and can contain both errors and omissions.

Always make experiments in small versions before proceeding to larger quantities where things could become dangerous.

Ask around if you have any doubts before starting. Do not attempt to perform an experiment you do not feel you understand and is qualified to perform -some of the experiments described here contain dangerous materials and the dangers can be subtle.

Prepare yourself before starting and exercise due care! It is not fun science if it is dangerous and chaotically performed.

=Guides=
The table below lists all the guides alfabetically, together with:
*The status of the guide (fairly complete {{stage short|100%}}, Some omissions {{stage short|75%}}, Safety info ok {{stage short|50%}}, Still sketchy {{stage short|25%}})
*How harmless or dangerous it is
*The level of equipment and practice thats required (household, specialized lab...)
*An overview of the subjects the experiment relates to.

==Allergens==
There are many allergens, not all of which are foods, and any food can potentially be an allergen, however some foods are more common causes of allergies than others.  There are some particularly common food allergens, warnings of the presence of these in foods are normally in an &quot;Allergy Advice&quot; section underneath the ingredients list on food packaging.  Some of the main food allergens are:
* Nuts
* Legumes (particularly peanuts and soya)
* Egg
* Milk
* Fish
* Shellfish
* Wheat
* Sesame seeds
* Corn
* Maize

==Alternative names==
Confusingly, when these ingredients are present in foods, although they will be mentioned on the ingredients list there are many different names for some of these.  This is normally due to the ingredients specifying, for example, the part of milk present rather than stating 'milk'.  This is less of a problem with foods which are mentioned in the allergy advice section.  Below are some of the alternative names which can be found.

Soya:
* edamame
* miso
* natto
* shoyu sauce
* soya (soya albumin, soya fiber, soya flour, soya grits, soya milk, soya nuts, soya sprouts)
* soya
* soyabean (curd, granules)
* soyabean butter
* soya protein (concentrate, isolate)
* soya sauce, tamari
* tempeh
* textured vegetable protein (TVP)
* tofu
* E322 is sometimes derived from soya bean.
* E476 is sometimes derived from soya bean.

Egg:
* E322 can be derived from egg

Milk:
* Lactose
* Whey
* Whey powder

This recipe can be adapted for people with an allergy by substituting the ingredients for equivalents. For example, to make this suitable for people with milk or dairy allergy use a dairy free margarine.


==Ingredients==
* Margarine
* Flour
* Fruit (some fruit can cause allergies, particularly kiwifruit and strawberry)
* Sugar

==Procedure==
# Rub together 85g (3oz) margarine with 170g (6oz) flour.
# If you are using cooking apples then core them, peel them and cut them up into small pieces.  Add the fruit to an oven safe bowl.
# Sprinkle a desert spoon of sugar onto the fruit.
# Sprinkle the crumble onto the fruit until the fruit is covered by a thick layer of crumble.
# Put in the oven at 160°C (320°F) for 30mins (alter the time and temperature to suit the oven, the time and temperature may also need adjusting for different size fruit crumbles).

Various gluten free and wheat free flours are available.  For people with celiac disease and no wheat allergy, gluten free flour is probably the best option as it is the most similar to normal flour.  Gluten free flour is available in most supermarkets and can be obtained on prescription in some places if you have a diagnosis of celiac disease.  Wheat free flours are a little more difficult to get hold of and can be harder to cook with but there are many different types available.  Be aware that some wheat free flours still contain gluten, however wheat free and gluten free flours are available.  Some of the most common wheat free flours are: potato flour, rice flour and soya flour.

This is a popular dessert which can be made in less than an hour.

==Suitability==
* Oats are unsuitable for people with wheat allergy because oats are normally ground with wheat.
* Oats are unsuitable for some people with Coeliac disease because the oats are normally ground with wheat.
* To make this recipe suitable for people with milk or soya allergy use a dairy free, soya free margarine.

==Ingredients==
* 150g (6oz) [[cookbook:margarine|Margarine]]
* 75g (3oz) [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]]
* 200g (8oz) Quick rolled [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]] (not porridge oats)
* 75g (3oz) Syrup

==Procedure==
# Melt the margarine gently in a saucepan.
# Once the margarine has melted, add the syrup into the saucepan and stir well.
# Add the sugar into the saucepan and stir well.
# Add the quick rolled oats into the saucepan and stir well until well mixed.
# Press the mixture into a well greased non-stick tin.
# Bake at 180°C (350°F) for 30 minutes (change as necessary for the oven).
# Leave to cool in the tin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''You shall not covet''' is one of the Ten Commandments,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20:1-21, Deuteronomy 5:1-23, ‘’Ten Commandments,’’ New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174-1175&lt;/ref&gt; which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Post-Reformation scholars.&lt;ref&gt;How Judges Think, Richard A. Posner, Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 322; ‘’Ten Commandments,’’ New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174-1175; The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Geoffrey W. Bromiley, 1988, p. 117; Renewal theology: systematic theology from a charismatic perspective, J. Rodman Williams, 1996 p.240; Making moral decisions: a Christian approach to personal and social ethics, Paul T. Jersild, 1991, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The book of Exodus describes the Ten Commandments as being spoken by God to Moses,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 20:1&lt;/ref&gt; inscribed on two stone tablets by the finger of God,&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 31:18, Deuteronomy 9:10, Catholic Catechism 2056, http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2.htm, ‘’Ten Commandments,’’ New Bible Dictionary, Second Edition, Tyndale House, 1982 pp. 1174-1175 &lt;/ref&gt; and later written on tablets by Moses.&lt;ref&gt;Exodus 34:28&lt;/ref&gt;  The full text of the commandment reads:
{{quotation|You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.| Exodus 20:17 (NIV)}}

Unlike the other commandments which focus on outward actions, this commandment focuses on the human heart.  It is an imperative against setting one’s desire on things that are forbidden.  One commandment forbids the act of adultery.  This commandment forbids the desire for adultery.  One commandment forbids stealing.  This commandment forbids the desire for unjust acquisition of another’s goods.  The New Testament describes Jesus as interpreting the Ten Commandments as issues of the heart’s desires rather than merely prohibiting certain outward actions.
{{quotation| You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, “Do not murder,” and “anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.” But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment…You have heard that it was said, “Do not commit adultery.” But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.| Matthew 5:21-22, 27-28 (NIV)}}

The command against coveting is seen as a natural consequence of the command to “love your neighbor as yourself.”&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 19:18, Romans 13:9, Catechism of the Catholic Church 2514-2533 http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The prohibition against desiring forbidden things is also seen as a moral imperative for the individual to exercise control over the thoughts of his mind and the desires of his heart.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Ha-chinukh, Mitzva 416, http://www.vbm-torah.org/parsha.63/17yitro.htm &lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Ancient usage ==

The Hebrew word translated “covet” is “chamad” which can be translated into English as “covet”, “lust”, and “strong desire.”&lt;ref&gt;The NIV Complete Concordance, Zondervan, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hebrew Bible contains a number of warnings and examples of negative consequences for lusting or coveting.  For example, when God was instructing Israel regarding the false religion of the Canaanites, he warned them not to covet the silver or gold on their idols, because this can lead to bringing detestable things into the home.
{{quotation| The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the LORD your God.  Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Utterly abhor and detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.| Deuteronomy 7:25-26 (NIV)}}The Book of Joshua contains a narrative in which Achan incurred the wrath of God by coveting prohibited gold and silver that he found in the destruction of Jericho.  This is portrayed as a violation of covenant and a disgraceful thing.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The book of Proverbs warns against coveting, “Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.”&lt;ref&gt;Proverbs 4:23 (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt;  The prophet Micah condemns the coveting of houses and fields as a warning against lusting after physical possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Micah 2:2&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hebrew word for “covet” can also be translated as “lust,” and the book of Proverbs warns against coveting in the form of sexual lust.{{quotation| Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes,  for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life. | Proverbs 6:25-26 (NIV)}}

==Jewish interpretation==
Maimonides (the Rambam) viewed the prohibition of coveting as a fence or boundary intended to keep adherents a safe distance away from the very serious sins of theft, adultery, and murder. 
{{quotation|Desire leads to coveting, and coveting leads to stealing. For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (Mikha 2:2) [Micah 2:2], 'They covet fields and (then) steal them.' And if the owner approaches him with a view to reclaiming his money or preventing the theft, then he will come to murder. Go and learn from the example of Achav [Ahab] and Navot [Naboth].| Maimonides&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Hilkhot Gezeila Va-aveida 1:11, See: http://www.vbm-torah.org/parsha.63/17yitro.htm &lt;/ref&gt;}}
Maimonides’ admonition to learn from the example of Ahab and Naboth refers to the narrative in 1 Kings 21 in which King Ahab of Israel tried to convince Naboth the Jezreelite to sell him the vineyard Naboth owned adjacent to the king’s palace.  Ahab wanted the land to use as a vegetable garden, but Naboth refused to sell or trade the property to Ahab saying, “The LORD forbid that I should give up to you what I have inherited from my fathers!”&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 21:4 (JPS)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ahab’s wife Jezebel then conspired to obtain the vineyard by writing letters in Ahab’s name to the elders and nobles in Naboth’s town instructing them to have two scoundrels bear false witness claiming that Naboth has cursed both God and the king.  After Naboth was subsequently stoned to death, Ahab seized possession of Naboth’s vineyard.  The text describes the LORD as very angry with Ahab, and the prophet Elijah pronounces judgment on both Ahab and Jezebel.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 21:20-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Jewish views portray the prohibition of coveting as having its own fundamental and independent significance apart from the other nine commandments.  For example, the Bava Batra teach that a person can even harm his neighbor with his eyes.  It asserts that damage caused by looking is also regarded as damage that is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt; The Tenth Commandment: &quot;You Shall Not Covet&quot; By Rav Elchanan Samet  http://www.vbm-torah.org/parsha.63/17yitro.htm  &lt;/ref&gt;  Even if the covetous desire is concealed in the heart, the covetous desire in itself is regarded by the Torah as damaging to the neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Cassuto’s Comments on Exodus 20:14, The Tenth Commandment: &quot;You Shall Not Covet&quot; By Rav Elchanan Samet  http://www.vbm-torah.org/parsha.63/17yitro.htm &lt;/ref&gt; 

Philo describes covetous desire as a kind of revolution and plotting against others, because the passions of the soul are formidable.   He regards desire as the worst kind of passion, but also one over which the individual exercises voluntary control.  Therefore, near the conclusion of his discourse on the Decalogue, Philo exhorts the individual to make use of this commandment to cut off desire, the fountain of all iniquity.&lt;ref&gt; Philo, A Treatise Concerning the Ten Commandments XXII http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Decalogue.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Left unchecked, covetous desire is the source of personal, interpersonal, and international strife.
{{quotation| Is the love of money, or of women, or of glory, or of any one of the other efficient causes of pleasure, the origin of slight and ordinary evils? Is it not owing to this passion that relationships are broken asunder, and change the good will which originates in nature into an irreconcilable enmity? And are not great countries and populous kingdoms made desolate by domestic seditions, through such causes? And are not earth and sea continually filled with novel and terrible calamities by naval battles and military expeditions for the same reason?| Philo &lt;ref&gt;Philo, A Treatise Concerning the Ten Commandments XXVIII http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Decalogue.html &lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ibn Ezra taught that a person can control his desires by training his heart to be content with that God has allotted to him. 
{{quotation| When he knows that God has forbidden his neighbor's wife to him, then she is more elevated in his eyes than the princess in the eyes of the peasant. And so he is satisfied with his portion and does not allow his heart to covet and desire something that is not his, for he knows that God does not wish to give it to him; he cannot take it by force or by his thoughts or schemes. He has faith in his Creator, that He will provide for him and do what is good in His eyes.| Ibn Ezra&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ezra, comments on “You shall not covet” http://www.vbm-torah.org/parsha.63/17yitro.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}
==New Testament view==
The Gospel of Luke describes Jesus' warning to guard one’s heart against covetousness.  &quot;Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Luke 12:15 ESV&lt;/ref&gt;  Jesus also describes the sins that defile a person as sins from coming from untamed desires in the heart.&lt;ref&gt;Mark 7:20-22&lt;/ref&gt;  The book of James portrays covetous desire residing in the heart as being the internal source of temptation and sin.&lt;ref&gt;James 1:13-15&lt;/ref&gt;  James goes on to describe how covetous desire leads to fighting and that lack of material possessions is caused by not asking God for them and by asking with wrong motives.
{{quotation| You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.| James 4:2-4&lt;ref&gt;James 4:2-4 ESV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The books of Ephesians and Colossians regard the sin of covetousness as a kind if idolatry and list this sin along with sexual immorality and impurity which give rise to the wrath of God.&lt;ref&gt;Ephesians 5:3-6, Colossians 3:5-6&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints. Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.| Ephesians 3:5-6&lt;ref&gt; Ephesians 3:5-6&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The New Testament stresses thanksgiving and contentment as proper heart attitudes that contrast covetousness.  John the Baptist exhorted soldiers to be content with their pay rather than extorting money by threats and false accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 3:14&lt;/ref&gt;   The book of Hebrews encourages one to keep his life free from the love of money and “be content with what you have” and depend on the promises and help of God rather than trusting  in wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 13:5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The book of 1 Timothy contains a classic warning against the love of money and stresses that it is great gain to be content with food and clothing.
{{quotation|Now there is great gain in godliness with contentment, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.  But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. | 1 Timothy 6:6-10&lt;ref&gt; 1 Timothy 6:6-10 ESV&lt;/ref&gt;}}


==Teaching of the Roman Catholic Church==
The Catholic Church considers the prohibition on coveting in Deuteronomy 5:21 and Exodus 20:17 to include two commandments, which are numbered the ninth and tenth commandments in Catholic teaching.  In the Catholic view, the ninth commandment is a prohibition on carnal concupiscence (or lust), and the tenth commandment prohibits greed and the setting of one’s heart on material possessions.

===Prohibition of carnal concupiscence (lust)===
A key point in the Catholic understanding of the ninth commandment is Jesus’ statement, “Every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, The Ninth Commandment, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm, Matthew 5:28&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an emphasis on the thoughts and attitudes of the heart as well as the promise that the pure in heart will both see God and be like him.

{{quotation|The sixth beatitude proclaims, &quot;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&quot; (Matthew 5:8) &quot;Pure in heart&quot; refers to those who have attuned their intellects and wills to the demands of God's holiness, chiefly in three areas: charity; (1 Timothy 4:3-9, 2 Timothy 2:22) chastity or sexual rectitude; (1 Thessalonians 4:7, Colossians 3:5, Ephesians 4:19) love of truth and orthodoxy of faith.( Titus 1:15, 1 Timothy 1:3-4, 2 Timothy 2:23-26 ) …The &quot;pure in heart&quot; are promised that they will see God face to face and be like him.( 1 Corinthians 13:12; 1 John 3:2) Purity of heart is the precondition of the vision of God. Even now it enables us to see according to God, to accept others as &quot;neighbors&quot;; it lets us perceive the human body - ours and our neighbor's - as a temple of the Holy Spirit, a manifestation of divine beauty. | Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2518-2519, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm &lt;/ref&gt;}}

While baptism confers upon the Christian purification of sins, the baptized must continue to struggle against disordered desires and the lust of the flesh.  By God’s grace he can prevail 1) by virtue of the gift of chastity which empowers love with a undivided and upright heart 2) by purity of intention which seeks to find and fulfill the will of God in everything 3) by purity of vision which disciplines the feelings and imagination and refuses complicity with impure thoughts, and  4) by prayer which looks to God for help against temptation and casts one’s cares upon God.&lt;ref&gt; Catechism of the Catholic Church 2518-2519, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

Adherence to the ninth commandment’s requirement of purity requires modesty, which protects the intimate center of the person.  Modesty refuses to unveil what should remain hidden.  Modesty is a servant of chastity and guides how one looks at others and behaves toward them in protective conformity with the dignity of the human person.  Modesty encourages patience and moderation in loving relationships, requiring that the conditions for the definitive giving and commitment of man and woman be fulfilled to one another.  It is a decency that inspires one’s clothing.  Modesty is discrete and avoids unhealthy curiosity.&lt;ref&gt; Catechism of the Catholic Church 2521-2522, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm &lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation| There is a modesty of the feelings as well as of the body. It protests, for example, against the voyeuristic explorations of the human body in certain advertisements, or against the solicitations of certain media that go too far in the exhibition of intimate things. Modesty inspires a way of life which makes it possible to resist the allurements of fashion and the pressures of prevailing ideologies. The forms taken by modesty vary from one culture to another. Everywhere, however, modesty exists as an intuition of the spiritual dignity proper to man. It is born with the awakening consciousness of being a subject. Teaching modesty to children and adolescents means awakening in them respect for the human person. | Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2523-2524, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm &lt;/ref&gt;}}
In addition to personal purity and modesty, the Catholic Church teaches that Christian purity requires a purification of the social climate. Communications media ought to demonstrate respect and restraint in their presentations which should be free from widespread eroticism and the inclination to voyeurism and illusion.  Moral permissiveness rests on a wrongheaded understanding of human freedom.  Education in the moral law is necessary for the development of true freedom.  Educators should be expected to give young people “instruction respectful of the truth, the qualities of the heart, and the moral and spiritual dignity of man.”&lt;ref&gt; Catechism of the Catholic Church 2525-2526, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

===Prohibition of greed and envy of possessions===
Catholic teaching on the prohibition of greed and envy center around Christ’s admonishments to desire and store up treasure in heaven rather than on earth, “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, The Tenth Commandment, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a0.htm , Matthew 6:21&lt;/ref&gt; The tenth commandment is regarded as completing and unfolding the ninth.   The tenth commandment forbids coveting the goods of another, as the root of the stealing and fraud forbidden by the commandment, “You shall not steal.”  &quot;Lust of the eyes&quot; leads to the violence and injustice forbidden by the commandment, “You shall not murder.” Covetousness, like sexual immorality, originates in the idolatry prohibited by the first three commandments.  The tenth commandment summarizes the entire law, by focusing on the intentions and desires of the heart.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2534 http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a0.htm &lt;/ref&gt;
Covetous desires create disorder because they move beyond satisfying basic human needs and “exceed the limits of reason and drive us to covet unjustly what is not ours and belongs to another or is owed to him.”&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2535 http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a0.htm &lt;/ref&gt;  Greed and the desire to amass earthy goods without limit are forbidden.  Avarice and passion for riches and power are forbidden.  “You shall not covet” means that we should banish our desires for whatever does not belong to us.  Never having enough money is regarded as a symptom of the love of money.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2536 http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a0.htm &lt;/ref&gt;   Obedience to the tenth commandment requires that envy be banished from the human heart.  Envy is a capital sin that includes sadness at the sight of another’s goods and the immoderate desire to acquire them for oneself. The baptized person should resist envy by practicing good will and rejoicing and praising God for material blessings granted to neighbor and brother.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2538-2540 http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a0.htm &lt;/ref&gt; 
God warns man away from what seems &quot;good for food . . . a delight to the eyes . . . to be desired to make one wise,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gensesis 3:6&lt;/ref&gt; and law and grace turn men’s hearts away from avarice and envy and toward the Holy Spirit who satisfies man’s heart. &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2541 http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a0.htm &lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation| “But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe.&quot;(Romans 3:21-22) Henceforth, Christ's faithful &quot;have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires&quot;; they are led by the Spirit and follow the desires of the Spirit.”(Galatians 5:24, cf. Romans 8:14, 27) | Catechism of the Catholic Church&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2543, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm &lt;/ref&gt;}}
Catholic teaching reminds that Jesus enjoins his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone, and bids them &quot;renounce all that [they have]&quot; for his sake and that of the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 14:33&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus gave his disciples the example of the poor widow of Jerusalem who gave out of her poverty all that she had to live on.&lt;ref&gt;Luke 21:4&lt;/ref&gt;  Detachment from riches is portrayed as obligatory for entrance into the Kingdom of heaven. &lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church 2544, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm &lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Blessed are the poor in spirit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew 5:3&lt;/ref&gt;  represents the expectation that those who do not receive all their physical longings are more inclined to seek fulfillment of their spiritual longings through Jesus Christ.  “The Lord grieves over the rich, because they find their consolation in the abundance of goods.”&lt;ref&gt; Catechism of the Catholic Church 2547, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm &lt;/ref&gt; 
&quot;I want to see God&quot; expresses the true desire of man. The water of eternal life quenches the thirst for God.&lt;ref&gt; Catechism of the Catholic Church 2557, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm John 14:14&lt;/ref&gt;  Attachment to the goods of this world are a bondage.  The Scriptural remedy is the desire for true happiness that is found in seeking and finding God.  Holy people must struggle, with grace from on high, to obtain the good things God promises.  Christ’s faithful put to death their cravings and, with the grace of God, prevail over the seductions of pleasure and power.&lt;ref&gt; Catechism of the Catholic Church 2548-2550, http://www.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a9.htm 2548-2550&lt;/ref&gt;   For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet lose his own soul?&lt;ref&gt;Mark 8:36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reformation and Post-Reformation views==
Martin Luther views sinful human nature such that no person naturally desires to see others with as much as oneself, each acquiring as much as he can while pretending to be pious.  The human heart, Luther says, is deceitful, knowing how to adorn oneself finely while concealing one’s rascality.

{{quotation| For we are so inclined by nature that no one desires to see another have as much as himself, and each one acquires as much as he can; the other may fare as best he can. And yet we pretend to be godly, know how to adorn ourselves most finely and conceal our rascality, resort to and invent adroit devices and deceitful artifices (such as now are daily most ingeniously contrived) as though they were derived from the law codes; yea, we even dare impertinently to refer to it, and boast of it, and will not have it called rascality, but shrewdness and caution. In this lawyers and jurists assist, who twist and stretch the law to suit it to their cause, stress words and use them for a subterfuge, irrespective of equity or their neighbor's necessity. And, in short, whoever is the most expert and cunning in these affairs finds most help in law, as they themselves say: Vigilantibus iura subveniunt [that is, The laws favor the watchful].| Martin Luther, The Large Catechism&lt;ref&gt;The Large Catechism by Martin Luther, Translated by F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau Published in: Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921) pp. 565-773 http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/catechism/web/cat-08.html&lt;/ref&gt;   }}

Luther further explains that the tenth commandment is not intended for the rogues of the world, but for the pious, who wish to be praised and considered as honest and upright people, because they have not broken any of the outward commandments.  Luther sees covetousness in the quarreling and wrangling in court over inheritances and real estate.  He sees covetousness in financiering practiced in a manner to obtain houses, castles, and land through foreclosure.  Likewise, Luther sees the tenth commandment as forbidding contrivances to take another man’s wife as one’s own and uses the example of King Herod taking his brother’s wife while his brother was still living.&lt;ref&gt;Mark 6:17-20&lt;/ref&gt;   
{{quotation| In whatever way such things happen, we must know that God does not wish that you deprive your neighbor of anything that belongs to him so that he suffer the loss and you gratify your avarice with it, even if you could keep it honorably before the world; for it is a secret and insidious imposition practised under the hat, as we say, that it may not be observed. For although you go your way as if you had done no one any wrong, you have nevertheless injured your neighbor; and if it is not called stealing and cheating, yet it is called coveting your neighbor's property, that is, aiming at possession of it, enticing it away from him without his will, and being unwilling to see him enjoy what God has granted him.| Martin Luther, The Large Catechism&lt;ref&gt;The Large Catechism by Martin Luther, Translated by F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau Published in: Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church (St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921) pp. 565-773 http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/luther/catechism/web/cat-08.html&lt;/ref&gt;   }}

John Calvin views the tenth commandment as a demand for purity of the heart, above and beyond the outward actions.  Calvin distinguishes between making an explicit design to obtain what belongs to our neighbor and a covetous desire in the heart.  For Calvin, design is a deliberate consent of the will, after passion has taken possession of the mind.  Covetousness may exist without such a deliberate design, when the mind is stimulated and tickled by objects on which we set our affection. &lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 49  http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#fortynin.htm &lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation| As, therefore, the Lord previously ordered that charity should regulate our wishes, studies, and actions, so he now orders us to regulate the thoughts of the mind in the same way, that none of them may be depraved and distorted, so as to give the mind a contrary bent. Having forbidden us to turn and incline our mind to wrath, hatred, adultery, theft, and falsehood, he now forbids us to give our thoughts the same direction.|John Calvin&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 49  http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#fortynin.htm &lt;/ref&gt;}}

In explaining the prohibition on covetousness, Calvin views the mind as either being filled with charitable thoughts toward one’s brother and neighbor, or being inclined toward covetous desires and designs.  The mind wholly imbued with charity has no room for carnal desires.  Calvin recognizes that all sorts of fancies rise up in the mind, and he exhorts the individual to exercise choice and discipline to shifting one’s thoughts away from fleshly desires and passions.  Calvin asserts that God’s intention in the command is to prohibit every kind of perverse desire. &lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, Book Two, Chapter 8, Section 50  http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/calvin/bk2ch08.html#fifty.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Henry sees the tenth commandment striking at the root of many sins by forbidding all desire that may yield injury to one’s neighbor.  The language of discontent and envy are forbidden in the heart and mind.  The appetites and desires of the corrupt nature are proscribed, and all are enjoined to see our face in the reflection of this law and to submit our hearts under the government of it. &lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry’s Commentary on Exodus 20:16 http://godstenlaws.com/ten-commandments/mh-commentary10.html &lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|The foregoing commands implicitly forbid all desire of doing that which will be an injury to our neighbour; this forbids all inordinate desire of having that which will be a gratification to ourselves. &quot;O that such a man’s house were mine! Such a man’s wife mine! Such a man’s estate mine!’’ This is certainly the language of discontent at our own lot, and envy at our neighbour’s; and these are the sins principally forbidden here.
St. Paul, when the grace of God caused the scales to fall from his eyes, perceived that this law, Thou shalt not covet, forbade all those irregular appetites and desires which are the first-born of the corrupt nature, the first risings of the sin that dwelleth in us, and the beginnings of all the sin that is committed by us: this is that lust which, he says, he had not known the evil of, if this commandment, when it came to his conscience in the power of it, had not shown it to him, Rom. 7:7.|Matthew Henry&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Henry’s Commentary on Exodus 20:16 http://godstenlaws.com/ten-commandments/mh-commentary10.html &lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Safety==

===Safety Class===

Choose a fitting safety class for this description

*'''Too dangerous!''' (We do not make this experiment because …)

*Very dangerous (Should only be attempted after careful training)

*Dangerous - Please be aware of this or the other thing... (Untrained people can do this experiment under supervision and guidance)

*Harmless (The most dangerous thing is this insignificant little petitesse)


===Required Safety Equipment===

*The show performer: Glasses / Lab coat / Nothing / Fire extinguisher / Wet towel and a bucket of water / Eye flushing bottle

*Audience/participants: Safety screens / Hearing protection (a finger in the ear is often a help).


==Materials==


You'll need the following - make a list

* item 1: formula, CAS number, supplier [http://www.someshop.com], Safety issues (describe the most important ones), Storage, link to safety datasheet

==Procedure==

Preparation time, Performance time, Clean-up time.

===Step by step===

#Start by…

#…

#End with explaining how to properly get rid of waste products


===Alternative methods===

Other ways to do the experiment


===Dangers===

Now the reader knows the experiment, give a closer description of possible dangers.

*Important, be aware of…

*Consider the…


===Other Factors===

What other things can sometimes affect the result of the experiment. Maybe the humidity or cleanliness of the glass ware is an issue.

===Show notes===

What to consider when preparing. How to make it more spectacular. What can be difficult to achieve 'on stage' that normally is easy when practising.

What other experiments are good to that have in relation to this one?

What should you beware of that can make the experiment boring?

==Explanation==

===What's taking place===

Here you can give a more quantitative and mathematical description of what happens. What fundamental laws are involved or demonstrated by this experiment etc. Remember to explain jargon/expressions from the laboratory.

===In the real world===

Do you meet things like this in daily life - give examples!

===Uanswered Questions===

Things we do not yet know and should find an answer to - maybe how it actually works etc.


===More Information===

*[http://end.net| Websites with more info] the end.

==Remember==

This is just a guide and it can contain both errors and omissions. Always make experiments in small versions before proceeding to larger quantities where things could become dangerous. Ask around if you have any doubts before starting and do not start on a procedure you do not feel you understand and is qualified to perform.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Common Lisp provides two different ways of looking at time: universal time, meaning time in the &quot;real world&quot;, and run time, meaning time as seen by your computer's CPU. We will deal with both of them separately.


== Universal Time ==

Universal time is represented as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00 of January 1, 1900 in the GMT time zone. The function GET-UNIVERSAL-TIME returns the current universal time:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (get-universal-time)
3220993326
&lt;/pre&gt;

Of course this value is not very readable, so you can use the function DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME to turn it into a &quot;calendar time&quot; representation:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (decode-universal-time 3220993326)
6
22
19
25
1
2002
4
NIL
5
&lt;/pre&gt;

This call returns nine values: seconds, minutes, hours, day, month, year, day of the week, daylight savings time flag and time zone. Note that the day of the week is represented as an integer in the range 0..6 with 0 being Monday and 6 being Sunday. Also, the time zone is represented as the number of hours you need to add to the current time in order to get GMT time. So in this example the decoded time would be 19:22:06 of Friday, January 25, 2002, in the EST time zone, with no daylight savings in effect. This, of course, relies on the computer's own clock, so make sure that it is set correctly (including the time zone you are in and the DST flag). As a shortcut, you can use GET-DECODED-TIME to get the calendar time representation of the current time directly:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (get-decoded-time)
&lt;/pre&gt;

is equivalent to

&lt;pre&gt;
* (decode-universal-time (get-universal-time))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is an example of how to use these functions in a program:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defconstant *day-names*
    '(&quot;Monday&quot; &quot;Tuesday&quot; &quot;Wednesday&quot;
      &quot;Thursday&quot; &quot;Friday&quot; &quot;Saturday&quot;
      &quot;Sunday&quot;))
*DAY-NAMES*

* (multiple-value-bind
	(second minute hour date month year day-of-week dst-p tz)
	(get-decoded-time)
    (format t &quot;It is now ~2,'0d:~2,'0d:~2,'0d of ~a, ~d/~2,'0d/~d (GMT~@d)&quot;
	      hour
	      minute
	      second
	      (nth day-of-week *day-names*)
	      month
	      date
	      year
	      (- tz)))
It is now 17:07:17 of Saturday, 1/26/2002 (GMT-5)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Of course the call to GET-DECODED-TIME above could be replaced by (DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME n), where n is any integer number, to print an arbitrary date. You can also go the other way around: the function ENCODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME lets you encode a calendar time into the corresponding universal time. This function takes six mandatory arguments (seconds, minutes, hours, date, month and year) and one optional argument (the time zone) and it returns a universal time:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (encode-universal-time 6 22 19 25 1 2002)
3220993326
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the result is automatically adjusted for daylight savings time if the time zone is not supplied. If it is supplied, than Lisp assumes that the specified time zone already accounts for daylight savings time, and no adjustment is performed.

Since universal times are simply numbers, they are easier and safer to manipulate than calendar times. Dates and times should always be stored as universal times if possible, and only converted to string representations for output purposes. For example, it is straightforward to know which of two dates came before the other, by simply comparing the two corresponding universal times with &lt;. Another typical problem is how to compute the &quot;temporal distance&quot; between two given dates. Let's see how to do this with an example: specifically, we will calculate the temporal distance between the first landing on the moon (4:17pm EDT, July 20 1969) and the last takeoff of the space shuttle Challenger (11:38 a.m. EST, January 28, 1986).

&lt;pre&gt;
* (setq *moon* (encode-universal-time 0 17 16 20 7 1969 4))
2194805820
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
* (setq *takeoff* (encode-universal-time 0 38 11 28 1 1986 5))
2716303080
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
* (- *takeoff* *moon*)
521497260
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's a bit over 52 million seconds, corresponding to 6035 days, 20 hours and 21 minutes (you can verify this by dividing that number by 60, 60 and 24 in succession). Going beyond days is a bit harder because months and years don't have a fixed length, but the above is approximately 16 and a half years.

You can in theory use differences between universal times to measure how long the execution of a part of your program took, but the universal times are represented in seconds, and this resolution will usually be too low to be useful. We will see a better method of doing this in the section about internal time.

To sum up, we have seen how to turn a universal time into a calendar time and vice-versa, how to perform calculations on universal times, and how to format calendar times in a human-readable way. The last piece that is missing is how to parse a string represented as a human-readable string (e.g. &quot;03/11/1997&quot;) and turn it into a calendar time. Unfortunately this turns out to be very difficult in the general case, due to the multitude of different ways of writing dates and times that we use. In some cases it might not even be possible without context information: the above example can be correctly parsed both as March 11th or as November 3rd according to where you are living. In conclusion, either force your users to write dates in a fixed format, or be prepared to write a very intelligent parsing function!

== Internal Time ==

Internal time is the time as measured by your Lisp environment, using your computer's clock. It differs from universal time in three important respects. First, internal time is not measured starting from a specified point in time: it could be measured from the instant you started your Lisp, from the instant you booted your machine, or from any other arbitrary time point in the past. As we will see shortly, the absolute value of an internal time is almost always meaningless; only differences between internal times are useful. The second difference is that internal time is not measured in seconds, but in a (usually smaller) unit whose value can be deduced from INTERNAL-TIME-UNITS-PER-SECOND:

&lt;pre&gt;
* internal-time-units-per-second
1000
&lt;/pre&gt;

This means that in the Lisp environment used in this example, internal time is measured in milliseconds. Finally, what is being measured by the &quot;internal time&quot; clock? There are actually two different internal time clocks in your Lisp: one of them meaures the passage of &quot;real&quot; time (the same time that universal time measures, but in different units), and the other one measures the passage of CPU time, that is, the time your CPU spends doing actual computation for the current Lisp process. On most modern computers these two times will be different, since your CPU will never be entirely dedicated to your program (even on single-user machines, the CPU has to devote part of its time to processing interrupts, performing I/O, etc.). The two functions used to retrieve internal times are called GET-INTERNAL-REAL-TIME and GET-INTERNAL-RUN-TIME respectively. Using them, we can solve the above problem about measuring a function's run time:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (let ((real1 (get-internal-real-time))
        (run1 (get-internal-run-time)))
    (... your call here ...)
    (let ((run2 (get-internal-run-time))
	    (real2 (get-internal-real-time)))
	(format t &quot;Computation took:~%&quot;)
	(format t &quot;  ~f seconds of real time~%&quot;
		(/ (- real2 real1) internal-time-units-per-second))
	(format t &quot;  ~f seconds of run time~%&quot;
		(/ (- run2 run1) internal-time-units-per-second))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

A good way to see the difference between real time and run time is to test the above code using a call such as (SLEEP 3). The SLEEP function suspends the execution of your code for the specified number of seconds. You should therefore see a real time very close to the argument of SLEEP and a run time very close to zero. Let's turn the above code into a macro in order to make it more general:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defmacro timing (&amp;body forms)
    (let ((real1 (gensym))
	    (real2 (gensym))
	    (run1 (gensym))
	    (run2 (gensym))
	    (result (gensym)))
    `(let* ((,real1 (get-internal-real-time))
	      (,run1 (get-internal-run-time))
	      (,result (progn ,@forms))
	      (,run2 (get-internal-run-time))
	      (,real2 (get-internal-real-time)))
	 (format *debug-io* &quot;;;; Computation took:~%&quot;)
	 (format *debug-io* &quot;;;;  ~f seconds of real time~%&quot;
		 (/ (- ,real2 ,real1) internal-time-units-per-second))
	 (format t &quot;;;;  ~f seconds of run time~%&quot;
		 (/ (- ,run2 ,run1) internal-time-units-per-second))
	 ,result)))
TIMING

* (timing (sleep 1))
;;; Computation took: 0.994 seconds of real time 0.0 seconds of run
;;; time
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

The built-in macro TIME does roughly the same as the above macro (it executes a form and prints timing information at the end), but it also usually provides information about memory usage, time spent in garbage collection, page faults, etc. The format of the output is implementation-dependent, but in general it's pretty useful and informative. This is an example under Allegro Common Lisp 6.0: we generate a list of 100 real numbers and we measure the time it takes to sort them in ascending order.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (let ((numbers (loop for i from 1 to 100 collect (random 1.0))))
    (time (sort numbers #'&lt;)))
; cpu time (non-gc) 0 msec user, 10 msec system
; cpu time (gc)     0 msec user, 0 msec system
; cpu time (total)  0 msec user, 10 msec system
; real time  9 msec
; space allocation:
;  3,586 cons cells, 11,704 other bytes, 0 static bytes
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Computing the day of the week ==

In the section about Universal Time we've learned enough to write a small function that computes the day of the week. Unfortunately, by definition, this function won't work for dates before January 1, 1900.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defun day-of-week (day month year)
    &quot;Returns the day of the week as an integer.
Monday is 0.&quot;
    (nth-value
     6
     (decode-universal-time
      (encode-universal-time 0 0 0 day month year 0)
      0)))
DAY-OF-WEEK
* (day-of-week 23 12 1965)
3
* (day-of-week 1 1 1900)
0
* (day-of-week 31 12 1899)

Type-error in KERNEL::OBJECT-NOT-TYPE-ERROR-HANDLER:
   1899 is not of type (OR (MOD 100) (INTEGER 1900))
&lt;/pre&gt;

If this is a problem for you, here's a small function by Gerald Doussot (adapted from the comp.lang.c FAQ) that will help you:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun day-of-week (day month year)
  &quot;Returns the day of the week as an integer.
Sunday is 0. Works for years after 1752.&quot;
  (let ((offset '(0 3 2 5 0 3 5 1 4 6 2 4)))
    (when (&lt; month 3)

'''Important: Always make the domain after you have already made the fluid and everything else. Subsurf the object that you are currently working on before you create any other object except the domain.'''

== Water and Other Fluids ==
Water is without a doubt one of the most important compounds in our lives; it covers about 75% of the earth and is therefore incredibly important in quite a few blender animations.  Wouldn't it be great if we could get an accurate physical representation of this liquid in blender?  We can, using a tool called Fluid Simulation.  This tool looks unnervingly complex at first glance, but this tutorial should clear it up for you.  At least to a basic level. ''(Sorry, but I'm not the best with this feature.  If anybody sees any missing information that you can help with, please don't be shy to contribute!)''

== The Domain ==
One can imagine how much time it would take Blender3D to think about everything in the infinite space of a 3d world in terms of fluid objects and deflection, so we obviously need to cut down on that size.  Create a fairly large cube.  This will eventually be set as the volume in which all of the fluid simulation occurs.  Don't make it too large, but not too small either.  With this cube selected, press &quot;F7&quot; to get to the physics screen.  Find the tab that says &quot;Fluid&quot;, and click the &quot;Fluid&quot; button to enable the function.  Of the six new buttons that appear, click &quot;Domain&quot;.  All the fluid physics will be calculated inside this cube.  Also in that tab, you'll see three buttons, &quot;Std&quot; (which will be pressed by default), &quot;Ad&quot;, and &quot;Bn&quot;.  Each one opens a different set of values.  These will be explained as they become important.

'''Noob note:'''
# The example animated GIF below uses a domain which consists of the standard cube scaled 10 times. RMB, SKEY, 10, ENTERKEY.
# The fluid can be set to be smaller than this. OBJECTMODE, add, mesh, cube, SKEY, 10, ENTERKEY. Reduce this second cube by half. EDITMODE, deselect all(AKEY), border select(BKEY) top vertices, pull down the vertices to half way.

== The Fluid ==
As a basic start up for your experiments with fluid simulation, I am going to take you through a small demo in which we drop an object into a pool of water, creating a splash.  To do this, we need a fluid object and an obstacle object.  For the fluid, create another cube, scaled down to cover the bottom of your domain.  Enable this object in fluid simulation also and select &quot;fluid&quot;.  When we start to bake the fluids, this will be set up as your liquid. Make sure you bake this animation COMPLETELY before you add the obstacle. (Don't bake it yet, this will be better explained in the Baking Fluids section)

Let us go over what you have now. You have your starting cube, with the &quot;Fluid Simulation&quot; and &quot;Domain&quot; buttons depressed, and will be referred to as &quot;Domain&quot;. Inside this is the cube that covers the bottom of your Domain , which is the liquid. The liquid will be a different object with the &quot;Fluid Simulation&quot; and the &quot;Fluid&quot; button depressed. Create a third object which we will call &quot;Obstacle&quot;. This will be the object dropped into the water, and will be described further in the explanation.

== The Obstacle==

http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/240/blenderfluidtut1.jpg

Now, create the object you want to drop into the water.  Give it an IPO/Animation to drop into the water, and enable it as--you guessed it--an obstacle (click the &quot;fluid&quot; button, click &quot;obstacle&quot;).  

(User Note: We were just told to bake the animation &quot;COMPLETELY&quot; &quot;before&quot; adding the obstacle, but the baking instructions come in the next section.  Are we supposed to bake the animation and then add the obstacle, as it says, or add the obstacle and THEN bake the animation as the sequence of instructions indicates??  *Could anyone out there clean this up a bit?*)

(User Note: He said when you bake it its important to bake the fluid before the obstacle, you are not supposed to bake it until Baking Fluids Step.)

Set up the animation in the front/side views, not the top view. The z-axis is where gravity works. No baking required at this stage. othman

== Baking Fluids ==
Now we get to see what it all looks like.  Before we do anything too fancy, however, go to the render buttons (F10) and specify the total number of frames to simulate the fluid in.  Most projects don't need the whole 250 frames.  Select the domain object, and find the big button that says &quot;BAKE&quot; under its fluid simulation panel.  Press it, click the &quot;continue&quot; part of what comes up, and watch your masterpiece evolve.  Be patient, blender has to render this simulation just like it would render the final product.  The frame count of this rendering replaces the bar at the top of the screen where it says, &quot;www.blender.org&quot; with the blender logo.  If at any time you feel that you want to abort this process, press &quot;Esc&quot;. Once the bake is finished, open a timeline window and press play. There, you should be able to view the full simulation.

(note: Make sure the bake data is being sent somewhere or the time you spent waiting will have been for nothing!!)

(User edit: Specify a folder in the space at the bottom for blender to keep the temporal data. Else it will not work)
(Note on user edit:  When I specify a name and folder, the water animation disappears.  ???)

(Yet another User: I tried to Bake my animation, but all it says is something about no images to bake to. I know I need to set a folder or something, but have no idea how!)
(You'll get that is you're still in the &quot;Render Options&quot;, make sure to go back to the Domain object's &quot;Physics&quot; buttons.)

'''Noob note:'''
# As mentioned above, the baking does not work in the render options panel.
object mode, select domain, physics, fluid, bake
# Water splash can be observed with 12 frames only.
# Convert the output of the animation using gimp. Open all files as layers then save as gif.
# Convert into video using Blender's video sequencer. Refer to Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using the sequencer to compile frames into an animation

== Other Fluid Objects ==
There are two other incredibly useful types of fluid objects--&quot;inflow&quot; and &quot;outflow&quot;.  The both of these do exactly what they sound like.  Inflow objects pour more fluid into the scene, and outflow objects drain it away.

== Keep This In Mind ==
Blender will make your water its default opaque grey unless you set its color.  A good way to make realistic, clear water (as well as glass for that matter) is to edit the color, then apply a simple mirror effect plus transparency effect.  After your water has rendered, select the domain in object mode.  This selects the liquid in the frame you have just added. From shading [F5] then the 'Materials buttons' (the button that resembles a ball, if when you click on this the colors settings are not up, just press add new under the only panel there), then the panel called &quot;shaders/Mirror transplants/SSS&quot;.  Go to the Mirror transplants panel, play around with the settings until you get what you fancy. Suitable settings include [the 'Mirror trans' panel of Material:] click 'ray mirror', set rayMir to 0.1 for water, 0.15 for glass, set depth to 7; click 'ray Transp', set IOR to 1.3 for water, 1.5 for glass; then set the Alpha value to 0 while adding an appropriate color from the &quot;Material&quot; panel.

== Notes == 
This tutorial was just a simple example that leaves much to be desired.
Below are some helpful links that will further your understanding of the fluid
simulator.

==Safety==

===Safety Class===

Choose a fitting safety class for this description

*'''Too dangerous!''' (We do not make this experiment because …)

*Very dangerous (Should only be attempted after careful training)

*Dangerous - Please be aware of this or the other thing... (Untrained people can do this experiment under supervision and guidance)

*Harmless (The most dangerous thing is this insignificant little petitesse)


===Required Safety Equipment===

*The show performer: Glasses / Lab coat / Nothing / Fire extinguisher / Wet towel and a bucket of water / Eye flushing bottle

*Audience/participants: Safety screens / Hearing protection (a finger in the ear is often a help).


==Materials==


You'll need the following - make a list

* item 1: formula, CAS number, supplier [http://www.someshop.com], Safety issues (describe the most important ones), Storage, link to safety datasheet

==Procedure==

Preparation time, Performance time, Clean-up time.

===Step by step===

#Start by…

#…

#End with explaining how to properly get rid of waste products


===Alternative methods===

Other ways to do the experiment


===Dangers===

Now the reader knows the experiment, give a closer description of possible dangers.

*Important, be aware of…

*Consider the…


===Other Factors===

What other things can sometimes affect the result of the experiment. Maybe the humidity or cleanliness of the glass ware is an issue.

===Show notes===

What to consider when preparing. How to make it more spectacular. What can be difficult to achieve 'on stage' that normally is easy when practising.

What other experiments are good to that have in relation to this one?

What should you beware of that can make the experiment boring?

==Explanation==

===What's taking place===

Here you can give a more quantitative and mathematical description of what happens. What fundamental laws are involved or demonstrated by this experiment etc. Remember to explain jargon/expressions from the laboratory.

===In the real world===

Do you meet things like this in daily life - give examples!

===Unanswered Questions===

Things we do not yet know and should find an answer to - maybe how it actually works etc.

===More Information===

*[http://end.net| Websites with more info] the end.

==Remember==

This is just a guide and it can contain both errors and omissions. Always make experiments in small versions before proceeding to larger quantities where things could become dangerous. Ask around if you have any doubts before starting and do not start on a procedure you do not feel you understand and is qualified to perform.

Choose a fitting safety class for this description

*'''Too dangerous!''' (We do not make this experiment because …)

*Very dangerous (Should only be attempted after careful training)

*Dangerous - Please be aware of this or the other thing... (Untrained people can do this experiment under supervision and guidance)

*Harmless (The most dangerous thing is this insignificant little petitesse)


===Required Safety Equipment===

*The show performer: Glasses / Lab coat / Nothing / Fire extinguisher / Wet towel and a bucket of water / Eye flushing bottle

*Audience/participants: Safety screens / Hearing protection (a finger in the ear is often a help).


==Materials==


You'll need the following - make a list

* item 1: formula, CAS number, supplier [http://www.someshop.com], Safety issues (describe the most important ones), Storage, link to safety datasheet

==Procedure==

Preparation time, Performance time, Clean-up time.

===Step by step===

#Start by…

#…

#End with explaining how to properly get rid of waste products


===Alternative methods===

Other ways to do the experiment


===Dangers===

Now the reader knows the experiment, give a closer description of possible dangers.

*Important, be aware of…

*Consider the…


===Other Factors===

What other things can sometimes affect the result of the experiment. Maybe the humidity or cleanliness of the glass ware is an issue.

===Show notes===

What to consider when preparing. How to make it more spectacular. What can be difficult to achieve 'on stage' that normally is easy when practising.

What other experiments are good to that have in relation to this one?

What should you beware of that can make the experiment boring?

==Explanation==

===What's taking place===

Here you can give a more quantitative and mathematical description of what happens. What fundamental laws are involved or demonstrated by this experiment etc. Remember to explain jargon/expressions from the laboratory.

What to consider when preparing. How to make it more spectacular. What can be difficult to achieve 'on stage' that normally is easy when practising.

What other experiments are good to that have in relation to this one?

What should you beware of that can make the experiment boring?

==Explanation==

===What's taking place===

Here you can give a more quantitative and mathematical description of what happens. What fundamental laws are involved or demonstrated by this experiment etc. Remember to explain jargon/expressions from the laboratory.

===In the real world===

Do you meet things like this in daily life - give examples!
E.g. Promession[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promession]
(Cryo-burial, an eco-burial)

===Unanswered Questions===

Things we do not yet know and should find an answer to - maybe how it actually works etc.

==Remember==

This is just a guide and it can contain both errors and omissions. Always make experiments in small versions before proceeding to larger quantities where things could become dangerous. Ask around if you have any doubts before starting and do not start on a procedure you do not feel you understand and is qualified to perform.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Comments on existing material on the page=


=Brainstorm=

This section contain ideas we are working on - Please add comments and ideas!

==Wettability==
*Nanotubes on a wafer for extreme hydrophobic demonstration
*TiO thin film with variable wettability and catalytic effect under UV exposure
*Soap film in lung tissue to keep it from collapsing - can this be demonstrated somehow? Collapsing sol gels?
*oil thin film calms troubled waters in a dish [http://www.leelanau.com/waterfall/oil.html]
[http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg18725105.200-how-oil-on-troubled-waters-calms-storms.html]
*[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/LightOptics/ThinFilmInterference/ThinFilmInterference.html oil thin films]
[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985STIN...8623880N maybe using a hairdryer to make the waves...]
*Capillary tubes of glass and plastic - see how far coloured water and soap water is sucked into the two (very little in the plastic tube)
*lotus effect [http://lotus-shower.isunet.edu/the_lotus_effect.htm]
*Superhydrophobic clothes and coatings

==Sticktion and adhesion==
*see also the Wettability experiments
*Bring a gecko
*Lotus leaf
*Potatoflour in water…can we do it with silica polishing particles, i guess we can…
*the opposite effect [http://sci-toys.com/scitoys/scitoys/magnets/magnets.html#rheological magneto rheological fluid]
*Electrostatic surface forces: 
**polystyrene 'flamingo' balls on a glass plate and an anti static gun.
** How does antistatic window cleaner work (is that what ammonia helps on in it?)

==Light scattering==
*Mini disk and Cd-rom and the variable density of dots.
*PDMS with silver nanoparticles in arrays for variable scattering – compare to opals
*Butterfly wings and beetle shells, birds feathers, oyster shells - and how about certain porcelains and jade?
*Wool becomes transparent in Benzyl Acohol (Cas No 100-51-6) which is a fairly harmless industrial solvent because it matches the index of refraction of the wool fibers -and what about paper?
*Tyndall rayleigh scattering experiment in milk or sulfur nanoparticles. White when they get too big (Mie vs Rayleigh).
*Compare a slowly grown transparent sodium acetate crystal with an opaque quickly grown one. A supersaturated solution of sodium acetate can be made by dissolving 50g sodium acetate trihydrate (CAS 6131-90-4 , Sigma aldrich prod no 71193-1KG) in 5 mL of water while heating. Then leave it to cool very slowly without disturbances - and you probably will have to make a fresh solution for each time since small dust particles after use will provide nucleation centers that start the crystallization during cooling. Once its cold, you can pour the solution out on a table and it will crystallize instantly to a warm rod stasing up like a stalagmite. The heat comes from the crystallization process and is used in hand warmers (where a small metal plate is included in the bag with the solution that can make a distubing 'click' to start the crystallization process).

==Carbon==
*Levitation of diamagnetic carbon over magnets
*Actuating nanotube films in water?
*Your pencil with the soft carbon. Pyrolithic graphite, the hard, diamond the harder, nanotubes tha hardest.
*Just for fun - how small can you write with a pen?
*Something about carbon black?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bulgaria''' is a country in south eastern Europe.  It shares borders with [[../Turkey|Turkey]], [[../Greece|Greece]], [[../Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[../Serbia|Serbia]] and [[../Romania|Romania]]. The capital city is '''[[w:Sofia|Sofia]]'''.  Other big cities are Plovdiv and Varna.  Bulgaria joined the [[../EU|European Union]] on January 1st, 2007.  The currency of Bulgaria is the Lev.

==Bulgaria's History==
[[Image:Europe location BG.png|thumb|250px|right|Map showing the location of Bulgaria in Europe]]
In 1912 and 1913, Bulgaria became involved in the Balkan Wars, first entering into conflict alongside Greece, Serbia and Montenegro against the Ottoman Empire. The First Balkan War (1912-1913) proved a success for the Bulgarian army. The Second Balkan War (1913) put Bulgaria against Greece and Serbia, joined by Romania and Turkey. After its defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria lost a large amount of the territory that they had conquered in the first war. 

During World War I, Bulgaria found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers. Bulgaria became allied with the Axis Powers, although no Bulgarian soldiers participated in the war against the USSR. During World War II Nazi Germany allowed Bulgaria to occupy parts of Greece and of Yugoslavia. Bulgaria became one of only three countries (along with Finland and Denmark) that '''saved its entire Jewish population''' (around 50,000 people) from the Nazi camps by refusing to comply with an August 31, 1943 resolution.

In September 1944, the Soviet army entered Bulgaria, enabling the Bulgarian Communists (the Bulgarian Workers Party) to seize power and establish a communist state. In 1944, Bulgaria's forces turned against the country's former ally, Germany.  Communism ended in Bulgaria in 1989 and since then the country has been democratic and capitalist.  Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Fall of Communism|In 1989 communism ended in many countries including Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and others because of mass protests}}
[[Image:Flag of Bulgaria.svg|thumb|border|220px|The flag of Bulgaria.]]
==Bulgaria's Geography==
[[Image:CentralMarketHall-Sofia-C.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Old market hall, Sofia]]
The area of Bulgaria is 110,994 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (42,855 sq mi). It borders five other countries: Romania to the north (mostly along the River Danube), Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia to the west, and Greece and Turkey to the south. The Black Sea runs along most of the country to the east. It is a land of mountains, rivers, and rolling plains. More than two-thirds of the country is plains, plateaus, or hilly land.   The '''highest mountain is [[w:Rila|Rila]] at 2925 metres'''.

The coastal climate is moderated by the Black Sea, but strong winds and violent local storms are common during the winter. Winters along the Danube River are bitterly cold. Most of Bulgaria has a temperate climate, with cool and damp winters, very hot and dry summers. Average precipitation in Bulgaria is about 630 millimeters per year. Bulgaria is likely to experience earthquakes and landslides. Bulgaria is currently facing some environmental issues including water pollution, air pollution, and forest pollution in the form of acid rain.

==Bulgaria's People==
The population of Bulgaria is just over '''7.3 million'''. The official language is Bulgarian. More than 90 percent of the population speak it. [[Wikijunior:Languages/Turkish|Turkish]] is the largest minority language. Education is free and required for children from the ages of 7 through 14. Most of Bulgaria’s people belong to the [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Bulgarian Orthodox Church]]. Other religions that are practiced include Islam and Judaism.

Football has become by far the most popular sport in Bulgaria. Many Bulgarian fans closely follow the top Bulgarian league, the Bulgarian &quot;A&quot; Professional Football Group; as well as the leagues of other European countries. 

[[Image:Snow_Scene_at_Shipka_Pass_1.JPG|300px|thumb|left|Winter at Shipka Pass, Bulgaria.]]

==Bulgaria's Sights==
Bulgaria, a country with a historical and cultural heritage, and attractive natural landscapes, is one of the most visited tourist destinations in Europe. The country has historical cities and towns, summer beaches, and '''mountain ski resorts'''. In the northern-hemisphere winter, Samokov, Borovets, Bansko and Pamporovo become well-attended ski-resorts. Summer resorts exist on the Black Sea at Sozopol, Nessebur, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, Sveti Vlas, Albena, Saints Constantine and Helena and many others. Spa resorts such as Bankya, Hisarya, Sandanski, Velingrad, Varshets and many others attract visitors throughout the year. 

Bulgaria has started to become an attractive tourist destination because of the quality of the resorts and prices below those found in Western Europe.  Beach-resorts attract tourists from Germany, Russia, Scandinavia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The ski-resorts have become a favorite destination for British and Irish tourists.

There are 9 [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in Bulgaria which include the Madara Rider and the 	Ancient City of Nessebar.

'''Switzerland''' is a small country in western Europe.  It shares borders with [[../Germany|Germany]], [[../Austria|Austria]], [[../Italy|Italy]], [[../France|France]] and [[../Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]]. The capital city is '''[[w:Bern|Bern]]'''.  Other big cities are Geneva and Zurich.  Switzerland is not a member of the [[../EU|European Union]].  The currency of Switzerland is the ''Swiss Franc''.

==Switzerland's History==
[[Image:Flag_of_Switzerland.svg|thumb|230px|left|The flag of Switzerland.]]
Switzerland has a '''long history of neutrality''' — it has not been at war since 1815 — and hosts many international organizations, including the Red Cross, and the World Trade Organization. In 1920, Switzerland joined the League of Nations, and in 1963 the Council of Europe. Switzerland was not invaded during either of the World Wars. During World War II, the Germans planed on attacking Switzerland, but they never did.

[[Image:Ibergeregg sea of fog.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Canton of Schwyz,Switzerland]]
[[Image:Matterhorn-Wallis.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Sunset in the Swiss alps.]]

==Switzerland's Geography==
With an area of 41,285 square kilometres (15,940 sq mi), Switzerland is a relatively small country. The population is about 7.5 million. Switzerland is one of the '''most mountainous countries of Europe'''. More than 70 percent of its area is covered by the Alps.  Switzerland's highest mountain is [[w:Monte Rosa|Monte Rosa]] at 4,634 metres.

Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The winters in the mountains alternate with sun and snow, while the lower lands tend to be more cloudy and foggy in winter.

==Switzerland's People==
[[File:Convent_of_St_Gall.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Abbey of Saint Gall, St. Gallen, Switzerland]]
The population of Switzerland is just over 8 million. [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Roman Catholicism]] is the most practiced religion. Almost 45 percent of the population practices Roman Catholicism. [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Muslims]], Orthodox Christians, and [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Judaism|Judaism]] are other practiced religions. 

Switzerland is multilingual and has '''four national languages''': [[Wikijunior:Languages/German|German]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/French|French]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/Italian|Italian]] and Romansh. Other spoken languages are Spanish, Portuguese, and Turkish. Switzerland has a literacy rate of almost 100 percent. Education is required from ages 5 to 16 years of age.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|literacy rate|the percentage of adults in a country who can read and write}}

Like many European nations the Swiss are big fans of football and the national team is widely supported. Many Swiss also follow ice hockey. Over the last few years several Swiss tennis players, like Roger Federer and Martina Hingis, have been multiple Grand Slam singles champions. One of the world's best current ice skaters is Swiss Stéphane Lambiel. Switzerland is also the home of the successful sailing team Alinghi. Other sports where the Swiss have been successful include fencing, whitewater slalom, ice hockey, beach volleyball, and skiing.

==Switzerland's Sights==
Tourists are drawn to Switzerland's climate and landscapes, in particular for skiing and mountaineering.  Because of tax differences between Switzerland and neighbouring countries, Switzerland is popular for shopping trips.  Being a major world finance centre also brings in a lot of business travellers.

There are eleven [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] in Switzerland including: the [[w:Old City of Bern|Old City of Bern]], the Abbey of St. Gall and Monte San Giorgio.

'''Turkey''' is a large country in south eastern Europe and western Asia.  It shares borders with [[../Greece|Greece]], [[../Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[../Georgia|Georgia]], [[../Armenia|Armenia]], [[../Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] (Nakhichevan), Iraq, Iran and Syria. The capital city is '''[[w:Ankara|Ankara]]'''.  Other big cities are Istanbul and Izmir.  Turkey is not a member of the [[../EU|European Union]] but would like to become a member in the future.  The currency of Turkey is the '''New Turkish Lira'''.
[[Image:Flag_of_Turkey.svg|thumb|200px|right|The flag of Turkey.]]
==Turkey's History==
Turkey has a very long history and has been occupied by the Trojans, Greeks, Lydians, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuks, Ottomans, and now the modern day Turks.

Before 1923 Turkey controlled countries across south-eastern Europe, south-western Asia and northern Africa as the '''Ottoman Empire'''.  Today there are over 50 countries in Europe, Asia and Africa which were once part of the Ottoman Empire.

Turkey lost its empire and became an independent country in 1923.  Since World War 2 Turkey has been a close ally of most European countries and the USA.  Today the country is fairly prosperous, has good relations with its neighbours and hopes to become part of the European Union in the next few years.

==Turkey's Geography==

Asian Turkey (made up largely of Anatolia), which includes 97% of the country, is separated from European Turkey by the Bosporus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles (which together form a water link between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean). European Turkey (eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula) includes 3% of the country. The territory of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide, with a roughly rectangular shape. Turkey's area, including lakes, occupies 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 sq mi), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 sq mi) are in south west Asia and 23,764 square kilometres (9,174 sq mi) in Europe. Turkey's area makes it the '''world's 37th-largest country''', and is about the size of Metropolitan France and the United Kingdom combined. Turkey is encircled by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Turkey also contains the Sea of Marmara in the north west.

The European section of Turkey, in the north-west, is Eastern Thrace, and forms the borders of Turkey with Greece and Bulgaria. The Asian part of the country, Anatolia (also called Asia Minor), consists of a high central plateau with narrow coastal plains, between the Köroğlu and East-Black Sea mountain range to the north and the Taurus Mountains to the south. Eastern Turkey has a more mountainous landscape, and is home to the sources of rivers such as the Euphrates, Tigris and Aras, and contains Lake Van and '''[[w:Mount Ararat|Mount Ararat]], Turkey's highest point at 5,165 metres''' (16,946 ft).

Turkey is geographically divided into seven regions: Marmara, Aegean, Black Sea, Central Anatolia, Eastern Anatolia, south eastern Anatolia and the Mediterranean. The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt. This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area. As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.

Earthquakes are frequent and occasionally severe because most of the mountains were formed by volcanic activity. Turkey has cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers. 

==Turkey's People==
[[File:Cruise ship and Seabus in Istanbul.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ships in Istanbul]]
The '''population of Turkey is just under 77 million'''. It is the third largest European country by population (after Russia and Germany). Most of the population speaks [[Wikijunior:Languages/Turkish|Turkish]] which is the national language of Turkey. [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Islam]] is the major religion practised in Turkey, where nominally 99% of the Turkish population is Muslim. About 90 percent of the population lives in the Asian part of Turkey and about 10 percent lives in the European part.

The most popular sport in Turkey is football. Other sports such as basketball and volleyball are also popular. Surfing, snowboarding, skateboarding, paragliding and other extreme sports are becoming more popular every year. Another major sport in which the Turks have been internationally successful is weightlifting; as Turkish weightlifters, both male and female, have broken numerous world records and won several European, World and Olympic championship titles.


==Turkey's Sights==

'''Istanbul is the country's major tourist city''' and is famous for its mixture of European and Asian culture, architecture and lifestyle.  About 29 million tourists visit Turkey every year.  Apart from Istanbul, spa resorts, hiking and seaside resorts are popular with tourists.  Tourists in Turkey come from a wide range of countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, Iran and Japan.

There are '''10 [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]''' in Turkey which include the Historical Areas of Istanbul, the ancient city of '''Troy''' and the Great Mosque and hospital of Divrigi in the east of the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|class}}

The keyword {{C sharp|break}} is used to exit out of a loop or switch block.

; {{C sharp|break}} as used in a loop:
&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
int x;
 
while (x &lt; 20){

   if (x &gt; 10) break;

   x++;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The while loop would increment x as long as it was less than twenty. However when x is incremented to ten the condition in the if statement becomes true, so the break statement causes the while loop to be broken and execution would continue after the closing parentheses.

; {{C sharp|break}} as used in a switch block:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
int x;

switch (x)
    {
    case 0:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;x is 0&quot;);
        break;
    case 1:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;x is 1&quot;);
        break;
    case 2:
        // falls through
    case 3:
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;x is 2 or 3&quot;);
        break;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

When the program enters the switch block, it will search for a case statement that is true. Once it finds one, it will read any further statements printed until it finds a break statement. In the above example, if {{C sharp|x}} is 0 or 1, the console will only print their respective values and then jump out of the statement. However, if the value of {{C sharp|x}} is 2 ''or'' 3, the program will read the same proceeding statement(s) until it reaches a break statement. In order not to show anybody who reads the code that this handling for 2 is the same for three, it is good programming practice to add a comment like &quot;falls through&quot; after the falling-through cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Functions that return functions==

&quot;How do I write a function that returns a function?&quot; is a typical question asked by people who have learned Scheme before they started with Common Lisp. In Scheme, they were accustomed to be able to do things like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
==&gt; (define (adder n) (lambda (x) (+ x n)))
adder

==&gt; ((adder 3) 5)
8

==&gt; (define (doubler f) (lambda (x) (f x x)))
doubler

==&gt; ((doubler +) 4)
8
&lt;/pre&gt;

This can of course be done in Common Lisp, but the syntax and the semantics are different. The first step, creating a function that returns a function, looks very similar apart from minor syntactical conventions, but what happens behind the scenes is different:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defun adder (n)
    (lambda (x) (+ x n)))
ADDER
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here we have defined the function ADDER which returns an object of type [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/t_fn.htm FUNCTION]. To create such an object you'll have to use the special operator [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_fn.htm FUNCTION] and apply it to a lambda expression. (FUNCTION form) may be abbreviated as #'form. In our example above we used a shorthand notation provided by the macro [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_lambda.htm LAMBDA]. Without this little bit of syntactical sugar we would have to write it as

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defun adder (n)
    #'(lambda (x) (+ x n)))
ADDER
&lt;/pre&gt;

or

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defun adder (n)
    (function (lambda (x) (+ x n))))
ADDER
&lt;/pre&gt;

No matter how we write it, ADDER will now return a function whenever we call it. But we can't use it in the same way we would use it in Scheme:

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; continued from above
* (adder 3)
#&lt;Interpreted Function &quot;LAMBDA (N)&quot; {485FFE81}&gt;

* ((adder 3) 5)
In: (ADDER 3) 5
  ((ADDER 3) 5)
Error: Illegal function call.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is why: CL has different namespaces for functions and variables, i.e. the same name can refer to different things depending on its position in a form that's evaluated:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (boundp 'foo)
NIL
* (fboundp 'foo)
NIL
* (defparameter foo 42)
FOO
* foo
42
* (boundp 'foo)
T
* (fboundp 'foo)
NIL
* (defun foo (x) (* x x))
FOO
* (fboundp 'foo)
T
* foo            ;;; ***
42
* (foo 3)        ;;; +++
9
* (foo foo)
1764
* (function foo)
#&lt;Interpreted Function FOO {48523CC1}&gt;
* #'foo
#&lt;Interpreted Function FOO {48523CC1}&gt;
* (let ((+ 3))
    (+ + +))
6
&lt;/pre&gt;

To simplify a bit, you can think of each symbol in CL having (at least) two &quot;cells&quot; in which information is stored. One cell - sometimes referred to as its value cell - can hold a value that is bound to this symbol, and you can use [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_boundp.htm BOUNDP] to test whether the symbol is bound to a value (in the global environment). You can access the value cell of a symbol with [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_symb_5.htm SYMBOL-VALUE].

The other cell - sometimes referred to as its function cell - can hold the definition of the symbol's (global) function binding. In this case, the symbol is said to be fbound to this definition. You can use [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_fbound.htm FBOUNDP] to test whether a symbol is fbound. You can access the function cell of a symbol (in the global environment) with [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_symb_1.htm SYMBOL-FUNCTION].

Now, if a symbol is evaluated, it is treated as a variable in that it's value cell is returned - see the line marked with *** above. If a compound form, i.e. a cons, is evaluated and its car is a symbol, then the function cell of this symbol is used - see the line marked +++ above.

In Common Lisp, as opposed to Scheme, it is not possible that the car of the compound form to be evaluated is an arbitrary form. If it is not a symbol, it must be a lambda expression, which looks like

(lambda lambda-list form*)

This explains the error message we got above - (ADDER 3) is neither a symbol nor a lambda expression. But, you might ask, how do we use the function object that is returned by ADDER? The answer is: Use [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_funcal.htm FUNCALL] or [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_apply.htm APPLY]:

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; continued from above
* (funcall (adder 3) 5)
8
* (apply (adder 3) '(5))
8
* (defparameter *my-fun* (adder 3))
*MY-FUN*
* *my-fun*
#&lt;Interpreted Function &quot;LAMBDA (N)&quot; {486468C9}&gt;
* (funcall *my-fun* 5)
8
* (*my-fun* 5)
Warning: This function is undefined:
  *MY-FUN*
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that in the last example the function object returned by (ADDER 3) is stored in the value cell of *MY-FUN* - thus the error message. If we want to be able to use the symbol *MY-FUN* in the car of a compound form, we have to explicitely store something in its function cell (which is normally done for us by the macro [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defun.htm DEFUN]):

&lt;pre&gt;
;;; continued from above
* (fboundp '*my-fun*)
NIL
* (setf (symbol-function '*my-fun*) (adder 3))
#&lt;Interpreted Function &quot;LAMBDA (N)&quot; {4869FA19}&gt;
* (fboundp '*my-fun*)
T
* (*my-fun* 5)
8
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we are ready do define DOUBLER as well:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (defun doubler (f)
    (lambda (x) (funcall f x x)))
DOUBLER
* (doubler #'+)
#&lt;Interpreted Function &quot;LAMBDA (F)&quot; {48675791}&gt;
* (doubler '+)
#&lt;Interpreted Function &quot;LAMBDA (F)&quot; {486761B1}&gt;
* (funcall (doubler #'+) 4)
8
* (funcall (doubler '+) 4)
8
* (defparameter *my-plus* '+)
*MY-PLUS*
* (funcall (doubler *my-plus*) 4)
8
* (defparameter *my-fun* (doubler '+))
*MY-FUN*
* (funcall *my-fun* 4)
8
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the argument to FUNCALL (and APPLY) can either be the function itself, i.e. #'+, or a symbol which has the function in its function cell (is fbound to the function), i.e. '+.

All of the above is extremely simplified - we haven't even mentioned macros, special forms, symbol macros, self-evaluating objects, and lexical environments. Read the CLHS section about [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/03_aba.htm Form Evaluation] for the real deal.

==Currying functions==

A related concept is that of [http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~scott/pl/lectures/caml-intro.html#higherorder currying] which you might be familiar with if you're coming from a functional language. After we've read the last section that's rather easy to implement:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (declaim (ftype (function (function &amp;rest t) function) curry)
           (inline curry))
NIL
* (defun curry (function &amp;rest args)
    (lambda (&amp;rest more-args)
      (apply function (append args more-args))))
CURRY
* (funcall (curry #'+ 3) 5)
8
* (funcall (curry #'+ 3) 6)
9
* (setf (symbol-function 'power-of-ten) (curry #'expt 10))
#
* (power-of-ten 3)
1000
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the DECLAIM statement above is just a hint for the compiler so it can produce more efficient code if it so wishes. Leaving it out won't change the semantics of the function.

==Opening a File==

Common Lisp has [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_open.htm OPEN] and [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_close.htm CLOSE] functions which resemble the functions of the same denominator from other programming languages you're probably familiar with. However, it is almost always recommendable to use the macro [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_w_open.htm WITH-OPEN-FILE] instead. Not only will this macro open the file for you and close it when you're done, it'll also take care of it if your code leaves the body abnormally (such as by a use of [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/s_throw.htm THROW]). A typical use of WITH-OPEN-FILE looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
(with-open-file (str &lt;file-spec&gt;
                     :direction &lt;direction&gt;
                     :if-exists &lt;if-exists&gt;
                     :if-does-not-exist &lt;if-does-not-exist&gt;)
  &lt;your code here&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

* STR is a variable which'll be bound to the stream which is created by opening the file.
* &lt;file-spec&gt; will be a truename or a pathname.
* &lt;direction&gt; is usually :INPUT (meaning you want to read from the file), :OUTPUT (meaning you want to write to the file) or :IO (which is for reading and writing at the same time) - the default is :INPUT.
* &lt;if-exists&gt; specifies what to do if you want to open a file for writing and a file with that name already exists - this option is ignored if you just want to read from the file. The default is :ERROR which means that an error is signalled. Other useful options are :SUPERSEDE (meaning that the new file will replace the old one), NIL (the stream variable will be bound to NIL), and :RENAME (i.e. the old file is renamed).
* &lt;if-does-not-exist&gt; specifies what to do if the file you want to open does not exist. It is one of :ERROR for signalling an error, :CREATE for creating an empty file, or NIL for binding the stream variable to NIL. The default is, to be brief, to do the right thing depending on the other options you provided. See the CLHS for details. 

Note that there are a lot more options to WITH-OPEN-FILE. See the [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_open.htm CLHS entry for OPEN] for all the details. You'll find some examples on how to use WITH-OPEN-FILE below. Also note that you usually don't need to provide any keyword arguments if you just want to open an existing file for reading.

==Using Strings instead of Files==

==Reading a File one Line at a Time==

[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_lin.htm READ-LINE] will read one line from a stream (which defaults to [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_s.htm#standard_input standard input]) the end of which is determined by either a newline character or the end of the file. It will return this line as a string without the trailing newline character. (Note that READ-LINE has a second return value which is true if there was no trailing newline, i.e. if the line was terminated by the end of the file.) READ-LINE will by default signal an error if the end of the file is reached. You can inhibit this by supplying NIL as the second argument. If you do this, READ-LINE will return NIL if it reaches the end of the file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
&gt; (with-open-file (stream &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;)
    (do ((line (read-line stream nil)
               (read-line stream nil)))
        ((null line))
      (print line)))
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also supply a third argument which will be used instead of NIL to signal the end of the file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
&gt; (with-open-file (stream &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;)
    (loop for line = (read-line stream nil 'foo)
          until (eq line 'foo)
          do (print line)))
&lt;/source&gt;

==Reading a File one Character at a Time==

[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_cha.htm READ-CHAR] is similar to READ-LINE, but it only reads one character as opposed to one line. Of course, newline characters aren't treated differently from other characters by this function.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (with-open-file (stream &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;)
    (do ((char (read-char stream nil)
               (read-char stream nil)))
        ((null char))
      (print char)))
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Looking one Character ahead==

You can 'look at' the next character of a stream without actually removing it from there - this is what the function [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_peek_c.htm PEEK-CHAR] is for. It can be used for three different purposes depending on its first (optional) argument (the second one being the stream it reads from): If the first argument is NIL, PEEK-CHAR will just return the next character that's waiting on the stream:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (with-input-from-string (stream &quot;I'm not amused&quot;)
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (peek-char nil stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (values))

#\I 
#\' 
#\'
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the first argument is T, PEEK-CHAR will skip [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_w.htm#whitespace whitespace] characters, i.e. it will return the next non-whitespace character that's waiting on the stream. The whitespace characters will vanish from the stream as if they had been read by READ-CHAR:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (with-input-from-string (stream &quot;I'm 
                                   not amused&quot;)
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (peek-char t stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (values))
#\I 
#\' 
#\m 
#\n 
#\n 
#\o
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the first argument to PEEK-CHAR is a character, the function will skip all characters until that particular character is found:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (with-input-from-string (stream &quot;I'm not amused&quot;)
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (peek-char #\a stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (values))
#\I 
#\a 
#\a 
#\m 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that PEEK-CHAR has further optional arguments to control its behaviour on end-of-file similar to those for READ-LINE and READ-CHAR (and it will signal an error by default):

&lt;pre&gt;
* (with-input-from-string (stream &quot;I'm not amused&quot;)
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (peek-char #\d stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (peek-char nil stream nil 'the-end))
    (values))
#\I 
#\d 
#\d 
THE-END
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also put one character back onto the stream with the function [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_unrd_c.htm UNREAD-CHAR]. You can use it as if, after you have read a character, you decide that you'd better used PEEK-CHAR instead of READ-CHAR:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (with-input-from-string (stream &quot;I'm not amused&quot;)
    (let ((c (read-char stream)))
      (print c)
      (unread-char c stream)
      (print (read-char stream))
      (values)))
#\I 
#\I
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the front of a stream doesn't behave like a stack: You can only put back exactly one character onto the stream. Also, you must put back the same character that has been read previously, and you can't unread a character if none has been read before.

==Random Access to a File==

Use the function [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_file_p.htm FILE-POSITION] for random access to a file. If this function is used with one argument (a stream), it will return the current position within the stream. If it's used with two arguments (see below), it will actually change the [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_f.htm#file_position file position] in the stream.

&lt;pre&gt;
* (with-input-from-string (stream &quot;I'm not amused&quot;)
    (print (file-position stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (file-position stream))
    (file-position stream 4)
    (print (file-position stream))
    (print (read-char stream))
    (print (file-position stream))
    (values))
0 
#\I 
1 
4
#\n 
5
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Redirecting the Standard Output of your Program==

You do it like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
(let ((*standard-output* &lt;some form generating a stream&gt;))
  ...)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Because [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_debug_.htm *STANDARD-OUTPUT*] is a dynamic variable, all references to it during execution of the body of the LET form refer to the stream that you bound it to. After exiting the LET form, the old value of *STANDARD-OUTPUT* is restored, no matter if the exit was by normal execution, a RETURN-FROM leaving the whole function, an exception, or what-have-you. (This is, incidentally, why global variables lose much of their brokenness in Common Lisp compared to other languages: since they can be bound for the execution of a specific form without the risk of losing their former value after the form has finished, their use is quite safe; they act much like additional parameters that are passed to every function.)

If the output of the program should go to a file, you can do the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
(with-open-file (*standard-output* &quot;somefile.dat&quot; :direction :output
                                   :if-exists :supersede)
  ...)
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_w_open.htm WITH-OPEN-FILE] opens the file - creating it if necessary - binds *STANDARD-OUTPUT*, executes its body, closes the file, and restores *STANDARD-OUTPUT* to its former value. It doesn't get more comfortable than this!

==Faithful Output with Character Streams==

By faithful output I mean that characters with codes between 0 and 255 will be written out as is. It means, that I can &lt;code&gt;(PRINC (CODE-CHAR 0..255) s)&lt;/code&gt; to a stream and expect 8-bit bytes to be written out, which is not obvious in the times of [[:w:Unicode|Unicode]] and 16 or 32 bit character representations. It does not require that the characters ä, ß, or þ must have their [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_char_c.htm CHAR-CODE] in the range 0..255 — the implementation is free to use any code. But it does require that no &lt;code&gt;#\Newline&lt;/code&gt; to CRLF translation takes place, among others.

Common Lisp has a long tradition of distinguishing character from byte (binary) I/O, e.g.[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_by.htm  READ-BYTE] and [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_cha.htm READ-CHAR] are in the standard. Some implementations let both functions be called interchangeably. Others allow either one or the other. (The [http://ww.telent.net/cliki/simple-stream simple stream proposal] defines the notion of a bivalent stream where both are possible.)

Varying element-types are useful as some protocols rely on the ability to send 8-Bit output on a channel. E.g. with HTTP, the header is normally ASCII and ought to use CRLF as line terminators, whereas the body can have the MIME type application/octet-stream, where CRLF translation would destroy the data. (This is how the Netscape browser on MS-Windows destroys data sent by incorrectly configured Webservers which declare unknown files as having MIME type text/plain — the default in most Apache configurations).
 
What follows is a list of implementation dependent choices and behaviours and some code to experiment.

* CLISP: On CLISP, faithful output is possible using
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
      :external-format
      (ext:make-encoding :charset 'charset:iso-8859-1 :line-terminator :unix)
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also use &lt;code&gt;(SETF (STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE F) '(UNSIGNED-BYTE 8))&lt;/code&gt;, where the ability to SETF is a CLISP-specific extension. Using :EXTERNAL-FORMAT :UNIX will cause portability problems, since the default character set on MS-Windows is CHARSET:CP1252. CHARSET:CP1252 doesn't allow output of e.g. (CODE-CHAR #x81):

&lt;pre&gt;
      ;*** - Character #\u0080 cannot be represented in the character set CHARSET:CP1252
&lt;/pre&gt;

Characters with code &gt; 127 cannot be represented in ASCII:

&lt;pre&gt;
      ;*** - Character #\u0080 cannot be represented in the character set CHARSET:ASCII
&lt;/pre&gt;

* CMUCL: &lt;code&gt;:EXTERNAL-FORMAT :DEFAULT&lt;/code&gt; (untested) — no unicode, so probably no problems.
* AllegroCL: &lt;code&gt;#+(AND ALLEGRO UNIX) :DEFAULT&lt;/code&gt; (untested) — seems enough on UNIX, but would not work on the MS-Windows port of AllegroCL.
* LispWorks: &lt;code&gt;:EXTERNAL-FORMAT '(:LATIN-1 :EOL-STYLE :LF)&lt;/code&gt; (confirmed by Marc Battyani) 

Here's some sample code to play with:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defvar *unicode-test-file* &quot;faithtest-out.txt&quot;)

(defun generate-256 (&amp;key (filename *unicode-test-file*)
			  #+CLISP (charset 'charset:iso-8859-1)
                          external-format)
  (let ((e (or external-format
	       #+CLISP (ext:make-encoding :charset charset :line-terminator :unix))))
    (describe e)
    (with-open-file (f filename :direction :output
		     :external-format e)
      (write-sequence
        (loop with s = (make-string 256)
	      for i from 0 to 255
	      do (setf (char s i) (code-char i))
	      finally (return s))
       f)
      (file-position f))))

;(generate-256 :external-format :default)
;#+CLISP (generate-256 :external-format :unix)
;#+CLISP (generate-256 :external-format 'charset:ascii)
;(generate-256)

(defun check-256 (&amp;optional (filename *unicode-test-file*))
  (with-open-file (f filename :direction :input
		     :element-type '(unsigned-byte 8))
    (loop for i from 0
	  for c = (read-byte f nil nil)
	  while c
	  unless (= c i)
	  do (format t &quot;~&amp;Position ~D found ~D(#x~X).&quot; i c c)
	  when (and (= i 33) (= c 32))
	  do (let ((c (read-byte f)))
	       (format t &quot;~&amp;Resync back 1 byte ~D(#x~X) - cause CRLF?.&quot; c c) ))
    (file-length f)))

#| CLISP
(check-256 *unicode-test-file*)
(progn (generate-256 :external-format :unix) (check-256))
; uses UTF-8 -&gt; 385 bytes

(progn (generate-256 :charset 'charset:iso-8859-1) (check-256))

(progn (generate-256 :external-format :default) (check-256))
; uses UTF-8 + CRLF(on MS-Windows) -&gt; 387 bytes

(progn (generate-256 :external-format
  (ext:make-encoding :charset 'charset:iso-8859-1 :line-terminator :mac)) (check-256))
(progn (generate-256 :external-format
  (ext:make-encoding :charset 'charset:iso-8859-1 :line-terminator :dos)) (check-256))
|#
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fast Bulk I/O==

If you need to copy a lot of data and the source and destination are both streams (of the same [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/26_glo_e.htm#element_type element type]), it's very fast to use [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_rd_seq.htm READ-SEQUENCE] and [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_wr_seq.htm WRITE-SEQUENCE]:

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(let ((buf (make-array 4096 :element-type (stream-element-type input-stream)))
  (loop for pos = (read-sequence input-stream)
        while (plusp pos)
        do (write-sequence buf output-stream :end pos))))
&lt;/source&gt;



==Creating a file ==
===text file ===

This function creates text file and writes string content to it. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socher.org/index.php/Main/WriteToFileInLisp Richard Socher :  Write To File In Lisp]&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
; definition of function 
(defun writeToFile (name content) ; content and name are both strings 
	(with-open-file 
		( stream  name ;  creating a stream object named name
		  :direction :output
		  :if-exists :overwrite
		  :if-does-not-exist :create ) ;  creates a file namend name if it does not already exist,
       (format stream content)) ; content is the input that is written to the file via the format function
     name) ; This function returns the name of the file for further processing ! 

; execution of function
(writeToFile &quot;a.txt&quot; &quot;hello word&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

===XPM file ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
; definition of function 
(defun write_To_XPM_File (file)
	; initial values of local variable 
	; which exist only for the duration of its scope, which in Lisp is the length of the let statement.
	( let( 
		(iWidth 4) ; the pixmap width
		(iHeight 4) ; the pixmap height,
		(NoColors 2) ; the number of colors
		(cpp 1))	  ;  the number of characters per pixel
	     
             (with-open-file 
		( st file 
		  :direction :output
		  :if-exists :overwrite
		  :if-does-not-exist :create )
       ; write XPM file header to the file
		(format st &quot;/* XPM */~%static char *a[] = {~%&quot;)
		(format st &quot;\&quot;~a ~a ~a ~a\&quot;,~%&quot; iWidth iHeight NoColors cpp)
		; write color table  to file 
		(format st &quot;\&quot;* c #000000\&quot;,~%&quot;) ;  black
		(format st &quot;\&quot;. c #ffffff\&quot;,~%&quot;) ; white
		; write strings containing line of pixel's colors
		(format st &quot;\&quot;.**.\&quot;,~%&quot;)
		(format st &quot;\&quot;.**.\&quot;,~%&quot;)
		(format st &quot;\&quot;.**.\&quot;,~%&quot;)
		(format st &quot;\&quot;.**.\&quot;,~%&quot;)
		; write end of the file 
	    (format st &quot;};~%&quot;)))    ;  ~%   is a    new line
	format t &quot;file was created &quot; file) ; t is a standard output 
) ; defun write_To_XPM_File

; execution of function
(write_To_XPM_File &quot;c.xpm&quot; )

&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://www.supercard.us/ SuperCard] is a Macintosh development environment. It is very similar to the venerable, and now defunct, HyperCard. It is made and sold by Solutions Etcetera. The latest version, 4.6, was released late in 2006 and supports the creation of Universal binaries (i.e. programs that run on both PowerPC and Intel based Macs).

Of all the HyperCard clones that have existed, SuperCard is the only one that currently focuses solely on Mac development. Some people see this as a weakness in today's world where delivering cross platform applications has become more and more common. Others see this as an asset due to SuperCard's ability to provide access to Mac specific features that otherwise wouldn't be desireable in attempting to deliver cross platform applications.

Being that it is a &quot;card based&quot; or &quot;stack based&quot; development environment, it has the following features:

*Windows
**Windows are the equivalent of stacks in SuperCard
*Cards
**Windows can contain many cards (or even just a single card)
*Backgrounds
**each card has one background
**cards within a window do not need to all have the same background
*A scripting language
**SuperCard's scripting language is called SuperTalk. It is very similar to HyperTalk, the scripting language of HyperCard and it belongs to a family of languages now known as xTalks (the &quot;x&quot; is usually pronounced &quot;cross&quot;)
*A player application
*The ability to create standalone applications

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linear Equations ==

A '''linear equation''' is an equation that forms a line on a graph.

=== Slope-Intercept form ===

A linear equation in '''slope-intercept form''' is one in the form &lt;math&gt;y = mx + b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the slope, and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the y-intercept. An example of such an equation is:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = 3x - 1&lt;/math&gt;

==== Finding y-intercept, given slope and a point ====
The '''y-intercept''' of an equation is the point at which the line produced touches the y-axis, or the point where &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; This can be very useful. If we know the slope, and a point which the line passes through, we can find the y-intercept. Consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = 3x + b&lt;/math&gt; Which passes through &lt;math&gt;(1,2)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2 = 3(1) + b&lt;/math&gt; Substitute &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, respectively&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2 = 3 + b&lt;/math&gt; Simplify.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-1 = b&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = 3x - 1&lt;/math&gt; Put into slope-intercept form.&lt;br /&gt;

==== Finding slope, given y-intercept and a point ====
The '''slope''' of a line is defined as the amount of change in x and y between two points on the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If we know the y-intercept of the line, and a point on the line, we can easily find the slope. Consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = mx + 4&lt;/math&gt; which passes through the point &lt;math&gt;(2,1)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = mx + 4&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1 = 2m + 4&lt;/math&gt; Replace &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
&lt;math&gt;-3 = 2m&lt;/math&gt; Simplify.
&lt;math&gt;-3/2 = m&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = -3/2x + 4&lt;/math&gt; Put into slope-intercept form.

----

=== Standard form ===
The '''Standard form''' of a line is the form of a linear equation in the form of &lt;math&gt;Ax + By = C&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are integers, and &lt;math&gt;A &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Converting from slope-intercept form to standard form ====
Slope-intercept equations can easily be changed to standard form. Consider the equation:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = 3x - 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-3x + y = -1&lt;/math&gt; Subtract -3x from each side, satisfying &lt;math&gt;Ax + By = C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x - y = 1&lt;/math&gt; Multiply the entire equation by &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying &lt;math&gt;A &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are already integers, so we don't have to worry about changing them.

==== Finding the slope of an equation in standard form ====
In the standard form of an equation, the slope is always equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac {-A}{B}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Using Algebra == 
Generally, you're not going to want to solve a system using graphs, simply because it takes too much time. There are two algebraic methods for solving systems of linear equations.



=== Addition ===
The ideal situation for the Addition method (also known as Elimination method) is one in which a variable in the two equations has opposite coefficients. For instance:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6x + 3y = 42&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2x - 3y = 22&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We would simply add up the values in the two equations, canceling out &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in the process.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;8x = 64&lt;/math&gt; This is the result of the initial addition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = 8&lt;/math&gt; Simplify.&lt;br&gt;
Now, all we have to do is substitute &lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt; for each occurrence of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,and solve for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6(8) + 3y = 42&lt;/math&gt; Substitute the value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;48 + 3y = 42&lt;/math&gt; Simplify.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3y = -6&lt;/math&gt; Subtract 48 from each side.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = -2&lt;/math&gt; Divide each side by 3.&lt;br&gt;

However, even if the variables don't easily cancel out, simply just try with constant multiplications and so on.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x + 8y = 48&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x - 4y = 22&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We would simply multiply the second equation throughout by 2 and get:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2x - 8y = 44&lt;/math&gt; Then add up:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = 4&lt;/math&gt; Substitute:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(8) - 4y = 22&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;- 4y = 18&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = -\frac{9}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

In some occasions, you may need to multiply both sides. For example:

&lt;math&gt;3y + 2x = 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4y + 3x = 10&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, we will multiply the first equation by three and the second equation by two.

&lt;math&gt;9y + 6x = 15&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;8y + 6x = 20&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y=-5&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;9 \times -5 + 6x = 20&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-45 +6x = 20&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6x=85&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = 14 \frac {1} {6}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Substitution ===
This is another method to solve a system of linear equations.  This is ideal if one of the equations is laid out where one variable has a coefficient of one or negative one.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = 3x + 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x + 2y = 16&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Here you can simply substitute the first algebraic expression that y equals in to the second.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x + 2(3x + 1) = 16&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Now simply slove the problem&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x + 6x + 2 = 16&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7x + 2 = 16&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7x + 2 - 2= 16 -2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{7x}{7}  = \frac{14}{7}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Then plug it into the equation you substituted earlier.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = 3(2) + 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = 6 + 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = 7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
To check your work simply plug both x and y into one part of your system.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x + 2y = 16&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;(2) + 2(7) = 16&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;16 = 16&lt;/math&gt; check.&lt;br/&gt;



Example where variable is not on one side:

&lt;math&gt;x + y = 9&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x + 5y = 25&lt;/math&gt;


Switch first equation so x is on one side

&lt;math&gt;x = 9 - y&lt;/math&gt;


Substitute

&lt;math&gt;3(9-y) + 5y = 25&lt;/math&gt;


Distribute and solve

&lt;math&gt;27 - 3y + 5y = 25&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2y = -2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = -1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x = 10&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Replace query */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Replace query ===

Replace query inserts new row if no row with such primary key exists or updates existing row if it does. SQL:2003 standard introduced a MERGE statement to implement such functionality, while other implementations provide similar queries named &quot;REPLACE&quot; or so-called &quot;Upsert&quot; query (a portmanteau of UPDATE and INSERT).

{{SQL comparison block entry
|standard = MERGE statement can be used to do a replace query:
&lt;pre&gt;
MERGE INTO table_name1 USING table_name2 ON (condition)
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET column1 = value1 [, column2 = value2 ...]
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT columns VALUES (values) 
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that MERGE is much more powerful than just doing replace queries.
|DB2 = MERGE statement
&lt;pre&gt;
MERGE INTO phonebook AS p
   USING ( VALUES ('john doe', '1234' ) ) AS v(name, extension)
   ON ( p.name = v.name )
   WHEN MATCHED
      UPDATE SET p.extension = v.extension
   WHEN NOT MATCHED
      INSERT VALUES ( v.name, v.extension )
&lt;/pre&gt;
|MySQL = Allows 3 syntaxes: non-standard REPLACE query, (since 4.1) INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE, and a variant on IF EXISTS. 
&lt;pre&gt;REPLACE [INTO] table [(columns)] VALUES (values)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;INSERT INTO table (columns) VALUES (values) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE column1=value1, column2=value2&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;IF EXISTS( SELECT * FROM phonebook WHERE name = 'john doe' )
THEN UPDATE phonebook SET extension = '1234' WHERE name = 'john doe'
ELSE INSERT INTO phonebook VALUES( 'john doe','1234' )
END IF&lt;/pre&gt;
|Oracle = MERGE statement
&lt;pre&gt;
MERGE INTO phonebook B
USING (
  SELECT name_id
  FROM phonebook
  WHERE name = 'john doe') E
ON (B.name = E.name)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET B.extension = '1234'
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (B.name, B.extension)
  VALUES ('john doe', '1234);
&lt;/pre&gt;
* Multi-statement form:
&lt;pre&gt;IF EXISTS( SELECT * FROM phonebook WHERE name = 'john doe' )
UPDATE phonebook SET extension = '1234' WHERE name = 'john doe'
ELSE
INSERT INTO phonebook VALUES( 'john doe','1234' )&lt;/pre&gt;
|Firebird = MERGE statement
&lt;pre&gt;
MERGE INTO phonebook B
USING (
  SELECT name
  FROM phonebook
  WHERE name = 'john doe') E
ON (B.name = E.name)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET B.extension = '1234'
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (name, extension)
  VALUES ('john doe', '1234);
&lt;/pre&gt;
Non-standard simplified form:
&lt;pre&gt;
UPDATE OR INSERT INTO phonebook (name, extension)
VALUES ('john doe', '1234')
MATCHING (name)
&lt;/pre&gt;

* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

= Alekhine's Defence : Lasker Attack =
In this variation, White will usually go on with 4. c5. He loses the control of the d5 square, but gains space and tries to close Black game.

For now, Black must play [[/3...Nb6/]].

= Preamble =
The U.S. graduate school system offers unparalleled opportunities but successful application is a complicated and lengthy process.
This wikibook aims to help you navigate the application process, especially if you are have not been educated in the US.

= Introduction =

== Why the U.S. ==

* Leadership in many scientific disciplines
* Top caliber academics with international exposure
* High national spending on research and development
* High caliber colleagues
* Hundreds of schools
* Freedom of thought, conscience and expression
* Competitive egalitarian society
* High standards of living and generous stipends
* Opportunity to form a network with future employers

== Why not the U.S. ==
* Limitations on employment after graduation
* Expensive tuition in some types of programs

== Picking the school and program ==
Several national and international organizations rank universities and even individual graduate programs:
* [http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankindex_brief.php USNews.com]
* [http://ed.sjtu.edu.cn/ranking.htm Shanghai Jiao Tong University Ranking]
* [http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/rankings/rankings.asp Princeton Review]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_and_university_rankings#USA Wikipedia - College and university rankings USA]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities Wikipedia - Academic Ranking of World Universities]

Such surveys are not always useful.  Consider your own school: are the things that make it attractive to outsiders the same as the things that you yourself value?  Probably sometimes these are actually different.  A particular graduate program may be great to you because you have found a good adviser or are working on a uniquely interesting project.  Rankings are attempts to quantify the qualities of education.  The criteria and methodologies used to generate such rankings are often scientifically unreliable and statistically invalid.

= Ingredients of a successful application =
Admission committees in many programs face mountains of applications and a very limited number of spots.  Thus, for an application to be successful
it 
* Must contain evidence that the applicant is a distinguished individual
* Demonstrate that the interests of the applicant nicely match the program he/she is applying to
* Not contain any obvious mistakes or exaggerations
* Be easily readable

Successful application must include high quality course grades, test grades, reference letters and a convincing personal statement.
It is important that ''all'' of the above are of a high quality and none can be used to eliminate the application in a preliminary round.
Probably the single most important factor is the reference letter, because members of the admission committee may know the author of the letter professionally.  If so, and if the letter is of a high quality, the application would receive a strong boost.  Course grades are least likely to be important because the admission committee may be skeptical of high grades: since it does not know how they were assigned, the grades can be inflated or unfair.

It is important to apply to more than one program even if you are the best because pure chance remains an important factor in the application's success especially when the program is very competitive.  For example, your application might resemble the application of another candidate in the stack of applications, or the people you want to work with happen to be overburdened at the time of your application.
It may also be useful to apply to several less competitive programs as a safety because the alternative is waiting a year before applying again.

== Reference letters ==
High quality reference letters could be very valuable.  A letter can
* Provide an account of your qualifications from a person whose authority the admission committee can recognize
* Praise you in ways that you cannot write yourself (you would be perceived as boastful and unobjective) 

Although many people may be willing to write you a reference letter, it is important to select your references carefully:
Admission committees have a great deal of experience reading between the lines.

The ideal reference is:
* Is a professor
* Has known you for a long time
* Has a record of internationally-recognized research
* Can communicate effectively in English

Admission committee members want to know as much objective information as possible so that they can tell for themselves.
Therefore, do not ask a person who owes you a favor but knows little of your academic work because the letter is not likely to be believed.
Likewise, ask your reference to explain in the letter ''why'' they are praising you (that is, objective facts), and not merely praise.

As well:
* Give plenty of time to write the letter
* Explain why you want to be admitted to each of the programs, so the letters can be customized
* Remind the writer about accomplishments that can be listed in the letter
* Follow up on your request with reminders about deadlines

== Relevant Experience ==
Graduate programs typically make requirements of the students that are different from the requirements of undergraduate studies.
Whereas undergraduates are typically asked to attend classes or do assignments, graduate students often face open problems and no clear deadlines, and are often required to teach.  The difference in requirement means that students who have done well as undergrads find themselves under-prepared for the graduate student experience.  Few things can be more frustrating to departments than seeing promising applicants become mediocre graduate students.  As a result, admission committees actively seek applicants which document success in the kind of challenges graduate students face.  This includes:
* Research experience
* Initiative
* Creativity
* Perseverance and focus
* Evidence for success in work on open problems
* Ability to communicate effectively in English

The above list includes some general personality attributes.  Consequently, it is useful to mention in the application evidence for these, even if it does not directly relate to the field of study.  For example, starting a yoga club may demonstrate initiative, even if the application is for a program in biology.  However, beware: these activities should not occupy much of the application.  Graduate studies require individuals who know what they want to do, and therefore excessive information about side activities could make you appear unfocused.

= Funding =
As a general rule, students in Ph.D. programs do not pay tuition and actually receive additional money sufficient for a modest living.  Typically, funding is provided as long as the student maintains good grades, does work (as a teaching or research assistant) and completes the degree within a given time frame (usually 4-5 years).  That said, it is important to look at the specific program details for more information:  see if the department website or your admission letter says anything about guaranteed funding, and if so, for how long.  Press them with specific questions.  If you have an intended adviser, ask how would you be supported if the adviser abandons you in the middle of your degree.

In Master's or professional programs, the funding situation could be very different.

= Tips =
# Contact potential advisers in advance of your application.  Contacting the faculty members is an extra opportunity to demonstrate that you are interested in the program.  By expressing interest in working with a particular person, you can make your application stick out during the selection process, especially if the professor in question is in the selection committee.  As well, in some universities, applications circulate between faculty members and the students are only admitted if there is a faculty member who selects the student's application.  You may be surprised by the openness of professors to answer questions or to communicate with you.


= Frequently Asked Questions =
Q. Why do applications ask about race of the applicant - is race a factor?

:A. No, or nearly so.  The information is collected because publicly-funded universities are required by law to report the composition of their student body.  That said, it is possible that race plays a small role in the application, due to affirmative action.  Affirmative action is a policy of giving preferential admission to applicants from groups which are under-represented in the student body compared to the general population, increasing the diversity of the campus.  Recent court ruling and laws have weakened such policies.  In sum, race is not an important factor in success.

Q. I have been offered to pay for my program by working as a teaching or research assistant.  Do I need to get a work visa?

:A. No.  Work in the university which is related to your program of study does not require an additional visa beyond your student visa.

Q. I have heard that the US does not have health insurance.  What happens if I get sick?

:A. Actually, in many if not the majority of schools, graduate students receive comprehensive health insurance from the university.

This riposte from White is more dangerous than it looks. The possible sacrifice on f7 can be deadly if Black dares to take the offered pawn ([[/2...Nxe4/]]).

Is Black wants to avoid this, he may try to get the bishop out of c4 with [[/2...b5/]]. If White takes the pawn, Black can take the e4 pawn and he would have exchanged a wing pawn against a central pawn!

Other options include [[/2...e6/]] and [[/2...d5/]].

To get back into more peaceful lines, Black can transpose to the [[Chess/Bishop's Opening|Bishop's Opening]] with [[Opening_theory_in_chess/1. e4/1...e5/2. Bc4/2...Nf6|e5]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">WHAT IS ECONOMY?
Lionel Robines the well known British economist has this to say “Economy is the study of the use of scare resources which have alternative use.” What is scare? It means something that is difficult to obtain and the society wants more of it. The simplest way to describe is economy is the production of goods and services in every day life.

    The job of economist is decided for example how much oil, iron, or wood a nation needs weather or not is going to be sufficient. The economy also discusses the well being of a society and the cause and effect of prices that industry offers.

     Economy is not always about the money; when a plane crashes and there are certain amount of food and medicine scare; the decision has to be made wisely for the distribution of goods among the people. Otherwise, some survivors may die of deep wounds or hunger.

     A child must be introduced to basic economy from the third grade on just as a child being thought about sports from early childhood. This education will come handy in life when a child has to make a decision between buying a candy or a computer game with his allowance.

     There are many types of economy: Socialist, Capitalist, Feudalist, and Command Economy. A country shall blooms into a productive, prosperous nation that knows its economics well.</text>

Among the four legal moves, Kf6 and Ke6 aren't good options. Both moves would further expose the king.

[[/4...g6/]] and [[/4...Kg8/]] are playable but none of these moves can save the knight.

Nobody loves this one!  However maybe the reason is it appears to be a large collection of links that go nowhere.  I guess it could be a speedy but I thought I'd play safe.  '''Delete''' is my vote (not a lot of point in transwiki ing or correctly linking what is in some senses an empty page) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''.  Realy can't see the point of this book and it is mostly a collection of external and uploaded links. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 20:13, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''. Was going to vote neutral given that it has structure, but the links don't work, I couldn't find the stuff on Wikisource and the No meaningful content but has structure. I imagine that the army distance learning link was to a password protected site. No public use from this book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:01, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

==Included books==

The following books have been included in this wikibook (or we are working on it!), with permission of the author:

* [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf Not So Short Introduction to LaTex2e] by Tobias Oetiker, Hubert Partl and Irene Hyna. We have contacted the authors by email asking for permission: they allowed us to use their material, but they never edited directly this wikibook. That book is released under the GPL, that is not compatible with the GFDL used here in Wikibooks. Anyway, we have the permission of the authors to use their work. You can freely copy text from that guide to here. If you find text on both the original book and here on Wikibooks, then that text is double licensed under GPL and GFDL.

* [http://sarovar.org/projects/ltxprimer/ LaTeX Primer] from the Indian TeX Users Group. Their document is released under the ''GNU Free Documentation License'', the same as Wikibooks, so we can include parts of their document as we wish. In any case, we have contacted Indian TeX Users Group and they allowed us to do it.
* David Wilkins' [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/ Getting started with LaTeX]. The book is not released under any free license, but we have contacted the author asking him for the permission to use parts of his book on Wikibooks. He agreed: his work is still protected but you are allowed to copy the parts you want on this Wikibook. If you see text on both the original work and here, then that part (and only that part) is released under the terms of GFDL, like any other text here on Wikibooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Moved the COALESCE function from String functions ==
...and into Misc. expressions, because COALESCE is not specific just to strings.  It also works with date/time data types, exact numerics, approximate numerics, etc.  The majority of DBMS's probably all follow the standard regarding CAST, COALESCE and NULLIF (which I moved all into the Misc. expressions category), but I'm not sure...  so I'll leave it to someone else to add that information.  The COALESCE() function definitions in the misc. expressions page were taken from the string functions page.  I imagine most platforms that implement COALESCE do so according to the standard, but since they weren't listed like that on the other page I've moved them over &quot;as is&quot;.  Please modify as appropriate.

Also, by definition, COALESCE and NULLIF are shorthand for equivalent searched CASE expressions.  Any platform that does not have COALESCE but does have searched CASE expressions should have the equivalent searched CASE expression listed in place of COALESCE or NULLIF.  E.g.:

  COALESCE (val1, val2, val3)

Is equivalent to:

  CASE WHEN val1 IS NOT NULL THEN val1
    WHEN val2 IS NOT NULL THEN val2
    WHEN val3 IS NOT NULL THEN val3
    ELSE NULL END

...etc.[[User:SqlPac|SqlPac]] 17:38, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

== SQL/XML Section ==
I added information about Microsoft's proprietary XML support (via the xml data type) in the SQL/XML section, along with footnotes describing them.  For all of the SQL/XML functions specified, MSSQL was designated &quot;n/a&quot; in every area; but MSSQL 2005 does support almost all of the same functionality specified, but with proprietary extensions, such as the .query() method of the xml data type.  Please review and let me know if it would make more sense to break it out into its own section or leave it in the side-by-side comparison format you currently have.  Thanks.[[User:SqlPac|SqlPac]] 17:06, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

== Possible additions? ==
Two suggestions:  In the &quot;Data types&quot; section, add a &quot;Standard SQL&quot; column that contains the data types as defined by the ISO/IEC standards, possibly including their aliases (&quot;VARYING CHARACTER&quot;, etc.)  Also, add a section for Binary data types (&quot;BINARY&quot;, &quot;VARBINARY&quot;, &quot;BIT&quot;, etc.)  If I can get a better handle on how to edit these tables without breaking the format, and there are no objections, I'll add these in.  I only know the ANSI standard and MS SQL Server implementations specifically though, so someone else would need to fill in the blanks on Oracle, et al.  Thanks.[[User:SqlPac|SqlPac]] 16:38, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

== SQL/XML section ==

SQL/XML section: it's obvious that it was created by person who knows Oracle better than other DBMSs and standard papers (I mean only SQL/XML, no more). The list of functions is non-standard, DB2 and SQL Server are not covered properly. I'm going to rework this section taking latest drafts of ISO/ANSI 9075-14 as a basis. Also, it's worth to create additional section concerning &quot;XML type&quot; subsection in &quot;Data types&quot; (btw, &quot;XML type&quot;, not &quot;XMLType&quot;, the latter is oracloism :-) )
--[[User:Samokhvalov|Samokhvalov]] 18:11, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
:Sure, feel free to do it, if you're better understand the subject. One thought: try to make every section a separate Wiki page. It will tremendously ease editing for us. --[[User:GreyCat|GreyCat]] 20:03, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

*½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:nutmeg|nutmeg]]

== Procedure ==

#In a saucepan on low heat warm raisins and orange juice until liquid is absorbed, then set aside.
#In large bowl beat butter cream cheese with sugar until fluffy, add eggs one at a time and orange rind. Stir again.
#In a separate bowl mix flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg, stir into batter adding raisin mixture.
#Spoon into a greased and floured 9 inch tube pan or bundt pan.
#Bake in 300°F (~160°C) oven for about 80 minutes. Check it at 60 minutes with a cake tester stick.
#Let cool in pan for 5 minutes  turn onto a rack to cool completely.
#This cake can be eaten a day later no fuss no waiting around for it to age.


This recipe was written out by my husbands sister who passed away at a very young age of 37, 12 Christmases ago. Thought we'd keep her cake alive and pass it on.
We have no idea what recipe book this is out of but lets keep it alive as a memory cake.

Diane and Lorne Merry Cake Christmas to one and all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Aggregate functions ====

Aggregate function operate on a group of values, returning single scalar value. The standard specifies that with the exception of VAR_POP, VAR_SAMP, STDDEV_POP and STDDEV_SAMP all aggregate function should be able to handle one of two additional quantifier before an argument: '''ALL''' (feature ID E091-06) and '''DISTINCT''' (feature ID E091-07). '''ALL''' is the default and can be omitted and '''DISTINCT''' means that only unique values would be passed in aggregate function. To make presentation more compact, these two quantifiers aren't discussed separately for every function, but specified as '''[DISTINCT|ALL]''' if function supports both of them.

The General Educational Development Test, or GED, is a test that certifies the taker has attained American or Canadian high school-level academic skills. To pass the GED, the test taker must perform in at least the 40th percent of high school seniors nationwide, though individual states can set their own requirements for passing. Some states also require that students take an additional test showing an understanding of federal, state, and/or local government. This test is also sometimes referred to as a .

The GED is taken by individuals who did not obtain a high school diploma. The GED tests were originally created to help veterans after World War II complete basic high school courses in preparation for returning to civilian life. Common reasons for GED recipients not having received a high school diploma include immigration to the United States or Canada; homeschooling; and leaving high school early due to a lack of interest, the inability to pass required tests, or personal problems. Individuals that pass the test receive a General Equivalency Diploma, confusingly also called a GED.

More than 15 million students have received the GED since its inception. One in every seven Americans with high school credentials received the GED, as well as one in twenty college students. 70% of GED recipients complete at least the 10th grade before leaving school, and the same number are over the age of 19, with the average age being 24.

In addition to English, the GED test is available in Spanish, French, large print, audiocassette, and braille. Tests and test preparation are routinely offered in correctional facilities and on military bases in addition to more traditional settings. American and Canadian students living outside of those two countries can take the GED test on-line.

==History of the GED==
The GED test was originally developed in 1942. Two primary reasons for developing the test were the number of American men being sent overseas to fight in World War II before they could complete their high school education, and the number of people leaving school early to join the largely industrial work force.

In 1972, a new series of the test was released. While the test designed in 1942 was adequate for a time period in which most jobs were industrial and required no education beyond high school, the marketplace in the 1970s required a broader understanding of academic subjects. The new series addressed this issue, and also better prepared students for education beyond the high school level. The 1972 series also required more critical thinking than the 1942 edition, which mainly required the student to recall general facts.

The series was revised for the third time in 1988. The most noticeable change to the series was the addition of a writing sample, which had never been required before. A greater emphasis was placed on socially relevant topics, and more problem-solving skills needed to be demonstrated. For the first time, more students (65%) were taking the test to continue their education beyond high school than to get better employment (30%).

The GED series currently used is the 2002 series, which is considered to be the most challenging series so far. More business-related topics are covered, and the test contains more questions and written passages relevant to adults. Although students are not required to perform a scientific experiment, they must explain how to conduct one, interpret results, and apply information gathered. Written passages are also more multicultural, reflecting the large number of immigrants taking the test.

==Pretesting and registration==
In order to register to take the GED testing battery, most students must show their level of competency by taking pretests. In most districts, students are required to take a mathematics pretest, followed by one additional test in a subject area of their choosing. (Students cannot take the essay portion, as they cannot be graded by anyone other than test administrators.) Each of these tests contain 25 questions which are representative of what will be asked on the actual GED test; no time limit is given.

In some districts, students must answer approximately 15-20 questions accurately in order to register to take the GED test. Proof of identity and residency are required in order to register; accepted forms of identification include driver's licenses, birth certificates, and passports. Students must then fill out forms that are submitted to their individual state and local school or adult education district(s) for review in order to ensure the student has officially withdrawn from the school system.(if under the age of 18) Depending on the district, a student will have to wait anywhere from one week to three months to take the actual GED test.

In some states, if a student does not receive a desirable score on the pretests, they will most likely not be allowed to register for the GED test. In this case, they will be encouraged to privately study until they are ready to take the pretests again, or they will be enrolled in an adult education program in order to prepare for the GED test.

==Test preparation==
In the United States, federal and state Adult Education programs have been in operation since the 1960s. A major purpose of the Adult Education Act of 1991, and subsequent revisions in the law, is to aid adults to complete their secondary school education. Through Adult Education, free or very low cost classes are available in every state state and territory. Still many people take the GED by studying on their own.

In response to a lower than expected pass rate (30%) for most people taking the test for the first time, some local adult education boards have begun to require that individuals either take a course before they take the GED, or take a remedial course if they do not pass the first time.

During these classes, usually held at least once a week, students review the high school material that they learned in a traditional school setting, and they are also taught about subjects they did not receive formal instruction in. Textbooks are used for these classes, and homework is often assigned to students. Individual tutoring is also offered in some districts.

Due to the diverse subject areas covered by the GED test, many different topics are covered in preparatory classes and textbooks. Students will typically cover many topics in these classes that will not come up on the GED test itself. For example, a student may spend several months learning about medieval history, only to find that questions about the time period do not appear on their final test. This is done to ensure that the student truly does have a broad understanding of each of the topic areas, and has not simply &quot;crammed&quot; for the test prior to taking it.

In addition to formal test preparation, students are also able and encouraged to prepare on their own in private. As with similar tests, many test preparation books are offered for the GED. These books offer practice tests, tips for passing the GED test, and guidelines to help students determine areas in which they need improvement. Many books also offer extensive information on the various subject areas covered by the test, similar to textbooks students use in traditional high school settings. Students can read books that cover all academic areas of the test, or just the area(s) in which they need more assistance. Some commercial tutoring centers also offer preparation specifically for the GED test.

==How the test works==
Although the term &quot;GED test&quot; is often used, students must pass 5 individual tests in order to obtain their GED. These are known collectively as the testing battery. The five tests in the battery are: Language Arts, Writing; Social Studies; Science; Language Arts, Reading; and Mathematics. The Language Arts, Writing test is further divided into Part I and Part II, and the Mathematics test is split into a calculator-optional portion and a calculator-free one.

Depending on the state and district, students may or may not have to take all of the tests at the same time. Due to the length of the testing battery, most districts divide the tests into two or more days, and testing sessions are not always consecutive. In larger districts, students are usually given the option of taking their tests on multiple consecutive days or evenings, or they can take them on two consecutive weekends, depending on which time frame is more convenient for them.

===Language Arts, Writing===
====Part I====
The Language Arts, Writing testing portion is divided into two parts. Part I covers sentence structure, organization, usage, and mechanics. Students are provided with passages which they are then asked to correct or improve according to Edited American English standards, or equivalent standards in the French version of the test offered in Canada.

30% of Part I covers structure, 15% organization, 30% usage, and 25% mechanics. Common questions include asking students to identify where punctuation should be placed and how sentences in a paragraph should be arranged for maximum clarity. Common misspellings, subject-verb agreement, and capitalization are also covered. Students receive 75 minutes to complete the 50 questions comprising Part I.

====Part II====
Part II of the Language Arts, Writing test requires the student to write an essay. Students have 45 minutes to complete the essay, though anyone who finishes Part I early can add the remaining time from that portion to their essay writing period. A passing essay must have at least 5 paragraphs and must contain a clearly defined introduction, body, and conclusion. The introduction must contain a thesis statement as well as preview sentences of the body. The body should contain three paragraphs, each containing separate yet related ideas that develop the main idea. The final paragraph must adequately and coherently summarize the whole essay.

All essay subjects are assigned. The topics selected do not require any special knowledge or advance reading on the student's part; instead, they focus on general interest topics that most people are familiar with and comfortable discussing, verbally or in print. Example subjects include the influence of violent music on teenagers, the advantages or disadvantages of a &quot;child-free&quot; lifestyle, and the importance of receiving a diploma in modern society.

Part II is the only test within the GED testing battery that is not scored by computer. The essay is read by two reviewers within the state or testing district where the test has been taken. These reviewers each assign the essay a score between 1 (worst) and 4 (best); the scores are then averaged to find the final score. If a student receives an average score of less than 2, Part I is not scored and the student has to take both parts of the Language Arts, Writing test again. In some districts, a student must pass the essay before they are allowed to take any other tests in the battery.

===Social Studies===
The Social Studies portion of the GED testing battery covers 5 main content areas. 25% of the test focuses on American history, 15% on world history, 25% on civics and government, 20% on economics, and 15% on geography. Students are given 70 minutes to answer the 50 questions asked on the Social Studies test.

Like the majority of the GED testing battery, the Social Studies test requires the student to read short passages, after which they select answers to questions using a multiple-choice format. Some of the passages used come from famous documents like the Declaration of Independence and United States Supreme Court decisions. Many use graphs, charts, and other types of images in addition to or in place of written passages, which the student then must use to arrive at the appropriate conclusion; on graphical questions, some basic mathematical skills may be required. Others involve editorial cartoons, typically with no context provided, that the student must examine critically. At least one question on each test asks the student to look at a photograph and identify a famous figure, moment in history, or the general scene being depicted, such as a political rally or child labor.

Questions involving civics and government and economics rely heavily on practical documents, such as tax forms, voter registration forms, and workplace and personal budgets. Topics such as global warming and environmental law are addressed by the questions about geography.

===Science===
The Science test, which contains 50 questions that must be answered in 80 minutes, contains questions about life science (45%), earth and space science (20%), and physical science (35%).

Most questions on the Science test involve a graphic such as a map, graph, chart, or diagram. Subjects covered include photosynthesis, weather and climate, geology, magnetism, energy, and cell division. Few of the questions require the student to demonstrate outside knowledge, since most are dependent on the text and graphics provided. Questions that do require outside knowledge are generally questions about common, everyday scientific matters, such as &quot;Which household product can be hazardous when mixed with bleach?&quot; (Answer: ammonia.)

===Language Arts, Reading===
The Language Arts, Reading test contains 40 questions that must be answered within 65 minutes. Passages from various texts are provided, after which students are asked to think critically about the subjects, characters, and ideas presented and answer approximately 5 questions about each passage. The questions asked are used to judge a student's level of comprehension as well as their skills with application, analysis, evaluation, and synthesis.

Two non-fiction and three fiction passages are presented, along with one passage from a poem and another from a dramatic play. Common sources for text selections are famous novels, such as My Ántonia by Willa Cather, and the works of famous poets like Maya Angelou and Robert Frost. Students are not expected to have read these works prior to taking the test, though students who have a broad knowledge of literature are known to perform better on the Language Arts, Reading test due to their ability to place each passage in context more easily when thinking critically about them.

===Mathematics===
Like the Language Arts, Writing test, the Mathematics test is divided into two parts, though they are not as distinct as the former's parts. The test's 50 questions, to which students have 90 minutes to respond, are divided in half, with the first half being calculator-optional.

The Mathematics test focuses on four main mathematical disciplines: numbers and operations (20-30%), measurement and data analysis (20-30%), algebra (20-30%), and geometry (20-30%). Approximately 20% of the test uses standard grids and coordinate plane; these questions are not multiple choice.

Common topics covered include circumference, square roots, ratios and proportions, the multiplying and dividing of vulgar fractions and decimals, volume, exponents, angles, and the Pythagorean theorem. Students must have at least a basic knowledge of both the American measurement system as well as the metric system in order to answer many questions.

Calculators are issued at the testing site, and no external calculators may be used. Scrap paper is also provided so students may work problems out using pen or pencil, though no paper may be taken out of the testing room after completion in order to prevent students from giving their answers to others who may not have taken the test yet. Students are also provided with a list of common formulas, though this is controversial because some critics consider this to be too much assistance for those taking the test.

===Test administration===
There are more than 3,500 testing sites in the United States and Canada. Testing sites differ from district to district, but they are most commonly municipal high schools or other public schools.

For students in large population areas, they often have a choice of two or more testing sites, which they can list according to preference when registering to take the GED test. The test administrator(s) will then determine which site each student may take their test at by reviewing factors such as distance from home; the number of students taking the test on any given day; and whether or not two students taking the test at the same place and time have ever been in school together previously, which could indicate a desire for them to cheat off of each other's work.

GED testing sites are kept as controlled environments. The only items all students are allowed to bring into the testing room are pens, pencils, and erasers; in some districts, food and drink are allowed for students who are taking all 5 tests in the same day, in order to prevent them from becoming famished or ill during breaks. Any items other than writing implements, including food, coats, and hats, are subject to confiscation by the test administrator(s), and may only be given back at the test's conclusion unless a need is demonstrated.

There are approximately 25 different editions of the GED tests that are used by administrators. This is done to prevent students from cheating off of each other's work. Each edition of the test is assigned a number as well as a color; for example, one test edition might be both &quot;3&quot; and &quot;yellow.&quot; Each student uses the same edition for the entire testing battery to make scoring easier. Other students taking the test at the same time and place will use a different edition of the test. All editions are judged to be at the same level of difficulty, and each version contains the same number of questions in each skill area.

===Students with disabilities===
For students with documented physical disabilities, there are numerous accommodations available. Students with vision impairments can use braille, audio cassette, or large print editions, as well as talking calculators. Students with physical disabilities can receive additional time, scribes, frequent breaks, use of a private room, and other accommodations as required. Sign language interpreters are available, and tests can be conducted at a person's home or health facility if they are unable to travel.

For students with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, attention-deficit disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and dyscalculia, accommodations can be made with written proof of the disability. As with students with physical disabilities, students with learning disabilities can receive extra time, use of a private room, or any other accommodations deemed necessary.

In order to receive accommodations, students must present documentation of their disabilities to the test administrator well in advance of the testing date. If students do not submit their request for review by the deadline, they will most likely be turned down for accommodations. Exceptions to this rule include students who break a limb in the days before their test or are hospitalized. If a student requests accommodations and is turned down, they can either wait until the next testing date available or submit an appeal to their state's board of education.

===Passing the GED testing battery===
The maximum score anyone can receive on an individual GED test is 800. A score of 800 puts the student in the top 1% of all test-takers for that individual test nationally. The minimum passing score varies from state to state.

If a student passes some but not all tests within the battery, they are not required to retake the entire battery; instead, they only need to retake the portion(s) they did not pass. In most states, students are limited to a set amount of times they can take any portion of the battery each year, meaning that there will generally be a waiting period of a few months or more before they can take the failed test again. Students can take any test as many times as it takes them to pass, though most states charge a fee for each retest.

In most states, students must receive a minimum score on each individual test, as well as an overall average that is higher than the minimum individual score. The most common standard is no individual test score below 410, and an average score on all tests of no lower than 450. Minimum scores and averages are also set for honors diplomas. In some districts, graduation ceremonies are held for GED graduates, and scholarships are also awarded to the highest scorers each session.

The GED itself is issued by the state or territory in which the student resides, though it is scored by a national testing service located in Maryland. Like other diplomas, they are valid and accepted in each U.S. state.

==Colleges, employers, and the GED==
People who left high school without graduating often find that employers and post-secondary institutions will not accept them without showing some form of academic competency. Since adults often cannot or will not return to high school, receiving the GED allows them to demonstrate that they possess a skill level comparable to that of an average high school graduate.

Approximately 95% of colleges will accept GED graduates, though they will typically require them to take the SATs and/or ACT. Some admissions boards request extra letters of recommendation in addition to the standard number already required of applicants when reviewing GED applicants. (Homeschooled students who receive the GED are the main exception to this rule, since many homeschooled students cannot receive traditional diplomas and need to finish their high school careers with the GED.) If a 4-year college will not accept a GED graduate, they can attend any community college in the United States, after which they can transfer to almost any 4-year school.

The main problem GED recipients encounter when trying to transfer from community colleges to 4-year schools is the lack of SAT and/or ACT scores, which GED recipients typically do not have. Due to this and other factors, most colleges do not require transfer students to submit such scores when applying beyond a certain point in their college careers, typically after one year or earning approximately 30 college-level credits. Many colleges, especially public institutions, also offer scholarships and other forms of financial aid specifically for GED recipients in order to help them finance their education.

==Eligibility==
Most states and provinces do not allow students who are under the minimum age to take the GED test. Exceptions can be made for students who are over 16 years old, but below the minimum age requirement. These vary by location, but generally include:
* acceptance into a post-secondary school upon successful completion
* employer has indicated that it is required for promotion/employment
* a military recruiter has shown that it is required to enlist in the armed forces.
Students under 16 years of age are usually not permitted to take the test under any circumstances. In selected states to take your GED tests you must at least be 18 or wait for your freshman (9th grade) class to graduate.

==Criticism of the GED==
For most purposes, a GED is considered to be the same as a high school diploma. Some feel the test is easier than it should be, and it is looked down upon by some employers as a lower form of degree than an actual high school diploma. Others believe the GED is harder than it should be; according to GED Testing Service statistics from the &quot;2003 GED Statistical Report,&quot; the number of candidates who tested, completed, and passed the tests declined in 2002 and 2003. Some attribute this decline to the new test released in 2000 being too difficult.

The most common criticism is of the test battery's mainly multiple choice format. Others argue that the reading comprehension test is too simplistic, and that there are too many basic operations on the mathematics portion and not enough advanced algebra and geometry questions.

Supporters argue that the 70% rate of incompletion on the first try at taking the test shows that it is harder than commonly believed, although this can be attributed to the majority of the test takers being high school dropouts. They also point out that the test is administered to a representative sample of graduating high school seniors each year, and about 30% fail.[1]

In response to these criticisms, the test was revised in 2002 to make it more difficult to pass. One of the most important revisions was one which made it more difficult to guess correct answers from the choices provided. This greater degree of difficulty is achieved by demanding students to show the process for finding the correct answer to a question, as opposed to simply providing a result. For example, a typical mathematics question will not ask what the second leg of a right-angled triangle is when the length of only the first leg and the hypotenuse is given, but instead which formula should be used to find the correct answer. This requires the student to not only know the correct answer, but also explain how to find it. It also uses both algebra and geometry, as opposed to just one discipline of mathematics.

A number of the questions also contain options such as &quot;Not enough information given,&quot; &quot;None of the above,&quot; and &quot;No correction is necessary&quot; as possible answers. These are found most frequently on the Mathematics and Language Arts, Writing: Part I tests.

== The &quot;Metal Etch&quot; paragraph has only links, but a book should be self-contained! ==

Relying on outside documents is both unwise since that content will not be there (may already not be there) in the future, and it is detrimental to the quality of the book.

== Very good resource, but is one allowed to use it? ==

The following is a very good resource on etch rates in the micro-electronics industry.

'''Flexible Learning''' is a set of educational philosophies and systems, concerned with providing learners with increased choice, convenience, and personalisation to suit the learner. In particular, flexible learning provides learners with choices about where, when, and how learning occurs. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_Learning#See_also Wikipedia Dec 06]

This page will assist you in understanding the principles of Flexible Learning by exploring related information, ideas and new practices in formal education. After reading through this information, and taking up opportunities for learning support it is hoped you will be able to apply flexible teaching and learning techniques in your own contexts.

=Learning support and accreditation=
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otago_Polytechnic Otago Polytechnic] offers formal learning and acreditation services with their Designing for Flexible Learning Practice course.

=Content=
Flexible Learning is a recent concept with many varying interpretations. No one interpretation is correct, leaving room for many interesting and useful ideas. For this reason 
==What is flexible learning?==
==Things to consider==
==Planning for flexible teaching and learning==
==Aligning with an educational organisation==

==Weblog==
Document your progress in a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weblog weblog]
==Resource list==
Establish and maintain a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking social bookmarking list] with links to information relating to flexible learning
==Develop a resource==
Choose an issue or consideration relating to flexible learning, (for example: accessibility, digital divides, practical skills learning, assessment) and create an learning resource that reports on the issue and suggests solutions.
==Develop a plan==
In your weblog, create an entry that is the start of a plan for developing learning flexibility in your course or field of study. The plan should refer to intended learning outcomes, the typical learner profile, trends and directions in industry or sector, and benefits to learners and educational organisation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When asked which is the greatest commandment, Jesus replied, 

:&quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.&quot; (Mt 22:37-40)

These, however, are not really two, but one single commandment, the spheres of operation of which are completely inseparable. He did say the second is like the first. Although these specific commandments are not found among the Ten Commandments of Exodus, in so many words, all else follows from this commandment. There is no need for any other law—if you're sufficiently well-versed in logic and theology.

In Judaism, however, no commandment is more &quot;important&quot; than another. However, some are more &quot;fundamental.&quot; The most fundamental of the commandments is one of the following three:

I am your God along with You shall have no other gods before Me

Listen, O Israel, the God is your God, that same God is One.

And you shall not take revenge and you shall not begrudge a child of your nation, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself, I am God.

appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Ton-Tongue toffees''''' are products of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes|Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] that make the tongue of the person eating them become several feet long.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Possibly the start of the &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Skiving Snackbox|Skiving Snackbox]]&quot; line, this is an early Weasley's product that was first tested out on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dudley Dursley|Harry's cousin Dudley]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']]. This got [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Fred and George Weasley|the twins]] into a lot of trouble with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|their father]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|mother]].

== Analysis ==

Something of a throw-away idea, the Ton-Tongue Toffees are used to prank Dudley, and then are taken away and destroyed by Mrs. Weasley, and we never see them again. While they have physiological effects on the person eating them, and so could be placed in the Skiving Snackboxes line, the effects are not something that would require a visit to the Hospital wing, and so don't have a major part in the Twins' story.

'''Poinsettias''' (''Euphorbia pulcherrima'') are flowers native to southern Mexico, Central America, and Africa. They are named after Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first United States ambassador to Mexico, who introduced the plant in the U.S. in 1825. Alternative names for the poinsettia are '''Mexican flame leaf''', '''Christmas star''', '''Christmas flower''', '''Winter rose''', '''Noche Buena''' and '''Pascua'''.

In the U.S., poinsettias can be found in the wild in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

==Description==
Poinsettias are shrubs to small trees, typically reaching a height of 0.6 to 4 m (2 to 16 ft). The plant bears dark green dentate leaves that measure 7 to 16 cm (3 to 6 inches) in length. The top leaves, known as bracts, are flaming red, pink, or white and are often mistaken as flowers. The actual flowers are the small yellow structures found in the center of each leaf bunch, which are called Cyathia.

Cultivars have been produced with orange, pale green, cream and marbled leaves. There are over 100 varieties of poinsettias available.

==Growing conditions==
In areas outside its natural environment it is commonly grown as an indoor plant where it prefers good morning sun then shade in the hotter part of the day. However they are widely grown and very popular in subtropical climates such as Sydney, Australia.

As this is a subtropical plant, it will likely perish if the nighttime temperature falls below 10° C (50° F) so is not suitable for planting in the ground in milder climates. Likewise daytime temperatures in excess of 21° C (70° F) tend to shorten the lifespan of the plant.

The Poinsettia can be difficult to induce to reflower after the initial display when purchased. The plant requires a period of uninterrupted long, dark nights for around two months in autumn in order to develop flowers. Incidental light at night during this time will hamper flower production. When watering it is important to allow the plant to drain out any excess water. Having a Poinsettia sit in water can do harm to the plant as it prefers moist soil to direct water.

==Varieties==
&lt;!--General discussion or bulleted list.--&gt;

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;
Its extract is useful for burn

==Maintenance==
*April 1:  Reduce watering, 60 degrees F (15 Celsius)
*May: Cut back stems to 3-6 inches above the soil.  Re-pot or separate if needed.  Place in sunny window and water when soil is dry to touch. (Root cuttings if desired) 
*June: Move plant outside.  Water and fertilize more frequently as plant grows. 
*July 1: First pinch. 
*September 1: Bring plant indoors to sunny location at 65 degrees to 75 degrees F (18-23 Celsius). 
*October: Initiate short days (for mid-December bloom date)  Water as needed and fertilize weekly according to the label. 

Thrives in room temperatures of 68 to 70 degrees F (15-21 Celsius). Do not put plants on top of a television or near fireplaces where the heat will be excessive. Also, avoid cold drafts and temperatures below 50 degrees F. Protect plants from chilling winds when transporting during the holidays.

== Infinite Blocks ==

I would very much appreciate it if you took whatever tool you used to make infinite blocks of open proxies and zombies on this wiki to ''unblock'' every single infinitely blocked IP address blocked as part of a project on open proxies that has not been sanctioned at Wikibooks.  Blocking an IP for an infinite period is ''never'' called for.  IP addresses change hands, zombies get taken out of service or cleaned up, and proxy servers don't stay up forever. I'm getting very tired of retiring the blocks by hand.  Thanks. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:04, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
:I didn't use any tools to make those blocks, they had all been done by hand (like most things back then :-) ). If I remember correctly, infinite blocks on some open proxies were standard practice back in 2007. In fact, the policy page originally had stated that &quot;Open or anonymising proxies may be blocked for any period at any time.&quot; I don't remember the exact reason why I had chosen to block that batch of IP's indefinitely as I didn't with others... but I'd be happy to help you remove the blocks. --[[User:Az1568|Az1568]] ([[User talk:Az1568|talk]]) 22:53, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

::Interesting.  You worked pretty quickly for doing it all by hand.  I wonder if they had the gadget that enabled mass blocking of IPs at [[Special:Massblock]] back then.  However, if it was by hand, I do not want to impose, especially since there were others besides yourself making infinite blocks that worry me today about collateral damage.  Your work on the fundraising is a higher priority. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 00:26, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

I remember for a time there use to be a localized effort to mass block open proxies. At the time I believe local and Wikimedia-wide policy recommended blocking zombies and open proxies indefinitely. People did block by hand, but I do remember there being a list somewhere that made the process a whole lot easier because it included a link to take you to the block form with the reason and time filled out. The list may also have included other links to allow checking local and global contributions, a way to confirm that IP addresses were still an open proxy, and to check the status of IP addresses with major blacklists. I believe the list had been generated using a script to obtain a list of open proxies blocked from other projects. I think that is why everyone that participated in blocking was able to do it pretty quickly. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:02, 29 December 2010 (UTC)

== WCI 2011 : Accelerating Wikibooks : Would like to discuss! ==


Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:20, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]

{{branch unstable}}
:''Previous versions of this guideline, and discussion thereof can be found at [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]].''

Decisions on Wikibooks are decided by the community in a variety of ways. The most important tools that Wikibookians have to make decisions are '''compromise''' and '''consensus'''. 

Issues at Wikibooks can be divided into two different categories, depending on the extent to which they affect the Wikibooks community over time. The decisions that have a large, long-term effect on Wikibooks are called high impact decisions. Otherwise they are low impact decisions. 

== Be Bold ==
Not all actions need to go through the decision making process. As indicated by the [[Wikibooks:Be bold|Wikibooks:Be bold]] guideline, in situation that objections are not expected, Wikibookians are encouraged to '''be bold''' in making changes that will benefit the project and the community.

== Low impact decisions ==
'''Low impact decisions''' involve proposals that express the community's preferences and feelings about issues that fall well below the level of policies and guidelines, and do not affect the long term culture or structure of Wikibooks. For these sorts of decisions, Wikibookians are welcome to employ multiple means for decision-making, including consensus, majority votes or 3rd party arbitration. The manner in which a dispute will be settled should be agreed upon before any particular method is employed. 

Examples of low impact decisions are:

#Determining [[WB:FB|Featured books]]
#Creating or altering the content, structure or scope of a particular book

Some low impact situations, such as nominating [[WB:FB|featured books]] already have their own rules that should be followed.

Should a decision need to be made that affects a single module, book or project it will usually use the rules for high impact decisions except where all parties agree to use another basis.

== High impact decisions ==
'''High impact decisions''' involve the adoption, major adaptation or repeal of policies and guidelines that have a long term effect on the culture and structure of Wikibooks. These decisions should always be made through the process of building a community consensus. Such decisions include:

#Making a Wikibookian an [[WB:RFA|administrator]]
#Making a Wikibookian a [[WB:RFA|bureaucrat]]
#Giving a Wikibookian [[WB:RFA|checkuser rights]]
#Creating or modifying Wikibooks [[WB:PAG|Policies and operational guidelines]]
#Establishing the voting rules for low impact decisions
#Determining whether a page containing substantive content that is not unambiguously outside our inclusion criteria should be [[WB:VFD|deleted]]

== Terminology ==
We will use the term ''proposal'' here to mean the change that is being discussed by the community. We will use the term ''discussion'' to mean the process of Wikibookians voicing their opinions and working towards compromise. Wikibookians do not &quot;Vote&quot; on anything, but we discuss points, compromise, and try to reach consensus.

== Who is eligible to discuss ==
Any Wikibookian may discuss any issue, and voice their opinions. Each person is allowed one voice, not one voice per username.  Wikibookians with multiple accounts should not post opinions from more than one account. Remember: comments are judged on their quality, not on their quantity. Comments that are suspected of being cast in bad faith can be discarded. Comments made anonymously may also be disregarded or discarded.

== How is a discussion run ==
The proposal and each comment in a discussion is signed (using four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), to identify the writer. Discussions continue long enough to give interested Wikibookians a reasonable chance to participate. High-impact proposal discussions continue as long as there is progress towards a consensus and they must be publicized in [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] or other high-traffic areas, even announced on the [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|bulletin board]].

== Community consensus ==
'''Community consensus''' is a general agreement by most interested participants that attempts to resolve or mitigate minority objections, [[Wikibooks:Decision making#Example process|the process for arriving at an agreement]], and both the preceding and concluding state before and after the process. All consensus decision making processes rely upon users acting in good faith to come to an acceptable decision through negotiation and compromise. Ultimately the state of &quot;community consensus&quot; may involve the vast majority of users agreeing on some decision. However Wikibooks is not a democracy, and a simple voter majority is not the default, nor the recommended method of deciding the outcome of any discussion.

=== Example process ===
This is a step-by-step process for outlining a community discussion, and working towards consensus. It serves to illustration how people can work together towards a common goal through negotiation and compromise, and resolve or mitigate minority objections. Other guidelines and policies may define specific requirements for specific types of decisions.

# A proposal is made in the most relevant or previously selected location for that decision. If not a high traffic location, an announcement is made in a high traffic location to assure interested Wikibookians are made aware of it.
# Any concerns are discussed and proposed compromises addressed. The proposal may be modified during this time.
# A call for consensus is made. A [[w:Straw poll|straw poll]] may be used to determine the degree of consensus.
# If there are no unresolved objections, &quot;community consensus&quot; is reached and the proposal is accepted.
# If there are unresolved objections:
#* The proposal may be dropped with &quot;no community consensus&quot; reached.
#* The proposal may be modified to address objections and resubmitted for discussion.
#* The proposal may have all objected to parts removed, and &quot;community consensus&quot; is reached.
#* A call to determine any consensus may be made. However this should not be done lightly, and should only occur after substantial [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|good faith]] discussion of both the proposal and objections. The community may at this point:
#** Not accept the proposal as &quot;community consensus&quot; has not been reached. The proposal may be modified and the process repeated, if necessary.
#** Accept a modified proposal with some or all objected to parts removed, and &quot;community consensus&quot; is reached.
#** Accept the proposal in spite of objections, and &quot;community consensus&quot; is reached.

=== User responses ===
Users who disagree with a community decision, have the option to:

# Propose alternatives. Previous discussion(s) should be presented and considered. A good reason to readdress the issue must also be explained. However this should never be done soon after a decision is made, if a different outcome is unlikely.
# Accept the community's decision.
# Ultimately, users unable to abide by the decision may need to reconsider their future participation in the project.

== Following this Guideline ==

Wikibookians are encouraged to '''[[WB:BOLD|be bold]]''' when making changes, and they are encouraged to compromise and work as a community to solve problems. There is no single &quot;right way&quot; to achieve community consensus, and the steps outlined above only give a rough example of one version of that process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chapter One

We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a &quot;new fellow,&quot; not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a large desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if just surprised at his work.

The head-master motioned us to sit down. Then, turning to the class-master, he said to him in a low voice—

&quot;Monsieur Roger, here is a pupil whom I recommend to your care; he'll be in the second. If his work and conduct are satisfactory, he will go into one of the upper classes, as becomes his age.&quot;

The &quot;new fellow,&quot; standing in the corner behind the door so that he could hardly be seen, was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller than any of us. His hair was cut square on his forehead like a village chorister's; he looked reliable, but very ill at ease. Although he was not broad-shouldered, his short school jacket of green cloth with black buttons must have been tight about the arm-holes, and showed at the opening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being bare. His legs, in blue stockings, looked out from beneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by braces, He wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
===Notes===
* Note the narration is in the first person ''plural''. Strangely, in subsequent chapters we lose this narration and switch to the third person omniscient. We never find out who the mysterious 'we' of the first chapter are.
* Study carefully the portrait of the &quot;new fellow&quot;. His haircut is like that of a 'village chorister' (member of a choir). He is furthermore described as looking 'reliable, but very ill at ease'. Flaubert here describes quite neatly the character of Charles Bovary, the new boy. 
* The colours of the clothing mentioned by the narrator are worth noting: Charles wears a green jacket, with yellow trousers and blue stockings. Quite simply, Charles' fashion sense is terrible - he wears colours that clash horribly with each other. Why does Flaubert depict Charles like this?
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

We began repeating the lesson. He listened with all his ears, as attentive as if at a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or lean on his elbow; and when at two o'clock the bell rang, the master was obliged to tell him to fall into line with the rest of us.

When we came back to work, we were in the habit of throwing our caps on the ground so as to have our hands more free; we used from the door to toss them under the form, so that they hit against the wall and made a lot of dust: it was &quot;the thing.&quot;

But, whether he had not noticed the trick, or did not dare to attempt it, the &quot;new fellow,&quot; was still holding his cap on his knees even after prayers were over. It was one of those head-gears of composite order, in which we can find traces of the bearskin, shako, billycock hat, sealskin cap, and cotton night-cap; one of those poor things, in fine, whose dumb ugliness has depths of expression, like an imbecile's face. Oval, stiffened with whalebone, it began with three round knobs; then came in succession lozenges of velvet and rabbit-skin separated by a red band; after that a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard polygon covered with complicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long thin cord, small twisted gold threads in the manner of a tassel. The cap was new; its peak shone.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
===Notes===
*Again, Charles' clothing reveals his character. His cap is of 'composite order'(made up of many materials). The detailed description Flaubert gives suggests that the cap is something of immense ugliness, setting Charles up as a figure of ridicule.
*Notice that the cap is compared to an 'imbecile's face' - perhaps a pointed reference to Charles himself.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&quot;Rise,&quot; said the master.

He stood up; his cap fell. The whole class began to laugh. He stooped to pick it up. A neighbor knocked it down again with his elbow; he picked it up once more.

&quot;Get rid of your helmet,&quot; said the master, who was a bit of a wag.

There was a burst of laughter from the boys, which so thoroughly put the poor lad out of countenance that he did not know whether to keep his cap in his hand, leave it on the ground, or put it on his head. He sat down again and placed it on his knee.

&quot;Rise,&quot; repeated the master, &quot;and tell me your name.&quot;

The new boy articulated in a stammering voice an unintelligible name.

&quot;Again!&quot;

The same sputtering of syllables was heard, drowned by the tittering of the class.

&quot;Louder!&quot; cried the master; &quot;louder!&quot;

The &quot;new fellow&quot; then took a supreme resolution, opened an inordinately large mouth, and shouted at the top of his voice as if calling someone in the word &quot;Charbovari.&quot;

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
===Notes===
* By now, the reader has a clear picture of Charles' character. Particularly important in the depiction are the adjectives 'stammering', 'inordinately', and 'unintelligible', as well as the nouns 'sputtering' and 'tittering'. Charles has, from the first chapter of the book, been associated with mediocrity and ridicule.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
A hubbub broke out, rose in crescendo with bursts of shrill voices (they yelled, barked, stamped, repeated &quot;Charbovari! Charbovari&quot;), then died away into single notes, growing quieter only with great difficulty, and now and again suddenly recommencing along the line of a form whence rose here and there, like a damp cracker going off, a stifled laugh.

However, amid a rain of impositions, order was gradually re-established in the class; and the master having succeeded in catching the name of &quot;Charles Bovary,&quot; having had it dictated to him, spelt out, and re-read, at once ordered the poor devil to go and sit down on the punishment form at the foot of the master's desk. He got up, but before going hesitated.

&quot;What are you looking for?&quot; asked the master.

&quot;My c-a-p,&quot; timidly said the &quot;new fellow,&quot; casting troubled looks round him.

&quot;Five hundred lines for all the class!&quot; shouted in a furious voice stopped, like the Quos ego*, a fresh outburst. &quot;Silence!&quot; continued the master indignantly, wiping his brow with his handkerchief, which he had just taken from his cap. &quot;As to you, 'new boy,' you will conjugate 'ridiculus sum'** twenty times.&quot;

Then, in a gentler tone, &quot;Come, you'll find your cap again; it hasn't been stolen.&quot;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;&gt;
===Notes===
**'''Quos ego''': A quotation from the Aeneid signifying a threat.
**'''Ridiculus sum''': I am ridiculous.
*Look at the construction of the paragraph beginning 'a hubbub'. This long sentence contains the two subjects ('a hubbub' and 'they', not including the 'damp cracker' of the final simile) which take between them nine verbs. The grammatical contruction of the sentence evokes the action of the 'hubbub'.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Quiet was restored. Heads bent over desks, and the &quot;new fellow&quot; remained for two hours in an exemplary attitude, although from time to time some paper pellet flipped from the tip of a pen came bang in his face. But he wiped his face with one hand and continued motionless, his eyes lowered.

In the evening, at preparation, he pulled out his pens from his desk, arranged his small belongings, and carefully ruled his paper. We saw him working conscientiously, looking up every word in the dictionary, and taking the greatest pains. Thanks, no doubt, to the willingness he showed, he had not to go down to the class below. But though he knew his rules passably, he had little finish in composition. It was the cure of his village who had taught him his first Latin; his parents, from motives of economy, having sent him to school as late as possible.

His father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, retired assistant-surgeon-major, compromised about 1812 in certain conscription scandals, and forced at this time to leave the service, had taken advantage of his fine figure to get hold of a dowry of sixty thousand francs that offered in the person of a hosier's daughter who had fallen in love with his good looks. A fine man, a great talker, making his spurs ring as he walked, wearing whiskers that ran into his moustache, his fingers always garnished with rings and dressed in loud colours, he had the dash of a military man with the easy go of a commercial traveller.

Once married, he lived for three or four years on his wife's fortune, dining well, rising late, smoking long porcelain pipes, not coming in at night till after the theatre, and haunting cafes. The father-in-law died, leaving little; he was indignant at this, &quot;went in for the business,&quot; lost some money in it, then retired to the country, where he thought he would make money.

But, as he knew no more about farming than calico, as he rode his horses instead of sending them to plough, drank his cider in bottle instead of selling it in cask, ate the finest poultry in his farmyard, and greased his hunting-boots with the fat of his pigs, he was not long in finding out that he would do better to give up all speculation.

For two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of the provinces of Caux and Picardy, in a kind of place half farm, half private house; and here, soured, eaten up with regrets, cursing his luck, jealous of everyone, he shut himself up at the age of forty-five, sick of men, he said, and determined to live at peace.

His wife had adored him once on a time; she had bored him with a thousand servilities that had only estranged him the more. Lively once, expansive and affectionate, in growing older she had become (after the fashion of wine that, exposed to air, turns to vinegar) ill-tempered, grumbling, irritable. She had suffered so much without complaint at first, until she had seem him going after all the village drabs, and until a score of bad houses sent him back to her at night, weary, stinking drunk. Then her pride revolted. After that she was silent, burying her anger in a dumb stoicism that she maintained till her death. She was constantly going about looking after business matters. She called on the lawyers, the president, remembered when bills fell due, got them renewed, and at home ironed, sewed, washed, looked after the workmen, paid the accounts, while he, troubling himself about nothing, eternally besotted in sleepy sulkiness, whence he only roused himself to say disagreeable things to her, sat smoking by the fire and spitting into the cinders.

When she had a child, it had to be sent out to nurse. When he came home, the lad was spoilt as if he were a prince. His mother stuffed him with jam; his father let him run about barefoot, and, playing the philosopher, even said he might as well go about quite naked like the young of animals. As opposed to the maternal ideas, he had a certain virile idea of childhood on which he sought to mould his son, wishing him to be brought up hardily, like a Spartan, to give him a strong constitution. He sent him to bed without any fire, taught him to drink off large draughts of rum and to jeer at religious processions. But, peaceable by nature, the lad answered only poorly to his notions. His mother always kept him near her; she cut out cardboard for him, told him tales, entertained him with endless monologues full of melancholy gaiety and charming nonsense. In her life's isolation she centered on the child's head all her shattered, broken little vanities. She dreamed of high station; she already saw him, tall, handsome, clever, settled as an engineer or in the law. She taught him to read, and even, on an old piano, she had taught him two or three little songs. But to all this Monsieur Bovary, caring little for letters, said, &quot;It was not worth while. Would they ever have the means to send him to a public school, to buy him a practice, or start him in business? Besides, with cheek a man always gets on in the world.&quot; Madame Bovary bit her lips, and the child knocked about the village.

He went after the labourers, drove away with clods of earth the ravens that were flying about. He ate blackberries along the hedges, minded the geese with a long switch, went haymaking during harvest, ran about in the woods, played hop-scotch under the church porch on rainy days, and at great fetes begged the beadle to let him toll the bells, that he might hang all his weight on the long rope and feel himself borne upward by it in its swing. Meanwhile he grew like an oak; he was strong on hand, fresh of colour.

When he was twelve years old his mother had her own way; he began lessons. The cure took him in hand; but the lessons were so short and irregular that they could not be of much use. They were given at spare moments in the sacristy, standing up, hurriedly, between a baptism and a burial; or else the cure, if he had not to go out, sent for his pupil after the Angelus*. They went up to his room and settled down; the flies and moths fluttered round the candle. It was close, the child fell asleep, and the good man, beginning to doze with his hands on his stomach, was soon snoring with his mouth wide open. On other occasions, when Monsieur le Cure, on his way back after administering the viaticum to some sick person in the neighbourhood, caught sight of Charles playing about the fields, he called him, lectured him for a quarter of an hour and took advantage of the occasion to make him conjugate his verb at the foot of a tree. The rain interrupted them or an acquaintance passed. All the same he was always pleased with him, and even said the &quot;young man&quot; had a very good memory.

     *A devotion said at morning, noon, and evening, at the sound
     of a bell. Here, the evening prayer.

Charles could not go on like this. Madame Bovary took strong steps. Ashamed, or rather tired out, Monsieur Bovary gave in without a struggle, and they waited one year longer, so that the lad should take his first communion.

Six months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally sent to school at Rouen, where his father took him towards the end of October, at the time of the St. Romain fair.

It would now be impossible for any of us to remember anything about him. He was a youth of even temperament, who played in playtime, worked in school-hours, was attentive in class, slept well in the dormitory, and ate well in the refectory. He had in loco parentis* a wholesale ironmonger in the Rue Ganterie, who took him out once a month on Sundays after his shop was shut, sent him for a walk on the quay to look at the boats, and then brought him back to college at seven o'clock before supper. Every Thursday evening he wrote a long letter to his mother with red ink and three wafers; then he went over his history note-books, or read an old volume of &quot;Anarchasis&quot; that was knocking about the study. When he went for walks he talked to the servant, who, like himself, came from the country.

     *In place of a parent.

By dint of hard work he kept always about the middle of the class; once even he got a certificate in natural history. But at the end of his third year his parents withdrew him from the school to make him study medicine, convinced that he could even take his degree by himself.

His mother chose a room for him on the fourth floor of a dyer's she knew, overlooking the Eau-de-Robec. She made arrangements for his board, got him furniture, table and two chairs, sent home for an old cherry-tree bedstead, and bought besides a small cast-iron stove with the supply of wood that was to warm the poor child.

Then at the end of a week she departed, after a thousand injunctions to be good now that he was going to be left to himself.

The syllabus that he read on the notice-board stunned him; lectures on anatomy, lectures on pathology, lectures on physiology, lectures on pharmacy, lectures on botany and clinical medicine, and therapeutics, without counting hygiene and materia medica—all names of whose etymologies he was ignorant, and that were to him as so many doors to sanctuaries filled with magnificent darkness.

He understood nothing of it all; it was all very well to listen—he did not follow. Still he worked; he had bound note-books, he attended all the courses, never missed a single lecture. He did his little daily task like a mill-horse, who goes round and round with his eyes bandaged, not knowing what work he is doing.

To spare him expense his mother sent him every week by the carrier a piece of veal baked in the oven, with which he lunched when he came back from the hospital, while he sat kicking his feet against the wall. After this he had to run off to lectures, to the operation-room, to the hospital, and return to his home at the other end of the town. In the evening, after the poor dinner of his landlord, he went back to his room and set to work again in his wet clothes, which smoked as he sat in front of the hot stove.

On the fine summer evenings, at the time when the close streets are empty, when the servants are playing shuttle-cock at the doors, he opened his window and leaned out. The river, that makes of this quarter of Rouen a wretched little Venice, flowed beneath him, between the bridges and the railings, yellow, violet, or blue. Working men, kneeling on the banks, washed their bare arms in the water. On poles projecting from the attics, skeins of cotton were drying in the air. Opposite, beyond the roots spread the pure heaven with the red sun setting. How pleasant it must be at home! How fresh under the beech-tree! And he expanded his nostrils to breathe in the sweet odours of the country which did not reach him.

He grew thin, his figure became taller, his face took a saddened look that made it nearly interesting. Naturally, through indifference, he abandoned all the resolutions he had made. Once he missed a lecture; the next day all the lectures; and, enjoying his idleness, little by little, he gave up work altogether. He got into the habit of going to the public-house, and had a passion for dominoes. To shut himself up every evening in the dirty public room, to push about on marble tables the small sheep bones with black dots, seemed to him a fine proof of his freedom, which raised him in his own esteem. It was beginning to see life, the sweetness of stolen pleasures; and when he entered, he put his hand on the door-handle with a joy almost sensual. Then many things hidden within him came out; he learnt couplets by heart and sang them to his boon companions, became enthusiastic about Beranger, learnt how to make punch, and, finally, how to make love.

Thanks to these preparatory labours, he failed completely in his examination for an ordinary degree. He was expected home the same night to celebrate his success. He started on foot, stopped at the beginning of the village, sent for his mother, and told her all. She excused him, threw the blame of his failure on the injustice of the examiners, encouraged him a little, and took upon herself to set matters straight. It was only five years later that Monsieur Bovary knew the truth; it was old then, and he accepted it. Moreover, he could not believe that a man born of him could be a fool.

So Charles set to work again and crammed for his examination, ceaselessly learning all the old questions by heart. He passed pretty well. What a happy day for his mother! They gave a grand dinner.

Where should he go to practice? To Tostes, where there was only one old doctor. For a long time Madame Bovary had been on the look-out for his death, and the old fellow had barely been packed off when Charles was installed, opposite his place, as his successor.

But it was not everything to have brought up a son, to have had him taught medicine, and discovered Tostes, where he could practice it; he must have a wife. She found him one—the widow of a bailiff at Dieppe—who was forty-five and had an income of twelve hundred francs. Though she was ugly, as dry as a bone, her face with as many pimples as the spring has buds, Madame Dubuc had no lack of suitors. To attain her ends Madame Bovary had to oust them all, and she even succeeded in very cleverly baffling the intrigues of a port-butcher backed up by the priests.

Charles had seen in marriage the advent of an easier life, thinking he would be more free to do as he liked with himself and his money. But his wife was master; he had to say this and not say that in company, to fast every Friday, dress as she liked, harass at her bidding those patients who did not pay. She opened his letter, watched his comings and goings, and listened at the partition-wall when women came to consult him in his surgery.

She must have her chocolate every morning, attentions without end. She constantly complained of her nerves, her chest, her liver. The noise of footsteps made her ill; when people left her, solitude became odious to her; if they came back, it was doubtless to see her die. When Charles returned in the evening, she stretched forth two long thin arms from beneath the sheets, put them round his neck, and having made him sit down on the edge of the bed, began to talk to him of her troubles: he was neglecting her, he loved another. She had been warned she would be unhappy; and she ended by asking him for a dose of medicine and a little more love.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why not introduce with simple mathmatical notions:  ODE's reverse ordinary differential operators, PDE's reverse partial differential operators?  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 11:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that.&lt;BR&gt;
I have seen concepts of operators but they're rarely taught, and only for linear equations.

[[User:Ben pcc|Ben pcc]] 17:20, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

To put it bluntly, this article is wrong. It confuses the distinction between PDEs and ODEs with some very specific usage of them. Whether the variables themselves are actually discrete or not in the real world, they are modelled as continuous before ANY derivative is taken (whether partial or not). When the dynamics of real world phenomena are simulated on a computer, they are made to be discrete in various ways no matter whether they are based on PDE theory or ODE theory. ODEs have no such connection to discrete entities and the real world media need not be continuous for it to have variables that can be described by a PDE.

One way in which ODEs and PDEs DO differ is that ODEs only have one independent variable and PDEs have many. You use PDEs to effectively turn multivariate systems into multiple ODEs each of which treats all variables, except one, as constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Negative Constant==
It isn't /completely/ arbitrary, because one needs to rule out that they might equal a positive constant or zero, leaving only the negative constant case shown in this module.  Well, it /can/ be a positive or zero constant; but this leaves you with the trivial solution.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 11:29, 18 December 2006 (UTC)


In context, how the constant is described is arbitrary. -k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will work, so will k or k&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or k&lt;sup&gt;-300&lt;/sub&gt;. Leaving out the negative sign would lead to complex numbers which nobody seams to like.

[[User:Ben pcc|Ben pcc]] 04:42, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

I'm talking about clarifying the k&gt;0 for your -k^2 used, and the reason behind this without losing generality.

You want to avoid getting the trivial solutions:

* u_t=u_xx
* u(0,t) = 0
* u(1,t) = 0
* T'/T=(d^2X/dx^2)/X=A^2 (say A&gt;0)
* (d^2X/dx^2)-AX = 0 -&gt; X=0, thus we don't assume the constant is positive because we aren't looking for the trivial solution
* (d^2X/dx^2)/X=-A^2 -&gt; X!=0 which is a non-trivial solution, which is what we're looking for.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 10:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)


&quot;If we took A = 0, the solution would have just been u(y, t) = 0, which would satisfy the BCs and the PDE but couldn't possibly satisfy the IC. So, we take k = nπ instead, where n is any integer. So far: [...]&quot;

In this first example you don't construct series, you determine that A is not zero and so k = nπ. n is later identified. No trivial solution; the IC picks n.

[[User:Ben pcc|Ben pcc]] 17:22, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

You're right, in this case the IC takes care of it.  I took my PDE class with a bunch of engineers, so it was rather cookbookish:  check that the sln. with k&gt;0, k&lt;0, k=0.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:16, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

==Sides are Constant Proof==

Fephisto, I'm afraid I removed your proof because it was wrong. Look:


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\part}{\part t} \left(\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)}\right) = \frac{\part}{\part t} \left(\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\part}{\part t} \left(\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)}\right) = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)} = f(y)\,&lt;/math&gt;


The integration performed with respect to t produces a constant with respect to t, in other words a function of y.

Thanks for the many fixes. I always thought it was spelled &quot;independant&quot;. I'll be careful not to use &quot;unkown&quot; also.

[[User:Ben pcc|Ben pcc]] 00:51, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

Spelling is pretty minor, don't worry about it.

Huh, I'm kind of skeptical of this whole thing now, because the above proof I gave you is the /exact/ proof my old textbook gave me (I had, in fact, copied it directly from there).  And, no offense, I trust the textbook more than you.  Let me sit back and think about it for a bit.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 02:58, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\part}{\part t} \left(\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)}\right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{T'(t)}{\nu T(t)}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

Since we have defined T as a function solely of t, correct?  From that step the rest follows.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:02, 14 January 2007 (UTC)


Ahhh, ok, I see. You take a partial derivative which later becomes a ordinary derivative (but couldn't take total to begin with). I'll notate it right now. I did always kind of feel unsatisfied saying &quot;the sides are obviously equal to a constant&quot;.

[[User:Ben pcc|Ben pcc]] 18:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

Can't the proof be simplified to just taking &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; of both sides to begin with, instead of partialing and then reducing to a &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;?  I think this simplifies the proof a bit, so I'll go ahead and change that now.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 20:39, 1 February 2007 (UTC)


I'm not sure if it's correct. t and y are related via u, so taking a total derivative would require application of the chain rule, wouldn't it?

Or maybe not, since they're both independant variables. Not sure. Oh well.

{{Version|PHP|PHP 5.0 and above|The PHP Data Objects extension requires features that were introduced in PHP 5.0, and will not be available to users of PHP 4.x and below.}}

=PHP Data Objects=

'''PHP Data Objects''', also known as '''PDO''', is an interface for accessing databases in PHP without tying code to a specific database.  Rather than directly calling ''mysql_'', ''mysqli_'', and ''pg_'' functions, developers can use the PDO interface, simplifying the porting of applications to other databases.

==How do I get it?==

The PHP Data Objects extension is currently included by default with installations of PHP 5.1.  It is available for users of PHP 5.0 through PECL, but does not ship with the base package.

PDO uses features of PHP that were originally introduced in PHP 5.0.  It is therefore not available for users of PHP 4.x and below.

==Differences between PDO and the MySQL extension==

PHP Data Objects has a number of significant differences to the MySQL interface used by most PHP applications on PHP 4.x and below:

* Object-orientation.  While the ''mysql'' extension used a number of function calls that operated on a connection handle and result handles, the PDO extension has an object-oriented interface.
* Database independence.  The PDO extension, unlike the ''mysql'' extension, is designed to be compatible with multiple databases with little effort on the part of the user, provided standard SQL is used in all queries.
* Connections to the database are made with a '''Data Source Name''', or '''DSN'''.  A DSN is a string that contains all of the information necessary to connect to a database, such as 'mysql:dbname=test_db'.

==PHP Data Objects usage example==
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;$dsn = 'mysql:dbname=database_name;host=localhost';
$dbuser = 'database_user';
$dbuserpw = 'database_user_password';

try
{
    $connection = new PDO($dsn, $dbuser, $dbuserpw1);
}
catch (PDOException $e)
{
    echo 'There was a problem connecting to the database: ' . $e-&gt;getMessage();
}

$query = $connection-&gt;query(&quot;SELECT * FROM table&quot;); // querying the database&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

For more information on data source names and the elements in a DSN string for a specific PDO driver (such as MySQL and PostgreSQL), see [http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php PHP: PDO Drivers - Manual]

== Dear Contributing Author ==

''Welcome! I'll get right to business, this text is designed to be a '''comprehensive''' and '''easy-to-read''' text on economics for the beginner. That's not to say that this text is watered-down or dumbed-down in any way. The goal is to create a rich text that is approachable for individuals with NO economic background. In other words, this text should be the ideal for introducing students to economics and possess enough material to validate it as a strongly comprehensive representation of economic knowledge. But, we want to keep it basic. This means:

*''assume no previous economics knowledge''
*''assume no extensive mathematical background''
:*''i.e. explain thoroughly math tools and concepts(see the note on math below)''

''That's really it for the serious stuff regarding this text. If you have questions please ask other contributors; otherwise read on for more information about how I think we ought to organize this text.''

''Thank you!''

== Organizing [[Principles of Economics]] ==
===Comprehensive===
[[Principles of Economics]] is designed to be a very competitive text on economic theory. That is, a text designed to compete with expensive economics textbooks widely used in universities for introductory or lower-division economics courses. But the scope of [[Basic Economics]] will hopefully extend beyond that of those texts and become the best text available as an introduction to economics.

In order to achieve this effect, [[Principles of Economics]] must be '''very''' comprehensive. It should include all but the most specific and more difficult of economic facets and detail them on a basic level. The idea is to introduce the concepts in such a way that the student/reader can choose to pursue further study on the material presented in other, more advanced texts, or if they do not choose to do so, they will still walk away with an improved and useful understanding of that material.

'''Bottome Line''': introduce economic material. Introduce A LOT of economic material. Make it simple and useful. Period.

===Mathematics===
Because [[Principles of Economics]] is an introductory text to the field, we are going to assume a multitude of readers, some with heavy mathematical backgrounds and some without. The way we ought to handle this dilemma by introducing concepts initially on a basic and math-friendly level and then gradually explaining them in greater detail and with more complex math models later on so that novice economists and expert economists can both take something away from [[Principles of Economics]]. I also think [[Principles of Economics]] ought to possess a dedicated math appendix that will cover the most basic algebra concepts on through calculus and (hopefully) linear algebra as applied to economic models, especially those presented in the text. Also, we are free to assume that the reader is highly proficient in elementary math, graphical mathematics and the Cartesian coordinate system.

It wouldn't be out of the question, however, to include in the dedicated math appendix some ''refreshers'' on graphing along with the algebra. Furthermore, some basic calculus could be explained in an advanced section of the math appendix, but this should only be included when the time comes that it is essential to include it.

'''Bottom Line''': Math is the economist's friend. So let's make sure that we can provide mathematical applications that will enlighten both the math-prone and the math-averse.

===Making Contributions===
One aspect that Wikibooks can allow for over other wikis is the ability to rephrase things in different ways so as to enhance the reader's understanding. Basically I think it's a good idea to add onto topics if you think you can phrase it in a way that will compliment the current material. I really don't think chopping up and revising a topic until it fits nicely into a three-sentence synopsis that explicitly defines the subject in a manner that only makes sense to those ''already'' familiar with the concept does much of anything but embellish the pride of the savvy and alientate the curious students without any knowledge of the subject. That is to say:
*If you think a concept is discussed on too-basic a level, add a section (preferably near the bottom) for more advanced students
*If you think a concept is discussed on too-advanced a level, add a section (preferably near the top) for more novice students

===Study Materials===
[[Principles of Economics]] should be no different than its non-gratis counterparts in that it should contain helpful study materials like:
*end of chapter summary
*practice questions
*practice tests
*real-world examples and applications
*chapter objectives
*key terms
*quality diagrams

It would also be great to have some solid real-world data, but this can be time-consuming to gather and organize so is not as expected as the other tools, but it is however equally, if not more, desired. As long as we have some tools for the student and they are, above all things, ''consistent'' from chapter to chapter, then [[Principles of Economics]] ought to have a worthwhile chance contending in the market for introductory economics textbooks.

'''Bottom Line''': while the study enhancement materials are second to the actual content, they are an important component and should be utilized uniformly.

===Your Thoughts===

== Remove &lt;nowiki&gt;{{alphabetical}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template? ==

Should we remove the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{alphabetical}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template from the modules of this book? I assume we should, and that no one has taken the time.  Is there a good reason we are using it here? Thanks, --[[User:Jcarroll|Jcarroll]] ([[User talk:Jcarroll|talk]]) 04:25, 23 December 2008 (UTC)

== Chapter structure == 

Will this book have a traditional 'section/chapter' structure? Right now most of the content seems loosely organized under 'models', not as a progressive developmental text book.  Would the primary maintainer welcome reorganization? [[User:Jcress410|Jcress410]] ([[User talk:Jcress410|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jcress410|contribs]]) 01:42, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

how could we get an compiled doc or pdf version of the book?

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Albert Einstein -- the man who changed the world, but sadly not his hair stylist]]

== The idea of mass and energy ==
Einstein's most famous equation is &lt;math&gt;E = mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Although this equation is quite well known, not many people really understand what it means.  To truly understand the significance of Einstein's work, we have to understand a few things about the history of Physics.

Before Einstein wrote down his equation, our understanding of the world was based mainly on ideas from the theories of motion and gravitation that were written down by Sir Isaac Newton&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newton.ac.uk/newtlife.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  These ideas, along with theories on heat and light that were worked out in 19th century, make up what we call Classical Physics.

Newton's theory was a powerful tool for making predictions about the positions of the planets and the trajectories of cannon balls.  In Newton's theory the motion of objects could be measured with reference to a universal reference frame that was the same for everyone, irrespective of their relative motion.  Also, time was assumed to pass at the same rate for everyone everywhere.  In addition to this, energy was thought of as something that was passed from one object to another but the mass of any particular object had nothing to do with its motion or how much energy it had.

In Einstein's theory the mass of an object is intimately connected with its energy.  In fact, mass and energy turn out to be different ways of looking at the same thing.  In Einstein's universe mass can change into energy and energy can change into mass.  Just how much energy we can get from a certain amount of mass is given by Einstein's famous formula &lt;math&gt;E=mc^2&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Dirac 3.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Paul Dirac -- the father of anti-matter, who predicted antimatter.]]

=== The Play Dough Idea ===
Imagine that something like a car, is made of play dough. Now, when you have play dough you can rip bits off and make other things out of it. Now, imagine that when the play dough is made into something, it goes hard and you have a solid object, but when it's soft, it's easy to model into other things. That's kind of like how energy works when you're talking about particles.

Basically, energy and mass are interchangeable, and anything that has mass has an energy amount, which is larger, associated with that mass. This broke free of the Newtonian ideas, as he said objects at rest have no energy associated with them.

== Particles ==

Now, you may be thinking about why particles are so important. Who cares if something super-small exists and does x, y and z ? Well, lots of people -- and you too will find it important because it describes something which is interesting because it's happening millions of times around you in a split second! 

Now, if you remember the original things were the proton, the neutron and the electron, which are what the majority of all atoms (except anti-hydrogen) are made out of. Now, you think of these being the only particles there are, but, unfortunately, there's lots of other kinds of particles which are smaller and do all kinds of crazy things! In this bit, we've got a lot to go into, but it's all very easy stuff, and if you remember one key rule, you'll be fine. 

:'''These concepts were created by humans, and are understood by them.'''

== Anti particles ==
These lovely things sound like they're straight out of ''Star Trek'', but they're nowhere near as complicated when you think about it. They're basically the '''reverse image''' of the normal particle, and have similar properties and have a similar structure, but they're the mirror image. 

Have you ever heard in maths where if you do +1 and add it with -1? Well, that's how it happens with particles and antiparticles. Now.. are you ready to get into the nitty-gritty of the particles? It's not hard, i promise you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello Npettiaux, welcome to wikibooks! 

I got your message about the matlab book, and to be honest, I am completely unconvinced that the name should be changed. Expense is hardly justification against the use of matlab, and the fact that octave is free does not necessarily make it a better value. The two programs, while they share the same core language, are very different, and matlab has a large number of features, plug-ins, addons, and toolboxes that octave simply can't match. A book dedicated to &quot;Matlab and Octave&quot;, would likely contain a small shared section about the language itself, and very large sections about the other features of matlab that don't pertain to octave. 

I would far prefer the creation of a separate &quot;Octave Programming&quot; book to a renaming of the matlab book to &quot;Matlab and Octave Programming&quot;. If you would like to create such a new book, I would certainly like to help. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

== [[Programming/LearnByExample]] ==

Please see [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Programming.2FLearnByExample]] for some ideas about how the book might be improved.  Basically they seem to want more 'commentary' or that good parts of the book are copied to other more suitable books that already exist.  As the decision by the community was 'delete' any changes would need to be made soon otherwise an Administrator may decide to delete the book as per the discussion.

== Octave Template ==

I'm going to throw together a quick template for use with octave differences. I'll create the template here: [[Template:MATLAB/Octave]]. you can insert this template into the book by typing:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{MATLAB/Octave| &lt; reason &gt; }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Where &quot;&lt; reason &gt;&quot; will be an optional explanation that you can add for clarity. Give me about 5 minutes to put it together, and check it out. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may have learnt that matter is made up out of three types of particles; protons and neutrons in the nucleus and electrons orbiting around outside.  You might think that these particles are the basic building blocks for all matter.  While it is true that the electrons cannot be broken down into any smaller particles, it ''is'' possible to smash up protons and neutrons into smaller bits.  For this reason we say that the electron is a fundamental particle and that protons and neutrons are not fundamental.

The electron belongs to the family of fundamental particles called ''Leptons''.  These small particles typically have very small masses.  The proton and the neutron belong to a family of heavier particles called ''Baryons''.


=== What makes up the proton and the neutron? ===

Protons and neutrons are made up of smaller, fundamental particles known as '''quarks'''.  Just like all of the other baryons, protons and neutrons consist of three quarks. The three quarks add together to make the baryon, so in the case of a neutron we require the charges on the quarks to cancel out.  In the case of the proton the charges must add up to give  ''e''.

To keep things simple in Particle Physics, we can call the proton charge +1 and give each quark a fractional charge as shown in the table below.

=== Explaining the properties of quarks ===

The first thing you'll be unfamiliar with is the term '''Baryon Number'''.This is a term that's basically either as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, and it's called boolean, so yes is +1 and no is 0. '''If there's an anti-particle, the number will be -1.'''

Anti-particles exist, and so do anti-quarks! They're represented with what's known as a '''bar''', which is drawn above the shorthand name, so for instance, we have &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt; for a '''u-bar''', an anti-up-quark!  So, let's look at how a proton is made of quarks! Look:

=== An example of calculating quarks ===

A proton, is made up of 3 quarks, and so is a neutron, because it's a pretty big particle in comparison to others. So, we remember from before that a proton is a '''baryon''', and it must therefore have a baryon number of +1 and a charge of +1. So, let's start off.

&lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; = Charge of +2/3 and a baryon number of 1/3. So, we add that to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; = Charge of -1/3 and a baryon number of 1/3, so we have... &lt;math&gt; +2/3 - -1/3 = +1/3&lt;/math&gt; charge and a baryon number of 2/3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; = Charge of +2/3, so we add that to the +1/3 of U + D, and we get +1 (the charge of a proton) and a baryon number of +1!

__TOC__

== Description ==

&lt;tt&gt;System'To_Address (X)&lt;/tt&gt; is a GNAT specific [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] with the same purpose of function &lt;tt&gt;System.Storage_Elements.To_Address&lt;/tt&gt;. The only difference is that it can be used in preelaborated units where non-static calls are not allowed. &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; is a value of that type &lt;tt&gt;System.Storage_Elements.Integer_Address&lt;/tt&gt; (an implementation-defined integer type), and note that this attribute is not applied to the type of &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; but always to package &lt;tt&gt;System&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Example ==

Using the standard Ada &lt;tt&gt;To_Address&lt;/tt&gt; function:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Sensor'{{Ada/attribute|Address}} use {{Ada/package|System|Storage_Elements}}.To_Address (16#0FF2_1234#);

Using the GNAT specific &lt;tt&gt;To_Address&lt;/tt&gt; attribute:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Sensor'{{Ada/attribute|Address}} use {{Ada/package|System}}'{{Ada/attribute|To_Address}} (16#0FF2_1234#);

Black's second move 2...Bc5 was reffered as &quot;Boi variation&quot; in this page, but in the wikipedia, its name is &quot;classical défence&quot;. As &quot;classical defence&quot; seems more plausible, I keep it. Thanks to indicate sources which refer to Boi variation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It might be a good idea to add an overview section to each experiment guide. There is no place where the reader can come in and see at a glance what an experiment is about. -- Jelmer



I've added a section on 'experimental equipment' because I think this is something which we will need at some point in the future. There is a lot of equipment which requires special handling, which is used in more than one experiment, so it seemed sensible to give this it's own section. To show what I mean, i've added a section on how to clean Vandegraaff machines. -- Jelmer

== Should this book continue? ==

Since the initially good idea about this wikibook on scienceshows apparently never caught on with the anticipated collaboration we hoped to have around it, the book now is in a rather unfinished and messy state. The book contains plenty of half made pages with little real information and many pages we started out making contain experiments that are not accesible without specialized equipment such as liquid nitrogen. If nobody here argues strongly in favor of keeping this book, I will start cleaning up and deleting messy pages after june 1st to leave only a few pages once I have completed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vandegraaffs are notoriously tricky devices to use, which has led to some teachers abandoning them in the classroom. However, if you keep your machine in good condition it should not give you any problems. This is a guide on how to repair a non-functioning vandegraaff machine. First, the operational mechanism will be described, then the various steps for repairing it will be explained.

This guide was written with the Frederiksen Vandergraaff in mind, but the advice given here applies equally well to other machines.

==Operational mechanism==
The vandegraaff works by separation charges via the triboelectic effect. Charge is sprayed from a metal mesh underneath the bottom roller to the belt. It is then discharged onto a second mesh on the top roller, which is inside the collector sphere. The charge is then stored on the collector sphere.

==Troubleshooting==
There are two basic things which may fail in this mechanism: either the charges are not being transported on the belt, or they are lost as fast as they are accumulated on the collector. To distinguish between these two cases, connect a wire to ground and hold it next to the belt. If you hear a hissing sound of charges going from the belt to the wire, the belt is charged. Do not touch the belt with the wire as this may damage the belt.

If there is no charge on the belt, there are again two possibilities. Either the belt is losing its charge because it is conductive, or it is not being charged at all. In the first case, the belt needs to be cleaned. In the second case, the rollers need to be cleaned, and the mesh needs to be repaired. 

If there is charge on the belt, it is being lost in the collector. In this case, the collector and supporting posts needs to be cleaned.

==Repairing the mesh==
The mesh is non-functioning if it is either touching the roller or if there are small pieces of wire sticking out above it. In either case, remove the rollers and belt, and adjust the mesh. It is very important that the mesh is a uniform distance away from the belt. Use nail clippers or precision pliers to cut the mesh to size. 

==Cleaning the rollers==
Clean the rollers by removing the rollers and belt from the machine. Remove any oil or grease which is sitting on the outside of the rollers with a leather cloth soaked in petrol. Be careful when replacing the rollers, as the ball bearings of the axle on which the roller rests are also oiled. 

==Cleaning the belt==
The most important thing about cleaning the belt is that any trace of oil and grease is removed. This can be done by cleaning the belt in turpentine or pure petrol. Use a leather rag to clean the belt, and dry it with a blow dryer afterwards. Be sure to put to blow dryer on a non-heating setting to avoid igniting the chemicals.

After the belt is cleaned in this way, powder it lightly with talcum powder, then apply the blow drier again to prevent any excess talcum powder from remaining.

==Cleaning the collector==
The collector must be absolutely free from anything which may act as a point for corona discharges - i.e. any hairs, pieces of dust, etcetera. It is important to remove these from the inside of the sphere as well! Clean the collector with a leather rag soaked in petrol.

==Cleaning the supporting posts==
The support posts are made of plastic, which means that the cannot be cleaned with alcohol. Do not use window cleaner on the support posts. Instead, clean them with a towel soaked in petrol or turpentine.

==Operational tricks==
If after this troubleshooting the VDG still doesn't work, there are a few operational tricks. First of all, try blowing hot air into the machine (especially at the mesh). If this area operates at a higher temperature it will release more charges. 

Second of all, reduce the humidity in the room. This may be done by pouring some liquid nitrogen on the floor, which will cause any water in the air to condense onto nearby surfaces.

This page includes '''comparison tables''' which can be '''big and complex'''.

While it's perfectly all right to view them in their complete state, it is recommended to install a [[User:GreyCat/Comparison tables|comparison tables extension]] that would allow to select particular columns of interest for comparison.

{{Closed|1= Looks like a &lt;span style=&quot;background:green; color:white&quot;&gt; Closed&lt;/span&gt; as '''Keep''' to me.  However I intend to remove the &quot;tranwiki&quot; tag as I see this as discouraging contributions to this book --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:37, 15 December 2006 (UTC)}}

I don't think there is any doubt in my mind that this should be deleted but there is quite a bit of content.  If you look at the history this is better served already by Wikitravel, however (in my view) the content is too great to be speedy'd.  &lt;s&gt;Delete&lt;/s&gt; neutral is my vote --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:58, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

*Yeah, I saw that too. I'd say keep though... 10,000 wikibooks on geography seems perfectly OK with me. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:25, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
**  Geography - fine, Travel - ? My view is not at all fixed tho --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:51, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

*I originally tagged it because the book had been superseded by [http://wikitravel.org/en/Isle_of_Arran]. I won't vote yet, but I'm inclined to delete it given this case. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 16:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

*&lt;strike&gt;'''Delete'''.  It's a great book and the differences between geography and travel are quite slim but people are unlikely to look on Wikibooks for a travel guide given that Wikitravel have a huge range of travel articles.  And it should probably be deleted now that Wikitravel has a good guide to the island and because no edits have been made for some time. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 19:56, 7 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/strike&gt;

** In light of recent comments I'm withdrawing my vote. Now '''Keep'''. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 12:49, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. To be fair (and terribly honest), I dont think many people are going to look on wikibooks for ''anything''. Of course, this isnt due to anything except our own lack of public noteriety (or perhaps that recognition of our project is eclipsed by the public recognition of wikipedia). The word &quot;textbook&quot;, poorly defined as it is, could certainly allow for a small book about an obscure part of scotland. The book may not be a blockbuster, but i don't think that's grounds for deletion. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:29, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I have a feeling i originally wrote this book before i found wikitravel, and after i transferred most of the contents to wikitravel forgot about it. I always thought wikibooks would be a nice place to store travel guides to places - a snap shot of an area with a history included, but i imagine this discussion has been engaged and lost a long time ago. As I was a little too close to this page i'm going to sit this vote out. [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 23:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' I only voted '''Delete''' because I thought that travel guides weren't allowed on Wikibooks.  Personally I think that Wikibooks is the ideal places for such guides (although that would therefore compete with Wikitravel). [[User:Xania|Xania]] 23:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - I don't know where this rush to push content to other Wiki projects comes from, but I would have to agree almost completely with the comment by Whiteknight above.  This book does not violate any of the established policies of Wikibooks.  The only grounds I can see to remove this book is if the original author has made a request for its deletion and there are not other substantial contributors.  If this is done better on Wikitravel, I'm glad that project is doing so well.  That still doesn't require that we move any similar books to that or any other project, particularly because it isn't a Wikimedia project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

*I'm confused about whether or not I wish to support or object the deletion. I dislike what has happened here at Wikibooks in the past, specifically the repeated forking of content to strategywiki, to wikiversity, and now it seems like at wikipedia. (More on that at another time, if you wish.) As the criteria for inclusion is stated now, ''free-content textbooks'', I really disagree with retaining this book. But the things, almost anything can be used as a textbook, especially in college classrooms. And I think the ''being created only if there exists a class given at an accredited university'' and ''designed and capable of being used therein'' metric espoused by Jimbo on the wikibooks-l mailing list is hogwash. It is so incredibly subjective and difficult to define as to render it nearly useless in discussing wikibook textbooks, except to point out its glaring subjectivity. Like I said, delete seems at first glance the only acceptable way of dealing with this, as it is not really a textbook. But since a textbook is a book used for learning in a classroom, it certainly could qualify as a textbook. Therefore it would be keep. Sigh. I don't know. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:54, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

::It's not hard for me to imagine a class in a local Scotland college that teaches about the local economy, or the local society, etc. For instance, as a Philadelphia native, I can tell you that philadelphia area colleges teach classes on philadelphia area subjects: local economy, local history, local geography, local immigration patterns, etc. This book follows in a similar vein, and I can't imagine why we would vote to delete it, except, perhaps, on grounds that this particular Island is not notable (at least not to many of the non-scotish wikibookians who have commented above). However, to the best of my knowledge, wikibooks doesnt have any notability criteria (unless we borrow from WP). Like Rob pointed out above, before the current wave of admins came in, it generally was policy to keep WMF projects ''self-contained'' in the sense that material could be freely transwikied between WMF projects, but it was not acceptable to transwiki material out of WMF projects, especially if the target location was not GFDL-based. In light of the strategy-wiki moves, I think we need to reconsider this. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

:::I am beginning to resent this inclusion metric. I know it was (I think?) suggested by Jimbo on the mailing list, and I think it has little merit. Not that I disagree with your conception of a class at a local Scotland college; I do, and am now more inclined to keep. What I dislike, however, is that has been used in the past (from what archives I have read through) as a defense for many books, but an attack upon other books. And of course, it seems the ones that were attacked most were the game guides, jokebook, et. al. I disagree with this improper, inappropriate and unfair use. It is a double standard. On the one hand, it is used for as a defense for non-game guide wikibooks which are inhernetly slightly more innocuous than game guides; on the other hand, it has been used as an attack on game-guides. The metric must either require proof for or against it, and one cannot require proof for it to qualify for inclusion in some cases and then require proof against it to qualify for deletion in other cases. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 18:28, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

This small book was created in 2005 and since then little work has been done.  Much of the information is either out-of-date, poorly-written or lacks detail.  At least one page has been tagged as work needed for quite some time.  In addition it's a travel book which never was a Wikibooks thing although we often looked the other way as there were no non-commercial alternatives.  Now, however, there is Wikivoyage so this book should either be deleted or transfered to Wikivoyage (can we transwiki to WV yet?).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:08, 15 March 2013 (UTC)

= Nimzo-Indian Defence =
===3...Bb4===
3...Bb4 introduces the Nimzo-Indian Defence. Black develops his dark-squared bishop as actively as possible and pins the white knight. If not handled properly, this pin can cause problems for White for several reasons. The most positionally significant of these is that the pin nullifies White's control of the e4 square. White would like to play e4 at some point, but Black's knight on f6 dominates the square for now, since the c3 knight cannot recapture when pinned. Consequently, Black may be able to install his knight on e4 or otherwise use the square for his own purposes if White does not fight for it.

A second implication of the pin is that Black is threatening to exchange bishop for knight and double White's pawns. The resulting position would be unbalanced, with White trying to open the position to utilize the power of his two bishops, and Black working to keep the position closed and exploit White's pawn weaknesses. White must decide how he feels about this prospect when choosing his next moves.

The Nimzo-Indian Defence is quite popular and there are a number of systems available to each side. White's fourth move options are listed below. Note that perhaps the most obvious move, 4. Bd2, breaking the pin and eliminating Black's threat to double White's pawns, is not among them. This is not because 4.Bd2 loses immediately; it does not. However, it is rarely seen in top level chess because it is far less ambitious than White's other choices.

Some pages include so-called comparison tables. They usually have a long list of features, one per row, and long list of comparable items with these features, one per column. As tables grow, new comparable items appear, and, finally, such giant table doesn't seem to fit on any screen, while usually user that references such table just wants to see 2 or 3 columns.

With comparison tables extension installed, any page that has a comparison table would have a selector with checkboxes that one can use to select which columns are of interest. Selected columns instantly appear, unselected columns instantly disappear. It's that simple. Also, you'll get rid of those yellow notice boxes.

== How to install ==

Installation is quick:
# Make sure you have a user account in Wikibooks and you're logged in.
# Add the following code into your [[Special:Mypage/vector.js|your vector.js page]]:
&lt;pre&gt;
document.write('&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;'
+ 'http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:GreyCat/comparison.js'
+ '&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript&amp;dontcountme=s&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;');
&lt;/pre&gt;
Note that if you're using skin other than default &quot;Vector&quot;, you should add this code to .js file used in your skin, i.e. use [[Special:Mypage/monobook.js|monobook.js page]] for Monobook skin, etc. You can find a full list of personal .js files for every skin in [[mw:Manual:Interface/JavaScript#Personal scripts|MediaWiki manual personal scripts description]].

== How to use this extension in pages ==

Generally, it's very simple to add this extension to any page:

# All tables that should be a comparison-enabled should have a &lt;code&gt;class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.
# Add a template &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;comparison tables&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the top of the page. It serves both as a notice for readers and as a flag that enables the extension while a reader views such page. Otherwise, the extension just does nothing and doesn't interfere with any other scripts workflow.

== Credits, support, license ==

The comparison tables extension was developed by [[User:GreyCat|GreyCat]]. Feel free to contact if any question arises.

The source code for extension is is available under [[w:GNU General Public License|GPL]] at [[User:GreyCat/comparison.js]].</text>

Black must decide whether he will take back with the c pawn : [[/5...cxd6/]] or with the e pawn : [[/5...exd6/]].

In the first case, Black will have a majority of pawns in the center, which may be useful for a later e5 push.

In the second case, the game will be more positional, relying more on the pieces placements than on the pawns fight.

The people of Korea are the descended from the ''Han'', a tribe originally from Mongolia. The name &quot;Korea&quot; is a corruption of &quot;''Goryeo''&quot;, which refers to a Dynasty that ruled Korea one thousand years ago. 

== What Country did they live in? ==
[[Image:Three_Kingdoms_of_Korea_Map.png|right|300px|thumb|The Three Kingdoms of Korea in the 5th century.]]

Korea is situated in North-East Asia, on the Korean Peninsula. It is bordered by two countries and three seas. To the northwest, the Yalu River separates Korea from China. To the northeast, the Tumen River separates Korea from Russia. The Yellow Sea is to the west; the East China Sea is to the south; and the East Sea is to the east.

== How did the civilization rise and fall? ==
There were people living on the Korean Peninsula around 700,000 years ago. The earliest known Korean pottery dates to around 8000 BC. The city and state of Gojoseon was founded in 2333 BC. [5] Archaeological and contemporary written records indicate it developed from a federation of walled cities into a centralized kingdom sometime between the 4th and 7th centuries BC. The original capital may have been somewhere near what is now the border with China. 

===The Four Kingdoms of Korea in the 5th century.=== 
The Four Kingdoms of Korea were Goguryeo, Silla, Kaya, and Baekje. They dominated the peninsula and parts of present day China. Goguryeo was the largest of the three, but was constantly at war with China. The southwestern kingdom Baekje was founded near where the capital of Korea, Seoul is today. Silla, in the southeast is believed to have been the last kingdom to develop, And Kaya, the smallest of the four kingdoms.

As time went on, Silla's gradually grew more powerful. Silla first annexed the adjacent Kaya Kingdom. In the 660s, Silla formed an alliance with the Tang Dynasty of China to conquer Baekje and later Goguryeo. Silla established the first unified state to cover most of the Korean peninsula. Silla fell apart in the late 9th century, giving way to a tumultuous period, which ended with the establishment of the Goryeo Dynasty. During the Goryeo period, laws were codified, a civil service system was introduced, and Buddhism flourished. 

In the late 14th century, the general Yi Seong-gye established the Joseon Dynasty with a largely bloodless coup. The Joseon Dynasty is believed to have been the longest-lived actively ruling dynasty in East Asia. A Joseon king, Sejong the Great, created the Korean alphabet.

== What did their buildings look like? ==

[[Image:Temple-at-gyeongju.jpg|left|thumbnail|300px|Bulguksa Temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site..]]

[[Image:Dabotap.jpeg|right|thumbnail|250px|The Pagoda of Many Treasures is an ornate pagoda carved from stone.]]

Unified Silla was a time when Korean arts flourished dramatically and Buddhism became a large part of Silla culture. Buddhist monasteries such as the Bulguksa are examples of advanced Korean architecture and Buddhist influence. State-sponsored art and architecture from this period include Hwangnyongsa Temple, Bunhwangsa Temple, and Seokguram Grotto, a World Heritage Site.

A '''pagoda''' is the general term for a tiered tower with multiple eaves. There are two famous stone pagodas at Bulguska. The older one is simple with strong square lines and flared eaves with a central spire. The newer one is known as the Pagoda of Many Treasures. It has steps leading to a square chamber formed by four carved stone pillars, above that are traditional flared eaves and an octagonal (8 sided) carved stone cupola. At Hwangnyongsa there was the largest of all ancient Korean pagodas. It towered    224 feet and nine stories tall. The base was a square 78 feet wide on each side. Hwangnyongsa was made from wood except for    the foundation which had eight stone pillars and 15 foundation stones on each side. Each story had a flared roof. There is the ruins of an ancient pagoda still standing at the Bunhwangsa temple, Bunhwangsa Pagoda. It is a square building made of cut stone brinks. At one time it was nine stories tall but it has since collapsed and is now only three stories.

== What did they eat? ==

The traditional food of Korea uses richly varied ingredients and preparation techniques, many dishes are  internationally popular today.

Korean food often has rice, vegetables, meats and tofu. Traditional Korean meals are served with many side dishes (called banchan in Korean.) Most meals are served with steamed short-grain rice.  Korean food is usually seasoned with sesame oil, doenjang (fermented soybean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger and red chili paste (gochujang). Korean food has a lot of garlic compared to other Asian foods.

One of the common side dishes is Kimchi, which is pickled, fermented, spicy vegetables. Kimchi is most commonly made from cabbage, radish or cucumber. Kimchi is traditionally eaten during winter, because it is preserved in big ceramic containers stored underground.

Korean royal cuisine, once only enjoyed by the royal court of the Joseon period, take hours and days to prepare. It must harmonize warm and cold, hot and mild, rough and soft, solid and liquid, and a balance of presentation colors. It is often served on hand-forged bronzeware or Bangjjaa. The foods are served in a specific arrangement of small dishes alternating to highlight the shape and color of the ingredients.

== What did they wear? ==
[[Image:YutSpielerinnen.jpg|right|thumbnail|300px|Hanbok, Traditional Korean Dress.]]
Hanbok or chosŏn-ot is the traditional Korean dress. It is characterized by vibrant colors and simple lines without pockets.

The upper classes wore hanbok of closely woven ramie cloth or other high-grade lightweight materials in warm weather and of plain and patterned silks the rest of the year. Commoners were restricted by law as well as resources to cotton at best. The upper classes wore a variety of colors, though bright colors were generally worn by children and young girls and subdued colors by middle-aged men and women. Commoners were restricted by law to everyday clothes of white but for special occasions they wore dull shades of pale pink, light green, gray and charcoal. Formally, when Korean men went outdoors, they were required to wear overcoat known as durumagi which comes down to knee-length.

Hanbok are classified according to their purposes: everyday dress, ceremonial dress and special dress. Ceremonial dresses are worn on formal occasions, including a child's first birthday, a wedding or a funeral. Special dresses are made for shamans and officials.

Today the hanbok is still sometimes worn during formal occasions. The everyday use of the dress, however, has been lost, with a few exceptions such as at Chunghakdong, a famous anachronistic village.

Both males and females wore their hair in a long pigtail until they were married, at which time the hair was knotted-the man’s in a topknot sangtu on the top of the head and the woman’s in a ball just above the nape of the neck. A long pin, or binyeo, was thrust through the knotted hair of the woman as both a fastener and a decoration. The material and length of the binyeo varied according to the wearer’s class and status. Men wore a gat, which also varied according to class and status. Women wore a jokduri on their wedding day, and wore an ayam for protection from the cold.

== What did their writing look like? ==

[[Image:Korean consonants.jpg|left|thumbnail|300px|Consonants.]]
[[Image:Korean vowels.jpg|left|thumbnail|300px|Vowels.]]

Korean (한국어/조선말, see below) is the official language of both North and South Korea. The language is also one of the two official languages (the other is Standard Mandarin) in neighbouring Yanbian, China. Worldwide, there are around 80 million Korean speakers, including large groups in the former Soviet Union, China, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Japan, and more recently, South Africa and the Philippines.

The genealogical classification of Korean is debated. Many linguists place it in the Altaic language family; some others consider it to be a language isolate. Korean is agglutinative in its morphology and SOV in its syntax. 
This article is mainly about the spoken Korean language. See Hangul for details on the native Korean writing system.

== What did they believe? ==

In old times Korea was heavily influenced by Buddhism.
Now, like most other countries, Korea has practitioners of several religions.
A 2005 survey showed people with no affiliation at 46%, Christian 26%, Buddhist 26%, Confucianist 1%, other 1%.

== Are some of them famous even today? ==
'''Ban Ki-moon''' ,born 13 June 1944 in Eumseong, North Chungcheong, Korea) is a South Korean former politician, 

who will succeed Kofi Annan as the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 1 January 2007.[1]
Ban was the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) from January 2004 to 1 November 2006. 
On 13 October 2006, he was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the United Nations General Assembly; he was sworn in on 14 December 2006.

[[Image:Kim_Dae-Jung_2002.jpg|left|thumbnail|300px|Kim Dae-jung during a visit of George W. Bush in Seoul, 20 February 2002.]]

'''Kim Dae-jung''' (born 6 January 1926) is a former South Korean president and the 2000 Nobel Peace Prize recipient, the first winner of a Nobel to hail from Korea [1]. A Roman Catholic since 1957, he has been called the &quot;Nelson Mandela&quot; of Asia [2] and was a symbol of democratic opposition to the dictatorial government. Kim Dae Jung was the President (succeeding Kim Young-sam) from 1998 to 2003. He was born in Haui-do, South Jeolla Province, an island off the South Korean Coast.

'''Win The Nobel Peace Prize 2000'''
&quot;for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular&quot;

== What is left of them today? ==
A civil war, known as the Korean War (1950-1953,) left Korea separated into two states. North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) is despite its name a communist state, while South Korea (Republic of Korea) became a capitalist liberal democracy and has now become one of the largest economies in the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=

Although the two-state model has directly useful applications (as we will see in binary mixtures), it is really useful as an introductory model to Statistical Mechanics.  For example, calculating entropy and other thermodynamic properties, and their meaning in certain contexts.

The two-state problem itself deals with a number of sites that can have either of two configurations:  material A or material B, up or down, 0 or 1.

To keep with a good example that has thermodynamic properties, we will choose up or down spin statistics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Say we have a material with vibrating modes visually akin to that of jello.  In other words, we are looking at the phononic modes.  The energy equation for a specific mode of a phonon is identical to that of a photon. The only difference between the phonon and photon case is that the phonon case has a possible upper limit (because the highest frequency occurs at the shortest wavelength: when one molecule is at its amplitude and the neighbours are at their troughs), and that we have another possible mode of polarization (two transverse, one longitudinal), and that we are dealing with v (the speed of sound in the material) instead of c.  Thus, when we transform the integral as in the photon derivation (another similar density of states problem) we get:

&lt;math&gt; U = \frac{3\pi}{2} \int_{0}^{n_{D}} dn \frac{n^{2} \hbar\omega_{n}}{exp(\hbar\omega_{n}/T) - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

Where n&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; is this maximal case.

We define something now called the Debye Temperature (a physical property of a material):

&lt;math&gt;\theta = (\hbar v/k_{B})(6\pi^{2}N/V)^{1/3} &lt;/math&gt;

''Note:  the k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is apparent because we've been working in energy-represented T, instead of the typical Kelvin-scaled T, k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; effectively means the T's here-on are in Kelvin-units)''

If we use this, and take the low-temperature limit of T &lt;&lt; &amp;theta;, we can approxiamated the upper limit as we continue the integration as &amp;infin; (which physically means that there's a bunch of higher-energy levels states that the solid is not reaching) we can evaluate almost exactly as before:

&lt;math&gt; U(T) = 3\pi^{4}Nk_{B}T^{4}/5\theta^{3} &lt;/math&gt;

and:

&lt;math&gt; C_{V} := \left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{V} = \frac{12\pi^{4}Nk_{B}}{5} \left(\frac{T}{\theta}\right)^{3} &lt;/math&gt;

This is known as Debye's T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; law, and follows well with experiment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As per the spin-statistics theorem, there are really only two types of particles:  fermions and bosons.  Thus if we can study each one separately fairly well, then we know quite a bit!

We will be using the grand partition function 'Infrastructure' developed earlier for these models (in order to make it even more general).  Specifically, we can use the grand partition function to create distribution functions, and use those to study specific properties of fermi/bose gases.

==The Distribution Functions==

===Fermi Gas===

Using our earlier definition:

f(&amp;epsilon;) := &lt;N(&amp;epsilon;)&gt;

Now, for a given orbital (i.e., for a given &amp;epsilon;), there can only be two options with a fermion, either there's one particle or none.  Therefore, we can use our [[Statistical Mechanics/Boltzmann and Gibbs factors and Partition functions/The Grand Partition Function | previous defined method to calculate an average quantity]] in order to calculate &lt;N(&amp;epsilon;)&gt; (we will do the sum by brute force, it's not too hard, only two terms at most):

f(&amp;epsilon;)=1/(exp((&amp;epsilon;-&amp;mu;)/kT) + 1)

===Bose Gas===

The process is the same, only instead of none or one, we have 0 to infinite.  If we use some sum relations we come up with:

f(&amp;epsilon;)=1/(exp((&amp;epsilon;-&amp;mu;)/kT) - 1)

Which is surprisingly similar to the fermi gas case, but the minus sign causes '''EXTREME''' differences in behavior compared to the fermi gas.

==The Classical Limit==

Despite overall behavior of the fermi and bose gases, in a certain limit, we see that the two distributions are nearly similar.  We call this limit 'The Classical Limit'.  In particular, this limit is:

exp((&amp;epsilon;-&amp;mu;)/kT) &gt;&gt; 1

The only importance of this limit is to determine when we don't have to worry about the two gases distinct behaviors.

==Fermi Energy==

Because of the 0 or 1 limit, at very cold temperatures (note that cold is a fairly comparative term, for the free electrons on a sheet of metals, this can be up to hundred of degrees farenheight!  Which shows that this odd quantum stuff does affect your daily life) fermi gases can only get 'locked down' to so many orbitals.  They can't all fall into the ground state.  The energy at which the gas is 'locked in' is known as the fermi energy.

In terms of the distribution function, this means at this 'cold' temperature, the function drops off sharply at one point.

==Bose-Einstein Condensation==

Unlike the fermi energy occurrence with a fermi gas, bosons can condense all they want, this is where the minus sign comes into play.  As the energy level is lower and lower, eventually they might pass the chemical potential, which causes the exponential in the bose distribution function to be less than one, and thus the function to be negative, i.e., an impossible value.  In fact, as &amp;epsilon; approaches &amp;mu;, the function approaches a singularity.  Physically, this means that all the bosons can 'condense' into the same low energy spot at low temperatures:  a phenomena known as boson condensation.

==CALCULATING ENTHALPY CHANGES==

===Atomisation enthalpy and bond dissociation enthalpy===

The enthalpy change for a chemical reaction can be deduced from consideration of the energy required to break bonds in the reactants and the energy released when the bonds in the products are formed. 

By considering the relationship H = Ea(forward) - Ea(reverse)
The enthalpy change for a chemical reaction can be calculated from the following equation:

H = Energy required to break bonds in reactants - Energy required to break bonds in products.
Or H = ΣHb(bonds broken) - ΣHb(bonds formed)

The energy required to separate all the bonds in an element or a compound is known as the atomisation enthalpy. It is defined slightly differently for elements and compounds.

The atomisation enthalpy of an element is the energy required to produce one mole of free gaseous atoms of that element.
	Eg Na(s)  Na(g) or 1/2Cl2(g)  Cl(g)

The atomisation enthalpy of a compound is the energy required to convert one mole of a compound into its free gaseous atoms.
	Eg CH4(g)  C(g) + 4H(g)

In gas phase reactions, the bonds which are broken and formed are covalent bonds. The energy required to separate completely the atoms in one mole of covalent bonds is known as the bond dissociation enthalpy of that bond (Hb).

A-B(g)  A(g) + B(g)

Bond	H /kJmol-1
C-H	+413
O-H	+464
C-C	+347
C=C	+612
C=O	+805
H-F	+568
H-Cl	+432
Cl-Cl	+243
Br-Br	+193
O=O	+498

These bond enthalpies are mean values; the exact strength of a bond depends on its environment. Thus bond enthalpies calculated from different reactions may vary slightly.

===Calculating approximate energy changes===

The approximate H of any reaction can be calculated, given bond dissociation enthalpies and atomisation enthalpies:

Eg Calculate the approximate energy change for the reaction:

CH4(g) + 2O2(g)  CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)

Bonds broken: 4 x C-H, 2 x 0=0
Energy required = 4(413) + 2(498) = 2648 kJmol-1

Bonds formed: 2 x C=O, 4 x O-H
Energy released = 2(803), 4(464) = 3462 kJmol-1

Energy change = 2648 – 3462 = -815 kJmol-1

N.B Because the values used are mean bond energies, these calculations are only approximate. The value of the bond strengths in the substances involved in the reaction will be different from the mean values. 

Calculations based on Hess’ Law do not rely on such approximations and so are more reliable.
 
==FORMATION OF IONIC COMPOUNDS==

The enthalpy changes during reactions involving covalent compounds can be explained in terms of simple bond breaking and bond making:

H = (bonds broken) - (bonds formed)

Reactions involving ionic compounds, however, involve a more complex sequence of processes and must be treated by a different method. Reactions involving the formation of ionic compounds from their elements can be broken down into three stages:
-	formation of free gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states.
-	addition or removal of electrons to form ions.
-	attraction of the ions to form the ionic compound.

Consider the reaction Na(s) + 1/2Cl2(g)  NaCl(s)

a) Formation of free gaseous atoms from the elements in their standard states.

The enthalpy changes required to form free gaseous atoms can be obtained from the atomisation enthalpies or the bond dissociation enthalpies.

b) Formation of the ions from free gaseous atoms

The first ionisation energy of an atom is the energy required to remove one electron from each of a mole of free gaseous atoms of that element.
Eg Na(g)  Na+(g) + e

The first electron affinity of an atom is the energy change when one electron is added to each of a mole of free gaseous atoms of that element.
Eg Cl(g) + e  Cl-(g)

In cases where the ions have a charge of +2 or -2, other electrons must be transferred:

The second ionisation energy of an element is the energy required to remove one electron from each of a mole of free gaseous unipositive ions of that element:

Eg Mg+(g)  Mg2+(g) + e

The second electron affinity of an atom is the energy change when one electron is added to each of a mole of free gaseous uninegative ions of that element.

Eg O-(g) + e  O2-(g)

c) Attraction of the ions to form an ionic compound

The lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound is the energy released when one mole of the compound is formed from its free gaseous ions under standard conditions.

Eg Na+(g) + Cl-(g)  NaCl(s)

The formation of sodium chloride from sodium and chlorine thus consists of the following five processes:

Process	Equation	Enthalpy change/ kJmol-1
Atomisation enthalpy of sodium	Na(s)  Na(g)	+107
Atomisation enthalpy of chlorine	1/2Cl2(g)  Cl(g)	+122
First ionisation energy of sodium	Na(g)  Na+(g) + e	+496
First electron affinity of chlorine	Cl(g) + e  Cl-(g)	-348
Lattice energy of sodium chloride	Na+(g) + Cl-(g)  NaCl(s)	-780

Atomisation enthalpies and ionisation enthalpies are always positive (ie endothermic). First electron affinities (usually) and lattice enthalpies are negative (ie exothermic).

The sequence of processes making up the formation of an ionic compound can be shown as an energetic cycle known as a Born-Haber cycle:
 
 

The enthalpy of formation of NaCl can be calculated from Hess' Law:

Hf(NaCl) = +107 + 122 + 496 + (-348) + (-780) = -403 kJmol-1.

Born-Haber cycles can be used to calculate any of the above processes if all the others are known. In practice it is usually used to calculate the electron affinity or the lattice enthalpy, since these are difficult processes to measure directly.
 

==DISSOLVING IONIC COMPOUNDS==

Ions are strongly attracted to water, since water is a polar molecule and so cations are attracted to the O atoms in water and anions are attracted to H atoms:

The energy released when a gaseous ion is dissolved in water is known as the hydration enthalpy of the ion:
Mx+(g)  Mx+(aq)

Not all ionic compounds are soluble, however, since the ions in the solid state are also attracted to each other (cf lattice energy). The energy required to break up an ionic lattice is known as the lattice dissociation enthalpy.

The enthalpy change when one mole of an ionic compound dissolves in excess water is known as the enthalpy of solution. The more exothermic the enthalpy of solution, the more likely the compound is to dissolve.

Eg NaCl(s)  NaCl(aq)


 

The hydration energy depends on the charge and the size of the ions: the larger the charge and the smaller the size, the larger the hydration energy.

Ion	Na+	K+	Mg2+	Ca2+	Cl-	Br-
Hydration energy/kJmol-1	-406	-322	-1920	-1650	-364	-337

.Solubility of ionic compounds in water thus varies widely, and depends on the balance between the hydration energy of the ions and the lattice energy of the compound. Most ionic compounds are at least partially soluble in water.
 

The solubility of ionic compounds can be calculated using the lattice energy of the compound and the hydration energy of the ions according to the following Hess' Law cycle:

∆H(solution) = Σ(∆H(hydration)) - ∆H(lattice formation)

or

∆H(solution) = Σ(∆H(hydration))+ ∆H(lattice dissociation)

eg for sodium chloride:
lattice dissociation enthalpy of NaCl: +780 kJmol-1
hydration enthalpy of sodium ion: -406 kJmol-1
hydration enthalpy of chloride ion: -364 kJmol-1

enthalpy of solution of NaCl = 780 – 406 – 364 = +10 kJmol-1

The greater the lattice energy, the harder it is to separate the ions and the lower the solubility. The greater the hydration energy, the greater the energy released when the ions dissolve in water and the greater the solubility.
 
==SPONTANEOUS REACTIONS==


It is often cited that reactions take place in order that the substances can become more stable (i.e. lower their potential energy). This is what happens during exothermic reactions. However this cannot be reconciled with the fact that many endothermic reactions proceed readily under normal conditions.

Two common endothermic reactions are:
NH4Cl(s) NH4Cl(aq) at room temperature
CaCO3(s)  CaO(s) + CO2(g) at temperatures above 1000oC

It follows that there must be other factors, other than the enthalpy change, which determine whether or not a reaction will proceed spontaneously; the enthalpy change is important but not the only factor.

==ENTROPY==

The other factor which determines whether or not a reaction will take place is the change in entropy.

Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder of a system.

 A high degree of disorder makes a substance more stable.

Eg entropy increases solids &lt; liquids &lt; gases
Generally metals have a higher entropy than non-metallic solids

Typical entropy values are:

Substance	Entropy/ Jmol-1K-1
Diamond	2.4
Graphite	5.7
Aluminium	28.3
Water	69.9
Carbon monoxide	197.6
Carbon dioxide	213.6
Argon	154.7

It is possible to calculate the entropy change for a reaction by applying the formula:

S = Sproducts - Sreactants

eg Calculate the entropy change for the reaction C(s) + CO2(g)  2CO(g)

∆S = 2(197.6) – 213.6 – 5.7 = 175.9 Jmol-1K-1
 

If ∆S is +ve then a reaction is likely.
If ∆S is –ve then a reaction is unlikely.
Chemical reactions are favoured if they are accompanied by an increase in entropy.

Many endothermic reactions proceed spontaneously under normal conditions because there is an increase in entropy. Some exothermic reactions do not proceed spontaneously because there is a decrease in entropy.

==FREE ENERGY==

Whether or not a reaction will proceed thus depends on a balance between entropy and enthalpy. These two quantities combine to give a single term, known as free energy. The change in free energy of a reaction is the ultimate test of whether it will proceed. 

∆G = ∆H - T∆S

∆G = change in free energy
∆H = change in enthalpy
∆S = change in entropy

If ∆G = -ve, the reaction will proceed, even if ∆H = +ve (though it may be very slow if the reactants have kinetic stability).

If ∆G = +ve, the reaction will not proceed, even if ∆H = -ve.

So enthalpy changes in chemical reactions are useful, but they cannot be used to predict whether or not a reaction will take place.

==CRITICAL TEMPERATURE==

Because the free energy change ∆G depends on T∆S, the effect of entropy becomes more important at higher temperatures.

If ∆H is –ve and ∆S is positive, the reaction will be spontaneous at all temperatures.
If ∆H is +ve and ∆S is negative, the reaction will not be spontaneous at any temperature.

However if ∆H and ∆S are both +ve, the reaction will be spontaneous only above a certain temperature. If ∆H and ∆S are both –ve, the reaction will be spontaneous only below a certain temperature.

The critical temperature is the temperature at which ∆G = 0, so ∆H = T∆S.

T = ∆H/∆S

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Clausius-Clapeyron Equation==

In equilibrium, we know that the first-derivative of thermodynamic quantities of two systems should be equal, for this specifies a maxima or minima of the original thermodynamic function.  In terms of phases, the best variable to examine is &amp;mu;, specifically for when a gas and liquid phase of a system coexist:

&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;(p,T) = &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;(p,T)

Also, because we are examining a physical continuous system:

&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;(p + dp,T + dT) ~= &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;(p + dp,T + dT)

If we take these and play around with them using a Taylor's expanaion, limiting dp and dT small enough that higher order terms fall out, and play with them algebraically:

dp/dT = ((&amp;part;&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;/&amp;part;T)&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - (&amp;part;&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/&amp;part;T)&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)/((&amp;part;&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;/&amp;part;p)&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; - (&amp;part;&amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;/&amp;part;p)&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;)

Using some Maxwell relations and the fact that for a single-specie system G=N&amp;mu;(p,t) (in order to satisfy G's differential equation) we can obtain:

dp/dT=(s&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; - s&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;)/(v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; - v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;)

But if we make the following definitions:

L := T(s&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; - s&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;)

&amp;Delta;v= = (v&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; - v&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;)

dp/dT=L/(T&amp;Delta;v)

which is know as the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which tells the form of the vapor-pressure line where the gas and liquid phases of a material meet.

==Maxwell Construction==

Another way of looking at the phase transition point is to examine the Gibbs free energy.  There is a free energy curve for the material for each of its phases.  What phase it's in is determined by the curve with the lowest free energy (as said in the previous chapter).  Therefore, the place of coexistance is where G&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=G&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;.

Let's take a look at Gibbs' differential form:

&lt;math&gt;dG = -S dT + V dp + \mu dN&lt;/math&gt;

N=1 and is constant, and let's assume T is constant, then:

dG= Vdp

Integrate over the curve so that:

G&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; - G&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;int;Vdp

But since we are at a phase equilibrium position:

&amp;int;Vdp = 0

over such a curve for a material.  This relation allows us to determine something called the 'coexistance line' on a P-V diagram, and is known as Maxwell's Construction.

:Decent thought. On wikimedia channels, it is generally forbidden to publish logs of discussions, so I doubt we can use direct copy+paste excerpts. On another note, the next issue could certainly contain reminders about the IRC channel and the mailing list, including a link to sign up for the mailing lists. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

::Well, I didn't mean transcriptions, just a summary of what's discussed in general terms. For example, we could sum up last night's discussion as &quot;the good and the bad of many specific policies vs. a few very broad policies&quot;.

== Question on scope of the newsletter's audience ==

I was just curious about something. You said that 60 people received the newsletter. This seemed a little low to me, so it made me curious. What were the criteria for sending the newsletter to people? Because I think that the criteria for being an &quot;established contributor&quot; and thus receiving the newsletter may have been too stringent, i.e. the information contained in it could have been just as useful to people who made 20 contributions in the last month as it was to those who made 100. It was mentioned that the purpose is to reach out to people who are active in contributions but not in the community, but how active do we want people to be in contributing before we encourage them to become part of the community? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 15:25, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
:You are right about this.  The problem was getting a list of &quot;active&quot; WB folk.  A number of us put together the list and inevitably we will have missed some people who would have benefited.  However do bear in mind that many accounts are created and never used (or only once or twice for a specific purpose).  I guess the &quot;criteria&quot; was effectively that we noticed them or they noticed the page.  Do you have ideas for getting to more (&amp; relevant) folk - if so it would be great to hear - I'm sure another bot run would be no problem?
:I guess also was it any use to you?!  Regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:43, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

::The problem is that we are literally having 100 or more new user accounts created per day around here, and most of these accounts are never used, or (as herby has already mentioned) are only used once or twice with no intent to return. The number &quot;60&quot; may sound surprisingly low, but if you do follow the RC lists and you do look at the people who are actually contributing, I think you would be hard pressed to even find 60 people who are contributing. Some of the people who were on that list are known wikibookians, but aren't even active here anymore. To be on this list, somebody must either have noticed the user being active (i've added people that I've seen on the RC list), or that person must have been involved enough to actually find that page and add their names out to it. I am not going to support blindly sending out that newsletter to every account, or even every account that was created recently. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

::::Excellent Idea!! Question, is there any other such notice that we could use besides [[MediaWiki:Sitenotice]] to send that information out to all wikibookians? --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:33, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

::: (after edit conflict) I don't expect you to send it out to every account, as I agree that a lot of accounts go unused, are abandoned after some time, and so on. If you were doing it by hand, then that would explain the numbers. I do think that it would probably be best to do it based on number of recent contributions (if this is possible), though I would not want to venture a guess as to what limit we would want to use, maybe 5? Is there some sort of bot out there that can give you such a list? I think it would probably be useful for other purposes as well, does wikipedia have a newsletter like this? Maybe we could ask the people there what they do, since they have a lot more active contributors and therefore probably have a bot set up (unless they just send it to everyone) Other than that, putting it on sitenotice seems like a really good idea to me as well. And yes the newsletter was useful to me, I hadn't noticed the bulletin board before, and it's always nice to get a message in your talk page anyways.

== Next steps? ==

Reflecting on the above - maybe
# Add to the welcome template a &quot;sign up here&quot; for the Gazette?
# However could some clever person make a user friendly sign up box - not sure the page would be easily understandable to a newbie?
# How often will it go out - while I am not after a regular time frame the idea that it would be less than every 1/2 months would probably mean it was going off the boil?
# Start some outline ideas [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks Gazette 2]] if that was the naming idea tho I see some thoughts at the bottom of the first one

: 1 Sounds good to me.
: 2 Maybe we could have all of them just sign a blank page or something, put a message on the top that says &quot;sign your name with four tildas (~) on this page if you would like to receive the Wikibooks gazette&quot; or something like that, is there any need to really have a sign-up &quot;box&quot;? (I'm not sure, is this the only reliable way to pass information into the bot?)
: 3 I don't know how I feel about that, maybe a regular time frame would be better just to prevent the need to decide something like &quot;Such and such policy decision is important enough that we need to make a new newsletter to tell people about it but this isn't&quot;. Then again, such a decision would have to be made anyways as to what to include when the time came around to make a new one. I think maybe we should have a maximum time between issues (like, say, a month, or a half a month if you think a month is too long) but if something that is deemed important enough comes along, we can put an issue out before then to inform people of it. That way, we can still remind/pester people once a month or so to get their votes out on important topics, but still have the flexibility to print on new debates and such. Then again new things might crop up often enough that such a plan would not be necessary or beneficial, I think the people who have been here longer would know better than I how often new things come up that it would help to print. 
: 4 Do you mean the graphical design or the actual contents of the newsletter? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 18:08, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

::Your 2 - not my speciality, hopefully others better at it will pass
::Your 3 - I think I agree with you - on the basis of need - however if they are too far apart/too frequent we will loose people
::Your 4 - again not a strong point (graphics) BUT we could introduce fold to the new logo?  Not sure when it becomes active? I was after more content/changes to tone etc if required? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:11, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

::: I think the tone's OK but am not sure about the content itself. I know this issue was the first and was therefore made very general on purpose. Just for the sake of argument, rather than saying general stuff like 'make sure you put the bulletin board on watch', I think it'd be better to state some of the important things that're being discussed, and then simply refer them to those pages for further details and to debate those topics. I think a while ago, someone on the staff lounge brought up the point that it's often kind of confusing to track what's going on because it's on a whole bunch of different pages, and things tend to get lost in the woodwork somewhat. This newsletter could help to coordinate all of that, to say, oh yeah we have this lively debate going on on the [[wikibooks:Votes for deletion|vfd]] page concerning the validity of video game textbooks, or something like that. Other than that, not sure what you mean by introducing a fold to the new logo, I have seen some candidates for the new logo (honestly I'm not really sure what's wrong with the one we have but a redesign is always nice once in a while), do you mean you want to kind of make a blown up version of it and put the newsletter text inside it? Something like that could ''maybe'' work, but I haven't really seen anything like it on wiki sites so I'm not sure if it would work (and I don't have the technical knowhow to try and do something like that). [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 04:57, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

::::Firstly oops!  FF2's spell checker only helps some of my blunders - try &quot;folk&quot; instead of &quot;fold&quot;, could make reading it easier!  I guess I was just suggesting it as a &quot;header&quot; so that people were made aware of it?

::::As far as your point about content is concerned I am completely with you.  To encourage at least some dedicated editors of individual topics to look at [[WB:VFD]]s and [[WB:RFA]]s for example would certainly be an aim of mine.  Really quite a select bunch are involved in most of the voting on both pages (no disrespect to them at all) - can almost be a case of &quot;you can close it because everyone has had their say&quot; - widening democracy a little would (IMO) be good.  Equally (tho a little less my thing) current policy voting should include as much of the community as possible (if you missed it anywhere that was the idea of the Gazette to work on &quot;community&quot;) --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:::::As to the frequency issue, I firmly believe that we shouldnt be sending out newsletters when we don't have news to tell. I dont think it needs to be sent with any regulariy, and I would prefer to send it too infrequently as opposed to too infrequently. We don't want people to dread the day the newsletter comes because it takes up so much space in their user talk page. 
:::::On another note, I think that every issue should contain some basic reminders: watch the bulletin board, participage in RFA and VFD, and ask questions at the staff lounge. Beyond that, we have about 2 or 3 solid paragraphs for actual news that we can report. 
:::::The text at the bottom of the page are my quick notes for the next newsletter. The first section can be archived in whatever manner we've decided to archive these things. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:25, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

* (reset) I do think it would get annoying if we sent the newsletter out too often, you have a point there. If I understand you correctly, your stance is that there is no need for us to define &quot;often enough&quot;, I'm not sure if I agree with that but with the amount of changes that are happening in wikibooks right now I think that there'll be plenty of news to keep the newsletter active anyways so the argument is moot. I also agree that the reminders are useful (especially for those who have not yet received a copy of the newsletter before), I was just saying I think they should be just that, quick reminders, not the focus of the newsletter. Another thing to consider is is the actual writing of the newsletter going to be a community project (i.e. if someone has something they want to bring up could they add it to the newsletter itself)? This may or may not be a good idea, depending on what the goals are, I mean if it's made into a community endeavor we may have more news but also will probably have a more bloated newsletter. Thoughts? Finally, I looked at the suggestions for next issue, looks good to me, are there any particular conversations in the staff lounge / vfd / rfa that you'd like to bring up in the newsletter? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 15:24, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:I know I get impatient at times (!) but I'm offline until tomorrow now but I will get back on this one then.  However my understanding is that we all can and should edit if we have something to say (as with all things Wiki).  Maybe there is a semi static header &amp; footer but harvesting staff lounge/RfA/VfD for current issues makes much sense.  Maybe aiming for the next one mid/end Jan?  I'll arc the old one tomorrow maybe.
:A concern of mine tho is ensuring that we do catch as many active folk as possible - I'd hate people to feel left out (the opposite of what we are trying to achieve), equally spamming unused accounts would be counter productive.

::You both bring up good points, Herby and Matt. First off, as this is a wiki, I do believe that we should write the newletter as a community (that doesnt mean everybody adds whatever they want, but that we have to agree or mostly agree on the content). Second, the primary place for listing news should always be the bulletin board. People should add their news to the bulletin board, and a distilled version of that should become the newsletter (with the addition of some static reminders to watch the bulletin board, etc). As for frequency, I still believe that we should send it when we have enough news to tell, and not send it otherwise. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:44, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

'''Witch-hazel''' (''Hamamelis'') is a genus of four species of flowering plants in the family Hamamelidaceae, with two species in North America (''H. virginiana'' and ''H. vernalis''), and one each in Japan (''H. japonica'') and China (''H. mollis''). They are popular ornamental plants, grown for their clusters of rich yellow to orange-red flowers which begin to expand in the autumn as or slightly before the leaves fall, and continue throughout the winter. Numerous cultivars have been selected for use as garden shrubs, many of them derived from the hybrid ''H. × intermedia'' Rehder (''H. japonica'' × ''H. mollis'').

The Parrotia, a closely related tree formerly treated as ''Hamamelis persica'', is now given a genus of its own, as ''Parrotia persica'', as it differs in the flowers not having petals. Other closely allied genera are ''Parrotiopsis'', ''Fothergilla'' and ''Sycopsis'' (see under Hamamelidaceae). Witch-hazels are not closely related to the hazels.

''Hamamelis'' species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Feathered Thorn.

==Description==
They are deciduous shrubs or (rarely) small trees growing to 3-8 m tall, rarely to 12 m tall, with gray bark that varies from smooth to warty in texture. The leaves are alternately arranged, oval, 4-16 cm long and 3-11 cm broad, with a smooth or wavy margin. Winter vegetative buds are foliose, floral buds on short stalks, opening slightly several weeks before fully blooming. The flowers have four slender, strap-shaped petals 1-2 cm long, pale to dark yellow, orange, or red. The fruit is a two-parted capsule 1 cm long with two &quot;beaks&quot; at the tip of each half, containing a single 5 mm glossy black seed in each of the two parts; the capsule splits explosively at maturity in the autumn about 8 months after flowering; the seeds are ejected with sufficient force to fly for distances of up to 10 m.

==Ecology==
Flowers of the winter-blooming species are visited by many insects, including bumblebees, and so can serve as an important nectar source at that time of year.

==Culture and Use==
Witch hazels grow best in full sun, but tolerate considerable shade. Deep, fertile, well-drained soils are best, but they are quite adamptable. 

Witch hazels should not be pruned in mid to late winter, as they bleed copiously and the plant may become desiccated.

On many plants, the leaves fail to fall off the plant in autumn, and may need to be cut off with scissors since the dark brown dead leaves detract from the flower display of winter-blooming types.

The bark and leaves are astringent, the extract, also referred to as Witch Hazel, is used medicinally. Extracts from its bark and leaves are used in aftershave lotions and lotions for treating bruises. The seeds contain a quantity of oil and are edible.

Usually, White plays [[/3. Nf3/]] to avoid Qh4+ and to support the remaining pawn. Otherwise, [[/3. Bc4/]] is the main alternative.

== Ingredients ==

* &amp;frac12; pint of Guinness stout
* 1&amp;nbsp;oz Jameson Irish whiskey
* 1&amp;nbsp;oz [[Bartending/Alcohol/Cream liqueur#Irish Cream|Baileys Irish Cream]]

== Glasses ==
[[Image:Pint Glass (Pub).svg|left|25px|]]
* [[Bartending/Glassware#Pint|Pint glass]]
[[Image:Shot Glass (Standard).svg|left|25px|]]
&lt;br&gt;
* [[Bartending/Glassware#Shot|Shot glass]]
&lt;br&gt;

==Procedure==

#Pour Guinness into the pint glass. 
#Pour Baileys into the shot glass and, without mixing, pour Jameson into the shot glass. 
#When ready to drink, drop the shot glass into the pint, and be mindful of spilling.

== Notes ==
* When the Baileys mixes with the beer it will begin to curdle very quickly, requiring the drink to be consumed promptly.
* It is sometimes considered improper to order this drink in an Irish establishment. Some United States bars refuse to sell it, and it is not sold in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/food-drink/us-bars-slammed-for-serving-irish-car-bomb-drink-97791774-237703371.html US bars slammed for serving ‘Irish car bomb’ drink] Irish Central, 2010-07-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek gods transferred to the Roman civilization, but came through with various changes and differences. Their status changed and so did their various attributes. This section of the Mythology wikibook is devoted to the Roman Gods of old.

__TOC__

==Safety==

===Safety Class===

*Very dangerous (Should only be attempted after careful training)

===Required Safety Equipment===

*The show performer: Glasses / Cryogenic gloves

*Audience/participants: None.

==Materials==

*One brass tube, 5cm across, 40 cm high. This brass tube is closed on one end and open on the other.
*One cork with two holes in it which fits on the brass tube
*Two glass tubes which fit into the holes in the cork, 40cm long
*Liquid nitrogen
*Water
*A stable table

==Procedure==

Preparation: Stick the glass tubes into the cork. Make sure the glass tubes stick out about 5 cm above the cork. 

Put on safety goggles and cryogenic gloves.

Put some water onto the table, and put the tube in this - with the closed side down. Pour the liquid nitrogen into the tube. Now put the cork with the glass tubes down into the brass tube. This will cause a massive fountain of liquid nitrogen to squirt out of the glass tubes. 

The waste product (liquid nitrogen) will evaporate into the air. 

===Dangers===

*Be sure to always wear gloves and glasses when doing this experiment
*Be sure to NEVER do this experiment twice in a row, while the equipment is still cold. If the equipment is still cold, the lower temperature difference will cause the liquid nitrogen to evaporate slower. This means that you get liquid nitrogen sprayed all over you!
*Keep your head below the tube when doing this experiment. Liquid nitrogen which lands in your neck is less dangerous than liquid nitrogen which lands in your face

===Other Factors===

As said above, the higher the temperature difference between the equipment and the liquid nitrogen, the larger the effect. Therefore, it is possible to increase the effect of this experiment by heating the equipment with a blow drier beforehand. 

===Show notes===

It is very important that you need two people to do this experiment; one pours the liquid nitrogen into the fountain tube, the other one puts the cork on. If you try to do both by yourself, so much liquid nitrogen will have evaporated that the effect will be much less.

==Explanation==

===What's taking place===

The liquid nitrogen evaporates, creating more pressure in the tube. Because the glass tubes are below the waterline of the liquid nitrogen, the liquid nitrogen is pushed out instead of the gas. 

===In the real world===

Espresso machines work like this; steam is built up in a chamber, and the boiling liquid is pushed through coffee powder.

==More Information==

*[http://end.net Websites with more info] the end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Jelmer

In the wiki science show book, maybe my idea about assmbling all guides under scienceshow/guides is too cumbersome, but then I think we should find a general way  for structuring it. Some of the pages you suggest are already under /guides - which is why i'd like to have a general index, instead of scattering them on several pages... what would you suggest?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Bookify}}

This article concerns itself with the game theory and optimal '''strategy''' for playing the popular television game show, '''''Deal or No Deal'''''. 

One basic strategy is for a contestant to act so as to maximize the expected value of his prize.  At each point in the game where the banker makes an offer, the contestant can maximize his expected value by choosing the offer if it is greater than the average value of the unopened cases and declining it when it is less.  However, the offers from the banker almost never exceed the average value of the unopened cases.  Thus, if contestants always chose this strategy, the game would be boring as it would consist of contestants always declining offers and continuing to open cases until the end (or until the banker's offer exceeds expected value).

However, the game becomes interesting when other strategies that involve optimizing for parameters beyond expected value.  A contestant who declines the banker's offer is accepting the risk that he may win less than that offer. Different people have different degrees of risk tolerance.  For instance, if offered the choice between getting $400,000 against taking an even chance of winning either $1 or $1,000,000 many contestants would prefer to accept the $400,000 despite that fact that if one's strategy was simply to maximize the expected value, the contestant should reject the offer. The reason why many contestants would accept the $400,000 is due to the fact that people maximize their utility of money and not the expected value directly. The utility of money diminishes as a person gains more money, for example the utility of the first $400,000 the contestant receives may be worth much more than the next $600,000 received.

The game's deceptively simple format has attracted attention from mathematicians, statisticians, and economists as a study of decision making under risk: It is an excellent instructive example of the application of ''utility theory''. In 2004, a team of economists played a scaled-down version of the game with 84 participants and compared the results with the expected utility hypothesis. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | author=Post, Van den Assem, Baltussen, and Thaler | title=''Deal or No Deal''? Decision Making Under Risk in a Large-payoff Game Show|date=December 2004 | url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=636508}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study received a great deal of media attention, appearing on the front page of ''The Wall Street Journal'' on January 12, 2006 as well as being featured on National Public Radio in the United States on March 3, 2006.

==Modeling strategy==

At the start of a standard game of the U.S. version of ''Deal or No Deal'', the expected value of the game is $131,477.54, the average of the 26 cases.  However only 6 of the 26 cases have values greater than the expected value, and the median value of the 26 cases is only $875.  Before any deal is offered, the contestant must select 6 cases to be eliminated.  Thus the expected value of the cases at the time of the first offer could range from a low of $13,420.80 to a high of $170,916.25 and the median value from a low of $350 to a high of $17,500, leading to considerable variability in playing conditions by the time players must first make decisions in the game.

===The banker's perspective===
One should not consider only the perspective of the contestant who wins the prize, as this is a two player game, with the banker being the other player.  Because the banker plays a large number of games, which greatly reduces his risk, he can be extremely tolerant of the remaining risk and adopt a strategy that seeks to minimize the expected value of the prizes that contestants win.  However, the expected value he seeks to minimize is not on a per game basis, as is the case for the contestant, but on a per hour of play basis.  A strategy that would cause an average contestant to play for an hour and win $100,000, is more advantageous to the banker than a strategy that would cause an average contestant to play for only a quarter hour and win $50,000.  This helps to explain why the banker's first few offers are only a small fraction of the expected value of the remaining cases.  An optimal banker will only make offers that from his perspective improve upon the expected value per hour of play.  From the contestant's perspective this becomes a premium he must pay to end the game early.

===The contestant's perspective===
Typically a contestant enters the game with an idea of what he considers to be a minimum satisfactory prize.  So long as the contestant can continue the game without significant risk of knocking out all of the prizes above that minimum, he will do so.  What the contestant considers satisfactory may change during the game as the remaining prizes change.  For example, when the second most valuable prize remaining is $75,000, a contestant will be more satisfied with the risk that it could become the most valuable remaining prize, if the current most valuable remaining prize is $100,000 than if it were $1,000,000.  Thus a player is likely to desire to continue playing while the risk is low.  By the time of the fourth offer there are eight remaining cases.  At this point in the game there is only a 4.8% chance that the contestant will have eliminated all of the prizes worth $100,000 or more, and a 72.8% chance that there will be at least two such prizes still in the game.  Hence a contestant is also unlikely to accept an early offer.

===End game===
The desirability of continuing the game diminishes for both players as the number of prizes satisfactory to the contestant remaining in the game diminish.  With fewer prizes that the contestant considers satisfactory remaining, the risk to the contestant increases.  This increased risk lowers the percentage of the estimated value of the remaining cases that an offered deal needs to be attractive to the contestant.  Conversely, the banker, since he is trying to also optimize the entertainment value of the game, may need to end a game quickly if the values of the remaining cases are all small.  To end the game he needs to increase the percentage of the estimated value of the remaining cases that he offers for a deal, occasionally even above the estimated value.

==Comparison with the Monty Hall problem==

When only three cases remain, ''Deal or No Deal'' might seem like a version of the [[w:Monty Hall problem|Monty Hall problem]].  Consider a ''Deal or No Deal'' game with three cases (similar to the three doors in the Monty Hall problem).  The contestant has one case.  Then, one of the two other cases is opened.  Finally, the contestant is given the option to trade his or her case for the one unopened case remaining.  


The Monty Hall problem gives the contestant a 2/3 chance of winning with a switch and a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping his or her case.    However, there is a critical difference between ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' and ''Deal or No Deal''.  In the Monty Hall problem, the host has used his secret knowledge of what lies behind each of the three doors to cause a bad choice to always be revealed.  This non-random selection of a bad choice is what causes the difference in odds of winning between switching and not switching on ''Let's Make a Deal''. This causes ''Let's Make a Deal'' to behave like the Ignorant Monty Hall problem.

==Analyzing decision making under risk==
A team of economists - Post, Van den Assem, Baltussen &amp; Thaler ([http://ssrn.com/abstract=636508 report]) - have analyzed the decisions of people appearing in ''Deal or No Deal'' and found, among other things, that contestants are less risk averse when they have seen their expected winnings tumble. &quot;Losers&quot; tend to continue playing the game even if this means rejecting bank offers in excess of the average of the remaining prizes. A separate experimental study ([http://ssrn.com/abstract=923607 report]) with student-subjects playing the game with scaled down prizes reveals a similar pattern. The findings provide support for behavioral economists, who claim that the classical expected utility theory falls short in explaining human behavior by not accounting for the context of decisions. The study of the four economists is unique, for the underlying &quot;experiment&quot; ''Deal or No Deal'' is characterized by high stakes, a transparent probability distribution and only simple stop-go decisions that require minimal skill or strategy.

This particular study recently attracted some media attention in the United States, including coverage on the front page of the ''Wall Street Journal'', January 12, 2006, and National Public Radio, March 3, 2006.

It's tempting for Black to play [[/2...b5/]] but it's a trap : 3. Bxf7+ Kxf7 4. Qh5+!. If now 4. ... Kf6?? then 5. Qf5++, 4. ... Ke6?? transposes to the same line after 5. Qd5+ Kf6 6. Qf5++ checkmate. The only evasion of mate is 4. ... g6 5. Qd5+ any 6. Qxa8 and White wins a rook.

Instead, [[/2...e6/]] is sound. 2. Nf6 is good too : 3. e5 d5

Development keeps going. Black should now play [[/3...Bb7/]], putting pressure on the e pawn (remember that White cannot play Nc3 to protect the pawn !). [[/3...e6/]] can also be played (and will anyway be played at some point in the opening), but why giving White more liberty when it's possible to force the following moves ?

= St. George Defence =
===2. c4===
At first sight, it looks like a refutation of St Georges Defence. But Black keeps the powerful ability to play [[/2...e5/]], transposing into an open game where White have a misplaced pawn on c4.

[[/2...b5/]] looks compromised as Black will lose one of the main benefit of the St Georges : the power at the queen side.

At that point, Black will usually play e6 and Nf6 in any order.

[[/4...Nf6/]] adds up pressure and forces 5. Qe2 (5. e5 would free the bishop line of fire).

[[/4...e6/]] builds Black pawn center and takes control of key squares.

== umm.... you probably should study Unix a bit more. ==

In &quot;A Neutral Look at Operating Systems&quot; in the OS X section, you mentioned that CD's would be mounted in  ./Volumes/etc...etc....  The problem with your statement is that they are not in &quot;./Volumes&quot; - they are in &quot;/Volumes&quot;. In Unix, the period ( . ) represents the current directory. So if the user were in their home directory and tried to go to ./Volumes, unless their name were Volumes, they would get an error. [[User:Peteturtle|Brandon Johnsonn]] 18:00, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Helium balloon

One method of getting an aerial shot is tying your camera to a bunch of helium baloons, which then floats above the scene that is to be filmed. The disadvantages of this include that the camera often will face the wrong way, and that too many baloons may cause the camera to drift away with the wind. &lt;- LMAO thats the funniest dame thing ive ever seen</text>

I've added the template from the (unfinished) iMovie page in iLife '05.

== not a stub ==

This isn't going to be a stub, I just don't have time to fill out the content till friday. I'd like the template to remain so that I don't have to add it again.  I've added a minimal amount of content to show that this isn't a stub..

== work done ==

Today I completed a rough draft of the &quot;Getting Started&quot; chapters. I'm going on 3 hours of sleep, so it's going to need some touchup.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Handlers ==

Handlers in SuperCard are subroutines.

They begin with the &quot;on&quot; keyword, followed by the handler name. They end with the &quot;end&quot; keyword, also followed by the handler name.

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
on calculateInterest
   -- other lines of code would be here
end calculateInterest
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Arguments ===

Handlers can take one or more arguments or parameters passed to them. These arguments should be included in the handler definition following the handler name and should be separated by commas.

==== Single Argument ====

Here's an example where a handler called &quot;calculateInterest&quot; takes a single argument &quot;baseAmt&quot; and multiplies it by an already defined global variable &quot;gInterestRate&quot; and stores it in an already defined global variable &quot;gInterestAmt&quot;.

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
on calculateInterest baseAmt
   global gInterestRate
   global gInterestAmt

   put (baseAmt * gInterestRate) into gInterestAmt
end calculateInterest
&lt;/pre&gt;

To call this handler in your code, you would do something like this:

Using a fixed, literal number:
&lt;pre&gt;
calculateInterest 5599
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or, like this, using a variable:
&lt;pre&gt;
calculateInterest preInterestAmt
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Multiple Arguments ====

Here's an example where a handler called &quot;calculateInterest&quot; that takes two arguments, &quot;baseAmt&quot; &amp; &quot;interestRate&quot;, multiplies them and then stores the result in an already defined global variable &quot;gInterestAmt&quot;.

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
on calculateInterest baseAmt, interestRate
   global gInterestAmt

   put (baseAmt * interestRate) into gInterestAmt
end calculateInterest
&lt;/pre&gt;

To call this handler in your code, you would do something like this:

Using fixed, literal numbers:
&lt;pre&gt;
calculateInterest 5599,0.07
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or, like this, using variables:
&lt;pre&gt;
calculateInterest preInterestAmt,anInterestRate
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Functions ==

Functions are also sburoutines like handlers, however functions should return a value using the &quot;return&quot; keyword just before the &quot;end [function_name]&quot; line that terminates the function. SuperTalk doesn't enforce this. It will let you declare functions that do not return values, just as it will let you return values in handlers. However, it is good form to not return values from handlers and to use a function rather than a handler when you need to return a value. Following this convention will help you write code that is easier to follow, debug, and maintain.

Calling functions is slightly different than calling handlers. Calling a function generally requires that the function name be  followed by a set of opening and closing parentheses, even if no arguments are being passed.

Here's an example of a function that takes no arguments:
&lt;pre&gt;
function piTimesTwo
   put pi * 2 into theResult

   return theResult
end piTimesTwo
&lt;/pre&gt;

To call this function you would do something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
put piTimesTwo() into doublePi
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or, you could use it without storing it's results like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
if someOtherVariable &gt; piTimesTwo() then
   -- lines of code for a true result would go here
else
   -- actions for the false result would go here
end if
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that even though the &quot;piTimesTwo&quot; function takes no arguments, when it is called, it's name is followed by a set of empty parentheses.

=== Arguments ===

Just like a handler, a function can take one or more arguments.

==== Single Argument ====

Building on the example above, here's a function to calculate interest that takes only one argument, multiplies it by an already defined global variable, but instead of storing the result in another global variable, it returns it:

&lt;pre&gt;
function calculateInterest baseAmt
   global gInterestRate

   put (baseAmt * gInterestRate) into theResult

   return theResult
end calculateInterest
&lt;/pre&gt;

You could call this function with a literal number like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
set tInterestAmt to calculateInterest(5995)
&lt;/pre&gt;

But, more realistically, you would probably pass it an amount stored in a variable:
&lt;pre&gt;
set tInterestAmt to calculateInterest(somePreInterestAmt)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Multiple Arguments ====

And, finally, here's a more realistic (although probably overly simplistic) example of a function that takes two arguments, multiplies them, and then returns the result. The advantage being, that you don't need a globally defined variable for the interest rate. The reason this is overly simplistic is that you would not need to define a function just to multiply two numbers and store the result, however, I'm sure you can envision creating functions that do much more than just multiply two numbers before they return a result.

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
function calculateInterest baseAmt,interestRate
   put baseAmt * interestRate into theResult

   return theResult
end calculateInterest
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: It is not actually necessary to place (baseAmt * interestRate) into a new variable called &quot;theResult&quot;. The preceding function could have looked like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
function calculateInterest baseAmt,interestRate
   return (baseAmt * interestRate)
end calculateInterest
&lt;/pre&gt;

To call the function using two values already stored in variables, you would do something like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
put calculateInterest(someAmt,someInterestRate) into someInterestAmt
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Summary ==

Both handlers and functions allow you to define subroutines within your SuperTalk scripts.

Both handlers and functions can take:
*no arguments
*one argument
*multiple arguments

Handlers begin with the &quot;on&quot; keyword followed by the handler name.

Functions begin with the &quot;function&quot; keyword followed by the function name.

Both handlers and functions are terminated with the &quot;end&quot; keyword followed by the handler/function name.

When calling a handler that takes one or more arguments, the argument(s) are placed after the handler name without any enclosing parentheses.

When calling a function with no arguments, it is best to follow the function name with an empty set of parentheses. And when calling a function with one or more arguments, the argument(s) must be enclosed in parentheses.

You should use functions to create subroutines that return a value using the &quot;return&quot; keyword followed by a variable name or a calculation.

You should use handlers to create subroutines that do no return a value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think another set of major events that could be tracked would be relationships, such as Harry - Cho, Harry - Ginny, Ron - Hermione.  Thoughts?
:If you proposed a way of doing this, I would be interested. As long as it's planned well, I think that would fit in nicely. We can create a section of the page for them and list each with a subpage for each relationship. One thing I will absolutely remove is fan-like poppy relationship ideas and other things that are not fully apparent in the books. No Harry-Hermione, Hermione-Draco, Harry-Draco, etc. Proper analysis only, and only if that relationship is truly useful to the Guide. We need to execute such a thing with high standards. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 16:33, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
::Intriguing idea... though I am going to suggest that perhaps fan-inspired relationships might be mentioned and dismissed, with perhaps documentation on lack of evidence. But it would be difficult, because Ginny's relationships start with Harry, and go on to a couple of others, before they return to Harry. And presumably we'd want to mention Cho / Cedric and Lavender / &quot;WonWon&quot; as well... Hmm. Needs thought. Would the appropriate way to do this be to track the relationships only from the point of view of the principals, e.g. Ron, Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Cho, through the seven books? [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] 21:49, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
:::I think there are way too many relationships in all the book to cover them all. Only those of importance should be addressed. Mentioning some of the &quot;made up&quot; relationships might not be a bad idea as well since it is helpful to explain why they did not occur, but I personally wouldn't like much more coverage than that. Sticking to the primary characters is probably the best idea. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:51, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

== Possible Additions ==

An important event that definitely should have a page is &quot;Voldemort's First Downfall/Harry's Parents' Deaths&quot;.  Some other ones that can be considered are the &quot;Godric's Hollow Fiasco&quot; and the &quot;Visit to the Lovegood House&quot;.  Thoughts?

{{Closed|1= Conclusion is &lt;span style=&quot;background:green; color:white&quot;&gt; Closed&lt;/span&gt; as '''Delete'''.  These pages will be deleted soon. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 17:59, 17 December 2006 (UTC)}}

A game guide, not a textbook. I've kept a copy at [[StrategyWiki:Neopets]]. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:49, 25 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Speedy Delete''' - Also remember to protect the page and use our standard &quot;transwikied according to policy&quot; looks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:53, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

*'''Now that it's been transferred to the other wiki, Delete the copy here''' - Video games, being the transient, and unproductive, things they are, rarely have a place in a library outside of books on video game programming or video game history. Much like it would be impractical for wikibooks to try to maintain an instruction manual book for every DVD or MP3 player, it's impractical to think that we can or should document the workings of the gameplay of every game out there. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 19:02, 18 November 2006 (UTC)

:: It is not the job of _us_ to maintain a wikibook or wikiproject. It is the job of the authors. If a specific group wants to create a wikibook on a subject that they like, then why not? It is great practice for people to create a game guide, as well as giving Wikibooks some publicity. For example, I personally would not have come to wikibooks as an active contributor if it weren't for my Maple Story book. I also disagree with your statement and reasoning. We do by policy allow software manuals on this site. We have guides for Linux, Windows, and tons of programming languages. We have manuals for specific software like Matlab, CSound, and even Gmail around here.

:: Additionally, what do we waste? Resources? These files are stored as pure text files and take up very little server [http://download.wikimedia.org/enwikibooks/20061102/ space]. I do realize that it is compressed, but you can download the entire Wikibooks database, images and complete histories included at 298.2 MB. Guideline does say 20x the size uncompressed, but even by today's standards, several Gigs is not much space indeed. Remember, thats the _entire_ Wikibooks project I'm talking about here. Even if the pages were deleted, they'd remain on the server anyway. So we wouldn't gain any resources either.

:: Leaving video game guides on this site offers little cost with lots of reward. I don't really see the issue with moving them. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 16:29, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

:::My concern is not so much that video games aren't academic subjects, or that they are specific to a given audience of those that use them, or that they are solely electronic in nature, or even that the audience or authorship of any given one of these books may be large or small. My concern is the amount of work it will create for others if dozen after dozen video game guides are created under a relativistic &quot;everything's good&quot; policy, only to have the videogames stop being developed at some point and to have us left with a bunch of meaningless content here. Not everyone finishes what they start and I'm concerned that we'll have dozens of people people who would otherwise spend their time more productively waste time checking on and cleaning up video game pages.

:::Video games are not just trivial. They're often transient. Open Source software with a wide base of developers, or a huge institutional software or web company, whose products have been known to stick around, provide justifiable material for time expenditure. On the same vein I wouldn't be adverse to a guide for the heavily popular video games out there. World of Warcraft or such. Those things are likely to be important in a few years just as they are important today. And if Neopets is shown to be a notable, widely used videogame that is likely to be maintained for the next few years, well, perhaps it's okay to have it here, because it's of some educational relevance. But just like I wouldn't advise the creation of a wikibook about some new software created by some nowhere startup new jersey IT company, I don't think we should clog this site up a hundred other books that will be more or less useless to people.

:::The &quot;we have the space&quot; argument doesn't phase me. The reason we have votes for deletion is because some books need to be deleted. Not necessarily because they contain innapropriate content or violate copyright, but because they contain no content or their content is useless. Books with no text, and books with useless text, should be deleted. They're a waste of time and space, and make wikibooks harder to organize. The problem with video game guides is that, for most of them, in a few years they'll be useless. They don't hold their use for long. Thus, it would be prudent to make sure that video game guides are created, or kept, in another wiki which has a more liberal policy as to what kinds of content it will uphold. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 01:56, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

::::I agree with monk on these points, and I would also like to add that we aren't deleting these guides entirely, but instead they have been moving--of their own accord--to strategy wiki. Once the book is moved to the new location, it is ''beneficial for the book'' not to fork the contributing community. In other words, the book will benefit the most if it is in one location (not copied here and there), and if there is one dedicated group of people working on a single version of it. I dont think anybody here wants to blindly cut out all videogame guides, but at the same time, if this isn't the best home for them, they should be moved someplace better, where they will get the attention they deserve. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:39, 4 December 2006 (UTC) 

:::: When the book becomes useless, then delete it. Until then, there is no argument against a specific book. There are useless video game guides. There are also plenty of other useless Wikibooks around here. Nonetheless, I do think I should concede on this point; as this Neopets book is somewhat incomplete and can be easily considered a stub. However; if someone was willing to spend the time and effort to create a video game guide on Wikibooks; I don't think we should stop them. Basically, I feel that deleting a book because it is a Video Game is a dangerous path. Delete it because it is useless, delete it because it is a stub. But if there is a well written, well maintained, and overall well done Wikibook on a subject that deals with a specific Video Game, we should keep this rare gem on Wikibooks. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:55, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

I think it is safe to say that all videogame guides that have been migrated to another site are going to be deleted. no sense listing them here on VfD if they dont need to be here. Just mark all of them in the future as speedy deletes, and we will take care of them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:48, 26 October 2006 (UTC)
: I disagree, kinda. Mark them as transwiki so that we don't scare off potential users. I still remember that case where books were being deleted too fast. Deletion is a strong word, especially to newbies, so I think it would do us well to refrain from using it. In this case, transwiki would not only describe the situation better, but keep some PR a little better. If you know what I mean. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)
::A little semantic change can make a difference, I agree. However, this page is for the discussion of pages that are going to be deleted, and the pages of the videogame guides ''are going to be deleted from this project''. Now, we can call the process &quot;transwikiing&quot;, and we can post a link to the &quot;new home of the book&quot;, but fact is it still gets deleted. Perhaps we need a new temple to mark books that are being transwikied in this way?--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:16, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
::: Perhaps a &quot;This page has moved to ...&quot; message? Or &quot;This page is moving to xxx project&quot; ? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:00, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Hold''' I'm surprised this hasn't been deleted yet, but I'm glad that I get to post a comment. Are we sure that deleting the wikibook is what the contributing community wants? Or are we just assuming we are being nice by deleting it? Do any in the interested (note ''interested'' not ''contributing'') community know that this or the other exists? Do any in the contributing community know that the other exists? I think those are serious questions that need to be answered before we consider deleting this book with the intent to do good for the apparent community. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 18:02, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
** '''Oppose''' deletion. Circumstances surrounding are too unclear for me to vote delete. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:58, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I've played Neopets before, but I'm no real expert. This book seems to have only one real complete section in it, which is [[Neopets/Stock market]]. The guide has been stalled for several months, and on that grounds, I guess you could consider this to be a stub. The Stock Market may be one important part of Neopets, but there is a lot more to Neopets than just the stock market. Enough for me to say that this book is a stub. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 02:00, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
'''Delete''' - I used to play neopets a fair bit (though it's been a few years).  The main &quot;gameplay&quot; was in the minigames, which this guide has very little information about.  The main way to make money was Restocking (buy items from official &quot;shops&quot; resell them in personal stores) which has no info at all.  The stock market section isn't that &quot;big&quot; in the game, and the guide here seems more like a general stock market thing than neopets specific (neopets might even make a nice addition to a real stock market book). -- [[User:Prod|Prod-You]] 06:11, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' reviewing this one in the hope of closing before its &quot;long service award&quot; the balance of votes seems to me to be delete.  It appears to be a very patchy stub with no current interest.  Unless there is a real indication of value or interest very soon I will close as delete --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:53, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Phytopathology''' is the study of how disease processes develop in plants. These processes are of particular concern in the fields of agriculture and horticulture. There are several major groups of organisms that cause disease on plant, each of these are outlined below.

== Fungal Phytopathogens ==

There are over 10,000 fungal pathogens of plants. The fungal plant pathogens themeselves fall into to major groups, the biotrophs which feed from living plant tissue and the necrotrophs which kill plant cells and then live off the nutrients released. However, many plant pathogens adopt a hybrid lifestyle, initially acting as biotrophs before converting to a nectrophic lifestyle. These are called hemibiotrophs.

The majority of phytopathogenic fungi belong to the Ascomycetes and the Basidiomycetes. 

The fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually via the production of spores. These spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soil bourne. Many soil bourne spores, normally zoospores and capable of living saprophytically, caring out the first part of their lifecycle in the soil.

Fungal dieases can be controlled through the use of fungicides in agriculture, however new races of fungi often evolve that are resistant to various [[../Fungicides|fungicides]].

== The Oomycete Phytopathogens ==

The oomycetes are fungal like organisms that until recently used to be mistaken for fungi. They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens including the genus ''[[../Phytopthora/]]'' which includes the casual agents of [[../Phytophthora infestans|potato blight]] and [[../Phytophthora ramorum|sudden oak death]], and members of the genus ''[[../Pythium/]]'', which causes damping off of seedlings.

Despite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomyctes have developed very similar infection strategies and so many plant pathologists group them with fungal pathogens. The oomycetes are particularly difficult to control, and many can live in the soil as saprotrophs for long periods.

== Protozoa ==

There are a few examples of plant diseases caused by protozoa. They are transmitted as zoospores which are very durable, and may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. They have also been shown to transmit plant viruses.

When the motile zoospores come into contact with a root hair they produce a plasmodium and invade the roots.

== Bacterial Phytopathogens==

Most bacteria that are associated with plants are actually saprophytic, and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 species, are able to cause disease. Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in sub-tropical and tropical regions of the world.

Most plant pathogenic bacteria are rod shaped (bacilli). In order to be able to colonise the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors. There are 4 main bacterial pathogenicity factors:

1. Cell Wall Degrading Enzymes - used to break down the plant cell wall in order to release the nutrients inside. Used by pathogens such as Erwinia to cause soft rot.

2. Toxins. These can be non-host specific, and damage all plants, or host specific and only cause damage on a host plant.

3. Phytohormones - for example Agrobacterium changes the level of Auxin to cause tumours.

4. Exopolysaccharides - these are produced by bacteria and block xylem vessels, often leading to the death of the plant.

Bacteria control the production of pathogenicity factors via Quorum sensing.

''[[../Phytoplasma/]]'' and ''Spiroplasma'' are a genras of bacteria that lack cell walls, and are related to the mycoplasmas which are human pathogens. Together they are referred to as the mollicutes. They also tend to have smaller genomes than true bacteria. They are normally transmitted by sap-sucking insects, being transferred into the plants phloem where it reproduces.

== Plant Viruses ==

There are many types of plant virus, and some are even asymptomatic. Most plant viruses have small, single stranded RNA genomes. These genomes may only encode 3 or 4 proteins: a replicase, a coat protein, a movement protein to allow cell to cell movement and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector. 

Plant viruses must be transmitted from plant to plant by a vector. This is normally an insect, but some fungi, nematodes and protozoa have been shown to be viral vectors.

== Plant Parasitic Nematodes ==

[[../Nematodes/]] are small, multicelluar worm like creatures. Many leave freely in the soil, but there are some species which paratisise plant roots. They are mostly a problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, where they may infect crops. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, whereas cyst nematodes tend to only be able to infect a few species. Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.

== Examples of Plant Pathogens ==

Significant fungal plant pathogens
*Ascomycetes
**''[[../Fusarium/]]'' spp.
**''[[../Thielaviopsis/]]'' spp. (Causal agents of: canker rot, black root rot, ''Thielaviopsis'' root rot)
**''[[../Verticillium/]]'' spp.
**''[[../Magnaporthe grisea/]]'' (T.T. Hebert) M.E. Barr; causes blast of rice and gray leaf spot in turfgrasses
*Basidiomycetes
**''[[../Rhizoctonia/]]'' spp.
**''[[../Puccinia/]]'' spp.; causal agents of severe rusts of virtually all cereal grains and cultivated grasses

Significant oomycete plant pathogens
*''[[../Pythium/]]'' spp.
*''[[../Phytophthora/]]'' spp.; including the causal agent of the Irish Potato Famine

Significant bacterial plant pathogens
*Proteobacteria
**''[[../Xanthomonas/]]'' spp.
**''[[../Pseudomonas/]]'' spp.

Significant abiotic disorders can be caused by:
:'''''Natural'''''
::Drought
::Frost damage, and breakage by snow and hail
::Flooding and poor drainage
::Nutrient deficiency
::Salt deposition and other soluble mineral excesses (e.g. gypsum)
::Wind (windburn, and breakage by hurricanes and tornados)
::Lightning and wildfire (also often man-made)
:'''''Man-made''''' (arguably not abiotic, but usually regarded as such)
::Soil compaction
::Pollution of air and/or soil
::Salt from winter road salt application
::Herbicide over-application
::Poor education and training of people working with plants (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees)
::Vandalism

A '''hot dog''' (also known as a '''frankfurter''') is a variant on a sandwich, or the [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] inside, usually made of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]].  In consists of a [[Cookbook:Bun|bun]] and a frankfurter sausage, and usually has a variety of toppings, including [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]], [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]], [[Cookbook:Relish|relish]], [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s, and [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickle]]s. [[Cookbook:Cheese|Cheese]] is also a popular topping for Hot Dogs. Hot Dogs range in size, and can be up to a foot long.

When wrapped in bacon and deep-fried, it is known as a Danger dog when served with [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise |mayonnaise ]] and as a [[Cookbook:Jersey_breakfast_dog|Jersey breakfast dog]] when served on a fried egg and cheese. [http://www.esquire.com/print-this/60things0507]

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

In general terms, an interface is the set of public members of a component. Of course, this is also true for C# [[C Sharp Programming/Interfaces|interface]]. A C# class also defines an interface, as it has a set of public members. A non-abstract C# class defines the implementation of each member.

In C#, it is possible to have a type that is intermediate between a pure interface that does not define any implementation, and a type that defines a complete implementation. This is called an ''abstract'' class and is defined by including the {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} keyword in the class definition.

An abstract class is somewhere between a C# interface and a non-abstract class. Of the public members defined by an abstract class, any number of those members may include an implementation.

For example, an abstract class might provide an implementation for ''none'' of its members.

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} {{C sharp/kw|class}} AbstractShape
 {
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Draw(Graphics g);
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} X {{{C sharp/kw|get}}; {{C sharp/kw|set}};}
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} Y {{{C sharp/kw|get}}; {{C sharp/kw|set}};}
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

This class is equivalent to an interface in many respects. (One difference is
that a class that derives from this class cannot derive from any other class.)

An abstract class may also define ''all'' of its members.

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} {{C sharp/kw|class}} AbstractShape
 {
    {{C sharp/kw|private}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} _x;
    {{C sharp/kw|private}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} _y;
    //
    // ... (other members)
    //
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Draw(Graphics g) {g.DrawRectangle(Pens.Black, g_rect);}
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} X {{{C sharp/kw|get}}{{{C sharp/kw|return}} _x;}}
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} Y {{{C sharp/kw|get}}{{{C sharp/kw|return}} _y;}}
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

And an abstract class may define some of its members, but leave others undefined.

&lt;code&gt;
 {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} {{C sharp/kw|class}} AbstractShape
 {
    {{C sharp/kw|private}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} _x;
    {{C sharp/kw|private}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} _y;
    //
    // ... (other members)
    //
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} {{C sharp/kw|void}} Draw(Graphics g);
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} X {{{C sharp/kw|get}}{{{C sharp/kw|return}} _x;}}
    {{C sharp/kw|public}} {{C sharp/kw|double}} Y {{{C sharp/kw|get}}{{{C sharp/kw|return}} _y;}}
 }
&lt;/code&gt;

Although an abstract class is similar to a non-abstract class, some important differences exist. For one thing, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class with the {{C sharp/kw|new}} keyword. For example, the following statement will raise a compiler error:

&lt;code&gt;
    AbstractShape shape = {{C sharp/kw|new}} AbstractShape();
&lt;/code&gt;

Of course, assuming the concrete class {{C sharp|Square}} derives from {{C sharp|AbstractShape}}, the following would be correct:

&lt;code&gt;
    AbstractShape shape = {{C sharp/kw|new}} Square();
&lt;/code&gt;

A second difference is that an abstract class may have abstract members. As was shown above, this is not a must. To create a class with at least one abstract member, the {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} keyword must be added before the {{C sharp/kw|class}} keyword.

The third difference is that a class cannot be both {{C sharp/kw|abstract}} and {{C sharp/kw|sealed}}.

== Implementing methods ==

As with virtual methods, you can implement abstract methods or properties with the {{C sharp/kw|override}} keyword:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class Rectangle : AbstractShape
{
    private double _x;
    private double _y;
    // ...
    public override void Draw(Graphics g)
    {
        g.DrawRectangle(Pens.Black, g_rect);
    }

    public override double X {
        get { return _x; }
        set { _x = value; }
    }

    public override double Y {
        get { return _y; }
        set { _y = value; }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Overriding an abstract method is effectively the same as overriding a virtual method - you cannot change the access specifiers (i.e. you can't convert a protected abstract method into public), and you cannot add a missing get or set to an abstract property. The only difference is that &quot;forgetting&quot; the {{C sharp/kw|new}} or {{C sharp/kw|override}} keyword results in an error, if the class this method is belonging to was derived from an abstract class, and it will result in a warning, if the class tries to override a virtual method.

Wikibookians may not always agree with each others decisions and sometimes decisions which effect the Wikibooks community come up which need to be discussed beforehand. This proposal tries to address these concerns and provide guidelines on how to resolve them.

== Decision making ==
''The best way to resolve a dispute is to avoid one in the first place.''

[[WB:WIW|Textbooks]] are created by making [[WB:BOLD|bold]] changes and through cooperation between users. People naturally feel protective about the work that they create. When someone makes changes you consider biased or inaccurate, do not simply revert the changes, improve it instead. The revision you would prefer will not be established by reverting. Wikibookians are strongly encouraged to follow several basic principles:

# Following the [[WB:NPOV|NPOV]] policy can help you write &quot;defensively&quot;, and limit your own bias in your writing.
# Provide a good edit summary when making significant changes that other users might object to.
# [[WB:FAITH|Assume good faith]] and treat changes as reasonable and positive.
# [[WB:CIVIL|Be civil]] and [[WB:ATTACK|respectful]] of the opinions and decisions made by other Wikibookians.
# Discuss changes you disagree with on the talk page. If you encounter rude or inappropriate behavior, resist the temptation to [[WB:ATTACK|respond unkindly]], and remain [[WB:CIVIL|civil]].

When disputes cannot be avoided. The most important tools Wikibookians have for resolving disputes are '''compromise''' and '''consensus'''. By following a general ''decision making process'' disputes can be resolved more easily.

=== High impact decisions ===

'''High impact decisions''' involve the adoption, adaptation or rejection of policies and guidelines and other decisions that have a long term effect on the culture and structure of Wikibooks. These decisions must always be made through the process of building a community consensus. Such decisions include:

#Making a Wikibookian an [[WB:RFA|administrator]] or a [[WB:RFA|bureaucrat]]
#Giving a Wikibookian [[WB:RFA|checkuser rights]] or [[WB:RFA|bot rights]]
#Modifying official Wikibooks [[WB:PAG|policies and guidelines]]
#Changing the status of policies and guidelines (such as from proposed to official)
#Establishing the voting rules for low impact decisions
#Determining whether a page containing substantive content that is not unambiguously outside our inclusion criteria should be [[WB:VFD|deleted]]

=== Low impact decisions ===

'''Low impact decisions''' involve proposals that express the community's preferences and feelings about issues that fall well below the level of policies and guidelines, and do not affect the long term culture or structure of Wikibooks. For these sorts of decisions, Wikibookians are welcome to employ multiple means for decision-making, including consensus, majority votes or 3rd party arbitration. Consensus is the manner in which a dispute should be settled if no another method is agreed upon by all Wikibookians involved. The manner in which a dispute is settled may change if the majority of involved Wikibookians agree to the changed.

Examples of low impact decisions are:

#Determining what books should be listed as [[Wikibooks:Featured books|featured books]].
#Determining the content, structure or scope of a single textbook or project.
#Creating a new policy or guideline proposal.

=== Process ===

Anyone may start a good faith discussion to discuss any issues and voice their opinion. Decision making relies upon Wikibookians engaging in negotiation and compromise through [[WB:CIVIL|civil]] discussions that ultimately leads to a vast majority of involved Wikibookians agreeing on some decision. There is only one allowable voice per person, not one voice per username. Wikibookians with multiple accounts should not post opinions from more then one account. Remember: comments are judged on their quality, not on their quantity. Comments that are suspected of being cast in bad faith may be discarded.

There is no single &quot;right way&quot; to achieve consensus, however discussions should last long enough that all Wikibookians who may be interested are given an opportunity to join in and voice their opinion. One possible step-by-step process for discussions and working towards consensus is:

# A clearly publicized proposal is made and discussion about the proposal is invited by all interested Wikibookians.
# The proposal is discussed and initial concerns may be raised. 
# If initial concerns are raised, these are discussed. The proposal may be modified during these discussions.
# A call for consensus regarding the proposal is made in the form of a discussion and subsequent measurement of the degree of consensus with a [[w:Straw poll|straw poll]].
# If there are no objections within a reasonable timeframe, the proposal is accepted and affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; has been reached on the proposal.
# If there are still objections, the objections should be discussed and:
## The proposal may be dropped. Affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; for the proposal was not reached. 
## The proposal may be modified to address these objections and resubmitted for discussion.
## A call for determining any consensus regarding the proposal may be made, disregarding objections. A call for this second measurement of the degree of consensus should not be made lightly if there are still objections and should only occur after substantive good faith discussion of both the proposal and objections has taken place. The community can:
### Accept the proposal in spite of objections, and affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; has been reached.
### Not accept the proposal as &quot;community consensus&quot; has not been reached and repeat the process if necessary.

Discussions once started must not be forked, but may be moved if the vast majority of Wikibookians agree to it or the dispute has been resolved. Discussions which have been moved should be clearly indicated so that anyone wishing to add to a discussion can find it. Each comment in a discussion should be signed (using four tildes: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), to identify the Wikibookian. Anonymous comments will not be given any weight or consideration, and may be removed altogether. Important discussions should be publicized in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] and on the [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]], or other high-traffic areas. For high-impact decisions, discussions and debates should be left open as long as progress towards reaching consensus is being made.

=== User responses ===

Wikibookians who strongly disagree with the community consensus may consider the following options:

# Propose alternatives or alterations to existing decisions.
# Concede to the community's decision.
# Take a wikibreak to cool off.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">s is a complex number, wouldn't it be more correct to write Re{s} ?

:Where specifically are you talking about?

when looking at ROC you need to write Re(s) because you can't put a complex number in inequality. (ex: you can't write 3+4i&gt;0)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Engineering Analysis}}

Many of the concepts that we have learned so far have been dealing with random variables. However, these concepts can all be translated to deal with vectors of random numbers. A random vector X contains N elements, X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, each of which is a distinct random variable. The individual elements in a random vector may or may not be correlated or dependent on one another. 

:&lt;math&gt;X = \begin{bmatrix}X_1\\X_2\\\vdots\\X_N\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Expectation ==

The expectation of a random vector is a vector of the expectation values of each element of the vector. For instance:

:&lt;math&gt;E[X] = \begin{bmatrix}E[X_1]\\E[X_2]\\\vdots\\E[X_N]\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this definition, the mean vector of random vector X, denoted &amp;mu;&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; is the vector composed of the means of all the individual elements of X:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_X = \begin{bmatrix}\mu_{X_1}\\\mu_{X_2}\\\vdots\\\mu_{X_N}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Correlation Matrix ==

The correlation matrix of a random vector X is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;R_X = E[XX^T]&lt;/math&gt;

Where each element of the correlation matrix corresponds to the correlation between the row element of X, and the column element of X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. The correlation matrix is a real-symmetric matrix. If the off-diagonal elements of the correlation matrix are all zero, the random vector is said to be uncorrelated. If the R matrix is an identity matrix, the random vector is said to be &quot;white&quot;. For instance, &quot;white noise&quot; is uncorrelated, and each element of the vector has an equal correlation value.

=== Matrix Diagonalization ===

As discussed earlier, we can diagonalize a matrix by constructing the V matrix from the eigenvectors of that matrix. If X is our non-diagonal matrix, we can create a diagonal matrix D by:

:&lt;math&gt;D = V^{-1}XV&lt;/math&gt;


If the X matrix is real symmetric (as is always the case with the correlation matrix), we can simplify this to be:

:&lt;math&gt;D = V^TXV&lt;/math&gt;

=== Whitening ===

A matrix can be whitened by constructing a matrix W that contains the inverse squareroots of the eigenvalues of X on the diagonal:

:&lt;math&gt;W = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda_1}} &amp; \cdots \\ 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda_2}} \cdots \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this W matrix, we can convert X into the identity matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;I = W^TV^TXVW&lt;/math&gt;

=== Simultaneous Diagonalization ===

If we have two matrices, X and Y, we can construct a matrix A that will satisfy the following relationships:

:&lt;math&gt;A^TXA = I&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A^TYA = D&lt;/math&gt;

Where I is an identity matrix, and D is a diagonal matrix. This process is known as simultaneous diagonalization. If we have the V and W matrices described above such that

:&lt;math&gt;I = W^TV^TXVW&lt;/math&gt;,

We can then construct the B matrix by applying this same transformation to the Y matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;W^TV^TYVW = B&lt;/math&gt;

We can combine the eigenvalues of B into a transformation matrix Z such that:

:&lt;math&gt;Z^TBZ = D&lt;/math&gt;

We can then define our A matrix as:

:&lt;math&gt;A = VWZ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A^T = Z^TW^TV^T&lt;/math&gt;

This A matrix will satisfy the simultaneous diagonalization procedure, outlined above.

== Covariance Matrix ==

The Covariance Matrix of two random vectors, X and Y, is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_X = E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)^T] = E[(Y-\mu_Y)(X-\mu_X)^T]&lt;/math&gt;

Where each element of the covariance matrix expresses the variance relationship between the row element of X, and the column element of Y. The covariance matrix is real symmetric.

We can relate the correlation matrix and the covariance matrix through the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;R = Q + \mu_X\mu_X^T&lt;/math&gt;

== Cumulative Distribution Function ==

An N-vector X has a cumulative distribution function F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; of N variables that is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;F_X(X) = P[X \le x] = P[X_1 \le x_1, X_2 \le x_2, \cdots, X_N \le x_N]&lt;/math&gt;

== Probability Density Function ==

The probability density function of a random vector can be defined in terms of the N&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; partial derivative of the cumulative distribution function:

:&lt;math&gt;f_X(X) = \frac{\partial^N F_X(X)}{\partial X_1 \partial X_2 \cdots \partial X_N}&lt;/math&gt;

If we know the density function, we can find the mean of the i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; element of X using N-1 integrations:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{X_i} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \cdots \int_{-\infty}^\infty x_if_X(x) dx_1 dx_2 \cdots dx_n&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
== Introduction ==
=== Preamble ===

[[w:SQL|SQL]] (Structured Query Language) is one of the oldest programming languages in existence, first versions of which date back to 1969. Unfortunately, despite SQL being standardized since 1986, a lot of different implementations exist. They deviate more or less from each other, making developing applications that would work with a range of different SQL servers particularly difficult.

This wikibook is a compact comparative reference for several SQL language dialects. It lists particular common tasks and problems resolved in terms of several popular SQL server implementations. When possible, it tries to emphasize an universal solution. When it's not possible, it tries to list best practices.

Two main goals for the book are '''compactness''' and '''completeness'''. Obvious information, e.g. that a particular function or query does the same thing on all implementations, will not be listed. However, when some implementation(s) have important (even minor) deviations that can be a major pitfalls for developers, such information definitely should be listed.

=== Who should use this book ===

Target audience is:

* Developers who know a single dialect of SQL and want to develop for other SQL implementation right away (it's a simple way to).
* Developers who port a ready project from one SQL implementation to another or a bunch of SQL implementations.
* Developers who want their applications to be portable on a set of SQL servers (it's particularly useful for developers of open source projects that want to ensure that their application can be used on a variety of platforms).
* System administrators who have to support a wide range of SQL servers and don't want to memorize all possible queries and nuances for every server.
* Project managers or lead developers that want to estimate what SQL server is best for their project, given a list of requirements.

=== Who shouldn't use this book ===

This book is not a general learning course, not a comprehensive manual - it's a quick and compact reference that assumes that the reader knows basic concepts of SQL and precisely what is needed. The book discusses fairly advanced topics and minor, but important differences in SQL implementations that beginners / learners generally don't have to worry about.

=== Technical notes ===

Always where it is possible, a book tries to reference a web-published documentation, so a reader can always check particular detail, so a page is usually full of external documentation links.

As the full names of implementations are pretty long and inconvenient to spell out thoroughly every time, we'll use common abbreviations (shown in '''bold''') to distinguish SQL dialects. Also, we only provide links to corresponding Wikipedia articles here, not on every occasion.

Many pages in this book include comparison tables that can be pretty long. It is recommended to install a comparison table extension to view these tables comfortably.

=== SQL implementations covered in this book ===

Several SQL dialects are covered in this book. Note that in all cases of particular implementations, only the latest stable version is described.

* '''[[w:SQL|Standard]]'''. There are several versions of SQL standard (SQL-86, SQL-89, SQL-92, SQL:1999, SQL:2003, [[w:SQL:2011|SQL:2011]]). The book would list all popular practices to do a job in all implementations, particularly emphasizing SQL versions that a particular solution works for (i.e. if some feature became standard since version X, it would be stated that such solution works since version X).
* '''[[w:IBM DB2|DB2]]''' (IBM DB2).
* '''[[w:Firebird (database server)|Firebird]]''' (Firebird 2.5). An open-source RDBMS forked from sources of [[w:InterBase|InterBase]] that were released by Borland on July 25, 2000. Firebird differs from Interbase and tries to be [http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=devel&amp;sub=engine&amp;id=SQL_conformance close] to SQL standard as much as possible 
* '''[[w:MonetDB|MonetDB]]''' An open-source column-store. (MonetDB. V11)
* '''[[w:MySQL|MySQL]]''' (MySQL 5.0)
* '''[[w:Microsoft SQL Server|MSSQL]]''' (Microsoft SQL Server 2008). A proprietary RDBMS produced by Microsoft, targeting enterprise market. Original codebase was derived from [[w:Adaptive Server Enterprise|Sybase SQL Server]], but was mostly rewritten. Documentation is available in MSDN in a well-structured form, quite easy to reference.
* '''[[w:Oracle database|Oracle]]''' (Oracle Database 11g2)
* '''[[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]]''' (PostgreSQL 8.4)
* '''[[w:SQLite|SQLite]]'''.
* '''[[w:Virtuoso Universal Server|Virtuoso]]''' (OpenLink Virtuoso running on Virtuoso Universal Server).
* '''[[w:Linter_SQL_RDBMS|Linter]]'''

The ISO publication ([http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=53686 ISO/IEC 9075-14]) is part of the [[w:SQL|SQL]] standard. Formerly it was named SQLX or [[w:SQLXML|SQL/XML]]. It defines the data type &lt;code&gt;XML&lt;/code&gt; and functions acting on this data type as well as functions creating and handling XML objects (elements, attributes, ...) within this data type. Oracle denotes the data type XMLType.

As a wikipedian take a look at the relevant pointer - the places are not the same!

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:37, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Thank you Herby, and by the way, I do know the basics of talk pages (such as the &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;). I am a student in school and plan on primarally using Wikibooks for reference (as I do with Wikipedia). Again, Thanks for the welcome. If I have anything to contribute with, I will. Bye!

:No problem but it was [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] that I was meaning, plenty the same - quite a bit different --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

My name is Kosta, and I live in Toronto (no big surprise there!). I am currently working on the following Wikibook:

* [[Student's Guide to Michel Foucault]]

==Interests==

''My personal interests include:''

* Literature (I'm currently into thrillers, but I keep coming back to works by Joyce and Atwood)
* English (I love etymology and theories of language acquisition)
* Education (especially technology-enhanced learning and critical pedagogy)
* History (mainly post-confederation Canadian history, but also general Western history)
* Philosophy (I've recently re-discovered my interest in Foucault, hence the Wikibook)

''My applied interests include:''
* Teaching English to college-level ESL learners
* Using Web 2.0 tools such as discussion boards, wikis, blogs, and podcasts, both in my own teaching and in my training of colleagues
* Developing resources (handouts, &quot;user guides,&quot; online demos, etc.)

I would like to start a motion to enforce this proposal as a {{tl|policy}} instead of the current guideline text at [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]. The current guideline is already followed with few (if any) exceptions, and this should be a case of policy conforming to the community. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:24, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:Have to say I'm not sure I agree with ''&quot;For high-impact decisions, discussions and debates should be left open as long as progress towards reaching consensus is being made.&quot;'' to me that is death by attrition - those not bored to death will win? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

::That's actually one part of the proposal that hasn't changed from the current enforced version! But yes, it is death by attrition, because the community must reach concensus before a change can be made. Basically, there are three ways a discussion can end:
::#Everybody agrees to accept (proposal accepted)
::#Everybody agrees to reject (proposal rejected)
::#People can't agree, nothing happens (implicit rejection).
::As such, it is much harder to change the status quo then it is to keep things the same. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

I see Whiteknight as making two distinct proposals:

:#That the decision making guideline should be reclassified as a policy
:#That Decision making/Unstable should replace the current verson of WB:Decision making

On the first point, I agree that we should have a decision making &lt;u&gt;policy&lt;/u&gt;. That policy may, in time, get supplemented by guidelines, but for now I think it is sufficient just to have a policy.

In terms of the unstable branch, I'm afraid that I'm not really sure what it is trying to achieve. I note from the history that it appears to be a joint effort of Darklama and Whiteknight. I'd be grateful if one or both of them could let me know what their objective is and how they see the unstable branch version as achieving that objective.

One aspect I do not like is the early introduction of a substantial section on &quot;Ownership and Authorship&quot;. Ownership and authorship has no bearing on decision making, so I don't see why a section on this is needed in this policy. If there is a point to be made there, it is either for another policy on a related topic or in an explanatory guideline to the policy proper. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:54, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

: The objective was to make it clearer that the reason for the decision making process is due to the nature of Wikibooks not having a single author or owner and that the decision making process is used for more then making policy decisions. I disagree with you. Ownership/Authorship does have bearing on decision making. If there was but one owner/author there would simply be no need to deal with disagreements since there would be nobody else to disagree with. The point is to make the decising making process more understandable and explain why it is needed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:10, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:Very astute, I am making two separate proposals (or, I am proposing that one thing happens in a particular way). Due to some recent events, it was brought to our attention that wikibooks doesnt have a policy equivalent to [[w:WP:OWN]], something that has already caused a few problems. I drafted a local version at [[WB:OWN]], but (out of fear of sprawl or instruction creep) [[User:Darklama]] proposed instead that we merge the text of the draft at [[WB:OWN]] into another policy. 
:History aside, I think that the section on ownership is an important one to have, and I also think that this is a mostly appropriate place for it. If decisions are made by concensus, then it's implicit that one user can't treat a particular discussion like a dictatorship. However, nowhere in all of wikibooks policy is it mentioned that this is the case (except implicitly from the definition of &quot;concensus&quot;). For that reason, I think that this policy needs to have at least some mention of ownership. However, you and I are of the same mind in that we both seem to prefer succinct policy documents with supporting guidelines. We could minimize the section here on ownership and redirect inquiries on the subject to [[WB:OWN]], but I'm afraid that (again, due to instruction creep), that people will fight the establishment of two separate documents much more then they would fight the establishment of a single monolithic policy. 
:Given the two options: (A) create a single monolithic policy document, or (B) create a succinct policy with supporting guidelines, I would prefer the latter, but not to the extent that I would try to prevent these policies from being implemented.--[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:11, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

First, may I thank Darklama and Whiteknight for their explanations? I'm afraid, however, that I find myself disagreeing with them: I don't see ownership and authorship as being related to our decision making process.

Let me illustrate by way of an example. Suppose, for sake of argument, that I protected all the book modules that I created so no-one else could edit them, so that I &quot;own&quot; those pages. (I agree this is contrary to policy, I just make this supposition to show that our decision making rules are a separate issue to ownership and authorship).

Under that supposition, there is only one sentence of the whole of the policy that follows that would be out of place (&quot;Decisions that affects the content, structure or scope of a single textbook or project, must follow the rules for high impact decisions except where all parties agree to use another basis.&quot;) The rest of the policy, eg how we decide admins, bureaucrats, BOTM, COTM, etc. is unchanged.

My conclusion is that we should not have something on ownership and authorship in this policy/guideline. I don't comment here on whether it may be appropriate to have it as a separate policy/guideline, or merged in with another policy/guideline. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 15:18, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

: The one sentence you speak of is a clarification of one that already exists in the current policy &quot;Should a decision need to be made that affects a single module, a single book or a single project it will usually use the rules for high impact decisions except where all parties agree to use another basis.&quot; So how we are suppose to decide book contents is unchanged as well, These changes are relatively minor and are ment to aid in clarifying whats already present in the policy and current practise. The current policy only mentions it as a possible after thought and seems to focus almost entirely on decision making as it applies to policy making. With these changes I think the policy becomes more balanced rather then focusing on one or the other and provides clarity as a result that decision making is about both working together to make decisions about books when disagreements arise and when working together on making policies that effect everyone. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:20, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

: ''ownership and authorship as being related to our decision making process''

: There is a need on Wikibooks to reduce debates and clear the path for active collaboration, there is a need to specify local or if you wish book policies (policies that go beyond general Wikibooks policies or guidelines), book communities etc...

: There are now several books that do provide not only a set of internal guidelines but also some external rules to how content contribution should proceed inside the books namespace, it is my view that such guidelines or rules are good and increase the consistency and enable a more structured and productive collaboration (a central location to express and establish the wishes of contributors for the evolution of the book) but this rises another problem...

: Who should have a say on the evolution of a particular book, Wikibookians in general are and should continue to be able to set general rules (or non book specific policies and guidelines), be able to participate in any book community (we must define that), etc... the normal rules doesn't need any change on that regard as we fallow a decision by consensus this would not involve  any change in the voting it would only reduce the scope of the debate to a specific interest group...

: Who should be defined as a book community, well anyone that actively participates in adding content to a book this should set aside spammer and people with no good intentions or even people that place form above content, form is ephemeral, content will always prevail by shifting the rules to define this new concepts a increased level of stability is archived for the development and general evolution of the books. 

: So I do agree with [[User:Darklama]] ''&quot;Ownership/Authorship does have bearing on decision making.&quot;'', as in the sense that authors is the one that sign and are responsible for their work (even legally) and are the first person interested in the work itself and its evolution, and we cannot forget that contributors do own their contributions, lets say for example a user has a book under a non GFDL compatible license and wants to port it/or part to Wikibooks, he may need to keep a consistent relation within the works structure...

: As for [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] example it doesn't work, any similar action (even if not prevented by a policy) could be objected to by any Wikibookian and an dispute and the need of consensus would arise that would restore the status quo, if not then it would have been sanctioned by the community and a future reversal would need the same consensus.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:50, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== Consensus ==

Until a consensus can agree that a good majority vote is necessary for decision taking there will always be problems.  The recent bust up over a programming text was small beer compared with what happens on Wikipedia. That said, any policy on the decision taking issue is better than none! [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 15:21, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

== Establishing policys ==

From my own experience, many of the policies and even the &quot;rules&quot; that govern things like the &quot;Wikijunior New Book of the Quarter&quot; section are usually done in such a way that somebody merely is '''bold''' and takes the initive to simply make something happen.

Certainly there is reason to say that policies that are established in this manner are merely &quot;proposed&quot; rather than &quot;enforced&quot;, which is precisely why for some time Wikibooks was mostly dominated by proposed policies rather than enforced ones.  Of course the distinction between proposed and enforced polcies was only done because a previously active admin decided to '''be bold''' and make the distinction, establishing a preceedent.

I will say that it has been very interesting to see how some of these policies have emerged.  My worry that I've expressed in the past is that I hate to see policies established for the sake of establishing policies.  Or more to the point, I also try to follow the policy (for my own behavior) of &quot;he who governs best governs least.&quot;

As another way to put it:  Rules are established to fix the mistakes of those who screwed it up for the rest of us.

There are times that policies and rules simply need to be established because of abusive behavior in the past.  Clearly some of the actions of vandals and the establishment of the various heirarchies of Wikimedia projects are a direct result of trying to deal with blatant vandalism and keep it down to a dull roar.  I have seen wikis where the vandals were successful in taking over and overthrowing the &quot;legitimate&quot; content developers (it is ugly BTW, especially when the website owner doesn't care in the least).  For the most part I think we have been successful in winning this particular battle, in spite of some bizzare things that happen from time to time.

On the other hand, there are some people who like to be rule lawyers and make rules and policies just for the sake of pure political power.  When done to an extreme, you end up with legalese text that is volumnous and discouraging to those who simply want to &quot;get the job done&quot;.  Often this is done explicitly to achieve some political objective or to promote some &quot;faction&quot; over another group.  This kind of policy making should be discourgaed when possible, and to be honest seems to be something of why I'm against (weakly) this whole decision making policy from becoming an enforced policy at all.

I don't think there are too many policies that really fit strongly into either extreme group, although I do believe there are some that are more strongly one or the other (the rules about granting check user rights are more to the rules made simply to write rules, for example).  In order to even get into the business of wrting policies, you have to have a bit of an ego on you anyway and being a bit of a politician and a lawyer to boot.

All this said, most of what is written here with this policy is mainly common sense written down, with the only &quot;policy&quot; really being the section on the community concensus process.  I would consider that a strong guideline, only to be circumvented when a genuine crisis situation develops.  

It should be noted that the process never really is completed.  It is reasonable for somebody to challenge a decision that was made in the past and question why it was done that way.  I have seen some policies get overturned in the past, even when set down by a prominent individual.

The worst situations I've dealt with while being an admin were those individuals who for some reason or another decided to appeal to &quot;higher authority&quot; and cause the wrath of members of the WMF board of trustees to be directly involved in settling a dispute.  While I like Jimbo personally, and I think his contributions have been very useful, he has been an incredibly disruptive force here on Wikibooks in the past.  Most of this is because his decisions have largly thrown out the whole concept of concensus, and even when you want to gain concensus his actions taint the whole process.  &quot;Jimbo says&quot; is usually sufficient to kill a discussion or change it to debate what exactly Jimbo said.  Luckily I don't think any admin except Jimbo has that sort of power.

BTW, as a side note, I do think Jimbo edits here on Wikibooks on addition account names and has even gone into the Staff Lounge under such names.  I strongly suspect a couple of them for personal reasons, but if he wants to be anonymous in doing so I will leave him in peace.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:50, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with a majority of what you have said, Rob. I do believe that we should keep our policy documents to a minimum, and I say this for a number of reasons: We want people to have a good amount of freedom, we want people to be able to excercise a certain amount of judgement and common sense when making decisions, and we don't want to fall into the over-legislative problems that wikipedia has experianced. However, I am not of the belief that we should have no policy documents, or that we should only have guidelines, or anything so extreme as that. I think that it should be the official policy of wikibooks that decisions are made by concensus, and not by any other method. We do need some rules here, and I think this is one of the few that we absolutely do need. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:59, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

== My edits (Proposal Text)==

I edited a bit. If you look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ADecision_making%2FUnstable&amp;diff=695439&amp;oldid=692753 the diff], you be'll horrified. It looks worse than it is. I don't know how to explain my edits; just take a look. Thank you very much. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 01:52, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

: I like your changes for the most part, I thought the definition of concensus should go before the impact of decisions section though in order for readers to know what concensus means before they get to that part. I merged most of it into the Terminology section. I tried to clearify what I believed you ment by &quot;deciding to enforce official Wikibooks&quot; by splitting it into its own example and changing it to say &quot;Changing the state of policies and guidelines (such as from proposed to official)&quot;. I changed the begining of the Process section to read:

: 'Wikibooks is not a demoncracy, Wikibookians discuss points, compromise and try to reach community consensus. Wikibookians generally do not &quot;vote&quot; on anything and a simple voter majority is not the default, nor recommonded method of deciding any discussion. Decision making relies upon Wikibookians acting in good faith to come to a commonly acceptable decision through negotiation and compromise.'
: 'There is no single &quot;right way&quot; to achieve community consensus. However, one possible step-by-step process for discussions and working towards a community consensus is:'

: And a few other [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ADecision_making%2FUnstable&amp;diff=695489&amp;oldid=695439 minor things]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:56, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I liked your changes, and you got my meaning right on. I made minor edits. I think that I didn't change the meaning of any of the clauses; it was all prosaic. Check 'em out [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3ADecision_making%2FUnstable&amp;diff=695654&amp;oldid=695489 here]. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 07:48, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

::: I liked some of your changes. I undid the introduction bit, because I think what it previously said was friendlier, but I kept &quot;than&quot; over &quot;then&quot; and I turned Textbook into a link to [[WB:WIW]]. I also cut down a little bit on the process through some I hope clarification. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:28, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
----
*How to run a discussion/User responses
There should a time restriction on re-evaluation of the same problem, and a limit to the number of votes to be equal or greater than the previous, something on those lines this will prevent needless debaites and policies to be passed or changed without the community noticing it.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:15, 29 December 2006 (UTC)
----
*´´&quot;Decisions that affects the content, structure or scope of a single textbook or project, must follow the rules for high impact decisions except where all parties agree to use another basis.&quot;''
This should be asked to [[User_talk:Darklama]] but I ask it here because it explains a change on the text.

[[User_talk:Darklama|Darklama]], why did you convert that to a low impact decision, what was rational of the change ? txs. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:16, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

:I believe the only way it is concidered a high impact decision is in the method it imploys which is using concensus as the method to resolve disputes when they arise if no other method is agreed to by the Wikibookians involved in the dispute. For example at one point you and I agreed to moderation which changed the method imployed to resolve an issue that arose. I believe calling it a high impact decision is misleading and is considerably inconsist with the rest of the text. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:24, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

::Not so, I proposed mediation to provide more view points (comments) but we were already working toward a consensus, well not a consensus but a compromise, since some of the dispute did arise form interpretation of our actual license and its use and that couldn't be compromised. Remember also that most of the moderators( they were also administrators ) avoided to make direct interpretations and none provided any acceptable solution . --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:41, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Greetings ==

Greetings, Elaragirl, Dark Queen of the Deletionist Cabal against Kittens, Stubs, Hope, and Inclusionists. I am familiar with your goings-on at Wikipedia, and have come to say &quot;Hi!&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Wikibooks!&quot; --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 22:44, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

== Hi Elaragirl! ==

Yes, I remember you... was pleased to see the new account on the RC feed :). Sorry if you're having a hard time on wp: the politics ''can'' get overwhelming there, for me it's just a matter of knowing when to ignore the politics (and to hit the ignore button before I'm fried with them).

That's a totally appropriate subject... actually there's a book on abnormal psych being written, I'll try to track it down. But if you have notes to start posting up, just go ahead and start... page and book merges are common on wikibooks. If you add the book title to [[Template:New]], it will be noticed, and if a merge is needed someone will get in touch. 

Let me or someone else know if you want wikipedia articles imported to include in the book... it's often nice not to have to start &quot;from scratch. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:17, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

:I couldn't help but read your message to [[User:SBJohnny]], and I wanted to donate my two cents to the conversation (for what little they are worth). If your book is on abnormal sexual psych, I would say that's sufficiently different from the current abnormal psych to avoid being merged. We are always looking for more knowledgible, intellegent, educated people to help write books here, and I can guarantee that the atmosphere is much more laid-back then it is at WP. Welcome to wikibooks (i love your talk page!) and if you have any other questions, there are plenty of people here to ask. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:09, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse than the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== User page new header! ==

I have to say I like that (&amp; long may it stay that way) - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 18:30, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

I like it too. I was a deletionist at Wikipedia, but I've quickly come to realise that I am not here, and that there is little need for deletionism. I like it that way. :) --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 21:05, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

::Long may the grin last.  I guess I arrived as a peeved deletionist but I'm getting better.  I still a bit prejudiced about crap pages tho.  In the end I guess WP just didn't suit me (twice! - the current one and a previous one so your name was familiar) WB does.  It is mildly frustrating at times but there's a good bunch here which helps a lot and its waay more laid back.  Would it bother you if I steal some of your user page style?  Mine was deliberately minimalist but it's bugging me a bit now (no idea when I'll get to it tho).  Looking forward to the book BTW. --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:00, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

:::Thanks - I like to learn from others.  Hope things get better for you, be happy to help if I can.  The book should be a good outlet --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:51, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

== Fixed... ==

I'm not sure why that was protected against editing... it was done by a sysop who was desysopped on wikipedia a few months ago, go figure :). 

It's unprotected now, feel free to list it. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:49, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

Nice CSS. :) --[[User:Remi0o|Remi0o]] 06:34, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

== wp mess ==

I saw the title of the page, and didn't read a single word. Wikipedia will be OK, it just needs to implode for a while... it's a tempest in a teapot, and regardless of the tempest, the tea's still yummy. Ignore it, there's nothing to see there :).

I'm on IRC, as usual (quite the party!). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:53, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

== Positive Psychology ==

Sure, I could use help. I don't really know much about it beyond reading a couple of magazine articles and ''The Art of Happiness'' by the Dalai Lama (if that counts). But anyway, I started it because it's a new, interesting field in psych and something people should know about. I guess I'll try watching the [http://my.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?course=fas-psy1504&amp;pageid=tk.page.psy1504.video Positive Psychology lectures] taught by Tal Ben-Shahar to educate myself.

You stated in your user page an interest in China. In that case, 看一看 at the progress on the [[Chinese (Mandarin)]] Wikibook. It has (IMO) a pioneering design and unparalleled quality for a language Wikibook, but is very short on content for the moment. I'm eager for more contributions or suggestions.

== Template:ASPCite ==

Hey Elara, is Template:ASPCite redundant to Template:DSMCite? And if so, may I (or you) nominate it for speedy deletion? Thanks, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 20:19, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== [[Sexual Health/Rape]] ==

Hello Elaragirl, how are things going with your book? It all looks very good to my untrained eye. 

This page is part of the [[Sexual Health]] book, a pet project of mine. I would like to write something about the topic of rape, to try and dispel the rumors, and talk about some of the issues involved. considering your work on the abnormal sexual psychology book, I was wondering if you had any notes/research/expertise in the area of rape that we could use to help expand this page? Even a short sidenote about the mindset of rapists, or the psychological effects on rape victims would  be valuable, if you have such information to share. 

If not, that's fine too, I can probably look up most of the information I need on google or wikipedia. Thanks in advance! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:43, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks very much for your input. I'm sincerely sorry if I have reminded you of any negative memories. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:50, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[Template:Abnormal Sexual Psychology]] ==

Hello Elaragirl, long time no see! I created this template for your book, and I've put it at the top of every page. &quot;Page header templates&quot; help to standardize the look-and-feel of the book, they give a standard way of navigating from page to page, and they serve as a vehicle for properly categorizing all the book's pages. I stole this template from your own work at [[Template:Abnormal Sexual Psychology/navtemplate]], to try and preserve your artistic vision for the book. You are free to change it, of course, if you want something different to suit your needs. Let me know if you have any questions. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:12, 17 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

== What's your name? ==
To ask someone else's name in Spanish, use ''Cómo'', then one of the phrases in the table below (''¿Cómo te llamas?'' is &quot;What's your name?&quot;).

In Spanish, to say your name, you use the reflexive verb ''llamarse'', which means literally ''to call oneself'' (''Me llamo Robert'' is &quot;My name is Robert&quot;).
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Verb|Llamarse|To call oneself|2}}

== The Spanish alphabet ==
Here is the normal Spanish alphabet. However words aren't alphabetized by it. Please read the notes and sections below. (Blue letters are a part of the normal English alphabet.)

!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CFEBBE&quot;|Notes about ''Ñ'' and ''RR''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
''N'' and ''Ñ'' are considered two different letters, as are ''RR'' and ''R'' (though no words begin with ''RR'').  They are alphabetized as separate letters, so ''Ñ'' always comes after ''N'', regardless of where it appears in the word.  Ex: ''muñeca'' comes after ''municipal'', and ''carro'' comes after ''carta''.
|-
!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|Notes about ''CH'' and ''LL''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F3F5DE&quot;|
''CH'' and ''LL'' used to be considered as distinct letters of the alphabet, but in 1994, the Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy) declared that ''CH'' and ''LL'' were not letters but [[w:Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. Accordingly, words beginning with ''CH'' and ''LL'' are now alphabetized under ''C'' and ''L'', respectively.
|-
!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;|Notes about ''K'' and ''W''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
''K'' and ''W'' are part of the alphabet but are mostly seen in foreign derived words and names, such as karate and whisky. For instance, kilo is commonly used in Mexico to refer to a kilogram.

Although the above will help you understand, proper pronunciation of Spanish consonants is a bit more complicated:

Most of the consonants are pronounced as they are in American English with these exceptions:
*'''b''' like the English ''b'' at the start of a word and after ''m'' or ''n''; otherwise closer to ''v'' (in Latin America there's no distinction)
*'''c''' before '''a''', '''o''', '''u''' and other consonants, like English ''k''
*'''c''' before '''i''' and '''e''' like English ''th'' in “think” (in Latin America is like English ''s'')
*'''ch''' like ''ch'' in “cheese”
*'''d''' between vowels (even if it starts a word following a word ending in a vowel) or at the end of a word, like English ''d'' in dental
*'''g''' before '''e''' or '''i''' like the Scottish pronunciation of ''ch'' in “loch”, except that it is voiced
*'''g''' before '''a''' or '''o''' like ''g'' in “get”
*'''h''' is always silent (except in the digraph ''ch'')
*'''j''' like the ''h'' in hotel
*'''ll''' is pronounced like English y in “yes”
*'''ñ''' like nio in “onion” (or gn in French cognac)
*'''q''' like the English ''k''
*'''r''' slighty trilled; like a soft ''d'' except at the beginning of a word or after '''l''', '''n''' or '''s''' where it is trilled
*'''rr''' should be trilled longer than a single ''r''
*'''v''' is pronounced like a cross between a ''v'' and a ''b''
*'''z''' like the English ''th'' (in Latin America, like English ''s'')

A '''rolling boil''' (also '''roiling boil''') is when a liquid is [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] rapidly with lots of bubbling. This requires much more energy than [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmering]], and is often discouraged because it can break up or alter the shape of ingredients, whereas simmering will keep the ingredients whole. 

Some recipes require a rolling boil for the entire cooking period. Typically, however, recipes will specify that the liquid is brought to a rolling boil, then reduced to a simmer for the remainder of the cooking period.</text>

This is a basic recipe detailing how to prepare basic '''roast chicken'''. The dish is popular worldwide.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], plucked with giblets removed
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], halved
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

== Procedure ==
#Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F)
#Rub salt in the cavity of the chicken, then insert the two halves of lemon.
#Rub the chicken skin all over with olive oil, then season generously with salt and pepper. Place in a lightly oiled roasting tin.
#Cook your chicken for 20 minutes per 450g (1lb) plus an additional 30 minutes at the end.
#Remove the chicken from the oven, cover loosely with foil and allow to rest for 20 minutes before carving.

==Notes==
* The chicken will be cooked when the juices run clear after it is removed from the oven. To check this, insert a knife tip into through the thickest part of the thigh and, using the flat of the knife, push against the flesh and look at the juice running out of the thigh.

==Techniques to keep the meat moist==
A common problem with roasting chicken is dry breast meat. There are numerous techniques to try and avoid this :-
* Always make sure that your chicken is well rested before carving. Resting allows the juices to go back into the flesh thereby moistening the meat.
* Baste the chicken in the fat that runs from it during cooking.
* Put the chicken in the oven breast side down for the first half an hour of cooking, so that the juice in the chicken runs into the breast. However, this will make it difficult to crisp the breast skin.
* Cover the breast with rashers of streaky [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] or [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]. The fat in the bacon will cook out into the breast meat underneath.
* You can part the skin from the breast meat prior to cooking. Carefully separate the two with your fingers taking care not to tear the skin. Into the gap between the skin you can insert softened [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] to keep the meat moist. This butter can be flavoured to impart flavour to the meat using chopped bacon, herbs and other seasonings.

The type of equipment you need depends entirely on what type of comic you wish to create. Below are some basic guidelines for the type of equipment one may use to create comics.

==Hand Drawn Comics==
For comics presented on a paper medium, you may need these tools for drawing:

#Pencil (different hardnesses are useful for guidelines)
#Paper
#Eraser
#[[w:Ruler|Ruler]]
#[[w:Marker|Marker]]

Also, as a side note, some artists ink their comics (Going over, or tracing them with ink) after drawing them in pencil. In which case you may need additional materials such as (these are optional):

#Correction Fluid 
#A tool for inking (could be a marker, fine-liner or quill)

If you are colouring by hand you could use:

#Coloured pencils
#Pens
#Paints
#Chalk

==Digital Comics==

If you would like to transform your paper-based comic into a web-based, online comic, you will need:

#Computer
#Scanner

For creating digital and web comics:

#[[w:Tablet PC|Tablet PC]]
#or [[w:Graphics Tablet|Graphics Tablet]]
#painting program on computer

You can also use a computer to colour a paper comic. For this you will need a graphics program. This can be as simple as Paint but better programs include:

#Photoshop
#Paint Shop Pro
#GIMP

&quot;Perfect for your next party, this guacamole is decorated to look like your favorite ballpark. A cream cheese baseball tops it off.&quot;

==Ingredients==
* 4 ounces [[cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], softened 
* 1 teaspoon packaged dry buttermilk salad dressing and seasoning mix 
* 3 large fresh, ripe [[cookbook:avocado|avocados]], halved, pitted, peeled 
* 3 tablespoons fresh [[cookbook:Lime|lime juice]] 
* 2 teaspoons coarse ground [[cookbook:Garlic Powder|garlic powder]] 
* 1 teaspoon [[cookbook:salt|salt]] 
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Red Chile Sauce|red pepper sauce]]
* 1/2 cup finely chopped [[cookbook:Red onion|red onion]] 
* 1/2 cup chopped, prepared roasted [[cookbook:Bell Pepper|red bell pepper]] 
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1/2 cup low fat [[cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]] 
* Thin wheat crackers 
* For dipping, bell pepper strips cut 1/2 inch wide, [[cookbook:Tortilla Chip|tortilla chips]] and/or crackers

==Procedure==
# In bowl, blend cream cheese and buttermilk seasoning. Place in plastic wrap, roll into a ball and chill in freezer for 1 hour or refrigerate overnight. 
# In bowl, coarsely mash avocado with lime juice, garlic, salt and red pepper sauce. 
# Stir in red onion and roasted bell pepper. 
# Using rubber spatula, scoop guacamole onto square plate. Spread out evenly, making a slight mound in center to create a 'pitchers mound'. 
# Spoon sour cream into pastry bag with fine tip or plastic bag with 1/8 inch corner cut out. Pipe thin 'base lines' onto guacamole 'field'. 
# To create the red 'stitching' for the baseball, cut the red bell pepper into 1 inch strips. Using a sharp knife, carefully remove fleshy inside of the pepper, reserving the red shiny skin. Slice the skin into very thin strips to create stitch lines for baseball. 
# To make baseball: Remove cream cheese from freezer or refrigerator. Roll to make a round baseball shape. Remove plastic wrap. Using a wooden pick, form the stitch lines on the ball. Use the very thin pieces of red bell pepper skin to lay over stitch lines. Place 'baseball' on the 'mound' in the center of the guacamole 'field'. 
# Use thin wheat crackers for 'bases'. 
# Serve crackers, tortilla chips and/or bell pepper strips as dippers.

&quot;This recipe uses raw eggs. See the module Egg for possible health risks.&quot;

Is this warning actually necessary? The ingredient list may call for raw eggs, but the health risks associate with eating raw eggs don't apply -- 15-20 minutes at 400 °F pushes the muffins (eggs and all) well above the requisite 160 °F. &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:64.235.108.17|64.235.108.17]] ([[User talk:64.235.108.17|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/64.235.108.17|contribs]]) 2006-12-21T13:04:00.&lt;/small&gt;

:Totally agree &amp;ndash; now removed. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:57, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

==Cinnamon==
is it 1/4 *cup* cinnamon? not 1/4 tbsp or tsp? &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Mythri achar|Mythri achar]] ([[User talk:Mythri achar|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mythri achar|contribs]]) 2007-04-11T06:20:15.&lt;/small&gt;

== Salt? ==

The ingredients list calls for 1 tsp salt, but it is not referenced anywhere in the instructions.  My guess would be that it belongs with the flour, butter, and sugar in Step 3, but I tried making these muffins without salt and they still tasted pretty good.  Anyone else have a preference?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''electron transport chain''' is a system of molecules through which electrons are transferred to generate ATP.  It has an important role in both photosynthesis and cellular respiration.

'''ETS in photosynthesis'''

In photosynthesis, when you are absorbed in photosystem 2, electrons are energized.  They are transferred to the reaction center.  From the reaction center, the electrons enter the electron transport chain and pass the etransport chain molecules.  Then the 2 deenergized electrons are reenergized in Photosystem 1 (is second because PSII was discovered first)and they go to the NAPD+ reductase which transfers ther electrons to a coenzyme, converting it to NADPH+ The two electrons used must be replaced, so water is broken down producing 2 protons (H+) which concentrate in the thylakoid membrane, 2 electrons replaced in PSII and oxygen released as O2. Protons go down proton pumps and a concentration gradient forms as protons move from the stroma into the thylakoid space. Protons move down gradient through ATP synthase which forms ATP.  Energy is stored.

'''ETS in respiration'''
In respiration, an electron transport chain is used to break the fall of electrons to oxygen into several energy-releasing steps. It slows down the releasing process of energy. There are a number of molecules that consists an electron transport chain. Most of these molecules are proteins, built into the inner membrane of mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the plasma membrane of aerobically respiring prokaryotes. On the &quot;top&quot; end of the chain, where the energy is highest, electrons removed from oxidation of glucose are shuttled by NADH. On the &quot;bottom&quot; end, where the energy is lowest, Oxygen molecules pick up the electrons, and together with protons existing in the cellular environment, oxygen molecules form water. The total energy released from the oxidation of glucose by oxygen is huge, about 2880kJ/mol. (The overall oxidation of glucose is shown by reaction C6H12O6 (aq) + 6 O2 (g) → 6 CO2 (g) + 6 H2O). This energy can't be picked up by cells in a short amount of time. Therefore, electron transport chain applies a cascade of reactions to slowly release the energy, maximizing the usage of glucose. In the cascade, each &quot;downhill&quot; carrier is more electronegative than their &quot;uphill&quot; neighbors, so that the electrons can be passed &quot;downhill&quot; by oxidation. Oxygen is the last electron acceptor. 
&lt;br /&gt;
:There are four unique electron carrier complexes in the respiratory chain:
::Complex I: NADH dehydrogenase
:::*Composed of 42 different polypeptide chains.
:::*Has several Fe-S centers.
:::*NADH + H + FMN &lt;---&gt; NAD + FMNH2
:::*Transfers 2 electrons from NADH to Q.
:::*Pumps 4 protons from matrix to IMS.
::Complex II: Succinate Dehydrogense
:::*Transfers 2 electrons from succinate to coenzyme Q.
:::*Contains 4 different protein subunits:
:::::Subunit A: FAD, succinate binding
:::::Subunit B: 3 Fe-S centers
:::::Subunit C: integral membrane protein, Q binding
:::::Subunit D: does not participate in electron transfer to Q, instead reduces the frequency of some leaking electrons form reactive oxygen Species: ROS.
::Complex III: Ubiquinone Cytochrome C Oxidoreductase
:::*Composed of 22 subunits: heme groups and Fe-S centers
:::*Transfers of 2 electrons QH2 to Cytochrome C.
:::*Pumps 4 protons into IMS.
::Complex IV: Cytochrome C Oxidase 
:::*Contains 13 subunits, prosthetic groups such as cytochromes and Fe-S centers.
:::*Transfers 2 electrons from cytochrome C to oxygen, reducing it to H2O.
:::*Pumps 2 protons into IMS

      <text xml:space="preserve">Going to the [[commons:Category:Chinese_pronunciation|Chinese pronunciation Category]] on [[commons:Wikicommons|Wikicommons]], you will find hundreds of short audio recordings from native speakers, most with the pinyin and tone marks on their info pages or within the filename. Download some to hear the differences in the tones. Try clicking one with your eyes closed or having someone else choose a word so that you can test your listening skills by guessing the tones that were said.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Game theory can be traced back to Babylonian times, in the so called ''Marriage Contract Problem'', although this was only recognised as such in 1985.  Game Theory really began to emerge as a subject in the 1900s.  Firstly by Ernst Zermelo in his paper ''Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf die Theorie des Schachspiels'' (&quot;On the Application of Set Theory to the Theory of Chess&quot;) of 1913, in which the first 'theorem' of game theory was published.  This theory (known as Zermelo's Theorem) states that in the game of chess either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw.


The field came into being properly with the 1944 classic ''Theory of Games and Economic Behavior'' by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern.

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Wikibooks gazette home]] | [[Wikibooks talk:Wikibooks gazette|Discuss]] | [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Bulletin board]] | [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|Subscription list]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Urban Forestry - An Introductory Text of Public and Private Urban Forest Management==
Robert G. Underwood,
Associate Professor of Forestry,
Minot State University - Bottineau Campus,
and all interested parties.

This is text for students at the freshman and sophomore college level.  The scope and content will be based on statements made a few years ago by Dr. Alex Shigo, a noted USFS and private tree health researcher.  Dr. Shigo remarked that it was impossible to cover all the material needed for an individual to most jobs during a short college career.  He suggested that textbooks and courses needed to change to teaching awareness type materials.  Students are made aware of the principles involved in the profession, but the details are left to be covered in the employers orientation and on-the-job training sessions.  Each employer specializes in slightly different areas, the details of each company and setting will be too varied and specific to be covered in a college text.  

With this in mind, I hope we can can create an urban forestry text that highlights the important concepts needed to get a sound start in both the public and private sectors of the &quot;urban forest&quot;.

We're always happy to have new [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|Wikibookians]] with a serious interest in improving articles!

== Naming policy ==
Could you look at this because frankly a book called [[Page name]] is not that useful --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:49, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the reply.  Where do I change the page name.  I have been looking or a couple of days.  I really want this project to work.  

Bob
:You found it - fine - --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:38, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
 
Got lucky on that one.  Now exactly how do I put Urban Forestry on the book shelves?  That is eluding me at the moment.  Bob
:Your own sandbox is a good place to work - I've taken the liberty of making you a link to yours on your user page.  Check it out and you will see how it was done too --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:23, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

Herby,  How do I get the text &quot;Urban Forestry&quot; to appear in the bookshelves?  Does it have to be there before I invite others to help with the editing?   Hope this looks like a worthwhile project.</text>

* ''Tengo diecisiete gatos''
*: I have 17 cats.
* ''Hay treinta y cinco aulas''
*: There are 35 classrooms.
* ''Tengo noventa y seis primos.''
*: I have 96 cousins.
* ''Hay veintidos alumnos en esta clase.''

Abnormal Sexual Psychology (or ASP) is a college-level text that is intended to cover the specialized study of DSM-IV recognized paraphilia. This book is written for both a person who is familiar with psychology and who has some knowledge of the clinical disorders in question. if you are unfamiliar with paraphilia, the book serves as a primer and explanation.

Specifically, the book covers:

* What paraphilias are
* What paraphilias are recognized as aberrant or abnormal by DSM-IV
* The effects these paraphilias have on mental health
* Related mental disorders and resultant psychological effects
* Diagnosing paraphiliac behaviors and discrimination of true paraphilia and fetishism. 

'''This book may contain graphic descriptions of acts that some readers will find morally objectionable'''. A further discussion can be found in the Warning Section.

Abnormal Sexual Psychology (or ASP) covers [[w:Paraphilia|paraphilia]], which are unusual, dangerous, illegal or otherwise abnormal sexual attractions. The descriptions used in discussing these disorders is '''not censored'''. This may include graphic images of a highly sexual nature, discussions of topics that some may consider unpleasant such as necrophilia or pedophilia, and terminology which would be hard to explain to younger children. 

If you find something objectionable in this book, please do not remove it or comment to the editors or authors on it. The book is a study and text on objectionable actions and attractions, and commentary on the obvious is  not constructive. 
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Abnormal Sexual Psychology}}

== ASP MOS ==
=== Style of Writing ===

Try to write in a clear, concise style. Use correct psychological terms, but make sure to explain such terms immediately afterward. Avoid interwiki links when possible.

=== References ===

References should use standard MOS formatting, but the bibliography should use APA style. 

=== Templates ===

There are three specificalities this text uses.

==== Informational Template ====

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:ASPinfo|Example Title|Example Info}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; produces:

{{ASPinfo|Example Title|Example Info}}

This should be used when blocking text off as separate information. If discussing masochism (sexual arousal from pain) and you want to sidetrack into algonagnia (sexual pleasure and orgasm ''from'' pain), you would use it:

{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:#eeeeee; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Exquisite-khelpcenter.png|right|20px]]'''Algolagnia and Masochism'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
It's important to remember that algonagnia is not a paraphilia, but a biological nerve dysfunction. Masochists are aroused by specific kinds of pain, but algolagniacs can be brought to orgasm through pain even if they aren't aroused.

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==== DSM-IV Quote Template ====

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:DSMIVinfo|Example Entry|Example Text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; produces:

{{DSMIVinfo|Example Entry|Example Text}}

This is a '''short''' cite of the DSM-IV, or content relating to the DSM-IV's stance on a paraphilia. This should ONLY be used when:

#to directly quote the DSM-IV in a definition of a scientific term. This cite should be '''very limited in scope''' when possible.
#to discuss the DSM-IV &quot;viewpoint&quot; on a topic, '''without a direct cite'''.
#the DSM-IV makes an asseration that is in conflict with mainstream views on the subject. For example, in dealing with Voyeurism:

{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:steelblue; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Application-x-executable.svg|right|20px]]'''DSM-IV on : Voyeurism'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
While popular culture likes to describe voyeurs as peeping toms who can't get a date or make significant relationships work, the DSM-IV shows that voyeurism is the most common of all paraphilias, with the highest rate of normal exclusivity out of all paraphilias. At least 55% of men and 30% of women admitted in studies to be aroused by acts that meet the standard of voyeurism. Some argue that this makes voyeurism simply a behavior and not a paraphilia.

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==== Controversial Template ====

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:ASPControversy|Example Issue|Example Controversy}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; produces:

{{ASPControversy|Example Issue|Example Controversy}

This should be used when there is significant disagreement in ''professiona'' psychological circles about a paraphilia , or the view of psychology on a specific cause or trait of a paraphilia. This should be used sparingly. An example dealing with pedophilia would be:

{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:orange; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Dialog-warning.svg|right|20px]]'''Pedophilia and Asexuality : Controversy'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
There is some research indicating that paraphilia is common among those who, whether by choice or vocation, are restricted from normal sexual activity. DSM-IV does not recognize such a link, but studies are still ongoing.

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

==== DSM-IV Direct Cite Template ====

'''Warning:''' Unless you are '''''very''''' familiar with what is and isn't allowed to be fair use quoted from the DSM-IV, do '''not''' use this template or quote directly from the DSM-IV. The DSM-IV is widely avaialble as excerpts on the Internet as long as it is only 

*The diagnostic code
*The summary
*The etiology
*The treatment options

The extended analysis, diagnostic guide, point-by-point criteria, and the like '''cannot be directly quoted''' under fair use. 

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:Template:DSMCite|example cite}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; produces:

{{DSMCite|example cite}}

This should '''only''' be used in the [[Abnormal Sexual Psychology/TOC#DSM-IV Definitions|section that directly speaks about DSM-IV Definitions]].

==Direct Cites==

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Filter access==
On the 1992-1995 Honda Civic with the D16 engine, the oil filter is located on the back side of the engine, beneath the intake manifold, making access difficult from above. The best method is to use a &quot;cup type&quot; oil filter wrench which fits the flutes on the end of the filter, an extension of appropriate length, and a ratchet handle; this assembly is wormed down through the very narrow space between intake manifold and firewall and onto the filter. The job can be complicated somewhat if an oil filter which has a different size than the stock Honda filter has been installed, as is the case with some of the national oil-change chains; and/or if the filter refuses to be removed, either because of overtightening when installed, too long a time lapse since installation, or, sometimes, use of oil leak sealant additives, which can cause the rubber seal on the filter to adhere tightly to the block the same way they cause rubber gaskets to seal more tightly.

The B16 engine, however, which was an option in some del Sols of this vintage and is a popular engine swap into other Civic models, offers significantly more space between the intake manifold and the firewall, easing the job of filter replacement from above.

==Oil drain plug==
The oil drain plug can be a source of problems. The stock plug uses an aluminum crush washer to seal against leaks, which must be torqued fairly tightly (the same system is used on the manual transmission fill and drain plugs). Contrary to occasional practice, the washer should '''never''' be reused except as a temporary measure in an emergency, as it then requires even more torque to properly seal. Given the relatively high torque needed to properly seal the plug, it is not unusual for the plug to be overtightened and the threads stripped; luckily, it is usually the plug which is damaged and can be replaced, rather than the more complex process of fixing damaged threads in the oil pan. 

Some enterprising mechanics substitute a nylon washer,as is sometimes found on other cars, rather than the aluminum washer; the torque required for proper sealing is greatly lessened, but the nylon has a tendency to soften when hot and creep out from under the plug, so that leaks develop over time, particularly in warmer temperatures. The Valvoline national oil-change chain offers a replacement plug with an integrated O-ring (often prominently displayed for sale in the office of the facility, given the well known problem of stripping of Honda oil plugs) which requires much less torque and can be reused several times; after a few reuses, however, the O-ring can become worn and damaged and the plug must be replaced. The danger of stripping of the threads is greatly reduced, however.

One possible solution is to install one of the oil drain valves, available either from Fumoto or Fram. These take the place of the stock drain plug, by threading into the oil pan, and utilize a valve which is turned by hand to drain the engine oil. While tapping the drain hole and installing a larger plug, or installing a self-tapping plug are acceptable, they are not the recommended solution, as these types of plugs tend develop leaks over a short period of time. Also, the metal shavings created by the tap may become suspended in the remaining oil, causing premature engine wear. The proper repair, if the threads for the drain plug in the oil pan become stripped, is to replace the engine oil pan altogether.

      <text xml:space="preserve">According to the service manual, the 1992-1995 Civic engine has a drain plug for the coolant system on the side of the block, in addition to the drain at the bottom of the radiator; it is approximately in the center of the front side of the engine, beneath the exhaust manifold. This plug is extremely tightly seated, has a very shallow head, and direct access is blocked; making it almost impossible to remove, even with an appropriately sized 6 point socket (if it is successfully removed, the head is usually severely rounded off in the process, thus it is advisable to have a new replacement on hand before the job is begun).

In practice, therefore, very few mechanics (even in dealer service areas) attempt to open this drain during a coolant replacement, relying instead on the radiator drain and flushing the old coolant out with water. In fact, many dealer service mechanics and part departments do not even know of the existence of this block drain until it is shown to them in the manual. However, since the block cannot be completely drained without removal of the plug, and since Honda coolant is sold pre-diluted and ready for use rather than in concentrated form, there remains the choice of diluting the new coolant with the water remaining in the block, or wasting some expensive coolant flushing the remnants of the water out of the block. Most mechanics who have attempted to remove the plug from the block, however, will choose one of these two alternatives in future.

== Paraphilia and Society ==

I started writing this book when I was in college, in 1986, with five other psychology students and Dr. Earl Harper, who was a researcher involved in studying paraphilias. This was when DSM-III was in use, and the revision had just come out. 

Dr. Harper was concerned about the lack of research into the actual structure of paraphilia, especially it's effects on mental health and the larger psychocultural issues surrounding how paraphiliacs were treated. Of the six students helping him, four of us had at least one paraphilia. I was the only one who had multiple paraphilias, plus other problems.

Originally, this was a supplemental text he was designing for a PSYC 6 - Abnormal Psychology class. However, he worked more on trying to find various theories that would fit problems with what he saw as bilaterial shifts in how the brain interpreted arousal. The entirety of his theories, which were interesting but undocumented and relied too much on a subset of DSM-III that is no longer supported, do not appear in this book.

What does appear is the extremely solid and detailed groundwork we developed to have a fundamental understanding of exactly what paraphilia is, and what effects it has on mental health. This book is a primer to this specific aspect of abnormal psychology. It is usually glossed over in lower level college classes due to the nature of it being distasteful to some people. Research is hindered due to the fact that some people will never admit publicly to some of the more extreme paraphilias. Some of them are criminal, or even inimical to human ideas about what is decent.

This text is intended to give a reader with no serious background in abnormal psychology a good understanding of what paraphilias are, how the DSM-IV treats them, and what relationships they have with our present day culture and psychological and mental health. It draws no conclusions, and should be used only as a textbook and not as a guide. For those with no background in psychology, the tone and terminology used are kept as non-clinical as possible without compromising accuracy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==This book==

This is a reference textbook, intended for college level students interested in abnormal psychology and sexology. It is a bit dry for beginners, but those who actually have paraphilias may find it useful. 

The scope of this book is definition and explaination, not original research. Everything must be verified. 

Articles from Wikipedia will not be used due to a lack of sureity in proper adherance to the topic we are discussing. --[[User:Elaragirl|Elaragirl]] 16:54, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Paraphilia ==

Everyone has heard about them. Everyone has seen talk shows discussing them, or heard something about a person in the news. A Catholic priest accused of molesting children. A man arrested for exposing himself. Giggling teenage boys watching the neighbor's wife with binoculars. The scene in Pulp Fiction talking about foot massages. 

Psychology touches on every aspect of human activity, and sexuality is no different. But just as psychology must sometimes touch on the arcane and the abnormal, so does sexuality follow. '''Paraphilia''' is what psychological experts call sexual attraction to or arousal from inappropriate activities or inappropriate sex partners.  Many of these are illegal if the person acts on his fantasies, such as Pedophilia (sexual attraction to prepubescent children) and Exhibitionism (exposing oneself to a person who did not consent to it).  This is in contrast to a Fetish, which is a sexual preoccupation with an inanimate object such as women's panties or shoes.

A Paraphila is a mental disorder, as described by the '''''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''''', the book of criteria for diagnosing and segregating psychological abnormalities. The DSM has had four major revisions, the current version being the DSM-IV-TR. As the standardized manual of recognizing and diagnosing such ailments, this book relies on the DSM-IV for information.

{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:steelblue; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Application-x-executable.svg|right|20px]]'''DSM-IV on : Paraphilia'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
The DSM-IV classifies paraphilias as ''Axis I'' disorders, meaning that they are clinical disorders that one develops over time and might eventually be cured of, as compared to Axis II conditions which are expected to be a constant through one's life such as Mental Retardation, Personality Disorders, and Developmental Disorders such as Autism.

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

== So ... paraphilia? ==

This book covers paraphilia from a clinical viewpoint. The DSM-IV definition of Paraphilia follows: 
{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:steelblue; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Application-x-executable.svg|right|20px]]'''DSM-IV on : Paraphilia Definition '''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
The sexual arousal and excitement by a specific action, type of fantasy, sexual urge, or behavior that both a) deviate markedly from standardized behavioral norms in sexual psychology in such a way that they require external stimulus and b) that if repressed, are known to create clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Individuals who have such impulses, fantasies, etc. but do not act on them can be considered to fall into this category as well.

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

To state it more clearly, a paraphila is the act of deriving sexual arousal from activity that is either difficult to reciprocate or otherwise radically different from what a vast majority of people are aroused by. Some of the minor paraphilias are so bizarre that they could double as minor psychoses. Just because you feel an urge to do something doesn't mean you have a paraphilia, though. Most people with paraphilia have ''strong'' urges to do what they feel.

== Why is paraphilia important? ==

Paraphilia is rapidly becoming a major driving force in cultural change. Emboldened by the transition of homosexuality from being seen as a mental illness to a condition, many paraphiliacs are more open about their preferences. In some cases, this is harmless. Fetish paraphilias, like plushophilia or shoe fetishism, is pretty much a non-issue. But many paraphilias are far from benign, and many involve the ''injury or non-consenting interaction'' of other people. 

Considering the numbers of people believed to have pedophiliac, ephebophiliac, or pyrophiliac tendencies are estimated to be well above 300 million, this is not an issue to be set to the side. Nor are other paraphilias to be dismissed. 

Paraphilia is also important due to the fact that, in terms of how the DSM-IV examines the facts, people who suffer from these conditions are classified, at least to some degree, as mentally ill. It is estimated that there are 15 to 40 million Americans with paraphiliac tendencies in one fashion or another. Yet there is almost no effort to educate mainstream America about the conditions of paraphilia, or it's dangers, or how to deal with paraphiliacs. 

As someone who has multiple paraphilias and obsessive compulsive disorders related to said paraphilias, it is important to the writer of this introduction that people have a thorough understanding of paraphilia, in all aspects, but most critically in how the mainstream psychological community looks at it. That is why this book mainly considers only DSM-IV recognized paraphilias, and not more outrageous fetishes that don't have a psychological component.

[[Image:Patagonia.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Lago Espejo, in Argentina.]]

== Articles ==
As in many languages, Spanish gives each noun a gender: '''masculine''' or '''feminine''', both for singular things and plural ones.

Spanish, like English, has two articles: the definite article (&quot;the&quot;) and the indefinite article (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;). However, there are 4 forms, depending on the number and gender of the noun. The plural indefinite article is &quot;some&quot; in Spanish.

*If the noun ends in a vowel, to make it plural, '''add s'''.
*If the noun ends in a consonant, to make it plural, '''add es'''.

=== Definite articles ===
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Grammar|The definite article|El artículo definido|5}}
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''masculine'''||''singular''||el||el hombre||the man
|-
|''plural''||los||los niños||the boys
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''feminine'''||''singular''||la||la mujer||the woman
|-
|''plural''||las||las niñas||the girls
|-
|}

=== Indefinite articles ===
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Grammar|The indefinite article|El artículo indefinido|5}}
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''masculine'''||''singular''||un||un hombre||a man

|''plural''||unas||unas niñas||some girls
|-
|}

[[/Exercises#Genders|Go to the exercises]].

== Regular verbs ==
We have already seen the present tense conjugations of two Spanish verbs, ''lamarse'' and ''tener''. In Spanish, the conjugation depends on what the last two letters of the infinitive (the form found in the dictionary &amp;mdash; &quot;to run&quot;, &quot;to dance&quot;) are. It may end in &quot;ir&quot;, &quot;er&quot; or &quot;ar&quot;.

To conjugate them in the present tense, you remove the &quot;ir&quot;, &quot;er&quot; or &quot;ar&quot; and then add a suffix. The suffixes are shown below.

* ''Vivir'' (&quot;to live&quot;): vivo, vives, vive, vivimos, vivís, viven

[[/Exercises#Regular verbs|Go to the exercises]].

== Questions and Exclamations ==
In previous lessons, you will have noticed that we use the funny upside-down question mark &quot;¿&quot;. In Spanish, questions always start with that, and finish with the regular question mark. It is the same for excalations; the funny upside-down exclamataion mark &quot;¡&quot; precedes exclamations.

Questions in Spanish are mainly done by intonation (raising the voice at the end of the question), since questions are often identical to statements. ''Te llamas Richard'' means &quot;Your name is Richard&quot;, and ''¿Te llamas Richard?'' means &quot;Is your name Richard?&quot;.

You can also use questions words, as indicated below.
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|Questions|Preguntas|2}}

|-
| ¿Cuándo?

|}

; Examples
* ''¿Con quién?''

* ''¿Dónde está el banco?''
*: Where is the bank?
* ''¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños?''
*: When's your birthday?
* ''¿Qué es la fecha hoy?''
*: What is the date today?
* ''¡Hasta luego!''
*: See you later!

Wouldn't it be better to split each declension into a separate module, with exercises for each? I think learning all the declensions together with no practice exercises is too much for a new learner. - Philip

It is quite normal for cases to be named in the order nom-gen-dat-acc-voc, right? So why not do so here? [[User:Teentje|Teentje]] 13:18, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/{{#ifeq:{{{bb|}}}||ms{{{1}}}|bb{{{bb}}}}}.aspx {{{2}}}]&lt;noinclude&gt;

== Example ==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{MSSQL ref|187745|int}}
{{MSSQL ref|bb=677335|datetime2}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Documentation ==

This template adds a reference to documentation of [[w:Microsoft SQL Server]] in MSDN. URLs in MSDN look like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/msXXXXXX.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where XXXXXX is a decimal number of an article, which might be succeeded with the suffixes:

* no suffix — for articles relevant to latest stable version, i.e. 2008 (AKA 10.0).
* &lt;code&gt;%28SQL.90%29&lt;/code&gt; — for articles on 2005 version (AKA 9.0)
* &lt;code&gt;%28SQL.100%29&lt;/code&gt; — for articles on 2008 version (AKA 10.0) — currently redirects to &quot;no suffix&quot; URL
* &lt;code&gt;%28SQL.105%29&lt;/code&gt; — for articles on 2008 R2 version (AKA 10.5)

Also, there are some non-English translations available, which is designated by adding language and region code (such as &lt;code&gt;de-de,&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;zh-cn,&lt;/code&gt; before &lt;code&gt;SQL.XXX&lt;/code&gt;), thus making URLs like ms

Article number is generally perceived between implementation versions, so it's recommended to just use raw decimal number as an argument for this template and thus we'll automatically reference most stable version in English.

A few articles in newer documentation (particularly for features that appeared in 2008 version) don't use &lt;code&gt;msXXXXXX.aspx&lt;/code&gt; names, but instead might use &lt;code&gt;bbXXXXXX.aspx&lt;/code&gt; — an invocation with named parameter '''bb''' should be used for these rare cases.

Documentation for older versions of SQL Server is still available in MSDN, but they don't share the article number and prefix, although they have suffixes with version numbers (like &lt;code&gt;%28SQL.80%29&lt;/code&gt;). For example, these are the URLs for the same article in modern and old documentation:

* &lt;code&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms187745.aspx&lt;/code&gt; — current stable version
* &lt;code&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa933198%28SQL.80%29.aspx&lt;/code&gt; — 2000 version (AKA 8.0)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Abnormal Sexual Psychology}}

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or the DSM, was created to give concrete terms and diagnostic codes to psychiatrists and psychologists. Prior to this, communication across countries or schools of psychological thought was haphazard at best. In order to codify things, a group of psychologists in the APA created the first version of the DSM. 

The DSM breaks disorders down into classifications, decided on by psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health professionals. Most of the DSM's classifications are somewhat arbitrary, since it strongly follows certain psychological theories and schools of thought, and is influenced by insurance companies and even public opinion. 

There are four editions of the DSM. The DSM-I, published in 1952, had about 100 disorders, mostly mainline conditions. Unsatisfied with the limits, DSM-II was published in the late 60's, with about 150 disorders. Early versions of the DSM were based on the demarcation between psychosis and neurosis.

This approach was broken in 1980 , and replaced with the biomedical psychology model, and lead to the creation of DSM-III. This was followed by a revision in 1986, which is the version that was used in the creation of the notes that lead to this book.In 1994, however, the DSM-IV came out, and updated and changed many criteria from DSM-III and DSM-III-R. 

The DSM-IV is a guide and a diagnostic tool, but not exactly a guide for laypersons. DSM-IV is often used, however, in psychiatric hospitals, by insurance adjustors, even in criminal cases to determine kinds of insanity. It is more precise and more authoritative than other compilations of mental illness and does not suffer from adherence to schools of psychological thought as much. 

The DSM-IV looks at paraphilia as a type of mental disorder, but not on the scale of schitzophrneia or dementia. Basically, paraphilaics are abnormal, but not insane or in need of corrective psychological therapy. There is strong consensus that paraphilia, much like homosexuality, cannot be &quot;cured&quot; or fixed. However, unlike homosexuality, almost all paraphilias are formed during early or late childhood, and not set at birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Repositories of extra software==  	 
 		 
Fedora Core only includes a core set of packages. For downloading and installing programs or [[codec]]s not distributed with Core, there are several [[repository|repositories]] available. Packages are generally compatible between third-party repositories, though this has not always been the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.freshrpms.net/pipermail/freshrpms-list/2003-April/004048.html FreshRPMs mailing list: (non-)compatibility of repositories]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also occasional overlaps or packaging errors that cause one package to negatively affect packages distributed from different repositories. 	 
 		 
=== Official repositories === 	 
 		 
Fedora Core, [[Fedora Extras]] and Fedora Legacy are official repositories in this project. Fedora Core is maintained by Red Hat. Fedora Extras is maintained by a group of volunteers and affiliated with the official Fedora Project. Fedora Extras is currently included in the base distribution as a default repository and no extra configuration is required to enable it. Fedora Legacy repository is also included in Fedora Core 5 and above versions but it is not enabled by default. 	 
 		 
=== Unofficial repositories === 	 
 		 
These repositories are designed to be compatible with Fedora Core although they may not be compatible with each other. Some of the repositories have discontinued active support for earlier versions of Fedora Core but keep the repositories around for the convenience of users with previous versions. 	 
 		 
* [http://rpm.livna.org/ Livna], a third-party repository maintained by a group of packagers, supporting Fedora Core 5 through 14 (as of June 2010). Since it merged in 2008 with two other package repositories into [http://rpmfusion.org/ RPM Fusion], it contains just the libdvdcss-1.2.10-1 package.
: (Must use with Extras. Not compatible with RPMForge repositories.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/apt/FAQ.php#D1 Livna's maintainers have a policy to not work together with other 3rd party repositories] or at least they had this policy when Fedora Extras was Fedora.us&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://liquidat.wordpress.com/2006/03/23/compatibility-and-freshrpms-3/ Matthias Saou explains the compatibility issues between FreshRPMs and Livna]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://rpmforge.net/ RPMforge], containing the packages of Matthias Saou, Dag Wieers and Dries that were previously available in three different repositories, supporting Fedora Core 1 through 5.&lt;ref&gt;FreshRPMS, PlanetCCRMA, Dries and DAG (RPMforge.net) build their packages together from the same sources. This ensures much greater cooperation and compatibility and will eventually lead to a merger.&lt;/ref&gt; RPMforge is compatible with Fedora Extras, similar to Livna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rpmforge.net/user/faq/#compatibility-and-mixing | title=RPMforge: Frequently Asked Questions | accessdate=2006-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [http://freshrpms.net/ FreshRPMS], maintained by Matthias Saou, supporting Fedora Core 1 through 6
** [http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/apt/ Dag], maintained by Dag Wieers, supporting Fedora Core 1 through 3
** [http://dries.studentenweb.org/rpm/ Dries], maintained by Dries Verachtert, supporting Fedora Core 1 through 6
** [http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/ PlanetCCRMA], maintained by Fernando Lopez-Lezcano, supporting Fedora Core 1 through 5
* [http://kde-redhat.sourceforge.net/ kde-redhat], Excellent source for KDE support in Fedora Core maintained by a group of packagers that support Fedora Core. Has updated KDE desktop RPMS, general KDE applications such as [[Bluetooth]] support.
* [http://rpm.greysector.net/ The Grey Sector], containing mostly [[MPlayer]] related packages and binary packaged codecs (which have some legal issues). The repository is maintained by the MPlayer developer.
* [http://fedoraxgl.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Installation_en fedora-xgl], containing packages required to enable [[Xgl]] on Fedora.
* [http://dribble.org.uk/ dribble], containing packages with a focus on fun software (multimedia, games, emulators). It is recommended that this repository be used with Livna.
* [http://atrpms.net/ ATrpms], maintained by Axel Thimm and supporting Fedora Core 1 through 6.
:* Updates base packages ahead of Core. Some administrators consider it a bad idea to update base packages outside of their official channel.
:* ATrpms is also used extensively by [http://wilsonet.com/mythtv/fcmyth.php Fedora Myth(TV)ology] - a popular how-to resource for installing MythTV on Fedora Core, maintained by [[Jarod Wilson]].

==Legal status==

Fedora Core, Fedora Extras and Fedora Legacy projects follow the same packaging guidelines in the Fedora project, and they all only maintain packages that are Free, open source software and legally distributable anywhere in the world. Other repositories may have different policies. For example, the Livna project maintains packages that may have legal issues within the United States or can be downloaded only by the end user.

Some repositories also maintain &quot;source-only&quot; packages that require the user to download pre-built binaries that may not be available to the public. The package script then unpacks and repacks the binaries in a format more suitable for deployment on RPM-based systems.

==Software update utilities==

The main tool to install software from repositories is the command yum. A graphical tool called pirut (available in the upper menu bar with the name &quot;Package Manager&quot;) is, together with the update program pup (&quot;Package Update&quot;), part of the standard installation since Fedora Core 5. Since FC6, a new mechanism for updates was added, based on a daemon called yum-updatesd that scans the repositories, and a notification applet called puplet that notifies the user about the new updates.

In addition to these standard tools, two graphical alternatives - Yumex [9] and Synaptic - are also available, in Extras. There is also Kyum, which provides a graphical frontend for KDE users.

By default, Fedora Core downloads software (including updates) from a randomly-selected mirror. It is possible to install directly from the Fedora Core CDs or DVD, but this requires changes to yum's configuration files (See off-line repositories below). Altering the configuration in this way is also useful when setting up a local mirror (for example on a company intranet), so that downloads can be obtained from there without having to access a mirror on the Internet.

Up until Fedora Core 4, maintainers of some of the extra repositories advocated the use of apt-rpm for update management - being written in C, it uses fewer CPU cycles and is therefore suitable for older computers with slower processors. For Fedora Core 5, a new version of apt is included in Extras which is capable of using native yum metadata and is multi-lib capable. [6]

Another useful tool to work with repositories is Fedora Helper [10]. It installs and configures the &quot;missing codecs&quot; - MP3 support, for example. It uses the rpm.livna.org repository. Another tool that helps when using different repositories together is Fedora Frog.[11]

==Off-line repositories==

If a machine needs to be updated that is not connected to the network, a repository can be created and updated from there. To create such a portable repository do [7]:

* make the directories ./yum, ./yum/base and ./yum/updates. (if you want your local apache to serve as repository of your intranet, do it inside /var/www/html)
* copy all RPMs of your distribution inside ./base
* create the headers of the packets with the command createrepo ./base (use /var/www/html/yum/base if you did set it for Apache)
* download the updates. To do that, look for a real mirror (there is a list of them here [8]) and rsync with it to pick up changes (they will be stored in the ./updates repository). To rsync use the command rsync -avrt rsync://repository --exclude=debug/ /your-path/yum/updates

To use the off-line repository from a computer you only have to include in the /etc/yum/repos.d directory an entry (a *.repo file like the others already in /etc/yum/repos.d) specifying the path to the repository. You can use ftp, http or a mounted filesystem. In the latter case the repository path should start with &quot;file://&quot;.

{{recipe|Out of Salad Dressing Salad Dressing}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

&quot;This is a recipe I created when I realized that our bottled salad dressing was frozen and couldn't thaw quickly enough. It is very easy to make from ingredients usually already on hand. You can vary the amounts, or even substitute low-fat ingredients according to your personal taste. Tastes even better when chilled over night!&quot;

==Ingredients==
* 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], juiced 
* 1 cup freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]]
* 2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Garlic Salt|garlic salt]]
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]

==Procedure==
# Mix together lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, garlic salt, and mayonnaise until smooth. Stir in milk, adjusting the amount or adding a little water, to make the dressing as thin or thick as you like. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Instead of garlic salt, crush a clove of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] and mix into the dressing with a little [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] (to taste).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What kind of fish?==
Can anyone suggest what kind of fish would be used for this dish? [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 20:49, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
Actually I've just noticed the recipe doesn't mention eating the fish fillets. Should it? [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 20:53, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
:I'd reckon that most whole fish would be suitable, except the particularly [[Cookbook:Fish|oily ones]] (although I'm rather partial to some of the oily fish too &amp;ndash; mullet goes nicely in a Thai green curry!) As to eating the fillets, absolutely! You put the fish on top of the rice, and pour some of the broth over it. A quick [http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Sayyadieh Google] finds several examples of this recipe.

== Overview ==

Once again we join [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry Potter]] as he enters what would be his seventh year at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. The book is written from the point-of-view of the now 17-year-old Harry as he prepares to complete the mission set for him by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] at the end of the previous year. Arguably the darkest book in the series, this volume shows [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] tightening his grip on the Wizarding world as he remolds it into his own pure-blood design.

While the series progressively covers seven years in Harry Potter's life, the first five volumes are largely self-contained stories. Unlike them, this book is written more as the second half to a two-part novel, and is tightly tied to the previous book, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']].

Note: While this book is among the longer ones in the series, at 607 pages (Bloomsbury / Raincoast edition), it is also set in somewhat larger type. If it were the same size type as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], it would be 520 pages (approximately) to 223 for ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''.

== Be Bold ==
This guideline proposal is static now, in recent times it only got tweaked a bit and I think to the best and to make it clearer. I archived previous post threads about making it a policy or a guideline (and they are important as some users may still have problems making a distinction on the two), I think the argument to make it a guideline won and is stated as much on the draft any one has any other point we should consider before we make a decission on this ?&lt;br&gt;
I have suggested that [[User:Robert Horning]] puts it through the motions he proposed on the [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AStaff_lounge%2FChat&amp;diff=805233&amp;oldid=805177 Wikibooks:Staff lounge/Chat #Moving on policies]] as a test run sense no other way is defined as standard. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

:I have created a basic voting page for this to become a formal guideline here:  [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/Be Bold]]

:I think this is rather non-controvercial, and certainly need to get some sort of formal acceptance.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:12, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

: Does Wikipedia itself have the be bold ( or similiar) guideline? [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 14:29, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

::Yes they do; see [[w:Wikipedia:Be_bold|here]]. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 14:32, 6 February 2008 (UTC)
::: Thanks [[User:ChessCreator|ChessCreator]] ([[User talk:ChessCreator|talk]]) 15:35, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

== Shortcut ==

The shortcut to this page is WB:BOLD, but WP:BB is used for the same policy on Wikipedia. Since WB:BB goes to the Bulletin Board, I'm going to put a link on the Bulletin Board so that Wikipedibookians looking for this page might more easily find it. '''[[User:Neoptolemus|Νεοπτόλεμος]]''' 15:47, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

:As long as we don't have a hyperactive deletionist kill the redirects, that shouldn't be a problem.  And yes, there has been massive deletion of redirects in the past that I won't go into.  Since many wikipedians are more familiar with the &quot;WP:&quot; psuedoprefix, I think this is a good idea. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 16:01, 7 February 2008 (UTC)

== Wikijunior ==

Shouldn't there be a Wikijunior version, considering that there is a link to this page on the main Wikijunior page? That way, it would be easier to understand. This is mainly easy to understand, but it could be simplified some more to be easier for them. (Check my Wikipedia user page.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">When camping in an area that does not have running water and toilets, you must either bring water with you, or bring along the means for purifying water you collect when you arrive.  Do not assume that because a stream or lake looks clean that it is OK to drink.  In general, it is not, and drinking it without treating it carries a high risk of causing diarrhea or vomiting.

When camping in an area that does have running water, make sure that ''it'' is OK for drinking.  If you see a sign that says &quot;Non-potable Water,&quot; that means that it is NOT OK to drink.  Rather, non-potable water is only suitable for flushing toilets and washing hands.  

Do not brush your teeth, cook with, or drink non-potable water without purifying it first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If camping at a facility that has toilets, use them.  If camping in the wilderness, you will have to either build a latrine or use cat holes.  Do &quot;your business&quot; at least {{units|60 meters|200 feet}} away from any source of water (such as a spring, river, or lake), and at least {{units|30 meters|100 feet}} away from your camp.  Dig a shallow hole {{units|7-10cm|3-4 inches}} deep and go there.  Then bury it (and any toilet paper).  At this depth, there is a lot of bacteria in the soil to quickly compost your waste.  Digging deeper will make it take longer.

Just because you are camping does not mean you are at liberty to skip personal hygiene.  Wash your hands before you eat and after you answer &quot;nature's call.&quot;  Brush your teeth before you go to bed and after breakfast.  Wash your face and clean your fingernails.

Keep your kitchen clean too, and wash your dishes as soon as you finish eating.  Dishes should be washed with hot, soapy, potable water.  A few drops of bleach should be added to your rinse water.  It's a good idea to heat dish washing water while preparing meals so that it is ready to use as soon as there are dirty dishes to wash.  Be sure the water is not hot enough to scald anyone's hands.  Cold water and boiling water can be mixed half-and-half for a comfortable washing temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You should never go camping without a first aid kit.  Be prepared for any emergencies that may arise.  Know where you can find help from the police and where the nearest hospital is ''before'' you need to use their services.  Many remote areas and camp grounds do not have good cell phone service, so do not rely on your cell phone to get you out of trouble.  

Every Pathfinder and staff member should carry a medical release form with them at all times during a campout, so that if an emergency arises, medical personnel will have proper authorization to begin treatment.  These forms should be signed and dated in the ''recent'' past - no more than a few months ago.  Additionally, ''all'' staff should carry medical release forms for ''all'' the Pathfinders under their charge ''at all times'' during a campout.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Warm Weather Clothing'''

Keep in mind that the weather can change suddenly though.  Just because it is warm when you begin your outing does not mean it will be warm the whole time.  If there is a chance that the weather will turn cold, take along some cold weather gear as well.  Check an almanac to see how cold it can get during the time you are planning to be out.  

Here is a list of clothing appropriate for a warm-weather outing.  
* Thick socks
* Jeans
* Light Shirt (short sleeve)
* Light Shirt (long sleeve)
* Hat with a wide brim
* Boots

'''Cold Weather Clothing'''
Remember to dress in layers.  This will allow you to control your temperature better.  In cold weather, you do not want to sweat, because that will soak your clothing and chill you.  If you find yourself working up a sweat, remove a layer of clothing, or open a zipper.  Rely on wool rather than on cotton, because wool stays warm even when wet.  There is a popular saying among experienced outdoorsmen that &quot;Cotton kills.&quot;  This is because when cotton gets wet, it steals the body's heat which can lead to hypothermia and death.  Your outer layer should be wind-proof, as this greatly increases the warmth of your clothing.  Here is a list:
* Thermal Underwear
* Light shirts (polyester or some other synthetic)
* Heavy Shirts
* Wool Sweater
* Wind Breaker
* Fleece Pants (synthetic)
* Nylon Pants (as the outside layer) or snow pants
* Overcoat
* Wool Socks
* Boots
* Warm Hat

'''Sleepwear'''
For comfortable sleeping and for modesty on overnight trips, bring pajamas or a sweat suit.  In many places where it is warm during the day it gets cold at night, so be prepared.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is the Urban Forest? ==
If we look for an ecological definition of a forest, we may find that it is an association of all the plants,animals and geological features that occur in a landscape dominated by trees.  If we look around the world, we find that the degree of this domination by trees varies greatly, between the rain forests of the tropics and the savanna oak forests of the prairie edges of the temperate regions.  The switch from this definition to one of the urban forest, requires only that we add man as a major animal and various anthropological features to the geological ones.  Ecologically, every feature has some effect on every other part of the system.  If they are in balance, the system is working properly.

==Who is the Urban Forester?==
As the forester is charged with managing the forest, so is the urban forester charged with managing that portion of our forest which is impacted by trees.  The urban forester is sometimes referred to an an arborist.  I believe that there is a significant distinction between the two careers.  I have heard the arborist defined as one who facilitates the coexistence  of people and trees.  The arborist deals with the care of trees, much as a medical specialist.  The urban forester is more along the lines of the hospital administrator, while he/she may also be a doctor, they are also a politician, lawyer, personnel manager, and bookkeeper, among other things.

== Paraphilia ==

A paraphilia is being aroused by factors considered non-standard by mainstream society. 

=== Clinical Meaning ===

{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:steelblue; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Application-x-executable.svg|right|20px]]'''DSM-IV on : Paraphilia Definition'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
Paraphilias all have in common distressing and repetitive sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors.  These fantasies, urges, or behaviors must occur for a significant period of time and must interfere with either satisfactory sexual relations or everyday functioning if the diagnosis is to be made.  There is also a sense of distress within these individuals.  In other words, they typically recognize the symptoms as negatively impacting their life but feel as if they are unable to control them.

&lt;/div&gt;
|} 

The DSM-IV classifies paraphilias as an Axis II disorder.{{ref|dsmref}}. This means they are viewed as clinical syndromes or symptomatic personality functions that are evidenced in long lasting symptoms. Typically, all Axis II conditions are believed to affect all parts of the individual's way of interacting with the world, and are called ''pervasive''. [The DSM-TR-IV identifies paraphilias as Axis I disorders.  The only disorders recorded on Axis II are Personality Disorders and Mental Retardation.  Please check DSM-IV-TR, pg. 28 for clarification.]

Clinically speaking, paraphilias are put in the same category as paranoia, antisocial disorders, and personality disorders.

====Paraphilia as disorder====

{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:steelblue; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Application-x-executable.svg|right|20px]]'''DSM-IV on : Personality Disorders'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
Personality Disorders are mental illnesses that share several unique qualities.  They contain symptoms that are enduring and play a major role in most, if not all, aspects of the person's life.  While many disorders vacillate in terms of symptom presence and intensity, personality disorders typically remain relatively constant.

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

In short, paraphilias are considered to be a component of the person's entire psychological makeup. They cannot be &quot;fixed&quot;, but their effects can be suppressed. They should not be looked at as mere preferences. They are seen as being ''pervasive'', as mentioned above, affecting all components of a person's lifestyle, thinking, and emotional states.

A person can like looking at naked members of the opposite sex, and get aroused by this. This is natural behavior. But such a person could also get aroused by risqué talk, or while the person touches them in an erotic manner, or in anticipation of sexual contact in absence of any other arousing factors. 

A person with a paraphilia, on the other hand, has varying levels of difficulty in becoming aroused when their specific trigger is not present. A &quot;standard&quot; pedophile might be able to become aroused by normal members of the opposite sex. An &quot;exclusive&quot; pedophile is unable to become aroused at all except by a pre-adolescent member of the opposite sex.{{ref|pedo}}  

The reason this is a disorder is that paraphilias tend to skew a person's entire way of thinking. A person with exclusively masochistic tendencies will be unable to function in a relationship without such overtones. They will be incapable of keeping such desires hidden from their sexual partners, and in some cases, may need to engage in autoerotic satisfaction of such desires merely to get through the day. This takes it beyond a mere ''preference'' or something that is enjoyed.

The other reason this is classified as a disorder is that the person with a paraphilia has no ability to control their desires. Pyrophilia is extremely dangerous both for the risk of arson and to the person suffering it, but pyrophiliacs are unable to control themselves. 

There is research indicating that paraphiliacs have higher libidos than normal people, and are more likely to experience sexual addictions related to their paraphilia. {{ref|sexstudy}}

| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:#eeeeee; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Exquisite-khelpcenter.png|right|20px]]'''Disorders diagnosed'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
To be diagnosed with a disorder that falls under Axis II, a psychologist has to find the following:

*Symptoms have been for a long period of time, don't vary, and aren't a symptom of some other disorder.
*The history of symptoms can be traced back to adolescence or at least early adulthood. 
*The symptoms have caused and continue to cause significant distress or negative consequences in different aspects of the person's life. 
*Symptoms are seen in at least two of the following areas: Thoughts, Emotions, Control, Interpersonal Relationships

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

====Levels of Exclusivity====

Each type of paraphilia is subclassified (by individual) on the level of ''exclusivity'' the person demonstrates for it. Many psychologists try to find patterns of behavior to distinguish between &quot;levels&quot; of paraphilia, to measure how much the paraphilia affects the individual. 

DSM-IV does not adopt such terminology, but most psychologists agree that there are three levels of paraphiliac exclusivity.

*'''Level One''': Referred to as &quot;standard&quot;, &quot;optional&quot;, and &quot;low level&quot;. 
*'''Level Two''': Referred to as &quot;preferred&quot; and &quot;mid level&quot;.
*'''Level Three''':Referred to as &quot;focused&quot;, &quot;exclusive&quot;, and &quot;high level&quot;.

(For the purposes of this book, we will use the &quot;standard-preferred-focused&quot; line of terminology). 

A person with a standard paraphilia is very strongly aroused by the subject of the paraphilia, but can still find at least some level of arousal through more conventional methods. A masochist may achieve a higher level of arousal through pain, but can still be aroused normally. This is the lowest functional level of paraphilia, and is the most common. However, indulging in the paraphilia results in the activity becoming more and more preferred. Most fantasies involve the paraphilia, but they are rarely acted on, or if acted on are kept hidden and quiet. 

A person with a preferred paraphilia is extremely aroused by the subject of the paraphilia, and achieves primary arousal through that means. They can only achieve arousal through conventional methods with great difficulty, and sexual relations may fail if conducted without referral the paraphilia. A masochist with this level of preference experiences most of their arousal through pain, and has difficulty without it. The person has a harder time not indulging in their preferences on a regular basis, even in a non-sexual way. All fantasies involve the paraphilia. The person may change their lifestyle to more closely fit their needs, and may act on their desires. 

A person with focused paraphilia is uncontrollably aroused by the subject of the paraphilia. Their entire thought process begins to focus on their desires. They are incapable of arousal except through the subject of their paraphilia. Interpersonal relationships that are not founded on their desires will also fail. The person will usually begin becoming anti-social or uncommunicative. Sexual addictions and obsessive compulsive disorders are common at this high level of paraphilia. 

A person with multiple focused paraphilias is usually incapable of functioning normally in society. In particular, persons who have the following combinations withdraw from society or are criminalized:

* sadistic/hybristophiliac (cause pain, commit crime)
* masochistic/blood fetishists
* masochistic with algolagnia

====7 Clinical Paraphilias====

{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:steelblue; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Application-x-executable.svg|right|20px]]'''DSM-IV on : Paraphilia Definition'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
The primary characteristic in this category is the impairment in normal sexual functioning due to uncommon distressing and repetitive sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors. This can result in an inability to perform or reach an orgasm in the absence of these factors, a strong repulsion of sexual activity outside of the factors that attract, or an exaggerated sexual response cycle or sexual interest.  A medical cause must be ruled out prior to making any sexual dysfunction diagnosis and the symptoms must be hindering the person's everyday functioning. The following seven paraphilias are set aside due to their unique and easily segregated effects

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

There are seven ''clinically recognized'' paraphilias. These are considered to be the most common paraphilias, and each one is distinct. DSM-IV is close to recatagorizing everything according to a new system, in which paraphilia would be broken down into three classes: action, reaction, and object based paraphilas. {{ref|dsm4}}

*Pedophilia: sexual arousal by and strong sexual attraction to children and adolescents. 
*Exhibitionism: sexual arousal by revealing one's body or performing sexual acts in public.
*Frotteurism: sexual arousal by rubbing one's body against an unwilling person. 
*Masochism: sexual arousal by having pain inflicted on one's self.
*Sadism: sexual arousal by inflicting pain on another.
*Transvestic Fetishism: sexual arousal by dressing and acting as the opposite sex.
*Voyeurism: sexual arousal by watching others engage in sex without their knowledge.

====Fetishism====

The DSM-IV is not precisely clear on fetishism. According to the DSM-IV, fetishism is the use of inanimate objects or parts of the human body as a stimulus to achieve sexual arousal and satisfaction. This means that some paraphilias are not clinical paraphilias but do not qualify as fetishes either, particularly &quot;action&quot; based paraphilias like biastophilia or lust murder. 

For the purposes of this book, fetishism will include the so-called &quot;Other paraphilias not otherwise specified&quot;, code 302.81. 

{| style=&quot;border:0; margin: 0;&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;10&quot;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; style=&quot;padding:0px; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; margin-bottom:15px;&quot; |&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:105%; line-height:120%; padding:0.4em; background-color:#eeeeee; border-bottom:1px solid #aaaaaa;&quot;&gt;
[[File:Exquisite-khelpcenter.png|right|20px]]'''Working Definition of Fetishism'''
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;background:#ffffff; padding:0.2em 0.4em 0.2em 0.4em; font-size:95%;&quot;&gt;
Fetishism the use of inanimate objects,actions with living or non-human beings, actions taken, or parts of the human body as a stimulus to achieve sexual arousal and satisfaction.

&lt;/div&gt;
|}

=== Cultural Meaning ===

The word paraphilia, or fetish, is a loaded term in society. Most people fail to understand the differing criteria used to identify ''real'' paraphilias from &quot;things that turn people on&quot;. For example, a male who is aroused by a woman's breasts does not have a breast fetish in the clinical sense of the word. The breast fetishist would be aroused by any breasts, and would have extreme difficulty in achieving arousal or orgasm without such stimulus.

'''Homosexuality and Bisexuality''' are important since in older version of the DSM they were considered mental illnesses or paraphilias. Some misinformed people today still term them as such. They are '''not''' paraphilias since they encompass a far larger perversion of the normal sexual instinct than what arouses. The term '''perversion''' is used non-judgmentally, to indicate deviations from the scientific norm of expected behavior. Unfortunately, this sort of language does not serve to segregate these actions from the stigma of being &quot;unnatural&quot; to most heterosexuals.

'''Transgender''' individuals do not have a fetish, either. Transvestic Fetishism is arousal by dressing up as or pretending to be a member of the opposite sex. A transgender or transsexual person is someone who undergoes surgical, hormonal, and psychological procedures to shift their sex to the opposite sex. Transgenderation is '''not''' a paraphilia. Culturally, of course, it's deemed non-standard and again, older versions of the DSM lumped it in with Transvestic Fetishism. 

'''Pedophilia''' is perhaps the most problematic large-scale paraphilia and, since it involves children, the most reviled. Some versions of the DSM-IV would lump pedophilia in with the more arcane term of chronoastiphilia, or attraction to younger people. But pedophilia is specific. Throughout history, younger individuals have engaged in sexual congress with older members of the community through marriage, etc. A 25 year old male engaging in sexual contact with a 15 year old female is not pedophilia. Pedophilia specifically refers to children (under 13 years of age) who are typically not sexually or mentally mature enough to have a developed sex drive or physically developed enough to safely engage in sex. Due to the large number of molestation cases from parents, priests, etc., this paraphilia has been shoved to the forefront of the cultural limelight.

'''Other paraphilias and fetishes''', such as zoosadism, necrophilia, and crush fetishes, are so limited in their exposure that the mere existence of such things often shocks people who were unaware of them. Typically speaking, the more extreme the paraphilia, the less known it tends to be. Unfortunately, the most dangerous and criminal paraphilias are almost unknown outside of certain circles.

=== Sexuality and Paraphilia ===

Obviously, since paraphilia is a sexual disorder, it should come as no surprise that any discussion of it is tied up heavily with a discourse on sexuality itself. Paraphilia is , in the simplest terms, an attraction to things beyond the norm. 

====Interactions====
One large issue with sexuality and paraphilia is that they are not always mutual in nature or at their core. Thankfully, many paraphilias go extremely well together. A masochistic raptophiliac who has algolagnia (a person who enjoys pain, enjoys being raped, and derives sexual pleasure from physical pain beyond their control) is a natural match for a sadistic biastophiliac (person who enjoys raping and causing pain). With the popularity and anonymity the internet affords, more and more people are finding others who match their sexual fetish.

There are dangers in paraphilia relationships, however. Do to the violent nature of many paraphilias', one partner may end up injured in a way neither intended, or possibly dead. This is why many paraphilia websites and groups stress the importance of education and offer events where newcomers may learn about various fetishes and how to safely execute them. Safe words and other tools are used to make sure consent is always given, though some members of paraphilia groups have reported and written articles where they claim to feel ashamed if they use their safe word. Another danger to a paraphilia relationship is mental. Some paraphilia fetishes involve emotional and/or mental derogation. A person may find that they enjoy this in fantasy, but it is damaging to them in reality. Partners in such a relationship should keep an eye out for indications of this, as the person being derogated may not realize how it is affecting them. There are sex-positive therapists who will deal with those kinds of situations, allowing the person to not feel ashamed for their needs while at the same time exploring their boundaries so that they know what is too much for them. 

While many paraphilia's are harmless when explored by someone who has educated themselves on their fetish and it's safety, some cannot be achieved without breaking some moral or legal law. This can lead to sexual frustration, a feeling of being abnormal and &quot;wrong&quot;, and cause emotional problems that could potentially lead to violent behavior. This is especially true of those who fetishize life threatening injuries or death. There is a major debate on whether it is better to allow porn or computer generated fake porn of various paraphilias in the theory that they would calm sexual frustration and decrease violent acts, or if it is better to disdain or even make certain paraphilia porn illegal on the theory that extreme porn promotes extreme or violent behavior. Neither side has made any headway in the debate, though both sides have scientific studies they claim are unbiased and prove their argument. 

There are different levels of extreme in any paraphilia relationship, and though one couple may have the same fetish as another they may go to completely different extremes or satisfy their urges in completely different ways.

====Criminal concerns====
Other paraphilias are so outre and unacceptable, such as pedophilia, that there is no legal way for a person suffering from them to pursue them. A person with focused pedophilia '''will''' end up having sex with young children until he or she is caught and imprisoned. 

Some paraphilias, such as pyrophilia, can cause property damage. Others, like necrophilia, can wreak enormous psychological damage on a grieving person, who now has to deal with the fact that a loved one's corpse has been sexually violated. People who are aroused by the torture and slaying of pets is also a criminally problematic issue. 

The law, as a rule, does not accept paraphilia as a debilitating mental illness that may impact the ability of a person to tell right from wrong. The fact that it is increasingly compulsive is also not seen as a legal basis for consideration on the legislation. Particularly, in the case of pedophilia, where premeditation and clear intent are required, the law is unprepared to alter it's viewpoint, that paraphilia should be considered a valid mental illness and paraphilic patients should be given proper treatment. It also interesting to note that police forces take in consideration this factors when dealing with the issue in the investigative process, monitoring of detected &quot;deviants&quot;. Facts that are also taken in consideration when attempting rehabilitation of individuals convicted of paraphilia related crimes. 

{{TODO|Mention the treatment of the impulses, for example with chemical castration. I also do not agree that paraphilia as described is so compulsive that an individual may not fight the urges to act. It may depend on the individual determination and availability of opportunity and ease of acting upon said urges. It also seems that as all compulsions the more one acts on them the more one craves repetition.}}  

====Mental health issues====
Aside from mental health issues caused by negligence in supervising someone's mental health in a relationship, or identity crisis and shame caused by a paraphilia being illegal, a person can have mental health issues that stem from the paraphilia itself. This is especially true of specific paraphilias. An example of this would be a masochist finding release easily with a sadist, compared to a masochist who wants bones broken regularly (a specific rather than generalized paraphelia). A person cannot survive having their bones broken too often in too soon a space of time. They would be considered someone who, if unable to control their urges, would be advised to seek a mental health professional.

When these urges cannot be satisfied, undue stress is often placed on the mind of the sufferer. Common effects of this sort of psychic stress can cause further psychological problems, including obsessive-compulsive disorders, sexual addictions, and depression.{{ref|para243}}</text>

There are distinct classifications of paraphilias, which can be sorted in terms of their application. Any such disorder, to be clincally recognized, must be characterized by a 6-month period of recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies or sexual urges involving a specific act, depending on the paraphilia.Obtain a complete history and perform complete mental status, physical, and neurological examinations to assist with the evaluation and to rule out other disease processes.Rule out major medical or psychiatric illnesses. Look for both hard and soft neurological signs involving the striato-thalamo-cortical processing loop (theory).

&lt;/div&gt;

The definition and clinical diagnosis demanded by the DSM-IV for a &quot;mainline&quot; paraphilia is rather restrictive. The previous section covered an overview of paraphilia. This section will detail each component.

==The Seven Classic types==

The DSM-IV recognized seven types of paraphilia as clinical in nature, and threw all the rest into a single code under the heading &quot;Paraphilias not otherwise classified&quot;. The reason these seven are clinical is due to several reasons.{{ref|dsm4}}

The first reason is that it is believed, to a large extent, that all humans have at least limited paraphiliac tendencies in these seven categories. While this may sound somewhat disturbing, the theory goes that these things are seen as deviant due to the fact that normal people can control these minor urges. In everyday life, people have minor urges towards voyeurism, masochism, exhibitionism, and certainly frotteurism. Many people have sadistic or pedophiliac arousal and feel disgusted over such. These things are suppressed in almost all people, as multiple tests have shown.{{ref|psy2}}

The second reason these are &quot;clinical&quot; paraphilias is that they occur in a large enough segment of the population to have been tested and examined under clinical conditions. Literally '''any''' action or interaction ''could'' be the basis for a paraphilia, including such outlandish thing as ghosts, food, or even tinsel. (These, amusingly, have all been reported){{ref|psy}} The seven clinical types have clear definitions for diagnosis and clear-cut legal, culture, and moral issues of concern to both psychiatrists and the public at large.

Dr. John Wincze, a abnormal psychology researcher and expert on paraphilia, wrote a long paper on why the clinical paraphilia's were so important, and why so little attention was paid to other paraphilia types:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary consideration in determining the clinical significance of a paraphilial sexual disorder is proportional to the effects such disorders have on society as a whole. The more inherently dangerous paraphilia, such as lust murder syndrome and rape fixation, are so intertwined with the crimes necessary that studying them is a matter for criminal rather than sexual psychology. On the other hand, the actions of the unclassified paraphilias are, in light of their actual focus, quite harmless. One rarely hears about someone who enjoys the feel of silk becoming an issue of law. However, the clinical paraphilias are both widely spread and disturbing in nature. Many of them involve or could involve involuntary participation. All of them involve, with the lamentable and archaic exception of tranvestic fetishism, issues of criminality and mental stability.{{ref|psy3}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

===Voyeurism===

Voyeurism is an uncontrollable attraction to, and arousal from, the act of observing unsuspecting individuals, usually strangers, who may be naked or in the process of disrobing, engaging in sexual activity, or otherwise naked. The voyeur is different than a person who simply enjoys nakedness or watching people have sex, since the arousal comes from the fact the other person is unaware they are being watched. Related behaviors often include various antisocial disorders. 

The DSM-IV lists the main criteria for the diagnosis as being:

*Having intense sexual desires, fantasies or behaviors concerning the act of watching an unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing or having sex for a long period of time.
*Voyeuristic activity is the primary mode of sexual arousal and expression. The subject is increasingly incapable of sexuality without this activity.
*Voyeuristic activity causes clinically important distress or impairs work, social or personal functioning. 

Onset is typically before the age of fifteen, and in 60% of cases studied, the individual may become so invested in the voyeuristic activity as to have this as the sole sexual behavior. This often is a chronic condition.

Levels:
*''Standard'' : A standard voyeur will regularly engage in acts of voyeurism, and will attempt to incorporate voyeuristic themes into any sexual acts with others (watching their sexual partner engage in sex with a third person, for example). 
*''Preferred'' : A preferred voyeur will have increasing difficulty in maintaining personal sexual relationships, instead trying to find ways to view unaware persons in the act of disrobing or having sex. 
*''Focused'' : A focused voyeur will be unable to resist their tendencies. They will almost never actually have direct sexual contact with other persons, and will usually purchase equipment to enhance their voyeuristic tendencies. Some may go so far as to commit breaking and entering to observe directly.

Many people have some voyeuristic tendencies, usually below the clinical threshold. The primary clinical factor is the requirement that the subject be unaware. A voyeur would not, for example, be interested in going to a strip club.

===Exhibitionism===

===Sadism===
===Masochism===
===Paedophilia===

This disorder is characterized by either intense sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a pre-adolescent child , usually 13 or younger. To be considered for this diagnosis according to DSM-IV, the person must be at least 16 years old and at least 5 years older than the child.

Levels:
*''Standard'' : A standard paedophiliac will almost certainly not engage in actual intercourse with children. They will almost certainly use paedophilaic imagery, and may commit acts of voyerism against children. Some will use ageplay, or seek to have sex with young-looking adults. 
*''Preferred'' : A preferred paedophliac will try to commit at least peripheral contact with children in a sexual manner. They will certainly use paedophilaic imagery. Some, if they have children, will seek to molest them. 
*''Focused'' : A focused paedophiliac will be unable to resist attempting to prey on children, and may resort to criminal acts to meet his needs. If they have children, they will almost certainly be molested repeatedly.

Paedophilia's is one of the most common forms of paraphilia. {{ref|pedo2}}.

===Frotteurism===
===Transvestic===
==Fetishes==

As stated in the church's eighth article of faith, &quot;We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.&quot;

The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter Day Saints uses the Book of Mormon, King James Version of the Bible, Pearl of Great Price, and the Doctrine and Covenants as official church scripture.  The Church also believes that the inspired word of its leaders, namely Prophets and Apostles are scriptural in nature - &quot;And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.&quot; [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/68 D&amp;C68:4]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sunburn is from over-exposure to the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. While the symptoms are usually temporary (such as red skin that is painful to the touch), the skin damage is often permanent and can have serious long-term health effects, including skin cancer.    
* There is no such thing as a &quot;healthy tan.&quot; Unprotected sun exposure causes premature aging of the skin.
* Sun exposure can cause first and second degree burns.
* Skin cancer usually appears in adulthood, but is caused by sun exposure and sunburns that began as early as childhood. You can help prevent skin cancer by protecting your skin and your children's skin from the harmful rays of the sun.

'''Factors that make sunburn more likely:'''
* Infants and children are especially sensitive to the burning effects of the sun.
* People with fair skin are more likely to get sunburn. But even dark and black skin can burn and should be protected.
* The sun's rays are strongest during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The sun's rays are also stronger at higher altitudes and lower latitudes (closer to the tropics). Reflection off water, sand, or snow can intensify the sun's burning rays.
* Sun lamps can cause severe sunburn.
* Some medications (such as the antibiotic doxycycline) can make you more susceptible to sunburn.
'''First Aid'''
* Try taking a cool bath or shower. Or place wet, cold wash cloths on the burn for 10 to 15 minutes, several times a day. You can mix baking soda in the water to help relieve the pain. (Small children may become easily chilled, so keep the water tepid.)
* Apply a soothing lotion to the skin.
* Aloe gel is a common household remedy for sunburns. Aloe contains active compounds that help stop pain and inflammation of the skin.
* An over-the-counter pain medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be helpful. DO NOT give aspirin to children.

'''Do Not'''
* DO NOT apply petroleum jelly, benzocaine, lidocaine, or butter to the sunburn. They make the symptoms worse and can prevent healing.
* DO NOT wash burned skin with harsh soap.

== Overview ==

'''''Witherwings''''' is an alias for [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] pet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Hippogriff|Hippogriff]].

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] dies at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], he leaves behind several survivors, notably the house-elf [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kreacher|Kreacher]] and his pet Hippogriff, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Buckbeak|Buckbeak]]. While Kreacher was taking care of himself for several years while Sirius was incarcerated, and so is not much of a concern, Buckbeak has no such resources and must be cared for by someone... and who better than [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Rubeus Hagrid]], who had been caring for him originally? Of course, Buckbeak was supposed to be executed, so he cannot return under that name; Hagrid renames him to keep the Ministry from trying again.

While he is referred to as Witherwings a few times in the book, the deception is very thin; people don't seem to be able to remember that he is not Buckbeak. Thus, all the events that occur to Witherwings are cataloged under the character entry for Buckbeak.

== Strengths ==

== Weaknesses ==

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Witherwings is treated as a pet by Hagrid, sharing his hut much the way that Fang, Hagrid's boarhound, does.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Blister Prevention'''

When it comes to blisters on the feet, it is always best to avoid them.  Blisters are caused when your foot rubs against something repeatedly.  Blisters can be avoided by wearing footwear that fits you correctly.  Also, be sure to break your footwear in before embarking on a long hike.  It also helps to wear two pairs of socks.  When you do this, the inner sock moves with your foot and the outer sock moves with your boot.  All the rubbing takes place between the two socks rather than between your foot and the sock.  This will eventually wear a hole in your sock, but replacing socks is a lot less painful than hiking with a blister.

'''Blister Treatment'''

Try not to break the blister open.  It is far better if the skin continues to cover the injury, as this will keep out germs and prevent infection.  If you must open the blister in order to be able to walk, do it as follows.
*Clean the affected area
*Sterilize a needle
*Pierce the blister in several places around its perimeter to drain the fluid, but try to leave as much of the skin intact as possible.
*Wipe the injury down with rubbing alcohol.
*Cover a small blister with an adhesive bandage
*Cover a large blister with gauze and adhesive tape.
*Be sure to allow the blister to breathe

      <text xml:space="preserve">Besides the obvious expansion of lessons, there are many ways for you to contribute, even as a beginning student of Cantonese. Some are listed below. Add your thoughts as to what you think should be done to the [[Cantonese/Planning|Planning]] page so that discussion is not lost, scattered throughout various discussion pages.
=Other Ways to Contribute =
==Stroke Order Images==
[[Image:不-red.png|right|thumb|90px|Black to red fade]]
[[Image:永-order.gif|left|thumb|100px|Gif animations]]
There is [[commons:Category:Chinese_stroke_order|a project on Wikicommons]] to upload images and animations of the stroke order for characters. There are [[commons:Chinese stroke order:Protocols|directions on how to contribute]]. It's easy with the use of some free programs and can be done even with only a basic understanding of stroke order. Please contribute so that we'll have a standardized reference for this and other Wikibook users.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;
==Sound Samples==
[[Image:Gnome-speakernotes.png|right]]
With a microphone and a read through the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia/Recording_guidelines recording guidelines] for the Spoken Wikipedia you can contribute audio examples. Sound samples are particularly important for beginners, especially ones who are studying alone with no teacher or native speaker on hand. 

You can see what has been uploaded so far at [[commons:Category:Chinese pronunciation|Category:Chinese pronunciation]].

==Internationalisation==
[[Image:Domenico Ghirlandaio - St Jerome in his study.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Saint Jerome, the patron saint of translators.]]
===Translate Pages===
Currently, the English version is the most developed of the Cantonese Wikibooks. If you know another language, please check if a Chinese book is started in that language and compare it to this one. You can make changes to their content based on ideas gained here, or do a wholesale translation of this textbook into the target language. Since the Cantonese parts can stay the same across languages, a lot of lesson development work can be saved in this way.

If you can only do a partial translation, leave a note to later contributors linking back to your source (a good candidate for using [[Help:Templates|Templates]]).

===Add InterWiki Links===
If you can't translate pages, but know enough of a language to locate the corresponding Cantonese Wikibook, you can make Interwiki links. You can see them on the Wikibooks Sidebar listed under &quot;in other languages&quot; when available. They are typically placed at the very end of a page using a simple format. Here is the list used for the Cantonese TOC page:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[de:Kantonesisch]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

In addition to the main page, Lesson pages, Stroke Order pages and anything else can be interwikied as long as the content is the same.

&lt;center&gt;'''Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1'''&lt;/center&gt;

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse than the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tax is charged by reference to accounting periods&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Often an accounting period coincides with a companies period of account. This is the period for which it draws up accounts&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 832 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 832(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;, except for a life assurance company, where it is the period for which it draws up its periodical return&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 431 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 431 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, periods of account and accounting periods do not necessarily coincide.

==Basic rules==

An accounting period begins when&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

*the company comes within the charge to corporation tax;
*an accounting period of the company ends, and the company is still within the charge to corporation tax; or
*the company does not currently have an accounting period and has a chargeable gain or allowable loss&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(6) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

An accounting period ends on the earliest of the following&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(3) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;:

*the expiration of 12 months from the beginning of the accounting period;
*an accounting date of the company or, if there is a period for which the company does not draw up accounts, the end of that period;
*the company beginning or ceasing to trade or to be, in respect of the trade or (if more than one) of all trades carried on by it, within the charge to corporation tax;
*the company beginning or ceasing to be UK resident;
*the company ceasing to be within the charge to corporation tax.

There are further rules to deal with windings up, life assurance companies and lessor companies.

A UK-resident company is treated as coming within the charge to corporation tax (if it has not already come within the charge to corporation tax) when it commences to carry on business&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(4) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Example==

Suppose ABC Ltd, a UK resident company is incorporated on 1 August 20X1. It acquires a source of income (an interest-bearing bank account) on 1 September 20X1 and commences trading on 1 October 20X1 and continues trading throughout all other periods under review. It draws up its accounts for the following periods:

:1 August 20X1 to 31 December 20X1
:1 January 20X2 to 31 December 20X2
:1 January 20X3 to 30 June 20X3
:1 July 20X3 to 31 December 20X4

Then ABC Ltd would have the following accounting periods:

:1 September 20X1 to 30 September 20X1 (from when it came into charge to corporation tax to the commencement of trade)
:1 October 20X1 to 31 December 20X1 (to the end of a period of account)
:1 January 20X2 to 31 December 20X2 (to the end of a period of account)
:1 January 20X3 to 30 June 20X3 (to the end of a period of account)
:1 July 20X3 to 30 June 20X4 (to the expiry of 12 months)
:1 July 20X4 to 31 December 20X4 (to the end of a period of account)

==Company with more than one trade==

If a company carrying on more than one trade draws up accounts of any of them to different dates, and does not make up general accounts for the whole of the company's activities, the company may determine that any one of those dates shall be taken into consideration for the purposes of determining whether an accounting period has ended under the rule in the second bullet point above&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(5) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

If, however, the Board of HMRC is of the opinion, on reasonable grounds, that the date so chosen by the company is inappropriate, they may, if it is reasonable to do so, give notice that the accounting date of another of the company's trades should be used instead&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(5A) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Mean accounting date==

Some companies draw up financial statements to the same day of the week, a Sunday, say, each year. They will therefore have 364 day (52 week) or 371 day (53 week) periods of account. As long as the company draws its accounts up to within four days of a mean accounting date each year, it may, for the purposes of determining its accounting periods, deem its accounts to be drawn up for a twelve month period. For example, when there is a 371 day period of account, instead of having one accounting period of 365 days (in a non-leap year) and another of 6 days, it will prepare its return on the assumption that the period of account was 365 days long.&lt;ref&gt;ICEAW Technical Release 500&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspector determining the accounting period==

Where it appears to the tax inspector that the beginning or end of any accounting period is uncertain, he may make an assessment on the company for such period, not exceeding 12 months, as appears to him appropriate. In that event, that period is treated for all purposes as an accounting period unless the inspector sees fit to revise it as a result of receiving further facts, or on an appeal against the assessment in respect of some other matter the company shows the true accounting periods. If on an appeal against an assessment made under this rule the company shows the true accounting periods, the assessment appealed against has effect as an assessment or assessments for the true accounting periods, and assessments may be made for any such periods as might have been made at the time when the assessment appealed against was made.  &lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(8) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and winding up==

===Administration===

An accounting period ends immediately before the day a company enters into administration. For this purpose a company enters administration when it enters administration under Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 or is subject to any corresponding procedure otherwise than under that Act (for example, in an overseas jurisdiction). &lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(7ZA) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

An accounting period ends when a company ceases to be in administration&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(3)(da) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;. For these purposes a company ceases to be in administration when it ceases to be in administration under Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 or any corresponding event occurs otherwise than under that Act&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(5B) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; (for example, in an overseas jurisdiction).

===Winding up===

An accounting period ends and a new one begins with the commencement of a winding up. For this purpose a winding up is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the winding up of the company, or on the presentation of a winding up petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and a winding up order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose in the case of a winding up otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986. &lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(7) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, an accounting period does not end other than by the expiration of 12 months from its beginning or by the completion of the winding up&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(7) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, if the company later enters administration, this rule is disapplied from that point (and with an accounting period ending because the company has entered into administration)&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(7ZA) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the course of a winding up, a company may make an estimate of when it will be wound up so that it can prepare tax returns for its final accounting period before that period ends. If the date assumed for the winding up turns out to be before the actual winding up, then an accounting period ends on the date assumed for the winding up, a new accounting period starts, and the immediately preceding paragraph applies as if the winding up had started with that accounting period.  &lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 342 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 342(6) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Cooperatives preparing quarterly and half-yearly accounts==

HMRC will, under certain conditions, allow cooperatives that prepare quarterly and half-yearly accounts to merge a number of periods of account for tax purposes so that they have only accounting date each year&lt;ref&gt;Extra-statutory concession C12&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Life assurance companies==

Additionally, there are special rules that apply to life assurance companies from which life assurance business is transferred under and insurance business transfer scheme. Different rules apply depending on whether [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 444AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|s444AA ICTA]] applies. For transfers before 1 January 2007, s444AA applies where the whole of the transferor's long-term insurance business is being transferred and the company. It is proposed that the Finance Bill 2007 will amend this for transfers on or after 1 January, so that s444AA applies where the whole or substantially the whole of the transferor's long-term insurance business is transferred, in which case the transfer time is taken to be the time some business is first transferred&lt;ref&gt;See draft legislation released by HMRC on 6 December 2006[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pbr2006/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;.

If s444AA does not apply, an accounting period of the transferor company ends with the day of the transfer&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(7A) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

If s444AA applies, an accounting period of the transferor company ends immediately before the transfer, and the transferor also has an accounting period covering the instant of the transfer (except for the purposes of calculating the equalisation provision for tax purposes)&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 12 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 12(7C) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Example where s444AA applies===

Suppose a transferor company, XYZ Life Ltd, has in the past prepared periodical returns for a period encompassing the calendar year. It transfers the whole of its business at 11.59pm on 31 December 20X1, after which it retains some cash on deposit. It agrees with the Financial Services Authority that it does not need to prepare a periodical return for 20X1.

XYZ Life Ltd will have the following accounting periods in 20X1:

:1 January 20X1 to immediately before the transfer of business
:An accounting period covering the instant of the transfer (11.59pm on 31 December 20X1)
:An accounting period covering the period beginning immediately after the transfer to midnight on 31 December 20X1

==Lessor companies==

If a company carries on a business of leasing plant or machinery, is within the charge to corporation tax in respect of the business and there is a qualifying change of ownership in relation to the company, then an accounting period of the company ends on the day of that qualifying change in ownership, and a new accounting period begins on the following day. There are exceptions to this in Paragraph 40.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2006|Paragraphs 3, 33, 40 Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial deeming provisions==

Other provisions in the Taxes Acts sometimes deem there to be accounting periods for specific purposes only. This is typically on the introduction of new legislation. For example, when section 75 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 was replaced as a result of the Finance Act 2004, companies, if necessary, deemed themselves to have an accounting period ending on 31 March 2004 for the purposes of calculating management expenses that they were entitled to under the rules applying pre-1 April 2004 and post-31 March 2004.

'''Introduction to Game Theory'''

Game theory, according to Wikipedia, is a branch of applied mathematics that uses models to study interactions with formalised incentive structures. These interactions are called &quot;games&quot;. Game theory can be used to explain phenomena in the areas of economics, political theory, evolutionary science and military strategy, to name a few. There are several ingredients which are common to all games.

'''Players/Agents'''

The first thing we need are two or more players. These can also be called agents. These, like in a board game or sport, are the people, group, animal etc. who actually interact. These players have preferences and goals. That is to say, like all normal people, these agents prefer some options over another. Peaches over apples, happiness over unhappiness - it doesn't really matter WHAT they prefer, but they must have preferences. These preferences are used to work out exactly what the outcomes of a game will be, because usually, players will choose options that increase the chances of getting their preferred outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Learn how to perform and practice (properly) single and double strokes.

== Single strokes and double strokes ==
=== Single Strokes ===
A technique mainly used in fills, this comprises of you hitting drums with your alternate hands. Oh, I'll just put tab...

 CR|----------------|
 HH|----------------|
 T1|--RLRL----------|
 Sn|RL----RLRL------|
 T2|----------RL----|
 T3|------------RL--|
 BD|----------------|

This is a simple fill, using single strokes. If you remember, in our description of tab L means hit it with your left stick and R means hit it with your right stick.

=== Double strokes ===
The same, but two hits with each hand! Ok then, more tab...

 CR|----------------|
 HH|----------------|
 T1|----------------|
 Sn|LLRRLLRRLLRRLL--|
 T2|----------------|
 T3|----------------|
 BD|----------------|

I use this technique for convienience and if I find it impractical in one instance to hit a certain drum.
You'll see what we mean...

== Practicing strokes ==
When you first start drumming, your strokes might be fast, but they are nothing compared to your potential maximum. To achieve your potential maximum all you need to do is practice the stroke techniques once a day for a long as you want (longer = faster strokes!). You'll need to practice properly, too. 

Step-by-step guide to practicing strokes:
# Starting with the single stroke, start very slow and build up speed. &lt;br /&gt;
# When you begin to feel tension in your arms, slow down back to your original speed. &lt;br /&gt;
# Repeat with double stroke. 

If you continue playing either of the strokes after beginning to feel tension, you could cause some serious damage - repetetive strain injury could force you to abandon your drumming career, besides being a nuisance, sometimes making everyday tasks unbearably painful. 

Want to see the coolness of playing with single and double strokes? Then play this...

 CR|----------------|
 HH|----------------|
 T1|--RLRL----------|
 Sn|LL----RLRL------|
 T2|----------RL----|
 T3|------------RL--|
 BD|----------------| 

(Ok, that doesn't really prove my point so anyone who can think up a better fill as this example, feel free to put it in).

The '''common chickweed''' (''Stellaria media'') is a cool-season annual plant native to Europe. The plant germinates in fall or late winter, then forms large mats of foliage. Flowers are small and white, followed quickly by the seed pods. This plant flowers and sets seed at the same time, and the seed pods explode when mature to disperse the seeds.

==Description==
Common chickweed is a low, mat-forming plant, present throughout the cool seasons and winter, but dying during hot weather. The roots are very fine, and the crown easily breaks away if pulled from very dry or frozen soils, allowing the plant to regrow.

==Ecology==
In both Europe and North America this plant is an invasive weed of gardens, fields, and disturbed grounds. Control is difficult due to the heavy seed sets.

==Uses==
The plant has uses in folk medicine; 17th century herbalist John Gerard recommended it as a remedy for mange. It can also be tolerated as a winter soil cover.

==Control==
{{weedcontrol|

* ''Look of &amp;perp;'' in a mathematical context, &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; is preferred, whereas in a code context, &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; should be the way to go.
* ''Draw real pictures'' showing the various poset structures. Especially the ones with the recursive data type definitions!
* It's very cool that semantics can partly be explored in Haskell itself. Are there paragraphs where this opportunity was forgotten?

* ''Improve examples and exercises.'' Most have been invented very quickly and are not very good. Those that are, are most likely ones that I remembered from different textbooks. Exercises where one must repeat or slightly modify the explanation from the text are helpful for a first understanding but should be held in low quantities. True insight can be only be achieved by tasks where one has to twist one's mind. Train your brain, don't train a pattern.
* ''Add more exercises and examples?'' A spot where readers frequently get stuck is clearly a good place for additional examples and exercises. Hopefully, these will emerge at this Talk-page.

== Denotational semantics ==

Imperative languages can certainly be given denotational semantics.  It's just that a direct semantics doesn't work anymore.  You need to model the store, and usually continuations as well.

: Furthermore imperative languages can be given other non-operational semantics such as Floyd-Hoare-Dijkstra style axiomatic semantics. You (Apfelmus) may be interested to search the EWD archive for what Dijkstra had to say about operational reasoning, most of it in regard to imperative programming. It was I who removed the erroneous and misleading paragraph mentioning imperative languages. I apologise for not adding an edit summary this was due to my stupidity not rudeness.

:: Of course, you are right. Indeed, just by using a MonadState, one already gives denotational semantics to imperative stuff. I somehow wanted to pin down that reasoning is much easier in purely functional languages because the semantics are very direct. So I just denied denotational semantics for imperative stuff altogether and hoped nobody would complain :) Compared to pure functional programs, it doesn't matter much whether I have operational (&quot;machine, change your state!&quot;) or denotational (&quot;plan of how machine state changes&quot;) semantics, the reasoning doesn't get much easier. Denotational semantics tries to recapture as much pure stuff as possible from the operational semantics, similar in power to the finding of a suitable loop invariant. Ah, and thanks for the EWD link.

== forall a . a ==

The type 'forall a . a' doesn't have to give an error.  It can also loop forever.  (Which is an error, but not observable.)

: Fixed, &quot;any function of the polymorphic type forall a . a must denote &amp;perp;&quot;. Why didn't I chose that compelling formulation in first place? [[User:Apfelmus|Apfelmus]] 21:04, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Mistake in the definition of &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt; ? ==

Isn't there a mistake in the definition, which states that &quot;&lt;math&gt;a \sqsubset b&lt;/math&gt; denotes that a is more defined than b&quot; ? It seems inconsistent with &quot;every concrete number is more defined than &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\perp\ \sqsubset 1\ ,\ \perp\ \sqsubset 2\ , \dots&lt;/math&gt;&quot;. Shouldn't it be &quot;less defined&quot; ?

:I was going to point this out too. How about &quot;&lt;math&gt;a \sqsubset b&lt;/math&gt; denotes that b is more defined than a&quot;? [[User:71.202.203.117|71.202.203.117]] 00:34, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

Oops, it's a mistake of course. Fixed. At the same time, I reverted &quot;completely equal programs&quot; to &quot;equal&quot;, because of the subtetly that programs can be ''syntactically'' equal as well. Of course, they can be syntactically different and still denote the same &quot;mathematical object&quot;. [[User:Apfelmus|Apfelmus]] 20:47, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

== Non-strict constructors ==
&quot;because we can write a function that tells them apart&quot;
 f (Just _) = 4
 f _        = 7
&quot;As &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; ignores the contents of the Just constructor, &lt;code&gt;f (Just _|_)&lt;/code&gt; is 4 but &lt;code&gt;f _|_&lt;/code&gt; is 7.&quot;
This argument is truly ingenious but unfortunately wrong :) With the above definition, we have &lt;code&gt; f &amp;perp; = &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt;. The stated properties cannot hold because they violate monotonicity. The fact that &lt;code&gt;Just &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; is different from &amp;perp; cannot be &quot;proved&quot;, it's a design decision. How can this be formulated nicely? The author above clearly wanted to appeal to a &quot;proof&quot; by example like in the case of &lt;code&gt;const 1&lt;/code&gt;.
[[User:Apfelmus|Apfelmus]] 13:38, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

What's currently in the article is clearly wrong, as you point out, but the fact that f _|_ = _|_ and f (Just _|_) = 4 should be enough to achieve the author's point, that _|_ and (Just _|_) are distinct. -Chinju

== Approximations of the Factorial Function ==

The sentence &quot;That is, it transforms less defined functions to more defined ones.&quot;
seems to mean that &lt;math&gt;x\sqsubseteq g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all x which isn't true.

:You're right.  I just put in a clarification that hopefully makes more sense.  [[User:Stereotype441|Stereotype441]] 15:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

== Denotional semantics &amp; Equational reasoning ==

I just found an interesting article [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/danielsson06fast.html Fast and loose reasoning is morally correct].  Basically it says that even though having Bottom results in inconsistent logic, with a few simple constraints equational proofs still work.  I wonder whether some of it can be useful here.  I'll be away the rest of the weekend but then will try to read the paper more carefully.  I also wonder if the subject of [[w:paraconsistent logic]] has any applicability here.  &lt;/clueless newbie&gt; [[User:64.160.39.153|64.160.39.153]] 05:28, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

:Hello, sorry for this late response. I planned a chapter [[Haskell/Equation reasoning]] that covers reasoning formally about Haskell programs. As you point out, it would be great to have a subsection based on the article you mentioned that shows how equational reasoning keeps working with &amp;perp; although it usually assumes that all programs terminate. Thanks for your suggestion :) I don't know enough about paraconsistent logic, but equational reasoning that ignores &amp;perp; is like calculating with infinitesimal numbers: done right, it works, done wrong, it doesn't :). Related to that, I'd like also to outsource the infinite lists from this chapter to a place where all forms of program proofs (equational, denotational semantics, coinduction) live together, maybe even as a separate chapter. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 12:10, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

== Continuity ==

The text says that for any type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, any monotone function &lt;code&gt;f :: a -&gt; Integer&lt;/code&gt; must be continuous. Why? I can only prove &lt;math&gt;\sup\{f(x_0), f(x_1), \ldots \} \sqsubseteq f(\sup\{x_0, x_1, \ldots \})&lt;/math&gt;. Why there is not a type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and a sequence of values  &lt;math&gt;x_0 \sqsubseteq x_1 \sqsubseteq \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; such that, say, &lt;math&gt;f(x_i) = \perp&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(\sup \{x_0, x_1, \ldots\}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;?

:In the light of your comment, the argument in the text indeed doesn't show anything.
:The fundamental question I wanted to answer is that although the choice allowing or disallowing continuity is an arbitrary choice, every programming language can only formulate continous function. What magic makes this possible? I think that one can of course prove for every given language (given by its programming constructs like &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;if .. then .. else&lt;/code&gt;, recursion and so on) that only continous functions can be written down. However, I feel that this is not the right way to prove it because this property is universal for all programming languages, hence there ought to be a proof working for all languages at the same time.
:If the type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has only chains with finitely many elements, continuity is granted for free. But for example, &lt;code&gt;Integer-&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; has infinite chains, one being
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;x_i = n\mapsto\mbox{ if } n \le i \mbox{ then } 0
\mbox{ else } \perp&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
:Of course, &lt;math&gt;x_i\sqsubset x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, imagine a non-continuous function &lt;code&gt;f :: (Integer-&gt;Integer) -&gt; Integer&lt;/code&gt; with the requirements
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(x_i)=\perp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(\sup \{x_0, x_1, \ldots\})=0&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
:Can this funtion be written down in Haskell? No, for it would have to test it's function argument at all possible value and check whether the outcome is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;. Clearly, this would take an infinite amount of time. What I had in mind when writing the text is that the transition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; must happen at some finite point in the chain, the decision whether it's &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; may not be postponed to infinity. This is due to the finite nature of computation. With this in mind, the current text argues that the image of any function has in essence only finite chains so that the decision about the result value can indeed be done after a finite number of steps.
:Of course, this whole argument isn't formally correct, but I think it hints on what's going on. I currently don't know a correct argument.
:Clearly, the text needs a rewrite, though I'm unsure on how to do that. -- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 11:31, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

I have an informal counterexample (maybe), but I haven't the knowledge to formalize it. It is  inspired by Fran (indeed, I found this book when trying to understand Fran semantics). Let us define

&lt;code&gt;data Time = Exact Float | Interval Float Float&lt;/code&gt;

A value &lt;code&gt;Exact t&lt;/code&gt; means &quot;time is &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and a value &lt;code&gt;Interval t1 t2&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t_1 \le t_2&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;time is in between &lt;code&gt;t1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;t2&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Thus, according to this meaning, we define &lt;code&gt;Interval t1 t2&lt;/code&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt; &lt;code&gt;Exact t&lt;/code&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;t \in [t_1,t_2]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Interval t1 t2&lt;/code&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt; &lt;code&gt;Interval s1 s2&lt;/code&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;[s_1,s_2] \subset [t_1,t_2]&lt;/math&gt;. Now consider the sequence &lt;code&gt;xn = Interval 0 (1/n)&lt;/code&gt;, which converges to &lt;code&gt;Exact 0&lt;/code&gt;, and consider the function &lt;code&gt;f = g . len&lt;/code&gt; where

&lt;code&gt;len Interval t1 t2 = t2 - t1&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;len Exact t        = 0&lt;/code&gt;

and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is any function such that &lt;code&gt;g 0 = 0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g x = &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;. This is only an informal example, I don't know if it is valid.

:I don't think it's a counterexample because the meaning of &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt; is fixed as &quot;less defined than&quot;. I mean, neither &lt;code&gt;Interval t1 t2&lt;/code&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt; &lt;code&gt;Exact t&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;Interval t1 t2&lt;/code&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sqsupset&lt;/math&gt; &lt;code&gt;Exact t&lt;/code&gt; hold. In other words, &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt; is quite different. Your example basically tries to introduce the real numbers into denotational semantics by redefining &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, not all functions on real numbers are continuous anymore. (In fact, they all ''are'' continuous again in intuitionistic logic but that leads too far here)
:Also note that &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt; is a bad choice, because there is a smallest nonzero floating point number, i.e. the sequence &lt;code&gt;xn&lt;/code&gt; doesn't converge to &lt;code&gt;Exact 0&lt;/code&gt;. But you can use an exact representation of rational numbers instead to make at least this convergence work.

== Not all Functions in Strict Languages are Strict ==
I think this section is wrong. The reason that the lifting trick works is not because functions are not strict in function types, but because lambda terms like &lt;code&gt;(\x:Int.1)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;(\x:Int._|_)&lt;/code&gt; are in normal form and so cannot take a step of evalution. Other terms of type &lt;code&gt;Int-&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, like &lt;code&gt;(\x:Int-&gt;Int.x)(\x:Int.x)&lt;/code&gt; will be reduced.

In fact (ignoring type classes), evaluation in a Haskell-like language ought to be completely independent of type information, which can be erased and forgotten once type checking is completed. In a strict language, if &lt;code&gt;const1 (undefined :: Int) = _|_&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;const1 (undefined :: Int-&gt;Int) = _|_&lt;/code&gt;.

The following Standard ML code supports this:

&lt;code&gt;
exception Undefined

fun const1 (x:int-&gt;int) = 1

const1 (raise Undefined)
&lt;/code&gt;

In the above code, &lt;code&gt;const1&lt;/code&gt; has type &lt;code&gt;(int-&gt;int)-&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;raise Undefined&lt;/code&gt;, which has equivalent behaviour to Haskell's &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;, has type &lt;code&gt;int-&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.

The line &lt;code&gt;const1 (raise Undefined)&lt;/code&gt; gives an exception (bottom), not 1.

A strict language shown in chapter 14 of TAPL has an 'error' term, very similar to Haskell's 'undefined'. It also has this behaviour.

[[User:Rebooted|Rebooted]] 15:32, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

:Good point. The problem is that ML has &quot;two&quot; undefined functions, namely
: &lt;code&gt;raise Undefined :: Int -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt;
: and
: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lambda;x.raise Undefined :: Int -&gt; Int&lt;/code&gt;
: or better
: &lt;code&gt; fix (&amp;lambda;f x.f x) :: Int -&gt; Int &lt;/code&gt;
: In other words, we can distinguish between a function that is an exception and a function that raises an exception on every value. Put differently, the function type is lifted by an additional &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp; ~= raise Undefined&lt;/code&gt; and every function is indeed strict with respect to this &amp;perp;. Unfortunately, this &amp;perp; is useless for fixpoint iteration which depends on &lt;code&gt;&amp;perp; = &amp;lambda;x.&amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; (as defined in the beginning of the chapter).
:So, yes, the section is not correct but the denotational semantics of call-by-value are even trickier than the section is wrong :-) I'm unsure what to do. I wanted the section to somehow show the &lt;code&gt;() -&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; trick which can simulate call-by-name in a call-by-value language. Hm, maybe it doesn't belong to denotational semantics at all?
:-- [[User:Apfelmus|apfe&lt;b&gt;&amp;lambda;&lt;/b&gt;mus]] 16:59, 6 September 2007 (UTC)

::I'd recommend removing the section and replacing it with one entitled &quot;Emulating non-strict behavior in strict languages&quot; which just demonstrates the trick.
::[[User:Rebooted|Rebooted]] 15:31, 9 September 2007 (UTC)

:::On second thought, I'm not sure whether this solves the problem because the issue is even larger now: the discussion of &quot;strict language&quot; is wrong, too. I mean, the whole chapter implicitly assumes that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lambda;x.&amp;perp;=&amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; which doesn't work for call-by-value. Also, the trick works still thanks to some kind of non-strictness, namely the fact that &lt;code&gt;f (&amp;lambda;x.&amp;perp;) =/= &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt; in contrast to &lt;code&gt;f &amp;perp; = &amp;perp;&lt;/code&gt;.
:::It's probably best to look up the exact denotational semantics of call-by-value in a paper/book to figure out how (or whether) to present strict semantics.

:::: Self-note: fixpoints in call-by-value are fine, it's just that the iterated functional is not strict in the value (and thus not internal to the language). In other words, a function &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; that starts the iteration with &amp;perp; would be rather useless in a call-by-value language.

== Partiality of &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; (in &quot;Strict functions&quot;) ==

FIXME: &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; defines a totally ordered set (toset) on [&lt;code&gt;[Integer]&lt;/code&gt;], so we have either &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsubseteq 5&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;5 \sqsubseteq 2&lt;/math&gt; or both ; if both were true, then 2 = 5, which would be effectively a contradiction, but we can still have either &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsubseteq 5&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;5 \sqsubseteq 2&lt;/math&gt; where one of these two predicates is true and the other is false. Such thing is easy to define by defining a semantic to &lt;math&gt;x \sqsubseteq y&lt;/math&gt; where ''x'' and ''y'' are both non-''undefined'' integers, using a &quot;friend&quot; toset on [&lt;code&gt;[Integer]&lt;/code&gt;]-{&lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;} (such as &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;). So 2 and 5 '''can be compared''' with &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt;.

Isn't there a confusion here between the toset &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; and the poset &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt; ?

-- 90.50.99.233

:Eh? The main point about &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\sqsubset&lt;/math&gt;) is that it's not a total ordering, exemplified in [[Haskell/Denotational semantics#Partial Functions and the Semantic Approximation Order]]. The choice that neither &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsubset 5&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsupset 5&lt;/math&gt; hold is intentional, the semantic approximation order only says whether one value (like &amp;perp;) is an approximation to another one (like &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;). The usual ordering &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; of integers is irrelevant here.

:Ah wait, no that's no problem. Monotone doesn't mean that the result is more defined than the orginal (&lt;math&gt;x \sqsubseteq g(x)&lt;/math&gt;), it means that a larger orgininal will be turned into a larger result (&lt;math&gt;x \sqsubseteq y \Rightarrow g(x) \sqsubseteq g(y)&lt;/math&gt;).

:What the text wants to say is the following: if monotone sequences are always finite, like in the case of &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;, then it's clear that the ordering is complete. Of course, this doesn't work for &lt;code&gt;Integer-&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;, but there is a (slightly) different argument that does show that the partial functions are a cpo, too.

== Haskell Recursion Example ==
I think it might be useful to point out that the &quot;let x = f x in x&quot; construction for the &quot;fix&quot; function actually uses the same least fixpoint semantics under the hoods.
Thus &quot;x = f x&quot; semantically means that &quot;x = fix(g)&quot;, where g = \x -&gt; f x, leading to x = lfp(f); Thus you are using the same semantics for recursive functions to denote recursive elements.

I think some extra explanation such as above is really useful as I can see many people becoming puzzled by reading this &quot;let x = f x in x&quot; construction because there could be many
fixpoint of f and it is not clear that the haskell semantics for functions are the same for these values.

:Sounds good. A new subsection on how the discussion applies to Haskell (touching on the examples &lt;code&gt;fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fix&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;let x = f x in&lt;/code&gt;) in the recursion chapter is probably the best way to incorporate that.

== Syntax and ''semantics'' ==

The word ''semantics'' is usually singular, much like ''physics'': “Denotational semantics gives meanings to programs,” “this language has this semantics,” etc. The CS literature is consistent on this point AFAIK. (The word can also be plural: “We consider several possible semantics, including call-by-value and call-by-name.” But that's not the usage anywhere in this text.)

== Stumbling block: Partial Functions and Approximation Order ==

Under &quot;Partial Functions and Approximation Order&quot;, I found the section discussing &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; , rather indigestible.  We have the para:

: This is contrasted to ordinary order predicate &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;, which can compare any two numbers. A quick way to remember this is the sentence: &quot;1 and 2 are different in terms of information content but are equal in terms of information quantity&quot;. That's another reason why we use a different symbol: &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt;.


&quot;A quick way to remember this&quot; -- What is &quot;this&quot; in this sentence?  Does it pertain to the immediately preceding &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt;? Or is it trying to describe &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; ? And what is ''content'' vs ''quantity''?

Further, the sentence &quot;1 and 2 are [...in some sense equal, in another sense not equal...]&quot; is followed by this:

: neither &lt;math&gt;1 \sqsubseteq 2&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsubseteq 1&lt;/math&gt; hold, but &lt;math&gt;1 \sqsubseteq 1&lt;/math&gt; holds.

Huh?  How does this statement using &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt;, where both expressions involving 1 and 2 do ''not'' hold, relate to the previous sentence which says that something about 1 and 2 ''does'' hold?

Hopefully someone can clarify this. [[User:Gwideman|Gwideman]] ([[User talk:Gwideman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gwideman|contribs]]) 06:17, 5 February 2013 (UTC)

------
I am similarly confused by this section. First it defines &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; as:
&lt;center&gt;... &lt;math&gt;a\sqsubseteq b&lt;/math&gt; will denote that either &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is more defined than &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; or both are equal (and so have the same definedness).&lt;/center&gt;

A little later we read:
&lt;center&gt;neither &lt;math&gt;1 \sqsubseteq 2&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsubseteq 1&lt;/math&gt; hold,&lt;/center&gt;

I would think that given the definition of &lt;math&gt;\sqsubseteq&lt;/math&gt; that both &lt;math&gt;1 \sqsubseteq 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsubseteq 1&lt;/math&gt; would hold. Aren't &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; equally defined, so both the relations hold?

Thanks in advance.

disclamer: I'm no expert

If both &lt;math&gt;1 \sqsubseteq 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsubseteq 1&lt;/math&gt; would hold,
then the antisymmetry law of posets would be broken, since &lt;math&gt;1 \neq 2&lt;/math&gt;

Antisymmetry: if both &lt;math&gt;x \sqsubseteq y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \sqsubseteq x&lt;/math&gt; hold, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; must be equal: &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt;.

So you either don't define &lt;math&gt;1 \sqsubseteq 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 \sqsubseteq 1&lt;/math&gt;
or you say both are false.
In both cases you break a law of the total ordered sets, which seems to be the reason Integer is a poset instead of a total ordered set.

Maybe you could just deny that Integer is a poset(or total order) and make &lt;math&gt;1 \sqsubseteq 2 \and 2 \sqsubseteq 1&lt;/math&gt; true,
but I guess that would be unneccecarily complicated.

== Interpreting factorial as a set ==

The article currently says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Now that we have a means to describe partial functions, we can give an interpretation to recursive definitions. Lets take the prominent example of the factorial function &lt;math&gt;f(n)=n!&lt;/math&gt; whose recursive definition is

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(n) = \mbox{ if } n == 0 \mbox{ then } 1
\mbox{ else } n \cdot f(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Although we saw that interpreting this directly as a set description may lead to problems, …
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When did we saw that? What is that referring to? Is it another article? (In that case, I think a link should be there.) Or is it something that was removed since? (Then this should be rewritten.) Or did I just miss something? [[User:Svick|Svick]] ([[User talk:Svick|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Svick|contribs]]) 22:04, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

[[Image:Census-reading-hi.jpg|thumb|right|296px|At Wikijunior, we are writing books for children.]]
===Welcome to Wikijunior===
The aim of this project is to produce a series of full-color booklets for children aged 8 to 11. The  subjects will be appealing to kids, and the writing will be light and friendly. These booklets will be richly illustrated with photographs, diagrams, sketches, and original drawings. The texts will also follow a format, so that each booklet, while different, will also have certain common features.

Development will happen online here at Wikibooks, and some of the finished books will go into print. In the future, a static online version of Wikijunior will be set up as a new project and &quot;completed&quot; versions will go there. However even the &quot;completed&quot; versions will be updated from time to time with changes posted to Wikibooks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the United Kingdom, something is only taxed if there is a specific provision taxing it. If there is no such provision, it is not taxed. For instance, if someone, other than your employer, gave you £100 as a gift, then you will not be taxed on it. 

The specific provisions applying to the taxation of income have their history in the 18th century, when income tax was introduced. There were a number of Schedules to the Income Tax Act that raised different charges on different sorts of income. Two of these still remain, and it is only if income falls within one of these Schedules that it falls to be taxed. The Schedules are:

*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]] (which deals with income from UK land); and
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule D]] (which deals with all income that is taxable, but which doesn't fall within Schedule A).

The Schedules are defined (more obviously now than in the past!) so that any source of income can fall within at most one Schedule. This has been confirmed by case law.

;The Cases of Schedule D

Schedule D is itself divided into a number of Cases. Four of these still remain&lt;ref&gt;Technically there is also a Case II, which taxes profits in respect of any profession or vocation not covered by another Schedule. However, as &quot;trade&quot; for corporation tax purposes includes these, it is not thought possible for a company to be charged to tax under Case II. The rules for Case II are almost identical to Case I in any instance.&lt;/ref&gt;:

*Case I - tax in respect of any trade carried on in the United Kingdom or elsewhere but not contained in Schedule A
*Case III - tax in respect of (i) items falling within the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Corporation tax/Loan relationships|loan relationship]] legislation taxed under Case III by virtue of Chapter II of Part IV of the Finance Act 1996; (ii) any annuity or other payment which is payable in respect of anything other than a loan relationship (Essentially Case III covers non-trading interest-type income)
*Case V - Overseas income (apart from that falling within Case III)
*Case VI - tax in respect of any annual profits or gains not falling under any other Case of Schedule D or Schedule A&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The definitions of the Cases of Schedule D do not allow income to fall within both Case VI and one of the other Cases. Nor, because of the way Case V is defined can a source of income fall within both Case III and Case V. However, a source of income can fall within Case I and one of Cases III or V. This could happen, for example, when you have a UK-resident company that has a trade in the UK and overseas. Income from that foreign trade falls within Case I (as it is trading income), and within Case V (as it is overseas income). Where income falls both within Case I and one of Cases III and V, it is only taxed once, and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/HM Revenue and Customs|HM Revenue and Customs]] decide which Case to tax under&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Paragraph 84 of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998|Paragraph 84 of Schedule 18 to the Finance Act 1998]] sets out the rules. The taxpayer must provide to HMRC any relevant documents HMRC require to make their decision. HMRC are likely to choose to tax under whatever Case gives the higher tax liability, and case law suggests that they are obliged to do that. In practice, under [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Corporation tax self assessment|self assessment]], the company will prepare its tax return on the basis it wishes to adopt, and will only change it if later required to do so by HMRC.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Chargeable gains

In addition to being taxed on their income, companies are also taxed on any [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definition/Chargeable gain|chargeable (ie capital) gains]] they make that are not taxed under the provisions relating to income (Schedule A and Schedule D).&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 6 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1998|Section 6 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 8 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992|Section 8 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; What constitutes a chargeable gain is defined in the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.

;Loans to participators of close companies

When a loan is made to a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Participator|participator]] of a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Close company|close company]], there may be an additional charge made to corporation tax as a result. Roughly, a close company is a company controlled by five or fewer participators (normally just shareholders, but it can include large loan creditors), or controlled by its directors - though for a full definition, and for more information about this charge and other provisions relating to close companies, see [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Corporation tax/Close companies]]. 

;Controlled foreign companies

A charge may be made on a company in certain circumstances in respect of profits made by a foreign company it has an interest in. The charge to tax here is not within the Schedular system. The controlled foreign company provisions fall under the &quot;anti-avoidance&quot; banner.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 747 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 747(3) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Corporation tax/Anti-avoidance/Controlled foreign companies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The rate of corporation tax is determined by reference to the financial year. A financial year runs from 1 April to the following 31 March. So, Financial Year FY06 started on 1 April 2006 and will end on 31 March 2007. The main rate of corporation tax is 30%. However, lower rates are sometimes applicable.

Notes:
#The bands shown on the right hand side are divided by one plus the number of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Associate|associates]] (usually the only associates a company has are fellow group companies, but the term is more widely defined)&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 13 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 13]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 13AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 13AA]] of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
#The reduced rates do not apply to close investment holding companies (companies controlled by fewer than 5 people (plus associates) or by their directors/managers, whose main activity is the holding of investments). Nor do they apply to companies in liquidation after the first 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 13A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 13A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]].&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Authorised unit trust|Authorised unit trusts]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Open-ended investment company|open-ended investment companies]] are taxed at the lower rate of income tax, which, for 2005/6 is 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 468 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 468(1A) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Insurance company|Life assurance companies]] are taxed using the above rate on [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Shareholder profits of life assurance companies|shareholder profits]] and the lower rate of income tax, which, for 2005/6 is 20%, on [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Policy holder profits of life assurance companies|policy holder profits]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 88 of the Finance Act 1989|Section 88(1) of the Finance Act 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Companies active in the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Ring-fenced trade|oil and gas extraction industry]] in the UK or on the [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/UK continental shelf|UK continental shelf]] are subject to an additional 10% charge on their profits from those activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 501A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 501A(1) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Non-corporate distribution rate

For [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Definitions/Distribution|distributions]] made between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2006 a non-corporate distribution rate of 19% was levied. This measure ensured that all amounts distributed to non-corporates (eg individuals, trusts and personal representatives of deceased persons) suffered corporation tax of at a rate of at least 19%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 13AB of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 13AB of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule A2 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A2 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The best way to start learning a new application is to take a quick look at its interface. This sub-chapter tells you what's what in the iMovie window. This is only an overview of the interface, functions of the interface will be covered in the appropriate chapter.

==Opening iMovie==
To open iMovie, click the iMovie icon in the Dock, or Applications folder. You will then be presented with the iMovie welcome window. If you'd like to see the iMovie interface, create a new project (settings explained in next chapter).

[[Image:IMovie_Welcome.png|thumb|600 px|center|Fig. 1 - The iMovie Welcome window.]]

==The iMovie Interface==

===The iMovie Window===
[[Image:IMovie_Interface.png|thumb|600 px|center|Fig. 2 - The iMovie interface.]]

This is the iMovie HD 6 interface. The best way to get used to it is to play around with it, but here's a summary of what everything does:

*At the top is the name of your project, and the format it is being created in. 
*The black area is where you view what you're working on.
*The area to the right of the black area changes to show different panels, but it is by default in Clip view.
*The buttons in the middle-left, of a clip and a clock, are for switching between timeline and clip view. Timeline view arranges the clips so that the visual length of a clip represents it's actual length. Timeline view is good for most editing. Clip view shows all clips as the same size visually, and is best for organizing.
*To the right of the timeline/clip view selector is the import/edit switch. When the switch is turned to the video camera, you can import video from your video camera. When it it turned towards the scissors, you can edit the clips.
*To the right of the edit/import switch are the play controls. The first play control (|&lt;&lt;), goes to the beginning of the movie.
*The second play control (&gt;), plays the movie.
*The last play control (&gt; with box), plays the movie in full screen.
*The volume control adjusts the playback volume of your entire project.
*The Clips/Themes/Media/Editing/Chapters buttons switch between said views. These views are explained later. 
*The check marked boxes on the far right side of Timeline view toggle sound for that track of media.
*The slider on the bottom left adjusts the appearance of clip length.
*The clip volume level section in the bottom left adjusts the sound level of the selected clip.
*On the bottom right corner, the trash button and status, and available space on the current hard drive are displayed.

{{Mac Note Box|Many common functions in iMovie have a shortcut. Using shortcuts speeds up work, and makes it easier, too. To view iMovie shortcuts, go to Help &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts }}

===The iMovie Menu bar===
[[Image:Imovie_menubar.png|thumb|600 px|center|Fig. 3 - The iMovie menu bar.]]

The iMovie menu bar works like any other OS X application's menu bar. Help, shortcuts, tutorials, and support are under the Help menu. The Share menu shows you options for exporting. The Edit and Advanced menus have options that are only found in iMovie, such as Edit &gt; Split Video Clip at Playhead, so you should explore the menus. The Markers menu has options for creating bookmarks. Other menus are similar in function to other applications.

===Preferences===
Annoyed by that click every time you slide the playhead over a cut? Want to change the default frame rate? Check out iMovie's Preferences in iMovie &gt; Preferences

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cramps'''

There are two basic causes of cramping. One is inadequate oxygenation of muscle, and the other is lack of water or salt. Cramps from poor oxygenation can be improved by rapid deep breathing, and stretching the muscle. Cramps from lack of salt and water can be treated by stretching the muscle, drinking water and eating salt. Pounding on the muscle can increase soreness.

What happens in a cramp is that lactic acid builds up because of normal anaerobic muscle metabolism. When the muscle burns sugar without enough oxygen, it makes lactic acid. The lactic acid finally becomes concentrated enough to trigger the contraction of the muscle. When the muscle lacks salt, the nerves firing the muscle are unable to recharge properly, causing a similar effect.

Choose a meeting place well away from the house so that if a real fire occurs, everyone will know to go there, and if anyone is missing, it can be assumed that they are still in the house.  Go over the escape routes with everyone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Packages are a facility in Common Lisp to divide the namespace.  Packages allow one to isolate all of their function, macro, and variable definitions from the rest of the system.  This reduces the number of problems that occur with name collisions, or two people using the same name for different things.

A symbol has the printed form PACKAGE-NAME::SYMBOL-NAME, however, if we are currently in package PACKAGE-NAME, then the printer will just print SYMBOL-NAME.  The dynamic variable *PACKAGE* always specifies the current package.  When interned, a symbol is interned in the package that *PACKAGE* names, unless the package name is specified via the ‘::’ notation.

A package is defined with DEFPACKAGE.  A package may EXPORT any of its symbols in which case they may be designated by PACKAGE-NAME:SYMBOL-NAME, i.e. only one ‘:’.  A package may also IMPORT a symbol from any other package.  If a symbol is imported that has the same name as a different symbol that was already interned in the package, then an error occurs.  You will have to choose one symbol.  USE-PACKAGE helps one import the API from a package.  The symbols that a package exports and the packages that a package uses may be specified via DEFPACKAGE.

==Example: List all Symbols in a Package==

Common Lisp provides some macros to iterate through the symbols of a package. The two most interesting are: [http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_do_sym.htm DO-SYMBOLS and DO-EXTERNAL-SYMBOLS]. DO-SYMBOLS iterates over the symbols accessible in the package and DO-EXTERNAL-SYMBOLS only iterates over the external symbols (you can see them as the real package API).

To print all exported symbols of a package named &quot;PACKAGE&quot;, you can write:

&lt;pre&gt;
(do-external-symbols (s (find-package &quot;PACKAGE&quot;))
  (print s))
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also collect all these symbols in a list by writing:

&lt;pre&gt;
(let (symbols)
  (do-external-symbols (s (find-package &quot;PACKAGE&quot;))
    (push s symbols))
  symbols)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or you can do it with LOOP.

&lt;pre&gt;
(loop for s being the external-symbols of (find-package &quot;PACKAGE&quot;)
      collect s)
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">If possible, and only if you can do it safely-locate the fire. Remember to stay calm.  Alert any other people that are in the building, preferably by pulling the nearest fire alarm (when in a public building). If the fire is small and a fire extinguisher is handy, an attempt to put the fire out should be made.  If the fire is already large, or you fail to extinguish it, you must evacuate the building as safely and as quickly as possible. Keep in mind that fires can spread very quickly so it is better to err on the side of caution by getting the fire department started before the fire is out of control. 

Feel any door before opening it, and if it is hot, do not open it.  Try to exit the building without going through an area that is in flames, then stop, drop, and crawl. Call the fire department.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
This sub-chapter will cover what kinds of projects iMovie can create, formats they can be in, and storage of projects.

==Project Creation==
===Regular Projects===
[[Image:Imovie_new_project.png|thumb|600px|center|Fig. 1 - Create a new Project]]

This is the most common way to use iMovie. This is what you should use if you want to edit your movie. To create one, select &quot;Create New Project&quot;, either in the Welcome window, or File &gt; New.

===Magic iMovie===
[[Image:Magic_imovie.png|thumb|600px|center|Fig. 2 - Magic iMovie Project button]]

The Magic iMovie project can import video from your video camera, apply a transition between clips, add a soundtrack, then send the finished product to iDVD. No magical talent required. You can edit Magic iMovie projects the conventional way as well, once created. To create one, press the &quot;Make a Magic iMovie&quot; button in the iMovie welcome window or press File &gt; Make a Magic iMovie. You must define a new project name if you are creating a new Magic iMovie project while in an iMovie project, otherwise, the Magic iMovie will be added to the end of the current project.

===Project Settings===
[[Image:Imovie new setup.png|thumb|600px|center|Fig. 3 - The dialog box for creating a new project in iMovie]]

{{Mac Note Box|Above are the expanded options for saving. To view expanded options, click the triangle to the right of the Project Name field, and to the left of the Video Format text.}}

To keep things organized, you should save iMovie projects in the Movies folder, unless you have your own filing system. If you're running out of space on your boot drive, you should save to an external drive. You should always have a few gigabytes of free space, because OS X uses hard drive space for virtual memory, boot up, logs, etc. If OS X runs out of space, you will start having system errors. 

Most video cameras use DV format, high-definition or specialized video cameras may use alternate formats. The format types are explained if you select one.

Once you've selected the correct settings for your use, click &quot;Create&quot;

==Saving and Opening==
===The Basics===
iMovie can be a heavy application for your computer to run. Because of this, it is important to save early, and save often to avoid loosing work. You can open a specific iMovie project (usually located in the Movies folder) by double clicking it.

===Burning===
If you'd like to work on your iMovie project somewhere else, or you want to archive it, it's easy to do with iMovie. Simply click File &gt; Burn Project to Disk...

{{Mac Note Box|This does '''not''' create a playable DVD, it simply burns the iMovie project files to a disk.}}

===Application Failure===
If iMovie unexpectedly quits, all is not lost. Imported media files are still in the iMovie project, but changes to the timeline will not be saved. iMovie will prompt you if it recovers files:

      <text xml:space="preserve">* What type of the book? Reference, textbook, self-study course, (application) note collection, tutorial, experimentation instructions, travel report, etc.?
:This book is a textbook and reference for advanced undergraduate or begining graduate macroeconomics.  It is based on notes taken at Cornell University in 2006-2007, although much of the material will be taken from a wide variety of sources.  The errors are, of course, the fault of the authors.
* What scope? Where to start? Where to end? What is in, what is out?
:This book will endeavor first to cover all subjects that are likely to be found on a comprehensive exam for a graduate economics program.  The culmination, indeed the body, of many of the chapters should be an analysis of a problem in its general form.
:To break down the work to be done on each chapter into four pieces, we have:
:*First, the subject is introduced, with the back story.
:*Second, the subject is shaped into a problem in a general form with only limited assumptions on functional forms, etc. 
:*Third, the solution to the problem in general form is worked out.
:*Fourth, an example is discussed, graphics are added.
*I do not intend to discuss many examples or add many graphics to the book before April of 2007.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Scarlet Letter==
Hawthorne's tale revolves around the life of Hester Prynee after having been forced to wear the mark of an A on her blouse; the A originally stood for Adultery, the crime which Hester committed, yet was later taken to stand for able. Hawthorne is critical of the Puritan morality that he thought was preoccupied with punishing other's sins.

==Extract One==
In this extract, Hawthorne shows us a crowd that waits for Hester Prynne to leave the prison and to make her way to the place where she will be publicly humiliated.
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#B0E0E6&quot;&gt;

&quot;Goodwives,&quot; said a hard-featured dame of fifty, &quot;I'll tell ye a piece of my mind. It would be greatly for the public behoof, if we women, being of mature age and church-members in good repute, should have the handling of such malefactresses as this Hester Prynne. What think ye, gossips? If the hussy stood up for judgment before us five, that are now here in a knot together, would she come off with such a sentence as the worshipful magistrates have awarded? Marry, I trow not!&quot;

&quot;People say,&quot; said another, &quot;that the Reverend Master Dimmesdale, her godly pastor, takes it very grievously to heart that such a scandal should have come upon his congregation.&quot;

&quot;The magistrates are God-fearing gentlemen, but merciful overmuch,—that is a truth,&quot; added a third autumnal matron. &quot;At the very least, they should have put the brand of a hot iron on Hester Prynne's forehead. Madame Hester would have winced at that, I warrant me. But she,—the naughty baggage,—little will she care what they put upon the bodice of her gown! Why, look you, she may cover it with a brooch, or such like, heathenish adornment, and so walk the streets as brave as ever!&quot;

&quot;Ah, but,&quot; interposed, more softly, a young wife, holding a child by the hand, &quot;let her cover the mark as she will, the pang of it will be always in her heart.&quot;

&quot;What do we talk of marks and brands, whether on the bodice of her gown, or the flesh of her forehead?&quot; cried another female, the ugliest as well as the most pitiless of these self-constituted judges. &quot;This woman has brought shame upon us all, and ought to die. Is there not law for it? Truly there is, both in the Scripture and the statute-book. Then let the magistrates, who have made it of no effect, thank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray!&quot;

&quot;Mercy on us, goodwife,&quot; exclaimed a man in the crowd, &quot;is there no virtue in woman, save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows? That is the hardest word yet! Hush, now, gossips; for the lock is turning in the prison-door, and here comes Mistress Prynne herself.&quot; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

===Explanation and Analysis===

Hawthorne's commentary is revealed in this extract through the characterization of the members of the crowd. Consider how the first woman to speak is described - 'a hard-featured dame of fifty'. This is certainly not a flattering description. She asks the crowd to let her 'tell ye a piece of my mind'. Her dialogue is coarse and unforgiving - 'if the hussy stood up for judgement'. She is not only 'hard-featured' but also very judgemental, unforgiving and moralistic. Also notice that the only one to sympathize with young Hester was the young female holding a child by the hand, thus re-emphasizing the rosebush representing a new era and hope for the future compared to the rusting iron door.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==HISTORICAL NOTES==

In June 1774, the Virginia and Massachusetts assemblies independently proposed an intercolonial meeting of delegates from the several colonies to restore union and harmony between Great Britain and her American Colonies. Pursuant to these calls there met in Philadelphia in September of that year the first Continental Congress, composed of delegates from 12 colonies. On [[1774-10-14]], the assembly adopted what has become to be known as the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress. In that instrument, addressed to his Majesty and to the people of Great Britain, there was embodied a statement of rights and principles, many of which were later to be incorporated in the Declaration of Independence and the Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;The colonists, for example, claimed the right &quot;to life, liberty, and property&quot;, &quot;the rights, liberties, and immunities of free and natural-born subjects within the realm of England&quot;; the right to participate in legislative councils; ``the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of [the common law of England]&quot;; &quot;the immunities and privileges granted and confirmed to them by royal charters, or secured by their several codes of provincial laws&quot;; a right peaceably to assemble, consider of their grievances, and petition the king.&quot; They further declared that the keeping of a standing army in the colonies in time of peace without the consent of the colony in which the army was kept was &quot;against law&quot;; that it was &quot;indispensably necessary to good government, and rendered essential by the English constitution, that the constituent branches of the legislature be independent of each other&quot;; that certain acts of Parliament in contravention of the foregoing principles were &quot;infringement and violations of the rights of the colonists.&quot; Text in C. Tansill (ed.), Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the Union of the American States, H. Doc. No. 358, 69th Congress, 1st sess. (1927), 1. See also H. Commager (ed.), Documents of American History (New York; 8th ed. 1964), 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

This Congress adjourned in October with a recommendation that another Congress be held in Philadelphia the following May. Before its successor met, the battle of Lexington had been fought. In Massachusetts the colonists had organized their own government in defiance of the royal governor and the Crown. Hence, by general necessity and by common consent, the second Continental Congress assumed control of the &quot;Twelve United Colonies&quot;, soon to become the &quot;Thirteen United Colonies&quot; by the cooperation of Georgia. It became a de facto government; it called upon the other colonies to assist in the defense of Massachusetts; it issued bills of credit; it took steps to organize a military force, and appointed George Washington commander in chief of the Army.

While the declaration of the causes and necessities of taking up arms of 1775-07-06,&lt;ref&gt;Text in Tansill, op. cit., 10.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed a &quot;wish&quot; to see the union between Great Britain and the colonies &quot;restored&quot;, sentiment for independence was growing. Finally, on 1776-05-15, Virginia instructed her delegates to the Continental Congress to have that body &quot;declare the united colonies free and independent States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Id., 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly on June 7 a resolution was introduced in Congress declaring the union with Great Britain dissolved, proposing the formation of foreign alliances, and suggesting the drafting of a plan of confederation to be submitted to the respective colonies.4&lt;ref&gt;Id., 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some delegates argued for confederation first and declaration afterwards. This counsel did not prevail. Independence was declared on 1776-07-04; the preparation of a plan of confederation was postponed. It was not until November 17, 1777, that the Congress was able to agree on a form of government which stood some chance of being approved by the separate States. The Articles of Confederation were then submitted to the several States, and on 1778-07-09, were finally approved by a sufficient number to become operative.

Weaknesses inherent in the Articles of Confederation became apparent before the Revolution out of which that instrument was born had been concluded. Even before the thirteenth State (Maryland) conditionally joined the &quot;firm league of friendship&quot; on March 1, 1781, the need for a revenue amendment was widely conceded. Congress under the Articles lacked authority to levy taxes. She could only request the States to contribute their fair share to the common treasury, but the requested amounts were not forthcoming. To remedy this defect, Congress applied to the States for power to lay duties and secure the public debts. Twelve States agreed to such an amendment, but Rhode Island refused her consent, thereby defeating the proposal.

Thus was emphasized a second weakness in the Articles of Confederation, namely, the liberum veto which each State possessed whenever amendments to that instrument were proposed. Not only did all amendments have to be ratified by each of the 13 States, but all important legislation needed the approval of 9 States. With several delegations often absent, one or two States were able to defeat legislative proposals of major importance.

Other imperfections in the Articles of Confederation also proved embarrassing. Congress could, for example, negotiate treaties with foreign powers, but all treaties had to be ratified by the several States. Even when a treaty was approved, Congress lacked authority to secure obedience to its stipulations. Congress could not act directly upon the States or upon individuals. Under such circumstances foreign nations doubted the value of a treaty with the new Republic.

Furthermore, Congress had no authority to regulate foreign or interstate commerce. Legislation in this field, subject to unimportant exceptions, was left to the individual States. Disputes between States with common interests in the navigation of certain rivers and bays were inevitable. Discriminatory regulations were followed by reprisals.

Virginia, recognizing the need for an agreement with Maryland respecting the navigation and jurisdiction of the Potomac River, appointed in June 1784, four commissioners to &quot;frame such liberal and equitable regulations concerning the said river as may be mutually advantageous to the two States.&quot; Maryland in January 1785 responded to the Virginia resolution by appointing a like number of commissioners&lt;ref&gt;George Mason, Edmund Randolph, James Madison, and Alexander Henderson were appointed commissioners for Virginia; Thomas Johnson, Thomas Stone, Samuel Chase, and Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer for Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;for the purpose of settling the navigation and jurisdiction over that part of the bay of Chesapeake which lies within the limits of Virginia, and over the rivers Potomac and Pocomoke&quot; with full power on behalf of Maryland &quot;to adjudge and settle the jurisdiction to be exercised by the said State, respectively, over the waters and navigations of the same.&quot;

At the invitation of Washington the commissioners met at Mount Vernon, in March 1785, and drafted a compact which, in many of its details relative to the navigation and jurisdiction of the Potomac, is still in force.&lt;ref&gt;Text of the resolution and details of the compact may be found in Wheaton v. Wise, 153 U.S. 155 (1894).&lt;/ref&gt; What is more important, the commissioners submitted to their respective States a report in favor of a convention of all the States &quot;to take into consideration the trade and commerce&quot; of the Confederation. Virginia, in January 1786, advocated such a convention, authorizing its commissioners to meet with those of other States, at a time and place to be agreed on, &quot;to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to examine the relative situations and trade of the said State; to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony; and to report to the several State, such an act relative to this great object, as when unanimously ratified by them, will enable the United States in Congress, effectually to provide for the same.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Transill, op. cit., 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

This proposal for a general trade convention seemingly met with general approval; nine States appointed commissioners. Under the leadership of the Virginia delegation, which included Randolph and Madison, Annapolis was accepted as the place and the first Monday in September 1786 as the time for the convention. The attendance at Annapolis proved disappointing. Only five States--Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and New York--were represented; delegates from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island failed to attend. Because of the small representation, the Annapolis convention did not deem &quot;it advisable to proceed on the business of their mission.&quot; After an exchange of views, the Annapolis delegates unanimously submitted to their respective States a report in which they suggested that a convention of representatives from all the States meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday in May 1787 to examine the defects in the existing system of government and formulate &quot;a plan for supplying such defects as may be discovered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Id., 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Virginia legislature acted promptly upon this recommendation and appointed a delegation to go to Philadelphia. Within a few weeks New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Delaware, and Georgia also made appointments. New York and several other States hesitated on the ground that, without the consent of the Continental Congress, the work of the convention would be extra-legal; that Congress alone could propose amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Washington was quite unwilling to attend an irregular convention. Congressional approval of the proposed convention became, therefore, highly important. After some hesitancy Congress approved the suggestion for a convention at Philadelphia &quot;for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation and reporting to Congress and the several legislatures such alterations and provisions therein as shall when agreed to in Congress and confirmed by the States render the Federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of Government and the preservation of the Union.&quot;

Thereupon, the remaining States, Rhode Island alone excepted, appointed in due course delegates to the Convention, and Washington accepted membership on the Virginia delegation.

Although scheduled to convene on May 14, 1787, it was not until May 25 that enough delegates were present to proceed with the organization of the Convention. Washington was elected as presiding officer. It was agreed that the sessions were to be strictly secret.

On May 29 Randolph, on behalf of the Virginia delegation, submitted to the convention 15 propositions as a plan of government. Despite the fact that the delegates were limited by their instructions to a revision of the Articles, Virginia had really recommended a new instrument of government. For example, provision was made in the Virginia plan for the separation of the three branches of government; under the Articles executive, legislative, and judicial powers were vested in the Congress. Furthermore the legislature was to consist of two houses rather than one.

On May 30 the Convention went into a committee of the whole to consider the 15 propositions of the Virginia plan seriatim . These discussion continued until June 13, when the Virginia resolutions in amended form were reported out of committee. They provided for proportional representation in both houses. The small States were dissatisfied. Therefore, on June 14 when the Convention was ready to consider the report on the Virginia plan, Paterson of New Jersey requested an adjournment to allow certain delegations more time to prepare a substitute plan. The request was granted, and on the next day Paterson submitted nine resolutions embodying important changes in the Articles of Confederation, but strictly amendatory in nature. Vigorous debate followed. On June 19 the States rejected the New Jersey plan and voted to proceed with a discussion of the Virginia plan. The small States became more and more discontented; there were threats of withdrawal. On July 2, the Convention was deadlocked over giving each State an equal vote in the upper house--five States in the affirmative, five in the negative, one divided.&lt;ref&gt;The New Hampshire delegation did not arrive until July 23, 1787.&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem was referred to a committee of 11, there being 1 delegate from each State, to effect a compromise. On July 5 the committee submitted its report, which became the basis for the ``great compromise'' of the Convention. It was recommended that in the upper house each State should have an equal vote, that in the lower branch each State should have one representative for every 40,000 inhabitants, counting three-fifths of the slaves, that money bills should originate in the lower house (not subject to amendment by the upper chamber). When on July 12 the motion of Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania that direct taxation should also be in proportion to representation was adopted, a crisis had been successfully surmounted. A compromise spirit began to prevail. The small States were not willing to support a strong national government.

Debates on the Virginia resolutions continued. The 15 original resolutions had been expanded into 23. Since these resolutions were largely declarations of principles, on July 24 a committee of five&lt;ref&gt;Rutledge of South Carolina, Randolph of Virginia, Gorham of Massachusetts, Ellsworth of Connecticut, and Wilson of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; was elected to draft a detailed constitution embodying the fundamental principles which had thus far been approved. The Convention adjourned from July 26 to August 6 to await the report of its committee of detail. This committee, in preparing its draft of a Constitution, turned for assistance to the State constitutions, to the Articles of Confederation, to the various plans which had been submitted to the Convention and other available material. On the whole the report of the committee conformed to the resolutions adopted by the Convention, though on many clauses the members of the committee left the imprint of their individual and collective judgments. In a few instances the committee avowedly exercised considerable discretion.

From August 6 to September 10 the report of the committee of detail was discussed, section by section, clause by clause. Details were attended to, further compromises were effected. Toward the close of these discussions, on September 8, another committee of five11&lt;ref&gt;William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut, Alexander Hamilton of New York, Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania, James Madison of Virginia, and Rufus King of Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed &quot;to revise the style of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the house.&quot;

On Wednesday, September 12, the report of the committee of style was ordered printed for the convenience of the delegates. The Convention for 3 days compared this report with the proceedings of the Convention. The Constitution was ordered engrossed on Saturday, September 15.

The Convention met on Monday, September 17, for its final session. Several of the delegates were disappointed in the result. A few deemed the new Constitution a mere makeshift, a series of unfortunate compromises. The advocates of the Constitution, realizing the impending difficulty of obtaining the consent of the States to the new instrument of Government, were anxious to obtain the unanimous support of the delegations from each State. It was feared that many of the delegates would refuse to give their individual assent to the Constitution. Therefore, in order that the action of the Convention would appear to be unanimous, Gouverneur Morris devised the formula &quot;Done in Convention, by the unanimous consent of the States present the 17th of September…In witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names.&quot; Thirty-nine of the forty-two delegates present thereupon &quot;subscribed&quot; to the document.&lt;ref&gt;At least 65 persons had received appointments as delegates to the Convention; 55 actually attended at different times during the course of the proceedings; 39 signed the document. It has been estimated that generally fewer than 30 delegates attended the daily sessions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention had been called to revise the Articles of Confederation. Instead, it reported to the Continental Congress a new Constitution. Furthermore, while the Articles specified that no amendments should be effective until approved by the legislatures of all the States, the Philadelphia Convention suggested that the new Constitution should supplant the Articles of Confederation when ratified by conventions in nine States. For these reasons, it was feared that the new Constitution might arouse opposition in Congress.

Three members of the Convention--Madison, Gorham, and King--were also Members of Congress. They proceeded at once to New York, where Congress was in session, to placate the expected opposition. Aware of their vanishing authority, Congress on September 28, after some debate, decided to submit the Constitution to the States for action. It made no recommendation for or against adoption.

Two parties soon developed, one in opposition and one in support of the Constitution, and the Constitution was debated, criticized, and expounded clause by clause. Hamilton, Madison, and Jay wrote a series of commentaries, now known as the Federalist Papers, in support of the new instrument of government.&lt;ref&gt;These commentaries on the Constitution, written during the struggle for ratification, have been frequently cited by the Supreme Court as an authoritative contemporary interpretation of the meaning of 
its provisions.&lt;/ref&gt; The closeness and bitterness of the struggle over ratification and the conferring of additional powers on the central government can scarcely be exaggerated. In some States ratification was effected only after a bitter struggle in the State convention itself.

Delaware, on December 7, 1787, became the first State to ratify the new Constitution, the vote being unanimous. Pennsylvania ratified on December 12, 1787, by a vote of 46 to 23, a vote scarcely indicative of the struggle which had taken place in that State. New Jersey ratified on December 19, 1787, and Georgia on January 2, 1788, the vote in both States being unanimous. Connecticut ratified on January 9, 1788; yeas 128, nays 40. On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts, by a narrow margin of 19 votes in a convention with a membership of 355, endorsed the new Constitution, but recommended that a bill of rights be added to protect the States from federal encroachment on individual liberties. Maryland ratified on April 28, 1788; yeas 63, nays 11. South Carolina ratified on May 23, 1788; yeas 149, nays 73. On June 21, 1788, by a vote of 57 to 46, New Hampshire became the ninth State to ratify, but like Massachusetts she suggested a bill of rights.

By the terms of the Constitution nine States were sufficient for its establishment among the States so ratifying. The advocates of the new Constitution realized, however, that the new Government could not succeed without the addition of New York and Virginia, neither of which had ratified. Madison, Marshall, and Randolph led the struggle for ratification in Virginia. On June 25, 1788, by a narrow margin of 10 votes in a convention of 168 members, that State ratified over the objection of such delegates as George Mason and Patrick Henry. In New York an attempt to attach conditions to ratification almost succeeded. But on July 26, 1788, New York ratified, with a recommendation that a bill of rights be appended. The vote was close--yeas 30, nays 27.

Eleven States having thus ratified the Constitution,14&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina added her ratification on November 21, 1789; yeas 184, nays 77. Rhode Island did not ratify until May 29, 1790; yeas 34, nays 32.&lt;/ref&gt; the Continental Congress--which still functioned at irregular intervals--passed a resolution on September 13, 1788, to put the new Constitution into operation. The first Wednesday of January 1789 was fixed as the day for choosing presidential electors, the first Wednesday of February for the meeting of electors, and the first Wednesday of March (i.e. March 4, 1789) for the opening session of the new Congress. Owing to various delays, Congress was late in assembling, and it was not until April 30, 1789, that George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States.

:Thanks for the welcome.  I hope I can take your welcome to mean that when I have questions, I can bring them to you ; ).  Right now, I'm looking at the naming policy page, and it talks about the structure of books, but now how books and chapters are named.  Just getting started, I'm nervous about these issues.  But, it doesn't seem like naming chapters is as big of a deal as naming articles over on WP is.  Is this right? [[User:Smmurphy|Smmurphy]] 22:21, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Images ==

Hi Apfelmus. No problem deleting... I can't &quot;move them&quot;, but you can just re-upload it to the new filename and then mark the old file with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|re-uploaded under a new name}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and leave a link to the new image name so we can be sure.

One thing you might consider is uploading to [[commons:Main Page|Commons]] instead, that way if someone wants to translate your book or otherwise use it on another project, they won't have to re-upload it. 

BTW, if you want to make a link to an image file without making it appear on the page, use colons, so that &lt;nowiki&gt;[[:Image:Lacewing3035.jpg]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; makes [[:Image:Lacewing3035.jpg]] (you can still click through to get to the image page... note that it's on commons).--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:48, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

       ifconfig - configure a network interface

SYNOPSIS
       ifconfig [-v] [-a] [-s] [interface]
       ifconfig [-v] interface [aftype] options | address ...

DESCRIPTION
       Ifconfig  is  used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.
       It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary.  After that,
       it  is  usually  only  needed  when  debugging or when system tuning is
       needed.

       If no arguments are given, ifconfig displays the  status  of  the  cur‐
       rently  active interfaces.  If a single interface argument is given, it
       displays the status of the given interface only; if a single  -a  argu‐
       ment  is  given,  it  displays the status of all interfaces, even those
       that are down.  Otherwise, it configures an interface.


Address Families
       If the first argument after the interface name  is  recognized  as  the
       name  of  a  supported  address family, that address family is used for
       decoding and displaying all protocol  addresses.   Currently  supported
       address  families  include  inet  (TCP/IP, default), inet6 (IPv6), ax25
       (AMPR Packet Radio), ddp (Appletalk Phase  2),  ipx  (Novell  IPX)  and
       netrom (AMPR Packet radio).

OPTIONS
       -a     display  all  interfaces  which are currently available, even if
              down

       -s     display a short list (like netstat -i)

       -v     be more verbose for some error conditions

       interface
              The name of the interface.  This is usually a driver  name  fol‐
              lowed  by a unit number, for example eth0 for the first Ethernet
              interface. If your kernel supports  alias  interfaces,  you  can
              specify  them  with  eth0:0 for the first alias of eth0. You can
              use them to assign a second address. To delete an  alias  inter‐
              face use ifconfig eth0:0 down aliases are deleted, if you delete
              the first (primary).

       up     This flag causes the interface to be activated.  It  is  implic‐
              itly specified if an address is assigned to the interface.

       down   This  flag causes the driver for this interface to be shut down.

       [-]arp Enable or disable the use of the ARP protocol on this interface.

       [-]promisc
              Enable  or  disable  the  promiscuous mode of the interface.  If
              selected, all packets on the network will  be  received  by  the
              interface.

       [-]allmulti
              Enable  or  disable all-multicast mode.  If selected, all multi‐
              cast packets on the network will be received by the interface.

       metric N
              This parameter sets the interface metric.

       mtu N  This parameter sets the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of an inter‐
              face.

       dstaddr addr
              Set  the  remote  IP  address for a point-to-point link (such as
              PPP).  This keyword is now obsolete; use the pointopoint keyword
              instead.

       netmask addr
              Set the IP network mask for this interface.  This value defaults
              to the usual class A, B or C network mask (as derived  from  the
              interface IP address), but it can be set to any value.

       add addr/prefixlen
              Add an IPv6 address to an interface.

       del addr/prefixlen
              Remove an IPv6 address from an interface.

       tunnel aa.bb.cc.dd
              Create  a new SIT (IPv6-in-IPv4) device, tunnelling to the given
              destination.

       irq addr
              Set the interrupt line used by this device.  Not all devices can
              dynamically change their IRQ setting.

       io_addr addr
              Set the start address in I/O space for this device.

       mem_start addr
              Set  the  start  address  for shared memory used by this device.
              Only a few devices need this.

       media type
              Set the physical port or medium type to be used by  the  device.
              Not all devices can change this setting, and those that can vary
              in what values  they  support.   Typical  values  for  type  are
              10base2 (thin Ethernet), 10baseT (twisted-pair 10Mbps Ethernet),
              AUI (external transceiver) and so on.  The special  medium  type
              of  auto can be used to tell the driver to auto-sense the media.
              Again, not all drivers can do this.

       [-]broadcast [addr]
              If the address argument is given,  set  the  protocol  broadcast
              address  for  this  interface.   Otherwise,  set  (or clear) the
              IFF_BROADCAST flag for the interface.

       [-]pointopoint [addr]
              This keyword enables the point-to-point mode  of  an  interface,
              meaning  that  it  is  a  direct  link between two machines with
              nobody else listening on it.
              If the address argument is also given, set the protocol  address
              of  the  other  side of the link, just like the obsolete dstaddr
              keyword does.  Otherwise, set or clear the IFF_POINTOPOINT  flag
              for the interface.

       hw class address
              Set the hardware address of this interface, if the device driver
              supports this operation.  The keyword must be  followed  by  the
              name of the hardware class and the printable ASCII equivalent of
              the hardware  address.   Hardware  classes  currently  supported
              include  ether  (Ethernet), ax25 (AMPR AX.25), ARCnet and netrom
              (AMPR NET/ROM).

       multicast
              Set the multicast flag on the interface. This  should  not  nor‐
              mally   be   needed  as  the  drivers  set  the  flag  correctly
              themselves.

       address
              The IP address to be assigned to this interface.

       txqueuelen length
              Set the length of the transmit queue of the device. It is useful
              to  set  this  to  small  values  for slower devices with a high
              latency (modem links, ISDN) to prevent fast bulk transfers  from
              disturbing interactive traffic like telnet too much.

NOTES
       Since kernel release 2.2 there are no explicit interface statistics for
       alias interfaces anymore.  The  statistics  printed  for  the  original
       address  are shared with all alias addresses on the same device. If you
       want per-address statistics you should add  explicit  accounting  rules
       for the address using the ipchains(8) or iptables(8) command.

       Since  net-tools  1.60-4  ifconfig  is printing byte counters and human
       readable counters with IEC 60027-2 units. So 1 KiB are 2^10 byte. Note,
       the  numbers  are  truncated to one decimal (which can by quite a large
       error if you consider 0.1 PiB is 112.589.990.684.262 bytes :)

       Interrupt problems with Ethernet device drivers fail with EAGAIN (SIOC‐
       SIIFLAGS:  Resource temporarily unavailable) it is most likely a inter‐
       rupt conflict.  See  http://www.scyld.com/expert/irq-conflict.html  for
       more information.

I'm not quite sure what this book is supposed to be. Perhaps it could be added to the [[Judaism]] page or [[Old Testament Commentaries]] or [[Bible Topics]] or [[Biblical Studies/Christianity/The Bible]]. Those pages all look like they could use some more content. If there's any actually useful information about this Solomon character in there (I wouldn't know), it might be okay to transfer the knowledge there. But I don't think this justifies the creation of an entire book. -[[User:Monk|Monk]] 01:25, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ANSI Common Lisp standard doesn't mention this topic. So almost everything that can be said here depends on your OS and your implementation.

==Example: Calling 'gethostname' from CLISP==

Note: You should read the [http://clisp.cons.org/impnotes/dffi.html relevant chapter] from the CLISP implementation notes before you proceed.

int gethostname(char *name, int len) follows a typical pattern of C &quot;out&quot;-parameter convention - it expects a pointer to a buffer it's going to fill. So you must view this parameter as either :OUT or :IN-OUT. Additionally, one must tell the function the size of the buffer. Here len is just an :IN parameter. Sometimes this will be an :IN-OUT parameter, returning the number of bytes actually filled in.

So name is actually a pointer to the first character of an array of up to len characters, to be used like a C string (0-termination). How many elements are in the array? Luckily, in our case, you can find it out without calculating the sizeof() a C structure. It's a hostname that will be returned. The Solaris 2.x manpage says &quot;Host names are limited to MAXHOSTNAMELEN characters, currently 256.&quot;

Also, in the present example, you can use allocation :ALLOCA, like you'd do in C: stack-allocate a temporary. Why make things worse when using Lisp than when using C?

This yields the following useful signature for your foreign function:

&lt;pre&gt;
(ffi:def-c-call-out gethostname
  (:arguments (name (ffi:c-ptr (ffi:c-array-max ffi:char 256))
		    :out :alloca)
	      (len ffi:int))
  ;; (:return-type BOOLEAN) could have been used here
  ;; (Solaris says it's either 0 or -1).
  (:return-type ffi:int))

(defun myhostname ()
  (multiple-value-bind (success name)
      ;; :OUT or :IN-OUT parameters are returned via multiple values
      (gethostname 256)
    (if (zerop success)
	(subseq name 0 (position #\null name))
	(error ... ; errno may be set
          ...))))
(defvar hostname (myhostname))
&lt;/pre&gt;

Possibly SUBSEQ and POSITION are superfluous, thanks to C-ARRAY-MAX as opposed to C-ARRAY:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun myhostname ()
  (multiple-value-bind (success name)
      ;; :out or :in-out parameters are returned via multiple values
      (gethostname 256)
    (if (zerop success) name
	(error ... ; errno may be set
          ...))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Example: Calling 'gethostname' from Allegro CL==

This is how the same example above would be written in Allegro Common Lisp version 6 and above. ACL doesn't explicitely distinguish between input and output arguments. The way to declare an argument as output (i.e., modifiable by C) is to use an array, since arrays are passed by reference and C therefore receives a pointer to a memory location (which is what it expects). In this case things are made even easier by the fact that gethostname() expects an array of char, and a SIMPLE-ARRAY of CHARACTER represents essentially the same thing in Lisp. The foreign function definition is therefore the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
(def-foreign-call (c-get-hostname &quot;gethostname&quot;)
	 ((name (* :char) (simple-array 'character (*)))
	  (len :int integer))
  :returning :int)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Let's read this line by line: this form defines a Lisp function called C-GET-HOSTNAME that calls the C function gethostname(). It takes two arguments: the first one, called NAME, is a pointer to a char (*char in C), and a SIMPLE-ARRAY of characters in Lisp; the second one is called LEN, and is an integer. The function returns an integer value.

And now the Lisp side:

&lt;pre&gt;
(defun get-hostname ()
  (let* ((name (make-array 256 :element-type 'character))
	     (result (c-get-hostname name 256)))
    (if (zerop result)
	    (let ((pos (position #\null name)))
	      (subseq name 0 pos))
	  (error &quot;gethostname() failed.&quot;))))
&lt;/pre&gt;

This function creates the NAME array, calls C-GET-HOSTNAME to fill it and then checks the returned value. If the value is zero, then the call was successful, and we return the contents of NAME up to the first 0 character (the string terminator in C), otherwise we signal an error. Note that, unlike the previous example, we allocate the string in Lisp, and we rely on the Lisp garbage collector to get rid of it after the function terminates. Here is a usage example:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (get-hostname)
&quot;terminus&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Working with strings is, in general, easier than the previous example showed. Let's say you want to call getenv() from Lisp to access the value of an environment variable. getenv() takes a string argument (the variable name) and returns another string (the variable value). To be more precise, the argument is a pointer to a sequence of characters that should have been allocated by the caller, and the return value is a pointer to an already-existing sequence of chars (in the environment). Here is the definition of C-GETENV:

&lt;pre&gt;
(def-foreign-call (c-getenv &quot;getenv&quot;)
    ((var (* :char) string))
  :returning :int
  :strings-convert t)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The argument in this case is still a pointer to char in C, but we can declare it a STRING to Lisp. The return value is a pointer, so we declare it as integer. Finally, the :STRINGS-CONVERT keyword argument specifies that ACL should automatically translate the Lisp string passed as the first argument into a C string. Here is how it's used:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (c-getenv &quot;SHELL&quot;)
-1073742215
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are surprised by the return value, just remember that C-GETENV returns a pointer, and we must tell Lisp how to interpret the contents of the memory location pointed to by it. Since in this case we know that it will point to a C string, we can use the FF:NATIVE-TO-STRING function to convert it to a Lisp string:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (native-to-string (c-getenv &quot;SHELL&quot;))
&quot;/bin/tcsh&quot;
9
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

(The second and third values are the number of characters and bytes copied, respectively). One caveat: if you ask for the value of a non-existent variable, C-GETENV will return 0, and NATIVE-TO-STRING will fail. So a safer example would be:

&lt;pre&gt;
* (let ((ptr (c-getenv &quot;NOSUCHVAR&quot;)))
    (unless (zerop ptr)
      (native-to-string ptr)))
NIL
&lt;/pre&gt;

= St. George Defence/Three Pawns Attack =
This variation is the most aggressive White could play. By playing c4, White threatens either to build a very powerful center or to destroy Black's army at the queen side.

Black can react in various ways.

:[[/3...Bb7/]] ignores the threat and strikes at the center. It wouldn't be wise for White to trade a wing pawn against a center pawn. But now, White can defend with Nc3 as b4 would be answered with Qb3 (pinning the pawn).
:[[/3...b4/]] tries to keep the pressure at the queen side, letting White build his center. It's a very sharp variation for Black as White is going to have many weapons to attack both at the center and at the queen side, including moves as Qb3, d5, Nc3 and Bd2.
:[[/3...bxc4/]] isn't very logical, as Black abandons his queen-side power. He will have to fight back at the center despite White advance in development. In this case, it would have been better to play a classical Open Game (1...e5) or Sicilian (1...c5).

In this variation, defending with 4. Bd3 is bad, as 4...bxc4 wins a pawn. Instead, [[/4. Nc3/]] is perfect because 4...b4 can be answered with 5. Qb3. [[/4. Nd2/]] is also an interesting option. The knight blocks the bishop, but his defensive potential is increased as both the c-pawn and the e-pawn are protected.

features=Dwarf-like, appear where blood has been spilled|

== Overview ==

'''''Red Caps''''' are dwarf-like creatures that are found wherever blood has been spilled .

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In the Muggle world, we find the Red Cap in Scottish folklore. The Red Cap is a thoroughly evil creature. He is a short, stocky old man with long gray hair and claws instead of hands. He lives on the Scottish Border in ancient ruins of castles, especially in those with a bloody history of war and murder. He owes his name to the fact that he wears a red hat, which is colored by the blood of his victims. Red Cap moves with remarkable speed, despite the fact that he wears iron boots. He can overcome even the strongest man, unless the intended victim remembers to quote a few words from the bible. (Encyclopedia Mythica; thanks to Elizabeth Quest for the tip)

The Red Cap is introduced to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Remus Lupin|Professor Lupin]], then teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]], but while we hear the name in passing, we do not hear any description of it. We also hear it mentioned later when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] is telling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]], then filling in for an ill Lupin, what topics they have covered. Finally, a Red Cap is featured as part of the final Defence Against the Dark Arts exam, again without significant description.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book will teach you the basics and more advanced essentials of Windows Movie Maker. It assumes you have at least a simple knowledge of the Windows operating system.  

===Movie Maker's good and bad points===
====Pros====
*It's free
*Relatively easy to use compared to other editors

====Cons====
*It crashes quite often, sometimes forcing you to start over! 
*Pretty bad video quality
*Can't save huge movies you've edited

So basically, Movie Maker is good for you to get started with making films, but if you're going to get serious with making low-budget feature films, then you might want to buy a commercial program, which naturally yields better results.

My name is David Corper

I’ve got a question towards your students.

Is it possible to make water freeze by using a diamond disc created by ionizing carbon magnetically driven by two normal aa batteries ?

It could save the world

:Hi David

:(I'm not a student but a teacher: mind if I answer?)

:I'd be very surprised if the answer was anything other than 'No, sorry.' You'd have to give a whole lot more detail for anyone to give a definitive assesment but the vast majority of these desktop world-saving devices turn out to be bogus. See [[w:Cold fusion]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Windows movie maker can directly import video from a mini DV video camera. 

#Connect your video device. Mini DV video cameras can be connected using a FireWire cable. For more on connecting video devices (which usually means video cameras or webcams), see [[../Connecting a video device|Connecting video devices]].
#Under the TASKS tab, and under CAPTURE VIDEO, click on CAPTURE FROM VIDEO DEVICE. 
#This will bring up a wizard. Follow the instructions. When you choose your video settings, recommended is, well, recommended, because although the quality is fairy low, it takes up a minuscule amount of space. DV-AVI has the best possible quality, as it is uncompressed video. However, this means it takes up a lot of space, memory-wise. 
#Your video will now appear in the form of lots of thumbnails, in the COLLECTIONS space (the main, biggest space in the centre of the screen).

I believe in being bold, assuming good intentions, Featured Books, content, structure, Language Projects, and attempting neutrality. I am looking forward to contributing to wikibooks by organizing, splitting, moving, general spiffing up. In short, I like making small changes to produce better free books.

It should be noted that my bias leans &quot;left&quot; on most everything, and while I recognize and try to suppress this bias, it will inform my opinions, actions, edits and interests in ways both subtle and not so subtle.

White allows Black to take the pawn. Having played 7...Qb6, Black should take the pawn now with [[/8...Qxb2/]]. If Black radically changes plans and does not take the pawn, White will simply castle queenside (9. 0-0-0), protecting the pawn, and the Black queen will be out of place on b6, it would prefer to be on c7 where it doesn't obstruct the b-pawn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Webcams are commonly linked up through USB ports. 

==Mini DV==
Mini DV video cameras are linked up to computers via FireWire cables. These come in three varieties:
*4 pin/4 pin  [[File:FireWire cables.jpg|right|thumb|4 pin (left) and 6 pin (right) connectors]]
*4 pin/6 pin
*6 pin/6 pin

Cameras commonly have 4 pin sockets. Computers, however, commonly have 6 pin sockets and laptops sometimes have 4 pin or none!

A laptop with no FireWire ports but a PCMCIA card slot can use a PC card with 2 6-pin FireWire sockets. However, it is more convenient to connect it straight to the computer. [[File:Pcmcia-type-ii-and-iii.jpg|right|thumb|PCMCIA or PC cards]]

Click on the TASKS tab below HELP. Under CAPTURE VIDEO click on IMPORT AUDIO OR MUSIC.  &lt;br&gt;
Browse for your music or audio, and click IMPORT.

==Adding it to the video==
Simply drag and drop the thumbnail representing the audio onto the timeline. To move it around, drag it left and right along the timeline while the cursor is in the shape of a hand. You can split and set the volume for individual audio tracks, so if you want to have different parts of the audio louder or quieter you can split the audio into chunks and individually set the volume for each. You can shorten audio by grabbing the end of the audio on the timeline and dragging it when the cursor changes to two red arrows. You can make audio fade in or out, which is useful when it the audio is longer than your video otherwise the music wouldn't end gracefully. 

You can also set the volume for video clips' audio. Right click on the bars in the AUDIO row (the added audio/music's row is titled AUDIO/MUSIC).

=Petrov's Defence : Cochrane Gambit=
White attacks a bit too early. Black has an effective way to block the attack : [[/5...d5/]] (White cannot recapture the pawn without dropping a part of his offensive potential).

Other correct moves (but probably less effective) are [[/5...Ke8/]] and [[/5...Be6/]]. In these lines, White can weaken Black position even more.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Evolution of the City and its Forests==
During the hunter/gatherer phase of the development of man, there was no one place that was called home.  There was only a home range.  Trees were part of this range, providing fuel, tools and shelter.    When people learned to grow and harvest crops, there was no need to spend hours searching for the next meal.  It made sense to live near the fields and orchards.  The first permanent shelters were built.  We find that people sited these shelters on high points of land to maintain a lookout for danger, on the edge of a forest for shade and shelter from wind, and near water, a staple of life.  Does this description sound like a realtor's advertisement -- great view, wooded, lake front property.  As food production increased to a level that could support several families, villages formed, where people traded skills for the necessities of life.

These early villages were often built in a manner which shared walls.  This reduced the amount of building materials, mitigated some local temperature extremes and the narrow passageways between houses were easily defended.  [Kahun, Egypt][http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/kahun.htm] is an example of such a city.  You will notice that this design left little room for gardens and landscaping. 

The walls of the medieval city-states, provided protection for the homes, shops and other necessities that were crowded into them. Vegetation was removed for a distance around the cities so that attackers had less places to hide and fire upon the defenses.  This strategy worked well until the advent of gunpowder and long range weapons made the walls themselves obsolete.  As the photo in the [accompanying link][http://www.helios.gr/dis/rhodes/travel-guide/med_city.htm] point out this was the start of urban sprawl.

It was no longer beneficial to live in a crowded city that could easily be targeted by an enemy.  The more spread out people were, the better.  With this move to the &quot;suburbs&quot;, room became available for gardens and trees.  The communion with nature which had existed in the early days, was not available again.    

Cities such as Paris, France are good examples of this newer style city.  [Streets became wider, park and recreational areas appeared.][http://www.satimagingcorp.com/gallery/quickbird-paris-eiffel-lg.html]  This change was brought on for several reasons, besides just aesthetics.  The wide streets, laid out like spokes of a wheel allowed for rapid deployment of troops to any part of the city.  The promenades along the sides of the boulevards were the place for the Sunday driver, who wanted to slow down to better see the world and be seen, without tying up the through traffic of the city's commerce.  There are still people who think that the big city, sprawl and all, is a better idea than having the valuable open spaces of our land cut up into individual lots and hobby farms.  Their idea would be more closely modeled to part of Europe, where public lands are available for the people of the city just outside the city limits.  

As the world had become flattened and shrunk by technology and the interaction of nations, the ability of a person to work from any place that has a phone line has lead to people bringing their influence into more remote regions of our country.  Thomas L. Friedman in his book &quot;The World is Flat&quot;[http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/worldisflatexpanded.htm] documents the changes that have taken place over the past 50 years to level the playing field for all nations of the world.  It also points out ways in which the best is yet to come for the people who are adaptable, like the forests of the world have been for centuries.  The cities of the world are changing, the living habits of the population is changing and the challenges placed on all of our forests, by the people of the world, will change too.  

==Chicago:  A Case Study==

If we look at the development of the City of Chicago, through a selection of bibliographical materials collected by the Chicago Public Library[http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/chihist.html], we see how this development happened in an American city.  Following this description, we will look at what the various issues were that lead to its founding, placement and ultimate development into a large center of population and commerce. 

In 1673, the French explorers,Marquette and Joliet first explored the area that would later become the city of Chicago.  It was described as an area of swamps and streams.  The area was occupied at that time by various Indian tribes.  In 1696, Father Francois Pinet, a Jesuit missionary founded the Mission of the Guardian Angel on the site.  The mission was abandoned in 1700 when the missionary efforts proved fruitless.  

&quot;Little is known about the Chicago area from 1700 until about 1779 when the pioneer settler of Chicago, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, an African American from Sainte-Domingue (Haiti), built the first permanent settlement at the mouth of the river just east of the present Michigan Avenue Bridge on the north bank.&quot;

&quot;General Anthony Wayne had defeated the Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, and the ensuing treaty, concluded August 10, 1795, opened most of the present State of Ohio for settlement and named certain tracts in the Indian country to the westward to be used by the United States for forts and portages. One of these was described as 'one piece of land six miles square, at the mouth of the Chicago River, emptying into the southwest end of Lake Michigan.'&quot;

&quot;It was not until 1803 that the War Department ordered the construction of a fort at the mouth of the river. Troops arrived in the area on August 17 and began building shelters and a stockade. A year later, Fort Dearborn, named in honor of the Secretary of War, was completed.

For some years the garrison was peaceful and traders flourished. However, the outbreak of the War of 1812 with Great Britain moved the government to order the evacuation of the fort. The threatening attitude of the Indians led the entire population of the settlement to follow the garrison. After leaving the fort, the evacuees were attacked by Indians and many of the party were massacred and the fort was destroyed.   In 1816 the fort was rebuilt and was thereafter occupied by United States troops for twenty-one years. In 1837 it was abandoned but the fort stood until 1856.&quot; 

&quot;In 1829 the State Legislature appointed a commission to dig a canal connecting Chicago with the Mississippi River by way of the DesPlaines and Illinois rivers and to lay out towns, to sell lots, and to apply the proceeds to the construction of the canal. The canal commissioners employed James Thompson, a civil engineer, to lay out the original town.

&quot;On August 4, 1830, Thompson filed his survey and plat of the town of Chicago in Section 9, Township 39, Range 14, and thus Chicago received its first legal geographic location although the town was not incorporated until three years later.&quot;

&quot;On August 12, 1833, the Town of Chicago was incorporated with a population of 350. Incorporation was enabled by an act of the legislature, passed February 12, 1831, which provided that any community of over 150 inhabitants was authorized to incorporate as a town, with limits not to exceed one square mile in extent.&quot;

&quot; The name &quot;Chicago&quot; derived from the Indians but it is not known which tribe named the town and many theories have been advanced to explain the origin of the name. One generally accepted is that the name comes from the Indian words for either wild onion or skunk, but some historians believe that the word Chicago denoted 'strong' or 'great.'&quot; 

&quot;In 1822, by a grant from Congress, Illinois acquired the right of way across about one hundred miles of public lands from the head of Lake Michigan to LaSalle for canal purposes.

In 1827 Congress donated to the state a quantity of land &quot;equal to one-half of five sections in width (about ninety feet), on each side of the canal, reserving each alternate section to the United States from one end of the canal to the other.&quot; The state legislature passed the canal bill in 1823.

On July 4, 1836, ground was broken at Lockport and at Bridgeport and construction was finished in April, 1848, at an entire expense of $6,170,226. The city council of Chicago donated $2,500,000 in 1865 to deepen the canal to increase the current and dispose of city sewage. Deepening was completed in 1871 and after the great fire of that same year the state legislature refunded the money to the city.&quot;  The canal, the last great canal constructed in the US, ceased to be used in 1933.  Much of it lies under the current Stevenson Expressway.[http://www.chipublib.org/digital/sewers/canal.html]  

&quot;The first railroad constructed out of Chicago, the Galena and Chicago Union, was chartered January 16, 1836, to connect Chicago with the lead mines at Galena.&quot;  &quot; The railroad and the canal were vital in the development of Chicago and the population of the city tripled in the six years after the opening of the canal. Eventually other railroads were built and Chicago became the largest railroad center in the world.&quot;

&quot;Structures in early Chicago were built directly upon the swampy ground a few feet above the lake level. Neither cellars nor sewers were possible. Vehicles were constantly mired in the muddy and unhealthful streets.

In 1852 a Drainage Commission was incorporated by the legislature. The city council in 1855 and 1856 adopted resolutions ordering that the grades throughout the city be raised to a height which would insure proper drainage. The new grade ordered the street levels and buildings lifted bodily to heights varying from four feet to seven feet above the low water level of the river as adopted by canal trustees in 1847. For street grading, mud and sand from the river bed, as well as any other materials that could be had, were used and the streets began to rise above the level of the country like levees along a river.

George M. Pullman, who had solved similar problems along the Erie Canal, engineered much of the lifting of early Chicago buildings. Buildings were jacked up and a foundation built under them without interrupting the occupancy of the building. By 1858 the city had succeeded in raising itself out of the mud. Early paving on the newly raised streets consisted first of planking; later macadam, wooden blocks, and paving stones were used.&quot;

&quot; The Plan of Chicago was a work formally undertaken by the Merchants Club in 1906 and continued by the merged Commercial and Merchants Clubs, known as the Commercial Club of Chicago.

The Plan of Chicago proposed the moral up-building and physical beautification of Chicago, which included better living conditions for all people, reclaiming the lake front for the public, increasing the park areas and public playgrounds, and a scientific development of the arteries between the different sections of the city.&quot; &quot; Daniel Hudson Burnham, world renowned architect and resident of Chicago, took charge of the details of the plan.&quot;  &quot;...the public accepted Burnham's proposals for the reclamation of the lake front and park lands, the creation of the green belt of forest preserves, and the straightening of the Chicago River.&quot;

In 1900, the Sanitary and Ship canal was completed to reverse the flow of the Chicago river and carry sewage to the Illinois river rather than Lake Michigan.  This was the first of several canals constructed for this purpose.[http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/timeline/riverflow.html] 

The above information contains quotes from a Chicago Public Library website.[http://www.chipublib.org/004chicago/chihist.html]   

Looking back at this information on the development of Chicago, what do you notice as trends that lead to its current makeup?  How did things like location, transportation, and commerce affect both Chicago and your hometown?  What do you know about the town that you grew up in or are currently working in?  How was it named?  Who founded it?  Why is it where it is?  How do these factors affect our attitudes toward the city and nature?  We will find that each of these questions will play a part in the formulation of your urban forestry management plan in the future.

* Two questions. Give them thought.
*# The meltdown in Iraq ended? When?
*# What is the scope? A political textbook? A religious textbook? An economic textbook? An epistemoligcal textbook?
*# Who is the audience? High school? Undergraduate students? Someone else?
* (That was actually three questions. :) Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 02:02, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

I have to say that history of the Middle East is not in 1910s to now, it actually came back to the Crusades where Saladin and the Christian Crusades began battling over the control of Jerusalem and the Middle East. [[User:Rakuten06|Rakuten06]] 20:34, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

: Yeah; but a Wikibook on the Middle East from 1900-2007 should not include the Crusades :-p --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 10:41, 25 December 2006 (UTC)

*Sounds like an excellent suggestion for a Wikibook. Can I suggest something that I've noticed about some of the Wikibooks regarding history: that instead of merely duplicating and lengthening what could already be found on Wikipedia, it might be excellent to include  source documents, both primary and secondary (not sure quite how to obtain these and use them under Wiki license) as well as including questions and analysis...Good luck and if you need any help don't hesitate to ask!

LaTeX is a turing complete typesetting language built on top of the TeX typesetting language by Knuth. If I were to go make a pdf, I'd try LaTeX first... When I am no longer lazy of course.

[[w:LaTeX]]
[http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~berland/latex/docs/listings.pdf Listings], a pretty printer package for programming languages -&gt; LaTeX. That document shows what LaTeX can output... in its default. Personally, I hate the default LaTeX spits out, so I '''will''' change it if I make a pdf for a wikibook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">;Rectangular:
The rectangular sleeping bag is probably the most common, and are popular for light use.  They are not suitable for backpacking because they provide the least amount of warmth and the most amount of weight.  As the name implies, they are rectangle-shaped.  While this makes them comfortable and roomy, the wide opening near the top is a major source of heat loss.  Unlike a mummy bag it does not have a hood that can be drawn around the head to retain heat.

;Mummy Bag:
The mummy bag is shaped like a sarcophagus.  It is narrow at the feet (but tall there to allow just enough room for the feet), tapers at the waist, widens again at the shoulders, and then tapers down near the head.  The top is very much like the hood of a winter coat, complete with drawstrings to close up the gap and keep heat in.  Because they conform so well to the human shape, there is very little wasted space inside.  This is good because your body has to heat all that space, and because the extra insulation and material thusly removed does not have to be carried (meaning it's lighter).

;Barrel Bag:
The barrel bag is a modified mummy bag.  It is roomier than the mummy bag and provides almost the same warmth at the cost of additional weight.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Smiley.svg|150px|right]]'''Positive psychology''' is the scientific study of optimal human functioning. The history of psychology as a science shows that the field has been primarily dedicated to addressing mental illness rather than mental wellness. Its research programs and application models have dealt mainly with how people are impaired rather than how they thrive. Rather than detail mental illness and late interventions. This textbook aims to describe the scientific study of the psychology of people in good mental health.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sleeping pads can perform two main functions:
# Provide cushioning
# Provide insulation between the sleeper and the ground.

;Air mattresses:
Air mattresses are inflatable cushions that can provide a lot of comfort when it comes to sleeping on the ground.  Unfortunately, they are not very warm as they provide next to no insulation beneath the sleeper.  This may not be an issue, though it is well worth knowing.

;Open-cell foam pads:
Open-cell foam is a type of foam padding that is sometimes found in furniture cushions or even in regular mattresses.  It is lightweight - though somewhat bulky.  Its chief disadvantage is that it soaks up water like a sponge.

;Closed-cell foam pads:
Closed-cell foam makes the ideal sleeping pad.  The closed cells do not soak up water.  They are lightweight, comfortable, and compact.  Often they are only half an inch (12 mm) thick, so they can be rolled into a small tube and strapped to a backpack.  They also serve as an excellent thermal barrier between the sleeper and the ground.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As noted in [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Corporation tax/Who pays corporation tax?|''Who pays corporation tax?'']], UK resident companies pay corporation tax on their worldwide profits, whereas, non-residents are only within the charge to corporation tax if they carry on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment, and then, only on the profits attributable to that permanent establishment.

These means we need to consider the following:

*How do we decide if a company is UK resident?
*What is a permanent establishment?
*How do we attribute proits to that permanent establishment?

==Residency==

A company is resident in the United Kingdom if:

*it is incorporated in the UK&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 66 of the Finance Act 1988|Section 66 of the Finance Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;; or
*it has its central management and control in the UK.

It is possible for a company to be both UK resident plus meet the residency requirements of another jurisdiction. Often there is a double tax convention between the UK and that other jurisdiction that has a residency clause&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 249 of the Finance Act 1994|Section 249 of the Finance Act 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;. This clause typically provides that if a company is resident under the law of both contracting states, it shall be deemed to be resident only in the state where the company is effective managed. Generally the terms &quot;effective management&quot; and &quot;central management and control&quot; are synonymous. If there is no double tax convention, the company will continue to be taxed as a resident of both jurisdictions.

==Permanent establishment==

A company has a permanent establishment in a territory if, and only if&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 148 of the Finance Act 2003|Section 148 of the Finance Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;:
  
*it has a fixed place of business there through which the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on, or 
*an agent acting on behalf of the company has and habitually exercises there authority to do business on behalf of the company. 

For this purpose a &quot;fixed place of business&quot; includes: 
  
*a place of management; 
*a branch; 
*an office; 
*a factory; 
*a workshop; 
*an installation or structure for the exploration of natural resources; 
*a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources; 
*a building site or construction or installation project. 

A company is not regarded as having a permanent establishment in a territory by reason of the fact that it carries on business there through an agent of independent status acting in the ordinary course of his business. Also, a company is not regarded as having a permanent establishment in a territory by reason of the fact that:
  
*a fixed place of business is maintained there for the purpose of carrying on activities for the company, or 
*an agent carries on activities there for and on behalf of the company, 

if, in relation to the business of the company as a whole, the activities carried on are only of a preparatory or auxiliary character, which is taken to include:  

*the use of facilities for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the company; 
*the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the company for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; 
*the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the company for the purpose of processing by another person; 
*purchasing goods or merchandise, or collecting information, for the company.

==Attributing profits to a permanent establishment==

The profits attributable to a permanent establishment for the purposes of corporation tax are&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 11 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 11 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;:
  
*trading income arising directly or indirectly through or from the establishment, 
*income from property or rights used by, or held by or for, the establishment, and 
*chargeable gains as described below.

For tax purposes, the profits attributed to the permanent establishment are the profits it would have made if it were a distinct and separate enterprise, engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, dealing wholly independently with the non-resident company.&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 11AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 11AA of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
It is assumed for these purposes that the permanent establishment has the same credit rating as the non-resident company, and has such equity and loan capital as it could reasonably be expected to have if it were a distinct and separate enterprise. Tax deductions cannot exceed the amount of the costs that would have been incurred on this assumption, except that there are deductions for allowable expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. &quot;Allowable expenses&quot; means expenses of a kind in respect of which a deduction would be allowed for corporation tax purposes if incurred by a company resident in the United Kingdom.
 
The chargeable gains of a company not resident in the United Kingdom but carrying on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment there include chargeable gains accruing to the company on the disposal of&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 10B of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992|Section 10B of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;: 
  
*assets situated in the United Kingdom and used in or for the purposes of the trade at or before the time the gain accrued, or 
*assets situated in the United Kingdom and used or held for the purposes of the permanent establishment at or before the time the gain accrued or acquired for use by or for the purposes of the permanent establishment. 

For this rule to apply, the disposal has to be made at a time when the company is carrying on a trade in the UK through a permanent establishment there.

There are special rules for attributing profits to non-resident banks, brokers, financial intermediaries and insurers.

I am an '''Admin''' - if you want '''help''' I'll do want I can, if you are a '''vandal''' you will may well be blocked without warning.  I also tend to delete things quite quickly, if you disagree with me tell me - I will listen to you and try and reach a solution. As an Admin I take full responsibility for my actions.

I have an interest in three other accounts on this Wiki.  [[User:Herbys bot]] is my bot account for cleanup and maintainance task (ask me if you have a job to do).  I am part of [[User:The Staff]] account.  There is also another one that merely redirects here relating to a previous Wikipedia account.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To reduce vulnerability to negative emotions remember the acronym:

PLEASE Mastery

PL stands for physical illness.  When you are healthy and strong you're less likely to be an emotion mind.

E stands for eating.  Eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of water.

A stands for abstain from alcohol and drugs.  alcohol and drugs are mood destabilizing.

S stands for sleep.  Give yourself plenty of time to sleep.  Everything goes better when you're rested.

E stands for exercise.  Worked up to 20 minutes of vigorous exercise a day.

Master stands for mastery.  Mastery is doing something that make you feel competent and in control.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Jane’s self-validating feelings''' 

Jane (not a real person) is a teenager living with her parents, who does not do well with stress. She is doing the best she can, but when she is put under pressure she gets nervous.  She is fine most of the time unless there is a deadline of some kind.  With any sort of time limit, she feels overwhelmed, anxious, and confused. When there is time pressure, Jane starts to ruminate; she becomes forgetful, irritable with others, and tends to isolate.  Jane’s reaction to stress causes problems in school, work and home.  

Jane’s family assumes that she is she stable person she appears to be.  They do not understand that she can get so anxious and upset with pressure.  In fact, Jane works hard to stay in control and avoid pressure.  Sometimes, her family puts what they this is normal pressure on her to do something and Jane “freaks out” as she angrily pushes people away.  take her unstable mood into consideration, sometimes they expect more out of her than she can give at the time. She is expected to do what her family asks despite her problem with anxiety  – how she feels or what she thinks. Jane’s private experiences (feelings, thoughts, moods, fears) are not appreciated. 

Her family believes the problem is her motivation.  They believe if she would try harder she could do what they expect of her. “You could do it if you wanted to.” Her family is emotionally invalidating because they do not consider her personal experience or appreciate her emotional and mental experience.  Jane can not consistently live up to their expectations and thinks she has disappointed “everyone.” Instead of feeling proud of what she has done, she feels guilt and shame for not pleasing her family and her occasional nervous breakdown. 

One way for Jane to have her feelings taken seriously is to increase the intensity of her expressed emotions. “I can’t do it!” she screams. As her behavior becomes more frantic and desperate (mood-dependent), the intensity of her emotional expressions increase, she finally gets her family’s attention and sympathy. Unfortunately, when she is so out of control, she is not able to be really persuasive and get them to understand. She is expressive but not logical. Rather, when expressing such intense emotion, others perceive her as being “manipulative” (by which most people mean that she is using emotion to get them to do something) and they resent feeling controlled by her. 

When she has calmed down and has a good day, Jane demonstrates normal behavior. She does what her family says she “should” do.  Then her family believes that she really could do what they expected her to do all along. “See you can do it. We knew you could do it if you tried.” They believe her behavior depends on her motivation. So she feels guilt and shame (instead of pride of accomplishment) because she “should” have been behaving like this all along. Because she demonstrated normal behavior, the high expectations kick in again and the all-or-nothing thinking. She is criticized for not living up to their expectations. Jane again feels misunderstood and invalidated. 

Jane lives with the shame of not being good enough to live up to her parent’s expectations. Her feelings of depression and sadness naturally follow from her thoughts. Her feelings are self-validating because she feels as she believes. She has internalized the messages she has gotten from the invalidating environment and has based her interpretation of her behavior on her family’s assessment. She feels sad because she believes she’s not good enough and she believes she’s not good enough because she has repeatedly disappointed her family.  The function of her depressed feelings is self-validating: she thinks about herself the way that she feels about herself and feels about herself the way she thinks about herself. Her feelings determine her thoughts and vice versa.

is [[Self-validating feelings]] intended to be a sub page of a book?  If so it should be moved to be a subpage of that book.  If it is intended as a stand alone book that is different - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:09, 24 December 2006 (UTC)
:please bear in mind with this that Wikibooks does not include works of fiction (you do refer to it as a &quot;story&quot;?).  Let me know if I can help --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:17, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

yes, self validating feelings is a sub page of the function of emotions and is an illustrative story.  Also, I'm not sure how I am supposed to respond to you.  Thank you for fixing the page I will check it out.</text>

&lt;small&gt;The material below is directly taken from the DSM-IV or the DSM-IV-TR and summarized for clarity. The material excludes the specific diagnostic texts, case summaries, and extended text of the entry, and is as short as possible. The DSM-IV is widely quoted and cited in this manner, and this usage falls under [[WB:FUP|fair use]].&lt;/small&gt; 
----
This Paraphilia is characterized by sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors involving observing an unknowing and non-consenting person, usually unclothed and/or engaged in sexual activity, to produce sexual excitement.

'''Diagnostic criteria for 302.82 Voyeurism ''' 

''A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving the act of observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity.'' 

''B. The person has acted on these urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.''

'''Etiology'''

There are different theories regarding this behavior. There is no one proven etiological cause.

'''Treatment'''

Treatment involves psychotherapy aimed at uncovering and working through the underlying cause of the behavior.

'''Prognosis'''

Prognosis is good although often there are other issues which may surface once the behaviors are extinguished. If this is the case, these issues must be worked through as well


----
&lt;small&gt;The material cited above comes from the DSM-IV-TR, ©1995-2006, American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. The full text of the DSM-IV includes associated features, diagnostic tools based on culture, age, and gender features, prevalence, course, and familial pattern of mental disorders. It also covers diagnosis, treatment, and quality of care. The above cited material is a summary of a DSM-IV or DSM-IV-TR entry and should not be used for diagnostic purposes. The full text can be purchased [http://www.appi.org/book.cfm?id=2024 here].
&lt;/div&gt;

The DSM-IV has a rather broad definition of voyeurism that it recognizes as clinical in nature.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Flatbread|Flatbread]]

'''Pancakes''' are a type of [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] prepared from a [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]] that is baked on a hot griddle or frying pan.  They exist in several variations in many different local [[Cookbook:Cuisine|cuisine]]s.  Most pancakes are quick breads, although some are also made using a [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]-raised or fermented batter.  Here are some basic pancake recipes.

Note: These recipes are all for the American and Scottish style of risen pancakes. For the English and French style of flat pancake (made without baking powder) see [[Cookbook:Crêpe]].

==Pancakes from Scratch==
===Ingredients===
*1 cup (120 grams) all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (white, whole grain or 1:1 mix of white and whole grain)
*1½ teaspoon [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*1 pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 cup (250 ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (substitute buttermilk or 1:1 mix of milk and buttermilk)
*1 [[Cookbook:Eggs|egg]], [[Cookbook:Separate|separated]]
*1 Tbs [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]] (Optional: this will add a sweetness to your pancakes and is recommended if you are not using any sauces, syrups or ingredient such as bananas or blueberries that will add natural sugars to the mix).

===Procedure===
#In large bowl, mix dry ingredients together until well-blended.
#Add milk and mix well until smooth.
#[[Cookbook:Separate|Separate]] eggs, placing the whites in a medium bowl and the yolks in the batter. Mix well.
#[[Cookbook:Beat|Beat]] whites until stiff and then [[Cookbook:Fold|fold]] into batter gently (skip this step for heavier pancakes or if 1 cup buttermilk is substituted for milk).
#Pour ladles of the mixture into a non-stick pan, one at a time.
#Cook until the edges are dry and bubbles appear on surface.  Turn; cook until golden.  Yields 12 to 14 pancakes.

===Notes, tips, and variations===
# Serve with butter, maple syrup, fruit, chocolate spread, melted chocolate, jam or cheese.
# Many variations of this recipe use a [[Cookbook:Beaten egg|beaten egg]].  In these variations most commonly all wet ingredients are mixed together with the dry ingredients in step 2, and you then proceed to step 5.
# Use [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] or yogurt instead of milk, or wholegrain flours instead of white.  This will change the consistency of the final product (i.e. whole grain flours generally lead to a denser heavier pancake, so try mixing white and wheat in various proportions as suggested above to get the feel you want).  
# Add sliced fruit such as [[Cookbook:Banana|banana]] and [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]], or broken crispy bacon to the batter after pouring into the skillet and before flipping.

==Banana-Spirulina Pancakes (Vegan)==
This is a recipe for '''Banana-Spirulina Pancakes''' that makes about 5-6 large pancakes (serves two people well).

===Materials===

*1¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (check that label!)
*2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*About 1 teaspoon powdered [[Cookbook:Spirulina|spirulina]] (optional, but recommended)
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|vegetable oil]]
*1¼ cup rice milk ([[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy]] might also work)
*1 thinly sliced [[Cookbook:Banana|Banana]] (if you freeze the banana first, you can get very thin slices)
*non-stick [[cookbook:skillet|skillet]], [[Cookbook:sauté pan|sauté pan]], or [[cookbook:griddle|griddle]]
*[[Cookbook:Spatula|Spatula]]
*[[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|Maple syrup]]
*non-stick spray

===Steps===
Sift and mix flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and spirulina in a big bowl.
# In a separate bowl, mix oil and milk.
# Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients.
# Dump in the liquid ingredients and lightly mix the two together.
# Do not whisk, beat, or otherwise try to mash out all of the batter lumps. You will end up with tough, flat, and ugly pancakes. Keep a light hand, and your pancakes will remember by yielding fluffy results.
# Gently toss in the bananas and stir them just to coat in the batter.
# Heat up the non-stick pan and spray evenly with oil.
# Using a 1/3 cup measure as a scoop, dip into the batter and pour evenly into the [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]]. Watch your heat carefully, you want it on medium-hot (don't burn them).
# When bubbles begin to form in the middle of the pancake, and the edges look somewhat set, give it another spray of oil.
# Immediately, flip over.
# Cook for another minute or so, then remove the pancake, and put it in the toaster oven on warm (Or find some way of keeping it warm while you finish off the batter).
# Spray the pan again, and repeat until the batter is all gone.

===Serving Tips===

# A light maple syrup is very good. Some prefer this without anything else.
# Strawberry jam is also preferable, as it gives it that sour zing.
# Nutella Ferrero is very good, for those who like chocolate.
# Sugar powder for those who have a sweet tooth.

Something that starts &quot;2 cups original Bisquick mix&quot; is not a recipe, it's directions. You can't start a recipe on pancakes with &quot;Open a box of pancake mix.&quot;
:Actually, it ''is'' a recipe.  It's a simple one from Bisquick.  Bisquick already premixed some of the ingredients; that's all. [[User:Marcus2|Marcus2]] 18:24, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

What the hell is an &quot;Original Bisquick mix&quot;? I agree with the first poster that the recipe should have real ingredients, not some brand-specific products which might not even be available outside a given area. --[[User:163.1.42.166|163.1.42.166]] 11:32, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

== I agree ==

I agree. if someone doesn't want to go to the bother of making pancakes yourself, and buys a mix, then the directions are on the box, therefore i think the section is obsolete. Please comment, and if noone comments ill delete it.
[[User:Mcmillan0520|Mcmillan0520]] 21:01, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

== 12 - 14 pancakes my foot. ==

It's looking like I'm going to have 4 pancakes from this mix so far.  Maybe 6 if I'm lucky.  Am I the only one?

== 12 - 14 pancakes depends on your ingredients. ==
Some flours give you denser taller pancakes (oat flour) while others (white flour) will give flatter pancake.  I used the recipe doubled with oat flour and ended up with ca. 15.  Egg size will also change the yield somewhat.

== 12-14 pancakes if you make them really small ==
Using white and wheat flour, when I make the pancakes about six inches in diameter I have enough batter for at least six whole pancakes, and they come out pretty thick. I'm sure some people must make them smaller. If you're getting less than six pancakes from the current recipe you must be going full Uncle Buck on them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think that the assertion that SQL is &quot;a method for specifying the means of requesting data...&quot; is convoluted and incorrect.  SQL isn't a method: it's a language.  SQL also doesn't specify the ''means'', or how to accomplish the task  Rather, it specifies the ''ends'': the desired or expected result of the operation.  I added a more descriptive definition of SQL as a declarative language to further clarify this point.

I also removed the paragraph that incorrectly stated that SQL is ''non-programmable''.  Of course SQL is programmable, since it is after all a database programming language.  I think the original author may have confused this term with ''non-procedural'', which has quite a different meaning.  In any case, I added a reference to the characteristics of procedural database languages to further clarify how the contrast between SQL as a declarative language.  Further expansion of this topic could be useful to show the steps to perform a query using dBase/xBase code vs. SQL.

I also think the term ''metadata'' shouldn't be used without a definition or reference to its meaning, since it isn't a term that readers should be expected to know.

:I'm sure very relevant and important but this should be placed on the talk page of the article concerned - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:45, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why save it like this?==
The normal save you use (on the file menu) saves your work in Windows Movie Maker format, which cannot be uploaded to the internet, played in media players or burned to discs. So you must click on SAVE TO MY COMPUTER to save it in on of the 'proper' formats, such as WMV (Windows Media Video). 

==Saving it==
#If the movie tasks are not displayed (at the far left of the screen) then click on the TASKS tab below HELP.
#Under FINISH MOVIE, click on SAVE TO MY COMPUTER.
#Follow the instructions in the wizard. When selecting your format, take these things into consideration: if you transferred your video to your computer DV-AVI or wish to burn the finished video to DVD, then choose DV-AVI. If you captured your video and save it in DV-AVI the quality will be just as it was before you started - uncompressed. Otherwise, just choose RECOMMENDED.
#Er, that's it.

===Note=== 
If your video size exceeds your computer's available RAM, it will not save and the time estimate will be ridiculously large. Eventually the computer will give up and display a message about Virtual Memory being too low. An example of one of movie maker's many shortcomings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Implementation of unix command line calendar.


== Syntax ==
''cal [month] [year]''


== Examples ==
*'''cal''' - prints calendar for current month
*'''cal -3''' - prints out a  3 months (previous, current and next)
*'''cal -1''' - prints current month (some implementations defaults to printing three months)
*'''cal 12 2006''' - prints out calendar for December 2006
*'''cal 2006''' - prints out calendar for the whole year 2006
*'''cal -s''' - set Sunday as a first day of week
*'''cal -m''' - set Monday as a first day of week
*'''cal -j''' - show the day-numbers (starting with January 1st as #1) of this month

== Triva ==
In September 1752, England finally switched to the Gregorian-calendar (about 100 years later than the rest of Europe).  As Unix was developed in &quot;The Colonies&quot;, traces of this change can still be found in '''cal'''... try: 
*'''cal 9 1752'''

| use = In early spring, the '''shoots and stalks''' can be pulled up and eaten raw or boiled for 15 minutes.  In late spring, the spikes can be gathered just before they break out of their papery sheaths, boiled for a few minutes, buttered, and eaten like corn-on-the-cob.  In early summer, the spikes produce large quantities of pollen which can be gathered by covering the top of the plant with a paper bag, inverting it, and shaking vigorously.  The pollen can be used as '''flour''' when mixed half and half with wheat flour.  In fall and winter, the roots can be gathered.  Wash them and then soak them in a bucket of water.  While still submerged, crush them to remove the fibrous covering.  Then let the starchy portion of the root settle to the bottom.  Skim off the fiber, strain out the water, and use as flour.

== Freedoms, editorial control and copyright ownership ==
The original text did have all this factors included as to make the distinction on what ownership meant in the specific contexts, recently people have focused more on establishing that no one has editorial control on works (I think that it is consensual and already expressed on other policies texts, probably not as emphatically as some would wish). The proposal draft was and is seen as necessary to clarify contributing Wikibookians about copyright issues, our new [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use Terms of Use] (July 2009) makes a real improvement on what was originally available at the time the proposal was first drafted, but it is still specific on establishing users and Wikimedia, responsibilities, requirements and freedoms, not in establishing or clarifying authorship/copyright rights, attributions, requirements and limitations. Some of these are very specific to the Wikibooks project and ultimately will require our community approval.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:02, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

:I very much liked Darklama's [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Ownership&amp;oldid=1985145 previous version].  I would like to suggest we revert back to this version and move forward from there. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 00:08, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

::I have proposed to Darklama to include that statements in the Be Bold that already deals with the problem of editorial control (if you have the time read the discussion that lead to the adoption of the Be Bold text). I do not, and don't know of anyone today that opposing the views that Darklama condensed on that edit, I even don't object to have it included on this draft, but the point of the text is about copyright ownership not editorial control. See this talk page history for more information.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:43, 2 December 2010 (UTC)   

::: I have read through the history diff by diff.  My conclusion is that, of the people that have taken part in the talk page you are the unique person claiming that this page is about copyright.

::: Granted, there was much discussion of copyright in the history in response to points you have raised.  But everyone else seemed to be clear that this was not what the page was about.

::: But it was pointed out many times by Whiteknight [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Ownership&amp;diff=696983&amp;oldid=696127], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Ownership&amp;diff=697972&amp;oldid=697969], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Ownership&amp;diff=712554&amp;oldid=712258], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Ownership&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=828657]. By SB_Johnny [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Ownership&amp;diff=698427&amp;oldid=698423], and Darklama [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks_talk:Ownership&amp;diff=700543&amp;oldid=700115].  The other participants Robert Horning and Jguk never explicitly state one way or another what the page should be about.  

::: Overall, I agree with the sentiments above that this page has ''nothing'' to do with copyright.  And seeing that others feel the same I am going to be bold and go back to DL's version. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 04:41, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

::Our specific requirements of attribution (not the same as Wikipedia), definition of author, the author page, the benefits of having stated licensing of the works. I know your opinion, by our previous discussions that you see little point on this issues but I ask you to respect mine and others that also have stated opposition to your sole satisfaction with the submit statement, to what we previously discussed and pointed limitation. IIRC the last issue on that front was on the volatility of the statement and the lack of discussion regarding it's changes. Note that I'm not promoting a discussion on these subjects now only attempting to remind you of past discussions about the subject of copyright in general, that you seem to have forgotten.
::The information present here is not irrelevant and is not duplicated elsewhere, it can be easily extended to clarify our dual licensing scheme that to most users should be confusing and enable a future discussion regarding relicensing of works beyond the Wikibooks licenses among other issues relevant only to copyright owners. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:43, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

::: The definition of an author is no different here than anywhere else. While there are author pages the need for them is even less now than before. People are no longer obligated to refer to the authors to give credit when reusing book material and can instead just link back. I'm not sure what the current status is on stating licensing of works, I have noticed some Licensing pages have been deleted over time. I see even less point on these issues now than I did back than because of CC-BY-SA and a link back being sufficient attribution. I believe there isn't a need to clarify the licensing scheme because people don't need to use the GFDL license at all unless they want to.
::: I believe it would be a good idea to find out from Whiteknight what his intentions were and if necessary rename this page to &quot;Wikibooks:Copyright_ownership&quot; to avoid continued ambiguity. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:04, 2 December 2010 (UTC)
::: Actually there isn't any need to ask Whiteknight, unless you are still confused on his intentions for this proposal. He has stated it many times [[Wikibooks talk:Ownership/Archive 1#Fixes and Copyright Stuff|including his last comments from 2007]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:13, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

::::Yes and no. Due to the nomenclature used by the software the word author has been extremely abused, we had already discussed this issues, but I'm game to rehash the subject again if you fell it is important at this time. An editor is not an author for instance the C++ Programming book has (according to [http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/EN/Wikibooks_EN.htm#13 stats.wikimedia.org])166 registered '''authors'''.
::::I fact it has 166 editors, this is a non issue on Wikipedia (since there is no ownership over each encyclopedic article is not possible, only the over the aggregation). As I often stated Wikibooks is completely different in this respect, the closest project to us on copyrights procedure and overall structure is Wikisource. In any case you already know all these arguments I do fail to realize your purpose in failing to acknowledge already established positions. 
::::The current status on stating the licensing of the works was achieved in a discussion that we had on Rob's talk page IIRC, it was determined that even if it was beneficial to clearly state the licensing on each individual work and the people that specifically own rights over them (as to permit among other things future license changes). That there was not a consensus on the best implementation, required verifiability of identity and that ownership must be claimed by contributors (not attributed, attributions are only necessary if using other works, per the licenses). The community also discussed the particular problem regarding print versions and in general the generation of stand alone copies of the works, as requiring the inclusion of  the GFDL, at the time the only license (one of the particular issues we, me and you, clashed on). Today it is debatable if only the simple acknowledgment of CC-BY-SA suffices, this is the specific reason why in the works I participate as an author I clearly state adhesion only to the CC-BY-SA license (the GFDL will only be valid on the aggregation, under the submit statement concept).
::::I have a good memory of the past events, this specific draft was  created in response to the claims being attributed to me about editorial control and the confusion regarding the point I was making about copyright ownership, Whiteknight created this page during one of the times I was blocked, discussion that lead directly to the 27 February 2007 RfD of the C++ book.
::::In any case I don't think that discussion of this draft is particular important and going anywhere at this moment, as we are only restating previously known positions, most of the subject is not consensual and now sadly the consensual part has been removed under my objections. I will finish this discussion with a post stating my objections to the changes and basis for them.  
::::I'm certainly more interested on your view of the fair use of images and how you came to that position on the request for permission and in having that request addressed...
::::PS:Of note that the phrase &quot;''I believe there isn't a need to clarify the licensing scheme because people don't need to use the GFDL license at all unless they want to.''&quot; doesn't have any value, it contradicts itself, it is equal to the statement &quot;I believe that there is a need to clarify the licensing scheme if people want to use the GFDL license, even if people don't need to.&quot;, making it a failed argument.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 15:52, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

I will just chime in and say that I have to agree with Darklama's comment on his talk page that [[wmf:Terms of Use]] and [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] cover copyrights and licensing.  I've always thought of this page in the behavioral sense of owning books, though I admit I hadn't given it a good read.  However, I like what I've seen so far in terms of changes made to bring it to the current state. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 03:33, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

== Statement of objection ==
I'm hereby making a statement of objection against recent changes to the draft, done under objection by myself above in 1 Dec 2010, as a clear bypassing of the normal process to archive consensus and a clear disregard and nullification of the discussion attempt that was taking place.&lt;br&gt;
My objection is based on the intrinsic change to the draft text, that was focused in copyright issues to the issue of editorial control, this draft had a significant historical importance since it reflected a difficult process to get consensus in a subject that is extremely controversial, these changes put all references to the draft out of context (see [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Wikibooks:Ownership]]) and disregard past Wikibookians work on it. Of note that I don't object to the statement about the editorial control but what started as a clarification was now made into the sole and primary content.&lt;br&gt;
The draft I support is the one from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Ownership&amp;oldid=1908787 the edit by Adrignola, 9 August 2010] with the necessary updates (to reflect the CC-SA licenses ), reflected in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Ownership&amp;oldid=1985236 the edit by Panic2k4, 1 December 2010]  (any other similar update would be valid).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:13, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

:Well I would like to address the objections raised as best I can.  I was not of the opinion I was bypassing of the normal process.  I had read the page history as you suggested, and came to the conclusion that myself, Darklama, and the editors I linked above (Whiteknight, SB_Johnny) felt this was a page about editorial control.  The only editor that seemed to be advocating for this to be about copyright that I saw in the history was you.  

:Given that the latest version began &quot;This text is about copyright ownership, licensing, responsibility and requirements, not about editorial control.&quot; I felt this version of the text missed represented the consensus.  My intention was to go back to something a few of us agreed upon and imporve it from there.  Overall I don't feel there has been any real shift in the focus of the text.  No work has been thrown away, this text is largly based on what had been there before.  It is just that I had a new interest in revisiting this proposed policy and see if it is possible to shape it into a full fledged policy.

:From reading of the talk page history the consensus seemed to be that copyright concerns deserve their own page, and they were given their own page ([WB:Copyrights]]).  Is their an issue that the terms of use and copyrights pages fail to cover? What do you think is missing from the current set of policies that need further explanation?that you feel should be made clear here? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 07:27, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

::The revision changes I objected above regards [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AOwnership&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1985795&amp;oldid=1985236 this reposition you made]. I have no particular interest beyond establishing consensus in the a community interpretation of the copyright law and licenses that affect us here and our creations outside of the project. There are extremely divergent views on these subjects of core importance, in any case I wasn't the creator of this draft, even if I and others did participate in writing it my motivation was to get those points established and visible to other contributors. My feelings is due to the work/time and discussions done on that regard to bring it to that state that will be as good as lost.
::I note again the sequence of actions and not only on this page. In your position after seeing that I already had contacted the Wikibookian about my position and objection to the change explaining why, I would have participated with my opinion on the ongoing discussion until I had a felling for the issue.
::I wouldn't have performed a reversal but considering that I would, I would have been impartial and reverted both changes, but I wouldn't execute a reversal against one of the persons having a dispute, especially considering that the two persons already had a checkered past in dealing exactly with this subject matter.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:24, 3 December 2010 (UTC) 

::: Your feedback is very welcome, and something I will think about.  Sometimes I make mistakes, and it could be that decision was one of them.  But where do we go from here? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:33, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

:::: Just reminding you that actions do accumulate and resonate, when using the written word perceptions is everything and memory is long. At this point we are mostly finished on this subject since by your own fulminating action you have decided against my position, in fact as I like to say, you ignored my right to block, and acted on a majority decision that you support, we can even say that you did exactly what the draft text attempts to prevent, you exerted unilateral editorial control over the text, that is the only result of an edit reversal...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:48, 3 December 2010 (UTC)    

::::: These are very strong words (I had to look up fulminating, and… wow, that is a strong description of my actions).  I really don't intend to decide against your position.  I simply felt the version you put forward did not reflect the consensus of the other editors on the page.  I have never held consensus needed to be unanimous.  So concepts like a &quot;right to block&quot; simply never entered my mind.  I have been on the wrong side of consensus many times and never had (nor wanted) to block a community decision by my disagreement with it.  Over all I don't believe a right to block exists.  The key point of it to me is that we continue to try to work together and make sure your concerns are addressed in a manner agreeable to everyone.  Which is really what the questions above are really trying to get to the heart of.

:::::: This ultimately is a public forum and the perception of ones actions is of extreme importance (I have learned that in a hard way). Even if I have came to know how you roll and am extremely appreciative of your capacity to argument a point, especially when we don't see eye-to-eye, as it make me reexamine my positions and actions. Ultimately this is also a political game, even if I believe in your good intentions I must put myself in your position as to consider your motivations and actions so to provide a valid, satisfying and useful response.
:::::: On the right to block, a value that I think is extreme importance for the safeguard of minority views and the community well being. It is covered and supported on the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] process step 6, with a reenforcement or prioritization of the necessity to repeat the process if a valid objection is not lifted. I don't defend that consensus is unanimity (all in agreement), it is a state of non stated opposition.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:43, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

:::::: Ok, I suppose I misunderstood what you meant by &quot;right to block&quot;, which is not quite the phrase I might have used to describe step 6.  IIRC there was some feeling that the particular processes was not the only accepted one for determining consensus, which is why the wording was [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Decision_making&amp;diff=803252&amp;oldid=803250 changed slightly] to allow for the fact that other methods are accepted and frequently employed and I was not following it particularly here.  I take your point about politics.  I can understand the value of putting yourself in my position and considering my motivations.
:::::: I suppose my view of consensus involves stating opposition when opposition exists.  I think now I understand some of the discussion about reconfiguring a bit better, and perhaps some of our previous disagreements stem from the different ways we think of consensus.

::That conclusion seems partial :). Why should the use I gave the page have less importance? The important here is not the originator but the receptor.
::Anyway I already expressed my views about the draft and if more people agree with the intended future use for it so be it, I will remove my objection.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:24, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

::: It wasn't my intention to make your contributions seem less important.  The only point is that your here making your point of view clear.  And you feel the point of the page was not about editorial control, you didn't object to editorial control being part of the page, but the core focus of the page seemed to be about copyright and licensing concerns.
::: I suppose I wanted to make the point, was that copyright concerns were not how the page is being used in discussions, and that people will probably not get confused by context if we shift the meaning of the text now.

== Authors ==

One thing, that perhaps could be made clearer is the issue of Authorship.  I don't think it would be very appropriate for me to add anything about it at the moment, given that I am in a disagreement with Panic about the appropriateness of adding myself as an author of [[C++ Programming]].  But I do feel that the history here leaves something to be discussed.  For example there was some initial conflict about who could be listed in the page: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/About_the_Book/Authors&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=821846], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/About_the_Book/Authors&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=821939], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/About_the_Book/Authors&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=823095], this was perhaps unusual because the names being added were not by the people adding them (with the exception of Darklama who now choses not to include his name on the book).  Later Arlen22 attempted to add his name to the page (it was his first edit to the book, but was followed by other edits) and it was removed [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/About_the_Book/Authors&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1602820].  And later, after reading about the initial edit conflict in the history of this page I decided to add my name to the list. (In case anyone is curious yes I really did contribute a couple years ago).  And this was followed by a long discussion about what it means to be &quot;an author&quot;, and Panic felt my contributions were not extensive enough, I felt differently.  But I self reverted to return things to the status quo for the time being.  

:I have also done the same verification in other works that I'm not listed as author, or even contribute too. Of importance to note is the wording of the list, some clearly list contributors or contributions (or derivations) in authors/license pages. I have also removed people from those lists if they had not made any contribution to the works and in performed similar verifications/corrections in works that clearly list authors, IIRC never based on &quot;ratio&quot; or quality of contributions. The only requirement in those types of lists is that the persons adds or removes itself from these last.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:39, 3 December 2010 (UTC) 

I am personally of the opinion that the terms author/editor/contributor/etc. should be treated as synonyms in the wikibooks context, and that anyone who makes a &quot;significant edit&quot; (something slightly more then adding a {{tlx|BookCat}} should be considered an author on equal footing with anyone else who contributed to the book.  

Panic, if I understand correctly, feels there is and should be a distinction between these terms.  Further, that an author has both special rights (and liabilities?) in terms of relicensing the work.  (I could misunderstand, but I believe this is the whole book, as he can always relicense his own contributions.  He will explain better I am sure.)   

:My view is not specific about labels, nor treatment, only a statement that they in fact reflect different relations between the volunteer and the content he/she provides. The exact definitions of authorship (or copyright holder, that may not be the same) is hard to establish due to the various laws (regional and international) that it would have to cover, but in the previous version of the text we already had made much clearer to those interested in the subject (mostly contributors, the term of use is in general directed to reuse/distribution and the Wikimedia requirements, all very distinct subjects). I don't particularly defend &quot;author&quot; beyond what constitutes authorship in a legal setting, I see that as extremely important for works to be &quot;real&quot; outside of the Wikibook project, in fact I see that as something that would get us more valuable contributions and more volume. It would also address the ad-hoc way the situation has been always treated, I was by no means the first one to point to this issue or use an author/license page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:04, 3 December 2010 (UTC)  

I want to make very clear that I am making no accusations of right or wrong.  There is simply different points of view about the words should mean here at wikibooks.  It might be interesting to glance at our more detailed discussion at [[Talk:C++ Programming/About the Book/Authors]].

:The point is why should they have another meaning in the first place? And that links to the need to educate. The use of the word author on the Wikimedia software is an historical artifact (and I already explained why). I haven't verified but I'm certain that those that contributed content to Wikisource are strangely &quot;authors&quot; of those contributions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:04, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

I feel we should either explain the difference between these terms are (Roughly how much of a contribution must be made before one becomes an author of a book? What rights do you give up by not listing yourself as the author? What liabilities do you expose yourself to if you do list yourself as an author? etc.)

Or if we decide there is no difference, we should explicitly make that clear in the text as well.  Since it is a matter that can lead to some confusion. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:13, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

:The removed distinctions, and other considerations still in need to be created are relevant in regards to the legal protection of the project, the works and those contributors of intellectual propriety that so require.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 09:04, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

I think it would be a good idea to avoid mixing issues. How about [[Wikibooks:Authorship]] for proposing what the policy should be on authors? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:49, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

:No objection here, but I don't think we need, or should, build it to be a policy, at best a guideline if that (or as an unstable version of [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]]) . The issue is that we will be attempting to establishing a common ground on what are already defined legal matters (even if some things are open to interpretation as never legally tested) we will also be making terms or nomenclature clearer to the community. These are things that would have been best done by Wikimedia itself but for past discussion with people in the know there isn't even consensus on the subject there, and some issues are specific to Wikibooks.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:06, 3 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

|description = It grows to 3-10 m tall, and has alternate, pinnately compound leaves 25-55 cm long, each with 9-31 serrate leaflets 6-11 cm long. The leaf petioles and the stems are densely covered in rust-colored hairs.  The fruit of staghorn sumac is one of the most identifiable characteristics, forming dense clusters of small red drupes at the terminal end of the branches; the clusters are conic, 10-20 cm long and 4-6 cm broad at the base. The fruit appear during autumn, at which point the foliage turns a brilliant red. Sumacs are considered some of the best fall foliage around. The fruit has been known to last through winter and into spring.
|range = From Ontario and Quebec south to northern Georgia and Mississippi.
|seasons = Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
|use = The fruit drupes can be bruised and then soaked in water to make a refreshing '''lemonade-like drink'''.
|warning = Avoid the '''Poison Sumac''' tree which is easily identified by its white flowers.  Contact with poison sumac will cause a rash (like poison ivy).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A construction is when one constructs a figure (such as a square, an angle bisector, etc.) with a compass and a straightedge.

==Constructing a Congruent Segment to a Given Segment==
To Construct a congruent segment to a given segment, set your compass to the both endpoints of the given segment. Then from a starting point on the second line mark off the same distance using your compass. This segment is congruent to the given segment.

[[Image:CongruentSegments.jpg]]
 


== Equilateral Triangle ==

An example of a construction would be the construction of an equilateral triangle with two intersecting circles. Two circles are drawn with the same radius with a point from each circle intersecting the radius of the other circle.

[[Image:Equilateral_Triangle_Construction1.jpg]]

Then lines are drawn  from the radii to the intersection of the two circles and between the two radii.

[[Image:Equilateral_Triangle_Construction2.jpg]]

Now we have an equilateral triangle.



== Angle Bisector ==

To Construct an angle Bisector:
1. Put the center of the compass on the angle and mark an intersection on each line.

[[Image:Angle Bisector1.jpg]]

2. Put the center of the compass on one of the marked intersections and then mark two spots near the center.  Repeat this step on the other intersection.

[[Image:Angle Bisector2.jpg]]

3. Draw a line connecting the points of intersection and the angle.

[[Image:Angle Bisector 3.jpg]]
== Perpendicular Bisector ==
To construct the perpendicular bisector of a segment given the segment AB, first draw a circle centered at point A. 
Next draw with your compass a circle with the same radius as the first circle but centered at point B. 
Lastly, connect the points, called C and D where the two circles intersect. This segment is the perpendicular bisector.
Reasoning: Any point that is the same distance from the endpoints of a segment lies on the perpendicular bisector of that segment. Given two such points you can draw that line.

[[:Image:PerpendicularBisector2JPEG.jpg]]

== Constructing a Congruent Angle to a Given Angle ==
To construct a congruent angle to a given angle first draw a segment on which you are going to construct the congruent angle. Place a point on this segment that will be the vertex point of the new congruent angle. Draw an arc(part of a circle) that crosses both sides of the original angle. Then using the same setting as for this arc draw an arc from the point on the segment so that this arc has the same radius as the previous arc. next use your compass to measure the distance between the points where the first arc crosses the sides of the angle. Now going to the second arc with the same setting mark the same distance on this arc as on the first arc. Connect this point with the original point on the segment. 

[[Image:CongruentAngles.jpg ]]

== Constructing a Perpendicular Line through a Point on a Line ==
Given a point on a line, first draw a circle using this point as its center. Using the two points where the circle intersects the line draw two congruent arcs that intersect each other. This point is equal distance from both endpoints of the circle and thus on its perpendicular bisector as is the original point. Connect these two points to complete the construction.

[[Image:PerpendicularThruPoint.JPG]]

==Constructing a Perpendicular to a Line From a Point Not on That Line==
To construct a perpendicular to a line from a point not on that line, use the point as the center of an arc that intersects the line in two points. Your original point will lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment formed by these two new points. Using these points as the centers of two congruent arcs that intersect one another you get another point on this same perpendicular bisector. Connect this new point with your original point to finish this construction.

[[Image:PerpendicularPointNotOnLine.jpg]]

==Constructing a Triangle congruent to a Given Triangle(SSS Method)==
To construct a triangle congruent to a given triangle, first construct a base side in the same way as constructing a congruent segment. Measuring a second side of the given triangle with the compass draw an arc from one end of the constructed segment. Setting the compass to the length of the third side of the given triangle go to the second point of the constructed segment and draw another arc whose radius is the same as the third side and intersects the first arc. Connect this point of intersection with the endpoints of the constructed segment to finish the congruent triangle.

[[Image:ConstructCongruentTriangles.jpg]]
==Constructing a Triangle Congruent to a Given Triangle (the SAS Method) ==
To construct a Triangle congruent to a given triangle using the Side Angle Side method, you must first construct an angle congruent to one of the given angles of the first triangle. Then use the compass to measure one of the sides of the first triangle that is next to the angle and then measure the new side next to the new angle. Then measure the side on the other side of the angle of the first triangle and use it to construct the other side of the new triangle. Connect these two constructed points to make the third side of the new triangle.

|name = Wild Carrot (Queen Anne's Lace)
|image = Daucus carota inflorescence kz.jpg
|description = It is a biennial plant growing up to 1 m tall, bearing an umbel of bright white flowers that turn into a &quot;bird's nest&quot; seed case after blooming. Very similar in appearance to the deadly poison hemlock, it is distinguished by a mix of bi-pinnate and tri-pinnate leaves, fine hairs on its stems and leaves, a root that smells like carrots, and occasionally a single dark red flower in its center.
|seasons = Fall to Early Spring
|range = Waste ground, fields, throughout
|use = The '''roots''' of the wild carrot can be cleaned and used as regular carrots.  They are quite a bit smaller than domestic carrots, but the flavor is unmistakable.  It is best to use the roots of the plant during its first year.
|warning = Do not confuse the wild carrot with poison hemlock.  The root of the wild carrot smells like carrots.  Also the bracts beneath the flower heads are three-forked.  Poison hemlock has a smooth, hollow, jointed stem and often has purple spots. Queen Anne's Lace has none of these characteristics.

|name = Wild Onion
|image = Allium canadense.jpg
|description = Wild Onion has an edible bulb covered with a dense skin of brown fibers and tastes like an onion. The plant also has strong, onion-like odor. The narrow, grass-like leaves originate near the base of the stem, which is topped by a dome-like cluster of star-shaped, pink or white flowers. It typically flowers in the spring and early summer, from May to June.
|seasons = Spring - Winter
|range = Throughout North America
|use = Use the leaves and bulbs raw in '''salads''', or cook them in a '''soup'''.  Basically, use them as you would domestic onions.
|warning = Though the plant is edible, it pays to be careful in identifying it as there are several look-a-likes. So be sure to do more research before eating plant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{ {{BOOKTEMPLATE}} }}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==What writing systems does this language use?==
Although originally written in Arabic script, Swahili writing is now based on the Latin alphabet that was introduced by Christian missionaries and colonial governments.

The Swahili alphabet now contains all the same letters as English with the exception of q and x.

==How many people speak this language?==
About 5 million people speak Swahili as a '''native language'''. About 80 million people speak it as a '''secondary language'''. It is more common as a second language because it is used as a language of business in an area where there are many different tribal languages. People need to learn Swahili to buy and sell things with people who have other '''native languages'''.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|native language|the first language that a person learnt as a child.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|secondary language|any language that a person learns to speak after the first language that they learned at home.}}

==Where is this language spoken?==
[[Image:Maeneo_penye_wasemaji_wa_Kiswahili.png|thumb|left|200px|Distribution of Swahili in Africa]]
People primarily speak Swahili in Zanzibar and Tanzania.  There are smaller communities of Swahili speaking people in Burundi, Kenya, Mayotte, Mozambique, Oman, Rwanda, Somalia, South Africa, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.

==What is the history of this language?==
It is uncertain where or how Swahili first came about but it is general believed that Swahili speaking people have occupied their present territories, hugging the Indian Ocean, since well before AD 1000.

It appears to some researchers that Swahili started in a number of Arabic trading posts.  People speaking different dialects of Bantu, a local language, found that it was difficult to communicate with one another, so they adapted Arabic and Bantu to create a language for business, Swahili.

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
'''Utend̠i wa Tambuka''', which means &quot;The Story of Tambuka&quot;, is one of the oldest known pieces of literature in Swahili. The author of the story identifies himself as Mwengo, son of Athumani or Osman. Little is known of him. The story is about &quot;the Byzantine-Arab Wars&quot; and &quot;Byzantine-Ottoman Wars&quot; between the Muslims and Byzantines, covering a period from 628 AD to 1453 AD (the Fall of Constantinople). Like other early Swahili writing it was written with the Arabic script.

White must now decide which pawn structure he will adopt. The most flexible move is [[/3. Nc3/]], giving White some time before deciding. However, it denies the access to the Averbakh Variation ([[/3. c4/]]), the Geller's System([[/3. c3/]] and 4. Nf3) and the Three Pawns Attack ([[/3. c3/]] and 4. f4).

[[/3. Nf3/]] is also possible and will transpose early into the other variations.

|name = Plantago Major''', or '''Broadleaf Plantain
|image = Plantago major.jpg
|description = The Broadleaf Plantain or Greater Plantago (Plantago major) is a member of the plantago family, Plantaginaceae. In North America, this plant is primarily a weed, though it is edible and is used in herbal medicine. The plant is native to Europe, and is believed to be one of the first plants to naturalize in the colonies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This plant does best in compacted soils, and hence is sometimes called &quot;roadweed&quot;. It is commonly found on field boundaries as it is tolerant to pesticides and herbicides. It is wind-pollenated, and a cause of summer allergies when in flower.

|seasons = Best in Early Spring, also usable in Summer and Fall, but tough and stringy.
|range = Common lawn weed found throughout
|use = Crushed leaves can be applied directly to the skin to stop bleeding, bee stings and insect bites. Psyllium seeds are a bulk laxative.  The young leaves are delicious raw in ''salads''.  In summer and fall the leaves can be eaten when boiled as '''greens'''.

|name = Wild Strawberry
|image = Fragaria vesca 2.jpg
|description = Similar to the domestic variety, but the berries are quite a bit smaller, measuring about quarter inch (6 mm) in diameter.  The Woodland Strawberry was widely cultivated in Europe before being largely replaced by the Garden Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa and other hybrids), which have much larger berries. Woodland Strawberry fruit is strongly flavored, and is still grown on a small scale commercially for the use of gourmets.  Unlike most commercial and garden cultivars of strawberries, Woodland Strawberries rarely form runners, and are usually propagated by seeds or division of the plants.
|range = Throughout the Northern Hemisphere
|seasons = Summer
|use = The fruits can be eaten raw or cooked into '''jellies and jams'''.  It can also be baked into '''pies'''.  An herbal '''tea''' made from the leaves, stems, and flowers is believed to aid in the treatment of diarrhea.

| name = Milkweed
| image = Asclepias syriaca.jpg
| description = Common milkweed is a herbaceous perennial plant growing from a rhizome to 1-2 m tall. The stem is very hairy, and all parts of the plants produce a white latex when broken. The leaves are opposite, simple broad ovate-lanceolate, 7-25 cm long and 3-12 cm broad, usually with an undulate margin and a red-colored main vein. They have a very short petiole and a velvety underside.  The flowers are grouped in several spherical umbels with numerous flowers in each umbel. The individual flowers are small, 1-2 cm diameter, perfumed, with five cornate hoods. The seeds are attached to long, white flossy hairs and encased in large pods.
| range = Native to most of North America east of the Rockies, with the exception of the drier parts of the Prairies. It grows in sandy soils and appreciates lots of sunlight.
| seasons = Spring, Summer
| use = The stems, shoots, leaves, flowers, and young pods are all edible after they are boiled in several changes of water.  The milky sap tastes bitter and is mildly toxic, but boiling removes it completely.

      <comment>more detail on acorn leaching</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{EWP
| name = Acorn
| image = Amerikaanse eik eikels Quercus rubra acorns.jpg
| description = Acorns are the fruit of the oak tree.  They are a very important food source for wildlife.  Creatures that make acorns an important part of their diet include birds such as jays, pigeons, some ducks and several species of woodpeckers. Small mammals that feed on acorns include mice, squirrels and several other rodents. Large mammals such as pigs, bears and deer also consume large amounts of acorns; they may constitute up to 25% of the diet of deer in the autumn. However, acorns are toxic to some other animals, such as horses.  In some human cultures, acorns once constituted a dietary staple, though they are now generally only a very minor food.
| range = The oak is native to the northern hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cold latitudes to tropical Asia and the Americas.
| seasons = Fall
| use = The acorn contains tannin, which is very bitter and slightly toxic.  Luckily, tannin is easily removed by soaking in water.  Acorns from the white oak family have far less tannin than acorns from the black (or red) oak family, so if you have a choice, opt for white oaks.  The first acorns to fall from the tree are likely to contain worms and moth larvae.  Most of these bad acorns will float in water, while most good acorns will sink.  At the beginning of acorn season (late summer or early autumn) you will find that most of the acorns will float and very few will sink.  As the season progresses, you will find that most acorns will sink and few will float.  Once you have sorted them, shell them.  They can be opened with a pair of pliers or a nutcracker.  Remove the meat from the shell, crush it into a fine powder (use a mortar &amp; pestle or a food processor), and then soak it in water for about a week, changing the water twice a day.  If you choose to, you can speed this process by boiling the shelled, crushed acorns in several changes of water.  Native Americans would put the crushed acorns in a sack and then place the sack in a swift stream for several days.  If after soaking, the acorn mush is still bitter, it needs to soak longer.  When they are no longer bitter, spread them out on a cookie sheet and dry them in an oven at {{units|120°C|250°F}} for 90 minutes.  They can be used as '''flour''' or to make acorn mush - a staple of the Native American diet.  You can also skip crushing them and eat them as nuts, but uncrushed acorns will take much longer to leach.

| name = Autumn Olive
| image = Image-Cardinal Elaeagnus umbellata 1987.jpg
| description = Autumn olive is a small tree (or large shrub), growing 4-10 meters tall.  The leaves are lanceolate, shiny green on the top with a silvery, powdery underside.  The berries are about 6-7mm in diameter, bright red with speckles on them, growing in groups.  They are very sweet.
| range = Native to eastern Asia from the Himalayas east to Japan.  It was introduced to North America where it has become an invasive species.
| seasons = Fall
| use = When ripe, the fruit is juicy and edible. It can be eaten fresh or made into a jam.  The fruit is small, extremely numerous, tart-tasting, and it has a chewable seed. It has been shown to have from 7 to 17 times the amount of the antioxidant lycopene that tomatoes have. Lycopene has been consistently shown to be useful in decreasing the risk of prostate cancer.

| name = Pine Nuts
| image = StonePine.jpg
| description = Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pine trees. About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of value as a human food.  The nuts are located at the base of the scales of the cones.
| range = Temperate areas of North America, Europe, and Asia.
| seasons = Fall
| use = Pine nuts can be eaten raw or '''baked''' into a casserole.

| name = Pine Trees
| image = Pinus pinaster.jpg
| description = Pines are evergreen and resinous. The bark of most pines is thick and scaly, but some species have thin, flaking bark. The branches are produced in regular &quot;pseudowhorls&quot;, actually a very tight spiral but appearing like a ring of branches arising from the same point. Many pines are uninodal, producing just one such whorl of branches each year, from buds at the tip of the year's new shoot, but others are multinodal, producing two or more whorls of branches per year. The new spring shoots are sometimes called &quot;candles&quot;; they are light-colored and point upward at first, then later darken and spread outward.
| range = Pines are native to most of the Northern Hemisphere. In North America, they range from the Arctic south to Nicaragua and Hispaniola, with the highest diversity in Mexico and California. In Eurasia, they range from Portugal and Scotland east to the Russian Far East, Japan, and the Philippines, and south to northernmost Africa, the Himalaya and Southeast Asia, with one species (Sumatran Pine) just crossing the Equator in Sumatra. Pines are also extensively planted in many parts of the Southern Hemisphere
| seasons = All year
| use = The needles can be eaten year-round.  The young shoots can be eaten as '''candy''' when stripped of the needles, peeled, boiled until tender, and then simmered for 20-30 minutes in a sugary syrup.

| name = Day Lily
| image = Daylily - Stella de Oro.jpg
| description = The alternating lanceolate leaves are grouped into fans (a clump also containing the roots and the crown). The crown of a day lily is the small white portion of the stem, between the leaves and the roots.  The name &quot;day lily&quot; reflects the fact that the individual flowers last for only one day. The flowers of most species open at sunrise and wither at sunset, to be replaced by another one (sometimes two or none) on the same stem the next day; some species are night-blooming.
| range = Originally from Eurasia, native from Europe to China, Korea, and Japan, their large showy flowers have made them popular worldwide
| seasons = Early Spring (shoots), Summer (buds and flowers), All Year (tubers)
| use = The early shoots make a good addition to a '''salad'''.  The buds and flowers can be prepared by boiling or be made into '''fritters'''.  The tubers can also be added to salads or can be prepared like corn-on-the-cob.

Filmmaking is the process of making a film. The nature of the film determines the size and type of crew required during filmmaking. Many Hollywood adventure films employ a cast and crew of thousands and have complicated computer generated imagery (CGI), while a low-budget, independent film may be made with a skeleton crew, often paid very little. Filmmaking takes place all over the world using different technologies and techniques, and is produced in a variety of economic contexts that range from state-sponsored documentary in China to profit-oriented movie making within the American studio system.

== Stages of Filmmaking ==
The filmmaking production cycle consists of five main stages:
# Development
# Pre-production
# Production
# Post-production
# Distribution
An entire Hollywood-style production cycle typically takes three years. The first year is taken up with development. The second year comprises pre-production and production and the third year comprises post-production and distribution.

== Development ==
In development, an idea is fleshed out into a viable script. The producer of the movie will find a story, which may be from books, other films, true stories, original ideas, etc. Once the theme, or underlying message, has been identified, a synopsis will be prepared. This is followed by a step outline, which breaks the story down into one-paragraph scenes, concentrating on the dramatic structure. Next, a treatment is prepared. This is a 25 to 30 page description of the story, its mood and characters, with little dialog and stage direction, often containing drawings to help visualize the key points.

The screenplay is then written over a period of perhaps six months, and will be rewritten several times to improve the dramatization, clarity, structure, characters, dialog, and overall style. However, producers often skip the previous steps and develop submitted screenplays which are assessed through a process called script coverage. A film distributor should be contacted at an early stage to assess the likely market and hence financial success of the film. Hollywood distributors will adopt a hard-headed business approach and consider factors such as: the film genre, the target audience, the historical success of similar films, the actors who might appear in the film and the potential directors of the film. All these factors imply a certain attraction of the film to a possible audience and hence the number of &quot;bums on seats&quot; during the theatrical release. Films rarely make a profit from the theatrical release alone, therefore DVD sales and worldwide distribution rights need to be taken into account.

The movie pitch is then prepared and presented to potential film financiers. If the pitch is successful and the movie is given the &quot;green light&quot; then financial backing is offered, typically from a major film studio, film council or independent investors. A deal is negotiated and contracts are signed.

== Preproduction ==
In preproduction, the movie is designed and planned. The production company is created and a production office established. The production is storyboarded and visualised with the help of illustrators and concept artists. A production budget will also be drawn up to cost the film.

The Producer will hire people to fill the following roles:

* The director is primarily responsible for the acting in the movie and manages the creative elements.
* The assistant director (AD) manages the shooting schedule and logistics of the production among other tasks.
* The casting director finds actors for the parts in the script. This normally requires an audition by the actor. Lead actors are carefully chosen and are often based on the actor's reputation or &quot;star power.&quot;
* The location manager finds and manages the film locations. Most pictures are shot in the predictable environment of a studio sound stage but occasionally outdoor sequences will call for filming on location.
* The production manager manages the production budget and production schedule. He or she also reports on behalf of the production office to the studio executives or financiers of the film.
* The director of photography (DOP) or cinematographer creates the photography of the film. He or she cooperates with the director, director of audiography (DOA) and AD.
* The art director manages the art department, which makes production sets, costumes and provides makeup &amp; hair styling services.
* The production designer creates the look and feel of the production sets, costumes, make up and hairstyles, working with the art director to create these elements.
* The storyboard artist creates visual images to help the director and production designer communicate their ideas to the production team.
* The production sound mixer manages the audio experience during the production stage of a film. He or she cooperates with the director, DOP, and AD.
* The sound designer creates new sounds and enhances the aural feel of the film with the help of foley artists.
* The composer creates new music for the film.
* The choreographer creates and coordinates the movement and dance - typically for musicals. Some films also credit a fight choreographer.

== Production ==
In production the movie is actually created and shot. More crew will be recruited at this stage such as the property master, script supervisor, assistant directors, stills photographer, picture editor, and sound editors. These are just the most common roles in filmmaking and the production office will be free to create any unique blend of roles to suit a particular film.

A typical day's worth of shooting begins with an assistant director following the shooting schedule for the day. The film set is constructed and the props made ready. The lighting is rigged, the camera and sound recording equipment are set up. At the same time the actors are wardrobed in their costumes and attend the hair and make-up departments.

The actors rehearse their script and blocking with the director. The picture and sound crews then rehearse with the actors. Finally, the action is shot with as many takes as the director sees fit.

Each take of a shot follows a slating procedure and is marked on a clapperboard, which helps the editor keep track of the takes in post-production. The clapperboard records the scene, take, director, director of photography, date, and name of the film written on the front, and is displayed for the camera. The clapperboard also serves the necessary function of providing a marker to sync up the film and the sound take. Sound is recorded on a separate apparatus from the film and they must be synched up in post-production.

The director will then check to see if the shot was good or not. The script supervisor, sound and camera teams mark every take as either good (G or a circle around the take's number) or not good (NG) on their respective report sheets. Every report sheet records important facts about each take.

When shooting is finished for the scene, the director declares a &quot;wrap.&quot; The crew will &quot;strike,&quot; or dismantle, the set for that scene. The director approves the next day's shooting schedule and a daily progress report is sent to the production office. This includes the report sheets from continuity, sound, and camera teams. Call sheets are distributed to the cast and crew to tell them when and where to turn up the next shooting day.

For productions using traditional photographic film, the unprocessed negative of the day's takes are sent to the film laboratory for processing overnight. Once processed, they return from the laboratory as dailies or rushes (film positives) and are viewed in the evening by the director, above the line crew, and sometimes, the cast. For productions using digital technologies, shots are downloaded and organized on a computer for display as dailies.

When the entire film is in the can, filmmaking lingo for the completion of the production phase, the production office normally arranges a wrap party to thank all the cast and crew for their efforts.

== Post-production ==
In post-production, the film is assembled by the film editor. The modern use of video in the filmmaking process has resulted in two workflow variants: one using entirely film, the other using a mixture of film and video:

1. In the film workflow, the original camera film (negative) is developed and copied to a one-light workprint (positive) for editing with a mechanical editing machine. An edge code is recorded onto film to locate the position of picture frames. Since the development of editing software such as Final Cut Pro or Avid, the film workflow is used by very few productions.

2. In the video workflow, the original camera negative is developed and telecined to video for editing with computer editing software. A timecode is recorded onto video tape to locate the position of picture frames. Production sound is also synced up to the video picture frames during this process.

The first job of the film editor is to build a rough cut taken from sequences (or scenes) based on individual &quot;takes&quot; (shots). The purpose of the rough cut is to select and order the best shots. The next step is to create a fine cut by getting all the shots to flow smoothly in a seamless story. Trimming, the process of shortening scenes by a few minutes, seconds, or even frames, is done during this phase. After the fine cut has been screened and approved by the director and producer the picture is &quot;locked,&quot; meaning no further changes are made. Next, the editor creates a negative cut list (using edge code) or an edit decision list (using timecode) either manually or automatically. These edit lists identify the source and the picture frame of each shot in the fine cut.

Once the picture is locked, the film passes out of the hands of the editor to the sound department to build-up the sound track. The voice recordings are synchronised and the final sound mix is created. The sound mix combines sound effects, background sounds, ADR, dialogue, walla, and music.

The sound track and picture are combined together, resulting in a low quality answer print of the movie. There are now two possible workflows to create the high quality release print depending on the recording medium:

# In the film workflow, the cut list that describes the film-based answer print is used to cut the original colour negative (OCN) and create a colour timed copy called the colour master positive or interpositive print. For all subsequent steps this effectively becomes the master copy. The next step is to create a one-light copy called the colour duplicate negative or internegative. It is from this that many copies of the final theatrical release print are made. Copying from the internegative is much simpler than copying from the interpositive directly because it is a one-light process; it also reduces wear-and-tear on the interpositive print.
# In the video workflow, the edit decision list that describes the video-based answer print is used to edit the original colour tape (OCT) and create a high quality colour master tape. For all subsequent steps this effectively becomes the master copy. The next step uses a film recorder to read the colour master tape and copy each video frame directly to film to create the final theatrical release print.

Finally the film is previewed, normally by the target audience, and any feedback may result in further shooting or edits to the film.

== Distribution ==
In distribution, the movie is released to cinemas or, occasionally, to DVD, VCD or VHS (though VHSs are less common now that more people own DVD players). The movie is duplicated as required for theatrical distribution. Press kits, posters, and other advertising materials are published and the movie is advertised.

The movie will usually be launched with a launch party, press releases, interviews with the press, showings of the film at a press preview, and/or film festivals. It is also common to create a website to accompany the movie. The movie will play at selected cinemas and the DVD is typically released a few months later. The distribution rights for the movie and DVD are also usually sold for worldwide distribution. Any profits are divided between the distributor and the production company.

== Independent filmmaking ==
Filmmaking
also takes place outside of the studio system and is commonly called independent filmmaking. Since the introduction of DV technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot and edit a movie, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. However, the Internet has allowed for relatively inexpensive distribution of independent films; many filmmakers post their films online for critique and recognition. Although there is little profitability in this, a filmmaker can still gain exposure via the web.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Altitude sickness can begin in susceptible people at elevations as low as {{units|2400 meters|8,000 ft}}. The early symptoms are drowsiness, feeling unwell, and weakness, especially during exercise. More severe symptoms are headache, poor sleep, persistent rapid pulse, nausea and sometimes vomiting, especially in children. More severe symptoms include pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs; persistent coughing), confusion, psychosis, hallucination and death.

Victims can sometimes control mild altitude sickness by consciously taking ten to twelve rapid large breaths every five minutes. If overdone, this can blow off too much carbon dioxide and cause tingling in the extremities of the body. The quickest cure is to reduce the victim's altitude if possible. Some mountain rescue groups carry acetazolamide (a prescription drug) to treat mountain sickness, injectable steroids to reduce pulmonary edema, and inflatable pressure vessels to relieve and evacuate severe mountain-sick persons.

Altitude acclimatization has two stages. Overnight, the body can adjust its carbonic acid balance, and substantially improve its performance. Over four to six weeks, the body can grow more blood cells, strengthen the heart and make other tissue changes. Above {{units|5,500 meters|18,000ft}}, further altitude exposure weakens, rather than strengthening one's acclimation.

| name = Sulphur Shelf
| image = Sulphur shelf fungus.jpg
| description = Sulphur shelf (Laetiporus sulphureus) is also known as the chicken of the woods, the chicken mushroom, and the chicken fungus. It is, as one might expect, an edible mushroom with a taste quite similar to lemony chicken. Individual &quot;shelves&quot; range from 2-10 inches across. These shelves are made up of many tiny tubular filaments (hyphae). The mushroom grows in large brackets - some have been found that weigh over 100 pounds (45 kg). It is most commonly found on wounds of trees, mostly oak, though it is also frequently found on yew, cherry wood, sweet chestnut, and willow. Though it does grow off of a living tree, sulphur shelf is not a parasite, though it may cause decay.  Young mushrooms are characterized by a moist, rubbery, sulphur-yellow body with bright orange tips. Older mushrooms become pale and brittle, pungent, and are often dotted with termite holes. 
| seasons = Late Summer to Fall
| range = Throughout most of the world
| use = Slice thinly and add to '''stews''' or simmer for 30 minutes.
| warning = About half of the population has an allergic reaction to this type of mushroom, with cases being more pronounced in older mushrooms. Due to all of these factors, the mushroom should generally only be eaten when young, and one should always only try a small amount the first time.

| name = Giant Puffball Mushroom
| image = Langermannia gigantea R0018880.JPG
| description = Most giant puffballs grow to be 10 to 70 cm in diameter, although occasionally some can reach diameters up to 150 cm and weights of 20 kg. The inside of the mature Giant puffballs is greenish brown, whereas the interior of immature puffballs is white. The large white mushrooms are edible when young.
| range = Throughout North America
| seasons = Late Summer, Fall
| use = Cooked vegetable, or use like cultivated mushrooms
| warning = Cut the mushroom open before using it, and check for rudimentary gill or stem. The deadly Amanitas looks like a puffball when it is young before its stem grows, but it will have the gills or stem. Also, make sure  the interior flesh is pure white rather than yellowish.

== Unstable version created ==

I sometimes prefer [[Meatball:DocumentMode|DocumentMode]] to [[Meatball:ThreadMode|ThreadMode]], so I created this unstable version of the [[WB:WIW]] policy that anyone can edit. This is because the [[WB:WIW]] policy is enforced; we cannot make drastic changes there unless we have community consensus, but we can make drastic changes ''here''.

Want to propose a change? See something wrong? [[m:Be bold]] and edit the document. I chose to call it &quot;unstable&quot; to indicate the difference between this page and the policy. Eventually we will decide whether we want to merge any changes back to the policy. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:15, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

:I wish this had been done with the game guide policy change first, and yes, I do like what you've done here.  This page ([[WB:WIW]]) is the most often quoted page for the VfD discussions and unfortunately does need to read more like a constitution, hence the many sections and going into depth where common sense really should prevail.  And unfortunately this had to be expanded because there are objections and real-world experience that requires us to be very explicit to some new users and to Wikipedia deletionists who want to move Wikipedia content here to this project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks:Inclusion criteria/Proposal ==

I have made a proposal for an alternative text for WB:WIW on Wikibooks:Inclusion_criteria/Proposal, which takes a fundamentally different (and more positive) approach to the current wording and the wording in this unstable version. I would very much welcome comments on that text, with a view towards making this live in the next few weeks. Kind regards, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:18, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

== Missing Sections ==

There are a number of specific clauses and caveats from the original [[WB:WIW]] that are missing from this rewrite, that (i think) really must be included in some way or another. For instance, the NPOV clause, the Soapbox clause, the Original Research clause (although this is touched on under the &quot;invented&quot; restriction, but i dont think that covers as much ground). I appreciate that much of the material is better then it was (more positive, definately). but we can't leave out important rules like that. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:04, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

:This proposal is not intended to replace WB:NPOV, or indeed to cover similar topics (although they are both content-related ideas). To deal with your point, I suggest adding a &quot;see also&quot; or &quot;related policies&quot; section at the end to refer to it. (We also have other content-related policies, eg no copyvios, that could also be linked to in this way.)

:A diatribe is not a textbook - so I don't think we need a separate soapbox clause to deal with the mischief (also a diatribe is likely to conflict with the separate WB:NPOV policy).

:The &quot;invented&quot; restriction is meant to cut out original research. Maybe it could be tweaked to better reflect this, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:33, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

::I've made [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AInclusion_criteria%2FProposal&amp;diff=504866&amp;oldid=492850 this amendment] in the light of your comments, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:40, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

::I like the admendments that you have made here, although I still think that the Soapbox clause needs to be stated directly. Don't forget that there are certainly courses taught at seminaries that preach about the benefits of one religion or another. A textbook on a religion is acceptable, but we need to point out that a &quot;why you should learn to love my god/goddess/flying spaghetti monster&quot; is unacceptable. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:20, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

:::The current &quot;soapbox clause&quot; in WB:WIW bars propaganda, advocacy, personal essays, advertising and self promotion. Of that, propaganda and advocacy are, to my mind, already blocked by WB:NPOV. (I note that the wording of WB:WIW associates advocacy with propaganda and so needs to be interpreted in that sense - otherwise we'd ban almost everything (having a book on learning French by itself advocates that French is a worthy subject to study).)

:::This leaves personal essays (which aren't textbooks, so fail that criterion), advertising (explicitly blocked by 1.3(e) of the proposal) and self promotion (the textbook and/or advertisiing criteria are likely to block this).

:::As all the parts of the current &quot;soapbox clause&quot; are blocked by other provisions, I do not see a need to be explicit about it in this policy, although I do think that perhaps a separate interpretation page might be a good idea (it could include Rob Horning's suggested guidance on how-to books and games books as well). By this I mean - keep policies short and simple, although allow official guidance on how to apply it to certain circumstances as well.

:::Incidentally, I don't see any problem with a book that would help people develop their religious and spiritual beliefs. We have, as one of our larger and better books, the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]]. To my mind that sort of book is entirely within our remit - and so would textbooks on how to be a good Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian, Shi'ite, Sunni, Jew, or whatever. Religious proselytising should be banned from Wikibooks - but to my mind already NPOV captures that, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:11, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

== Objection to Heavy Mention of Textbook-only for Wikibooks ==

I've argued this point at several places, including the Staff Lounge and the [[WB:WIW]] talk page.

The main point was that for some time Wikibooks had a clause &quot;As a general rule, any book you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of your local library or bookshop is acceptable.&quot;

Jimbo, without any commentary or input from the user community, changed this clause and caused a major debate over the future of Wikibooks.  In addition, dispite statements by Jimbo that this was a community driven process, some individuals with admin privileges have been pushing as if Wikibooks was only for textbooks, and even invented a fiction that Wikibooks had always been just textbooks.

Going back to the original rule that was stated above, I really do believe that most reasonable, citable, and conforming to NPOV standards, GFDL, and other exclusions non-fiction material could be added to Wikibooks, as long as it is going to be a '''book'''.  Not a textbook, but simply a publishable book in some future form.  Wikibooks is about writing larger content that would not be appropriate for Wikipedia primarily due to length and in-depth focus of the material.

With all of the comments in this inclusion criteria, I think I could imagine expanding a Wikipedia article on Wikibooks that wouldn't necessarily fit with a traditional view of what is a textbook.  In addition, the very definition of a textbook is missing here, and if this is going to be used as a policy guide to say that one particular group of text is acceptable and another is not, an arbitrary &quot;this is not a textbook&quot; is simply tyranny and very subjective.  And as attested by the fact that huge swaths of content have been removed from Wikibooks in the past few months, this is also a very significant policy change, not merely a tweaking of existing policies.

I'm not saying that this viewpoint that Wikibooks should only be for textbooks is a bad idea by itself, but it is a major change in direction for the project and ignoring the efforts of many individuals in the past.  I'm also saying that by ''codifying'' that Wikibooks is only for textbooks, as this policy page does, it sets a very different tone for participation in Wikibooks.  This inclusion criteria pushes that textbook-only attitude much more than has been present in the previous policy.

I am noting that this is still a controversial element, and something that should not be ignored.  And that any future Wikibookians should be made aware that Wikibooks wasn't always this anal about sticking with a strictly accredited college course-specific textbook as the comparitor to content on this website.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:56, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

:As an analogy, Wikipedia is strictly for the creation of encyclopedia articals that are actually fit for inclusion in an encyclopedia. This does not mean that many people have not expended their energy at that project to create materials that were not suitable, and therefore had their hard work removed. I agree with you in spirit: I don't think it's a good idea to limit wikibooks to simply textbooks for accredited or respected institutions. However, I am highly disinclined to disobey a direct order from Jimbo, regardless of whether or not his order was the result of a democratic process, or a community concensus. I would like it if wikibooks followed the old guidelines that you are talking about, however I will not fight it if we must follow these &quot;new&quot; guidelines. And maybe I am not getting as worked up about this issue because I spend most of my time working on projects that strictly ''are textbooks''. If Jimbo came in here, and with a wave of his hand declared wikibooks was not for science and engineering topics, maybe I would throw a fit of my own. At any rate, as far as i am capable, I empathize, but I cannot in good conscience work to promote a policy change (or perhaps a policy &quot;revert&quot;) that could possibly bring bad to our project. Change Jimbo's mind on this, and I will throw my full support behind it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:17, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

::I could quote Jimbo here where he says that he is not changing policy, but that would be a futile effort.  I think on this issue it would be better to go back to the hows and whys of what started Wikibooks in the first place, and I would admit that textbooks were a major focus of the discussions.  The problem I see is that some individuals acting as administrators are violating at least the spirit of [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] that strongly encouraging concensus with the community before content is deleted.  To quote some points that seem to be violated right now:
::*As a general rule, don't delete pages you nominate for deletion if there are a number of comments in favour of keeping. Let someone else do it.
::*Use common sense and respect the judgment and feelings of other Wikibooks participants.
::*When in doubt, don't delete.
::Instead, content is being deleted in a wonton fashion without regards to objections by users.  This is flat out wrong and has changed the character of Wikibooks.  I see this inclusion criteria to be used as a tool to do further damage to Wikibooks, and a reason why I am raising my voice concerning the points expressed here, particularly in regards to this policy discussion on this page.  Or most importantly a part of the deletion policy that is also forgotten:  ''&quot;Be friendly! Everyone was new once.&quot;''  Can we get that sort of spirit into this inclusion criteria?
::In addition, I find that the &quot;new&quot; guidelines are incredibly ambiguous that have been espoused by Jimbo, and I have yet to see a reasonable definition of a textbook that can be used as rationale for deleting Wikibooks content.   Saying something is &quot;not a textbook&quot; as the justification for deletion is so subjective that I don't know where to begin.  But I also don't want to get into wheel warring with other admins if they start to remove content of that nature.  Perhaps maybe I should.  
::BTW, you might want to read [[w:Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information]] to see why people are adding the kinds of content, including video game walkthroughs, onto Wikibooks.  Apparently Wikipedia thinks they belong here as a matter of policy.  I'm really surprised that Jimbo hasn't changed this page (although I think he may be too timid to be that bold on Wikipedia).  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:20, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

I've made [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWhat_Wikipedia_is_not&amp;diff=62076198&amp;oldid=61902111 this amendment] to that Wikipedia policy, together with commenting on the talk page. We'll have to see if it holds, or if it generates further discussion.

In response to Rob (mostly his initial comments), I'd like to say that I agree that everything that meets the &quot;accredited instution&quot; metric is suitable for Wikibooks. My version of wording this metric is as follows:

:A textbook is....

:*a is a book which is actually usable in an existing class. 

:That class may be at school, college, university, a professional training centre or an adult education centre. We would expect the subject to be taught in a number of learning institutions, one in the whole world is not enough

However, I do not believe that Wikibooks' content should be restricted just to content that meets that metric. That is why I added the additional bit saying that our content includes:

:...book[s] written in a similar style to books usable in existing classes and which is about a subject worthy of study 

:Some topics worthy of study are not taught in formal classes. However, it is still possible to have an instructional textbook about them.

It would be useful if Rob could indicate whether he agrees with this formulation, and if he does not, how he would formulate a definition of what this inclusion criterion should be.

I would also like to add that I believe it is liberating and less restrictive to not attempt to define &quot;textbook&quot;. We all have a general idea of what one is. Any definition is likely to restrict this, and to reduce our flexibility, and I don't really think it would be useful to try to come up with a definition, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 20:52, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

== Duplicate policy ==
From [[WB:WIW]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the word textbook is somewhat open to interpretation, this document exists to help clarify which types of content are acceptable for Wikibooks&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That aside, I think we are much better off defining what a ''Wikibook'' is, rather than defining ''textbook'' in a way that fits the scope of this project. The latter is only prone to lead us astray in semantics if we clash against a colloquial understanding of &quot;textbook&quot;.

Defining &quot;Wikibook&quot; will keep us focused on the specific purpose of this project alongside its sister projects and force our arguments to center on what type of material is fitting for inclusion. I think we should rather use the word &quot;textbook&quot; in WB:WIW as an explanation, not a definition. But, either way, we already have a definition of [[WB:WIW|what wikibooks is]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:18, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

:In general, I think the difference here is unnecessary. If we say &quot;wikibooks is for the creation of open-content electronic textbooks&quot;, that statement alone challenges the ''normal'' definition of a what a textbook is to make the difference between normal textbooks and our textbooks obvious. However, if people want to change the word, that's find with me too, I think of it as a non-issue. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:58, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

:: A non-issue, yes. But in the sense that is a question, not so much of substance, but of semantics ... which becomes an issue in definitions. &lt;code&gt;;-)&lt;/code&gt;
:: But as I said; either way, the definition already exists on WB:WIW. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:31, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:::I disagree, I don't think this is duplicate material. [[WB:WIW]] states that wikibooks is for &quot;textbooks&quot;, but never goes on to define specifically what that word means. [[WB:WIW]] does, however, describe a bunch of things that can be here, and a bunch of things that cannot, but the word &quot;textbook&quot; remains unambiguous. If people would like to reject this page and instead expand the explanations on [[WB:WIW]], that would be acceptable too. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 11:34, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:::: ''but never goes on to define specifically what that word means.'' Exactly. And this proposal doesn't define it either but, just as WB:WIW, only lists what-it-is-and-isn't. Therefore, I see it a duplicate.
:::: I think we should, if only for simplicity's sake, rather make WIW more clear and the one stop for understanding what a wikibook is. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:47, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:::::Fair enough, I can understand your reasoning for that. I say that we do a few things:
:::::#use this proposal page as a scratch pad to gather our ideas
:::::#Come up with consensus on this proposal
:::::#Merge the text of this page into WB:WIW
:::::That way we don't need to work on rewording WB:WIW directly (which I'm sure will ruffle a few feathers), and we can still work towards clarity. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:51, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

:::::: Good suggestion. I'm not sure, though, that we can merge any really good ideas with WIW without ruffling feathers... Brainstorming and trying out some approaches for size would be good. Do you want to wait till some specific week to properly involve the community, or might it be better to start now in paralell and advertise it in the Lounge just to get some ideas going (as this will probably take much longer than a week!). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 03:08, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

I was reasonably certain that this proposal had been advertised in staff lounge. If you would like to advertise it again, that would be fine by me. I think it would be very good for the community to get this proposal settled once and for all, regardless of whether the final policy resides here or on WIW. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:12, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

:Yup, it was announced there when I started it... if there's nothing more to add to it, maybe we could propose a merger with WIW, and get it done. 
:I had hoped to figure out what's to be done on both the video-game guides and the new batch of religious books first though. I'm pretty sure the former is pretty much a moot discussion (kind of a Jimbo fait d'accompli), the religion texts need some more careful scrutiny, because it requires some pondering on the meaning of NPOV. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:19, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

::Yeah, unfortunately there is never a moment when there is only one issue to be resolved around here. It seems like everytime we start a new project, 10 more demand our attention. The videogame guides I don't see as a pressing problem, I have been taking a ''Laissez-faire'' approach to that issue, because it seems that many of the guides are migrating away from here of their own volition. The religion texts I am also inclined to view with lieniency because it is my experiance that the people who most want to talk about religion are the people least capable of writing with perfect NPOV. Just because it isnt perfect doesnt mean it can't improve, and I am inclined to post warnings, but let those texts improve. That said, a precise definition of &quot;textbook&quot; here could settle both those issues. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:25, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

== Merged ==

Wikibooks:Textbook and Wikibooks:Inclusion_criteria have now both been merged into this proposed policy as a result of my query on the staff lounge. This should make it easier for the community to work together to update this policy, rather then dividing efforts. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:54, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

==Further edits==
I've made some amendments, which I hope will be seen as improvements. I do think this unstable version is much better than the original - I hope it can go live in the not too distant future. [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 21:50, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

I think some changes were improvements and some things weren't. I think your changes removed some clarity and facts:
* Even though dictionaries, thesaurus, books of quotations, etc. are books that may be useful for learning, they don't belong here.
* Wikibooks isn't the place to upload books and works of literature, they can only be used as part of annotated texts.

I'll try to make some improvements of my own. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:02, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Ownership&quot; section ==
I understand the desire to include a section on &quot;Ownership&quot;, but I dont think this is the correct place to do it, and I will vote against this new version so long as that section remains in this text. WIW is supposed to be a note about what wikibooks is, and what kinds of content are appropriate. This is not the place to start discussing behavioral issues. If we want to have a large, over-arching behavior policy &quot;Wikibooks:How to act at wikibooks&quot;, or something, we can have that, but this isnt the place to discuss behavior. I won't remove that section myself, but I don't think it should be here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:03, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

I wasn't looking to make it a behavior police by having it here, so it may need some rework, rather to address who owns contributed contents. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

:A thought about ownership here, and something missing from the section in this version of the policy:  People who add content to Wikibooks really do own copyright over everything that they add.  Ownership in this sense is entirely correct that people do &quot;own&quot; the words that they write, and they are free to reuse and copy that content which they used in any way they want to.  In fact, they &quot;own&quot; it and can even sell it for a profit under a propritary copyright license (or no license at all).  By contributing to Wikibooks the only stipulation is that you have &quot;granted&quot; a license to that content under the terms of the GFDL.  I know this is a technical distinction, but it is something that is important never the less.
:Still, there is a tendancy for people to become very attached to something they have worked hard and long on, and to then see it get modified, edited, or even deleted to then get very upset over those who do that modification.  This is a natural response, even if modifying the content is explicitly granted under the GFDL.  There is also an unwritten rule (at least until this policy becomes official) that by adding the content to Wikibooks that you are allowing the content &quot;to be edited mercilessly and redistributed at will&quot; by other people.
:In software engineering terms, this is akin to what is called &quot;egoless programming&quot;, and is a radical concept in terms of collaborative authorship.  While most of you who are reading this are likely to be familiar with this general idea, it is important to remember how much of a change this is over traditional forms of authorship.  You do &quot;own&quot; the words, but you don't really have control over how they will be manipulated and changed.  Now on how to explain that more clearly..... ---[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

:: The issue of becoming attached to work contributed to a book and not wishing for it to be be edited without mercy and issue of wanting to control the contents of the book are what I'm trying to address, without resorting to addressing specific behaviors and to make clear the distinction between traditional forms of authorship and what is used here. For now I've combined the Ownership and Censorship sections since I think they deal with a similar issue, but I agree need to find a clearer way to explain it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

== General Opinions about this policy ==
I would like to air a few opinions of mine here, as this seems to be the most active policy discussion, and simultaneously the policy discussion that has the potential to have one of the biggest affects on our project for some time to come. At stake, essentially, is our ability to formally define what ''the wikibooks project is all about'', something that has only been poorly defined (or completely undefined) in the past. There are alot of points in this policy that have always been policy, but have been similarly ill-defined. Some of these concepts, such as &quot;No Original Research&quot; or &quot;Neutral Point of View&quot; are central to the Wikimedia way of doing business and will not be changed/removed, but which are open to some reinterpretation.

On an auxiliary note, I'm of  the opinion that we would benefit from having more policy documents that are all shorter and more precise then we are having a few monolithic policy documents. It would be better, I think, to have this policy lay down the most basic and broad rules for our site, and refer to other, smaller policy documents to clarify the details. For instance, this policy could say &quot;Wikibooks is for textbooks&quot;, and then point a link to [[Wikibooks:Textbooks]] to fill in the details. Of course, I'm not going to vote against this policy because of a nitpick in the document's structure, but it is something that i would like people to put some attention into. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:14, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

== Move to Enforce ==

I propose we move the current text of this proposal to {{tl|policy}}, in lieu of the current text at [[WB:WIW]]. There are a number of changes, clarifications, and simplifications in this version, and I think they will be a benefit to this community to have them. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:29, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

*'''Support''' &amp;ndash; I support moving of the [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|oldid=696721}} current] text of this proposal to being an official policy. There are many changes that clarify what is current practise, while trying to not draw a line too much, which I think will make it useful to the community for quite some time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:43, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Support''' --- Ah, who am I kidding. A couple of minor issues here and there, but I'd much rather have this in place of the current [[WB:WIW]], even with those issues. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 21:50, 22 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Move to re-start''' &amp;mdash; I realise that my recent edits have significantly changed the policy, though I hope that they have neither changed the original intent nor the current scope of Wikibooks. On the contrary, I hope that they have more precisely defined what is appropriate at Wikibooks, so as to provide helpful interpretive tools with which to eliminate confusion. Put another way, I do not intend to make last-minute behind-the-scenes changes while everyone is away for the holidays. I therefore move for this current discussion process to end with no decision made, and a new movement to enforcement be made when people (including me) work out their issues with my recent additions. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:29, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Oppose''' --- While I like the direction this is going, I think there are some important but missing sections that the older policy still covers.  See discussion below for specifics.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:38, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

'''Closed'''. I agree with [[User:Iamunknown]]. There have been a number of changes to this policy since this motion was started, and I think there are plenty of changes yet to be made. We can move to enforce this one again latter, when the proposal is more stable. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:24, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Motion to discussion and form concensus on each section seperately. ==
I propose we try to organize this discussion better, by discussion only one section at a time and try to get concensus on that one section before moving on to another section of this prososal. That way any issues with a specific section can be dealt with in turn. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:49, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;Final Word&quot; clause ==
There was one previously, but it appears to have been removed. I want to reinstitute the &quot;final word&quot; clause into this document. Wikibooks policy and guidelines are fragmented, as in it is distributed among multiple documents. It is very possible for one policy to disagree with another policy. Considering the amount of change that has happened in terms of policy recently, and considering the massive age disparities between some of our newest and some of our oldest policy documents, I think it's important that we have something that is the &quot;final word&quot;, that is something that trumps any other document in the event of a contradiction. I propose therefore the addition of the following text (barring revision) to the &quot;Enforcement&quot; section of this policy:
:''Any clause in a policy or guideline on the English Wikibooks that contradicts this policy is null and void.''
I think this is an important addition. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:31, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

----

Best to change it to ''Any policy or guideline on the English Wikibooks, approved before this one, that contradicts it will be null and void on the conflicting point(s) and should be marked for revision.'', since we rarely (I can't remember once) did vote a police clause/point by point. This should probably be added not only to this policy but to any policy we adopt/change in the future, this should cover all bases. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:39, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:I dont think we need to specify only policies that are approved beforehand. We could very easily approve a new policy that contradicts this one, and we still need some kind of final authority when a contradiction occurs. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:59, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

:: So... The changes I propose to the phrase clearly state that only the points in conflict will be void (as in the ones that should be fallowed are on the present policy), that's basically the same as in you proposal, the change also states priority, the last approved changes/policy will have an higher priority. (the last text discussed and approved might if conflicts arise be taken as the final word of the community, it goes even further proposing for a new discussion on that specific problematic point, I can't see how more complete it can be made.) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

'''DISCUSSION MOVED TO''' [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] as [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#.22Final_Word.22_clause_.28proposal.29 proposal named ''&quot;Final Word&quot; clause (proposal)''] --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:15, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

== Wikibooks community ==
The wikibooks community (our members, our policies/guidelines, and our methods) are defined by our mission to produce open-content textbooks. Every rule, every guideline, every page and every process should be examined by asking &quot;how does this help us to create textbooks?&quot; If something doesnt help towards the mission (and I would allow for things that help indirectly) it should be considered in violation of this policy. I think that such a mention should be included here: that all pages, not just textbook content, must satisfy the requirements of this content. We may also want to include some specifications here about the kinds of acceptable meta content (talk/discussion pages, a certain level of bureaucracy, and the fact that wikibooks is not a general-purpose discussion forum). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:44, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

:I have added this text: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks%2FUnstable&amp;diff=735419&amp;oldid=735417
:We can remove this if people don't want it, or we can rewrite it if we need to. I do think it's an important point to make though, and I think this is the best place to make it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:25, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A company has a permanent establishment in a territory if, and only if&lt;ref&gt;[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 148 of the Finance Act 2003|Section 148 of the Finance Act 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;:
  
*it has a fixed place of business there through which the business of the company is wholly or partly carried on, or 
*an agent acting on behalf of the company has and habitually exercises there authority to do business on behalf of the company. 

For this purpose a &quot;fixed place of business&quot; includes: 
  
*a place of management; 
*a branch; 
*an office; 
*a factory; 
*a workshop; 
*an installation or structure for the exploration of natural resources; 
*a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources; 
*a building site or construction or installation project. 

A company is not regarded as having a permanent establishment in a territory by reason of the fact that it carries on business there through an agent of independent status acting in the ordinary course of his business. Also, a company is not regarded as having a permanent establishment in a territory by reason of the fact that:
  
*a fixed place of business is maintained there for the purpose of carrying on activities for the company, or 
*an agent carries on activities there for and on behalf of the company, 

if, in relation to the business of the company as a whole, the activities carried on are only of a preparatory or auxiliary character, which is taken to include:  

*the use of facilities for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the company; 
*the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the company for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; 
*the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the company for the purpose of processing by another person; 
*purchasing goods or merchandise, or collecting information, for the company.

=== New logo ===
There is a new logo in the offing for Wikibooks.  Please check [[m:Wikibooks/logo|out the link]] for details and maybe make your feelings known.  It will feature in the next [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette|Gazette]].  If you didn't get the first one do [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians|sign up]] or ask someone to do it for you.

===Check this out===
I have a outline for a new Wikibook on the Middle East. Please provide feedback on what you think about this possible Wikibook. 
Here it is: [[User:Tannersf/The Middle East - outline]] 

=== Policy Proposals ===

Two new policy proposals are reaching maturity, and motions have been started to make the proposals official policy here at Wikibooks. These proposals are located at:

*[[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]]
*[[Wikibooks:Decision making/Unstable]]

All wikibookians are encouraged to read the text of the proposals, and voice their opinions on the respective talk pages.

===Checkuser Nominations===

Two users have been nominated on [[WB:RFA]] for Checkuser rights, [[User:Herbythyme|Herbythyme]] ([[User talk:Herbythyme|talk]] | [[Special:Emailuser/Herbythyme|email]] | [[Special:Contributions/Herbythyme|contribs]] | &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Log|user={{urlencode:Herbythyme}}}} &lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;logs&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;) and [[User:SBJohnny|SBJohnny]] ([[User talk:SBJohnny|talk]] | [[Special:Emailuser/SBJohnny|email]] | [[Special:Contributions/SBJohnny|contribs]] | &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Log|user={{urlencode:SBJohnny}}}} &lt;span style=&quot;color:#002bb8&quot;&gt;logs&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;). Both nominations were put forward by [[User:Herbythyme]], because the tools are needed for controlling vandalism without unintentionally blocking good-faith contributors.  The rules require there to be 25 votes in favour to grants these rights so everyone's vote really does count.

=== New Bureaucrat ===

[[User:Withinfocus]] has been promoted to the status of bureaucrat by [[User:Derbeth]]. This brings the number of currently active bureaucrats to three, along with [[User:Whiteknight]]. Bureaucrats are admins who can promote other admins.

=== What is Wikibooks? ===

A new draft version of the [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] policy is in the works. The new draft, found at [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]] contains a number of changes from the original policy, including better wording, more clarity, and a collection of new rules that have been accepted by the community in preceding months. 

This policy (WIW, for short) is one of the most important policies on wikibooks, frequently serving as the &quot;final word&quot; in disputes. People who are interested in Wikibooks policy should consider reading over the new draft, and providing opinions/questions/comments/suggestions.

=== [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks gazette]] ===

The first installment of the wikibooks newsletter, &quot;the wikibooks gazette&quot; has been sent to over 60 active wikibookians. The list of active wikibookians (and simultaneously the subscription list for the newsletter) is located at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]]. Users can add themselves to this list, or they can add other users who have been active. If users are no longer active, they can be removed from the list. 

The first issue of the newsletter was distributed by [[User:The Staff]], using a semi-automated bot program written by [[User:Whiteknight]]. [[User:The Staff]] currently does not have the bot flag, so all the newsletter deliveries are visible in the RC list.

=== Ownership Policy ===

In response to recent events, a new policy proposal, [[Wikibooks:Ownership]] has been drafted. This new policy discusses module ownership, and how people cannot exercise any sort of control over a module, simply by virtue of being an active contributor.

All wikibookians are encouraged to read this proposal, and give opinions about it on the associated talk page.

=== Policy Changes ===

Some old policy proposals have been dealt with in the last week:
*[[Wikibooks:Profanity]] was moved to &amp;#123;{[[Template:policy|policy]]}}. This policy restricts the use of inappropriate language, especially in page titles and usernames.
*[[Wikibooks:Semi-protection policy]] was moved to &amp;#123;{[[Template:obsolete|obsolete]]}}, because all the points in that policy are already covered by [[Wikibooks:Protected page]].

Several other policy proposals have been nominated for change:
*[[Wikibooks:Dispute resolution]] has been nominated for rejection because it has been superseded by [[Wikibooks:Decision making]].
*[[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] has been nominated to become &amp;#123;{[[Template:Policy|Policy]]}}.
*[[Wikibooks:Be bold]] Has been nominated to become &amp;#123;{[[Template:policy|policy]]}} because it is already a de facto staple of our project.

All wikibookians are encouraged to view these pages, and leave comments on the associated talk pages.

=== Votes for Deletion ===

At present there are quite a number of &quot;open&quot; Votes for Deletion.  They cover a wide range of subjects and the consideration and voting of any editors is encouraged.  This is an important process by which we try and maintain the high standards of Wikibooks.  Please go and '''look''' and preferably '''vote''' [[WB:VFD|here]]

=== Nominations ===

Two other users have also been nominated on [[WB:RFA]],  [[User:Withinfocus|Withinfocus]] ( [[User talk:Withinfocus|talk]] | [[Special:Emailuser/Withinfocus|email]] | [[Special:Contributions/Withinfocus|contribs]] ) has been nominated for bureaucratship, and [[User:Xania|Xania]] ( [[User talk:Xania|talk]] | [[Special:Emailuser/Xania|email]] | [[Special:Contributions/Xania|contribs]] ) received community approval and is now an administrator. Both nominations were put forward by [[User:Herbythyme]].

=== New Administrators ===

Several new [[WB:ADMIN|admins]] have recently been approved by the community:
*[[User:Swift]]
*[[User:Kellen]]
*[[User:Darklama]]
*[[User:Herbythyme]]
*[[User:Xania]]
All of these admins are active helpers who are valuable members of the wikibooks community. Also, a number of new templates have been created to add some color to the RFA process.

=== Page Edits Bot ===

[[User:Whiteknight]] has created a page-editing bot,  [[User:Wknight8111]], and has received community approval for the bot flag. The bot can perform tasks on multiple pages:
*Add categories to pages
*Add header/footer templates, and page navigation
*Convert HTML to Wiki markup
*Alter the text of pages in other ways
Ask [[User:Whiteknight]] if you would like the bot to help with your project.

=== Class Projects ===

Wikibooks is looking to improve the experience of the large class and group projects that use our server to collaboratively write texts. New class projects, especially the project leaders should read the [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] page. Also, all new class projects (and even the active old projects) should list themselves on [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]]. This way, the Wikibooks community can get involved with these projects.

== 20 November 2006 ==
=== Notification of nominations for Bureaucrats ===
This is to notify the community that I have made two nominations for bureaucrats.  It would be appreciated if you would express your views on the relevant section of [[WB:RFA#Nominations for bureaucratship]].  Thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:04, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

== 20 October 2006 ==

=== Transwiki and [[Special:Import]] ===

The [[Special:Import]] page has been activated by the developers so that we can easily import transwiki material from wikipedia. The importation process is cleaner then copy+paste, and it preserves the original page history.

Due to the effectiveness of this new policy, a new proposal has been drafted to govern it's use at:
*[[Wikibooks:Transwiki Rules]]

A motion has also been started to get the Transwiki: prefix turned into a full namespace.

=== Policy ===
The movement to improve Wikibooks' policy cannon is still in full swing, and a number of policy proposals have been decided upon recently.
#[[Wikibooks:Decision making]] '''Official Guideline'''
#[[Wikibooks:Administrators]] '''Official Policy'''
#[[Wikibooks:Be civil]] '''Official Policy'''
#[[Wikibooks:Talk page]] '''Rejected'''
#[[Wikibooks:Title pages]] '''Rejected'''
Also, the community has been acting on a &quot;Proposal of the week&quot;, in an attempt to act on some of the old proposals that have never been decided on.

=== Policy Templates ===
[[User:Swift]] has been busy reorganizing and redesigning the various templates and categories used with wikibook's policies. The templates used now are &amp;#123;{[[Template:rejected|rejected]]}}, &amp;#123;{[[Template:obsolete|obsolete]]}}, &amp;#123;{[[Template:proposed|proposed]]}}, &amp;#123;{[[Template:policy|policy]]}}, and &amp;#123;{[[Template:guideline|guideline]]}}.

=== De-adminship votes ===
Due to the new text of [[Wikibooks:Administrators]], several old administrators who have been absent for a year or more from the project have been nominated for de-adminship here. The first round of admins will be de-sysopped by 1 November

=== Book-wide search ===
New link appears in toolbox when browsing books. &quot;Search this book&quot; link leads to external Google search site allowing searching within the current book.

== 13 September 2006 ==
I created a script written in Perl that helps with creating print versions of books. Details on [[Help:Print versions#Tools|Wikibooks:Print versions]] page.

== 2 July 2006 ==
A trademark notice similar to one at Wikipedia has been added to Wikibooks [[MediaWiki:Copyright|footer]]. The Wikimedia Foundation has suggested informing that Wikipedia, Wikibooks and other project names are registered trademarks.

== 15 May 2006 ==
Wikibooks has 14,398 book modules.

=== &quot;Statistics per Wikibook&quot; from 10 May 2006 ===

The largest five &quot;books&quot; were:
# [[Programming]] (contains multiple books...)
# [[Wikiversity]] (contains multiple books...)
# [[False Friends of the Slavist]]
# [[Wikibooks Pokédex]] (but we plan to move it off Wikibooks)
# [[Radiation Oncology]]

[[Cookbook]] statistics are missing because that book now uses a separate namespace. As for the other books, much work remains to convert them to the current [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]...

== 3 May 2006 ==
Wikibooks has 14,357 book modules.

=== Wikibooks on deletion spree ===
We at Wikibooks are deleting a lot of content, especially old abandoned content that appears not to be part of a textbook. We are also building a list of books that we might want to remove from Wikibooks as we reconsider the scope of the project.

Help participate in this effort. Visit these pages:
* '''[[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]]''' &amp;ndash; several listings recently added
* '''[[Wikibooks:Books possibly in contravention with WIW]]'''

=== Wikisource abolishes reference material, source code ===
From [[s:Wikisource:News/2006-05-02/Recent vote ends excluding reference material|Wikisource:News/2006-05-02/Recent vote ends excluding reference material]]: ''As another step towards developing Wikisource's infrastructure, a [[s:Wikisource:Scriptorium/Archives/2006/04#Poll 4|recent vote]] sought to amend the project's inclusion policy to exclude all reference material (such as tables of information or source code) from the Wikisource. The vote, begun on April 11 and ended on April 27, received 8 votes to exclude, 1 neutral vote, and no votes to include. ... Wikisource's roughly [[s:Category:Deletion requests/Reference data|200 pages of reference material]] will slowly be phased out over the following months.''

Interestingly, the list of pages to delete includes [[s:Astronomical events|Astronomical events]], a collection of charts '''[[Wikibooks:Request for deletion/Juno, Moon, Ceres, Pallas, Vesta and Astronomical events|deleted from Wikibooks]]''' because there were duplicate copies at Wikibooks and Wikisource.

== 28 April 2006 ==
New proposed policy in [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]]: [[Wikibooks:General voting rules]].

== 27 April 2006 ==
I added some JavaScript from Wikipedia to our [[MediaWiki:Monobook.js]]. As result, there is a new redirect button in editbox toolbar.

If you want to adopt any features from Wikipedia to Wikibooks, write in [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:11, 27 April 2006 (UTC)

== 26 April 2006 ==
Two templates have appeared in [[Wikibooks:Template messages/Media namespace]]: {{tl|audio-nohelp}} and {{tl|listen}}. If you write a language book, remember that Wikimedia Commons hosts a lot of pronunciation audio recordings. See [[commons:Category:Pronunciation|Category:Pronunciation]].

== 24 April 2006 ==
Wikibooks has 14,276 book modules.

=== Local CheckUser status in doubt ===
Upon the [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]] page, an election for or against [[m:CheckUser|CheckUser]] statuses has continued for more than three months. Two candidates, [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] and [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]], have tried since 4 January 2006 to obtain the ability to check the Internet addresses of alleged sockpuppets and vandals. Derbeth currently has 18 votes for and 3 against. Uncle G has 14 votes for and 1 against. Though this looks good, the Wikimedia Foundation requires at least 25 affirmative votes.

[[Wikisource:User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] describes the analogous problem in a '''[[Wikisource:Wikisource:News/2006-04-19/Local CheckUser status in doubt|news story from Wikisource News]]''': &quot;It is hoped that these will allow more rapid, efficient, and informed checks than is available from the generic [[MetaWikipedia:Request for CheckUser information|Request for CheckUser information]] page on the Meta-Wiki. ... Despite prior assurances from steward [[Wikipedia:User:Datrio|Datrio]], it seems likely that the 25-support rule will be strictly enforced over Wikisource's request.&quot; Wikisource is a sister project of Wikibooks, and Pathoschild and [[Wikisource:User:Zhaladshar|Zhaladshar]] are the local candidates there.

In addition, Uncle G has [[Special:Contributions/Uncle G|not actually edited Wikibooks since 3 February 2006]] &amp;ndash; more than two months ago.

However, broad support is forming around [[MetaWikipedia:Talk:CheckUser Policy#Access (new version)|a proposal to allow wikis to borrow CheckUser users from other wikis]]. This proposal would allow the English-language editions of both Wikibooks and Wikisource to borrow two experienced CheckUsers from their sister project Wikipedia. This would require votes, but the 25-support rule would not apply.

However, the situation is set to deny CheckUser status to Derbeth, Uncle G, Pathoschild, and Zhaladshar, even though they all enjoy broad support. This has the potential to create bad feelings, accusations that the Wikimedia community favors Wikipedia, and questions from users who trust the local candidates. As mitigating factors, the process of borrowing CheckUsers is completely optional, and CheckUser is mostly about the [[MetaWikipedia:Privacy policy|Privacy policy]], not about the content of local projects.

=== Potential consensus to remove computer and video game guides ===
Some users, including Wikimedia Foundation President, [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]], have announced that Wikibooks has banned all [[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf|computer and video game books]]. Actually, it has not happened yet. For now, these walkthroughs, references, and guides remain part of Wikibooks. This appears to be a continuation of the process requested by Jimbo last year (see the 13 November 2005 entry below).

However, a consensus most probably is forming. There is no consensus on how to actually move the guides, but one method would apply a policy change to stop the creation of new computer and video game books, then existing Wikibooks would move outside the Wikimedia Foundation. [[StrategyWiki:| StrategyWiki]], a MediaWiki under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], is particular well positioned to receive most or all of the guides: they already have a [[Strategywiki:StrategyWiki:Wikibooks_Import_List|plan to import guides from Wikibooks]].

A rumour has also spread that that the computer and video game guides violate the charter of the Wikimedia Foundation, but no one has actually cited the charter nor explained the violation.

Some users also suggest that [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf|how-to guides]], [[Wikibooks:Games bookshelf|books about sports and other games]], and [[Puzzles]] will also be deleted.

== 10 April 2006 ==
The servers of Wikibooks and all Wikimedia projects were down from about 19:14, 9 April 2006, to 01:38, 10 April 2006. We are back now, and ready to continue to grow.

== 21 February 2006 ==
Wikibooks [http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/columnItem/0,294698,sid14_gci1165662,00.html has been cited] as an authoritative source of information.  Who would have thought that was possible?

[http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/business/technology/13905892.htm The Philidelphia Inquirer] has published a major article about Wikibooks and what sorts of things we are doing here, with specific mention of the FHSST involvement on Wikibooks.

[http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2006/2/6/2777 Ars Technica] has even become one site to announce a new Wikibook, becoming a significant event by itself that is newsworthy.  A new Wikibook being newsworthy?

== 12 February 2006 ==
Vote for [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote/Naming policy|proposal of naming policy]] has started. This is an important issue so please visit vote page.

== 26 January 2006 ==
We have special bot useful for changing books [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming convention]]: [[User:tsca.bot]]. If you don't want to move many pages manually, add an entry to bot's task list.

== 8 January 2006 ==
Two new templates: {{tl|cleanup-NC}} for books needing naming convention change and {{tl|cleanup-link}} for books being not linked.

== 4 January 2006 ==
[[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship#Requests for CheckUser rights|CheckUser elections]] have started. We need vote of as many users as possible, so please visit the RFA page.</text>

In order to attack the e5 pawn, White must first protect himself against the Qd4 threat (everyone must be aware that [[/5. Nxe5/]] only leads to a equal position).
:[[/5. Nc3/]] is an option but probably not the best, and anyway not the most active.
:[[/5. O-O/]] is a much more subtle way to defend against the pawn capture, as after Nxe5 Qd4 Nf3 Qxe4, White can capture the queen with Re1 (the Black Queen is pinned because it protects the king).
:[[/5. d4/]] is a way to break the center and solve matters in blood. But this variation does not seem to get good results for White.

== What's your name? ==
To ask someone else's name in Spanish, use ''[[wikt:cómo|cómo]]'', then one of the phrases in the table below (''¿Cómo te llamas?'' is &quot;What's your name?&quot; (literally How do you call yourself?). 

In Spanish, to say your name, you use the reflexive verb ''[[wikt:llamarse|llamarse]]'', which means literally ''to call oneself'' (''Me llamo Robert'' is &quot;I call myself Robert) meaning &quot;My name is Robert&quot;.
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Verb|Llamarse|To call oneself|2}}

; Notes
For some of the words above, there are two options. The one ending in &quot;o&quot; is for males, and the one ending in &quot;a&quot; is for females. It's all to do with agreement, which is covered in future chapters.

Also, there are cultural differences in how people respond to &quot;How are you?&quot;. In the U.S., we might answer &quot;Mal&quot; if we have a headache, or we're having a bad hair day. In Spanish-speaking cultures, &quot;mal&quot; would be used if a family member were very ill, or somebody lost their job.  Similarly, &quot;Fatal&quot; in the U.S. might mean a ruined manicure or a fight with one´s girlfriend, but would be reserved more for things like losing one's home in a Spanish-speaking country. 

Expressing &quot;you are welcome&quot; is more formal in Costa Rica than in other countries. Con mucho gusto is formal. Gusto is less formal. De nada, in some areas is considered slightly insulting and should not be used.

; Examples
* '''''Roberto''': Hola, Rosa. ¿Qué tal?''
*: Hello, Rose. How are you?
* '''''Rosa''': Muy bien, gracias. ¿Y tú, Roberto?''
*: Very well, thanks. And you, Robert?
* '''''Roberto''': Bien también. ¡Hasta luego!''
*: I'm good too. See you later!

== The Spanish Alphabet ==
Here is the traditional Spanish alphabet. The current Spanish alphabet is made up of the letters with numbers above them, and is also sorted in that order. Please read the notes and sections below. (Blue and red letters are a part of the normal English alphabet).

!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CFEBBE&quot;|Notes about ''Ñ''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
''N'' and ''Ñ'' are considered two different letters.  They are alphabetized as separate letters, so ''Ñ'' always comes after ''N'', regardless of where it appears in the word.  Ex: ''muñeca'' comes after ''municipal''.
|-
!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E6EBBE&quot;|Notes about ''CH'' and ''LL''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F3F5DE&quot;|
''CH'' and ''LL'' are no longer distinct letters of the alphabet. In 1994, the Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy) declared that they should be treated as [[w:Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for collation purposes. Accordingly, words beginning with ''CH'' and ''LL'' are now alphabetized under ''C'' and ''L'', respectively. In 2010, the Real Academia Española declared that CH and LL would no longer be treated as letters, bringing the total number of letters of the alphabet down to 27.
|-
!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#EBC4BE&quot;|Notes about ''K'' and ''W''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
''K'' and ''W'' are part of the alphabet but are mostly seen in foreign derived words and names, such as karate and whiskey. For instance, kilo is commonly used to refer to a kilogram.

===Consonants===
Although the above will help you understand, proper pronunciation of Spanish consonants is a bit more complicated:

Most of the consonants are pronounced as they are in American English with these exceptions:
*'''b''' like the English ''b'' at the start of a word and after ''m'' or ''n'', (IPA: /b/).  Elsewhere, especially between vowels, it is softer, often like a blend between English ''v'' and ''b''. (IPA: /β/)
*'''c''' before '''i''' and '''e''' like English ''th'' in &quot;think&quot; (in Latin America it is like English ''s'') (European IPA: /θ/; Latin American IPA: /s/)
*'''c''' before '''a''', '''o''', '''u''' and other consonants, like English ''k'' (IPA: /k/)
:*The same sound for '''e''' and '''i''' is written like '''que''' and '''qui''', where the '''u''' is silent (IPA: /ke/ and /ki/).
*'''ch''' like ''ch'' in “cheese” (IPA: /tʃ/)
*'''d''' at the start of a word and after ''n'', like English ''d'' in &quot;under&quot; (IPA: /d/)
*'''d''' between vowels (even if these vowels belong to different words)  similar to English ''th'' in &quot;mother&quot; (IPA: /ð/); at the end of words like &quot;universidad&quot; you may hear a similar sound, too.
*'''g''' before '''e''' or '''i''' like the Dutch ''g'' (IPA: /x/)
*'''g''' before '''a''', '''o''', '''u''', like ''g'' in “get” (IPA: /g/)
:*The same sound for '''e''' and '''i''' is written like '''gue''' and '''gui''', where the '''u''' is silent (IPA: /ge/ and /gi/). If the word needs the '''u''' to be pronounced, you write it with a diaeresis e.g. '''pingüino''', '''lengüeta'''.
*'''h''' is always silent (except in the digraph ''ch'')
*'''j''' like the ''h'' in hotel, or like the Scottish pronunciation of ''ch'' in &quot;loch&quot; (IPA: /h/ or /x/)
*'''ll''' is pronounced like ''gli'' in Italian &quot;famiglia,&quot; or as English y in “yes” (IPA: /ʎ/)
*'''ñ''' like nio in “onion” (or gn in French cognac) (IPA: /ɲ/)
*'''q''' like the English ''k;'' occurs only before ''ue'' or ''ui'' (IPA: /k/)
*'''r''' at the beginning of a word; after ''l'', ''n'', or ''s''; or when doubled ('''''rr'''''), it is pronounced as a full trill (IPA: /r/), elsewhere it is a single-tap trill (IPA: /ɾ/)
*'''v''' is pronounced like ''b'', there is no distinction whatsoever between B and V. (IPA: /b/)
*'''x''' is pronounced much like an English ''x'', except a little more softly, and often more like ''gs''. (IPA: /ks/)
*'''z''' like the English ''th'' (in Latin America, like the English ''s'') (European IPA: /θ/; Latin American IPA: /s/)

===Vowels===
The pronunciation of vowels is as follows:

*'''a''' [a] &quot;''La Mano''&quot; as in &quot;Kahn&quot;  (ah)
*'''e''' [e] &quot;''Mente''&quot; as in &quot;hen&quot;  (eh)
*'''i''' [i] &quot;''Sin''&quot; as the ''ea'' in &quot;lean&quot;  (e)
*'''o''' [o] &quot;''Como''&quot; as in &quot;more&quot; (without the following 'r')
*'''u''' [u] &quot;''Lunes''&quot; as in &quot;toon&quot; or &quot;loom&quot;  (oo)
The &quot;u&quot; is always silent after a g or a q (as in &quot;qué&quot; pronounced keh). 

Spanish also uses the ¨ (diaeresis) diacritic mark over the vowel u to indicate that it is pronounced separately in places where it would normally be silent. For example, in words such as ''vergüenza'' (&quot;shame&quot;) or ''pingüino'' (&quot;penguin&quot;), the u is pronounced as in the English &quot;w&quot; and so forms a diphthong with the following vowel: [we] and [wi] respectively. It is also used to preserve sound in stem changes and in commands: ''averiguar'' (to research) - '' averigüemos'' (let's research).

The '''y''' [ʝ] &quot;''Reyes''&quot; is similar to the y of &quot;yet&quot;, but more voiced (in some parts of Latin America it is pronounced as s in &quot;vision&quot; [ʒ] or sh in &quot;flash&quot; [ʃ]) At the end of a word or when it means &quot;and&quot; (&quot;''y''&quot;) it is pronounced like '''i'''.
[http://www.spanishspanish.com/alfabeto_ipower.html/ Link to audio files].

==Acute accents==
Spanish uses the ´ (Acute) diacritic mark over vowels to indicate a vocal stress on a word that would normally be stressed on another syllable; Stress is contrastive. For example, the word ''ánimo'' is normally stressed on ''a'', meaning &quot;mood, spirit.&quot; While ''animo'' is stressed on ''ni'' meaning &quot;I cheer.&quot; And ''animó'' is stressed on ''mó'' meaning &quot;he cheered.&quot; 

Additionally the acute mark is used to disambiguate certain words which would otherwise be homographs. It's used in various question word or relative pronoun pairs such as ''cómo'' (how?)&amp; ''como'' (as), ''dónde''(where?) &amp; ''donde'' (where), and some other words such as ''tú'' (you) &amp; ''tu'' (your), ''él'' (he/him) &amp; ''el'' (the).

== Articles ==
As in many languages, Spanish gives each noun a gender: '''masculine''' or '''feminine''', both for singular things and plural ones.

Spanish, like English, has two articles: the definite article (&quot;the&quot;) and the indefinite article (&quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;). However, there are 4 forms, depending on the number and gender of the noun. The plural indefinite article is &quot;some&quot; in English.

*If the noun ends in a vowel, to make it plural, '''add s''' (''gato'' - &quot;cat&quot;; ''gatos'' - &quot;cats&quot;).
*If the noun ends in a consonant, to make it plural, '''add es''' (''papel'' - &quot;paper&quot;; ''papeles'' - &quot;papers&quot;).

Happily, the gender of Spanish nouns is usually pretty easy to work out. Some very simple rules-of-thumb:
*If it ends in ''a'', ''d'', ''z'' or ''ión'': it's likely to be feminine.
*If it ends in ''o'', or a ''consonant'': it's likely to be masculine.

== Regular Verbs ==
We have already seen the present tense conjugations of two Spanish verbs, ''[[wikt:llamarse|llamarse]]'' and ''[[wikt:tener#Spanish|tener]]''. However, ''tener'' (to have) is an irregular verb. Luckily, many verbs follow an easy to understand conjugation scheme.

In Spanish, the conjugation of a regular verb depends on the ending of its infinitive. (The infinitive is the basic form of the verb that you find in the dictionary; for example, English infinitives are always written with ''to'', like the verbs ''to run'' or ''to speak''.) All Spanish infinitives end in the letter ''r'', and the three regular conjugation patterns are classified into ''-ar'', ''-er'', and ''-ir'' verbs.

Unlike English, Spanish verbs conjugate depending on the person; that is, they change depending on who is being talked about. This occurs in the English verb '''to be''' (e.g. I ''am'', you ''are'', he ''is'', etc.) but in Spanish this occurs for all persons in all verbs. As a result, pronouns are usually omitted because they can be inferred from the conjugation.

; The pronouns

|}


Spanish distinguishes between the singular '''you''' (informal ''tú'', formal ''usted'') and the plural '''you''' (informal ''vosotros'', formal ''ustedes''). Both ''tú'' and ''vosotros'' have their own conjugation patterns; ''usted'' follows the same pattern as ''él/ella'' and ''ustedes'' follows the same pattern as ''ellos''.

In Latin America, ''vosotros'' is almost unheard of, and ''ustedes'' is exclusively used instead.

''Nosotros'' (we) has a feminine ''nosotras'' that is used when the entire group is composed of females. Likewise, ''vosotros'' and ''ellos'' have feminine forms ''vosotras'' and ''ellas''.

; Notes
* There are many more &quot;-ar&quot; verbs than &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;-ir&quot;. Make sure you are most familiar with these endings.
* The second person plural is highlighted because that tense is only used in the variety of Spanish used in Spain. In other Spanish dialects the third person plural form is used instead.
* When reading texts, you will need to know the person of the verb at a glance. Notice the pattern:
*# &quot;O&quot; denotes ''I''
*# &quot;S&quot; denotes ''You''
*# A vowel that is not &quot;O&quot; denotes ''He/She/It''
*# &quot;MOS&quot; denotes ''We''
*# &quot;IS&quot; denotes ''You All''
*# &quot;N&quot; denotes ''They''

== Questions and Exclamations ==
In previous lessons, you will have noticed that we use the funny upside-down question mark &quot;[[wikt:¿|¿]]&quot;. In Spanish, questions always start with that, and finish with the regular question mark. It is the same for exclamations; the funny upside-down exclamation mark &quot;[[wikt:¡|¡]]&quot; precedes exclamations.

This happens because Spanish does not reverse the word order to ask a question. While English says ''You are here'' / ''Are you here?'', Spanish keeps the same order: ''Tú estás aquí'' / ''¿Tú estás aquí?'' Whereas the English word order alerts you since the beginning that what you are going to read is a question, Spanish offers no such initial warning. To compensate for this, Spanish adds the initial question mark, so that you'll always be able to tell a declarative statement from a question from the moment you begin reading it.

Questions in Spanish are mainly done by intonation (raising the voice at the end of the question), since questions are often identical to statements. ''Te llamas Richard'' means &quot;Your name is Richard&quot;, and ''¿Te llamas Richard?'' means &quot;Is your name Richard?&quot;.

You can also use questions words, as indicated below.

*: With whom?
* ''¿Dónde está el banco?''
*: Where is the bank?
* ''¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños?''
*: When's your birthday?
* ''¿Qué fecha es hoy?''
*: What is the date today?

;Notes

* If you refer to a group of people, you can use the plural ''quiénes''.

* ''Cuánto'' and ''cuántos'' have feminine forms ''cuánta'' and ''cuántas''.

* The archaic ''cúyo'' was used in place of ''de quién''. You may still find it in books from the early 20th century. Outside of questions, the corresponding pronoun ''cuyo'' is still used to mean '''whose''' in declarative statements. (Feminine ''cuya''; plural ''cuyos''; feminine plural ''cuyas''; this pronoun's number and gender agree with that which is possessed, not the possessor.)

* ''Cuán'' is gradually becoming archaic and being replaced by ''qué tan''.

===Notes===
*To form the numbers from thirty to one hundred, you take the multiple of ten below it, then ''[[wikt:y#Spanish|y]]'', then its units value:

&quot;54&quot; ''Cincuenta y cuatro''    Like, ''fifty and four''

&quot;72&quot; ''Setenta y dos''    Like, ''seventy and two''

&quot;87&quot; ''Ochenta y siete''    Like, ''eighty and seven''


*To say ''one hundred'' you say just ''cien'', never ''un cien''. To form the numbers from one hundred to two hundred, you turn ''cien'' into ''ciento'' before adding the rest of the number:

&quot;101&quot; ''Ciento uno''

&quot;128&quot; ''Ciento veintiocho''

&quot;150&quot; ''Ciento cincuenta''

&quot;199&quot; ''Ciento noventa y nueve''


*When used before a masculine noun, ''uno'' becomes ''un''; before a feminine noun, ''una''. To preserve the stress on the last syllable, ''veintiuno'' acquires an acute accent when it becomes ''veintiún'' before a masculine noun. Note the same mechanism in operation when writing 16 (diez + seis) = ''dieciséis'' or 22 (veinte + dos) = ''veintidós''.


* Spanish uses the long count style:

1,000,000,000 ''mil millones'' / ''un millardo'' (less common)

1,000,000,000,000 ''un billón''

1,000,000,000,000,000 ''mil billones'' / ''un billardo'' (rare)

1,000,000,000,000,000,000 ''un trillón''

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ''mil trillones'' / ''un trillardo'' (rare)

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ''un cuatrillón''


The rule of thumb is to count how many &quot;millions&quot; are in the digits:

1 (000 000) (000 000) (000 000) is ''un trillón'', because there are three (&quot;tri&quot;) multiples of millions.


* Longer numbers:

12,521,008,867,121,403,051    ''Doce trillones quinientos veintiún mil ocho billones ochocientos sesenta y siete mil ciento veintiún millones cuatrocientos tres mil cincuenta y uno''

68,076,564,322,676,958,606    ''Sesenta y ocho trillones setenta y seis mil quinientos sesenta y cuatro billones trescientos veintidós mil seiscientos setenta y seis millones novecientos cincuenta y ocho mil seiscientos seis''


Note that the words ''millones'', ''billones'', ''trillones'' are written in plural, but ''mil'' (thousand) is always kept in singular, even when counting several thousands. However, if you need to refer to an amount in several thousands without specifying how many, you can use the plural ''miles'' (''He escrito miles de cartas'' = I've written thousands of letters). For this same purpose, you can use the synonym ''millares''.

Similarly, there is the plural ''cientos'' (''He escrito cientos de cartas'' = I've written hundreds of letters). ''Centenas'' and ''centenares'' are less common synonyms for ''cientos''.

All those synonyms have forms in singular (''Un millar de cartas'' = One thousand letters; ''Una centena'' / ''Un centenar de cartas'' = One hundred letters). These synonyms are not used for actually counting, though.

There is also ''decena'', which means a group of ten.

===Examples===
* ''Tengo diecisiete gatos''
*: I have 17 cats.
* ''Hay treinta y cinco aulas''
*: There are 35 classrooms.
* ''Tengo noventa y seis primos.''
*: I have 96 cousins.
* ''Hay veintidós estudiantes en esta clase.''
*: There are 22 students in this class.
*''¡Quiero un caramelo!''
*: I want a candy!
*''¡Quiero uno!''
*: I want one!

To declare the presence or existence of something (e.g. &quot;there is,&quot; &quot;there are&quot;), Spanish uses ''hay'', which is a special conjugation of the verb ''haber'' (to have). Its past form (&quot;there was,&quot; &quot;there were&quot;) is ''hubo.'' Another form in the past (meaning roughly &quot;there used to be&quot;) is ''había''. Its future form (&quot;there will be&quot;) is ''habrá''. All these forms are invariable in singular and plural: ''Había un gato aquí'', ''Había dos gatos aquí''. Attempting to construct plural forms of them (&quot;''habían''&quot;, &quot;''habrán''&quot;) is a very common error and is severely frowned upon.

== How old are you? ==
To ask someone else's age in Spanish, use ''Cuántos años'', then one of the entries in the table below (''¿Cuántos años tienes?'' means &quot;How old are you?&quot;, or more literally, &quot;How many years do you have?&quot;)

To say your age in Spanish, you use the irregular verb ''[[wikt:tener|tener]]'' (which means &quot;to have&quot;), then your age, then ''[[wikt:año|años]]'' (which means &quot;years&quot;). For example, ''Tengo trece años'' means &quot;I have 13 years&quot; or &quot;I am 13 years old&quot;.

; Note
* &quot;Tenéis&quot; would only be used in Spain. In Latin America, one would use &quot;Tienen&quot; for both the second and third plural persons.

== What's the date today? ==
To ask for the date in Spanish, you use ''¿Cuál es la fecha?'' or ''¿Qué día es hoy?'' &lt;!-- The previous phrase given was the somewhat less common ''¿Qué fecha es hoy?'' --&gt; (meaning &quot;What is the date?&quot;, or &quot;What day is today?&quot;). In reply, you would say ''Hoy es [day of the week], [date of the month] de [month of the year]'' (For example, ''Hoy es martes veinticinco de mayo'' is &quot;Today is Tuesday, the 25th of May&quot;).

; Notes
* Neither days of the week nor months of the year are capitalised, unless at the beginning of sentences.
* On the first of the month, some Spanish speakers say ''primero'' [''First''] (''Hoy es domingo primero de enero'').
* You may still find the spelling ''setiembre'' in books from the early 20th century. It emerged from the way some countries pronounce the consonants in it. This spelling is not standard usage and you should avoid using it.

; Examples
* ''¿Qué fecha es hoy?'' (''¿A qué estamos?'' is used too.)
*: What is the date?
* ''Hoy es miércoles veintinueve de septiembre.''
*: Today is Wednesday, the 29th of September
* ''Hoy es jueves quince de agosto.''
*: Today is Thursday, the 15th of August.
* ''Hoy es sábado dos de enero.''
*: Today is Saturday, the 2nd of January.

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños?#What's the date today?|Go to the exercises]].

== When's your birthday? ==
Although ''birthday'' translates as ''cumpleaños'', they do not imply the same exact meaning. In English, ''birthday'' literally refers to the day of your birth, so it is possible to wish happy birthday to a newborn. In Spanish, ''cumpleaños'' literally means &quot;completing a year&quot; and is only used for the day in subsequent years that matches the date on which you were born. Thus, you would never say &quot;feliz cumpleaños&quot; to a newborn, since he still hasn't &quot;completed a year.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Book definition ==
* '''Scope''': This Wikibook aims to teach the Spanish language from scratch. It will cover all of the major grammar rules, moving slowly and offering exercises and plenty of examples. It's not all grammar though, as it offers vocabulary and phrases too, appealing to all learners. By the end, you should be able to read and write Spanish skilfully&lt;!-- This is NOT a typo. British English spelling is &quot;skilfully&quot;, and this book is in British English (see &quot;style&quot; below). --&gt;, though you'll need a human to help with listening and speaking.
* '''Purpose''': The purpose of this Wikibook is to teach you the Spanish language in an easy and accessible way. By the end, as mentioned, you should be a proficient reader and writer, though listening and speaking require a human tutor.
* '''Audience''': Anyone who wishes to learn Spanish, though adult and teenage learners are likely to enjoy it more. 
* '''Organization''': This Wikibook requires no prior knowledge of the subject, and all relevant terms are explained as they are encountered. The book runs chronologically from lesson 1 to lesson 2 to lesson 3 and so on until the end.
* '''Narrative''': Generally engaging and thorough, with plenty of examples and exercises to aid learning. Once concepts are introduced, they are repeated, building a base of vocabulary and grammar that will stay in your mind.
* '''Style''': This book is written in British English, and the Spanish taught is generally Iberian Spanish (called ''Castellano'' in Spain), though key Latin American differences are explained as we go along. The formatting is consistent throughout, with Spanish in italics and all tables using the same formatting. Each lesson begins with a conversation, including the key grammar and vocabulary in the lesson. At the end, there is a summary, explaining what has been achieved. Exercises are linked throughout, and each new concept or set of vocabulary is accompanied by examples, each with a translation underneath.

== Introduction ==
You are about to embark on a course learning another language, the Spanish Language!

The first lesson begins with simple greetings, and covers important ideas of the Spanish Language. Throughout education, methods of teaching Spanish have changed greatly. Years ago, the Spanish Language was taught simply by memory. Today, however, the Spanish Language is taught by moving slowly and covering grammar and spelling rules.

Again, this is an introduction. If this is the first time you are attempting to learn Spanish, do not become discouraged if you cannot understand, pronounce, or memorize some of the things discussed here.

In addition, learning a second language requires a basic understanding of your own language.  You may find, as you study Spanish, that you learn a lot about English as well.  At their core, all languages share some simple components like verbs, nouns, adjectives, and plurals.  Your first language comes naturally to you and you don't think about things like subject-verb agreement, verb conjugation, or usage of the various tenses; yet, you use these concepts on a daily basis.

While English is described as a very complicated language to learn, many of the distinguishing grammar structures have been simplified over the years.  This is not true for many other languages.  Following the grammatical conventions of Spanish will be very important, and can actually change the meaning of phrases.  You'll see what is meant by this as you learn your first verbs &lt;i&gt;ser&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;estar&lt;/i&gt;.

Do not become discouraged!  You can do it.

=== Where do you live? ===
To say you are from a country, you use ''ser'' (meaning &quot;to be [a permanent characteristic]&quot;), then ''de'' (meaning &quot;of&quot; or &quot;from&quot;), then the country or place. To say you are currently living in a place or country, you use ''vivir'' (meaning &quot;to live&quot;), then ''en'' (meaning &quot;in&quot;), then the country or place.

To ask where someone else lives, you use ''Dónde'' then ''vivir'' (''¿Dónde vives?'' means &quot;Where do you live?&quot;). To ask where someone is from, you use ''De dónde'', then ''ser'' (''¿De dónde eres?'' means &quot;Where are you from?&quot;).

While ''vivir'' is totally regular (vivo, vives, vive, vivimos, vivís, viven), ''ser'' is about as irregular as they come. It is conjugated below.

; Examples
* ''Vivo en Inglaterra''
*: I live in England.
* ''Son de España, pero viven en Alemania.''
*: They are from Spain, but they live in Germany.

=== The compass ===
[[File:RoseSimple_es.pdf|thump]]

; Examples
* ''Vivo en el suroeste de México.''
*: I live in the Southwest of Mexico.
* ''Soy del norte de Australia.''
*: I'm from the north of Australia.

; Notes

* ''Noreste'' has a variant ''nordeste''. ''Sureste'' and ''suroeste'' have, respectively, variants ''sudeste'' and ''sudoeste''.

* ''Oeste'' has a synonym ''occidente'' which is used with the same frequency. The corresponding synonym of ''este'' is ''oriente''. You can also use them in compounds like ''nororiente'', ''noroccidente'', ''suroriente''/''sudoriente'' and ''suroccidente''/''sudoccidente''.

* Their corresponding adjectives are ''septentrional'' ('''northern'''), ''meridional'' ('''southern'''), ''oriental'' ('''eastern'''), ''occidental'' ('''western'''). Compound adjectives like ''noroccidental'' and ''sudoriental'' are also possible.

* The adjectives ''norteño'' ('''northern''') and ''sureño'' ('''southern''') do not refer to geographical positions but to someone's regional origin.

* Archaic usage had ''septentrión'' to mean '''north''' and ''mediodía'' to mean '''south'''. Some older books may still use them. Today, ''septentrión'' is no longer used, and ''mediodía'' means ''noon''.

== Housing ==
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|Casas|Houses|2}}

|-
| A house
| Una casa
|-
| A detached house
| Una casa individual
|-
| A semi-detached house
| Una casa pareado 
|-
| A terraced house
| Una casa adosada
|-
| A flat
| Un piso
|-
| A bungalow
| Un bungalow
|-
| A room
| Una habitación
|}

; Note
The singular is ''una habitación'', but the plural is ''unas habitaciones'' (without the accent)
*This is a general rule, because in the singular, the the 'ó' shows the sound is to be emphasized, but for plural the 's' has also to be heard, so it is written as it is spoken, as 'o' without the accent).

; Examples
* ''Vivo en un piso.''
*: I live in a flat.
* ''Vivo en una casa adosada en Canadá.''
*: I live in a semi-detatched house in Canada.
* ''Vive en un bungalow que tiene diez habitaciones.''
*: He lives in a bungalow that has ten rooms.

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Dónde vives?#Housing|Go to the exercises]].

== Adjectives ==
As we already learnt, Spanish nouns each have a gender. This doesn't just affect the article, but the adjective; it has to ''agree''. Also, adjectives go after the noun, not before it.

If the adjective (in its natural form - the form found in the dictionary), ends in an &quot;O&quot; or an &quot;A&quot;, then you remove that vowel and add...
{| style=&quot;float:right&quot;
| [[Image:Male.png|thumb|155px|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''O''' or '''OS'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;]]
| [[Image:Female.png|thumb|125px|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''A''' or '''AS'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;]]
|}
* ''O'' for masculine singular nouns
* ''OS'' for masculine plural nouns
* ''A'' for feminine singular nouns
* ''AS'' for feminine plural nouns.

; Examples
* ''Un hombre bueno''
*: A good man
* ''Unos hombres buenos''
*: Some good men
* ''Una mujer buena''
*: A good woman
* ''Unas mujeres buenas''
*: Some good women

The masculine O / feminine A rule is applicable to the vast majority of Spanish nouns. There are a handful of exceptions, though, but you'll get to memorize them.

|-
| Quiet
| Tranquilo/a
|-
| Boring
| Aburrido/a
|-
| Noisy
| Ruidoso/a
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

; Examples
* ''La ciudad es ruidosa.''
*: The city is noisy.
* ''El campo es aburrido.''
*: The countryside is boring.''
* ''Lo bueno de la ciudad es que hay mucho que hacer.''
*: The good thing about the city is that there are lots of the things to do.
* ''Lo malo de la ciudad es que no quedan plantas.''
*: The bad thing about the city is that there isn't any foliage.


''Lo'' is the only Spanish word classified as neuter gender (although it is always accompanied by masculine adjectives). It is an unusual article that does not carry a noun, and is used to build sentences like ''esto es lo que yo quiero'' (this is what I want) and ''haz lo correcto'' (do the right thing).

| name = Rose
| image = Rose hip.JPG
| description = The rose is a common garden shrub, but it also grows wild in many places.  The leaves of most species are 5–15 cm long, pinnate, with 3–13 leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. The vast majority of roses are deciduous, but a few (particularly in southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.
| range = There are more than a hundred species of wild roses, all from the northern hemisphere and mostly from temperate regions.
| seasons = Fall
| use = The fruit of the rose bush (rose hips) are sometimes eaten, mainly for their vitamin C content. They are usually pressed and filtered to make rose-hip '''syrup''', as the fine hairs surrounding the seeds are unpleasant to eat (resembling itching powder). They can also be used to make herbal '''tea''', '''jam''', '''jelly''' and '''marmalade'''.  They are also used to make '''pies''' and '''bread'''.

;name: The common name of the plant
;binomial: The Latin name of the Genus (capitalize the first letter) and species (all lower case).  Optional.
;image: A link to a photograph or drawing of the plant.  It should serve as an effective method of identifying the plant.
;image_caption: The caption that will appear beneath the image.  Often the Latin name.
;image2: A second image (optional)
;image_caption2: A caption for the second image
;description: A physical description of the plant, useful in identifying it.  Point out features that will help a person distinguish it from another plant.
;range: Where the plant may be found.  Include its habitat (moist woods, open fields) as well as the region (Eastern North America) where it may be found.
;seasons: A description of when the edible part(s) of the plant may be gathered (e.g. Early Fall through Early Spring).
;use: Describe which part of the plant is edible, and brief instructions for preparing it.
;warning: Include any information a person would need to be aware of before ingesting this plant.  Especially if the plant contains poisonous parts that should be avoided, or if the edible part is poisonous at other times of the year.  This is also a good place to describe similar, but poisonous plants, and how to distinguish them.

Here's how:

I'm curious; has anything happened since you edited Notes for Contributors? It's been a while: has the 1.0 come out? Did you ever get a skeleton VC mode written? --[[User talk:Gwern |Gwern]] [[Special:Contributions/Gwern | (contribs)]] 03:29, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== CMS File Reference ==

The CMS model format is deprecated. This means that its usage is discouraged and that it is likely to go away in a future version of Celestia.

=== What's a CMS file? ===

&quot;&lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;elestia? &lt;u&gt;M&lt;/u&gt;odel? &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;imple?&quot; files define simple shapes by deforming a sphere. Although deprecated, they are still used for a few generic objects such as asteroids, minor moons and the like.

They lie in the &quot;models&quot; directory of the [[Celestia]] root, or in an add-on's root subdirectory (itself in Celestia's &quot;extra&quot; directory).

They are plain text files, and can thus be modified with your favourite text editor.

=== # ===

The pound sign begins a comment: whatever lies after this sign up to the next carriage return is ignored by Celestia.

=== &quot;SphereDisplacementMesh&quot; { ... } ===

All of the cms stuff is within this block. The parameters appearing within the accolades are:

==== &quot;Size [ &lt;tt&gt;x y z&lt;/tt&gt; ]&quot; ====
When a model is placed in a circular orbit around a parent body without rotation settings (so it is tide-locked) and with a mean longitude of 0,
* x is the radial axis (running from the parent body to the model and through it: near-far)
* y is the polar axis (running perpendicular to the orbital plane: north-south)
* z is the orbital axis (running parallel to the orbit: forward-backward)

It defaults to &lt;tt&gt;[1.0 1.0 1.0]&lt;/tt&gt;.

==== &quot;NoiseOffset [ &lt;tt&gt;a b c&lt;/tt&gt; ]&quot; ====
This is some kind of implementation of Perlin noise, and NoiseOffset (probably) moves the origin of the noise.

It defaults to &lt;tt&gt;[10 10 10]&lt;/tt&gt;.

==== &quot;FeatureHeight &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ====
This controls the height of the bumps. Small numbers like 0.2 define a body that is roughly spherical with low hills, while larger numbers like 1.0 define a body with large hills.

It defaults to &lt;tt&gt;0.0&lt;/tt&gt;.

==== &quot;Octaves &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ====
This defines the bumpiness of the model. Small values like 1 define a body with a fairly regular distortion, whereas large values like 9 define a very bumpy body. A value of zero gives a spherical body.

It defaults to &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;.

==== &quot;Slices &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ====
Together with Rings, this defines how much detail there is in the mesh. The default value of &lt;tt&gt;20&lt;/tt&gt; defines a blocky mesh, while 200 defines a much smoother mesh that can take several seconds to render when displayed for the first time.

Setting Slices to a low value and Rings to a high value gives a mesh that is shaped like a peeled orange. (The Slices parameter controls the number of longitude lines)

==== &quot;Rings &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; ====
Together with Slices, this defines how much detail there is in the mesh. It also defaults to &lt;tt&gt;20&lt;/tt&gt;.

Setting Slices to a high value and Rings to a low value gives a mesh that is shaped like a pile of doughnuts of varying thicknesses stacked on each other. (The Rings parameters controls the number of latitude lines)

Moves : 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 b5 8.e5

A logical move which wants to attack the Black knight. Indeed this knignt seems to be immobilized by the White bishop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transportation may be the most crucial necessity for living on a man-made island. It allows construction materials, food, and other items to be imported, grants you a means of escape from storms or attack, and most importantly, gets you to your island in the first place.

==Ships &amp; Boats==
Ships and Boats will probably make up the basic transit system of your island, used for transporting people and cargoes through the waters around you. Canoes are cheap and practical. They are manually operated, so you need not worry about paying for fuel. Also, they are lightweight and could be stored on your island to protect them if a storm comes. Canoes can carry multiple people and items, thus making them perfect for preforming tasks like aquaculture or fishing.
Ships are larger, generally require fuel, and are much more cumbersome, however, if you have a larger island, with multiple citizens and a greater need for supplies, it is more logical to use ships.

==Specializing Watercraft==
You may require specialized craft for a certain function, such as trawlers, freighters, nuclear submarines, or ferries.
Speeders are probably the best choice for carrying one or two people around the outskirts of your waters quickly, but are expensive. Kayaks are a cheaper but less effective alternative. If you plan to carry large amounts of minerals from your island for trade, it may be good to purchase a small freighter. If your island is not far from another landmass, and receives tourism, or if you/your citizens must commute to another landmass regularly, it may be in your best interest to purchase a ferry or make one. Since they are not meant for long journeys or to carry equipment they may be as simple as a primitive raft. 
Your island may also need ship specialized towards defense, especially if your location is heavily pirated. If you have a wealthy micronation, you may be able to afford some gunboats or other military material. Other than that, armed vehicles will most likely consist of boats with armed people on them.

==Aircraft==
If you have an island far from any human outpost, Aircraft may be critical to your island's survival. But they are painfully costly. Just the vehicle itself can cost several hundred thousand dollars at best. Not to mention fuel, safety equipment, and a pilot/flying class. If you have the means, however, aeronautics can provide a myriad of opportunities to your island. you can travel to other places, transport supplies,export your island's goods, and launch nuclear strikes at any entity that does not recognize your island's sovereignty. They travel faster than watercraft, but cannot carry as much.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section provides for determining for the purposes of corporation tax the amount of the profits attributable to a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom of a company that is not resident in the United Kingdom (&quot;the non-resident company&quot;).
 
There shall be attributed to the permanent establishment the profits it would have made if it were a distinct and separate enterprise, engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, dealing wholly independently with the non-resident company.

It is assumed that the permanent establishment has the same credit rating as the non-resident company, and that the permanent establishment has such equity and loan capital as it could reasonably be expected to have in the circumstances specified in that subsection. No deduction may be made in respect of costs in excess of those that would have been incurred on those assumptions. 

Deductions are allowed for allowable expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. For these purposes &quot;allowable expenses&quot; means expenses of a kind in respect of which a deduction would be allowed for corporation tax purposes if incurred by a company resident in the United Kingdom.

The Board of HM Revenue and Customs may by regulations make additional provision concerning how to apply the rules for insurance companies.

This section also introduces [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule A1 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A1 to the Act]].

At this point, you should know how to do some simple interaction with the user. But without conditions or loops, your programs can only follow one simple pattern.

One fundamental capability of any programming language is conditions. A condition statement, such as an ''if statement'', causes different code to run depending on whether a condition is true or false. if statements will be introduced in the following section.

Another important ability is a loop. It's often necessary to make one section of code run multiple times. The ''foreach'', ''for'' and ''while'' loops allow this. They will be introduced later in this chapter.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Conversion of Dv Avi file into the ogg theora video file using windows

The free software to convert videos into the Ogg Theora Format is called &quot;ffmpeg2theora&quot;, you can download it here.
http://www.v2v.cc/%7ej/ffmpeg2theora/download.html

You must have the program 'ffmpeg2theora' in the same folder as the video (video.dv or video.avi) that you want to convert (copy-past or drag and drop it in the right location).

Then you must start the Command Prompt', you can find it under : Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Command Prompt.

Imagine the where the video that you want to convert is on your harddrive with the name &quot;E:&quot; in a folder called &quot;umwandeln&quot;.

You can navigate to the right harddisk by using commands like &quot;E:&quot; and Enter
You can navigate to the right folder by using the &quot;cd&quot; command, for example: &quot;cd umwandeln&quot; and Enter (cd stands for 'change directory')

Other help:
The command 'dir' shows a list of the content of that folder (directory)

The command 'cd ..' moves you up to one folder level


Then, you can start the conversion by giving the command:

&quot;ffmpeg2theora -p pro video.dv&quot; (or .avi) and Enter:

After some time, depending on your hardware, the ogg video is ready and available in the same folder.


Notes:

It is possible to create ogg videos in a lower quality, for example the preview version, the command for that is:
&quot;ffmpeg2theora -p preview video.dv&quot;.
Next to that, it is also possible to code the video in a diffent quality, e.g.: Video Quality 7 and Audio Quality 3,
then you use the command: &quot;ffmpeg2theora -v 7 -a 3 video.dv&quot;

ffmpeg2theora -p pro video.dv -&gt; Video: 720x576 if fps ~ 25, 720x480 if fps ~ 30 Quality 7 - Sharpness 0 Audio: Max 2 channels - Quality 3

ffmpeg2theora -p preview video.dv -&gt; Video: 384x288 if fps ~ 25, 320x240 if fps ~ 30 Quality 5 - Sharpness 2 Audio: Max 2 channels - Quality 1

The command &quot;ffmpeg2theora -h&quot; gives a list of the possible output parameters that can be used.

This article contains some frequently-asked questions (FAQs) regarding Fortran and their answers.

==Q. Should I learn Fortran? Is it obsolete?==

A: Fortran is a good language for scientific programming, because it is fast, is good at handling arrays, is standardized, is portable, and because many high-quality libraries of numerical algorithms exist. The language itself is also maintained; the latest version of the Fortran language is Fortran 2008 (approved by ISO/IEC in September 2010).

==Q: What Fortran compiler should I use?==

A: Oracle Solaris Studio, GNU Fortran, G95, and Silverfrost (Windows only) are free software Fortran 95 compilers, and Absoft, IBM, Intel, Lahey, NAG, Pathscale and PGI sell Fortran compilers. Comparative information on Fortran compilers from Polyhedron Software is available at http://www.polyhedron.com/compare0html .

==Q: How do I create numbered file names such as out_01.txt, out_02.txt etc.?==

A: Use an &quot;internal write&quot; to create the file names, for example
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
write (file_name,&quot;('out_',i2.2,'.txt')&quot;) i
&lt;/source&gt;

A: A neater way to do this would be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
i=&lt;file number&gt;
WRITE(file_name, fmt = '(A4,I0,A4)')'out_',i,'.txt'
&lt;/source&gt;

This way the formatting is clear and you are writing the correct string to the variable. I assume you wanted an integer as the number. 'I' format statement requires an Integer length, or zero in some cases. You are probably thinking of F where the decimal point denotes the number of decimals to consider.

==Q: What does the open statement look like using this technique? OPEN(UNIT = __, FILE = ???, STATUS='NEW')?==

A: Gfortran does not accept this block

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
      write(file_name,'cp',(i5.5),'.out') ITN
      open  (67,file = file_name)
&lt;/source&gt;

Gives, ERROR, file tag must be of type CHARACTER

Can someone else help with this?

A: See the answer above. Basically the way you have written the variable file_name is incorrect.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
WRITE(file_name,fmt='(A2,I0,A4)')'cp',ITN,'.out'
OPEN(UNIT=67, file=file_name, status='new')
&lt;/source&gt;

Assuming that ITN has been declared as an integer and given a value.

==Q: How can I convert a string to an integer and other types? What about the reverse?==

A: Use an &quot;internal read&quot; or &quot;internal write&quot;. In effect, you use a character variable as the file name and read or write the I/O list. You write things like

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   read (character_variable, format) list of variables 
&lt;/source&gt;
   
to convert a string to another type and 

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
   write (character_variable, format) list of variables
&lt;/source&gt;

to convert to a string from another type, as demonstrated by the following program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program xconvert_integer_string   
character(20) :: cnum 
integer       :: i 
i = 445 
write(cnum,'(i5)') i 
write(*,'(a)') trim(cnum) ! should output &quot;  445&quot; 
write(cnum,'(i5.5)') i 
write(*,'(a)') trim(cnum) ! should output &quot;00445&quot; 
i = 34 
write(cnum,'(i0)') i 
write(*,'(a)') trim(cnum) ! should output &quot;34&quot; 
end program xconvert_integer_string
&lt;/source&gt;

This answer is based on messages in comp.lang.fortran by Paul van Delst and Dick Hendrickson.

==Q. How do I issue a command to the operating system within a Fortran program?==

A. There is no standard way to do this in Fortran, but many compilers have an extension named &quot;system&quot; or something similar. Please consult the documentation of your compiler. In Fortran 2003, one can call C code, and it is possible to call the operating system from C.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Texas Hold 'em, while seeming easy to learn, is in reality a subtle game and it takes quite a while to  master.  To win or at least stay even over the long run, beginners should play a '''''very''''' tight game (play very few hands they are dealt, 10-15% at most) at first.  If all of the guidelines below are followed and a person keeps studying, at some point everything will 'click' and the person will understand the game enough to work on becoming an advanced player.  At that time, players can easily adjust their playing styles and tactics outside of the general guidelines shown in this guide and '''''will assuredly''''' do quite well.

It is '''''very strongly suggested''''' that players restrict themselves to low-limit games ($3/$6 and lower) until they become more familiar with the subtleties of this game and have learned positional play as well as being able to determine what possible hands other players have.  No limit Hold 'em is very exciting yet can will easily cause a player to become broke after making only one mistake.

One good way to get many practice hands is for the reader to play at one of the online poker sites that have free chips for players to use in games.  But, keep in mind that online free chip play is '''''very different from cash play''''' because many of the players aren't playing seriously.  But, being able to play 1 or more fast games at a time will help you become more familiar with Texas Hole em.

''It is assumed that the reader understands basic poker and hand rankings.''

== Traits of good players ==

These traits cannot be avoided.  '''''They are all essential to a winning strategy'''''.

Good players watch other opponents to help get insight as to what they are doing and what cards they have.

Good players are '''''extremely''''' patient and wait for profitable situations to occur.  If the hand is bad, they fold, they do not rely on hunches or luck.

Good players are aggressive.  When they have a good situation, they raise the profit by increasing the amount of $ in the pot by betting.

Good players are not afraid to try to win even though it appears there may be an opposing better hand.  If the odds are right, getting rid of opponents who may possibly have a better hand isn't something to avoid.

Good players constantly try to improve their skills.

The above guidelines '''''must''''' be followed even for advanced players.

== Rules of the game ==

Two cards are dealt to each player.  These are considered 'hole cards'.  They are the only cards in the game that are unseen by other players.

The cards are dealt clockwise from the position of the current dealer.  The dealer position moves clockwise to the next player after each hand dealt.

There isn't an ante in most Hold 'Em games, the person to the immediate left of the dealer adds an automatic bet equal to the minimum bet for that game.  For instance, if the game rules are $3/6 limit, the immediate left player would put in $6.  He is referred to as the Big Blind.

The player to the left of the Big Blind is the Small Blind.  His automatic bet is almost always 1/2 of the Big Blind (ie: if the game is $3/6 limit, his automatic bet will be $3).

== Position ==
Player position is determined in regard to where the player is in relation to the Big and Small blinds ('''''BB''''' and '''''sB''''' respectively).  For the purposes here, it is assumed that the table is full with 10 people playing.  The '''''Button''''' is the to the right of the BB and the person playing from there bets after everyone else.

[[File:Texas Hold'em Poker Table with Blinds.svg|400px|thumb|center|A standard hold 'em game with the blinds]]

=== Pre-flop ===

''Fold all hands that do not apply to your position if you must put money in.  This is extremely important.  By playing a smaller field of cards as a beginner, you will save yourself quite a bit of grief.''

==== Early Position ====
A player who is in the first player to the left of the BB is considered to be 'under the gun' (UTG).  He has a very extreme disadvantage due to the fact that he has to make decisions before he can see what all of the other players are going to do regarding checking or raising.  This also applies to the player to the immediate left of the UTG player.  Together, they are considered to be in Early position and should be played similarly.

A beginning player is advised to '''only''' bet AA, KK, QQ, and AK (suited or unsuited) from the early position.  All other hands are very vulnerable and will lose more often than they win.  Betting other hands will result in lost money ''over the long run'' due to the fact that others are in a better position and can raise a much wider variety of starting hands.  When a player becomes more advanced with time and practice, other hands can be played depending on the types of other players in any particular game.

''Check all hands besides the ones listed above and fold if someone after you bets''.

==== Middle Position ====

The middle position is considered to be the 3 seats to the left of early position.  Here, you can play a few more hands due to the fact that you can see what players behind you (to the right) are doing.

In addition to the first position cards AA-QQ and AK, you can bet (call if a raise is made before you):

Any Ace with a face card of the same suit as well as ATs.
KQs, QJs, JJ, TT, AQ-Js are strong cards as well.

==== Late Position ====

The last 3 seats before the BB and sB are considered late position.  From here you can see quite a bit of information about what other players have and can play a large variety of cards.

Hands to raise if no one else has raised (call if someone has raised):

AA-77, AK-A8, KQ-KTs, KQ-KJ.

==== The dealer button (late-late position) ====

Here you can play AA-22, AA-2s, AK-A5, KQ-K9

== Betting ==

To win in holdem, you want to win big pots, not a bunch of small ones.  Chasing a lot of small pots is more expensive in the long run than the return.  (Exceptions exist such as 'stealing the blinds')  If you are winning a lot of small pots, you are playing too many of them and will eventually lose all of your money.</text>

== Introduction ==
Tourism is the act of travel for predominantly recreational or leisure purposes, and also refers to the provision of services in support of this act. According to the World Tourism Organization, tourists are people who &quot;travel to and stay in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes not related to the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited&quot;.

Tourism, however long its incident duration, has become an extremely popular, global activity. In 2004, there were over 763 million international tourist arrivals.[1]

As a service industry, tourism has numerous tangible and intangible elements. Major tangible elements include transportation, accommodation, and other components of a hospitality industry. Major intangible elements relate to the purpose or motivation for becoming a tourist, such as rest, relaxation, the opportunity to meet new people and experience other cultures, or simply to do something different and have an adventure.

Tourism is vital for many countries, due to the income generated by the consumption of goods and services by tourists, the taxes levied on businesses in the tourism industry, and the opportunity for employment and economic advancement by working in the industry. For these reasons NGOs and government agencies may sometimes promote a specific region as a tourist destination, and support the development of a tourism industry in that area. The contemporary phenomenon of mass tourism may sometimes result in overdevelopment, however alternative forms of tourism such as ecotourism seek to avoid such outcomes by pursuing tourism in a sustainable way.

The terms tourism and travel are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context travel has a similar definition to tourism, but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms tourism and tourist are sometimes used pejoratively to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited by tourists.



One of the earliest definitions of tourism was provided by the Austrian economist Hermann Von Schullard in 1910, who defined it as, &quot;sum total of operators, mainly of an economic nature, which directly relate to the entry, stay and movement of foreigners inside and outside a certain country, city or a region.&quot;

Hunziker and Krapf, in 1941, defined tourism as &quot;the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, in so far as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity.&quot;[2]

In 1976 Tourism Society of England defined it as &quot;Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destination outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes.&quot;

In 1981 International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined Tourism in terms of particular activities selected by choice and undertaken outside the home environment.

===United Nations definition===

United Nations classified 3 forms of tourism in 1994 in its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics as follows:

# Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country;
# Inbound tourism, involving non-residents traveling in the given country;
# Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country.

UN also derived different categories of tourism by combining the 3 basic forms of tourism:

#Internal tourism, which comprises domestic tourism and inbound tourism;
#National tourism, which comprises domestic tourism and outbound tourism;
#International tourism, which consists of inbound tourism and outbound tourism.

===New definition===

Intrabound tourism is a new academic terminology coined by the Korea Tourism Organization and widely accepted in Korea. Intrabound tourism differs from ‘domestic tourism’ in that the former is more concerned with making and implementation of national tourism policies in consideration of the tourism ecosystem consisting of inbound, outbound and intrabound tourism.

Entering into 21st century, the tourism industry has undergone a paradigm shift form the promotion of inbound tourism to the promotion of intrabound tourism since many countries are experiencing a tough competition for inbound tourists. Also realizing that it is impossible to advance the inbound tourism in the absence of active intrabound tourism, national policy makers have shifted their policy priority onto the promotion of intrabound tourism such as the promotion of local tourism to contribute to the local economy.

Examples of such policies are “See America,” “Getting Going Canada,” and “See Korea Campaign”. Taking a Korean case as an example, Korea Tourism Organization has recently launched a nation-wide campaign to promote intrabound tourism, named “Guseok Guseok, literally meaning corner to corner.

===Prerequisites of tourism===

Before people are able to experience tourism they usually need at least:

# disposable income, i.e. money to spend on non-essentials
# leisure time
# tourism infrastructure, such as transport and accommodation

Individually, sufficient health is also a condition, and of course the inclination to travel. Furthermore, in some countries there are legal restrictions on travelling, especially abroad. Certain states with strong governmental control over the lives of citizens (notably established Communist states) may restrict foreign travel only to trustworthy citizens. The United States prohibits its citizens from traveling to some countries, for example, Cuba.

== History ==
Wealthy people have always travelled to distant parts of the world to see great buildings or other works of art, to learn new languages, to experience new cultures, or to taste new cuisine. As long ago as the time of the Roman Republic places such as Baiae were popular coastal resorts for the rich.

The terms tourist and tourism were first used as official terms in 1937 by the League of Nations. Tourism was defined as people travelling abroad for periods of over 24 hours.

== Health tourism &amp; leisure travel ==
The history of European tourism can perhaps be said to originate with the medieval pilgrimage. Although undertaken primarily for religious reasons, the pilgrims in the Canterbury Tales quite clearly saw the experience as a kind of holiday (the term itself being derived from the 'holy day' leisure activities). Pilgrimages created a variety of tourist aspects that still exist - bringing back souvenirs, obtaining credit with foreign banks (in medieval times utilising international networks established by Jews and Lombards), and making use of space available on existing forms of transport (such as the use of medieval English wine ships bound for Vigo by pilgrims to Santiago De Compostela). Pilgrimages are still important in modern tourism - such as to Lourdes or Knock in Ireland. But there are modern equivalents - Graceland and the grave of Jim Morrison in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

During the seventeenth century, it became fashionable in England to undertake a Grand Tour. The sons of the nobility and gentry were sent upon an extended tour of Europe as an educational experience. The eighteenth century was the golden age of the Grand Tour, and many of the fashionable visitors were painted at Rome by Pompeo Batoni. A modern equivalent of the Grand Tour is the phenomenon of the backpacker, although cultural holidays, such as those offered by Swann-Hellenic, are also important.

Health tourism has always existed, but it was not until the eighteenth century that it became important. In England, it was associated with spas, places with supposedly health-giving mineral waters, treating diseases from gout to liver disorders and bronchitis. Bath was the most fashionable resort, but Buxton, Harrogate, and Tunbridge Wells, amongst others, also flourished. Of course, people visited these places for the balls and other entertainments, just as much as 'the waters'. Continental Spas such as Karlsbad attracted many fashionable travellers by the nineteenth century.

It could be argued that Britain was the home of the seaside holiday. In travelling to the coast, the population was following in the steps of Royalty. King George III made regular visits to Weymouth when in poor health. At the time, a number of doctors argued the benefits of bathing in sea water, and sea bathing as a widespread practice was popularised by the Prince Regent (later George IV), who frequented Brighton for this purpose.

Leisure travel was associated with the industrialization of United Kingdom – the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population. Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, the factory owners, and the traders. These comprised the new middle class. Cox &amp; Kings were the first official travel company to be formed in 1758. Later, the working class could take advantage of leisure time.

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. At Nice, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the French Riviera, the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the Promenade des Anglais; in many other historic resorts in continental Europe, old well-established palace hotels have names like the Hotel Bristol, the Hotel Carlton or the Hotel Majestic - reflecting the dominance of English customers.

=== Winter tourism ===
Winter sports were largely invented by the British leisured classes, initially at the Swiss village of Zermatt (Valais), and St Moritz in 1864. The first packaged winter sports holidays took place in 1902 at Adelboden, Switzerland. Winter sports were a natural answer for a leisured class looking for amusement during the coldest season.

Organized sport was well established in Britain before it reached other countries. The vocabulary of sport bears witness to this: rugby, football, and boxing all originated in Britain, and even tennis, originally a French sport, was formalized and codified by the British, who hosted the first national championship in the nineteenth century, at Wimbledon.

=== Mass travel ===
Mass travel could only develop with two crucial features:

# improvements in technology allowed the transport of large numbers of people in a short space of time to places of leisure interest, and
# greater numbers of people began to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

The pioneer of modern mass tourism was Thomas Cook who, on 5 July 1841, organized the first package tour in history. He arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person for a group of 570 temperance campaigners from Leicester to a rally in Loughborough, eleven miles away. Cook was paid a share of the fares actually charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price. There had been railway excursions before, but this one included entrance to an entertainment held in private grounds, rail tickets and food for the train journey. Cook immediately saw the potential of a convenient 'off the peg' holiday product in which everything was included in one cost. He organised packages inclusive of accommodation for the Great Exhibition, and afterwards pioneered package holidays in both Britain (particularly in Scotland) and on the European continent (where Paris and the Alps were the most popular destinations).

He was soon followed by others (the Polytechnic Touring Association, Dean and Dawson etc.), with the result that the tourist industry developed rapidly in late Victorian Britain. Initially it was supported by the growing middle classes, who had time off from their work, and who could afford the luxury of travel and possibly even staying for periods of time in boarding houses.

The Bank Holidays Act 1871 introduced a statutory right for workers to take holidays, even if they were not paid at the time. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the tradition of the working class holiday had become firmly established in Britain. These were largely focussed upon the seaside resorts.

The spread of the railway network in the nineteenth century resulted in the growth of Britain's seaside towns by bringing them within easy distance of Britain's urban centres. Blackpool was created by the construction of a line to Fleetwood, and some resorts were promoted by the railway companies themselves - Morecambe by the Midland Railway and Cleethorpes by the Great Central Railway. Other resorts included Scarborough in Yorkshire, servicing Leeds and Bradford; Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, catering for the inhabitants of Bristol; and Skegness, patronised by the residents of the industrial East Midlands. The cockneys of London flocked to Southend-on-Sea, mainly by Thames Steamer, and the South Coast resorts such as Broadstairs, Brighton, and Eastbourne were only a train ride away, with others further afield such as Bournemouth, Bognor Regis and Weymouth.

For a century, domestic tourism was the norm, with foreign travel being reserved for the rich or the culturally curious. A number of inland destinations, such as the English Lake District, and Snowdonia appealed to those who liked the countryside and fine scenery. The holiday camp began to appear in the 1930s, but this phenomenon really expanded in the post-war period. Butlins and Pontins set this trend, but their popularity waned with the rise of overseas package tours and the increasing comforts to which visitors became accustomed at home. Towards the end of the 20th century this market has been revived by the upmarket inland resorts of Dutch company Center Parcs.

Cox &amp; Co, the forebear of Cox &amp; Kings were in existence from 1758 largely entwined with the travel arrangements for the British Army serving around the Empire. While acting as 'agents' for various regiments, they organised the payment, provision, clothing and travel arrangements for members of the armed forces. In the 19th century their network of offices contained a banking and also travel department. The company became heavily involved with affairs in India and its Shipping Agency had offices in France and the Middle East.

Other phenomena that helped develop the travel industry were paid holidays:

* 1.5 million manual workers in Britain had paid holidays by 1925
* 11 million by 1939 (30% of the population in families with paid holidays)

=== Outside Britain ===
In the USA, the first great seaside resort, in the European style, was Atlantic City, New Jersey.

In continental Europe, early resorts included Ostend (for the people of Brussels), and Boulogne-sur-Mer (Pas-de-Calais) and Deauville (Calvados) (for Parisians).

=== International mass tourism ===
Increasing speed on railways meant that the tourist industry could develop internationally.

To this may be added the development of sea travel. By 1901, the number of people crossing the English Channel from England to France or Belgium had passed 0.5 million per year. Shipping companies were anxious to fill cabin space that was under utilised. For example, P&amp;O found that the majority of their passengers for India and the Far East joined the ship at Marseilles. Consequently, they marketed holidays based upon sea trips from London to Lisbon and Gibraltar. Other companies diverted their older ships to operate cruises in the summer months.

However, the real age of international mass travel began with the growth of air travel after World War Two. In the immediate post-war period, there was a surplus of transport aircraft, such as the popular and reliable Douglas Dakota, and a number of ex military pilots ready to fly them. They were available for charter flights, and tour operators began to use them for European destinations, such as Paris and Ostend.

Vladimir Raitz pioneered modern package tourism when on 20 May 1950 his recently founded company, Horizon, provided arrangements for a two-week holiday in Corsica. For an all inclusive price of £32.10s.-, holiday makers could sleep under canvas, sample local wines and eat a meal containing meat twice a day - this was especially attractive due to the continuing austerity measures in post-war United Kingdom. Within ten years, his company had started mass tourism to Palma (1952), Lourdes (1953), Costa Brava (1954), Sardinia (1954), Minorca (1955), Porto (1956), Costa Blanca (1957) and Costa del Sol (1959).

However it was with cheap air travel in combination with the package tour that international mass tourism developed. The postwar introduction of an international system of airline regulation was another important factor. The bilateral agreements at the heart of the system fixed seat prices, and airlines could not fill blocks of empty seats on underused flights by discounting. But if they were purchased by a tour operator and hidden within the price of an inclusive holiday package, it would be difficult to prove that discounting had taken place - even though it was obvious that it had! This was the origin of the modern mass package tour.

These developments coincided with a significant increase in the standard of living in Britain. At the end of the 1950s, Harold Macmillan could say &quot;you've never had it so good.&quot;

Another significant development also happened at the end of this decade. The devaluation of the Spanish peseta made Spain appear a particularly attractive destination. The cheapness of the cost of living attracted increasing numbers of visitors. Mass package tourism has at times been an exploitative process, in which tour operators in a country with a high standard of living make use of development opportunities and low operating costs in a country with a lower standard of living. However, as witness the development of many tourist areas in previously poor parts of the world, and the concomitant rise in standards of living, when there is equality of bargaining power, both parties can gain economic benefits from this arrangement.

Spain and the Balearic Islands became major tourist destinations, and development probably peaked in the 1980s. At the same time, British tour operators developed the Algarve in Portugal. The continuing search for new, cheaper, destinations spread mass tourism to the Greek Islands, Italy, Tunisia, Morocco, parts of the coast of Turkey, and more recently Croatia.

For the worker living in greater London, Venice today is almost as accessible as Brighton was 100 years ago. Consequently, the British seaside resort experienced a marked decline from the 1970s onwards. Some, such as New Brighton have disappeared. Others have reinvented themselves, and now cater to daytrippers and the weekend break market.

=== Recent developments ===
There has been a discernible upmarket trend in tourism over the last few decades, especially in Europe where international travel for short breaks is commonplace. Tourists have higher levels of disposable income and greater leisure time. They are also better educated and have more sophisticated tastes. There is now a demand for a better quality product in many quarters. This has resulted in the following trends:-

* The old 'sun, sea, and sand' mass market has fragmented. People want more specialised versions of it, such as 'Club 18 -30', quieter resorts with select hotels, self-catering, etc.
* People are taking second holidays in the form of short breaks/city breaks, ranging from British and European cities to country hotels.
* There has been a growth in niche markets catering for special interests or activities, including growth of destination hotels.

The developments in technology and transport infrastructure (particularly the advent of jumbo jets) have placed some types of holiday in the affordable mainstream:-

* The development of a mass cruise holiday market.
* The advent of affordable holidays to long-haul destinations such as Thailand or Kenya.
* The phenomenon of the low budget airline, utilising a new generation of small regional airports.

There have also been changes in lifestyle, which may call into question the current definitions of tourism. Some people (particularly the 45+ and retired) may be adopting a tourism lifestyle, living as a tourist all the year round - eating out several times a week, going to the theatre, daytripping, and indulging in short breaks several times a year.

Much of this results in impulse purchasing. This is facilitated by internet purchasing of tourism products. Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging, in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor- made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations such as Bali and European cities. Some of the tourist destinations, including the Costa del Sol, the Baleares and Cancún have lost popularity due to shifting tastes. In this context, the excessive building and environmental destruction often associated with traditional &quot;sun and beach&quot; tourism may contribute to a destination's saturation and subsequent decline. This appears to be the case with Spain's Costa Brava, a byword for this kind of tourism in the 1960s and 1970s. With only 11% of the Costa Brava now unblemished by low-quality development (Greenpeace Spain's figure), the destination now faces a crisis in its tourist industry.

Sustainable tourism is becoming more popular as people start to realize the devastating effects tourism can have on communities.

Receptive tourism is now growing at a very rapid rate in many developing countries, where it is often the most important economic activity in local GDP.

In recent years, second holidays or vacations have become more popular as people's discretionary income increases. Typical combinations are a package to the typical mass tourist resort, with a winter skiing holiday or weekend break to a city or national park.

On December 26, 2004 a tsunami, caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake hit Asian countries bordering the Indian Ocean, and also the Maldives. Tens of thousands of lives were lost, and many tourists died. This, together with the vast clean-up operation in place, has stopped or severely hampered tourism to the area.

=== Special forms of tourism ===
For the past few decades other forms of tourism, also known as niche tourism, have been becoming more popular, particularly:

* Adventure tourism: tourism involving travel in rugged regions, or adventurous sports such as mountaineering and hiking (tramping).
* Agritourism: farm based tourism, helping to support the local agricultural economy.
* Ancestry tourism: (also known as genealogy tourism) is the travel with the aim of tracing one's ancestry, visiting the birth places of these ancestors and sometimes getting to know distant family.
* Armchair tourism and virtual tourism: not travelling physically, but exploring the world through internet, books, TV, etc.
* Audio tourism: includes audio walking tours and other audio guided forms of tourism including museum audio guides and audio travel books.
* Bookstore Tourism is a grassroots effort to support independent bookstores by promoting them as a travel destination.
* Creative Tourism is a new form of tourism that allows visitors to develop their creative potential, and get closer to local people, through informal participation in hands-on workshops that draw on the culture of their holiday destinations.
* Cultural tourism: includes urban tourism, visiting historical or interesting cities, and experiencing their cultural heritages. This type of tourism may also include specialized cultural experiences, such as art museum tourism where the tourist visits many art museums during the tour, or opera tourism where the tourist sees many operas or concerts during the tour.
* Dark tourism: is the travel to sites associated with death and suffering. The first tourist agency to specialise in this kind of tourism started with trips to Lakehurst, New Jersey, the scene of the Hindenburg airship disaster.
* Disaster tourism: travelling to a disaster scene not primarily for helping, but because it is interesting to see. It can be a problem if it hinders rescue, relief and repair work.
* Drug tourism: travel to a country to obtain or consume drugs, either legally or illegally.
* Ecotourism: ecological tourism.
* Educational tourism: may involve travelling to an education institution, a wooded retreat or some other destination in order to take personal-interest classes, such as cooking classes with a famous chef or crafts classes.
* Extreme tourism: tourism associated with high risk.
* Free Independent Traveler: a sector of the market and philosophy of constructing a vacation by sourcing one's own components e.g. accommodation, transport.
* Gambling tourism, e.g. to Atlantic City, Las Vegas, Palm Springs, California, Macau or Monte Carlo for the purpose of gambling at the casinos there.
* Garden tourism visiting botanical gardens famous places in the history of gardening, such as Versailles and the Taj Mahal.
* Heritage tourism: visiting historical (Rome, Athens, Cracow) or industrial sites, such as old canals, railways, battlegrounds, etc.
* Health tourism: usually to escape from cities or relieve stress, perhaps for some 'fun in the sun', etc. Often to Sanatoriums or &quot;health spas&quot;.
* Hobby tourism: tourism alone or with groups to participate in hobby interests, to meet others with similar interests, or to experience something pertinent to the hobby. Examples might be garden tours, amateur radio DX-peditions, or square dance cruises.
* Inclusive tourism: tourism marketed to those with functional limits or disabilities. Referred to as &quot;Tourism for All&quot; in some regions. Destinations often employ Universal Design and Universal Destination Development principles.
* Medical tourism, e.g.:
**for what is illegal in one's own country, such as abortion or euthanasia
**for advanced care that is not available in one's own country
**in the case that there are long waiting lists in one's own country
** Pop-culture tourism: tourism by those that visit a particular location after reading about it or seeing it in a film.
* Perpetual tourism: wealthy individuals always on vacation; some of them, for tax purposes, to avoid being resident in any country.
* Pilgrimage Tourism: pilgrimages to ancient holy places (Rome and Santiago de Compostela for Catholics, temples and stupas of Nepal for the Hindus and Buddhist, Mount Athos or Painted churches of northern Moldavia for the Orthodox), religious sites such as mosques, shrines, etc.
* Sex tourism: travelling solely for the purpose of sexual activity, usually with prostitutes
* Solo Travel: travelling alone
* Sport travel: skiing, golf and scuba diving are popular ways to spend a vacation. This could also include travelling to a major international sporting event such as the FIFA World Cup or following a tour such as the Ashes or British and Irish Lions.
* Space tourism: traveling in outer space or on spaceships.
* Vacilando is a special kind of wanderer for whom the process of travelling is more important than the destination.
* Wine tourism, the visiting of growing regions, vineyards, wineries, tasting rooms, wine festivals, and similar places or events for the purpose of consuming or purchasing wine.

=== Trends ===
The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4 %.[3] By 2020 Europe will remain the most popular destination, but its share will drop from 60 % in 1995 to 46 %. Long-haul will grow slightly faster than intraregional travel and by 2020 its share will increase from 18 % in 1995 to 24 %.

With the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet. Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.) can sell their services directly. This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.

Space tourism is expected to &quot;take off&quot; in the first quarter of the 21st century, although compared with traditional destinations the number of tourists in orbit will remain low until technologies such as a space elevator make space travel cheap.

Technological improvement is likely to make possible air-ship hotels, based either on solar-powered airplanes or large dirigibles. Underwater hotels, such as Hydropolis, expected to open in Dubai in 2006, will be built. On the ocean tourists will be welcomed by ever larger cruise ships and perhaps floating cities.

Some futurists expect that movable hotel &quot;pods&quot; will be created that could be temporarily erected anywhere on the planet, where building a permanent resort would be unacceptable politically, economically or environmentally.

== Sustainable tourism ==
There are many different definitions of sustainable tourism that have been developed over the last decade. Most tend to assume that all tourists are responsible for respecting and conserving a location's economic, environmental, and socio-cultural balances.

Global economists forecast continuing international tourism growth, ranging between three and six percent annually, depending on the location. As one of the world's largest and fastest growing industries, this continuous growth will place great stress on remaining biodiverse habitats, often used to support mass tourism. Sustainable tourists are aware of these dangers and seek to protect their favorite destinations, and to protect tourism as an industry. Sustainable tourists face many responsibilities to reduce tourism's impact on communities, including:

* informing themselves of the culture, politics, and economy of the communities being visited.
* anticipating and respecting local cultures' expectations and assumptions.
* contributing to intercultural understanding and tolerance.
* supporting the integrity of local cultures by favoring businesses which conserve cultural heritage
* supporting local economies by purchasing local goods and participating with small, local businesses.
* conserving resources by seeking out businesses that are environmentally conscious, and by using the least possible amount of non-renewable resources.

===Green conventions, meetings and events===
Large conventions, meetings and other major organized events drive the travel, tourism and hospitality industry. Cities and convention centers compete to attract such commerce, commerce which has heavy impacts on resource use and the environment. Major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games, present special problems regarding environmental burdens and degradation. But burdens imposed by the regular convention industry can be vastly more significant.

Green conventions and events are a new but growing sector and marketing point within the convention and hospitality industry. More environmentally aware organizations, corporations and government agencies are now seeking more sustainable event practices, greener hotels, restaurants and convention venues, and more energy efficient or climate neutral travel and ground transportation.

Additionally, some convention centers have begun to take direct action in reducing the impact of the conventions they host. One example is the Moscone Center in San Francisco, California, which has a very aggressive recycling program, a large solar power system, and other programs aimed at reducing impact and increasing efficiency.

With the advent of the internet, some traditional conventions are being replaced with virtual conventions, where the attendees remain in their home physical location and &quot;attend&quot; the convention by use of a web-based interface programmed for the task. This sort of &quot;virtual&quot; meeting eliminates all of the impacts associated with travel, accommodation, food wastage, and other necessary impacts of traditional, physical conventions.

===Sustainable travel===
Travel over long distances requires a large amount of either time or energy. Generally this involves burning fossil fuels, a largely unsustainable practice and one that contributes to climate change, via CO2 emissions.

Air travel is perhaps the worst offender in this regard, contributing to between 2 and 3% of global carbon emissions [1]. Given a business-as-usual approach, this could be expected to rise to 5% by 2015 and 10% by 2050. Car travel is the next worst offender.

Mass transport is the most climate friendly method of travel, and generally the rule is &quot;the bigger the better&quot; - compared to cars, buses are relatively more sustainable, and trains and ships are even more so. Human energy and renewable energy are the most efficient, and hence, sustainable. Travel by bicycle, solar powered car, or sailing boat produces no carbon emissions (although the embodied energy in these vehicles generally comes at the expense of carbon emission).

== Ecotourism ==
Ecotourism, or ecological tourism, is a movement to make Tourism more ecological. When successful, it contributes actively to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage, includes local and indigenous communities in its planning, development and operation, reduces poverty and ehnances intercultural &amp; environmental understanding.

== Travel planning ==

If you were to plan tourism you can use various online sources that allow for efficient and relatively low cost bookings of both flights and accommodations.

If you were going to start a business as a travel agent you could read books that cover this (although this one eventually should) or else you could study the topic at a local university or at Wikiversity (which should eventually cover the topic). 

== Tourism management ==
Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM) is a major in a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration.

Graduate students graduate with a Masters of Business Administration, a Masters or Science, or a Doctorate of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism Management.

It is a focus that is studied by individuals that are intending to work in the Hospitality Industry, examples of which are; Hotels, Resorts, Casinos, and Restaurants.

Within the HTM concentration there is generally:

* Food Management and Operations (Examples: Food Science, Food Selection and Preparation, Food and Beverage Operations)
* Lodging Operations (Examples: Hotel Operations, Lodging Management, Financial Management and Cost Control for Hospitality Organizations)
* Global Tourism (Examples: Travel and Tourism Management, Tourism Analysis, Hospitality and Research Methods)
* Event Management (Examples: Hospitality Sales, Catering Management, Hospitality Marketing Management)

Several large corporations such as Marriot, Hyatt (go to www.Hyatt.com for current openings), Wyndham and Hilton Hotels have summer internships/manager in training programs for students majoring in Hospitality and Tourism Management, to help students get valuable work experience...

== intrabound tourism ==

This passage is not clear: &quot;Intrabound tourism differs from ‘domestic tourism’ in that the former is more concerned with making and implementation of national tourism policies in consideration of the tourism ecosystem consisting of inbound, outbound and intrabound tourism.&quot; What is being contrasted?  In clear and simple English, what is intrabound tourism?  [[User:Kdammers|Kdammers]] ([[User talk:Kdammers|talk]]) 04:24, 17 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Probability==

===Basic Concepts===
Probability is a numerical measure of likelihood. If an event has a probability equal to&amp;nbsp;1 (or 100%), then it is certain to occur. If it has a probability equal to&amp;nbsp;0, then it will definitely not occur. And if it has a probability equal to 1/2 (or 50%), then it is as likely as not to occur.

You will know that tossing a fair coin has probability 1/2 to yield heads, and that casting a fair die has probability 1/6 to yield a&amp;nbsp;1. How do we know this?

There is a principle known as the ''principle of indifference'', which states: if there are n mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive possibilities, and if, as far as we know, there are no differences between the n&amp;nbsp;possibilities apart from their names (such as &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;), then each possibility should be assigned a probability equal to&amp;nbsp;1/n. (''Mutually exclusive'': only one possibility can be realized in a single trial. ''Jointly exhaustive'': at least one possibility is realized in a single trial. ''Mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive'': exactly ony possibility is realized in a single trial.)

Since this principle appeals to what we ''know'', it concerns ''epistemic'' probabilities (a.k.a. ''subjective'' probabilities) or ''degrees of belief''. If you are certain of the truth of a proposition, then you assign to it a probability equal to&amp;nbsp;1. If you are certain that a proposition is false, then you assign to it a probability equal to&amp;nbsp;0. And if you have no information that makes you believe that the truth of a proposition is more likely (or less likely) than its falsity, then you assign to it probability&amp;nbsp;1/2. Subjective probabilities are therefore also known as ''ignorance probabilities'': if you are ignorant of any differences between the possibilities, you assign to them equal probabilities.

If we assign probability&amp;nbsp;1 to a proposition because we ''believe'' that it is true, we assign a subjective probability, and if we assign probability&amp;nbsp;1 to an event because it ''is'' certain that it will occur, we assign an objective probability. Until the advent of quantum mechanics, the only objective probabilities known were ''relative frequencies''.

The advantage of the frequentist definition of probability is that it allows us to measure probabilities, at least approximately. The trouble with it is that it refers to ''ensembles''. You can't measure the probability of heads by tossing a single coin. You get better and better approximations to the probability of heads by tossing a larger and larger number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of coins and dividing the number &lt;math&gt;N_H&lt;/math&gt; of heads by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;N.&lt;/math&gt; The exact probability of heads is the limit

:&lt;math&gt;
p(H)=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\frac{N_H}N.&lt;/math&gt;

The meaning of this formula is that for any positive number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon,&lt;/math&gt; however small, you can find a (sufficiently large but finite) number&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;
\left|p(H) - \frac{N_H}N\right| &lt; \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

The probability that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; events from a mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;possible events happen is the sum of the probabilities of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;events. Suppose, for example, you win if you cast either a 1 or a 6. The probability of winning is

:&lt;math&gt;
p(1\hbox{ or }6) = p(1)+p(6) = \frac16+\frac16=\frac13.&lt;/math&gt;

In frequentist terms, this is virtually self-evident. &lt;math&gt;N(1)/N&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;p(1),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;N(6)/N&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;p(6),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[N(1)+N(6)]/N&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;p(1\hbox{ or }6).&lt;/math&gt;

The probability that two ''independent'' events happen is the product of the probabilities of the individual events. Suppose, for example, you cast two dice and you win if the total is 12. Then

:&lt;math&gt;
p(6\hbox{ and }6)=p(6)\times p(6)= \frac16\times\frac16=\frac1{36}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the principle of indifference, there are now &lt;math&gt;6\times6=36&lt;/math&gt; equiprobable possibilities, and casting a total of 12 with two dice is one of them.

It is important to remember that the ''joint probability'' &lt;math&gt;p(A,B) = p(A\hbox{ and }B)&lt;/math&gt; of two events &lt;math&gt;A,B&lt;/math&gt; equals the product of the individual probabilities &lt;math&gt;p(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(B)&lt;/math&gt; ''only if'' the two events are independent, meaning that the probability of one does not depend on whether or not the other happens. In terms of propositions: the probability that the conjunction &lt;math&gt;P_1\hbox{ and }P_2&lt;/math&gt; is true is the probability that &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; is true times the probability that &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; is true ''only if'' the probability that either proposition is true does not depend on whether the other is true or false. Ignoring this can have the [[wikipedia:Sally Clark|most tragic consequences]].

The general rule for the joint probability of two events is

:&lt;math&gt;
p(A,B) = p(B|A)\,p(A) = p(A|B)\,p(B).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p(B|A)&lt;/math&gt; is a ''conditional probability'': the probability of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ''given that''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;A.&lt;/math&gt;

To see this, let &lt;math&gt;N(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; be the number of trials in which both &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; happen or are true. &lt;math&gt;N(A,B)/N&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;p(A,B),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;N(A,B)/N(A)&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;p(B|A),&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N(A)/N&lt;/math&gt; approximates &lt;math&gt;p(A).&lt;/math&gt; But

:&lt;math&gt;
p(A,B)\;\stackrel{N\rightarrow\infty}{\longleftarrow}\;\frac{N(A,B)}N = \frac{N(A,B)}{N(A)}\times \frac{N(A)}N\;\stackrel{N\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow}\;p(B|A)\,p(A). &lt;/math&gt;
An immediate consequence of this is ''Bayes' theorem'':
:&lt;math&gt;

p(B|A) = \frac{p(A|B)}{p(A)}p(B).&lt;/math&gt;

The following is just as readily established:

:&lt;math&gt;
p(X) = p(X|Y)\,p(Y)+p(X|\overline{Y})\,p(\overline{Y}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{Y}&lt;/math&gt; happens or is true whenever &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; does not happen or is false. The generalization to &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive possibilities should be obvious.

&lt;br&gt;
----
&lt;br&gt;
Given a ''random variable'', which is a set &lt;math&gt;X=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; of random numbers, we may want to know the arithmetic mean

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle X\rangle = \frac1n \sum_{k=1}^n x_k = \frac{x_1+\cdots+x_n}n&lt;/math&gt;

as well as the ''standard deviation'', which is the root-mean-square deviation from the arithmetic mean,

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma(X) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n (x_k - \langle X\rangle)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The standard deviation is an important measure of ''statistical dispersion''.

Given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; possible measurement outcomes &lt;math&gt;v_1,\dots v_n&lt;/math&gt; with probabilities &lt;math&gt;p_k=p(v_k),&lt;/math&gt; we have a ''probability distribution'' &lt;math&gt;\{p_1,\dots,p_n\},&lt;/math&gt; and we may want to know the ''expected value'' of&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X,&lt;/math&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle X\rangle = \sum_{k=1}^n p_k x_k&lt;/math&gt;

as well as the corresponding standard deviation

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma(X)=\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^n p_k (x_k-\langle X\rangle)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

which is a handy measure of the fuzziness of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

We have defined probability as a numerical measure of likelihood. So what is likelihood? What is probability apart from being a numerical measure? The frequentist definition covers some cases, the epistemic definition covers others, but which definition would cover all cases? It seems that probability is one of those concepts that are intuitively meaningful to us, but — just like time or the experience of purple — cannot be explained in terms of other concepts.

[[This quantum world/Appendix/Probability|'''&amp;lt; PREVIOUS''']]
&lt;/div&gt;

===Some Problems===

'''Problem 1 (Monty Hall)'''. A player in a game show is given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is the Grand Prize (say, a car); behind the other two doors are booby prizes (say, goats). The player picks a door, and the show host peeks behind the doors and opens one of the remaining doors. There is a booby prize behind the door he opened. The host then offers the player either to stay with the door that was chosen at the beginning, or to switch to the other closed door. What gives the player the better chance of winning: to switch doors or to stay with the original choice? Or are the chances equal?


'''Problem 2'''. Imagine you toss a coin successively and wait till the first time the pattern HTT appears. For example, if the sequence of tosses was

:H H T H H T H H T T H H T T T H T H

then the pattern HTT would appear after the 10th toss. Let A(HTT) be the average number of tosses until HTT occurs, and let A(HTH) be the average number of tosses until HTH occurs. Which of the following is true?

:(a) A( HTH) &lt; ( HTT), (b) A(HTH) = A(HTT), or (c) A(HTH) &gt; A(HTT).


'''Problem 3'''. Imagine a test for a certain disease (say, HIV) that is 99% accurate. And suppose a person picked at random tests positive. What is the probability that the person actually has the disease?

====Solutions====
'''Problem 1'''. Let &lt;math&gt;p(C1)&lt;/math&gt; be the probability that the car is behind door&amp;nbsp;1, &lt;math&gt;p(O3)&lt;/math&gt; the probability that the host opens door&amp;nbsp;3, and &lt;math&gt;p(O3|C1)&lt;/math&gt; the probability that the host opens door&amp;nbsp;3 given that the car is behind door&amp;nbsp;1. We have

:&lt;math&gt;
p(O3) = p(O3|C1)\,p(C1)+p(O3|C2)\,p(C2) +p(O3|C3)\,p(C3)&lt;/math&gt;

as well as

:&lt;math&gt;
p(O3|C2)\,p(C2) = p(C2|O3)\,p(O3).&lt;/math&gt;

If the first choice is door&amp;nbsp;1, then &lt;math&gt;p(O3|C1)=1/2,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;p(O3|C2)=1,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p(O3|C3)=0.&lt;/math&gt; Hence 

:&lt;math&gt;
p(O3) = \frac12\times\frac13+1\times\frac13 + 0\times\frac13 = \frac12&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;
p(C2|O3) = \frac{p(O3|C2)\,p(C2)}{p(O3)} = \frac{1\times\frac13}{\frac12} = \frac23.&lt;/math&gt;

In words: If the player's first choice is door&amp;nbsp;1 and the host opens door&amp;nbsp;3, then the probability that the car is behind door&amp;nbsp;2 is &lt;math&gt;2/3,&lt;/math&gt; whereas the probability that it is behind door&amp;nbsp;1 is 1 – 2/3 = 1/3. A quicker way to see that switching ''doubles'' the chances of winning is to compare this game with another one, in which the show host offers the choice of either opening the originally chosen door or opening ''both'' other doors (and winning regardless of which, if any, has the car). 

Note: This result depends on the show host *deliberately* opening only a door with a goat behind it. If she doesn't know - or doesn't care (!) - which door the car is behind, and opens a remaining door at random, then 1/3 of the outcomes that were initially possible have been removed by her having opened a door with a goat. In this case the player gains no advantage (or disadvantage) by switching. So the answer depends on the rules of the game, not just the sequence of events. Of course the player may not know what the 'rules' are in this respect, in which case he should still switch doors because there can be no disadvantage in doing so.

'''Problem 2'''. The average number of tosses until HTT occurs, A(HTT), equals&amp;nbsp;8, whereas A(HTH) = 10. To see why the latter is greater, imagine you have tossed HT. If you are looking for HTH and the next toss gives you HTT, then your next chance to see HTH is after a total of 6 tosses, whereas if you are looking for HTT and the next toss gives you HTH, then your next chance to see HTT is after a total of 5 tosses.

'''Problem 3'''. The answer depends on how rare the disease is. Suppose that one in 10,000 has it. This means 100 in a million. If a million are tested, there will be 99 true positives and one false negative. 99% of the remaining 999,900 — that is, 989,901 — will yield true negatives and 1% — that is, 9,999 — will yield false positives. The probability that a randomly picked person testing positive actually has the disease is the number of true positives divided by the number of positives, which in this particular example is 99/(9999+99) = 0.0098 — less than&amp;nbsp;1%!

===Moral===
Be it scientific data or evidence in court — there are usually competing explanations, and usually each explanation has a likely bit and an unlikely bit. For example, having the disease is unlikely, but the test is likely to be correct; not having the disease is likely, but a false test result is unlikely. You can see the importance of accurate assessments of the likelihood of competing explanations, and if you have tried the problems, you have seen that we aren't very good at such assessments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Just a small note on the example shown on this page. The solution presented by the Karnaugh map is not optimized in that a hazard appears when the circuit moves from (ABCD) 1100 to 1000. To improve the coverage, hazards should be mentioned and, in this case, remedied by adding another combination for the state AC'B'.

Removing My Karnaugh Map:

I'll be removing the karnaugh map that I made in paint since the one that was posted by Cburnett is far more superior. [[User:Asm2750|Asm2750]] 16:03, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

== My first edit ==

I've just added a subsection about the creation of K-maps, describing how should the input combinations ordered, which is a criticall point about the map.
This is my first edit in a wiki site, so if you see anything that should be corrected (specially about formating, structure and so on, the content itself, despite needed, is pretty simple and not likely to have errors) go on and fix it; and I'd really appreciate it if you mention the corrections and their reasons so I can avoid repeating mistakes in future edits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Talk page from Merged Book [[Game Theory|Game Theory]] ==

Anyone have an outline for how this book should be organized? --[[User:Chuckhoffmann|Chuck Hoffmann]] 13:37, 15 Apr 2005 (UTC)

=== Game Theory Handbook outline ===

Rough ideas on what should be here:

#Introduction
#What is a game? Definitions and classifications
#Non-cooperative games
#Bargaining theory
#Cooperative games
#Games in continuous state-spaces and differential games
#Auctions
#Mechanism design
#Appendix: theorems and proofs

Hey Chuck and whoever suggested the outline, I've been waiting here for a while for someone to get working on this book but it doesn't seem to be happening. If I get any spare time I'll try and add some stuff, but I think its probably pointless discussing stuff on the talk page now because no-one seems to be interested in this book anymore due to a lack of interest in writing it.

=== Stuff moved from duplicate book [[Game theory]] ===

We will first look at the game theory by von Neumann and Morgenstein and then later study multiplayer games, nonzero sum games, games with chance, and finally, combinatorial game theory. - [[User:128.175.112.225|128.175.112.225]]

----

Is it on topic to include items on Combinatorial Game Theory, studying games such as Nim and such like? - [[User:Paul|Paul]]

----

The book should probably have some extensive information on evolutionary game theory.  Much has been written by Maynard Smith and others.  It seems EGT will be a big part of the future of GT. - [[User:67.162.52.102|67.162.52.102]]

=== Edit war ===

We seem to have an edit war going on. I was going to use '/' rather than ':' as per [[WB:NP]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:50, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

Dear god, I'm so sorry mate, having never been in something even near an edit war before (i seem to work on projects no-one else touches) I was a bit confused. Sorry. I think everything's sorted out now as per [[WB:NP]]...at least I hope so. Once again, sorry Aya...[[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:55, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

:Nah. My fault. I'm on the RC IRC server at irc://irc.wikimedia.org/#en.wikibooks so I can see every edit pop up as it happens. I shouldn't assume you see the same thing. :-) - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:07, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

=== Ideas ===

There's loads of content from Wikipedia we could use here. Much of the stuff on [[w:Prisoner's dilemma]] seems too in-depth, so we could shift it to here. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:54, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, OK, Ii'll see what I can do. Thanks again. - [[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:55, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

Actually, just had a look at [[w:Prisoner's dilemma]] and apparently it's a feature article over in Wikipedia, so the guys over there think its an excellent article and probably like the &quot;in-depth&quot; nature of it, even though I have to agree with Aya, it probably should be on Wikibooks. I might use it as a basis and expand from it. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 00:59, August 12, 2005 (UTC)

: Don't be afraid to fork the content. This is now allowed as per [[Wikibooks:About]]. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:08, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

===Nuclear war as an example?===
As I noticed in the article on MAD, Nuclear war could be used as an example of a Nash Equilibrium in game theory. If you think it's a good idea, let me know and I'll try and work it in. [[User:Lithran|Lithran]] 13:15, 15 May 2007 (UTC)
:Sounds good to me.  I've added it to the contents page.  Should be an interesting addition to the book.  --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 15:20, 15 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are a newcomer to XForms and you are having problems debugging XForms you are not alone.  XForms debugging can be tricky especially for newcomers.  If you follow the newsgroups on XForms you will see several problems come up frequently.

== Common Problems ==
These problems, roughly sorted in terms of frequency include the following:

# Make sure to name your files with the &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;.xhtml&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; extension.  Many browsers including FireFox do not look for XML tags in files with the .htm or .html extension.
# Problems related to forgetting to associate instance data with a namespace or the default namespace.  This can be fixed by adding the &lt;code&gt;xmlns=&quot;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to your instance variable
# Incorrect or missing namespaces in the body of a document.  For example if the default namespace is html the tag &lt;input&gt; is valid but the browser will look at it as &lt;html:input&gt; not &lt;xf:input&gt;.  This happens frequently when users copy XForms example code from places that use XForms as the default namespace.  This is a good reason that tutorial and training developers should not use XForms as the default namespace.
# Incorrect binding between the model and the view.  This usually occurs because the &quot;ref&quot; or &quot;nodeset&quot; attributes are not correctly defined or that the group or repeat changes the path prefix of a data element.
# Failure to bind to the form to the instance because the XForms processor cannot find one or more instance specific namespaces.  If you have customised your XForm with an XSLT or an XQuery before streaming it to your user, the processor might relegated the declaration of some of your namespaces to the instance where they first occur because it treats the contents of the ref and bind attributes on your xform as just content.  However, your XForms processor probably expects the definition of the namespaces in your ref attributes to be on the parent axis and may not look in the model instances for any declarations.  When this happens you will need to manually construct the root xhtml:html node, explicitly declaring any namespaces that appear in your form.

== Using an XForms Validator ==
Some people have found this XForms validator helpful:

[http://xformsinstitute.com/validator http://xformsinstitute.com/validator]

This program will find common errors in XForms examples.

== Using Eclipse to validate XPath ==
There is a nice eclipse plugin for XSLT providing also an XPath validation &quot;view&quot;.
See: http://wiki.eclipse.org/XSLT_Project

== Debugging Tools for Firefox ==
One of the most useful Firefox extensions is the XForms Buddy debugger.  This tool allows you to visually inspect all of the instances in the model while the XForms are running in the Firefox browser.  This is especially useful for ensuring that instance values that are dynamically configured are correctly set by the XForms.  The link to the site is: [http://beaufour.dk/index.php?sec=misc&amp;pagename=xforms here]

== Printing your Bindings Using JavaScript ==
There is also a way to visually view your binding from within your JavaScript code.

These interfaces are documented here:

[http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/extensions/xforms/nsIXFormsAccessors.idl#48 nsIXFormsAccessors]

== Mozilla Debugging Tips ==

Here are some suggestions for people that are debugging XForms:

[http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XForms:Form_Troubleshooting Mozilla XForms Troubleshooting page]

== Testing Submissions ==

Sometimes when you are creating complex submissions to web services you need to make sure that what the XForms application is generating is exactly what the web service is expecting.  Sometimes a web service vendor will provide a sample web forms client that correctly calls their service but the documentation on calling that service is somewhat lacking.  One solution to this problem it to watch the HTTP packets leave the working application and compare them with the HTTP packets with your XForms.  This can be done using an HTTP proxy tools such as [http://www.xk72.com/charles/ Charles] which also runs as a Firefox extension.

The &quot;network&quot; tab of standard web development debuggers, like [http://getfirebug.com/ Firebug] and Google Chrome Javascript Console can be used to watch incoming and outgoing network traffic to and from the browser, allowing you to verify that the content of submissions, their methods, and HTTP error codes are what would be expected.

== Using an HTTP Proxy With Firefox ==

A Proxy is a tools that &quot;stands in&quot; for a web server.  It puts itself in between your web browser and the server and tells you what the browser just sent to the web server.  To do this you have to set your web browser to use the proxy (by telling it to forward everything to another IP address) and the proxy then forwards it to the service.

When you are finished using the proxy, make sure you remember to disable the proxy by going to the Firefox Tools/Options/General/Connection Settings and click the Direction Connection to the Internet.  If you do not your web browser will no longer function when Charles or Tamper Data shuts down.

== Debugging WebDAV and Subversion ==
There are some XForms that are designed to use HTTP put, HTTP post and [w:WebDAV:WebDAV].  The WebDAV allows you to store not just the first verson of a form but go back and see prior versions.  Subversion FAQ [http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/www/faq.html|FAQ] suggests you run the [http://www.wireshark.org Wireshark] packet sniffer and look at the data in the HTTP messages.

==Verifiying that a file is well-formed==
To verify that a data file is well formed, you can use the [http://www.xml.com/pub/a/tools/ruwf/check.html RUWF (Are you well-formed)? The XML Syntax Checker]

== Setting Mime-type in Internet Explorer Version 6.0 ==
Some versions of IE 6.0 do not have the correct mime-type set for IE6.  TO fix this you must add an entry to the Microsoft Windows Registry:

Open the Command Shell
Enter the command &quot;regedit&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/xhtml+xml]
&quot;CLSID&quot;=&quot;{25336920-03F9-11cf-8FD0-00AA00686F13}&quot;
&quot;Encoding&quot;=hex:08,00,00,00
&quot;Extension&quot;=&quot;.xhtml&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In wilderness areas searches are conducted in an ever widening circle normally.  All available resources are used including hunting dogs, aircraft, search hikers, and mounted search personnel.  When a person is lost in the wilderness there is rarely any expense spared in the search for the person.  If details are known about intended camping sites and hiking routes then teams will be sent to investigate those locations directly while others are sent into line of site search patterns where from the best known location for the missing person(s) was outward with each searcher being within site of the next.  This will also be done in staggered waves so that any evidence overlooked by one searcher might be found by the next.  When the area becomes large enough to make line of site searches impractical the teams will be broken into zones using a search grid.  A team of two or more will be assigned some small piece of the map area to search, all areas will be searched repeatedly for missed evidence or people.  All the while roadways and known paths will have searches, or outposts on them in case the victim is still mobile and trying to work his way out of his circumstance.  Aircraft will search in grids as well when weather provides.  At night some aircraft may utilize heat sensors to try and identify people in the wilderness, this has proven effective at times and at other times not.  When an aircraft identifies a possible victim a search team in the grid will respond to the location, sometimes they find nothing; other times they find animals.  If a person is seeking shelter in a very cold area, he may have burrowed deep enough into a location as to defeat the heat sensors on any aircraft as was the case with a child in Arizona who hid among some cactus which cool greatly at night.  This particular child had evaded rescuers intentionally for more than a day because he was not supposed to talk to strangers.

Individuals with this Paraphilia use sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors involving infliction of pain, suffering or humiliation to enhance or achieve sexual excitement.

'''Diagnostic criteria for 302.84 Sexual Sadism ''' 
  
''A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving acts (real, not simulated) in which the psychological or physical suffering (including humiliation) of the victim is sexually exciting to the person.'' 

''B. The person has acted on these urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.''

'''Etiology'''

There are no primary theories for the cause of this disorder.

'''Treatment'''

Treatment may require both the application of psychotherapeutic techniques and drug therapy

'''Prognosis'''

Prognosis is poor, and most results are sub-optimal. 

====='''Affects of Sadism'''=====
This type of sexual desire can lead to serious crimes. According to (Fedoroff 638-639), 39% of general population males have fantasies of &quot;tying up&quot; women, and 30% &quot;raping a women&quot;. This percentage being very close can eventually make it difficult to distinguish violent sexual crimes from consented sexual situations.&lt;ref&gt; Fedoroff, Paul. &quot;Sadism,Sadomasochism,Sex, and Violence.&quot; Canadian Journal of Psychiatrics 53.10 (2008): 638-639. Web. 1 May 2011. &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=2b16281c-fee5-4f70-9dfa-25c8bbaea988%40sessionmgr10&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=13&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

__NOTOC__
=Pinyin Pronunciation=
This lesson shows the pronunciation of pinyin, the standard Romanization system used for Mandarin Chinese and the one that will be used throughout the textbook. While most of the letters are the same or very close to the English usage, there are some important differences.

== Pronunciation Basics==
Mandarin Chinese may sound strange, but is actually relatively easy for English speakers to pick up—much easier than it is for Mandarin-speakers to learn English. A large part of the reason is that Chinese has a very limited sound inventory, meaning there are not many sounds in the language, and hardly any new ones if you already know English. On the other hand, that means Chinese-speakers trying to grasp English must learn to produce dozens of entirely new sounds&amp;mdash;remember that as you proceed through these first lessons on pronunciation!

One very different aspect of Chinese is its use of [[w:Pinyin#Tones|tones]]. Because of its limited sound inventory, the pitch, also known as the tone or inflection, is used to help differentiate between words. Words with different tones usually have entirely different meanings, but may have the same base with different radicals. While some dialects of Chinese have up to nine tones, Mandarin is comparatively easy with only four. It's often difficult for beginners to distinguish the tone of a word, especially when not sure of the context, people who do not speak a [[w:Tone_(linguistics)|tonal language]] are not used to listening for pitch in conversation. Speaking Chinese is like singing, but even if you have perfect pitch, it may be hard to follow or reproduce what seems like a roller coaster ride of tonal transitions. Don't worry though, you'll improve by listening and practicing. These lessons will describe how to understand and reproduce all the syllables and tones of Mandarin.

=== If you know another Romanization system or the IPA===
If you are familiar with Zhuyin (bopomofo), Tongyong Pinyin, or the Wade-Giles system of Romanization, Wikipedia has an [[w:Zhuyin#Zhuyin_vs._Tongyong_Pinyin_.26_Hanyu_Pinyin|equivalency chart]] comparing the different systems. Learn to use [[w:Hanyu Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]]&amp;mdash;the more common Romanization system for Chinese, which will be used for this book.

The [[w:International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], or International Phonetic Alphabet, is a standard set of symbols that can be used to write ''any'' sound from ''any'' human language. The sounds of pinyin are listed below in IPA.

== The Mandarin syllable ==
There are three parts to all syllables in Mandarin; the ''[[w:initial | initial]]'', the ''[[w:final | final]]'', and the ''tone''.  In pinyin, the tone, initial, and final are represented as follows:

=== Tone ===
The '''tone''' is represented by a tone mark placed on top of the syllable. There are exactly four tone marks: ˉ, ˊ, ˇ, and ˋ. The two dots on ü (like a German umlaut) do not have to do with the tone, so if you see ǖ, ǘ, ǚ, or ǜ, the symbol ''above'' the dots represents the tone.

=== Initial===
The '''initial''' is...
*in the beginning of a syllable
*a consonant (excluding ''y'', or ''w'')
*usually one letter, except for ''zh'', ''ch'', ''sh''

=== Final===
The '''final''' is made up of the letter(s) after a syllable&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s initial, not including the tone mark.  A final...
*begins with a vowel
*can be made of 1-4 characters
*ends with a vowel, ''n'', ''ng'', or ''r''

=== Exceptions to initial-final combinations in syllables===
Some syllables have no initial or no final. In Pinyin, this is shown as follows:
*'''For syllables with no final:'''
**an unpronounced ''i'' is added to the end of the syllable
**Occurs only with the following initials:''zh'', ''ch'', ''sh'', ''r'', ''z'', ''c'', ''s''
*'''For syllables with no initial:'''
**if the final begins with an ''i'', it is replaced with a ''y''
**if the final begins with an ''u'', it is replaced with a ''w''
**if the final begins with an ''ü'', it is replaced with ''yu''
**'''Exceptions to the above:'''
***''i'' alone is replaced by ''yi''
***''iu'' is replaced by ''you''
***''in'' is replaced by ''yin''
***''ing'' is replaced by ''ying''
***''u'' alone is replaced by ''wu''
***''ui'' is replaced by ''wei''
***''un'' is replaced by ''wen''
***''ueng'' is replaced by ''weng''

'''One other exception:'''
*when combined with initials ''j'', ''q'', ''x''; any ''ü'' in a final is changed to ''u''.

Please note that the pronunciation of these syllables is not according to the English pronunciation of the letters.  The next few pages give examples of how initials and finals are pronounced, put together, and how to use tones.

Keen to be involved in Devon-related stuff anywhere.  Generally, I'm waiting for a Wikiproject to start in en.Wikipedia.  Also would be keen to see Cornish-language material in wikibooks.  Will have to look round - too much to do!

Exponential distribution refers to a statistical distribution used to model the time between independent events that happen at a constant average rate λ. Some examples of this distribution are:

* The distance between one car passing by after the previous one.
* The rate at which radioactive particles decay.

For the stochastic variable X, probability distribution function of it is:

&lt;math&gt;
f_x (x) =
\begin{cases}
\lambda e^{- \lambda x}, &amp; \mbox{if } x \ge 0 \\
0, &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the cumulative distribution function is:

&lt;math&gt;
F_x (x) =
\begin{cases}
0, &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0 \\
{1 - e^{- \lambda x}}, &amp; \mbox{if } x \ge 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Exponential distribution is denoted as &lt;math&gt; X \in \mbox{Exp(m)} &lt;/math&gt;, where m is the average number of events within a given time period. So if m=3 per minute, i.e. there are three events per minute, then λ=1/3, i.e. one event is expected on average to take place every 20 seconds.

====Mean====
We derive the mean as follows.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \int^\infin_{-\infin} x \cdot f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \int^\infin_{0}x\lambda e^{- \lambda x} dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \int^\infin_{0}(-x)(-\lambda e^{- \lambda x}) dx&lt;/math&gt;
We will use [[integration by parts]] with ''u=−x'' and ''v=e&lt;sup&gt;−λx&lt;/sup&gt;''. We see that ''du=-1'' and ''dv=−λe&lt;sup&gt;−λx&lt;/sup&gt;''.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \left[-x \cdot e^{- \lambda x}\right]^\infin_{0} - \int^\infin_{0}(e^{- \lambda x})(-1) dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = [0-0] + \left[{-1 \over \lambda}(e^{ -\lambda x})\right]^\infin_{0} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \left[0-{-1 \over \lambda}\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = {1 \over \lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====
We use the following formula for the variance.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \operatorname{E}[X^2]-(\operatorname{E}[X])^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \int^\infin_{-\infin} x^2 \cdot f(x) dx-\left({1 \over \lambda} \right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \int^\infin_{0}x^2 \lambda e^{- \lambda x} dx-{1 \over \lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;
We'll use integration by parts with ''u=−x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''v=e&lt;sup&gt;−λx&lt;/sup&gt;''. From this we have ''du=−2x'' and ''dv=−λe&lt;sup&gt;−λx&lt;/sup&gt;''
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \left\{\left[-x^2 \cdot e^{- \lambda x}\right]^\infin_{0} - \int^\infin_{0}(e^{- \lambda x})(-2x) dx\right\}-{1 \over \lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = [0-0]+ {2 \over \lambda}\int^\infin_{0}x \lambda e^{- \lambda x} dx -{1 \over \lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;
We see that the integral is just E[''X''] which we solved for above.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {2 \over \lambda}{1 \over \lambda} -{1 \over \lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = {1 \over \lambda^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The Gamma distribution is very important for technical reasons, since it is the parent of the exponential distribution and can explain many other distributions.

The probability distribution function is:

&lt;math&gt;
f_x (x) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{a^p \Gamma (p)} x^{p-1} e^{-x/a}, &amp; \mbox{if } x \ge 0 \\
0, &amp; \mbox{if } x &lt; 0
\end{cases}\quad a,p &gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(p) = \int_0^\infty  t^{p-1} e^{-t}\,dt\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[w:Gamma function|Gamma function]]. The cumulative distribution function cannot be found unless p=1, in which case the Gamma distribution becomes the exponential distribution. The Gamma distribution of the stochastic variable X is denoted as &lt;math&gt; X \in \Gamma (p,a) &lt;/math&gt;.

Alternatively, the gamma distribution can be parameterized in terms of a shape parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha = k&lt;/math&gt; and an inverse scale parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta = 1/\theta&lt;/math&gt;, called a rate parameter:

:&lt;math&gt; g(x;\alpha,\beta) = K x^{\alpha-1}  e^{-\beta\,x}   \ \mathrm{for}\ x &gt; 0 \,\!.&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; constant can be calculated setting the integral of the density function as 1:

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}g(x;\alpha,\beta) \mathrm{d}t \, = \int_{0}^{+\infty} K x^{\alpha-1}  e^{-\beta\,x}  \mathrm{d}x \, = 1
&lt;/math&gt;

following:

:&lt;math&gt;
K \int_{0}^{+\infty} x^{\alpha-1}  e^{-\beta\,x}  \mathrm{d}x \, = 1
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
K = \frac{1}{\int_{0}^{+\infty} x^{\alpha-1}  e^{-\beta\,x}  \mathrm{d}x}
&lt;/math&gt;

and, with change of variable &lt;math&gt; y = \beta x &lt;/math&gt; :

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
K &amp;= \frac{1}{\int_{0}^{+\infty} \frac{y^{\alpha-1}}{\beta^{\alpha - 1}}  e^{-y}  \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\beta}} \\

&amp;= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\beta^{\alpha}}\int_{0}^{+\infty} y^{\alpha-1}  e^{-y} \mathrm{d}y} \\

&amp;= \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\int_{0}^{+\infty} y^{\alpha-1}  e^{-y}  \mathrm{d}y} \\

&amp;= \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

following:

:&lt;math&gt; g(x;\alpha,\beta) = x^{\alpha-1}  \frac{\beta^{\alpha} \, e^{-\beta\,x} }{\Gamma(\alpha)}  \ \mathrm{for}\ x &gt; 0 \,\!.&lt;/math&gt;

====Probability Density Function====
We first check that the total integral of the probability density function is 1.
:&lt;math&gt;\int^\infin_{-\infin}\frac{1}{a^p \Gamma (p)} x^{p-1} e^{-x/a}dx&lt;/math&gt;
Now we let ''y=x/a'' which means that ''dy=dx/a''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ \Gamma (p)} \int^\infin_{0} y^{p-1} e^{-y}dy&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{ \Gamma (p)} \Gamma (p)=1&lt;/math&gt;

====Mean====
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]=\int^\infin_{-\infin}x \cdot \frac{1}{a^p \Gamma (p)} x^{p-1} e^{-x/a}dx&lt;/math&gt;
Now we let ''y=x/a'' which means that ''dy=dx/a''.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]=\int^\infin_{0}ay \cdot \frac{1}{\Gamma (p)} y^{p-1} e^{-y}dy&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]=\frac{a}{\Gamma (p)}\int^\infin_{0}y^{p} e^{-y}dy&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]=\frac{a}{\Gamma (p)}\Gamma (p+1)&lt;/math&gt;
We now use the fact that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma (z+1)=z\Gamma (z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X]=\frac{a}{\Gamma (p)}p\Gamma (p)=ap&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====
We first calculate E[X^2]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2]=\int^\infin_{-\infin}x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{a^p \Gamma (p)} x^{p-1} e^{-x/a}dx&lt;/math&gt;
Now we let ''y=x/a'' which means that ''dy=dx/a''.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2]=\int^\infin_0 a^2 y^2 \cdot \frac{1}{a \Gamma (p)} y^{p-1} e^{-y}ady&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2]=\frac{a^2}{ \Gamma (p)}\int^\infin_0  y^{p+1} e^{-y}dy&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X^2]=\frac{a^2}{ \Gamma (p)}\Gamma (p+2) =pa^2(p+1)&lt;/math&gt;
Now we use calculate the variance
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X)=\operatorname{E}[X^2]-(\operatorname{E}[X])^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X)=pa^2(p+1)-(ap)^2=pa^2&lt;/math&gt;

Normal distribution is without exception the most widely used distribution. It also goes under the name Gaussian distribution. It assumes that the observations are closely clustered around the mean, μ, and this amount is decaying quickly as we go farther away from the mean. The measure of spread is quantified by the variance, &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

Some examples of applications are:

* If the average man is 175 cm tall with a variance of 6 cm, what is the probability that a man found at random will be 183 cm tall?
* If the average man is 175 cm tall with a variance of 6 cm and the average woman is 168 cm tall with a variance of 3cm, what is the probability that the average man will be shorter than the average woman?
* If cans are assumed to have a variance of 4 grams, what does the average weight need to be in order to ensure that the 99% of all cans have a weight of at least 250 grams?

The density function is:

:&lt;math&gt;
f_{\mu,\sigma} (x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; - \infty &lt; x &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;.

and the cumulative distribution function cannot be integrated into a single expression.

Normal distribution with parameters μ and σ is denoted as &lt;math&gt;N(\mu,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;. If the rv ''X'' is normally distributed with expectation μ and standard deviation σ, one denotes: &lt;math&gt;\!\,X \sim N(\mu,\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;

====Probability mass function====
To verify that ''f(x)'' is a valid pmf we must verify that (1) it is non-negative everywhere, and (2) that the total integral is equal to 1. The first is obvious, so we move on to verify the second.
:&lt;math&gt;\int^\infin_{-\infin} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} dx=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \int^\infin_{-\infin}  e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;
Now let &lt;math&gt;w={x-\mu \over \sigma \sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;. We see that &lt;math&gt;dw={dx \over \sigma \sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int^\infin_{-\infin}  e^{-w^2} dw&lt;/math&gt;
Now we use the [[w:Gaussian integral|Gaussian integral]] that &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-w^2}\,dw = \sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{ \pi}} \sqrt{\pi}=1&lt;/math&gt;

====Mean====
We derive the mean as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \int^\infin_{-\infin} x \cdot f(x) dx = \int^\infin_{-\infin}x \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \int^\infin_{-\infin}[(x-\mu)+\mu] \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \int^\infin_{-\infin}(x-\mu) \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} dx + \int^\infin_{-\infin}\mu \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}(-\sigma^2)\int^\infin_{-\infin}{-x+\mu \over \sigma^2}  e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} dx + \mu\int^\infin_{-\infin} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;
We now see that the right integral is the complete integral over a normal pmf. This is therefore 1.
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}(-\sigma^2)\left[e^{-( x - \mu )^2 /2 \sigma^2} \right]^\infin_{-\infin} + \mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}(-\sigma^2)[0-0] + \mu&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}[X] = \mu&lt;/math&gt;

====Variance====
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) =\operatorname{E}[(X-{E}[X])^2]= \int^\infin_{-\infin} (x-\mu)^2 \cdot f(x) dx = \int^\infin_{-\infin}(x-\mu)^2 \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{- \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \right) ^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;
We let &lt;math&gt;w={x-\mu \over \sigma \sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) = \int^\infin_{-\infin}\sigma^2 2w^2 \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-w^2} \sigma \sqrt{2} dw =  \frac{2\sigma^2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int^\infin_{-\infin}w \cdot w e^{-w^2} dw&lt;/math&gt;
We now use integration by parts with ''u=w'' and ''v=(-1/2)e^(-w^2)''
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) =  \frac{2\sigma^2}{\sqrt{\pi}}  \left(\left[w {-1 \over 2} e^{-w^2}\right]^\infin_{-\infin}-\int^\infin_{-\infin} {-1 \over 2} e^{-w^2} dw\right)&lt;/math&gt;
We see that the the bracketed term is zero by [[w:L'Hôpital's rule|L'Hôpital's rule]].
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) =  \frac{2\sigma^2}{\sqrt{\pi}}  \left({1 \over 2}\int^\infin_{-\infin}  e^{-w^2} dw\right)&lt;/math&gt;
Now we use the Gaussian integral again
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(X) =  \frac{2\sigma^2}{\sqrt{\pi}} {1 \over 2}\sqrt{\pi}= \sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the time of King Saul's reign, Saul was determined to kill David.  As a result, David fled to the wilderness where he was joined by a band of men.  David demonstrated patience, cunning, and forgiveness.  He was willing to let the Lord place him on the throne in His own time rather than taking matters into his own hands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like David, Elijah fled to the wilderness to escape the wrath of the king.  He lived by the brook Cherith for two years during a time of drought.  The Lord provided his food, and his water was supplied by the brook.  When the brook dried up, Elijah was sent to Zaraphath, and was present when the Lord performed a miracle for a widow and her son living there.  Elijah lived with this widow until the drought ended.

:''John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.'' '''Matthew 3:4 NIV'''  

It takes a wilderness leader to be able to make clothing of this sort and to survive on his chosen diet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Jesus' ministry began with a trip to the wilderness where he was tempted by Satan (Matthew 4).    First, Satan suggested that Jesus use His power to satisfy his physical hunger; this was a temptation to use His divine power to satisfy His own needs.  Second, he suggested that Jesus leap from a high place, so that the angels would catch him; this was a temptation to use His divine power to glorify Himself.  Third, he told Jesus that if He would worship him, he would release his claim on the world; this was the temptation to admit that Satan's charges were correct, and that God's law was unfair.

Jesus overcame the temptations, quoting scripture to refute Satan on each point.  Jesus used the time He spent in the wilderness to commune with His Father, and to lay out His mission.  We too can use time spent in the wilderness to do the same.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Bread|Bread]]
==Ingredients==

* 1¼ [[Cookbook:cup|cup]]s warm [[Cookbook:water|water]]
* 2 packages dry [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 tablespoon melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1½ [[Cookbook:teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3½ cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] slivered [[Cookbook:Pepperoni|pepperoni]]
* ½ cup shredded [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]

==Procedure==

'''Dutch Oven Method'''

# Stir yeast and sugar into warm water. Let stand until bubbly.
# Add the salt and about half the flour so the dough can be handled.
# Knead on lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, adding flour only if necessary.
# Cover the ball of dough and let sit 10-15 minutes.
# Roll into 14x16-inch rectangle.
# Spread with slivered pepperoni, cheese, and herbs of your choice.
# Sprinkle liberally with fresh grated black pepper.
# Roll as you would a jellyroll, sealing edge by [[Cookbook:Pinch|pinching]]. Form the roll into a circle.
# Put in 14-inch [[Cookbook:Dutch Oven|Dutch oven]].
# Let rise.
# Place 11 charcoal briquettes on bottom and 17 on top.
# Time/temperature: see &quot;Notes&quot; below.
# Brush with melted butter.

'''Conventional Oven Method'''
# Place in a well-greased round pan. A cast iron fry pan works well.
# Let rise for one hour.
# [[Cookbook:Bake|Bake]] at [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|375°F]] for one hour.
# Brush with melted butter.

==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Rising bread requires warmth. Cool or dry weather inhibits the process. When outside temperatures are too cool for breads to rise, place 3-4 hot coals on top of the oven with bread inside. If it's windy, provide a windbreak.
* Start baking breads slightly before reaching the &quot;double&quot; stage. As the oven heats, the dough continues to rise. Have the bottom heat ready to go when the bread is. Add top heat immediately. When bread is ⅔ baked, take off bottom heat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These are things that will be needed by the group.  Usually, a Pathfinder club will purchase these items.
* First aid kits
* Medical release forms (signed by guardians)
* Sleeping tents - enough to separate the boys and girls.
* Kitchen tent/canopy
* Dining tent/canopy
* Camp stoves
** Fuel for the stoves
* Dishes
** Plates
** Cups
** Bowls
** Eating Utensils
** Mesh hosiery bags, clothes pins, and clothes line - the dishes go in the mesh bags after washing them, and then the bags clip to the clothesline.  This allows them to dry.  Each plate, cup, bowl, knife, fork, and spoon should be numbered with a permanent marker, and each camper (including staff) should be assigned a number.  This will make every camper accountable for their own dishes.  
* Cooking Supplies
** Pots and pans
** Spatula
** Ladle
** Serving/stirring spoons
** Salad bowls
** Can opener
** Knives
** Cutting board
* Fire Equipment
** Matches or lighter
** Firewood, kindling, tinder
** Fire Extinguisher
** Axe/saw/hatchet
** Shovel
* Storage tubs - These should be numbered, and an alphabetized list of the contents of each should be attached.  If the tubs are clear, the lists can be taped to the inside and read from the outside.  A master alphabetized list denoting in which tub an item belongs should also be kept in the kitchen.  This makes finding things a ''lot'' easier.  It does require discipline though.  Storage tubs can double as dish sinks.  
* Broom/dustpan
* Tarps
* Large water jugs
* Coolers and ice
* Food
* Tool kit
* Duct tape

# Place in a well-greased round pan.
# Let rise until doubled.
# Bake in conventional oven for one hour. (350°F)


==Tips, Notes, and Variations==

* Rising bread requires warmth. Cool or dry weather inhibits the process. When outside temperatures are too cool for breads to rise, place 3-4 hot coals on top of the oven with bread inside. If it's windy, provide a windbreak.
* Start baking breads slightly before reaching the &quot;double&quot; stage. As the oven heats, the dough continues to rise. Have the bottom heat ready to go when the bread is. Add top heat immediately. When bread is ⅔ baked, take off bottom heat.

Fortran 2003 is the latest standard of Fortran. This book will focus on modern Fortran, and it will not cover the obsolescent features of Fortran 77 and earlier standards.

== Hello World ==
Here is a Hello World program in Fortran.

&lt;pre&gt;
program hello
   implicit none
   write (*,*) &quot;Hello, world.&quot;
end program hello
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &quot;implicit none&quot; statement forces the programmer to declare all variables, which is considered good style. Fortran has integer, character, real, complex, and logical data types. The following program illustrates their use.

&lt;pre&gt;
program data_types
   implicit none
   integer :: i
   real :: x
   logical :: tf
   complex :: z
   i = 3
   x = 3.0
   z = (3.0,3.0)
   tf = .true.
   write (*,*) &quot;i =&quot;,i,&quot; x =&quot;,x,&quot; z =&quot;,z,&quot; tf = &quot;,tf
end program data_types
&lt;/pre&gt;

output:  i = 3  x = 3.  z = (3.,3.)  tf =  T

== arithmetic operators ==
Fortran has the arithmetic operators +, -, /,*, and ** (for exponentiation). The output of

&lt;pre&gt;
program xx
   implicit none
   write (*,*) 2+3,2-3,2/3,4*3,2**3
end program xx
&lt;/pre&gt;

is

 5 -1 0 12 8

== arrays ==
Fortran 90 and later versions have powerful functionality for arrays. The following program demonstrates some features of arrays. By default, array elements are numbered from 1, not 0, as in C or C++.

&lt;pre&gt;
program xarray
   ! demonstrate array constructor and intrinsic functions
   implicit none
   integer, parameter :: n = 3
   integer :: vec(n)
   vec = (/9,4,1/)          ! set vec(1) to 9, vec(2) to 4, vec(3) to 1
   write (*,*) &quot;vec = &quot;,vec ! print each element of vec
   write (*,*) &quot;vec(1) = &quot;,vec(1),&quot;, vec(3) =&quot;,vec(3) ! print the 1st and 3rd elements
   write (*,*) &quot;size(vec), sum(vec), product(vec) = &quot;, &amp;
                size(vec), sum(vec), product(vec)
   write (*,*) &quot;minval(vec), maxval(vec) = &quot;,minval(vec),maxval(vec)
   vec = vec + 2            ! add 2 to each element of vec
   write (*,*) &quot;vec = &quot;,vec ! print each element of vec
   vec = vec**2             ! square each element of vec
   write (*,*) &quot;vec = &quot;,vec ! print each element of vec
end program xarray
&lt;/pre&gt;

output:

 vec =  9 4 1
 vec(1) =  9 , vec(3) = 1
 size(vec), sum(vec), product(vec) =  3 14 36
 minval(vec), maxval(vec) =  1 9
 vec =  11 6 3
 vec =  121 36 9

== loops ==
Fortran uses do loops for iteration. For example, the program

&lt;pre&gt;
program xloop
   implicit none
   integer :: i
   do i=1,3
      write (*,*) i,i**2
   end do
   write (*,*) &quot;i=&quot;,i
   do i=1,4,2
      write (*,*) i
   end do
   write (*,*) &quot;i=&quot;,i
end program xloop

&lt;/pre&gt;

gives output

 1 1
 2 4
 3 9
 i= 4
 1
 3
 i= 5

because within the first loop, variable i takes on values between 1 and 3 with step size of 1, and in the second loop the step size is 2. After completing the loop the value of i is its last value before leaving the loop plus the step size.

=== comparison operators ===
Fortran has the comparison operators &lt; &lt;= /= == &gt;= &gt; , where /= means &quot;not equal&quot; and the other operators have the usual meanings. The program

&lt;pre&gt;
program xcompare
   implicit none
   write (*,*) 1&lt;0,1&lt;=0,1==0,1/=0,1&gt;=0,1&gt;0
end program xcompare
&lt;/pre&gt;

has output

 F F F T T T

=== do ===
One can have a DO loop without a counter variable, in which case an EXIT statement will be needed to leave the loop, as shown in the following program

&lt;pre&gt;
program xfibonacci
   ! print Fibonacci numbers up to max_fib
   implicit none
   integer, parameter :: max_fib = 10
   integer            :: i,fib,fib1,fib2
   i    = 0
   fib  = 0
   fib1 = 0
   fib2 = 0
   write (*,*) &quot;Fibonacci numbers &lt;= &quot;,max_fib
   do
      if (fib &gt; max_fib) exit
      write (*,*) fib
      i = i + 1
      if (i &gt; 1) then
         fib  = fib1 + fib2
      else
         fib = 1
      end if
      fib2 = fib1
      fib1 = fib
   end do
end program xfibonacci
&lt;/pre&gt;

Declaring max_fib a parameter means that its value cannot be changed in the rest of the program.

=== nested loops ===
Loops can be nested, as shown in the following program

&lt;pre&gt;
program xnest
   implicit none
   integer :: i,j
   do i=1,3
      do j=1,2
         write (*,*) &quot;i,j=&quot;,i,j
      end do
   end do
end program xnest
&lt;/pre&gt;

which gives output

 i,j= 1 1
 i,j= 1 2
 i,j= 2 1
 i,j= 2 2
 i,j= 3 1
 i,j= 3 2

== functions and return values ==
A function can be used to return a value depending on zero or more arguments. The code below shows a function that converts from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.

&lt;pre&gt;
module convert_mod
   implicit none
contains
   function cels_from_fahr(degrees_fahr) result(degrees_cels)
   real, intent(in) :: degrees_fahr
   real             :: degrees_cels
   degrees_cels = (degrees_fahr-32)/1.8
   end function cels_from_fahr
end module convert_mod

program xtemperature
   use convert_mod, only: cels_from_fahr
   real    :: deg
   integer :: i
   write (*,&quot;(2a10)&quot;) &quot;degrees_F&quot;,&quot;degrees_C&quot;
   do i=12,100,20
      deg = real(i)
      write (*,&quot;(2f10.1)&quot;) deg,cels_from_fahr(deg)
   end do
end program xtemperature
&lt;/pre&gt;

Output:

 degrees_F degrees_C
      12.0     -11.1
      32.0       0.0
      52.0      11.1
      72.0      22.2
      92.0      33.3

== subroutines ==

A subroutine cannot be used in an expression and is invoked with a call statement, as demonstrated in the program below, which 
gives the same output as the program above.

&lt;pre&gt;
module convert_mod
   implicit none
contains
   subroutine cels_from_fahr(degrees_fahr,degrees_cels)
   real, intent(in)  :: degrees_fahr
   real, intent(out) :: degrees_cels
   degrees_cels = (degrees_fahr-32)/1.8
   end subroutine cels_from_fahr
end module convert_mod

program xtemperature
   use convert_mod, only: cels_from_fahr
   real    :: deg_f,deg_c
   integer :: i
   write (*,&quot;(2a10)&quot;) &quot;degrees_F&quot;,&quot;degrees_C&quot;
   do i=12,100,20
      deg_f = real(i)
      call cels_from_fahr(deg_f,deg_c)
      write (*,&quot;(2f10.1)&quot;) deg_f,deg_c
   end do
end program xtemperature
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basics==

In order to work in Japan as a non-citizen, '''you need a visa'''. Visas are described in detail later in this guide, but the most important things to know are:

*'''You need a job before you can get a working visa.'''
*You generally need a bachelor's degree or a large amount of work experience to get the visa.

==Teaching in Japan==

The most common profession among native English speakers in Japan is '''teaching English'''.

There are a number of ways to teach in Japan. The most basic is to teach on a freelance basis, where the teacher and student(s) meet at a coffee shop or other location for private lessons. Compensation for this sort of teaching varies, but is generally between ¥1,500 and ¥5,000 an hour. However, since there is no guaranteed source of income through this method, people seeking full-time employment usually look for a position at some sort of school.

===Language schools===

Japan has a number of specialized language schools, which may cater to adults, children or both. The largest of these schools, such as NOVA, AEON, ECC, GEOS and GABA, often recruit teachers from overseas and place them within Japan. These schools provide an easy way for a first-timer to come to Japan, but they may demand stressful working hours, and the employment contract may try to restrict your activities outside the workplace.

There are also many smaller language schools which hire teachers on a more ad-hoc basis. While these often provide a more easygoing work environment, they rarely hire outside Japan, and they often want an applicant to have a work visa before applying.

Starting salaries at private language schools are about ¥200,000 to 250,000/month; part time wage per hour ranges from ¥1,500 to ¥4,000. Only a bachelor's degree is generally required, and some teachers get by without even a bachelor's degree if they are otherwise eligible to work in Japan (e.g. by having a Japanese spouse).

While English is the most popular language by far, Mandarin Chinese teachers are in rapidly increasing demand, and other languages such as French, German and Korean are also taught in many locations.

===Schools===

Another avenue for teachers who would rather work with children is to teach at an elementary, junior high or senior high school.

One popular avenue for doing this is the [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/jet/index.html JET Programme], a government-run program which places foreigners under 40 in &quot;assistant language teacher&quot; positions at public schools or local boards of education. The JET Programme provides special orientations for living in Japan, and is a common stepping-stone into the country for newcomers. However, the program is fairly competitive, not all nationalities may participate, and many areas of Japan have withdrawn from the program in recent years, instead opting to recruit trained foreign teachers directly.

Outside of JET, which requires no particular teaching experience, schools often demand some teaching experience or teaching qualification. Salaries range from ¥250,000 to ¥300,000/month for entry-level jobs; experienced teachers may make a bit more.

===Universities===

Universities offer higher pay than schools, but also demand a better resume: you will need at least a master's degree to teach at a university. Note that foreigners generally do not receive tenure-track positions at Japanese universities: instead, they are hired as lecturers on fixed-term contracts.

==Professional careers==

===Finance===
Tokyo is one of the financial capitals of the world, and many foreigners are employed in investment banks and securities firms which offer high salaries and good benefits.

The most common way to get a position in the Tokyo finance industry is to join a firm overseas and then be transferred to Japan. This is not the ''only'' way to manage things, however: many firms, particularly smaller ones, hire foreigners directly in Japan. These positions are usually filled through personal contacts or through &quot;headhunters&quot; (executive search consultants).

Many finance positions demand fluency in Japanese, and a good number demand fluency in a third language as well.

===Law===

Legal services are also clustered around Tokyo, although there are a few firms in Osaka, Nagoya and other major cities. Most &quot;serious&quot; work for foreign lawyers and paralegals is in a handful of multinational law firms and investment banks in Tokyo, which have fairly high hiring standards and often seek both experience ''and'' language ability. Japanese law firms employ some entry-level foreigners to proofread contracts and memoranda, and employ some more experienced foreign lawyers to work as handlers for foreign clients.

===IT===

The IT industry is big in Japan and employs many foreigners with programming and engineering backgrounds.

Naturally, a technical background is a must. Most foreigners who work in the Japanese IT industry also need to know Japanese on a basic level. Besides daily communication, a command of the language is necessary in order to navigate and program local computer systems, since Japanese systems have issues of character encoding, IMEs, and other features that often do not exist on Western systems.

==Other opportunities==

===Starting a business===

Thanks to recent legal changes, it is now easier than ever to start a business in Japan. However, this is probably not a task for those who are unaccustomed to managing a business or working in Japan.

The Japan External Trade Organization, an organ of the Japanese government, has [http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/ published a guide on setting up business in Japan]. For a basic office-based business you should anticipate an initial investment of at least ¥10,000,000 to cover rent and legal paperwork. If you are entering Japan for the purpose of starting the business, the business must also meet certain conditions of scale in order to be the basis for your working visa as a &quot;business manager.&quot; Generally, this means having at least two employees in addition to yourself (often a Japanese manager and secretary).

===Bars and restaurants===

Restaurants, bars and nightclubs have long been a vocation of foreigners in Japan. However, because there is no visa for waiters and bartenders, you will need another form of work eligibility (such as a spouse visa or working holiday visa) in order to obtain such a job legally.

===Hostessing===

One potentially lucrative market for young foreign women is the &quot;hostess bar&quot; industry. Hostesses are often compared to the traditional ''geisha''–entertainers who get paid to &quot;charm&quot; men. Hostessing is not prostitution, and sexual services are not part of the job description, which could be better described as &quot;paid flirting.&quot; While hostessing pays well, it is not a particularly secure job, and it requires a certain degree of appearance and charisma. One good essay on the hostessing experience is [http://akasenkuiki.homestead.com/files/babies.html &quot;Mama-san's Babies&quot;] by Sarah Dale. Male &quot;hosts&quot; are also in some demand nowadays, although this market is much smaller.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: etc) → etc.) using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The details vary for every type of tent there is, so we provide only general tips here.  First, carefully read the instructions that came with your tent.  If it's a new tent, '''keep the instructions.'''  You might be surprised how easy it is to forget which pole goes where.

First, unpack the tent and spread it on the ground.  Some people like to put the ground cloth under the tent, and others like to put it inside.  If you're going to put it beneath the tent, spread it out first.  Before doing anything else, lie down on the ground cloth and test each sleeping area.  If you feel a lump get rid of it now.

Then lay out the tent's canopy (that is, the cloth part that is not the fly).  Find the door and orient it where you want it.  Then stake it down.  This will prevent the wind from blowing it away while you are trying to raise it.  Slide the poles into the tubes, but do not raise the tent until the main poles (usually two of them) are all in place.  Then raise them together.  There are usually aluminum &quot;hooks&quot; located at the stake-down straps and shaped somewhat like a question mark.  They are usually a couple of inches long, and are there to slip the pole ends over.  Once all the pole are in place, throw the fly over the tent, being careful that the up side is up and the front side is to the front.  

Flies often have elastic ropes that attach to plastic clips near the pole anchors, and they also generally have a rope at the four major corners.  These should be anchored such that the fly is held off the tent's canopy, usually by staking them down or tying them to a tree.  In the &quot;olden days&quot; a taut line hitch would be used to tighten these ropes, but these days the ropes are fitted with a three-hole plastic strap.  The end of the rope passes through the bottom-most hole and is tied off with a stopper knot.  From there, the rope goes to the anchor (tree, stake, etc.), and passes through the middle hole, and then again through the top hole.  The plastic strap can then be slid up and down the rope to adjust the tension.  Do not over-tension these ropes - they should have some give so that the tent can move a little with the wind.  If they are too tight, the wind will rip the stakes from the ground or topple the tent.

If possible, do not strike the tent until it has dried.  If you can, wait until the morning dew has evaporated.  This is, of course, not always possible - it could be pouring rain when it's time to go, so you'll have to strike a wet tent.  If your tent is wet when you strike it, you will need to set it up to let it dry as soon as you get back.  '''Do not store a wet tent.''' It will be quickly ruined with mold and mildew.  

To strike the tent first inspect the inside, being sure that everything has been removed.  Check the loops in the ceiling (coat hangers tend to hide there) and the &quot;stuff&quot; bags on the walls (glasses and keys tend to hide there).  Then sweep the tent.  Once everything has been removed, pull off the fly, and stow it inside the tent (spread it out as flat as you can).  If you stand next to the tent's door, you can pull the fly off the canopy and stuff it directly inside without  it ever hitting the outside ground (and thus picking up dirt, leaves, and moisture).  Stowing the fly inside also avoids the sad problem of cramming the canopy and poles into the tent's duffel, and then noticing the that the fly still needs to get crammed in there too.  It's one less thing to roll up.

Then let down the poles.  Carefully remove the poles from the canopy and fold them up.  If the tent poles are sectional tubes with a long piece of elastic running through them all, it is better to push the poles out of the canopy rather than trying to pull them through.  Pulling on them merely separates the sections and may break the elastic.  Broken elastic will have to be repaired before the tent can be pitched again, because the elastic actually holds the poles together.

Once the poles have been stowed, remove the stakes and carefully fold the tent.  Put everything back into the bag it came in.

==Ingredients==

* 1 kilo strong bread flour
* 21 grams dried yeast
* 650 ml tepid water
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 35 grams sugar.


==Procedure==

# Preheat oven 180 degrees. 
# Mix all the dry ingredients together, add the water and mix well - use your hands. 
# Work into a large pliable ball. Cut in half. 
# Roll the 1st half the ball out on a floured board, to approx 1/2 inch thick - 12 - 15inches wide and as long as you can get it within those dimensions. 

Filling - whatever you like. For the chocolate and banana filling use Nutella or other chocolate spread and spread it thickly and evenly down and across the dough,leaving an inch or so free on all sides. Cut 3 or 4 bananas into 1 inch thick slices and cover the chocolate spread with the slices. Sprinkle with chopped nuts of your choice if desired - almonds, walnuts etc. Add chocolate chips if liked. Take one of the long sides of the dough and roll it inwards, keep rolling - making sure the filling stays &quot;tucked in&quot; - arrange the bread on a baking tray - either laid out straight or curled around on itself, whichever you prefer. Brush lightly with olive oil - sprinkle with more chopped nuts if desired - leave aside in warm place to prove for 30 minutes then bake for 30 - 35 mins.
Use the 2nd half of the dough to make either a 2nd sweet bread or a savory bread, use bacon and egg - Cheese and onion - whatever takes your fancy - treat as above.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many ways to prepare an area where you will build your campfire.  If you are in an established camping area, look for a place where a fire has already been built.  Do not start a fire in a new area if there are fire pits already available.  If you must build a fire in a new area, dig out any sod first, and lay it aside.  Keep it in the shade (perhaps beneath a vehicle) and water it every day so it does not dry out (perhaps with your rinse water).  You will replace it before you leave.  If there is no sod, clear out all the duff and debris so that only inorganic material is in the fire ring.  Clear an area double the diameter of the intended fire.  Then place stones inside this ring, building a small wall as it were.  Try to fit the stones so that there are no gaps, or only small gaps.  The stone ring should be six to eight inches high, and it should go all the way around the circle.  Before you lay the fire, make sure you have a means to extinguish it nearby and ready to go.  This could be a fire extinguisher, a bucket of sand, or a bucket of water.  Means of extinguishing the fire should be on hand ''before'' the fire is lit.  The fire ring should then be ready for a fire.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Visas==

If you plan to work or study in Japan, you should obtain a visa before traveling to Japan. Japanese visas are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) through Japanese embassies and consulates in your home country. MOFA maintains a [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html comprehensive guide to visas] on its website.

Your employer or school in Japan will most likely provide you with a &quot;Certificate of Eligibility.&quot; This is a document issued by the Ministry of Justice, which shows that you have fulfilled the legal criteria to obtain permission to enter Japan. '''The certificate does not entitle you to enter Japan.''' Instead, it expedites the process of obtaining a visa and obtaining landing permission upon your arrival.

Once you have a Certificate of Eligibility, you can provide it to your nearest Japanese embassy or consulate, along with a visa application form and your passport. Visas are usually issued within a few business days, unless there is an obvious problem with the Certificate of Eligibility: in that case, the embassy will have to contact the Ministry of Justice in Tokyo, which will delay the visa application.

If you do not have a Certificate of Eligibility, you must submit additional documentation to the embassy in order to obtain a visa. The required documentation varies based on which type of visa you seek. The MOFA guide to visas contains [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/05.html a complete list of required documents].

Once you enter Japan, the Ministry of Justice will grant you &quot;landing permission&quot; to engage in the activities provided for by your visa. At this point, any issues regarding the legality of your stay in Japan will be handled by the Immigration Bureau, which is a unit of the Ministry of Justice.

===Working holiday program===

Nationals of Australia, Canada, France, Germany, South Korea, New Zealand and the United Kingdom can take advantage of Japan's [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/w_holiday/programme.html &quot;working holiday&quot; visa]. You do not need a Japanese contact to get this visa: it is available to just about everyone between 18 and 30. However, it has a maximum duration of one year (18 Months for Australia), and cannot be extended beyond that. Holders are also prohibited from working in nightclubs and similar establishments.

===Visa waiver program===

It is also possible to enter Japan without a visa. [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/02.html#a 62 countries] currently have visa waiver arrangements with Japan, under which nationals of those countries may enter Japan without a visa. The permitted stay ranges from 14 days to 6 months depending on the visitor's nationality: the most common period is 90 days or 3 months. However, a visa waiver bars the visitor from engaging in &quot;paid activities&quot; within Japan.

A number of foreigners stay in Japan for extended periods without a visa by leaving and re-entering Japan every 3 months. While this is not technically illegal, it is frowned upon by immigration officers, and some foreigners who attempt it are temporarily detained when they return to Japan.

==Flying to Japan==

Japan has three main international airports: Narita Airport (NRT) near Tokyo, Kansai Airport (KIX) near Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto, and Chubu Centrair Airport (NGO) near Nagoya. Intercontinental flights to Japan are basically limited to these airports, with the bulk of the service using Narita. However, many smaller airports in Japan have direct service to major cities in East Asia. Incheon Airport (ICN) in Korea is a particularly good connecting point for accessing smaller Japanese cities from Europe or the Americas.

Published airfares to Japan (such as those offered by airline websites) tend to be quite high, particularly fares on the two national airlines, JAL and ANA. For cheaper fares, your best bet is to find a Japanese travel agency in your local area. These agents tend to buy seats in bulk at cut rates, and can therefore offer very low fares in comparison with the airlines.

===What to bring===

Japan is a very advanced country, and you can find just about anything you need there. Don't worry about packing every daily necessity. Here are some items you should be sure to bring:

*'''Cash or travelers' checks.''' Wiring money to Japan or accessing your foreign account from a Japanese ATM can be expensive, both due to bank fees and wide exchange rate spreads. Instead, you should bring some money with you to Japan and convert it into yen at the airport. Airport currency kiosks in Japan tend to have the best exchange rates and won't charge you additional fees. There is no legal limit to how much you can bring, but if you are on a student or trainee visa, you will have to declare the amount to Immigration.
*'''Power adapters''' if you have electronics. Japan uses 100V outlets. These are very similar to American 110V outlets, but there are very few three-prong outlets in Japan, so even Americans will need to bring an adapter for any devices which require one. Some items, such as plug-in clocks, will not work properly unless they were designed for 50 Hz. Laptops, cameras and other items built for 110V are usually fine in Japan.
*'''Gifts.''' Small items from your home country are an excellent idea. You don't have to go overboard: a few keychains, refrigerator magnets or postcards will do. People are often curious about where you come from, and a small gift can help build a relationship with them.

You can find a full list of what to bring, what you *could* bring, and what NOT to bring [http://www.survivingnjapan.com/2010/07/moving-to-japan-read-this-first.html here].

===What NOT to bring===

[http://www.narita-airport-customs.go.jp/e/index_e.html Narita Airport Customs] has a fairly thorough guide of what you absolutely cannot bring into Japan:

*'''Drugs'''. Illegal drugs are, of course, right out. You should also avoid bringing '''Vicks inhalers''' or '''Sudafed''', as these drugs are considered to be illegal stimulants in Japan.
*'''Pornography'''. Japan has a thriving porn industry, but it is still illegal to show a person's genitalia in Japan, and any items you have containing frontal nudity will be confiscated if Customs finds them.
*'''Firearms''' and firearm components (including ammunition) cannot be brought into the country.
*'''Counterfeit articles''', including money and designer goods, may be confiscated if Customs finds them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If camping at a commercial campground, bring your own wood or buy some at the camp store.  '''Do not gather firewood from the surrounding forest!'''  Most campgrounds have rules against this, and it is ''not'' only so they can sell you expensive wood.  In a heavily camped area, the forest simply cannot sustain that level of use.  Rule breakers will already have depleted enough of the forest - don't add to their sins!

If there was already a fire ring present, if it is allowed, and you are in the wilderness, gather firewood well away from the campsite.  Do not cut down any trees, live or dead.  Dead trees are an important habitat for many forest creatures.  Instead, look for fallen limbs that are not lying in full contact with the ground and use those.  Wood that is lying fully on the ground will likely be too wet to use as firewood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once you have found a large, dead limb, it is time to cut it loose and drag it to the campsite.  You can do this with either an axe, a hatchet, or a saw.  Be sure you have firm footing before swinging an axe or a hatchet, and be sure no one is within six feet of you to the sides or to the rear, and within twelve feet of you towards your front.  Axe heads have come off before (2 Kings 6:5), and they are very dangerous when they do.  For this reason, it may be better to use a saw.  A saw will also leave more of the wood intact with the log for burning rather than as wood chips that fly all over the place.

If you need to chop a log in half, do not lay it directly on the ground.  Otherwise the axe blows will push the log into the ground.  Instead, lay it on another small log (three inches in diameter is good).  Strike the log to be cut at the point where it is in contact with the supporting log.  Otherwise, the log may flip up and strike you or a bystander.  This can cause a serious injury, so be watchful.  Again, it is better to use a saw.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unless the log you wish to split has been sawn and has a flat end, it will be very difficult to split it.  Steady it on its end, and make sure it can stand on its own.  Instruct everyone to clear away from you, and do '''not''' swing the axe if anyone is near.  Grip the end of the axe handle with both hands, and gently lay the blade of the axe on the top of the log, on the edge nearest where you are standing.  Fully extend your arms when you do this, and back up if necessary.  Spread your feet apart by about the same distance as your shoulders are wide, and make sure your footing is firm.  If you are right handed, slide your right hand towards the head of the axe as you draw it towards yourself.  Take aim, and draw the axe over your head, bringing it down mightily as your right hand slides down the handle.  The right hand should meet the left about the same time the axe strikes the log.  Note  how the axe strikes the wood farther away from you than where you were resting it at the beginning.  This is why you should aim for the edge nearest you.  If you overshoot the log, you will bring the handle down on the edge of the log and damage the axe.  Do that enough, and you'll need to replace the handle.

When splitting a log, try to divide it into two equal masses.  If you try to split off a smaller segment, the split will run out, and the piece you remove will be smaller on one end than on the other.

To split a small piece of wood (less than {{units|10 cm|4 inches}} in diameter), place the blade of a hatchet on the end of the log, raise the log and the hatchet together, and bring them down sharply on another log or a rock.  When they strike the second log, the hatchet's momentum will drive it into the log.  Raise the pair again, and strike repeatedly until the log splits apart.  '''Do not steady the log with one hand and strike it with the other.''' If you miss the log and hit your hand, you will cause an unnecessary emergency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Housing==

Finding a good place to live is difficult no matter where you are, but it is particularly difficult in Japan. Apartments and houses tend to be very small by American standards, and rather cramped by European standards.

===Apartments===

There is no shortage of apartments in Japan: you can find &quot;for rent&quot; signs on every other city block in Tokyo, and new buildings are constantly being constructed.

The main consideration in getting an apartment is ''money''. Usually, leases are for at least one or two years, and it can be difficult for a landlord to evict a long-term tenant without cause. So getting an apartment in Japan usually requires a ''lot'' of money up front. The up-front money is divided into ''reikin'', a gift to the landlord, and ''shikikin'', a kind of security deposit which is supposed to be refunded but rarely comes back. ''Reikin'' and ''shikikin'' together usually amount to '''three or four months' rent'''. If you go through a real estate agent to get your apartment, you will need to pay the agent a commission as well, usually equal to one month's rent.

Some apartments in Japan are as small as 9 square meters (100 square feet)! Usually, the size of an apartment is given in square meters or in ''tatami'' mats. The configuration of an apartment is usually described using the following codes:

*ワンルーム (''wan-rūmu'') denotes a one-room (studio) apartment.
*A &quot;1K&quot; has a bedroom and a tiny but separate kitchen.
*A &quot;1DK&quot; has a bedroom and a kitchen large enough to eat in.
*A &quot;1LDK&quot; has a bedroom and a larger kitchen which can accommodate both a table and a couch.
*&quot;2K&quot; usually denotes an apartment with two bedrooms and a small kitchen, but some landlords or agents may use the term to refer to something more like a 1DK (in which the kitchen is part of the smaller &quot;bedroom&quot;).
*After this, you have 2DK, 2LDK, 3DK, 3LDK, etc.

Naturally, if you plan on spending much time at home, you will likely want a 1LDK or larger apartment. In any location within 45 minutes of central Tokyo, a 1LDK costs at least ¥70,000/month in rent alone, and the cost of rent goes up dramatically in the most popular areas of the central city. One-room and 1K apartments are often much cheaper, however. The cost of rent also goes down if you live in a more distant location.


===Monthly mansions===

An alternative to an apartment is a &quot;monthly mansion&quot; or &quot;weekly mansion.&quot; These are designed for shorter stays and do not require any deposit up front. To compensate for this, the monthly rent is about ¥20,000 to ¥50,000 higher than an equivalent apartment.

===Guest houses===

A &quot;guest house&quot; is a building shared by several people. Tenants in a guest house have their own bedrooms, but usually share bathrooms and living space. Some guest houses are actual houses in residential areas: others may be set up in apartment blocks or in converted commercial space. A number of guest houses are only occupied by foreigners: these are often called &quot;gaijin houses.&quot;

There are obvious privacy and security concerns inherent in living in a guest house, and the other tenants may be insufferable. However, these tend to be the cheapest form of medium to long-term housing in major cities. A guest house room can be had near major train stations in central Tokyo for as little as ¥65,000/month.

==Hankou/Seals==
Hankou or (signature) seals are carved stamps used throughout Japan for official matters. They are legally considered as an equivalent to your handwritten signature and are used whenever you are required to sign an official document (lease, mortgage, will etc). You will need to purchase your own hankou if you intend to stay in Japan, and you are obliged to register the hankou with your local city hall.

==Alien registration==

All aliens who plan to stay in Japan for more than 90 days must register with their local city hall during their first 90 days in Japan. Registration is a relatively simple procedure. The forms are available in English, Chinese and Korean, and you only need to bring your passport and two photographs (the photographs can usually be purchased from a machine at city hall).

Once you are registered, you will be issued a Certificate of Alien Registration, known colloquially as a &quot;gaijin card.&quot; You are required by law to carry either the card or your passport at all times. Japanese police may ask you to show your card from time to time, so you should carry it any time you are in public.

==Banking==

===Opening an account===

Once you have a Certificate of Alien Registration, you can go to a Japanese bank and ask to open an account. There are many banks in Japan. The largest are Mitsubishi-Tokyo UFJ (MTU), Sumitomo Mitsui (SMBC) and Mizuho. In addition to these, many foreigners use Citibank (which has a full presence in Japan) or Shinsei Bank (a Japanese bank with foreign management and extensive service in English). Another option is Yucho Bank, a savings institution tied to the post office.

Some banks insist that you must live in Japan for a certain period before opening an account. This is incorrect, and if a bank denies you an account on these grounds you should find another bank.

===Using your account===

Some banks, particularly the large ones, give you an ATM card and send you a monthly statement in the mail–a familiar process for most foreigners. Smaller banks may still follow the &quot;traditional&quot; approach of giving you a '''passbook''' instead. To check your balance, you insert the passbook into an ATM, and the numbers are printed directly on the passbook.

Cheques are rarely used in Japan. Instead, you will probably pay your bills and receive your pay through '''furikomi''', an interbank transfer system. You can send a furikomi from an ATM, or through online banking if your bank offers it. There is usually a fee of 100-500 yen to send a furikomi.

To make a cash deposit, you insert the bills directly into the ATM, which counts the money and confirms the total before depositing it into your account.

To make a cash withdrawal, you can use your bank's ATM or another ATM within the same network. MTU, SMBC and Shinsei all have large nationwide ATM networks, including 24-hour machines inside convenience stores. If you go with a smaller bank, you may be restricted to that bank's ATMs, which may have tight operating hours.

===Sending and receiving money internationally===

There are several ways to transfer money from a foreign account to your Japanese account:

#'''International wire transfer''' can be difficult due to money laundering countermeasures. Some banks only allow you to send an international wire in person. Check with your institution at home about the rules and fees. There will probably be fees to send the wire, to receive the wire and to convert the money into yen.
#'''Writing a cheque to yourself''' may be cheaper and easier than sending a wire, but usually takes much longer (as much as five weeks).
#You can also withdraw cash from your foreign account at a post office ATM, then deposit the cash in your Japanese account. This avoids fees on the Japanese end, but depending on the foreign bank's pricing, you may lose quite a bit of money in ATM fees and the exchange rate spread.

Some banks in Japan now offer accounts in multiple currencies. If you have such an account, you can receive a wire from the US in dollars, then convert the money to yen whenever you want to. This is useful for taking advantage of exchange rate fluctuations, and may also give you a better exchange rate than an ATM.

==Health Insurance==
Health insurance is obligatory for all permanent employees and is automatically deducted from your wage packet. It goes towards the maintenance of the National health system and entitles you to free healthcare throughout Japan.

==Cell Theory==
Some of the exceptions to the cell theory aren't really exceptions. Multi-nucleated cells are still cells.

I'd also like to see support on that statement &quot;Some biologists consider unicellular organisms to be acellular.&quot;

I suppose you need to add a definition of a cell.


Corrected your misspelling of Schwann as Swan.
Here is the wikipedia entry for it.

Right. And one reason exceptions seem necessary is that part 5 about DNA is not actually part of the cell theory.[[Special:Contributions/63.249.108.159|63.249.108.159]] ([[User talk:63.249.108.159|talk]]) 23:02, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you remember, the game we've looked at&amp;mdash;the Prisoner's Dilemma&amp;mdash;had to be explained with the use of a story. However this is not only very verbose and imprecise but also impossible to do for many games that are simply too complicated. One simple way of showing a game is by using a ''game matrix''

This is really a table of ''utility''. Utility is the amount of happiness an agent (player) gets from a particular outcome, or ''payoff''. 

In order to create a game matrix, we first need to work out the utility values. We assign the payoffs that are least attractive to a player low values and payoffs that are attractive to the player high payoffs. Initially&lt;ref&gt;Later when talking about expected utility we will treat these values as &quot;cardinal&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;, these are what we call &quot;ordinal&quot; utility values, not &quot;cardinal&quot; utility values. This means that a payoff of 10 isn't necessarily twice as good as one of 5. In fact, there is no difference between the two following utility values lists when talking about ''ordinal'' values:

{|
! Setup 1 || Setup 2
|-
|
 Event A = Utility of 1
 Event B = Utility of 2
 Event C = Utility of 3
|
 Event A = Utility of 1
 Event B = Utility of 1,000,000
 Event C = Utility of 230,000,000,000,000
|}

It's just that the first list is far more concise. 
Remembering that we go from lowest level of attraction to highest, let's assign payoffs to the Prisoner's Dilemma game.

 10 years in jail  =  1
 7 years in jail   =  2
 2 years in jail   =  3
 Get off free      =  4

Now we can arrange a table that shows what happens when each player chooses different options.

{{bimatrix|title=Prisoner's Dilemma|s1=Confess|s2=Stay Silent|u11=(2,2)|u12=(4,1)|u21=(1,4)|u22=(3,3)}}

It should be clear soon how to read this table. Player 1 has two rows, &quot;Confess&quot; and &quot;Stay Silent&quot;, and Player 2 has two columns marked the same. Where a column and a row intersect are the '''payoffs'''. Thus when Player 1's &quot;Confess&quot; row and Player 2's &quot;Stay Silent&quot; column intersect (which means in terms of the game, when Player 1 confesses and Player 2 stays silent) the payoff (4,1) is awarded. This means that Player 1 (whose personal payoff comes first in the brackets) gets a payout of 4&amp;mdash;his highest payoff&amp;mdash;and Player 2 gets a payout of 1&amp;mdash;the lowest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Definition: ==
 
A Nash Equilibrium is a set of mixed strategies for finite, non-cooperative games between two or more players whereby no player can improve his or her payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. Each player's strategy is an 'optimal' response based on the anticipated rational strategy of the other player(s) in the game.

Nash outlined a new paradigm for mathematical and economic thinkers with his pioneering use of Equilibrium Theory. He had been accepted to study in New Jersey from his native West Virginia on a Scholarship for (Pure) Mathematics, and worked briefly under the advice of Albert Einstein. Many of Nash's contemporaries refer to him as a (post)modern day 'genius' for his reformations to some of Adam Smith's views on Economics and when considering his more personal characteristics, including his unorthodox teaching and research procedures, and his past experiences with schizophrenia.

== Equilibrium Theory: ==

The Nash Theorem maintains its focus on rivalries with mutual gain; a perceptual focus of Nash's mathematical vision found in the light of Leon Walras' General Equilibrium Theory (published 1874) and John von Neumann's and Oskar Morgenstern's Theory of Games (1944), now simply called Game Theory. Nash later established his own idea of dominant strategy equilibria through maximization solutions for zero-sum games. He did this with original mathematical techniques to demonstrate the existence of methods for finding a measurable equilibrium in a general class of non-cooperative games.

Other academic theorists used the concept of 'equilibrium' in the 19th century (Maxwell, Walras, Gibbs), for chemical and economic equilibrium in the early stages of the 20th century (van der Waals, Onnes, Keynes) before Nash used it in the middle of the 20th century. Others improved upon Nash's original formulation in the 1950's and 60's (Selten, Harsanyi) and explored different possible aspects of a General Equilibrium Theory (GET) from the 70's to the 90's (Arrow, Hicks, Debreu). Many students of economics still study GET today. Recent academic applications of equilibrium theory from non-economists (Kolmogorov, S. Nagel), and in directions other than those laid down by the neo-Classicalists (cf. neo-Keynesians below), persist as well. The proposed universality of equilibrium theory (i.e. that all situations or economic conditions can/should be considered in the paradigm of general or specific equilibrium thinking) by some theorists makes it difficult to analyze subjects or objects with(-in) a single interpretive framework, and often demands multiple perspectives or even 'relativized' equilibria to explain and interpret diverse economies across the disciplines. Ordeshook above shows us the reach of Nash's equilibrium theory over disciplinary boundaries, and its relevance for practical mathematical-economic applications; now (post)modern theorists must again find ways to deal with its implications in the 21st century academy. 

The possible theoretical limitations of equilibrium theory have led to disequilibrium neo-Keynesian theories during the last fifty years (Hahn, Fisher). And stubborn questions remain, even with uncertainty: what if there is more than one Nash Equilibrium in a given game; or if the players in a game have incomplete information; or if the rationality thesis fails to clearly convince readers who live beyond the so-called Age of Reason...? How does a unified Nash Equilibrium maintain itself in a theoretically plural academic culture and with increasingly complex indicators and instruments used in the scientific pursuit? Such may be the cases, for example, when turn-of-the-century relativity theories or even practical evolutionism (i.e. applied morphology) in Economics disallow unification on any shared equilibrium goal(s) or value(s). But then again, this message is itself being written in a time of (post)war. 

John Nash can be credited against astonishing odds with making a normative distinction between cooperative and non-cooperative games, and for using mathematical models to support and exemplify his research. But his contribution to theory has become (neo-Nash) a web of explanation(s) and justification(s) far beyond the original conceptions of the author, and has also progressed steadily into the social world—somewhere Nash himself may not have wanted it to go.

}}
Chi-square distribution is related to normal distribution. A chi-square statistic is the sum of a number of independent and standard normal random variables.

Assume that we have n number of random variables ''Z'', that are normally distributed. Therefore, we can write &lt;math&gt; Z \in N(0,1) &lt;/math&gt;. If we square ''Z'' such that &lt;math&gt; Z^2 &lt;/math&gt;, then we get the chi-square distribution &lt;math&gt; Z^2 \in \chi_{1}^2 &lt;/math&gt;. If we sum ''n'' number of &lt;math&gt; \chi_{1}^2 &lt;/math&gt;, we can write

&lt;math&gt;
Y = Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 + ... + Z_n^2 \in \chi_{n}^2
&lt;/math&gt;.

One example could be that we want to know whether the weight of a set of eight apples is normally distributed. Chi-square distribution can be used to test for this. Assume that the apples weigh 88, 93, 110, 76, 78, 121, 92 and 86 grams, and we have knowledge of the mean and the standard deviation weight of all apples. We obtain the normally distributed Z values by subtracting the mean weight (93) and divide by the standard deviation (15.41). For example, the first apple has got &lt;math&gt; Z_1 = \frac{88-93}{15.41} = -0.3245 &lt;/math&gt; using four decimal points. Square all the  Z values, then taking the sum yields a Chi-squared distributed random variable with mean 8 and variance 16.

Now when we have the value of the chi-square statistic ''Y'', we compare it to the critical value of the chi-square distribution at n = 8 degrees of freedom and 95% level of significance which can found in a Chi-square statistical table. The null hypothesis is that the sample of apples is normally distributed. It is rejected if the value of the test statistic is higher than the critical value.

The chi-square distribution is a special case of the [[Statistics/Distributions/Gamma|gamma distribution]], where ''a=2'' and ''p=k/2''. The probability density function is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2^{k/2}\Gamma(k/2)}\; x^{k/2-1} e^{-x/2}\quad x\geq 0,\,k \in [1,2,...]&lt;/math&gt;

====Summary statistics====
The mean of a chi-squared is &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;

The variance of a chi-squared is &lt;math&gt;2k&lt;/math&gt;

For the proof of these, see the [[Statistics/Distributions/Gamma|gamma distribution]].

Student t-distribution (or just t-distribution for short) is derived from the chi-square and normal distributions. We divide the standard normally distributed value of one variable over the root of a chi-square value over its ''r'' degrees of freedom. Mathematically, this appears as:

&lt;math&gt;
t = \frac{\mbox{Z}}{ \sqrt{ \chi_{r}^2 /r }}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; Z = \frac{X - \bar{X}}{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \chi_{r}^2 = \chi_{r_1}^2 + ... + \chi_{r_n}^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* If you're a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be an idea if you add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:19, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== Page naming ==

Hi - could you look at how you are dealing with naming (the links above will help). I'm guessing [[Data]] is actually a sub page of something (Statistics?) but as such it should be named Statistics/Data.  There is no needs to loose any edits - just use the &quot;move&quot; tab to rename the page.  Ask if you need help - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 16:38, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

You have created a number of pages which I believe are part of the same book.  If they are all part of the same book then you should name them as &quot;BOOKNAME/PAGENAME&quot; rather than &quot;PAGENAME&quot;.  You can easily do this by using the &quot;MOVE&quot; button at the top of the screen (near the &quot;EDIT&quot; button).  [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

:Again could I ask you to look at naming.  I believe [[Sample Points, Sample Space and Events]] possibly should be named [[Economics/Sample Points, Sample Space and Events]] or [[Economic Theory/Sample Points, Sample Space and Events]]? --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

Again could I ask you to look at the naming here - this page needs to be part of a book and should be so named - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:10, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

== Naming policy ==

You appear to continue to ignore messages about naming policy.  Wikibooks is not the same as Wikipedia where stand alone pages are the norm.  Wikibooks is structured to provide text books for people to read with pages gathered below an appropriate title for the &quot;book&quot; as a whole.  Details on this information can be found in the links provided in the welcome above.

I have now moved a number of the pages that you created to a location that appears more appropriate to me.  Please review this and if you feel I have got it wrong request help.  I have also amended some of the redlinks on the [[Econometric Theory]] page to try and show you how they should be done. Please try to ensure that your future contributions follow our policies - thanks --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:12, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

On the Cookbook talk page, [[Talk:Cookbook#Purge 1881 recipes?|it was agreed]] to delete pages from
* the public domain [http://www.publicbookshelf.com/public_html/The_Household_Cyclopedia_of_General_Information/ 1881 Household Cyclopedia]. (tagged by {{tl|1881}}).
* the public domain cookbook [http://www.free-recipes.co.uk/the-cooks-decameron-a-study-in-taste/ The Cook's Decameron: A Study In Taste, Containing Over Two Hundred Recipes For Italian Dishes]. (tagged by {{tl|Decameron}})
* the [http://www.ibiblio.org/oscookbook/ Open Source Cookbook]. (tagged by {{tl|Oscookbook}})
Please read over the discussion at [[Talk:Cookbook#Purge 1881 recipes?]] before commenting. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 19:06, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''. As these pages are available on another site and as the recipes and measurements are dated there is little point in keeping them especially given the discussion that's already taken place on the cookbook talk page. [[User:Xania|Xania]] 19:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''This doesn't belong here as a vote.'''  It is up to cookbook contributors, not the general community, what is wanted inside the cookbook. A cookbook contributor should go through the listed recipes and tag all the ones that have not been appropriately updated or whatever with &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and an administrator should then delete them. '''Some''' of these recipes are probably still wanted as they have been modified and improved by previous cookbook contributors, but most of them aren't worth the effort. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 08:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Close''' per Kellen's notes. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 17:58, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Keep/Delete''' case-by-case. Seems to me that some of them might be good recipes, though of course they'd need to be updated. As Kellen points out, these are chapters of a large book with lots of contributors, and should be discussed internally. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:50, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

*  Hum - suggestion to close?  Over the next few days I'll review each recipe individually.  Where they look reasonably worked up pages fine - the others I will qr-em.  In practice this will allow a couple of weeks over Xmas (unless any of us have a bad time and want to take it out of something!) before they actually get deleted.  Anyone against say so please --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:30, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

: Yes, close this VFD and let it be dealt with internal to the cookbook. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:10, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Wikibooks is not a repository of source texts, and that's what this book is providing. All the links are red even after a month or more of work, and I think we need to stop this now before wasted effort goes into it. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

* '''Keep book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The WikiText Development Process in ECI301 at Old Dominion University'''
Darden College of Education, Fall 2006/Spring 2007/Summer 2007/Fall 2007

This WikiText, The Social and Cultural Foundations of Education, is the combined effort of a dedicated group of professional collaborators, faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students.  The course was planned over the summer of 2006 by Dr. Patrick O’Shea, Adjunct Faculty Member, who had the original idea for a WikiText, Dwight W. Allen, Eminent Scholar of Educational Reform, Peter Baker, Coordinating Graduate Assistant for ECI301 where the WikiText has been developed and used, and Douglas Allen, Associate Professor of Human Resources Development at the University of Denver.  

In the fall they were joined by two other senior researchers, Kevin DePew, Assistant Professor of English, and Danny Curry-Corcoran, Director of Evaluation for the Newport News Public Schools. 

The senior research team also offered an applied research course in the fall semester, paralleling the development of the WikiText.  The major objective of this course was to plan a series of research initiatives to study the outcomes of this unprecedented, innovative approach to the introduction of students to the profession of teaching.  Preparation of the WikiText and the evaluation of learning associated with that text comprised about one half of the total introductory course which also includes traditional lectures, both online and in a face to face format.  The course materials and syllabus can be found at: http://www.odu.edu/educ/dwallen/classallen.htm. 

Though the idea of WikiTexts is new, others have developed texts with the cooperation of students, often though not always graduate students.  (See, for example, the developing [http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wikis student-written text about educational psychology], as well as the online Wikibooks version called [[Contemporary Educational Psychology|''Contemporary Educational Psychology'']]). We decided to take a very different approach taking advantage of the large numbers of students enrolled (about 225) in this introductory class.  First of all students were asked to produce a relatively brief (1,000 words) and very narrowly focused article on one of about 75 topics selected by the professional staff as representing a “typical” mix of topics for comparable courses.   With about 225 students in the class, we created a “sign up page” in the WikiText which allowed as many as three students to sign up for each topic.  In most cases we had two or three student-authored versions of each article.

It was not expected that they would “cover” the topic, but rather would select two to five major concepts they felt would be of value to them as teachers in training.  Students were also required to write five multiple choice questions, applying the concepts their article to real life situations, and one essay question.  In addition they were asked to find a “sidebar” something that would make the article more interesting – a quote, a video clip, an illustration or cartoon, a chart or graph.  

The “book” was written during the first four weeks of class, and the balance of the semester was spent reading the text they had written.  Each student was assigned to read and rate only one version of each article, about ten topics each week.  Typically we received about 50 ratings of each article.  The highest rated article by students was selected as the “official text.”   The other articles, some of which were also highly rated are shown as supplementary materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Religion is born as a result of major superhuman enlightenment or observation of occurance of superhuman event by the masses.
Only when the masses of people observe such event with their mortal senses then people would truely believe in the existence of the power and knowledge beyond their mortal existences and understand and believe those close to the immortals/with superhuman abilities.

Only under such circumstances, the mass of people will believe and follow the teachings of any new religion.

However, over time, the superhuman events may be forgotten or the newer generations begin to doubt and question such occurances. Thus books were written by our ancestors to remind the future generation of such events and teaching.

In the 21st century, only when events are observed by the mass of people in real life and not on internet, not on TV, not on radio will then a new universal religion be born. (Man has learned the skill of altering the airwave, microwave, radiowave, electromagnetic wave to shape the perception of events to their advantage, but man has not mastered the abilities to change the belief and morality for generations to come)

We are a long way from creating a new religion as we currently cannot fully understand the existing religions, and sincerely practice its teachings.

Too many interpretation of simple truth to suit one's unique circumstances thus result in sacrificing others' circumstances. The inability to even map out one's current cause and future effect does not make creating a new path easy.

The people of the 21st century need to understand and practice the core meaning of any chosen religion of their preference and they will understand that all religions are the same.

All doors open to the same path. Yet, few have the ability to open the right door so that they can walk on the right path. 
Worst, some may open the wrong door and tread the wrong path by choosing the non-core.


Till the day that we have learned the ability to live on another planet, we have only one Earth to share with all other living organisms. 
Hence human should treat this one planet well and human will live long enough to find another planet so as to leave this earth for other organisms to evolve peacefully and assist them a little when situation warrants.

The previous beings that live on this Earth has done so eons ago, and now is the time for human to repeat this same task for years to come.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Klaverjas''' is a trick-taking card game of unknown origin, possibly Dutch.

The game is easy to learn and very addictive, but offers a considerable level of complexity and depth. The game is played in many different ways, but the core rules are basically the same.

==Playing the game==

Start with a deck of 32 cards (2,3,4,5,6 and jokers) of each suit removed.

The game generally involves 4 players, two teams of 2, with players in the same team opposite each other. The game involves the selection of trumps and the accumulation of points, generally 1001 points per set.

Each player is consecutively dealt 3, 3 and 2 cards (8 cards per player), the last card being kept separate from the dealers hand. Players pick up their cards and sort them into the various suits, players do not show their hands to any other player. The dealer can look at the separated card to fully assess the hand, but is careful not to show that card to anyone.

Once all players have assessed their hand and are ready to play, the dealer turns over the separated card and the player to the left of the dealer is then required to either nominate the suit of the turned up card as TRUMPS (&quot;take on&quot;) or passes (&quot;pass&quot;), if passed the next player to the left does the same, and so on until the dealer. On the first round , only the suit of the turned up card can be nominated. The first round is performed as quickly as possible so as to ensure that players are not able to alert their playing parter to any particular strength in the hand. IF the dealer passes, the player to the left of the dealer then has a second opportunity to &quot;take on&quot; in any suit other than the original turned up suit. If passed the next player to the left does the same and so on until the dealer. If all players pass twice, then the player to the left of the dealer is required to take on and may revert to any of the suits. In addition to &quot;take on&quot; in a suit, a player may in the second round nominate &quot;no trumps&quot;.

In taking on a suit, a player needs to be reasonable sure of the strength in the hand and the ability of the team to collect sufficient points to beat the other team. If a player takes on and does not collect more points than the other team then the other team is awarded all the points for the hand, this is known as &quot;Bait&quot;.

Once Trumps or No Trumps has been selected, the player to the left of the dealer, selects and plays the first card, each of the 3 remaining player consecutively play their cards (&quot;A trick&quot;) 

===Rules===
#All players are required to play a card in the suit of the first card played in the trick &quot;suit called for&quot;.
#If a player does not have the suit that is called for then the player is required to play a trump card.
#If Trumps is called for then each consecutive player is required to play a higher trump card &quot;over trump&quot;. If the player cannot over trump, then any trump card can be played. This is a strategy used by a team to try and capture the Minel or a high trump card. E.G. Player 1 plays an Ace of trumps, Player 2 is required to over trump with the Minel and player 3 (player 1 teammate) over trumps with the JAS. Player 4 cannot over trump and thus would play a low trump worth no points.
#Card Strength: trumps is stronger than any other suit, so any trump card will always beat any card of another suit. The relative strength of cards is as follows :
#*Trumps
#**Jack (&quot;JAS&quot;) &amp;ndash; worth 20 extra points - points belong to the team that takes the trick.
#**9 &amp;ndash; (&quot;Minel&quot;) worth 14 extra points - points belong to the team that takes the trick. 
#**Ace &amp;ndash; face value 11 points 
#**10 &amp;ndash; face value 10 points
#**K &amp;ndash; face value 4 points
#**Q &amp;ndash; face value 3 points
#**8 &amp;ndash; no value
#**7 &amp;ndash; no value
#*Other suits &amp; no trumps
#**Ace &amp;ndash; 11 points
#**10 &amp;ndash; 10 points
#**K &amp;ndash; 4 Points
#**Q &amp;ndash; 3 points
#**J &amp;ndash; 2 points
#**9 &amp;ndash; 0 points
#**8 &amp;ndash; 0 points
#**7 &amp;ndash; 0 points
#*Other combinations worth extra points :
#**Player with 3 consecutive cards in the same suit - &quot;A 20&quot;  worth 20 extra points
#**Player with 4 consecutive cards in the same suit - &quot;A 50&quot;   worth 50 extra points
#**Player with K &amp; Q of Trumps &quot;Bella&quot; worth 20 extra points.
#**Team which takes the last trick in the hand &quot;Stoch&quot;  - worth 10 extra points.

; Notes
* In Spanish, if an activity is a game, then you &quot;play&quot; it (''jugar''), otherwise you &quot;practice&quot; it (''practicar''). For example, it's ''jugar al tenis'' (&quot;to play tennis&quot;) but ''practicar la natación'' (&quot;to go swimming&quot;).
* If someone plays an instrument you use the verb ''tocar''. For example, ''tocar la guitarra'' (&quot;to play the guitar&quot;) 
* The verbs are all regular, except:
** ''Jugar'' (this is discussed in detail below)
** ''Ver'' (v'''eo''', ves, ve, vemos, v'''eis''', ven)

; Examples
* ''Veo mucho la tele.''
*: I watch TV a lot
* ''Practico natación.''
*: I go swimming.
* ''¿Practicas judo?''
*: Do you do judo?
* ''Practicamos muchas actividades.''
*: We do many activites
* ''¿Por qué cantáis?''
*: Why do you sing?
* ''¿Cuándo lee?''
*: When does he or she read?

== Stem-changing Verbs ==
''Jugar'' the first type of irregular verb; known as a '''stem-changing verb'''. Basically, in the &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he/she/it&quot; and &quot;they&quot; forms, the ''u'' or ''o'' changes to a ''ue''. The ''jugar'' example is written out below.

{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Verb|Jugar|To play|2}}

|-
| I
| J'''ue'''go
|-
| You
| J'''ue'''gas
|-
| He/She/It
| J'''ue'''ga
|-
| We
| Jugamos
|-
| You all
| Jugáis
|-
| They
| J'''ue'''gan
|}

; Other verbs that follow this pattern
* ''poder'' (&quot;to be able to&quot;): puedo, puedes, puede, podemos, podéis, pueden
* ''dormir'' (&quot;to sleep&quot;): duermo, duermes, duerme, dormimos, dormís, duermen
* ''encontrar'' (&quot;to find&quot;): encuentro, encuentras, encuentra, encontramos, encontráis, encuentran

; Notes
* The verb ''jugar'' always has ''a'' after it: ''jugar a''. In Spanish, ''a el'' gets contracted to ''al'' and ''de el'' gets contracted to ''del''. So, it would be ''juego al rugby''.
* ''Poder'' (meaning &quot;to be able to&quot;) is usually followed by another verb, making &quot;I can do something&quot;. The following verb must be in the infinitive. For example, ''puede leer'' (&quot;he can read&quot;).

; Examples
* ''Juego al tenis.''
*: I play tennis.
* ''¿Jugáis al ajedrez?''
*: Do you play chess?
* ''¿Qué deportes juegas?''
*: What sports do you play?
* ''¿Cuándo juegan al fútbol?''

== Compound Sentences ==
So far, everything we've written has been simple sentences &amp;mdash; &quot;My name is Santiago&quot; (''Me llamo Santiago''); &quot;The city is noisy&quot; (''La ciudad es ruidosa''); &quot;I play american football&quot; (''Juego al fútbol americano''). Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could join them up? Below are some little words that will make our sentences longer, and more meaningful. You use them just like you do in English.

Also, everything we've written has been positive (&quot;I do this, I do that&quot;). To make it negative, we just add a word in front of the verb: ''no'' (meaning &quot;not&quot;) or ''nunca'' (meaning &quot;never&quot;). For example, ''No juego al rugby'' (I don't play rugby&quot;); ''Nunca como manzanas'' (&quot;I never eat apples&quot;). It's as simple as that.

; Note
* ''Porque'' (&quot;because&quot;) and ''Por qué'' (&quot;why&quot;) are similar and easy to mix up; make sure you don't!

; Examples
* ''Me llamo Chris y mi cumpleaños es el veinte de agosto.''
*: My name is Chris and my birthday is on the 20th of August.
* ''Me llamo Raúl, pero él se llama Roberto.''
*: My name is Raúl, but his name is Robert.
* ''No practica judo.''

*: I play american football and I go swimming too.
* ''No vivo en una ciudad porque las ciudades son ruidosas.''
*: I don't live in the city because cities are noisy.

== ¿Qué opinas sobre los deportes? ==
	  	
To ask someone about their opinions in Spanish, use ''Qué opinas sobre'' (&quot;What is your opinion about&quot;) then the thing you want their opinion on (''¿Que opinas sobre los deportes?'' means &quot;What do you think about sports?&quot;).
	  		  	
=== Gustar ===
	  	
There is no verb for &quot;to like&quot; in Spanish. Instead, you use ''gusta'' (meaning &quot;it pleases&quot;) and a personal pronoun; you say that &quot;it pleases me&quot; or &quot;I am pleased by it&quot;. The personal pronouns are shown below.

; Notes
	  	
* Like any other verb, you can put ''no'' in front of it, to say &quot;I don't like&quot; (''No me gusta'').
	  	
* If you like an activity rather than a thing, just use the infinitive afterwards: &quot;I like swimming&quot; (''Me gusta nadar'').
	  	
* ''Gusta'' means &quot;it pleases&quot;, so only works for singular things. If the thing that you like is plural (the women for example), you add &quot;n&quot; (''Me gustan las mujeres'' - &quot;I like women&quot;).

=== Love and Hate ===
	  	
Just saying you like or dislike something is a bit dull. Saying you love something is really easy. Instead of ''gusta'', use ''encanta'' (''Me encanta leer'' means &quot;I love reading&quot;). To say you hate something, use the regular verb ''Odiar'' (odio, odias, odia, odiamos, odiáis, odian).
	  		  	
You can also use ''nada'' or ''mucho'' to add emphasis to ''gusta''. For example, ''No me gusta nada ver la tele'' (&quot;I don't like watching TV at all&quot;); ''Me gusta mucho el ajedrez'' (&quot;I like chess a lot&quot;).
	  		  	
; Examples
	  	
* ''¿Qué opinas sobre el ajedrez?''
*: What do you think of chess?
	  	
* ''Me gusta el críquet.''
*: I like cricket.
	  	
* ''No le gustan los deportes.''
*: He doesn't like sports.
	  	
* ''Nos gusta jugar al rugby y fútbol.''
*: We like playing rugby and football.
	  	
* ''Les gusta mucho nadar, pero no pueden cantar.''
*: They like swimming a lot but they can't sing.
	  	
* ''¿Te gusta practicar la natación?''
*: Do you like going swimming?
	  	
* ''¿Por qué os gusta el tenis?''  	
*: Why do (all of) you like tennis? 
	  	
* ''Odian el ajedrez.''	
*: They hate chess.
	  	
* ''Me encantan los deportes, así vivo en la ciudad.''
*: I love sports, so I live in the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The food pyramid guide is updated and published by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The 2005 version is shown here:

[[image:MyPyramid1.png |600px|thumb|left|2005 Version of the USDA Food Pyramid]]
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

With the updated version, the USDA did away with &quot;number of servings&quot; criteria, and replaced it with a web-based tool that features individualized plans and statistics.  The tool can be found at [http://mypyramidtracker.gov mypyramidtracker.gov].  This tool also allows a person to enter a daily food diary, analyze nutrient intake, and can compare an individual's diet with the food pyramid recommendations.  Other improvements to the pyramid include the replacement of &quot;serving size&quot; with the more objective &quot;cups.&quot;

Following the food pyramid helps ensure that a person gets a balanced and varied diet.
To know the recommendations for a particular individual using the current version of the USDA food pyramid, you must first go to [http://mypyramid.gov MyPyramid.gov] and enter the Pathfinder's profile (age, sex, and physical activity).  This will tell you how much of each food category the Pathfinder should eat.

The values in the table below are for children who are physically active for 60 minutes or more per day.  Use the USDA website for adults and for less active children.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section provides that, except where expressly provided elsewhere in the Taxes Acts, the profits of a [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 15 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Schedule A]] business are computed in the same way as the profits of a trade are computed for the purposes of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 18 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Case I of Schedule D]].

The following sections therefore apply to the calculation of profits under Schedule A in the same way as they apply to the calculation of profits under Schedule D:

The following provisions apply in accordance with subsection (1)-

*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 87 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 72]] (apportionment); 
*the provisions of Chapter V of Part IV (computational provisions relating to the Schedule D charge), except as mentioned below; 
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 577 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 577]] (business entertainment expenses); 
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 577A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 577A]] (expenditure involving crime); 
*Sections [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 579 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|579]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 580 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|580]] (redundancy payments); 
*Section [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 588 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|588]] (training courses for employees); 
*Section [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 589A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|589A]] (counselling services for employees); 
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 73 of the Finance Act 1988|Section 73(2)]] of the Finance Act 1988 (consideration for restrictive undertakings); 
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 43 of the Finance Act 1989|Section 43]] of the Finance Act 1989 (deductions in respect of certain emoluments); 
*Sections [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 42 of the Finance Act 1998|42]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 46 of the Finance Act 1998|46(1) and (2)]] of the Finance Act 1998 (provisions as to computation of profits and losses).
*Sections [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 196 of the Finance Act 2004||196]], [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 196A of the Finance Act 2004|196A]], [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 197 of the Finance Act 2004|197]],  [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 198 of the Finance Act 2004|198]], [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 199 of the Finance Act 2004|199]] and [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 200 of the Finance Act 2004|200]] of the Finance Act 2004 (registered pension schemes); 
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 246 of the Finance Act 2004|Section 246]] of the Finance Act 2004 (employer-financed retirement benefits schemes).

[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 74 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 74(1)(d) ICTA]] (disallowance of provisions for future repairs) applies in relation to a Schedule A business as if the reference to premises occupied for the purposes of the trade were to premises held for the purposes of the Schedule A business.

The following provisions that do apply for Schedule D purposes do not, however, apply for Schedule A:

*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 87 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 87]] (treatment of premiums taxed as rent), and 
*[[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Section 98 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988|Section 98]] (tied premises: receipts and expenses treated as those of trade).

Part 1 of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom/Legislation/Schedule 22 to the Finance Act 2001|Schedule 22 to the Finance Act 2001]] (deduction for capital expenditure on remediation of contaminated land) applies in accordance with subsection (1), and the other Parts of that Schedule (further provision as to relief for remediation of contaminated land) have effect in relation to a Schedule A business in accordance with their provisions.
