==Introduction==
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening medical emergency because of rapid constriction of the airway, often within minutes of exposure to the allergen.  It is commonly triggered by insect stings and foods such as shellfish or peanuts.  Call for help immediately.  First aid for anaphylaxis consists of obtaining advanced medical care at once. Look to see if a device such as an Epi-pen is available - most people who know they have anaphylactic reactions will carry an Epi-pen with them. First aiders in many jurisdictions are now permitted to administer epinephrine in the form of an Epi-pen if the victim is unable to do so themselves. ''Check what the law says in your area.''

==Recognition==
*Hives or rash all over accompanied by itchiness
*Swelling or puffiness of the lymph nodes, especially around the neck and mouth
*Swelling of the airway and tongue
*Difficulty breathing, wheezing or gasping

==Treatment==
*'''Call EMS''' immediately
*Have the victim administer their Epi-pen if possible
*If available, administer an antihistamine to decrease swelling
*Encourage the victim to breathe slowly; calm them
*The victim should rest until EMS arrives
*Monitor ABCs and begin CPR if required
*If the victim is unable to administer their Epi-pen and it is legal to do so, administer the Epi-pen for them

===Administering an EpiPen===
{{FA Regional Note|Administering an EpiPen is not legal in all jurisdictions without proper training and certification.}}
EpiPens are the most common form of epinephrine auto-injectors, and are designed for ease of use. There are instructions in the tube with the auto-injector, but you should know how to use one ahead of time. They're designed to inject through clothes, so you don't have to remove the victim's pants - even if they're wearing a heavy material like denim. Whenever possible, the victim should inject themselves, but if they're unable to do so, you ''may'' be legally permitted to inject the victim.

Remove the auto-injector from the tube. One end has a black tip - this is where the needle will come out. '''Do not touch this tip!''' The other end has a grey cap. Remove the grey cap, hold the EpiPen in your fist, and press it firmly against the outside of the victim's outer thigh. There should be an audible click. If there is not, try again but pressing harder. '''Hold the auto-injector in place for 10 seconds.''' When you remove it, massage the area for 10 seconds, then replace the EpiPen into the tube ''needle end first'' to avoid any danger. When EMS arrives, they can dispose of it for you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FirstAidHeader}}

A burn is the exposure of tissue to [[#Thermal burns|heat (thermal burns)]], [[#Chemical burns|chemicals (wet or dry)]], by [[#Electrical burns|electricity]], or by [[#Radiation burns|radiation]].


==Recognition==
[[Image:Blister.jpg|thumb|A second-degree thermal burn - notice the blister centre of the burn, and the surrounding redness.]]
[[Image:8-day-old-3rd-degree-burn.jpg|thumb|A third-degree burn - note severe tissue destruction.]]
There are 3 degrees of burns:
# ''Superficial Burn - First-degree'' Skin will be dry, red, may swell and will usually be painful. An ordinary sunburn is a common example.
# ''Partial thickness - Second-degree'' Skin will be red and may swell, usually very painful, has blisters that may open and release a clear fluid. This will make the skin appear wet.
# ''Full Thickness - Third-degree'' May destroy underlying tissues such as fat, bones, nerves, and muscles. Skin may be brown or black and will look charred. Tissue underneath may appear white. May be very painful or painless due to nerve endings being destroyed.

==Treatment==
===Thermal burns===
You must stop the burning by removing the person from the source of the burn, being careful not to endanger yourself. Check for any life-threatening conditions by checking the '''A'''irway, '''B'''reathing, and '''C'''irculation. Cool the burn with copious amounts of pure water until the pain is relieved (in case of dry chemical burns, brush off residue first).

After the victim feels some relief, cover the burn loosely with a sterile, dry (preferably non-adhesive) dressing. '''Do not use butter, oils, creams, etc.'''; they can trap heat and increase risk of infection. They will also need to be cleaned out by the hospital later, which only increases the pain the patient must endure.  Also do not use antiseptics that may aggravate sensitive skin. '''Treat for shock.''' Burns cripple the body's ability to regulate heat. Ensure the person does not become over-heated or chilled.

Aloe vera extract, silverdene (Silver Sulfazdiazine), topical analgaesics, and NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen or aspirin) are commonly used medications.  Consult a doctor before use.

===Chemical burns===
{{FA X|
*Apply ice or iced water except on small first degree burns.
*Touch a burn with anything other than a sterile covering.
*Remove adhered clothing.
*Try to clean a severe burn.
*Break blisters.
*Use any kind of ointment on a severe burn.
}}
If there is a dry chemical, brush it off the skin using paper, cloth, or with a gloved hand. Be sure not to get any on yourself or more on the patient. Once the bulk of the dry chemical is gone, flush with running water as above. Call EMS immediately.
If the burn is caused by a wet chemical, flush with plenty of water for 15 minutes and while flushing, call EMS immediately.

===Electrical burns===
Electrical burns look like third-degree burns, but are not surrounded by first- and second-degree burns. They always come in pairs: an entry wound (smallest) and exit wound (larger). Call EMS immediately if a person has been shocked as electrocution can cause cardiac and respiratory problems. Be prepared to give CPR or defibrillation. Care is the same for thermal burns.

===Radiation burns===
Radiation burns, though typically caused from a nuclear source, could also include ultraviolet radiation in the form of sunburn which should be treated as a thermal burn.  Burns caused by a nuclear source, though rare, are still possible.  Radiation burns can not be treated by a lay rescuer.  Individuals working in high-risk environments for possible radiation exposure are trained in the treatment of radiation burns.  The rescuer may unknowingly put himself/herself at risk of radiation exposure by treating someone with a radiation burn.  For all nuclear radiation burns, call your local emergency number immediately.

Radiation burns also come in the form of snow blindness (or other intense light burns to the retina). Cover the eyes with sterile gauze, and contact EMS immediately. Do whatever you can to keep the victim comfortable, monitor ABCs, treat for shock, and keep the victim calm.

===Critical Burns===
The following burns require medical attention as soon as possible. They may be life-threatening, disabling, and disfiguring. Call the local emergency number if:

*The burns are to a child younger than five years old or to an elderly person.
*The patient is having difficulty breathing.
*The burns are on more than one body part.
*There are burns to the head, neck, hands, feet, or genitals.
*There are burns to the mouth or nose (these may be signs of burns to the airway).
*The burns result from chemicals or electricity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FirstAidHeader}}

==Immobilization==
The proper method of slinging depends on where the injury occurred on the arm. After applying a sling, ensure circulation to the arm has not been compromised by doing a distal circulation check. Remember also that moving an arm into a position where you can put a sling on it may be painful for the victim. If that is the case, simply immobilize in the position found. You will have to improvise something based on the victim’s position of comfort.

===The arm sling – for injuries to the forearm===
[[Image:Forearm splint.jpg|thumb|A splint and sling applied to the forearm. Note the second triangular bandage immobilizing the arm by holding it against the torso.]]
*Support the injured forearm approximately parallel to the ground with the wrist slightly higher than the elbow.
*Place an open triangular bandage between the body and the arm, with its apex towards the elbow.
*Extend the upper point of the bandage over the shoulder on the uninjured side.
*Bring the lower point up over the arm, across the shoulder on the injured side to join the upper point and tie firmly with a reef knot.
*Ensure the elbow is secure by folding the excess bandage over the elbow, securing it with a safety pin.

This can be accomplished by using the victim’s shirt or sweater as a sling. Simply pin the bottom hem to their chest using multiple safety pins, going over the arm. This works surprisingly well!

===Elevated sling – for injuries to the shoulder===

*Support the victim’s arm with the elbow beside the body and the hand extended towards the uninjured shoulder.
*Place an opened triangular bandage over the forearm and hand, with the apex towards the elbow.
*Extend the upper point of the bandage over the uninjured shoulder.
*Tuck the lower part of the bandage under the injured arm, bring it under the elbow and around the back and extend the lower point up to meet the upper point at the shoulder.
*Tie firmly with a reef knot.
*Secure the elbow by folding the excess material and applying a safety pin, and then ensure that the sling is tucked under the arm giving firm support.

===Collar and cuff – for upper arm or rib injuries===

*Allow the elbow to hang naturally at the side and place the hand extended towards the shoulder on the uninjured side.
*Form a clove hitch by forming two loops – one towards you, the other away.
*Put the loops together by sliding your hands under the loops and closing with a “clapping” motion. If you can tie a clove hitch, simply tie it on the wrist.
*Slide the clove hitch over the hand and gently pull it firmly to secure the wrist. Extend the points of the bandage to either side of the neck, and tie firmly with a reef knot.
*Allow the arm to hang naturally.
*''It is especially important for this sling that you ensure that circulation to the hand is not compromised – do distal circulation checks often.''

===Femoral fractures===
The femur is the largest bone in the body, and has a large artery, the femoral artery, directly beside it. Because a mechanism of injury which can fracture the femur is likely to also displace the fracture, it is possible that the femoral artery will be damaged internally. Damage to the femoral artery is likely to cause massive internal bleeding, so it is a major emergency; '''Call EMS''' immediately. Be sure to maintain as much immobilization as possible and monitor ABCs until EMS arrives.

==Sprain or Fracture?==
[[File:Communitive midshaft humeral fracture callus.jpg|thumb|Communitive midshaft humeral fracture: a compound fracture of the left upper arm.]]
Sprains, strains, dislocations, and fractures can all present with the same symptoms. It is very difficult to determine what the injury may be. It is not necessary to know which injury the victim has as the treatment will be the same for all of them.
Sprains only occur when a ligament is stretched past its normal limits.
Strains occur when a muscle or tendon is stretched past its normal limits.
Dislocations are when a bone comes out of its normal joint.
Fractures are actual breaks in the bone.

When assessing an injury, the history will inform the practitioner almost as good as anything.  The anatomy, the way it feels, hearing a &quot;pop,&quot; loss of function, and what the pain feels like are good indicators to having a musculoskeletal injury.
If the patient has any of the following symptoms, you should treat for a possible muscle or skeletal injury.
*Deformity at the injury site
*Crepitus - A grinding or cracking sound when the affected area is moved (usually accompanied by extreme pain). ('''Do not test for this!''' It should be reported by the patient.)
*Bruising and swelling
*No pulse below injury site
*Inability to use the affected body part normally

''If the injury appears to be severe, EMS should be activated as soon as possible.  These injuries include open fractures, shoulder/hip dislocations, and any injury that compromises nerve or circulatory function.''

==Treatment==
The  acute treatment for muscle, bone or joint injury can follow the simple acronym &quot;'''RICE'''&quot;.

:'''R'''est - Rest is very important for soft tissue injuries, both in the short term and for longer term care.
:'''I'''mmobilize - Sprains, strains and dislocations can be slinged; fractures should be [[First Aid/Fractures|splinted]] and slinged.
:'''C'''old - Ice should be applied periodically, for around 10-20 minutes at a time.  After the 10-20 minutes, you need at least a 20 minute off period before you ice again.  Any person sensitive to cold should have a layer of clothing between the skin and the ice.  
:'''E'''levation - Where appropriate, the injury should be elevated above the heart, as this may help reduce the localized swelling which occurs. Do not elevate if this causes more pain to the victim.

If the injury is bad enough, the victim should be referred to a physician.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FirstAidHeader}}
==Introduction==
The spinal cord is a thick nerve that runs down the neck and back; it is protected by bones called vertebrae. If the spinal cord is injured, this can lead to paralysis. Since the vertebrae protect the spinal cord, it is generally difficult to cause such an injury. Note that only an x-ray can conclusively determine if a spinal injury exists. If a spinal injury is suspected, the victim '''must''' be treated as though one does exist.

==Recognition==
*Mental confusion (such as paranoia or euphoria)
*Dizziness
*Head, neck or back pain
*Paralysis
*Any fall where the head or neck has fallen more than two metres (just over head height on an average male)
*Cerebrospinal fluid in the nose or ears
*Resistance to moving the head
*Pupils which are not equal and reactive to light
*Head or back injury
*Priapism

==Treatment==
{{FA Best Practice|'''Life over limb:''' Immobilize the spine as best as you can, but Airway, Breathing and Circulation take priority.}}
The victim should not be moved unless absolutely necessary. Without moving the victim, check if the victim is breathing. If they are not, CPR must be initiated; the victim must be rolled while attempting to minimize movement of the spine. If the victim is breathing, immobilize their spine in the position found.
The easiest way to immobilize the spine in the position found is sandbagging. Despite the name, it doesn't necessarily require bags of sand. Simply pack towels, clothing, bags of sand etc. around the victim's head such that it is immobilized. Be sure to leave their face accessible, since you'll need to monitor their breathing.

If you must roll the victim over to begin CPR, take great care to keep their spine immobilized. You may want to recruit bystanders to help you. Hands-on training is the only way to learn the various techniques which are appropriate for use in this situation.

===Aquatic Spinal Injury Management===
Many spinal injuries are the result of a dive into shallow water. Lifeguards and lifesavers receive specialized training to manage spinal injuries in the water. Such hands-on training is the only way to learn the various techniques which are appropriate for use in such situations. If you see a victim in the water and did not witness what happened to the victim or are unsure if the victim has a spinal injury, immediately get the attention of a lifeguard or other trained responder.

      <comment>/* Frostbite */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ FirstAidHeader}}

==Frostbite==

Frostbite is when tissues freeze. If the frozen tissue is more than skin deep, this is considered ''deep'' frostbite.

Treatment for frostbite is as follows:

*Notify EMS as soon as possible or be prepared to transport victim to a medical facility, even after treatment of frostbite.
*Make sure there is no risk of re-freezing. Skin that re-freezes after thawing will have more damage.
*Remove victim from cold environment, ensure there is no possibility of hypothermia. (If there is, see below.)
*Fill a shallow container with enough water to cover the frostbitten body part. Make sure the water is at room temperature. The water does not have to be cool, but it cannot be too warm. The warmer the water, the worse the pain.
*Immerse the injured area, ensure that the skin does not come into contact with anything but the water!
*Repeat the above step by refreshing the water as it cools until the skin is back to a normal color and texture. This may take several hours depending on the severity of the injury.

Remember to transport the victim to a medical assistance for further assessment after the above steps.

==Hypothermia==
Hypothermia is when the body's core temperature drops so low the body can no longer warm itself back up. Severe hypothermia is classified as when the body drops below 95 degrees Fahrenheit.

Treatment for victims of hypothermia is as follows:
{{FA X|'''Never''' jostle a victim of extreme hypothermia as this may cause cardiac arrest!}}
*Remove the victim from the cold environment.
*For cases of extreme hypothermia, where the patient is showing signs of confusion, slurred speech, fumbling hands, or go unconscious, notify EMS.
*Remove wet clothing from the victim and replace with dry clothing. (A dry hat is recommended to be worn.)
*Wrap victim in blankets.
*Use heat packs to warm the patient. Do not allow the packs to touch naked skin.
*Victims who are alert may drink warm liquids, however, do '''not''' give any drinks containing alcohol, caffeine, or give a drink that is too hot. 

Warning: Victims of hypothermia may become worse as they warm, this is due to cold blood moving towards the core of the body. If a patient goes unconscious, check their ABCs and notify EMS.

''&quot;Nobody's dead until they're warm and dead&quot;'' First aid procedures must therefore continue until professional help is available.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ FirstAidHeader}}

==Introduction==

Specific information concerning treatment can be obtained from accompanying labels or written documentation such as the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet). Expert advice (poison control) and rapid transport to advanced medical care (EMS) is urgently needed in poisoning cases.

A poisoning victim may require [[First Aid/CPR summary|basic life support]] at any moment; monitor the victim's ABCs throughout.

==Absorbed Poisons==
===Background===
Absorbed poisons are taken into the body through unbroken skin.  Absorbed poisons are especially dangerous as they may not only cause local damage, but they can enter the bloodstream and cause widespread damage. It is important to note that certain poisons such as agricultural chemicals or insecticides may enter the bloodstream through absorption while leaving the skin undamaged.

===Treatment===
As with any type of poisoning, EMS should be immediately called and the rescuer should always start with the initial assessment and treat any life-threatening problems before continuing.  Once all life-threats are taken care of, then the poison should be removed carefully. Failure to do so may lead to the rescuer succumbing to the poison as well. Rescuers should always wear at least one and possibly two sets of gloves. Filter masks should also be worn to prevent inhalation. 

Topical poisons tend to be in either a powder or liquid form. The treatment for either form is the same. First, remove any excess poison from the affected area, being careful not to inhale or touch it. This will decrease the potential for harm and make the next step exponentially easier. If possible, capture the poison in a clean secure container for identification purposes. Next, irrigate the affected area for at least 20 minutes to dilute the poison.

==Inhaled Poisons==
Inhalation injuries can come from a variety of sources including the inhalation of smoke, gasses, and chemicals.  Get victim to fresh air. Use caution in giving rescue breathing to a person overcome by hazardous chemicals, as you may be contaminated in so doing.

==Ingested Poisons==
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent.  Symptoms, such as vomiting are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.  The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.  Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.

{{FA X|Do not administer emergency antidotes or induce vomiting without the benefit of expert advice.}}Call for help immediately as advanced medical care will be required.   If possible contact a poison control center and provide information about the suspected poison.  Depending on the type of poison, the poison control center may suggest additional first aid measures pending the arrival of emergency medical technicians.  These might include dilution with water or milk, administration of syrup of ipecac or activated charcoal, or the use of other common household products as improvised emergency antidotes.

Appropriate first aid measures vary depending on the type of poison.  Induced vomiting may do more harm than good, because the poison may harm the alimentary canal or esophagus.  Vomit may also block the airway.  However, induced vomiting may be necessary with some poisons to save the victim's life.

==Injected Poisons==

An injection poisoning can occur from a variety of sources. From drug abuse to insect bites/stings to animal bites. Poison Control Centers will provide the best information for first aiders. Basic treatment involves monitoring the patients ABCs, treating for shock, observing the patient for an allergic reaction, and calming the patient.

To help EMS, gain as much information about the poison as you can. What it was, when it was injected, how it was injected, and if the person has any allergies to the injection. (For example a bee sting causing anaphylaxis.)

==What is Critical Incident Stress?==

Any emergency that involves a severe injury or death is a critical incident. This incident could be amplified should the emergency involve a family member or friend. The stress that these incidents cause may overwhelm a first aider and shut down their ability to cope. This is what is known as critical incident stress (CIS). This condition may have a great impact on the first aider suffering from it, and if left un-treated, this stress may lead to a more serious condition known as post-traumatic stress syndrome.

==Signs of CIS==

*May not perform well at their job.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

It is surprising that there is no mention of the difference in pronunciation between the different dialects. I myself do not speak Irish, although I aspire to; however, this is one thing that I do know. Does anyone here have particular expertise in this area? Thanks! ~chainedwind[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chainedwind]

== Pronunciation IPA, etc. ==

To try and help with the IPA, I will first note I have little or no knowledge of Irish Gaelic, but hopefully can shine some light on the pronunciation.

Broad d: [d]
Slender d: [dʒ] (as in ju'''dg'''e)
Broad s: [s] (does this voice to become [z] or similar in any notable case?)
Slender s: [ʃ]
Broad t: [t]
Slender t: [tʃ] (from ha'''tch''')

I will try to find a better source of information &amp; reference in the morning, as these are just assumed from the information on the page. I have not made the edits because of my unfamiliarity with the language &amp; it's phonology/pronunciation. Hope this helps.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Understanding Transformation Matrices ==

The concepts behind building a transformation matrix are easy enough to understand, but what does that matrix
actually represent? This section describes a mechanism of interpreting a composite transformation matrix with multiple translations, rotations, and scalings in terms of transitions between reference frames. It provides a model for organizing primitive transformations into a hierarchical system of nested reference frames.

== The Reference Frame ==

We normally think of objects as moving &quot;forward and backwards&quot;, &quot;up and down&quot;, or &quot;left and right&quot;; we do not
normally consider their motion with respect to an arbitrary reference frame. They &quot;turn around&quot; (yaw), &quot;look up&quot; (pitch), and &quot;cartwheel&quot; (roll), &quot;move forward&quot;, &quot;strafe left&quot;, and &quot;jump up&quot;. So how do we compose transformations to create objects that behave symbolically more like they do in the real world?

Let us define an object's &lt;i&gt;reference frame&lt;/i&gt; as its position and orientation. This can be uniquely defined by two orthogonal vectors specifying the object's &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;up&quot; directions (implying a third, &quot;right&quot; == forward cross up), and a vertex specifying the object's position. 

When the parameters of the child reference frame are specified by vectors/vertices in the parent reference frame's
coordinates, we can create a matrix that transforms a vector &lt;i&gt;from&lt;/i&gt; the child's reference frame &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; the 
parent's reference frame by creating the matrix out of the four column vectors (right, up, forward, position),
where right == forward cross up.

Let us make this more concrete. 

=== The Reference Frame of the Universe, or The Ether Revisited ===

We will first look at the identity matrix:

&lt;math&gt;
frame_{universe} = \left[
\begin{array}{ c c c c }
    1.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.00\\
    0.00 &amp; 1.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.00\\
    0.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 1.00 &amp; 0.00\\
    0.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 1.00
\end{array} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

By our definition, we interpret the first column ({1,0,0,0}) as the &quot;right&quot; direction, the second ({0,1,0,0})
as &quot;up&quot;, the third ({0,0,1,0}) as &quot;forward&quot; (or &quot;backward&quot;, if you prefer), and the fourth ({0,0,0,1}) as the &quot;position&quot; vertex. Note that the position vertex has a w coordinate of 1, whereas the direction vectors (which are really the differences between two vertices) have a w coordinate of 0. 

This example appears trivial, but it provides us with a foundation. We can call this the &quot;universe&quot; reference 
frame. Right is +x, up is +y, forward (or backward, if you prefer) is +z, and the origin is located at {0,0,0,1}.

Now, we can look at the example of a child object within the universe. We can specify this object's reference frame
via the matrix:

&lt;math&gt;
frame_{child} = \left[
\begin{array}{ c c c c }
right_x &amp; up_x &amp; forward_x &amp; position_x\\
right_y &amp; up_y &amp; forward_y &amp; position_y\\
right_z &amp; up_z &amp; forward_z &amp; position_z\\
right_w &amp; up_w &amp; forward_w &amp; position_w
\end{array} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

where right, up, and forward are the frame's normalized direction vectors and position is the frame's position vertex, 
specified in the frame of the parent (or 'universe') object. This is easiest understood when the 'w' coordinate of all directions is 0 and the 'w' coordinate of the position vertex is 1, as per the &quot;fourth-dimensional hack&quot; convention.

To demonstrate: We have vertex v = {2, 0, 0, 1} in the coordinates of frame&lt;sub&gt;child&lt;/sub&gt;. Multiplying frame&lt;sub&gt;child&lt;/sub&gt; by v, we get:

&lt;math&gt;frame_{child} \times \left[ \begin{array}{ c } 2\\ 0\\ 0\\ 1\end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ c } 2 \times right_x + position_x\\ 2 \times right_y + position_y\\ 2 \times right_z + position_z\\ 2 \times right_w + position_w\end{array} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Note that 2*right&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; + position&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 when right&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and position&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = 1. We see that the vertex v in frame&lt;sub&gt;child&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to 2*frame&lt;sub&gt;right&lt;/sub&gt; + frame&lt;sub&gt;position&lt;/sub&gt;, which is precisely the description of v in the parent reference frame. Also note that in the case of a direction-without-position (w=0), the rotations are applied but position is not accumulated - the direction is reoriented without falsely being assigned a position.

Each &quot;frame&quot; matrix is a transformation from the reference frame that the coordinate is specified in to the reference frame of the parent object, so that 
ultimately we have:
  frame&lt;sub&gt;parent&lt;/sub&gt;*frame&lt;sub&gt;child&lt;/sub&gt;*frame&lt;sub&gt;nested_child&lt;/sub&gt;*vertex_in_nested_child_coords ==
  frame&lt;sub&gt;parent&lt;/sub&gt;*frame&lt;sub&gt;child&lt;/sub&gt;*vertex_in_child_coords ==
  frame&lt;sub&gt;parent&lt;/sub&gt;*vertex_in_parent_coords ==
  vertex_in_universe_coords

This matrix (frame&lt;sub&gt;parent&lt;/sub&gt;*frame&lt;sub&gt;child&lt;/sub&gt;*frame&lt;sub&gt;nested_child&lt;/sub&gt;), when post-multiplied to the universe's reference frame matrix, will transform a coordinate from the nested_child's coordinates to the universe's coordinates. These reference frames may be nested indefinitely. 

An example reference frame hierarchy:
  universe -&gt; galaxy -&gt; solar system -&gt; earth -&gt; position on earth
The motions of each reference frame may be considered &quot;independent&quot; of each other. When the galaxy moves, the solar system moves with it, and with that the earth, and with that your position on earth.

=== Scaling Operations ===
While it is this author's opinion that scaling operations should generally be avoided, since they butcher vertex normals,
sometimes they are needed anyway. Fortunately, this is easy to accomplish. Let us consider the scaling transformation:
                | &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;   0  0   0  |
  scale_xform = | 0   &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;  0   0  |
                | 0   0   &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;  0  |
                | 0   0   0   &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; |
where &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; == 1 unless you are insane.

Typically, we will want to scale the vertices as the first operation performed; when we &quot;scale&quot; x by a factor of 3,
we typically do not want to scale its orientation and position (i.e., the columns of the transformation matrix), since they
are specified in the coordinates of the &lt;i&gt;parent&lt;/i&gt; reference frame. As such, scaling is the last operation appended 
to the matrix in the &quot;reference frame&quot; transformation model.

When we multiply frame&lt;sub&gt;child&lt;/sub&gt; by scale_xform, we get:
                | &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;*right&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;*up&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;*forward&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;*position&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; |
  final_xform = | &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;*right&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;*up&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;*forward&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;*position&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; |
                | &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;*right&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;*up&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;*forward&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;*position&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; |
                | &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;*right&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;*up&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;*forward&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;*position&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; |

The scale factors simply show up as the magnitudes of the orientation vectors.

== The &quot;Camera&quot; Transformation ==
FIXME: I have only proven this, and have not demonstrated whether it works.

The transformation from the reference frame of the universe to that of the camera is subtly but critically
different from those described above. Unlike the previous discussion, the 'camera' (&lt;i&gt;parent&lt;/i&gt; reference frame) is typically specified in 'universe' (&lt;i&gt;child&lt;/i&gt; reference frame) coordinates. Using the conventional logic of a camera moving freely through a universe requires extra consideration.

To convert between the universe and camera reference frames, we need to create a set of &quot;fixed&quot; coordinates which represent the 'universe' as a child of the 'camera'; we need the universe's reference frame in camera coordinates.

FIXME: needs illustrations, badly. Thinking out this problem:
# If the camera is facing the same direction as the universe: No transformation.
# If the camera is cocked to the left, then the universe needs to be cocked to the right.
# If the camera is pitched upwards, then the universe needs to be pitched downwards.
# If the camera is facing the opposite direction as the universe, the universe needs to face the other way.
# If the camera is upside-down with respect to the universe, the universe needs to be flipped over.

These are characteristics of reflections; the entire &quot;camera&quot; reference frame matrix is the composition of the column vectors of the reflections of the camera's 'universe' coordinates about the universe's axes. Defining 
  c = camera reference frame in universe coordinates
  u = universe reference frame (identity)
  refl(a, b) = reflection of a over b = 2*dot(a,b)*b - a:
we can build the camera's reference frame matrix as:
  frame&lt;sub&gt;camera&lt;/sub&gt; = { refl(c&lt;sub&gt;right&lt;/sub&gt;, u&lt;sub&gt;right&lt;/sub&gt;), refl(c&lt;sub&gt;up&lt;/sub&gt;, u&lt;sub&gt;up&lt;/sub&gt;), refl(c&lt;sub&gt;forward&lt;/sub&gt;, u&lt;sub&gt;forward&lt;/sub&gt;), refl(c&lt;sub&gt;position&lt;/sub&gt;, u&lt;sub&gt;position&lt;/sub&gt;) }

Interestingly, this includes the position vertex, which is &quot;reflected&quot; through the origin.

This applies to all reference frames where the 'parent' reference frame is stored in the coordinates of the 'child' reference frame. The author cannot think of any other examples of this scenario.

== The Projection Transformation ==

The projection transformation should be used only to fit the camera into the viewport. glOrtho*(), glFrustum(), and gluPerspective() are typically used to accomplish this goal. 

The 'camera' frame -- either as specified above, or via gluLookAt() -- will normally be the &quot;bottom&quot; frame on the modelview matrix stack. This matrix converts from universe to camera coordinates. The projection matrix precedes the modelview matrix in multiplication order, so that the projection matrix may be considered the transformation to screen coordinates from camera coordinates.

Using the 'camera' frame is indistinguishable from using gluLookAt() (FIXME: Check for congruence), though the parameterization of the two operations is somewhat different.

== Summary ==
By viewing the transformation matrix as a reference frame composed of four column vectors 
{ c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; }
decompose the matrix into more usable properties:
* The &quot;right&quot; axis: c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.direction()
* The &quot;up&quot; axis: c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.direction()
* The &quot;forward&quot; axis: c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.direction()
* The &quot;position&quot;: c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* The &quot;x&quot; scale: c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.magnitude()
* The &quot;y&quot; scale: c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.magnitude()
* The &quot;z&quot; scale: c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.magnitude()
* The &quot;w&quot; scale: c&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.magnitude()

We can use these properties to implement motion more intuitively:
* Move forward distance &amp;beta;: xform += { 0, 0, 0, &amp;beta;*c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; }
* Move up distance &amp;gamma;: xform += {0, 0, 0, &amp;gamma;*c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; }
* Turn to the left 30 degrees: xform *= rotation_matrix(axis = c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, angle = &amp;pi;/6.0)
and so forth.

We can transform from the &amp;quot;current&amp;quot; reference frame (ie, the one represented
by the Modelview matrix in the context of OpenGL) to a &quot;child&quot; reference frame by simply
multiplying the reference frame matrix (constructed as above) to the current matrix. A 
complete drawing operation may be performed by:

  glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
  glLoadMatrixd(camera_refframe_matrix);
  glPushMatrix();
    glMultMatrixd(object_refframe_matrix);
    draw_object();
    glPushMatrix();
      glMultMatrixd(subobject_refframe_matrix);
      draw_sub_object();
    glPopMatrix();
  glPopMatrix();
  glFlush();

:I think it's a little bit confusing as for the beginner in OpenGL and 3d graphics [[User:213.184.8.92|213.184.8.92]] 08:16, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
-------------------------------------------------
Understandable. Maybe it should be an appendix - it really should be placed after all explanations of the translation-rotation-scaling operations at least.

While somewhat confusing, its purpose is to put those transformations into perspective (no pun intended) for use in more complex systems - the first projects I did ended up completely hosed as I had trouble figuring out where my &quot;camera&quot; was and where things were in the world, and didn't know how to properly build the modelview matrix to represent them. This intends to answer that question (do you feel it does?)

It should also definitely be after the &quot;Deadly 3D Math&quot; section, which hasn't been written yet. Not sure of the math background of readers of this wikibook... [[User:Lyngvi|Lyngvi]] 09:15, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</text>

==History of the Centrifuge==
Centrifuges were first used in the mid-1400s for processes such as separation of milk.  These early machines were hand driven and could reach speeds up to 3000rpm. By 1912 new centrifuges were developed which ran on electrical power. 

===Svedberg and the Ultracentrifuge===
[[Image:The-svedberg-1.jpg|thumb|Theodor Svedberg]]
In 1926 [[Wikipedia:en:Theodor Svedberg|Theodor Svedberg]] (1884-1971) received a Nobel Prize for his work in colloid chemistry and invention of the ultracentrifuge.  During the 1920’s-30’s his group built a number of ultracentrifuges capable of reaching 900,000xg.  These models had very small rotors.  Larger rotors were used for routine work.  Svedberg used his centrifuge to determine the molecular weights and subunit structure of highly complex proteins such as hemoglobin.  The results of these studies shaped new ideas about the structures of proteins.  His later work in nuclear chemistry helped improvements of the cyclotron.  Svedberg also aided in the development of electrophoresis by one of his students, [[Wikipedia:en:Arne Tiselius|Arne Tiselius]] (see [[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis|Protein Separations– Electrophoresis]]).

===Isolating Cellular Components===
During the early 1930s Martin Behrens worked to improve density gradient techniques involving centrifugation.  He has been credited with the introduction of density gradient centrifugation as a means of separating and isolating cells and subcellular components.  His approaches to tissue fractionation, as well as those of Bensley and others, had a major aim the isolation from disrupted cells of one or more identifiable components that could then be physically and chemically characterized. The principal method of analysis was light microscopy. In this sense, their approach was strictly preparative and is to be contrasted with the more analytical procedures of Claude and his successors who were concerned with the purity of centrifugally isolated fractions, examining their enzymatic activities and questioning whether certain properties were unique to specific types of sub-cellular particles or were more broadly distributed.
  
In 1942 [[Wikipedia:en:Albert Claude|Dr. Albert Claude]] and Dr. James S. Potter published a paper entitled “Isolation of Chromatin Threads from the Resting Nucleus of Leukemic Cells”.  In this landmark work they outlined a process involving a series of centrifugation steps.   During these steps either the supernate or the sediment was collected until the finally “chromatin threads” were retrieved from the final sediment.

==Modern Centrifuges==
In 1940 SPINCO produced the first commercial ultracentrifuge.  Beckman Instruments bought out Spinco in 1954 and continued making ultracentrifuges.  This company is now known as [[Wikipedia:en:Beckman Coulter|Beckman Coulter]] and is still a major manufacturer of centrifgues today.  A picture of a Beckman Coulter Avanti J-E centrifuge can be seen below.  Many improvements in the design of these machines lead to the tool used today.  The drive system was upgraded to high speed motors and the material used for the rotor was updated.  Original rotors, such as those built by Svedberg, were made of tensile steel.  Today materials such as aluminum alloys and titanium are used to withstand high centrifugal forces.  Vacuum systems were added to reduce friction and maintain temperature control.  The development of other tools, such as electron microscopes, allowed researchers to better examine the particles being centrifuged.  Scientists were then able to visualize organelles separated with the ultracentrifuge and characterize their structure-functional relationships.

[[Image:Beckman Coulter Centrifuge.JPG]] 

Many different centrifuges are available today.  They range in size from bench top centrifuges basket volumes of 1.2 liters and maximum loads of 1.5 kg like the eppendorf becnhtop centrifuge seen below to large free standing centrifuges with basket volume of 5 liters and maximum loads of 6 kg or larger.  Some of the smaller centrifuges have maximum rotational speeds of less than 300rpms while the larger machines can reach up to powers of 10,000rpms at a time.

'''Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma'''


==Epidemiology==
*Incidence: 2-3.5% in resected lung specimens; probably higher in inoperable patients due to its aggressive nature
*Etiology: Smoking probably causative; 85-95% of patients have history of heavy tobacco use
*Median age at diagnosis: 66 years
*Present predominately in lung periphery (cough, hemoptysis, or post-obstructive PNA are not common presenting symptoms)


==Histology==
*Historically grouped under neuroendocrine tumors of the lung (small cell, atypical carcinoid (LCNEC), typical carcinoid)
*In 1999 reassigned by WHO to Large Cell Carcinoma group, which includes several other unrelated but large cell histologies
*Cell size is typically 3X larger than for small cell CA
*Mitotic index is high, approaching that of small cell CA
*Cells contain neurosecretory granules, and typically stain positive for either neural cell adhesion molecule, chromogranin A, or synaptophysin
*Molecular markers suggest similarity of LCNEC and SCC, and difference from other large cell histologies (Ki-67+, p53+, Rb-)


==Survival==
*5-year OS of resected patients: ~30-40%
*Stage-adjusted survival is significantly worse than NSCLC


==Treatment Overview==
*Most series reported are surgical
*Currently no definitive survival advantage for adjuvant chemotherapy
*Octreotide may have activity, and appears to control metastatic disease


*'''Washington University, 2005''' (1988-2002) PMID 15999058 -- &quot;Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma: an aggressive form of non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; (Battafarano RJ, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2005 Jul;130(1):166-72.)
**Retrospective. 2099 resected patients in database, 82 (4%) had large cell histology. LCNEC 45 patients, 50% Stage IA
**5-year OS: overall 47%; LCNEC 30%, mixed neuroendocrine 30%, large cell carcinoma 71% (SS). Stage I LCNEC 5-year OS 32%
**Conclusion: LCNEC significantly worse survival after resection, even in Stage I disease

==Review==
*'''2006''' PMID 17075564 -- &quot;Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung.&quot; (Fernandez FG, Cancer Control. 2006 Oct;13(4):270-5.)
**Recommend classifying separately from NSCLC as ''Grade III neuroendocrine carcinoma, large-cell type''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== OpenGL Installation on Linux ==

Most Linux distributions rely on the [http://www.mesa3d.org/ Mesa3D] project to provide their OpenGL implementation. This supplies libraries for regular OpenGL as well as OpenGL ES 1.''x'' and 2.0.

The exact names of the packages you need to install are highly dependent on distribution. Referring to your distro's packages can save you a lot of time and headache in installation. Use your favorite package manager and search for the package name. You may need to install packages that come with a ''dev'' suffix, these are development packages (usually header files). Also look for packages with a ''lib'' prefix, which refer to libraries.

Install the GCC C/C++ compilers and associated tools such as ''make''.

All in all, install 
* mesa
* make
* gcc

== Libraries ==

In this wikibooks, we'll make great use of GLEW, FreeGLUT and GLM, make sure you install the development libraries:

* glew
* freeglut
* glm

If GLM is not available in your distribution repository, you have the option to install it manually. Make sure the headers end in the &lt;code&gt;/usr/include/glm&lt;/code&gt; directory. Since it's a headers-only library, you do not need to compile a .so library - just copy the code there.

== Drivers ==

OpenGL is the primary 3D graphics API on GNU/Linux-based systems. If your device supports 3D acceleration on GNU/Linux, it probably includes an OpenGL distribution.

OpenGL is included in drivers, so you'll have to make sure drivers are properly installed if you want to enjoy programs using OpenGL.
Open source drivers actually make use of Mesa's OpenGL implementation. Proprietary drivers embed their own OpenGL library.

=== Proprietary options ===

Nvidia provides generally excellent but non-free drivers via the ''nvidia'' driver from their website.
''fglrx'' drives many modern AMD devices; it is also closed-source, and available from AMD's website.

=== Free/Open-Source options ===

If your CPU is an Intel one with built-in graphics, then the necessary open-source drivers come as a standard part of the Linux kernel.

If you have one of the newest chips, you may be forced to use the mediocre fglrx driver. However since AMD released the specifications for their chips, the open source 'radeon' made its way to become a full-featured 2D and 3D driver.

As of June 2013, most AMD chips will run well with the open source 'radeon' driver. 3D performance is still better with the AMD Catalyst driver on modern cards, but this may change in the future. 
Check [http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature the feature matrix] for a completion status.

The open-source [http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/ nouveau] driver supports nVidia chipsets, but at the time of writing is not as complete as nVidia's closed-source drivers, 3D support may not be satisfactory.

The OpenGL driver on Linux systems consists of two files:
* libGL.so for the GL itself; libGL.so must be accessible to the Linux library loader (refer to man pages for ldconfig);
* glx.so (this name may vary) for Xorg support for OpenGL; glx.so will be in Xorg's extensions path and must be loaded by xorg.conf (refer to man pages for xorg.conf).

Many OpenGL applications require libGLU.so as well; GLU operations are not hardware-accelerated, so the implementation provided by Mesa is an excellent option.

== Check your OpenGL installation ==

Type this in a terminal to get much info about your OpenGL driver, including supported extensions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
glxinfo | grep OpenGL
&lt;/source&gt;

== IDEs ==

The tutorials will mostly rely on simple &lt;code&gt;Makefile&lt;/code&gt;s to build the code, and let you edit the source with your favorite text editor, such as Emacs, vim, gedit, kwrite, etc.

Several IDEs exist for GNU/Linux, such as:
* Code::Blocks
* Anjuta
* KDevelop
* Eclipse CDT

It is very simple to adapt the Makefiles to these environments.

== Installing your own OpenGL headers ==

In the unlikely event that your distribution does not supply packages for Mesa3D, you can build it from source with the usual
  ./configure
  make
  make install
installation procedure; however, '''be careful of conflicting opengl libraries'''. 

Mesa's software implementation may override your distribution's libraries or libraries manually installed, such as the ''nvidia'' or ''fglrx'' OpenGL binaries.
When this happens, search all directories listed with
 ldconfig -Nv 2&gt;/dev/null | awk -F: '/^\// {print $1}'
for libGL.so.
The following command should output all the different OpenGL libraries available on your system:
 find $(ldconfig -Nv 2&gt;/dev/null | awk -F: '/^\// {print $1}') -name libGL.so -exec realpath {} \; | sort -u
It is usually OK if you have one the mesa library plus the proprietary library. On 64-bits systems, you may also have the lib32 library.
Additional copies of libGL.so found in the ld search path (specified in /etc/lf.so.conf by default), if not referring to the same file, usually indicates a conflict. Remove all but the copy you want executed.

The headers will be installed to $PREFIX/include/GL (usually /usr/include/GL when installed from a packaged, or /usr/local/include/GL when installed manually from source).

&quot;Official&quot; OpenGL headers are available from SGI, however, they are hopelessly out of date.

&lt;!-- Lesson --&gt;
[[Image:IMG 6887-Buchara.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Girls in Bukhara]]
This lesson is divided up into several sections. After your done you'll be ready to have your very first conversation in Uzbek. Sure, it'll be real simple—but you'll know how to greet somebody, introduce yourself, ask some polite questions, and say goodbye. If you want to do it intensive (which I'd recommend) you can do this all as one lesson. If you don't have much time the dialogues are broken up into four sections—just do one. (Eventually I think we'll merge all four tiny dialogues)

==Cultural Notes==

Uzbeks make up over 70 percent of the population of the Central Asian country called Uzbekistan. Many Uzbeks also live in neighboring regions of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. Even today Uzbeks live close to the land, most of the engaged in farming and other rural occupations.

The extended family and neighborhood play extremely important roles in the lives of the Uzbeks. Senior family members, elders of the neighborhood, and older people in general are shown great respect. Although many social activities are organized in Uzbek neighborhoods and villages, men and woman are segregated by sex at many of them. Under Soviet rule, some Uzbeks had considerable contact with Russians, but few have experience with individuals from the West. Nonetheless, they are thrilled to meet individuals who wish to learn about and appreciate their rich culture.

Even Uzbeks of modest means are extremely generous toward their guests. When a stranger arrives at an Uzbek household, he is first invited and offered tea and other refreshments. Only then does the host ask who the guest is and why he has come. 

Uzbek etiquette is very elaborate. For example, it is considered impolite to enter or exit a room before a person of higher status. Frequently a group of Uzbeks will pause before entering a building to insist that someone else enter first. The intricacies of such courtesies may take a long time to learn.

When Uzbek men meet, they greet each other with their right hand on their chest. Generally, the younger man initiates the greeting and then the senior one responds. The senior man may extend a hand for a handshake, but it is not the custom for the younger one to do so first.

When Uzbek women meet they often use a different form of greeting than do men. When adult women greet each other or youths they place their right hand on the left shoulder of the other person. But when a woman greets an adult man she places her right hand on her chest and generally maintains a distance from him.

Upon greeting a woman, an Uzbek man does not extend his hand to her. If the woman reaches out to the man in such encounters, he may respond by extending his hand for a handshake.

Such customs are more strictly observed in rural areas. In big cities, especially in Tashkent, any Uzbeks have adopted Russian habits. For example, woman in larger cities are more likely to shake a man's hand. The Russian ways are especially common among younger people.

==Grammar and Vocabulary Explanations==
===For Dialogue 1===
The greeting ''Assalomu Alaykum''! is a very common expression throughout the Muslim world, among Uzbeks it is especially common in the more conservative rural areas. It is from an Arabic greeting meaning ''peace be upon you!'' The invariable response must be ''Vaalaykum Assalom!'' which is also from an Arabic greeting meaning ''I also wish you peace!''

Uzbeks also have other greetings used for different times of day. The most appropriate response for any of these greetings is to repeat the greeting.

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Forms of Greeting||0|3|}}
|-
| Xayrli erta!
| Good Morning!
|-
| Xayrli kun!
| Good Afternoon!
|-
| Xayrli oqshom!
| Good Evening!
|-
| Xayrli kech!
| Good Night!
|-
| Yaxshimisiz!
| How are you?
|-
| Omonmisiz!
| How are you?
|-
| Esonmisiz!
| How are you?
|-
| Salom!
| Hello
|-
|}

Omonmisiz! is mostly used by woman.

===For Dialogue 2===
From Previous Lessons:

Standard Uzbek has both singular and plural pronouns:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Pronouns||0|4||}}
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|'''Plural'''
|
|-
| men
| I
| biz
| we
|-
| sen
| you
| siz
| you
|-
| u
| he, she, it
| ular
| they
|-
|}

The second person pronoun ''sen'' is used to address one or more friends and equals or those who are younger or familiar. ''Siz'' must be used to address those who are older or unfamiliar, and also to address more than one person.

The third person pronoun у can refer to males, females, or things. Gender can be determined from context.

''Mening'' ('my') is a possessive form of the personal pronoun ''men''. The singular and plural possessive forms of the personal pronouns are:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Pronouns (Possessive)||0|4|}}
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|'''Plural'''
|
|-
| mening
| my
| bizning
| our
|-
| sening
| your
| sizning
| your
|-
| uning
| his, her, its
| ularning
| their
|-
|}

The possessive forms of the personal pronouns can be omitted when a noun already reflects possession.

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Example||0|3|}}
|-
|Mening ismim - Erkin.
|'My name+my is Erkin'
|-
|Ismim - Erkin
|'Name+my is Erkin'
|-
|}

The suffix ''-man'' 'I am', expresses person and is a noun predicate. The singular and plural noun suffixes in standard Uzbek are:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Noun Suffixes||0|4|}}
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|'''Plural'''
|
|-
| -man
| 'I am'
| -miz
| 'we are'
|-
| -san
| 'you are'
| -siz
| 'you are'
|-
| (no suffix)
| he, she, it is
| -lar
| they are
|-
|}

The subject pronoun may be omitted in a sentence where one of these predicate suffixes are used.

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Example||0|3| |}}
|-
| Men oʻqituvchiman.
| Oʻqituvchiman.
|-
|'I (am a) teacher+I am'
|'Teacher+I am'
|}

===For Dialogue 3===
The plural suffix is -lar. It is added to the stem of the noun:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Plural suffix (-lar)||0|4|}}
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|'''Plural'''
|
|-
| talaba
| student
| talabalar
| students
|-
| ish
| work
| ishlar
| works
|-
|}

When the Uzbeks ask someone about his well-being they usually use expressions like ''Ishlaringiz qanday?'' (How are you?), ''Ishlaringiz yaxshimi?'' (How are things?). The response may be ''Yaxshi'' (Good), ''Ishlarim Yaxshi'' (Everything is fine), or ''Rahmat'' (Thanks).

The question particle is ''-mi''. In order to form an interrogative sentence this particle is added only to the predicate of a sentence:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Question Particle Example||0|2|}}
|-
| U talabami?
| Is he a student?
|-
|}
====Pronunciation====
Questions formed with the help of the particle -mi are pronounced with a rising intonation. In the sentence ''Ishlaringiz yaxshimi?'' (How are things?), the peak of intonation is on the second syllable of ''yaxshi''.

Questions formed with the help of the interrogative words like ''qanday'' (how) are pronounced with falling intonation. In the sentence ''Ishlaringiz qanday?'' (How are you?), the low point of intonation is on the second syllable of ''qanday''.

===For Dialogue 4===
As Uzbeks take leave of one another, they commonly exchange a series of expressions meaning goodbye. Some of these are:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Forms of Greeting||0|3|}}
|-
| Xayr!
| Goodbye!
|-
| Xayr, Yaxshi boring!
| Goodbye, go in peace!
|-
| Koʻrishguncha!
| See you later!
|-
| Uchrashguncha!
| Meet you later!
|-
| Ertagʻacha
| Until Tomorrow
|-
| Tuningiz xayrli boʻlsin!
| Good night!
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The parting expression ''Xayr!'' may be used at any time of day. The expression ''Xayr, yaxshi qoling! is used by a guest or by the person taking leave. The expression ''Xayr, yakshi boring!'' is used by a host or by the person staying.

The Uzbek word ''xoʻp'' has many meanings, including 'fine,' 'very well,' 'agreed,' 'all right,' and 'O.K.' Uzbeks use ''xoʻp'' and ''yaxshi'' much as English speakers use 'fine', and 'good'.

==Recap==
&lt;!-- Recap --&gt;
Congratulations! You can know have your first ever conversation in Uzbek—and that wasn't that hard either? Was it? 

In future editions of this book we might have exercises and such, so that you can practice what you learned, and really get it to soak in—and also so you can double check and make sure you know it. But they aren't available just yet :)

==Epidemiology==
*3rd most common gynecologic malignancy in US. 10,370 cases/yr and 3,710 deaths/yr in US (in 2005).  
*Worldwide, is the second most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer mortality in women.
*Was the most common cause of cancer deaths in US women in the 1930s, but due to improved screening incidence decreased from 32.6/100,000 in 1940's to 8.3/100,000 in 1980's
*Increased risk: HPV 16/18, HSV2, early age at initiation of sexual activity, tobacco, DES, lower socioeconomic status, current use of oral contraceptives
*Presence of cervical Ca in the setting of HIV denotes AIDS status


'''Oral contraceptives'''
*'''Meta-analysis; 2007''' PMID 17993361 -- &quot;Cervical cancer and hormonal contraceptives: collaborative reanalysis of individual data for 16,573 women with cervical cancer and 35,509 women without cervical cancer from 24 epidemiological studies.&quot; (Appleby P, Lancet. 2007 Nov 10;370(9599):1609-21.)
**Central review of 16,573 women with cervical CA compared with 35,509 women without
**Outcome: current users had 1.9x risk compared to never use. Risk declined after stopping, and returned to baseline by 10 years

==Anatomy==
*Inferior portion of the uterus. Has supravaginal (endocervix) and vaginal (ectocervix) portions
*Barrel-shaped; measures 2.5-3 cm in adult multigravida female 
*Composed of:
**''Ectocervix'' - intravaginal portion
**''External os'' - opening of the cervix into the vagina
**''Endocervix'' - cervical canal, which connects external os with the internal os
**''Internal os'' - opening of the cervix into the uterine cavity


'''Lymphatic Drainage'''
*Cervix (3 separate routes)
**Laterally, along uterine artery to external iliac LNs
**Posterolaterally, behind ureters to internal iliac LNs
**Posteriorly, into common illac and lateral sacral LNs

*Fundus of uterus
**Mainly to internal iliac LNs via broad ligament 
**Some to para-aortics via ovarian vessels
**Some to external iliac and inguinal LNs via round ligament

*Upper third vagina
**Laterally to both internal and external iliac LNs

*Middle third vagina
**Internal iliac LNs alone

*Lower third vagina
**Merge with vulva into superficial inguinal

==Histology==
*[http://screening.iarc.fr/atlashisto_list.php?cat=B2&amp;lang=1 Ectocervix] (vaginal cervix) is typically squamous cell (nonkeratinizing, stratified)
*[http://screening.iarc.fr/atlashisto_list.php?cat=B3&amp;lang=1 Endocervix] (endocervical canal) is typically adeno (columnar epithelium, mucin-secreting)
*[http://screening.iarc.fr/atlashisto_list.php?cat=B4&amp;lang=1 Transformation zone] (ectropion) is where the tall columnar cells are transformed into flat squamous cells. This is the site of origin for squamous cell dysplasia and carcinoma, and may be located outside the os or within the canal


==Screening==
On exam, a barrel-shaped cervix is defined as an expanded cervix &gt; 4 cm diameter and indicates an endocervical tumor.

===HPV testing vs Pap smear===
*'''Finland''' (2003-2005) -- HPV DNA screen vs conventional cytology
**'''2010''' PMID 20423964 [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/apr27_1/c1804 Full Text] -- &quot;Rate of cervical cancer, severe intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma in situ in primary HPV DNA screening with cytology triage: randomised study within organised screening programme&quot; (Anttila A, BMJ 2010;340:c1804) 
**Randomized. 58,076 women, age 30-60, routine population-based screening program. Arm 1) HPV DNA test vs Arm 2) conventional cytological screening. Primary outcome cervical cancer, CIN-III and carcinoma in situ (both reported as CIN-III+)
***Outcome: CIN-III+ HPV 76 cases (6 cervical CA) vs cytology 53 cases (8 cervical CA)
***Conclusion: Primary HPV screening more sensitive than conventional cytology in detecting CIN-III+ lesions; number cervical cancer small

==Surgical staging==
*'''GOG 49''', 1990 (1981-84)
**732 pts, Stage I and &gt; 3 mm invasion (currently IA2), of which 645 pts were treated with radical hyst + paraaortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Pts with paraaortic mets were excluded. 
**'''1990''' PMID 2227547 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prospective surgical-pathological study of disease-free interval in patients with stage IB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.&quot; Delgado G et al. Gynecol Oncol. 1990 Sep;38(3):352-7.
***Worse DFS for pts with microscopically positive pelvic LN (3-yr DFI 74.4% vs 85.6%) but no difference in OS. DFI correlated with depth of invasion (94% vs 84% vs 74% by thirds), tumor size (94% occult, 85% &lt;3cm, 68% &gt;3cm), capillary-lymphatic invasion (88% vs 77%), grade (90% vs 86% vs 76%), parametrial involvement (85% vs 70%). For margin status, 84.3% vs 69.1% but N.S. Pelvic LN+ is not prognostic.
***Conclusion: Tumor size, depth of invasion, and CLS invasion (LVI) were independent factors for DFS 
**'''1989''' PMID 2599466 &amp;mdash; &quot;A prospective surgical pathological study of stage I squamous carcinoma of the cervix: a Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.&quot; Delgado G et al. Gynecol Oncol. 1989 Dec;35(3):314-20.
***Risk factors for pelvic LN+: capillary-lymphatic space involvement, depth of invasion, parametrial involvement, age.
**Comment: prognostic factors allow patients to be classified as low, intermediate, or high risk.  Led to the risk factors used in Sedlis's paper. See below.

'''Para-aortic nodes:'''
*'''GOG 19''', 1980 (1973-76)
**PMID 7353805 (no abstract) &amp;mdash; &quot;Results and complications of operative staging in cervical cancer: experience of the Gynecologic Oncology Group.&quot; Lagasse LD et al. Gynecol Oncol. 1980 Feb;9(1):90-8.
**290 pts, Stage IB-IVB. Underwent surgical exploration with sampling of bilateral paraaortic lymph nodes either in conjunction with radical hystectomy  (IB) or a separate procedure (II-IV). 
**Squamous (89%), adenosquamous (6%), adenocarcinoma (4%). About half were Stage IB. 36% of pts were upstaged by surgical exploration. 
**Positive para-aortic nodes in: Stage IB (5.6%), Stage II-IV (29.3%). Grade was not predictive of number with +PA LN. For adenocarcinoma, 33% had +PA (even though most had Stage IB). 
**Conclusion: implication for pts who have disease outside of standard RT field. Importance of surgical staging.

===Use of PET in staging===
*'''Chang Gung University, Taiwan''' (2002-2006) -- pretreatment PET vs no PET
**Randomized. 129 patients, Stage I-IVA cervical cancer, positive pelvic but negative PALN by MRI. Arm 1) pretreatment PET vs Arm 2) no PET. Treated with chemo-RT, standard pelvic fields. If PET+, extended to include PALN
**'''2010''' PMID 19464824 -- &quot;A prospective randomized trial to study the impact of pretreatment FDG-PET for cervical cancer patients with MRI-detected positive pelvic but negative para-aortic lymphadenopathy.&quot; (Tsai CS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2010 Feb 1;76(2):477-84. Epub 2009 May 21.)
***Outcome: PET identified 11% extra-pelvic mets; of these 57% remained disease free after modified fields. 4-year DFS PET+ 75% vs. PET- 77% (NS); 4-year OS 79% vs 85% (NS)
***Conclusion: Pretreatment PET can improve detection of pelvic mets, but may not translate into survival benefit

*'''Washington University'''
**'''2001''' PMID 11533097 &amp;mdash; &quot;Lymph node staging by positron emission tomography in patients with carcinoma of the cervix.&quot; Grigsby PW et al. J Clin Oncol. 2001 Sep 1;19(17):3745-9.
***Retrospective, 101 patients. Pts underwent CT and PET. +pelvic LN in 20% (CT) vs 67% (PET), +para-aortic LN in 7% vs 21%. 2-yr progression free status in (CT-/PET-): 64%, (CT-/PET+):18%, (CT+/PET+):14%.  
***Conclusion: PET is better at detecting abnormal lymph nodes than CT and is a better predictor for survival.
**'''SUV; 2010''' (2003-2008) PMID 20108309 -- &quot;Pelvic lymph node F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake as a prognostic biomarker in newly diagnosed patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.&quot; (Kidd EA, Cancer. 2010 Mar 15;116(6):1469-75.)
***Retrospective. 83 patients, Stage IB1 to IIIB cervical cancer. Average SVU cervix 14.0 (3.2-38.4), average SUV PLN 5.9 (2.1-33), average PLN size 2.1 cm (0.6-7.9)
***Outcome: SUV PLN correlated with increased risk of persistent disease (SS), pelvic recurrence (SS), DSS (SS) and OS (SS)
***Conclusion: SUV of pelvic LNs is predicts for outcome
**'''2010''' (2000-2009) PMID 20308664 -- &quot;Lymph node staging by positron emission tomography in cervical cancer: relationship to prognosis.&quot; (Kidd EA, J Clin Oncol. 2010 Apr 20;28(12):2108-13. Epub 2010 Mar 22.)
***Retrospective. 560 patients, Stage IA1-IVB, pretreatment PET staging. 
***Outcome: LN+ 47%, increasing with stage. Recurrence stratified by none, pelvic+ (HR 2.4), para-aortic+ (HR 5.9), or SCV+ (HR 30.3). If P+, 35% PA+, and 12% SCV+. All patients with PA+ had P+, all patients with SCV+ had PA+
***Conclusion: Nodal involvement by PET stratified patient recurrence and survival

==Prognostic Molecular Markers==
*PMID 15936552 -- '''Coexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 and thymidine phosphorylase as a prognostic indicator in patients with FIGO stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma of uterine cervix treated with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy.''' (Pyo H, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Thymidine phosphorylase expression or COX-2/TP coexpression may be used as a molecular prognostic marker for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. TP appears to be an important downstream molecule of COX-2 during angiogenesis and may be a new target for the treatment of uterine cervical cancer.&quot;

==Surgical treatment==
*'''Radical trachelectomy''' - removes all cancer with margin, but leave internal os. This is stitched closed, leaving a small opening for menses to escape. This arrangement can support a pregnancy, with baby born via C-section


'''''Classes of hysterectomy:'''''
*'''Piver''' classification, 1974 - PMID 4417035 &amp;mdash; &quot;Five classes of extended hysterectomy for women with cervical cancer.&quot; Piver MS et al. Obstet Gynecol. 1974 Aug;44(2):265-72.
**All classes (I-V) extend beyond the excision boundaries of a standard hysterectomy, such that all cervical tissue is removed
**'''Class I''' - '''Simple Extrafascial Hysterectomy''' - removes just the uterus and a small rim of vaginal cuff.  
**'''Class II''' - '''Modified Radical Hysterectomy''' - removes uterus, a 1-2 cm cuff of vagina, wide excision of parametrial and paravaginal tissues (median half of cardinal and uterosacral ligaments).  The ureters and uterine arteries and only partially mobilized (as in Class III). Ligates uterine artery at ureter. (Limited to cervical cancers with invasion up to 5 mm).
**'''Class III''' - '''Radical Hysterectomy''' (Wertheim-Meigs procedure) - classic operation. Removes uterus and upper 2/3 of vagina. Dissection of paravaginal and parametrial tissues to the pelvic sidewalls. Ligates uterine artery at its origin at the internal iliac A. Pelvic lymphadenectomy. 
**'''Class IV''' - '''Extended Radical Hysterectomy''' - same as Class III but adds full mobilization of the ureters past the bladder (which is the point to which they are mobilized in the Class II and Ill procedures). Removes more paracervical tissue medial to the uteter.
**'''Class V''' - '''Pelvic Exenteration''' - ''Anterior exenteration'' removes uterus, tubes, ovaries, vagina, and bladder.  ''Posterior exenteration'' removes uterus, tubes, ovaries, and rectosigmoid.  ''Total exenteration'' removes all pelvic organs.







===Treatment of the pregnant patient and fertility-sparing treatment===

*:Trachelectomy is a conservative surgery that is designed to spare the function of the organ. Uses laparascopic (for LN dissection) and transvaginal approaches. Used on patients &lt; 40 yrs old who have Stage Ia lesions with low risk of LN involvement or small volume Stage IB1-IIA lesions

*[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15516424 Abstract] [http://www.greenjournal.org/cgi/content/full/104/5/1129 Full Text] (Case Report) &amp;mdash; Ben-Arie et al. &quot;Conservative treatment of stage IA2 squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix during pregnancy.&quot; Obstet Gynecol. 2004 Nov;104(5 Pt 2):1129-31.

==Non-surgical treatment==
===Benefit of chemotherapy===
*Meta-analysis shows benefit


'''Meta-Analysis'''

**Individual patient data analysis. 15 trials with 3,452 patients
**2 chemo-RT + chemo vs RT trials: 5-year OS 79% vs. 60% (HR 0.46, SS): 19% absolute improvement
**13 chemo-RT vs. RT trials: 5-year OS 66% vs. 60% (HR 0.81, SS): 6% absolute improvement
**No difference between platinum-based (HR 0.83) and non-platinum-based (HR 0.77) chemo. Benefit by stage I-IIA 10%, IIB 7%, III-IVA 3%
**Conclusion: There is a survival benefit for chemo-RT over RT alone

*'''Canada, 2002''' - PMID 12109823 — &quot;Concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy plus radiotherapy for cervical cancer--a meta-analysis.&quot; Lukka H et al. Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2002 Jun;14(3):203-12.

**4580 pts from randomized studies.
**Pts most likely to benefit from concurrent chemotherapy are those with: positive pelvic lymph nodes, large cervical lesions. Concurrent chemotherapy reduced incidence of distant mets


'''Population Study'''
*'''Ontario, 2007''' (1992-2001) PMID 17557951 -- &quot;Impact of adoption of chemoradiotherapy on the outcome of cervical cancer in Ontario: results of a population-based cohort study.&quot; (Pearcey R, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jun 10;25(17):2383-8.)
**Retrospective. 4069 women. Primary RT used for 42% patients. In 1992-1998 &lt;10% concurrent RT, in 1999-2001 &gt;60% concurrent RT
**3-year OS: RT alone 59% vs. CRT 70% (SS); no change over time in those with surgery only
**Conclusion: Adoption of CRT significant improvement in OS at the population level, consistent with results from randomized trials


===Patterns of failure===
For RT alone:
*PMID 1129485 (1964-69) - &quot;Analysis of sites and causes of failures of irradiation in invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the intact uterine cervix.&quot;
:94% of failures in first 3 years. Stage I-IIA: 6% LRF, Stage IIB: 18%, Stage III: 33%. Main predictor of failure is massive disease.

'''Cervical Cancer - Early Stage Non-bulky (IB1 and IIA &lt;4cm)'''


==Surgery vs. RT==
*No survival or DFS difference
*Severe toxicity (Grade 2-3) significantly higher in surgery
*Advantages to surgery: preserve gonadal function (and avoid early menopause), avoid shortening/fibrosis of vagina, assess LN status
*Advantages to RT: easy to deliver if poor surgical candidate, lower risk of complications
*Combined surgery + RT highest rate of complications


*'''Milan, 1997''' (1986-91) PMID 9284774 — &quot;Randomised study of radical surgery versus radiotherapy for stage Ib-IIa cervical cancer.&quot; Landoni F et al. Lancet. 1997 Aug 23;350(9077):535-40.
**Randomized. 343 patients. Stage IB-IIA (Ib1 61%, Ib2 27%, IIA 12%) Treated with radical hysterectomy (Class III) vs. radical RT. Median F/U 87 mo. 
**RT given: EBRT to median 47 Gy followed by LDR x1 for Point A median dose 76 Gy. Adjuvant RT allowed for pts who were surgical stage IIB or greater, &lt;3mm of safe cervical stroma, positive margins, or positive LN (62/114 IB1, 46/55 IB2).
**63% of pts in surgery arm received RT.  
**5-year outcome: no difference; Non-bulky: OS surgery 87% vs. RT 90% (NS), DFS surgery 80% vs. 82% (NS)
**AdenoCA: significantly better outcomes with surgery; OS (70% vs. 59%), DFS (66% vs. 47%)
**Complications (Grade 2-3): Surgery 28% vs RT 12% (SS). Severe leg edema surgery 0%, RT 1%, surgery + RT 9%
**Conclusion: Surgery and RT are both acceptable treatments for early stage cervical ca; (for bulky, primary surgery not a good option)

==Surgery +/- Post-op RT==
25% of Stage IB pts may benefit from XRT because they have positive risk factors, which were originally delineated in a surgical series from GOG 49. 

*'''GOG 49''', Delgado (1981-1984)
** Prospective cohort study of 732 patients (645 evaluated) with stage 1 squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with greater than or equal to 3mm of invasion required to undergo radical hysterectomy, paraaortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy and peritoneal cytology. Analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors associated with disease-free interval (DFI), or the time between study entry to physical or radiological evidence of disease recurrence or date last seen. 
**'''1990''' PMID 2227547 &amp;mdash; &quot;Prospective Surgical-Pathological Study of Disease-Free Interval in Patients with Stage IB Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Cervix: A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.&quot; Delgado, et al. GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY 38, 352-357 (1990)
**Disease free interval (DFI) correlated strongly with depth of tumor invasion (both in absolute mm and in fractional thirds), tumor size, and capillary-lymphatic space (CLS) invasion [ie, LVSI]. 
*** Depth of Invasion
**** DFI 94.1% for superficial third invasion
**** DFI 84.5% for middle third invasion
**** DFI 73.6% for deep third invasion
*** Tumor Size
**** DFI 94.8% for occult tumor
**** DFI 88.1% for tumor &lt;=3cm
**** DFI 67.6% for tumor &gt;3cm
*** CLS [LVSI]
**** DFI 77.0% if present
**** DFI 88.9% if absent


*'''GOG 92''', Sedlis, (1988-95)
**277 pts. Randomized. Stage IB, node negative, but with high estimated risk of recurrence (from GOG 49) s/p radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy randomized to +/- adjuvant pelvic XRT 46-50.4 Gy. Included pts with: 1) CLS involved, deep 1/3 stromal invasion, any size; 2) CLS involved, middle 1/3 invasion, size &gt;= 2cm; 3) CLS involved, superficial 1/3 invasion, &gt;= 5 cm; or 4) CLS not involved, deep or middle 1/3 invasion, &gt;= 4 cm. These pts were estimated to have a 31% recurrence at 3 yrs.
**'''1999''' PMID 10329031 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized trial of pelvic radiation therapy versus no further therapy in selected patients with stage IB carcinoma of the cervix after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy: A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.&quot; Sedlis A et al. Gynecol Oncol. 1999 May;73(2):177-83.
***Recurrences in 15% (RT) vs 28% (no RT). 2-year recurrence free rate 88% vs 79%. Hazard ratio=0.53. Grade 3/4 adverse effects were 6% vs 2.1% Distant mets 2% (RT) vs 7% (no RT).  Follow up too short for survival analysis.
**'''2006''' PMID 16427212 &amp;mdash; &quot;A phase III randomized trial of postoperative pelvic irradiation in Stage IB cervical carcinoma with poor prognostic features: follow-up of a gynecologic oncology group study.&quot; Rotman M et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 May 1;65(1):169-76. 
***Decreased rate of recurrence by 46%; local recurrence 13.9% (RT) vs 20.7% (no RT), distant 2.9% vs 8.6%. Improved PFS by 42%. Decreased death rate by 30% (28.6% vs 19.7%) but not S.S. (p=0.07). RT has improved benefit for adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous histologies (8.8% vs 44% recurrence).



'''Sedlis criteria''' often simplified to needing 2 or more of these factors:
* CLS (LVI) involvement
*deep stromal invasion (middle or deep third); [i.e &gt;1/3 stromal invasion]
*Size &gt; 4 cm

==Surgery + Post-op RT vs. Post-op CRT==
'''High risk features:'''
*microscopic involvement of the parametrium (upstaged to IIB)
*positive pelvic lymph nodes (upstaged to IIIB)
*positive surgical margins


*'''GOG 109 / Intergroup 0107 / SWOG 8797 / RTOG 9112''' (1991-96) 
**Randomized, 268 patients.  Post-operative clinical stage IA2, IB, and IIA, s/p radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, with ''high risk features'' (positive pelvic lymph nodes, positive margins, or microscopic involvement of the parametrium). Randomized to RT vs RT+CT.  Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 70 mg/m^2 and a 96-hour infusion of fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m^2/d every 3 weeks x four cycles (1st and 2nd cycles concurrent with RT). RT 49.3 Gy in 29 fractions (1.7 Gy/fx). 45 Gy (1.5 Gy/fx) given to paraaortic area if positive common iliac LN.
**'''4-years; 2000''' - PMID 10764420 &amp;mdash; &quot;Concurrent chemotherapy and pelvic radiation therapy compared with pelvic radiation therapy alone as adjuvant therapy after radical surgery in high-risk early-stage cancer of the cervix.&quot; (Peters WA 3rd et al. J Clin Oncol. 2000 Apr;18(8):1606-13.)
***Outcome: 4-year OS RT 71% vs CRT 81%, HR=2.0 (SS); 4-year PFS 63% vs 80%, HR=2.0 (SS). Local failure 17% vs 6%. No difference in outcome based on histology (squamous vs adeno) for patients who underwent chemo-RT 
***Toxicity: Grade 4+ RT 4% vs CRT 17% (mainly hematologic)
***Conclusion: Addition of cisplatin based chemotherapy to RT significantly improves progression free survival and overall survival following surgery for high-risk, early stage patients
**'''LN; 2005''' PMID 15721417 &amp;mdash; &quot;Rethinking the use of radiation and chemotherapy after radical hysterectomy: a clinical-pathologic analysis of a Gynecologic Oncology Group/Southwest Oncology Group/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial.&quot; Monk BJ et al. Gynecol Oncol. 2005 Mar;96(3):721-8.
***Smaller benefit for chemo+RT when only 1 LN is positive (79% versus 83% OS at 5 years) or if tumor was ≤2 cm (77% versus 82%).

==Adjuvant RT vs Adjuvant Chemo==
*'''Gachon University (Korea); 2008''' PMID 18021218 -- &quot;Comparison of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation in patients with intermediate risk factors after radical surgery in FIGO stage IB-IIA cervical cancer.&quot; (Lee KB, Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2008 Sep-Oct;18(5):1027-31. Epub 2007 Nov 16.)
**Retrospective. 80 patients, FIGO Stage IB-IIA cervical cancer, s/p radical hysterectomy and PLND, with intermediate risk factors (&gt;50% stromal invasion, LVI, bulky, or close SM). Treated with RT (n=42) or chemo (n=38). Comparable risk factors
**Outcome: No difference in DFS, OS not reached
**Conclusion: Adjuvant chemo in Stage IB-IIA cervical cancer with intermediate risk factors after surgery may be effective

==RT Technique==

      <text xml:space="preserve">After your naming service (and other services are running), the presence of your services can be tested for by trying the following:
 tao_nslist -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:12345/NameService

This should then produce the following output:
 Naming Service:
 ---------

Where your named services appear below the dashed line.

Now to actually connect the two applications. To make our previous example Naming Service aware, we need to add in the code to attach to the Naming Service, then, resolve our service from within that context. The following code, put in place of the code to bring in the IOR from the command line resolves a reference to the factory object using a human readable URL from the command line which is persistent from reboot to reboot. Here's the code snippet we'll be applying:

&lt;source lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;corbalocC.h&quot;
#include &quot;orbsvcs/CosNamingC.h&quot;

#include &quot;ace/SString.h&quot;

ACE_TString corbaloc_url_;
CosNaming::NamingContextExt_var naming_context_;
corbaloc_url_ = argv[1];

// Get a reference to the Naming Service
CORBA::Object_var naming_context_object =
orb-&gt;string_to_object (corbaloc_url_.c_str());

// Narrow to get the correct reference
naming_context_ =
CosNaming::NamingContextExt::_narrow (naming_context_object.in ());

//Setup to get service from within the naming context
CosNaming::Name name (1);

name.length (1);
name[0].id = CORBA::string_dup (&quot;Widgits&quot;);

// Resolve the name
CORBA::Object_var factory_object =
naming_context_-&gt;resolve (name);

// Narrow
corbaloc::Status_var factory =
corbaloc::Status::_narrow (factory_object.in ());

//And use as desired
factory-&gt; ... do something
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the code is potentially all boiler plate which can be placed in a reusable function. The only two original parts of the code are the URL pulled in from the command line, and the string representing the name of or remote class, &quot;Widgets&quot;.

 ./client corbaloc::localhost:12345/NameService

In this example, everything is on one box, but in reality, none of these services need be running on the same hardware, they only need to be reachable by the indicated ports. Now, lets take a look at the client code.

===Exercise 1===

 main :: IO ()
 main = do args &lt;- getArgs
           putStrLn (&quot;Hello, &quot; ++ args!!0 ++ &quot; &quot; ++ args!!1)

===Exercise 2===

 main :: IO ()
 main = do args &lt;- getArgs
           print ((read $ args!!0) + (read $ args!!1))

The &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; operator reduces the number of parentheses needed here. Alternatively you could write the function applications as &lt;code&gt;read (args!!0)&lt;/code&gt;.

===Exercise 3===

 main :: IO ()
 main = do putStrLn &quot;What do they call thee at home?&quot;
           name &lt;- getLine
           putStrLn (&quot;Ey up &quot; ++ name)

==Section 3 - Parsing==

=== Exercise 1 ===

==== Part 1 ====

 parseNumber :: Parser LispVal
 parseNumber = do x &lt;- many1 digit
                 (return . Number . read) x

==== Part 2 ====

In order to anwer this question, you need to do a bit of detective work!  It is helpful to read up on [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/all_about_monads#Do_notation do notation].  Using the information there, we can mechanically transform the above answer into the following.

 parseNumber = many1 digit &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; (return . Number . read) x

This can be cleaned up into the following:

 parseNumber = many1 digit &gt;&gt;= return . Number . read

{{auto category}}
{{auto category|Haskell/Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours}}

=== Exercise 2 ===

We need to create a new parser action that accepts a backslash followed by either another backslash or a doublequote.  This action needs to return only the second character.

 escapedChars :: Parser Char
 escapedChars = do char '\\' -- a backslash
                   x &lt;- oneOf &quot;\\\&quot;&quot; -- either backslash or doublequote
                   return x -- return the escaped character

Once that is done, we need to make some changes to parseString.

 parseString :: Parser LispVal
 parseString = do char '&quot;'
                  x &lt;- many $ escapedChars &lt;|&gt; noneOf &quot;\&quot;\\&quot;
                  char '&quot;'
                  return $ String x

=== Exercise 3 ===

 escapedChars :: Parser Char
 escapedChars = do char '\\' 
                   x &lt;- oneOf &quot;\\\&quot;nrt&quot; 
                   return $ case x of 
                     '\\' -&gt; x
                     '&quot;'  -&gt; x
                     'n'  -&gt; '\n'
                     'r'  -&gt; '\r'
                     't'  -&gt; '\t'

=== Exercise 4 ===

First, it is necessary to change the definition of symbol.

 symbol :: Parser Char
 symbol = oneOf &quot;!$%&amp;|*+-/:&lt;=&gt;?@^_~&quot;

This means that it is no longer possible to begin an atom with the hash character.  This necessitates a different way of parsing #t and #f.

 parseBool :: Parser LispVal
 parseBool = do
     char '#'
     (char 't' &gt;&gt; return (Bool True)) &lt;|&gt; (char 'f' &gt;&gt; return (Bool False))

This in turn requires us to make changes to parseExpr.

 parseExpr :: Parser LispVal
 parseExpr = parseAtom
         &lt;|&gt; parseString
         &lt;|&gt; parseNumber
         &lt;|&gt; parseBool


parseNumber need to be changed to the following.

 parseNumber :: Parser LispVal
 parseNumber = parseDigital1 &lt;|&gt; parseDigital2 &lt;|&gt; parseHex &lt;|&gt; parseOct &lt;|&gt; parseBin

And the following new functions need to be added.


 parseDigital1 :: Parser LispVal
 parseDigital1 = many1 digit &gt;&gt;= (return . Number . read)

 parseDigital2 :: Parser LispVal
 parseDigital2 = do try $ string &quot;#d&quot;
                    x &lt;- many1 digit
                    (return . Number . read) x

 parseHex :: Parser LispVal
 parseHex = do try $ string &quot;#x&quot;
               x &lt;- many1 hexDigit
               return $ Number (hex2dig x)

 parseOct :: Parser LispVal
 parseOct = do try $ string &quot;#o&quot;
               x &lt;- many1 octDigit
               return $ Number (oct2dig x)

 parseBin :: Parser LispVal
 parseBin = do try $ string &quot;#b&quot;
               x &lt;- many1 (oneOf &quot;10&quot;)
               return $ Number (bin2dig x)

 oct2dig x = fst $ readOct x !! 0
 hex2dig x = fst $ readHex x !! 0
 bin2dig  = bin2dig' 0
 bin2dig' digint &quot;&quot; = digint
 bin2dig' digint (x:xs) = let old = 2 * digint + (if x == '0' then 0 else 1) in
                          bin2dig' old xs

=== Exercise 5 ===

 data LispVal = Atom String
              | List [LispVal]
              | DottedList [LispVal] LispVal
              | Number Integer
              | String String
              | Bool Bool
              | Character Char

 parseCharacter :: Parser LispVal
 parseCharacter = do
  try $ string &quot;#\\&quot;
  value &lt;- try (string &quot;newline&quot; &lt;|&gt; string &quot;space&quot;) 
          &lt;|&gt; do { x &lt;- anyChar; notFollowedBy alphaNum ; return [x] }
   return $ Character $ case value of
     &quot;space&quot; -&gt; ' '
     &quot;newline&quot; -&gt; '\n'
     otherwise -&gt; (value !! 0)

The combination of anyChar and notFollowedBy ensure that only a single character is read.

Note that this does not actually conform to the standard;  as it stands, &quot;space&quot; and &quot;newline&quot; must be entirely lowercase;  the standard states that they should be case insensitive.


 parseExpr :: Parser LispVal
 parseExpr = parseAtom
         &lt;|&gt; parseString
         &lt;|&gt; try parseNumber -- we need the 'try' because 
         &lt;|&gt; try parseBool -- these can all start with the hash char
         &lt;|&gt; try parseCharacter

=== Exercise 6 ===

A possible solution for floating point numbers:

  parseFloat :: Parser LispVal
  parseFloat = do x &lt;- many1 digit
                  char '.'
                  y &lt;- many1 digit
                  return $ Float (fst.head$readFloat (x++&quot;.&quot;++y))
Furthermore, add 
  try parseFloat
''before'' parseNumber in parseExpr and the line
  | Float Double
to the LispVal type.

=== Exercise 7 ===

'''Ratio''', using Haskell's Ratio type:

  parseRatio :: Parser LispVal
  parseRatio = do x &lt;- many1 digit
                  char '/'
                  y &lt;- many1 digit
                  return $ Ratio ((read x) % (read y))

Additionally, import the ''Ratio'' module, add
  try parseRatio
''before'' parseNumber in parseExpr and the line
  | Ratio Rational
to the LispVal type.

'''Real''' is already implemented in the Float type from Exercise 6, unless I'm mistaken.

'''Complex''' using Haskell's Complex type:
  toDouble :: LispVal -&gt; Double
  toDouble(Float f) = f
  toDouble(Number n) = fromIntegral n

  parseComplex :: Parser LispVal
  parseComplex = do x &lt;- (try parseFloat &lt;|&gt; parseDecimal)
                    char '+' 
                    y &lt;- (try parseFloat &lt;|&gt; parseDecimal)
                    char 'i' 
                    return $ Complex (toDouble x :+ toDouble y)

As before, import the ''Complex'' module, add
  try parseComplex
''before'' parseNumber and parseFloat in parseExpr and the line
   | Complex (Complex Double)
to the LispVal type.

==Section 4 - Recursive Parsers: Adding lists, dotted lists, and quoted datums==

===Exercise 1===
These two are analogous to parseQuoted:
  parseQuasiQuoted :: Parser LispVal
  parseQuasiQuoted = do
      char '`'
      x &lt;- parseExpr
      return $ List [Atom &quot;quasiquote&quot;, x]

  parseUnQuote :: Parser LispVal
  parseUnQuote = do
      char ','
      x &lt;- parseExpr
      return $ List [Atom &quot;unquote&quot;, x]

Also add
        &lt;|&gt; parseQuasiQuoted
        &lt;|&gt; parseUnQuote
to parseExpr.

===Exercise 2===
I chose to go with Arrays as described in [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/array-0.3.0.0/Data-Array.html Data.Array] and used list-array conversions for array construction.
  parseVector :: Parser LispVal
  parseVector = do arrayValues &lt;- sepBy parseExpr spaces
                   return $ Vector (listArray (0,(length arrayValues - 1)) arrayValues)
In order to use this, import ''Data.Array'' and add the following to the LispVal type:
             | Vector (Array Int LispVal)
Add the following lines to parseExpr; ''before'' the parser for Lists and DottedLists.
        &lt;|&gt; try (do string &quot;#(&quot;
                    x &lt;- parseVector
                    char ')'
                    return x)

===Exercise 3===

This took a fair amount of fiddling with &lt;code&gt;sepBy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;endBy&lt;/code&gt; and friends. I started by getting the &lt;code&gt;(. degenerate)&lt;/code&gt; dotted list to work and then went from there. This code tolerates trailing and leading spaces.

 parseAnyList :: Parser LispVal
 parseAnyList = do
   P.char '('
   optionalSpaces
   head &lt;- P.sepEndBy parseExpr spaces
   tail &lt;- (P.char '.' &gt;&gt; spaces &gt;&gt; parseExpr) &lt;|&gt; return (Nil ())
   optionalSpaces
   P.char ')'
   return $ case tail of
     (Nil ()) -&gt; List head
     otherwise -&gt; DottedList head tail


Alternative solution without a Nil constructor. &lt;code&gt;spaces&lt;/code&gt; is the spaces from Parsec and &lt;code&gt;spaces1&lt;/code&gt; is the spaces from this tutorial.

 parseList :: Parser LispVal
 parseList = do char '(' &gt;&gt; spaces
                head &lt;- parseExpr `sepEndBy` spaces1
                do char '.' &gt;&gt; spaces1
                   tail &lt;- parseExpr
                   spaces &gt;&gt; char ')'
                   return $ DottedList head tail
                 &lt;|&gt; (spaces &gt;&gt; char ')' &gt;&gt; (return $ List head))

===Exercise 1===
Here is one way of adding a few of them.

 primitives :: [(String , [LispVal] -&gt; LispVal)]
 primitives = [(&quot;+&quot; , numericBinop (+)) ,
               (&quot;-&quot; , numericBinop (-)) ,
               (&quot;*&quot; , numericBinop (*)) ,
               (&quot;/&quot; , numericBinop div) ,
               (&quot;mod&quot; , numericBinop mod) ,
               (&quot;quotient&quot; , numericBinop quot) ,
               (&quot;remainder&quot; , numericBinop rem) ,
               (&quot;symbol?&quot; , unaryOp symbolp) ,
               (&quot;string?&quot; , unaryOp stringp) ,
               (&quot;number?&quot; , unaryOp numberp) ,
               (&quot;bool?&quot;, unaryOp boolp) ,
               (&quot;list?&quot; , unaryOp listp)]

 unaryOp :: (LispVal -&gt; LispVal) -&gt; [LispVal] -&gt; LispVal
 unaryOp f [v] = f v

 symbolp, numberp, stringp, boolp, listp :: LispVal -&gt; LispVal
 symbolp (Atom _)   = Bool True
 symbolp _          = Bool False
 numberp (Number _) = Bool True
 numberp _          = Bool False
 stringp (String _) = Bool True
 stringp _          = Bool False
 boolp   (Bool _)   = Bool True
 boolp   _          = Bool False
 listp   (List _)   = Bool True
 listp   (DottedList _ _) = Bool True
 listp   _          = Bool False

===Exercise 2===

 unpackNum :: LispVal -&gt; Integer
 unpackNum (Number n) = n
 unpackNum _          = 0

===Exercise 3===

Add symbol-&gt;string and string-&gt;symbol to the list of primitives, then:

 symbol2string, string2symbol :: LispVal -&gt; LispVal
 symbol2string (Atom s)   = String s
 symbol2string _          = String &quot;&quot;
 string2symbol (String s) = Atom s
 string2symbol _          = Atom &quot;&quot;

This doesn't deal well with bad input, which is covered later.

=Chapter 5=

===Exercise 1===

 eval env (List [Atom &quot;if&quot;, pred, conseq, alt]) = do 
    result &lt;- eval env pred
    case result of
      Bool False -&gt; eval env alt
      Bool True  -&gt; eval env conseq
      _          -&gt; throwError $ TypeMismatch &quot;bool&quot; pred

===Exercise 2===
Define a helper function that takes the equal/eqv function as an argument:

  eqvList :: ([LispVal] -&gt; ThrowsError LispVal) -&gt; [LispVal] -&gt; ThrowsError LispVal
  eqvList eqvFunc [(List arg1), (List arg2)] = return $ Bool $ (length arg1 == length arg2) &amp;&amp; 
                                                      (all eqvPair $ zip arg1 arg2)
        where eqvPair (x1, x2) = case eqvFunc [x1, x2] of
                                      Left err -&gt; False
                                      Right (Bool val) -&gt; val

Now adjust the eqv clause:

  eqv [l1@(List arg1), l2@(List arg2)] = eqvList eqv [l1, l2]

And add clauses for List and DottedList to the equal function:

  equal :: [LispVal] -&gt; ThrowsError LispVal
  equal [l1@(List arg1), l2@(List arg2)] = eqvList equal [l1, l2]
  equal [(DottedList xs x), (DottedList ys y)] = equal [List $ xs ++ [x], List $ ys ++ [y]]
  equal [arg1, arg2] = do
      primitiveEquals &lt;- liftM or $ mapM (unpackEquals arg1 arg2)
                         [AnyUnpacker unpackNum, AnyUnpacker unpackStr, AnyUnpacker unpackBool]
      eqvEquals &lt;- eqv [arg1, arg2]
      return $ Bool $ (primitiveEquals || let (Bool x) = eqvEquals in x)
  equal badArgList = throwError $ NumArgs 2 badArgList

===Exercise 3===

====cond====

Room for improvement here!

 eval (List ((Atom &quot;cond&quot;):cs))              = do 
   b &lt;- (liftM (take 1 . dropWhile f) $ mapM condClause cs) &gt;&gt;= cdr   
   car [b] &gt;&gt;= eval 
     where condClause (List [p,b]) = do q &lt;- eval p
                                        case q of
                                          Bool _ -&gt; return $ List [q,b]
                                          _      -&gt; throwError $ TypeMismatch &quot;bool&quot; q 
           condClause v            = throwError $ TypeMismatch &quot;(pred body)&quot; v 
           f                       = \(List [p,b]) -&gt; case p of 
                                                        (Bool False) -&gt; True
                                                        _            -&gt; False

Another approach:

 eval env (List (Atom &quot;cond&quot; : expr : rest)) = do
     eval' expr rest
     where eval' (List [cond, value]) (x : xs) = do
               result &lt;- eval env cond
               case result of
                    Bool False -&gt; eval' x xs
                    Bool True  -&gt; eval env value
                    otherwise  -&gt; throwError $ TypeMismatch &quot;boolean&quot; cond
           eval' (List [Atom &quot;else&quot;, value]) [] = do
                eval env value
           eval' (List [cond, value]) [] = do
               result &lt;- eval env cond
               case result of
                    Bool True  -&gt; eval env value
                    otherwise  -&gt; throwError $ TypeMismatch &quot;boolean&quot; cond

Yet another approach, piggy-backing off of the already-implemented if:

 eval form@(List (Atom &quot;cond&quot; : clauses)) =
   if null clauses
   then throwError $ BadSpecialForm &quot;no true clause in cond expression: &quot; form
   else case head clauses of
     List [Atom &quot;else&quot;, expr] -&gt; eval expr
     List [test, expr]        -&gt; eval $ List [Atom &quot;if&quot;,
                                              test,
                                              expr,
                                              List (Atom &quot;cond&quot; : tail clauses)]
     _ -&gt; throwError $ BadSpecialForm &quot;ill-formed cond expression: &quot; form


====case====

This solution requires LispVal to have a deriving (Eq) clause, in order to use the `elem` function.

 eval form@(List (Atom &quot;case&quot; : key : clauses)) =
   if null clauses
   then throwError $ BadSpecialForm &quot;no true clause in case expression: &quot; form
   else case head clauses of
     List (Atom &quot;else&quot; : exprs) -&gt; mapM eval exprs &gt;&gt;= return . last
     List ((List datums) : exprs) -&gt; do
       result &lt;- eval key
       equality &lt;- mapM (\x -&gt; eqv [result, x]) datums
       if Boolean True `elem` equality
         then mapM eval exprs &gt;&gt;= return . last
         else eval $ List (Atom &quot;case&quot; : key : tail clauses)
     _                     -&gt; throwError $ BadSpecialForm &quot;ill-formed case expression: &quot; form

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two main types of words in Uzbek: nominals and verbals. Nominals are those words wich are equivalent to English nouns and adjectives, or which have a noun-like character; for example, қora, &quot;black&quot; and kўз 'eye'.

In Uzbek, nominals include classes of words that in English are called nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and some adverbs. An Uzbek &quot;noun&quot; may be equivalent to an English adjective or noun:

қора kўзларим  ''My black eyes''

Verbals are those words which are equivalent to English verbs and some adverbs; for example, қелмоқ 'to come' (infinitive)and бўлиб ыыас, беінгыы (герёнд).

In addition, there are a small number of particles, conjunctions, and similar words which do not take suffixes; for example  учун ''for''and ва ''and''.

The last syllable of an Uzbek word receives the stress. however, certain endings and particles at the end of words are not stressed.

Don't let it scare you that all this grammatical stuff is supposed to be read before you begin. Really they are all really simple—and shouldn't be something you need to worry about. Also, remember: This will always be a handy reference. Just enjoy it!

To Editors: It might be a good idea to incorporate this section into the main lessons

==Nominal and Verbal Words==

There are two main types of words in Uzbek: nominals and verbals. Nominals are those words which are equivalent to English nouns and adjectives, or which have a noun-like character; for example, ''qora'', &quot;black&quot; and ''koʻz'' 'eye'.

In Uzbek, nominals include classes of words that in English are called nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and some adverbs. An Uzbek &quot;noun&quot; may be equivalent to an English adjective or noun:

'''qora koʻzlarim'''  (My black eyes...)&lt;br&gt;
'''Koʻzlarim qora'''  (My eyes are black)

Verbals are those words which are equivalent to English verbs and some adverbs; for example, ''qelmoq'' 'to come' (infinitive)and ''boʻlib'' 'as, being' (gerund).

In addition, there are a small number of particles, conjunctions, and similar words which do not take suffixes; for example  ''uchun'' 'for' and ''va'' 'and'.

The last syllable of an Uzbek word receives the stress. however, certain endings and particles at the end of words are not stressed.

==Suffixation==
The lexical meanings and grammatical functions of Uzbek words are indicated primarily by adding elements called suffixes to the ends of the words. This process of suffixation (also called agglutation) is regular and clear in the sense that it does not require changing the phonetic shapes of words and suffixes; fo example,

'''koʻzlarim'''  (eye+s+my = my eyes)

==Word Formation Suffixes==
Nominals and verbals with new lexical meanings are created in Uzbek through suffixation. Adding a suffix to a nominal root or word results in a nominal or a verbal with a new lexical meaning:

'''bosh''' (head - ''anatomy'')&lt;br&gt;
'''boshliq''' (chief, foreman)&lt;br&gt;
'''boshlamoq''' (to begin -''infinitive'')

Adding a new suffix to a verbal root or word also produces a nominal or a verbal with a new lexical meaning:

'''boshlanmoq''' (to be begun -''infinitive'')&lt;br&gt;
'''boshlangʻich''' (beginning, elementary)

==Grammatical Suffixes==
The indication of grammatical functions like number, case, mood or tense is accomplished by adding suffixes to words. These grammatical suffixes change the relationship of one word to other words in a sentence; however, they do not change the basic lexical meaning of the word.
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
''Lexical''
:'''uy'''   (home)
:'''uylimoq''' (to marry)
:'''uylanmoq''' (to get married)
{{col-2}}
''Grammatical''
:'''uyda''' (at home)
:'''uyga keldi''' (he came home)
:'''uylandi''' (he got married)
{{col-end}}

==Plural Suffix==
The Uzbek suffix plural -lar is added to nominals to indicate that there is more than one subject or object, but also to verbals to indicate that there is more than one subject. After numeral, the plural suffix is not added to a nominal:

'''qiz''' (daughter)&lt;br&gt;
'''qizlar''' (daughters)&lt;br&gt;
'''uch qiz''' (three daughters)&lt;br&gt;
'''keldi''' (he came)&lt;br&gt;
'''keldilar''' (they came)

==Case Suffixes==
Case suffixes express relationships between nominals and verbals and are equivalent to English 'to', 'in', 'from', and other ideas:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
:'''oʻgʻil''' (son)
:'''xalq''' (people)
:'''kitob''' (book)
{{col-2}}
:'''oʻgʻilga''' (to the son)
:'''xalqdan''' (from the people)
:'''kitobda''' (in the book)
{{col-end}}

==Possession Suffixes==
Uzbek has several means of expressing possession. One means requires adding possessive suffixes to a nominal:
&lt;br&gt;
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
:'''kitobim''' (my book)
:'''kitobing''' (your book - singular)
{{col-2}}
:'''kitobimiz''' (our book)
:'''kitobingiz''' (your book - plural)
{{col-end}}
A second means requires the possessive relationship construction. In Uzbek, the possessor of an object is placed first, often with the suffix ''-ning'', while the person or the object possessed is placed second, always with the suffix ''-i/si'' (plural ''-lari''). The Uzbek equivalent of an English phrase like 'my daughter's book' is the following:
'''qizimning kitobi'''&lt;br&gt;''daughter+my+of book+her''&lt;br&gt;(my daughters book)

==Infinitive Suffix==
The Uzbek equivalent of the English infinitive of verbs ('to enter,' 'to see,' etc.) is created by adding the suffix ''-moq'' to the verbal root. Without this or other suffixes, the verbal root expresses the familiar or at times impolite imperative mood:

'''kirmoq''' (to enter ''-infinitive'')&lt;br&gt;
'''kir!''' (enter! -''singular, familiar, impolite)

==Mood Suffixes==
To express moods like the imperative or the conditional, Uzbek adds suffixes to verbal roots:

'''kiring!''' (come in ''-singular, familiar, polite'')&lt;br&gt;
'''kirsa''' (if he enters)

==Tense Suffixes==
In Uzbek, tenses like past, present, and future are formed by adding suffixes to a verbal root, including the past tense suffix ''-di'':

'''kelmoq''' (to come -infinitive)&lt;br&gt;
'''keldi''' (he came)

Uzbek combines the meanings of English present and future tenses into one idea that is expressed by the suffix ''-a/-y''. This present-future tense indicates that an action occurs as a habit in the present and may occur at some point in the future:

'''oʻqimoq''' (to read ''-infinitive'')&lt;br&gt;
'''oʻqiydi''' (he reads ''(as a habit)'', he will read ''(tomorrow)'')

==Articles==
Uzbek lacks words equivalent to the English articles 'a/an, the'. Instead, a nominal serving as an object of a verb stands without a suffix to express an indefinite quality, while a nominal severing as an object adds the suffix ''-ni'' to indicate a definite quality.

'''kitob oʻqiydi''' (he reads books—indefinite number)&lt;br&gt;
'''kitobni oʻqiydi''' (he will read the book—definite)

==Personal Pronouns==
In Uzbek, both singular and plural forms exist for personal pronouns. Besides the first person pronoun ''men'' (I) and ''biz'' (we), Uzbek has the pronoun ''sen'' for singular 'you' (older English 'thou') and the pronoun ''siz'' for singular polite and plural 'you'.

Uzbek does not posses separate personal pronouns for 'he', 'she', and 'it.' All of these persons are expressed with the pronoun ''u''. Gender must be determined from other words in the sentence or context.

==Postpositions==
Where English places words like 'behind' or 'toward' in position before nouns (prepositions), Uzbek uses nominals with the same meanings in position after other nominals (postpositions):

'''uy orqasida''' (behind the house)&lt;br&gt;
'''uy tomonida''' (toward the house)

==Relative Sentences==
The formation of relative sentences presents a major difficulty for learners of Uzbek. In English, the word 'who' in the construction 'the sone who entered the house' is expressed by adding the suffix ''-gan'' to a verbal root and by reversing the order of elements:

'''Uyga kirgan oʻgʻil'''&lt;br&gt;
'house+into enter+who son'&lt;br&gt;
(The son who entered the house)

==Complex Sentences==
Spoken Uzbek makes little use of the conjunction ''va'' (and) to link two sentences together. The 'and' in the English sentence 'he came home and read the book' is indicated by adding the suffix ''-ib'' to the first verbal stem:

'''U uyga kelib, kitobni oʻqidi'''&lt;br&gt;
(He came home and read the book)

==Word Order==
The word order in Uzbek sentences normally has the following construction:

''Subject + object + predicate''&lt;br&gt;
'''U kitobni oʻqidi'''&lt;br&gt;
He +  book + the  + read + he = (He read the book.)

==Grammar and Vocabulary Explanations==
===For Dialogue 1===
The comparative degree of adjectives is formed by adding the suffix ''-roq'' to the stem of an adjective:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|||0|2|}}
|-
| issiq+roq &gt; issiqroq
| warmer
|-
| sovuq+roq &gt; sovuqroq
| colder
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The superlative degree of adjectives is formed by placing the word ''eng'' (most, very) before an adjective. Sometimes, especially in spoken Uzbek, the word ''juda'' (very, too) is used instead of ''eng'':

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|||0|2|}}
|-
| juda shirin = eng shirin
| sweetest
|-
| juda qimmat = eng qimmat
| most expensive
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;
Another funcion of the particle ''-chi'' is to form a question meaning 'what about?' In this meaning the particle may be added to one word noun predicates:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|||0|2|}}
|-
| nok-chi?
| what about the pears?
|-
| kelmasa-chi
| What if he, she does not come?
|-
|}

===For Dialogue 2===
The words ''xola'' and ''bolam'' are forms of address. ''Xola'' (aunt) is used by younger people to address unknown older woman and the word ''bolam'' (my child) is used by older men and women to address younger people:

{| {{Uzbek table|Example|||0|2||}}
|-
| Rozimisiz, xola?
| Do you agree, aunt?
|-
| Mayli, bolam.
| All right, my child
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
When the irregular verb form ''ekan'' is used as a component of a noun predicate, it may be translated 'seem,' 'seems,' 'after all,' 'apparently'. The predicative suffixes ''-man'', ''-san''; ''-miz'', ''-siz'', ''-lar'' may be added directly to the irregular form ''ekan''.

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Pronouns (Possessive)||0|4|}}
|-
|Men sog’ ekanman
|I seem to be healthy
|-
|Sen sog’ ekansan
|You seem to be healthy.
|-
|U sog’ ekan
|He, she, seems to be healthy
|-
|Biz sog’ ekanmiz
|We seem to be healthy
|-
|Siz sog’ ekansiz
|You seem to be healthy
|-
|Ular sog’ ekanlar
|They seem to be healthy
|-
|Siz mehmon ekansiz
|After all, you are a guest.
|-
|}
====Pronunciation Note====
The compound verb ''bera qoling'' consists of the present gerund ''bera'' (giving) and the auxiliary verb ''qoling'' (to stay). The first verb in the compound carries the primary meaning, while ''qolmoq'' adds the meaning of permission or a request. When ''qolmoq'' expresses a request, the vowel in the second syllable is pronounced longer:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Pronouns (Possessive)||0|4|}}
|-
|Siz bir yuz yigirma so’m bera qoling.
|You may pay 120 som (permission)
|-
|Menga kitobingizni bera qoling.
|Please give me your book (request)
|-
|}

===For Dialogue 3===
The construction ''-moqchi edi'' expresses desire and may be translated 'would like to':

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Plural suffix (-lar)||0|2|}}
|-
|Men mana bu ko’ylakni ko’rmoqchi edim
|I would like to see this shirt
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;
In this construction, the predicative suffixes ''-m'', ''-ng''; ''-k'', ''-ngyz,'' ''-lar'' are added to the irregular verb from of ''edi:''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Question Particle Example||0|2|}}
|-
| men ko’rmoqchi edim
| I would like to see
|-
| sen ko’rmoqchi edingiz
| you would like to see
|-
| u ko’rmoqchi edi
| he, she would like to see
|-
| biz ko’rmoqchi edik
| we would like to see
|-
| siz ko’rmoqchi edingiz
| you would like to see
|-
| ular ko’rmoqchi edilar
| they would like to see
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
To express the idea of 'like to,' the dative suffix ''-ga'' is added to personal pronouns before the verb form ''yoqadi:''

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Question Particle Example||0|2|}}
|-
| menga yoqadi
| I like
|-
| senga yoqadi
| you like
|-
| unga yoqadi
| he, she likes
|-
| bizga yoqadi
| we like
|-
| sizga yokadi
| you like
|-
| ularga yokadi
| they like
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The phrase ''menga mos'' (it fits me) has the same structure as ''menga yoqadi''.

==Uzbek Proverb==
{| {{Uzbek table|Proverb|||0|2|}} 
|[[image:Cquote1.svg‎]]Shirin yolg’ondan achchiq haqiqat yaxshi.[[image:Cquote2.svg‎]]
|-
|Translation: The bitter truth is better than a sweet lie.
|-
|}

[[Image:UzbekNon.jpg|300px|Uzbek Lady selling Non|thumb|right|A Uzbek lady in Samarkland selling non.]]

==Cultural Notes==
Because the Silk Road once passed through the territory of present-day Uzbekistan, Uzbek food reflects influences of the cuisines of Chinese, Indians, and other Asian and European peoples.

Uzbeks usually eat three meals a day. In the morning, along with their traditional bread called ''non'', they drink tea and milk. Summer breakfasts also often include grapes. Uzbeks in rural areas almost never buy bread from a store, but rather bake their own bread daily in a special oven called a ''tandir''. Most rural families also have their own cows which provide milk.

Uzbeks tend to eat lunch in the early afternoon. At this time they like to have such soups as ''sho'rva'' (meat and potatoes), ''mastava'' (rice, meat, and vegetables), or ''lag'mon'' (noodles, meat, and vegetables).

The main meal, usually a food other than soup, is eaten in the evening, around seven or eight o'clock. During the warm months, Uzbeks like to have ''qovun'' (melon) for dessert.

Tea by far is the most popular beverage. People in Tashkent and a few other cities tend to drink black tea, while in rural areas and cities in the south and in Ferghana Valley they prefer green tea. Tea is always served hot.

Cities and villages have many teahouses where people eat, relax, and socialize. Uzbeks believe that tea is the only thing that can quench thirst in their hot climate. Coffee is not very popular.

Uzbeks rarely eat their meals in restaurants. One reason for this is the high cost of dining out, but a more important reason is that home cooking almost always is better than that in restaurants. Men and women alike take part in food preparation, and it is popularly believed that men make the best chefs.

[[Image:Plov.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Plov]]
Pilav is a favourite food that is always served at major celebrations. On these occasions it is prepared in huge metal cooking pots over a fire.

An essential part of Uzbek hospitality is to offer food to visitors. Even when they themselves have very little, Uzbeks try to prepare elaborate meals for their guests. Guests may disappoint their hosts when they fail to eat or drink what they are offered.

While tables and chairs are used in many city homes, in rural areas Uzbeks sit on the floor around a large ''dasturxon'' (tablecloth) to take their meals. Utensils such as spoons are used for soups, but for other dishes, like pilav, fingers may be used.

Alcoholic beverages are served on special occasions and when guests are present. At such times, males are expected to join in the drinking.

The greeting ''Assalomu Alaykum''! is a very common expression throughout the Muslim world, among Uzbeks it is especially common in the more conservative rural areas. It is from an Arabic greeting meaning ''peace be upon you!'' The invariable response must be ''Vaalaykum Assalom!'' which is also from an Arabic greeting meaning ''I also wish you peace!''

Uzbeks also have other greetings used for different times of day. The most appropriate response for any of these greetings is to repeat the greeting.

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Forms of Greeting||0|3|}}
|-
| Xayrli erta!
| Good Morning!
|-
| Xayrli kun!
| Good Afternoon!
|-
| Xayrli oqshom!
| Good Evening!
|-
| Xayrli kech!
| Good Night!
|-
| Yaxshimisiz!
| How are you?
|-
| Omonmisiz!
| How are you?
|-
| Esonmisiz!
| How are you?
|-
| Salom!
| Hello
|-
|}

Omonmisiz! is mostly used by woman.

===For Dialogue 2===
From Previoius Lessons:

Standard Uzbek has both singular and plural pronouns:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Pronouns||0|4||}}
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|'''Plural'''
|
|-
| men
| I
| biz
| we
|-
| sen
| you
| siz
| you
|-
| u
| he, she, it
| ular
| they
|-
|}

The second person pronoun ''sen'' is used to address one or more friends and equals or those who are younger or familiar. ''Siz'' must be used to address those who are older or unfamiliar, and also to address more than one person.

The third person pronoun у can refer to males, females, or things. Gender can be determined from context.

''Mening'' ('my') is a possessive form of the personal pronoun ''men''. The singular and plural possessive forms of the personal pronouns are:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Pronouns (Possessive)||0|4|}}
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|'''Plural'''
|
|-
| mening
| my
| bizning
| our
|-
| sening
| your
| sizning
| your
|-
| uning
| his, her, its
| ularning
| their
|-
|}

The possessive forms of the personal pronouns can be omitted when a noun already reflects possession.

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Example||0|3|}}
|-
|Mening ismim - Erkin.
|'My name+my is Erkin'
|-
|Ismim - Erkin
|'Name+my is Erkin'
|-
|}

The suffix ''-man'' 'I am', expresses person and is a noun predicate. The singular and plural noun suffixes in standard Uzbek are:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Noun Suffixes||0|4|}}
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|'''Plural'''
|
|-
| -man
| 'I am'
| -miz
| 'we are'
|-
| -san
| 'you are'
| -siz
| 'you are'
|-
| (no suffix)
| he, she, it is
| -lar
| they are
|-
|}

The subject pronoun may be omitted in a sentence where one of these predicate suffixes are used.

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Example||0|3| |}}
|-
| Men o’qituvchiman.
| O’qituvchiman.
|-
|'I (am a) teacher+I am'
|'Teacher+I am'
|}

===For Dialogue 3===
The plural suffix is -lar. It is added to the stem of the noun:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Plural suffix (-lar)||0|4|}}
|-
|'''Singular'''
|
|'''Plural'''
|
|-
| talaba
| student
| talabalar
| students
|-
| ish
| work
| ishlar
| works
|-
|}

When the Uzbeks ask someone about his well-being they usually use expressions like ''Ishlaringiz qanday?'' (How are you?), ''Ishlaringiz yaxshimi?'' (How are things?). The response may be ''Yaxshi'' (Good), ''Ishlarim Yaxshi'' (Everything is fine), or ''Rahmat'' (Thanks).

The question particle is ''-mi''. In order to form an interrogative sentence this particle is addded only to the predicate of a sentence:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Question Particle Example||0|2|}}
|-
| U talabami?
| Is he a student?
|-
|}
====Pronunciation====
Questions formed with the help of the particle -mi are pronounced with a rising intonation. In the sentence ''Ishlaringiz yaxshimi?'' (How are things?), the peak of intonation is on the second syllable of ''yaxshi''.

Questions formed with the help of the interrogative words like ''qanday'' (how) are pronounced with falling intonation. In the sentence ''Ishlaringiz qanday?'' (How are you?), the low point of intonation is on the second syllable of ''qanday''.

===For Dialogue 4===
As Uzbeks take leave of one another, they commonly exchange a series of expressions meaning goodbye. Some of these are:

{| {{Uzbek table|Dialogue|Forms of Greeting||0|3|}}
|-
| Xayr!
| Goodbye!
|-
| Xayr, Yaxshi boring!
| Goodbye, go in peace!
|-
| Ko’rishguncha!
| See you later!
|-
| Uchrashguncha!
| Meet you later!
|-
| Ertag’acha
| Until Tomorrow
|-
| Tuningiz xayrli bo’lsin!
| Good night!
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The parting expression ''Xayr!'' may be used at any time of day. The expression ''Xayr, yaxshi qoling! is used by a guest or by the person taking leave. The expression ''Xayr, yakshi boring!'' is used by a host or by the person staying.

The Uzbek word ''ko’p'' has many meanings, including 'fine,' 'very well,' 'agreed,' 'all right,' and 'O.K.' Uzbeks use ''ko’p'' and ''yakshi'' much as English speakers use 'fine', and 'good'.

For over sixty years Uzbek has been written in a modified Cyrillic alphabet. Since 1992 however the Uzbekistan government has made many attempts to switch over to the Latin script. This is the alphabet they decided on in 1995. This is an official script, but at the moment its not the only official script, they are keeping both scrips in use, forever pushing off the date to completely phase out Cyrillic. For your reference I've added a chart showing what letters represent what in the bottom of this page, however we'll only use the new alphabet in our lessons.

* Only at the beginning of the words

At the beginning of the words Cyrillic letter ''Ее'' corresponds to the Latin combination ''Ye ye'', elsewhere it corresponds to a Latin letter ''Ee''.
Letter ''Ээ'' is used for Latin ''Ee'' in the beginning of the word, and doesn't occur in the middle of words. Examples:
* еди - yedi
* эди - edi
* мен - men

The general rule doesn't apply to Russian loanwords, where letter ''э'' can appear in the middle of the word:
* поэма - poema

Letter ''Ьь'' (soft sign) doesn't represent any sound (and it doesn't mark palatisation, like it does in Slavic languages). It is used only in Russian loanwords, and has no corresponding letter in the Latin script:
* калькулятор - kalkulator
* календарь - kalendar
* панель - panel
* лагерь - lager
When suffixes are added to a word, final ''Ьь'' is dropped:
* календарь + лар = календарлар (kalendar + lar = kalendarlar)
* панель + ли = панелли (panel + li = panelli)

Letter ''Ъъ'' (hard sign) generally corresponds to apostrophe in Latin, but sometimes it is used before a yotified vowel in Russian loanwords; then it means nothing and is omitted in Latin:
адъютант - adyutant

* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

== Mongolian ==

Thanks for your offer. :)  I am willing to make a commitment to improving knowledge on Wikibooks, but One question: Do I have to already understand Mongolian?  Because I don't know any Mongolian yet.  I can write Cyrillic though, and putting in the extra 2 Mongol Cyrillic letters wouldn't be that hard.--[[User:68.54.253.180|68.54.253.180]] 17:23, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks a lot! I would love to be able to do this myself, but I don't even really have enough time for the Uzbek book. You won't need any knowledge of Mongolian to begin working :) I think all you need to do is type in the stuff from the peace corps book.--hopefully you can learn some as you go along. If it's needed I can try and help with the formatting...but you don't need formatting to start. I'm not really happy with the template I'm using in the Uzbek book, so I might change it to be more like the German one or something like that. 

:All the following stuffs are in the Public Domain.

:Anyways, the first step is typing in this first pdf:
:*[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/e/e9/Mongolcompetencies93.pdf Amraa et. al. - Mongol Language Competencies for Peace Corps (1993)]PDF

:Here is a beginning of a book another person was working on that I did some stuff for too, if you want you can take a look at it, and incorporate whatever you please. It's only beginning stages.

:Optional for incorporation also is:

:Hopefully these recourses are useful to you, and hopefully the Mongolian project is a great success. If I can help with anything let me know!--[[User:Uzbekscholar|Uzbekscholar]] 05:17, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

Hi, I'm sorry I haven't replied for all this time, I haven't had much time, sorry!  Anyway, your links don't contain any information about Mongolian.--[[User:68.54.253.180|68.54.253.180]] 15:58, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

::Hmm, I knew my old server was a bit of a mess, but I didn't realize that pdf's were a problem too. Sorry about that! Anyways, I've updloaded the stuff to the Wikibooks server, and double checked to make sure they were working. Hopefully you have fun working with it! If I can be of any help please let me know!--[[User:Uzbekscholar|Uzbekscholar]] 21:04, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

== Hi! ==

I recently found out about the creation of a Mongolian Wikibook. I just want to say that support your efforts in creating a Turkic Wikibook. Unfortunately I cannot help because I do not speak any Turkic languages other than [[Turkish]]. I, for one, am proud of my Turkic heritage, and I'm thirsty for more knowledge on it.

I've made requests for more Turkic language Wikibooks to be made [[Wikibooks:Requested books#Languages bookshelf#Altaic|here]], including [[Uyghur]], [[Tatar]], and [[Turkmen]]. At the moment, though, only [[Uzbek]], [[Azerbaijani]], [[Mongolian]] and [[Turkish]] exist, the two in the middle particularly needing work. Please help promote the cause.

It's great to be educating Turkic languages to the world, and sharing our culture with them.

That's all I'd like to say. Thank you.

== Images with non-commercial use licenses ==

G'day, I see that you've uploaded some Uzbek-related images that are under non-commercial use licenses. 
*[[:Image:UzbekPlov.jpg]]
*[[:Image:Uzbekboys.jpg]]
*[[:Image:Uzbekistan Architecture.jpg]]
Unfortunately, Wikibooks does not accept images that preclude commercial use - see [[Wikibooks:Image use policy#Acceptable licenses]]. Please replace these images with free images if possible. 
Also, [[:Image:UzbekNon.jpg]] doesn't specify its source - could you supply a link please? Thanks, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:47, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

:Thanks, mate. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:21, 3 July 2007 (UTC)

== Uzbek images on Commons ==

G'day Uzbekscholar, you may be interested to know about the Uzbek images on the Wiki Commons: [[Commons:Category:Uzbekistan]]. In particular, note all the sub-categories, where you will find the images. You can drop these images into your book just like any Wikibooks image; the Wiki software knows to go looking on the Commons if it doesn't find the image in the Wikibooks Images. cheers, [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:41, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

== your .pdf upload(s) ==

Please consider Wikisource as a place to upload documents such as [[:Image:PeaceCorpsUzbek.pdf]]. Such uploads will be deleted soon; please move them to a better home quickly. Thanks! ''' &amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:03, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

== [[Mongolian]] ==

I've rolled back your edits to the last version, where I added categories to the book. There is not &quot;no content&quot; on the page as it stands now. There is meta-content, which would better be used to create content rather than deleting it. Every book has to start somewhere, and deleting the plan which has been created there would not be helpful. Please consider contributing to the book rather than asking to have it deleted. If you still feel that it should be deleted, please nominate it at [[WB:VFD]]. (copied to [[Talk:Mongolian]]) '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:02, 15 October 2007 (UTC)

== [[Mongolian]] ==

Please do not replace the {{tlx|PDBook}} template on this book. It will be deleted shortly since it is inappropriate to require editors to release their contributions into the Public Domain - that would be contrary to the copyleft philosophy here. Please direct any further questions to [[WB:AA#Is this allowed?]], where discussion of this issue took place. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:47, 3 November 2007 (UTC)
:I notice that you recreated the template after it's first deletion. Please do not recreate it again (including under a different name); if you do, it would likely be protected from recreation. Repeated creation of speedily deleted content is considered disruptive. Thanks. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:56, 3 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Latin%2FLesson_12&amp;diff=819081&amp;oldid=710141] Do you use copy and past?

== Habermas Commentary/Topics ==

[[Habermas Commentary/Topics]] is stubby because it is list of topics in the fledgling [[Habermas Commentary]]. I'm not sure it deserves a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{qr-em}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I prematurely removed it, but then reinstated it because I don't want to create a culture of reversions / (in an extreme) edit wars. Sorry... :( --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:24, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

== Signatures ==

Hey Herby, you seem to be in touch with all the technical stuff (since you told me about the monobook stuff) so I figured I'd ask you, how did you change your signature? I'd like to change mine so that it includes a link to my talk page, nothing fancy, just maybe a (talk) link or something of that sort. I like how you set yours up too, it's always fascinating to me how people personalize their pages and such. Good luck and regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 18:50, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

== Cross wiki vandals ==

I think it's logical to block IP's which are blocked for long time on Wikipedia. Wikipedia admins don't make long lasting blocks if they are not sure they are blocking the right person. We don't risk much blocking such IP's here. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:46, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

==NoEditSection?==

Hi Herby,

Just wondering, what does the &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOEDITSECTION__&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag do when inserted into the header of a page? [[User:Urbane User|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urbane User&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane_User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:15, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

==Hello again==
Hello! You gave me a welcome message some time ago. (I was impressed to receive that on my first edit!) I was hoping you could offer me some advice, as it has not seemed to be forthcoming in other ways. I was planning to make a storyline study (very similar to your [[:Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]]) of some various works of fiction. Unfortunately, it seems that if a fictional work ever included a video game, it is considered a &quot;game guide&quot;. I actually intend such a work in the vein more of the Harry Potter and Half-Life books here. However, one of your admins here on the admin's noticeboard indicated that such an effort would be deleted on sight. I'm really not sure what content policy such a thing would violate here, as not only are similar works here, but the policies seem to explicitly permit such things. Certainly, studies of a work's plot and Cliff's Notes are in use in many classes the world over, and that seems to be the primary criterion! I was hoping you could offer some clarity on this, or maybe point me to some policy I missed? Thanks! [[User:Seraphimblade|Seraphimblade]] 03:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

== Foucault Handbook on hold ==

Hi Herbythyme,

Family circumstances require that I put the Foucault handbook on hold indefinitely. If you wish to remove it, you may go ahead and do so--I've archived my work.

== VFD ==

No worries.  I thought maybe you were basing it on votes and had miscounted.  I agree that the arguements are more important than votes but some people won't voice their arguement if they simply agree that it's crap or agree with the nomination.  The better arguements will usually come from those who disagree with the proposal because they have the 'most to lose'.  I've no problem with your decision.

no problem with the edits, I'll see what I can do with the rest of it, I think my lack of experience with that sort of thing may be an advantage because I'll have to look elsewhere for information... not today though!

== Copyright  ==

&quot;Hi - the recipes that you have added all look as though they come from a website ([1]) which has a copyright statement at the bottom of each page. If that is the case these will all have to be deleted as we cannot accept copyright materials here. Thanks --Herby talk thyme 16:58, 22 March 2007 (UTC)&quot;

Hi Herby,

Thanks for your comments about the copyright infringement, however i have permission from the Videojug website to use the content on their pages. I was actually told by a Wikipedia administrator (i know you're not totally associated with them!) that i could add pages to this website. The videojug website is actually a free resource for your users if they wish to get redirected to our website. Can you please let me know if adding material to your website is still ok. I believe that my content is valuable to the visitors at Wikibooks- so i really would like it to stay on your pages. Please can you reply as to the next stages, as i would like to add some more material (sparsely) but obviously it is quite time consuming! Thanks for the warning. Robert

''Thanks for the message - as far as I am aware without specific written permission from the owners of the website t the Wikimedia foundation it would not be possible to host these pages as they are absolute copies. Please look at Wikibooks:Copyrights and then maybe Help:Boilerplate request for permission. I would also like a pointer to where you were given permission on Wikipedia to use the material and the admin's name - copyright policy is the same across all Wikimedia projects. Thanks --Herby talk thyme 09:48, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

I actually work for the organisation concerned, so i do have written permission from the website owner (in fact he is about five metres from me). If you would like me to change a few of these pages so they aren't absolute copies i can do that. The following extract came from Kariteh in the Wikipedia team. Hope that this is acceptable, and we can continue with this.

&quot;This is the reason why the sister project Wikibooks has been created. Wikibooks is a collection of free &quot;books&quot; and annotated texts that are written collaboratively by anyone. While tutorials, guides, recipes, how-tos, etc. do not belong on Wikipedia, they are definively at home on Wikibooks. When people want to look for encyclopedic contents, they look here; when they look for how-tos, they look on Wikibooks. So you might want to check that project; there are a lot of other recipes there and yours would definitively be welcome. As a matter of fact, contents which are inapropriate for Wikipedia can often be moved to Wikibooks instead of being simply deleted or reverted&quot;. &quot;So, as a conclusion, I hope you understand Wikipedia's reasonings and guidelines better now. Again, while recipes are not appropriate for an encyclopedia, they definitely are for Wikipedia's sister project Wikibooks&quot;. Kariteh 18:36, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

Ok- Thanks for your help on this matter. I won't add any more content to your pages until a decision has been made. However i would like to add that any external link coming from your site is predominantly promoting some product i.e. taking you away from your site to theirs/ another. We also do not sell any products on our site! I hope that an agreement can be reached. Thanks again for understanding and trying to get to the bottom of it before deleting the appropriate content. Hope we can resolve this soon.

:Hope I'm not intruding here... In the US, apparently, recipes are deemed facts and thus are not copyrightable. I can get the reference if you need it. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:00, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

::I'll happily intrude also! US law does allow a list of ingredients, but a recipe is generally more than that.

== uk.d-i-y links ==

Thanks for intro and feedback on [[User talk:John Stumbles|my talk page]]. I've now added uk.d-i-y links to 
[[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf#External how-to sites]] which seems to be the correct place for such links, if they are useful (which I think they are). I was going to put them there first time around but didn't seem able to edit that page then, though I can now. Ho hum! --[[User:John Stumbles|John Stumbles]] 23:47, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:Sorry but such [external] links really are not appropriate to Wikibooks. As I said above the idea is to create &quot;stand alone&quot; textbook content. Thanks --Herby talk thyme 07:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

:: Then what about the other external links in the '''External how-to sites''' from which you've just deleted the links I added? They're to external sites such as [http://www.ehow.com/ www.ehow.com/] and [http://www.instructables.com/howtoons/ www.instructables.com/howtoons/] (which carry commercial advertsing payloads). Are they appropriate? And if not why have the ''External how-to sites'' section at all? I'd appreciate some clarification here. --[[User:John Stumbles|John Stumbles]] 07:40, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

You replied:

    Ok -
  
       1. The link that you were placing is to a forum. I am not aware that of other pages with links to forums. These are such transient sites in terms of content that they will rarely be that relevant.
       2. The site is uk specific while Wikibooks is worldwide. If we allowed links to all such such from all around the world there would be nothing but links.
  
    Thanks --Herby talk thyme 10:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

: Thanks for the response. With respect to point 1 the links I placed were to 
# a conventional website [http://diyfaq.org.uk/ diyfaq.org.uk] 
# a wiki website [http://wiki.diyfaq.org.uk wiki.diyfaq.org.uk] and 
# google groups' interface to the uk.d-i-y '''usenet''' group [http://groups.google.co.uk/group/uk.d-i-y/topics] (not '''forum!''' - contributors to the group who use that term get mildly flamed for doing so!). 
: All 3 (not 2) links work for me - which did not do so for you?. Whilst the content of the google page varies constantly, google's archive retains past articles so a search for, say, [http://groups.google.co.uk/group/uk.d-i-y/search?group=uk.d-i-y&amp;q=solar+water+heat&amp;qt_g=Search+this+group solar water heating] brings up a mass of information which isn't even a red link in the [[Do-It-Yourself]] Wikibook.

: On point 2 obviously the site''s'' are UK-centric (although the principles of many topics are relevant to many other parts of the world). Is this a problem? I note that the entire [[Automobile Repair]] chapter in the [[Do-It-Yourself]] Wikibook, including one of the few articles which is not either a red link or a stub - [[Automobile Repair/99 mercury cougar alternator replacement]] - is highly US-centric. Is that OK but UK-centric is not?

: --[[User:John Stumbles|John Stumbles]] 12:42, 29 March 2007 (UTC)


''OK - I really am not prepared to enter into an argument with you. I will happily consult other admins/the community to see if they agree.''
:Fair enough

''The ability to &quot;find&quot; google groups is not really something that is that hard.''
: Agreed: google will easily enough find groups about widgets or whatever. Finding groups with good signal-to-noise ratios can be a bit harder though: that's where I, personally, find pointers &amp; &quot;heads up&quot;s helpful.

''In practice I think the [1] is really quite a useful link (and as it in turn links to google groups that again makes that link redundant) and probably should be in somewhere (I assume there will be a link back to Wikibooks placed there?)''
:There already is, and has been (to the [[Do-It-Yourself]] Wikibook) since the time I placed the first link in [[Do-It-Yourself#Guides in other wiki]]. Mind if I reinsert a link to the uk-di-y wiki then? And the FAQ (although that's also linked from the wiki).

''That you consider some article US centric is correct but they do not have links in and the answer of course in a Wiki is feel free to add UK relevant text. Content is required not links.''
: I have considered contributing to the wikibook, and would have done if I'd been aware of it before we set up the uk.d-i-y wiki. However I've now put a lot of work into our own wiki and don't want to abandon it, and copying content to another wiki 'forks' effort which I've cautioned against in our own wiki. Ours has a significantly different culture from wikibooks anyway with quite an acceptance of external links where they seem (to us) appropriate. OTOH Wikibooks obviously has a lot better backing than us in the shape of the wikimedia foundation so I'm watching withy interest to see how [[Do-It-Yourself]] develops, and will strongly suggest pooling effort if it seems appropriate when &amp; if the wikibook gets well established

== De-Adminship ==

We discussed the idea at length [[Wikibooks talk:Administrators#Inactivity|here]] but most of the useful content is really built into the policy itself [[WB:ADMIN#Removing_an_Administrator.2FBureaucrat|here]] and [[WB:ADMIN#Expectations|here]]. The policy came about largely because we had a ton of admins here that were given the status for no real reason, just that they were here at the beginning and I guess people figured they might need the tools at some point. In the large first round of de-adminships there were numerous users who had been absent for two years or so in most cases and had never even used the tools (as what was logged). Since these users had been gone for so long the community here found it unsafe that they still have these powerful features when they most likely have little to no concept of our policies here. The idea is that if you've been gone for a year and have done little to no editing since then (and we're pretty easy-going about this, something around 20 edits a year keeps you from losing the rights), you shouldn't have the tools since you can't be as trusted with enforcing proper procedure. Also, if new users see you listed as an admin they might try to contact you and receive no response, a discouraging event at the least if not dangerous should some vandalism or something else occur.

Most admins either had no response or were just &quot;whatever&quot; about it, but a couple &quot;fought back&quot;, citing a bunch of practices that the Wikibooks community didn't really agree with, mostly coming from the Wikipedia system where I guess you never really lose the tools until you do something inappropriate with them. We don't want hijacked accounts or rogue, uninformed users to come around here and do damage since we don't watch pages as closely as Wikipedia does with all the bajillions of bots, etc. and so we're against the &quot;just let the account sit there&quot; approach. These users really shouldn't have even cared since almost all of them never even used the tools (so how do they even know what they're losing?) but to me I think they felt like it was an honor to them and they wanted to keep it as a trophy. I and others were not interested in that and tried to explain that this isn't a punishment and those users can come back and re-apply to be an admin when they need the tools again. A user did that a couple months ago (after he/she was de-sysopped) but had been gone for quite some time and so we weren't quite ready to give the tools back. We usually expect some involvement in community/policy discussion or vandalism control to get a successful sysop vote in.

That's the story I guess. Tell me if you have any questions. I'm staying a little bit inactive here lately (and you seem to be also) due to all the policy procedure circles and the most recent Panic garbage. I hope that's all over now, but some others are waging a war in some areas that I don't want to really get into besides to defend whatever I might add. Anyway, write me back at my talk and I hope you also are doing well. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

== CU Request ==

Mind checking [[User:75.126.154.82]] to see if it's associated with Panic? I just noticed a suspicious edit on his page and figure it's him on another IP. We probably need to get autoblock going to stop him from creating more sockpuppets. Sorry to get you into this but I think you're the only active CU right now.

==Revert==
Herbythyme,

When you revert vandalsim, the subject reads something like: &quot;''Revert to revision 772023 dated 2007-03-02 02:21:41 by 203.97.50.55 using popups''&quot;. How would a person get such a comment automatiaclly, or would they have to do it manually. Or is it an admin tool?

== WIW vote ==

I just wanted to get in touch with you about the WIW vote. I know that you arent a &quot;policy guy&quot;, and that it's unlikely that you've even read the new proposal. I just wanted to assuage your fears that this discussion will come to an untimely end, or that &quot;consensus&quot; will be declared prematurely. The current vote tally is 11-3 (about 80%-20%), and that isn't even close to what we should have if we were going to declare the vote a &quot;victory&quot;. I will personally throw a fit if anybody tries to declare this discussion over before a month or so has passed.

With concerns about consensus out of the way, I would hope that if you liked the policy you could vote for it. We've already received some complaints about the wording of some parts, and those issues would be addressed immediately following a positive vote (if such a thing is achieved). 

If you still dont want to vote for it i can certainly understand your reservation, i was just hoping that i could dispel the fear that this is going to be some kind of a railroading exercise. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:15, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

:I'm certainly not trying to imply that you are ignorant, or that you don't see the things the rest of us do! I know you are more on top of this project then almost anybody else, so I hope i didnt offend you! I don't see this issue as being divisive, because the people who are dissenting are typically dissenting for separate reasons. Xania has fears about the scope, Rob is upset about the process, and Panic is... well i can't ever really figure out what panic is trying to say. I'm not interested in division (although some of my actions may tell a contradictory tale), and I would scrap the whole voting process and go back to square one if i felt this was more destructive then it is constructive. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:34, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

== Good morning ==

I haven't heard from you in quite some time, and Wikibooks can be a very desolate place if we don't force ourselves to interact :). Anyway, the [[Spanish|Spanish Wikibook]] is going well: I've now completed 7 lessons and sets of exercises. Have you seen it recently? Does it still look like it's going on the right track?

I also have a couple of questions. At what stage do you think nominating it for &quot;good book&quot; status be prudent? Certainly not now, but how does one judge completeness? Obviously a language Wikibook can never be finished, though I guess one can get really rather close to it. I guess when one runs out of grammar rules to teach, thus leaving simply words (at which point it's just a dictionary).

OK, that's enough for now. Do reply soon; it's lovely to hear from you. Kindest, warmest regards, [[User:Celestianpower|Celestianpower]] 23:43, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
: Oh, and additionally, what do you think I should do with the section marked &quot;Fragmentos para fusionar&quot;? It has been contributed by others, and doesn't fit into the lessons right now, but might be useful later (particularly the bit on the past tense). It looks messy on the page, and I would ideally like to keep the page to just the reader-orientated course. Hmm. If you have any idea, I'd love to hear them. Cheerful valedictions, [[User:Celestianpower|Celestianpower]] 23:51, 16 April 2007 (UTC)
:: Yeah, I keep myself sane by not becoming obsessed and editing every day. I did that with Wikipedia and it isn't healthy.
::# Wow, thanks :). I might just go and nominate it then...
::# Yes. However, print textbooks generally have far smaller goals than Wikibooks - mine aims to teach Spanish from beginner to advanced level, whereas in print, they tend to be following a particular sillibus for a year or whathaveyou.
::# Yeah, I considered that. I might link it from &quot;Páginas generales&quot;, or move the links to the talkpage. This is the problem though: textbooks need to be written by just one person far more than Encyclopedias. They have to follow the same style, and go through at the same pace, introducing new concepts gradually. Sure, people can help with proof-reading and fact-checking, but the main content has to be added by one person, in my opinion. Otherwise, you get things like these pages - just orphans, or someting like the Spanish Wikibook was before: simply a collection of individual grammar points.
::# Yeah, don't bother with Wikipedia - it's just a breeding ground for trolls and bullies these days. Process has triumphed over flexibility and nothing can get done. It's still a good research tool, but working on it is no fun.
:: I hope you sort out your slug problem soon - sluggy letuce really isn't pleasant. Kind regards, [[User:Celestianpower|Celestianpower]] 16:24, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

== [[Puzzles]] ==

You're my main man for renaming pages and such with your bot, so if you have spare time would you feel like looking at [[Puzzles]] for re-organization? There's some discussion of this on the talk page but a lot of it has to do with colon convention which shouldn't be used. I figured you might be able to slash up all the puzzle pages and maybe even create some sub-categories like what's described on the talk page. I figure Capitalized Naming For All Pages should happen. Reply at my talk if you have anything to say or if you just don't feel like doing this.

== Deleted &quot;Public/sandbox ==

Hi,

I am trying to put together a clearer version of [[Sandbox]] because, as a newbie, I was mislead into thinking that I should modify that page.

So I am developing a new version of the template at [[User:Arsharpe/sandbox/sandboxTemplate]] and, once finished, would propose this as an update.

The current public sandbox [[WikiWikiSandbox]] seems to not help the user to get the best out of the Wiki and at worse can potentially can put people off.
It would be really good if the public sandbox (i.e. for those without an account) had the &quot;edit this page&quot; icon bar, hence my [[Public/sandbox]] that you deleted.

It looks like in the past that there have been some issues with spaming, etc.

Is there a reason that [[WikiWikiSandbox]] cannot have the &quot;edit this page&quot; icon bar ?

Hey HT I have a question for you, what does the new &quot;rollback&quot; button do? I'm not sure if it's reversible so I don't want to try it and break something o-o. Thanks!

== Angelina Johnson / Alicia Spinnet (Muggles' Guide) ==

I see you've been doing a lot of reversion there, and thank you. But... it turns out that our vandal is correct, if very rude. I did make a mistake there, it is Angelina Johnson who is the Quidditch team captain, not Alicia Spinnet. I'll be making that correction, and so a lot of that stuff will be moving, on purpose.

== Stroller Guides ==
I understand about needing the Websites permission...but I am working for Stroller.com! Obviously I was able to put that disclaimer on my articles so that gives permission for them to be used elsewhere
[[User:Sarah.henderson|Sarah.henderson]] 14:02, 31 July 2007 (UTC)

:Hey Herby, I just wanted to post my opinion, hope you don't mind! The boilerplate request for permissions seems to me to be only used in cases where we are asking for permission to use a non-free work. If an original author wants to ''donate'' materials to us, that should be perfectly allowed. We have accepted donations of material before, and some of that material has been posted already elsewhere on the internet. 
:Beyond that, if the stroller guide is released under the GFDL, we are able to copy that work here and use it as the basis for future derivative works, so long as we properly attribute it. To that effect, we could use it and simply post a link.
:If this person is the original author, then she has the right to donate her materials here without having to jump through any hoops. If we must get some kind of &quot;proof&quot; however, we should ask that this user modify the text of that external website in a way that demonstrates that she is who she says she is. 
:This does point to a need, perhaps, for us to come up with a consistent procedure that a person can follow if they want to donate pre-existing materials to our project, but in lieu of such a procedure we need to make decisions on a per-item basis. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:14, 31 July 2007 (UTC)
::I didn't mean to step on your toes herby! I'm just going off my interpretations of things. The way I see it, it doesnt matter whether an author writes their content directly onto our website, writes it on their personal computers first and then uploads it, or even writes it on a different website and then copies it here. Everytime i contribute content, I dont need to send my permission for me to use it to the foundation!

Hi Herby,

Ive just been looking at the list of images with missing copyright statuses and noticed the absolutely huge amount of images from the fhsst textbook that are missing copyright information, there must be at last 200 of them.

I was wondering, how would the community deal with these images, hypothetically, would they have to be removed, cause if they were it would rip the book to shreds?

== Free Citizens Moral Guide ==
Link: [[Free Citizens Moral Guide]]

Thank you for your comments. I posted a request at the [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/New|Staff Lounge]], as you recommended. Sorry for the spam. My CTRL+S reflex strikes again.

::I disagree that this project does not fit here, for being original research, since there are other projects similar in attitude and these seemingly were approved. Please see [[Developing A Universal Religion]]. As a free citizen of the community I request, nay, demand equal rights. ;-)

I posted with this content:

----
'''Rationale'''

I wish to write a self help guide using a collaborative effort. I aim to speak about how to live life in a modern world. I aim to collaboratively create an universal moral guide for all free thinking people in the modern world. Free thinking people of the [[w:Free Culture movement|free culture movement]] and others who think like us.

You can see a rough draft of some of my thoughts at my blog here: [http://refit.blogspot.com REFIT: Refitting our World. Bit by bit].

I believe a Wiki provides the best way to organically write such a document. I am thinking about dividing the guide in two parts:
static and dynamic.

The static part would have personal thoughts, of me or others, signed with our name/alias, on the matter and be protected from changes from others to prevent vandalism and distortion of message. It would serve as a template to the collaborative effort.

The dynamic part would start with the static templates of our personal thoughts and then, collaboratively and in public, organically elaborate on then, to enhance the quality and global reach, converge to a compromise and optimum solution. Just like in Wikipedia.

I believe this effort is not dissimilar to efforts already in this site such as [[Developing A Universal Religion]]. But our organic [[w:Top-down and bottom-up design|approaches]] are different. I go for a bottom-up approach, that goes for top-down approach.

I request your thoughts on how I should proceed to achieve this.

Kind regards,

{{mbox|type=idea|text=Hi, I'm a checkuser on a non-Wikimedia wiki, and I want to share some info on vandalism account IPs with you. There's a new type of vandal, using the usernames &quot;SoulSyncX&quot; (where X is a number or letter), and they add obscene HTML comments and spamlinks to ice-cream and petrol websites. They seem to come from Verizon IP ranges 206.124.64.0 - 206.124.64.255. If you're going to range-block Verizon, block it as 206.124.64.0/24.

However, they do come in on open proxies as well, sometimes they will backslash and they get blocked indefinitely.
We've had no attacks so far from the SoulSyncX obscenity/ice-cream &amp; petrol spammer vandal since the wiki was re-launched.

I'm a checkuser at [http://petitionwiki2007.scribblewiki.com http://petitionwiki2007.scribblewiki.com] which has just re-launched, if you want sysop/bureaucrat status just ask me [http://petitionwiki2007.scribblewiki.com/User talk:Whiteriggs here].

I noticed you reverted back to a prior version for the Human Physiology chapter on integumentary system when a big section was deleted. Just wanted to thank you for catching that and fixing the problem! [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 18:48, 24 September 2007 (UTC)

P.S. I like the integumentary system chapter but feel it would be better in an anatomy book rather than a physiology book. How would I go about moving it?

== [[Aspies Book/Resources]] ==

I think perhaps that anonymous user might of had a good idea. By linking to the website in which the list is maintained, there is no need to copy this list here, which could quickly become outdated. I know you prefer to keep links to other websites to a minimal, so did you revert because you felt it was violating [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks_is_not_a_soapbox]]?

== Well, I oppose it... ==
I oppose your interpretation that the book/page Morality/Murder should be deleted, based on the result of the previous discussion about it on VfD now closed by you.

The indication that the book was a copyvio was not validated, the votes were not enough and not based on a proper reason for the deletion (all were based on the presumable copyvio).

As such I have changed the impending doom tag to the previous VfD (so not to have the page deleted). I ask you that you reformulate the VfD with a justification for the delete or remove the VfD tag completely.  ---- &lt;small&gt;—The preceding unsigned comment was added by [[User:Panic2k4|Panic2k4]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 16:40, 7 Oct 2007  (UTC{{{3|}}})&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned2 --&gt;

:Don't let this get to you, Panic's behavior is hardly representative of Wikibooks at large. I stand behind your action to close the VfD, a single opposition isnt enough to halt a VfD, it's left up to the best judgement of an admin (and I would consider your &quot;best judgement&quot; to be a very reliable metric). Mike.lifeguard already re-closed the nomination, so there is no going back now. Sorry.  --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:48, 11 October 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks talk:Blocking guideline]] ==
The policy was now put forward as a guideline (not a policy, like you indicate on your vote). and a guideline can be broken with justification (so new and unexpected situations will not be a problem). In any case it is better to have the guideline that to let it be open to personal interpretations and the text cover most of the problems and discussions we have been having in the last years in cases the block action was used.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:05, 13 October 2007 (UTC)

==Vandalism==

Good to see you Herby :-)  He's made quite a mess hasn't he?  What happened to to the Vandalism in Progress page? I wasn't quite sure what to do. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 12:14, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

Hi, please undelete [[User talk:Ans|my talk page]], it has non vandal contents in the previous revision :) --[[User:Ans|Ans]]

Could you please block vandals before you start reverting them from now on, so they can't continue to increase the work load of reverting them? I noticed that the vandal was being allowed to continue to vandalize while you were reverting there changes, before you blocked them. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:55, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

:Was this comment refering to myself or Herby?  If it was Herby then you are mistaken as the first thing they did was to block the vandal.  If myself then I can't as I'm not an admin, I just figured I keep reverting his and mine talk pages to try and distract him from do so much damage while I waited for an admin to turn up. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] 22:27, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

::I was referring to Herby. From what I saw from the recent changes page, it looks like he first reverted about 5 pages or more before he blocked, which by then had given the vandal time to vandalize way more pages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:43, 15 November 2007 (UTC)

:Here are the logs that I see. Herby's first log entry on Nov 15 is:

 08:11, 15 November 2007 Herbythyme (Talk | contribs | block) blocked IJstLrndAlotAboutStargateAtWP 
 (Talk | contribs) with an expiry time of infinite (account creation disabled) ‎ (vandalism) (unblock)

:This is followed by several page deletions and revisions. At 8:36, Herby did a CU on the vandal and got these IP addresses, after the vandal had been blocked (with account creation disabled) and the mess had already been cleaned up. He also did a CU for the IP address on meta to double-check the situation there. Here are the block log entries after the CU check:

 08:49, 15 November 2007 Herbythyme (Talk | contribs | block) blocked 88.108.200.223 (Talk) with an 
 expiry time of 1 day (account creation disabled, autoblock disabled) ‎ (unblock)
 08:37, 15 November 2007 Herbythyme (Talk | contribs | block) blocked 71.108.63.152 (Talk) with an 
 expiry time of 1 week (account creation disabled, autoblock disabled) ‎ (Haggar) (unblock)

:My conclusion of this is that he did block first, cleaned up second, then did a very thorough CU check both here and on meta, blocked the offending IPs, and cleaned up more mess. Missing the first block log entry, it would certainly appear that Herby did things in the wrong order. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 15:30, 16 November 2007 (UTC)

== I imagine ==

People may be watching this page.  Thanks for the messages.  I am offline for the weekend and will post something when back --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:29, 17 November 2007 (UTC)

== My thoughts ==

I've spent a little time reflecting on this over the weekend.  Not the vandalism issues (which is frankly ludicrous - why would I wish to prolong the work, it took 25 minutes anyway) but on the ''&quot;anger &amp; defensiveness&quot;'' issue and realised that I am getting like that here.

I'd ask anyone who is interested to checkout my other talk pages and contributions and see if you find anything other than maybe a trace of irritation.  I don't think so, so others may wish to reflect on that - &quot;behaviour breeds behaviour&quot;.  I've met some of the nicest folk here and hope I will stay in contact with some of them for a long time to come.  However I think for my sake and that of the community it may be time to hand over the tools and move on.  Getting anything done here is like herding cats (not an insult, I like cats).  I'll not do anything hasty - I have the &quot;Picture of the Year&quot; completion coming up on Commons in Jan (a great showcase for some very talented Wikimedians) and the Steward elections on Meta (those who are interested really should take a look and vote, there are some very good candidates).  I'll review the situation after that.

Thanks again for the appreciation, it may well be best to consider me rather absent for now, regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 09:03, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

:I think that your only problem here, Herby (if one can even call it a problem) is that you don't have a full-enough sense of your value to this project. You just don't realize how valuable you are here! When somebody criticizes you, you need to just stand your ground and say &quot;Shut up biotch, I'm Herbythyme! I'm a freaking celebrity around here!&quot;. Well, maybe it wouldn't be good to call anybody a &quot;biotch&quot;, but I think you get my point. All the glowing support votes that you get for your various RFA nominations around the wiki-world should be evidence of your celebrity status. step back and take a deep breath ''if you absolutely need to'', otherwise you're too important to us to be threatening to leave. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:12, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

: I think things often get tense around here, and I'm sure it is not meant as anything personal, though I think I understand your frustration (which is why I try to stay out of politics around here). I do agree that your contributions have been very valuable, and hope that we haven't burned you out.

:G'day mate, I'm late to the party as usual, but want to throw in my AUD0.02 worth. First off, you do great work here and that is widely recognised, even though you may not feel that it is sometimes. Secondly, words written in black on white don't convey tone as easily as spoken words, and this often leads to misinterpretation - don't read too much into the comments of others, ''especially'' when they are mistaken. Thirdly, you need a break! That doesn't necessarily mean that you need to leave us altogether, just that you sound wound-up and stressed and need to step back for a while. As for &quot;behaviour breeds behaviour&quot;, that is very true, but also there is the option to turn the other cheek and accept an explanation at face value sometimes. Be the better man (or woman, or little furry creature from Alpha Centauri). But please, mate, do take a break - you deserve one!

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The Allegory of the Vine (15:1-17)'''

The idea of the vine stalk, the branches,  the grapes  and the Father is the perfect metaphor and clearly shows us our relationship to the Father. The farmer is the superior being.  The stalk, the branches and the grapes are not in the same league with the farmer. He is a human and they are plants and fruit. No one considers the plants to be equal to the farmer. 

The father is God and the stalk and branches are only humans. The branches are inferior to the stalk and deprive their life by being united to the stalk.If we detach from Jesus we are going to wither and go into the fire.

The Father tends the vine with loving care, making it as fruitful as possible.  He removes the unfruitful branches and prunes the fruitful ones so that they may be even more fruitful. However, this pruning is a painful process.  Jesus uses this metaphor to relate back to God as well.  &quot;I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower,&quot; (15:2). 

Life comes to the branches from the vine. Life comes to believers through the words of Jesus. He said my words are spirit and life. My words are truth. I fear that Christians have been misled to think that life and truth comes from the whole Bible. Each writer of the Bible is a vine, but only the vine of Jesus gives life. It is fine to read the whole Bible but we must only build are theology on the one vine. We must not try to draw sustenance from 66 vines. Jesus says that as a part of that vine, all will bear fruit.  It is a very cyclical metaphor through the reader to Jesus and always coming back to the Father.  The best example of this is Verse 8, &quot;My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.&quot;  Likewise, Jesus connects the metaphor to the theme of love. &quot;As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love,&quot; (15:9).  &quot;Love&quot; is a very crucial concept in Jesus' metaphor of the vine.  A &quot;vine-grower&quot; in any self-respecting vineyard must take very good care of the vine and its branches.  Time, energy, and investment of will are factors that can be associated with any tender of vines.  This is also implied by the allegory of the vine.  The Father, otherwise known as &quot;the vine-grower&quot;, will love and keep his vine and its branches.    

An interesting point to note is the language of Jesus being the &quot;true&quot; vine. This language could merely be a reference to the spiritual metaphor being relayed - that the spiritual vine is more true than the physical vine - but it may also be a reference to the existence of a &lt;i&gt;false&lt;/i&gt; vine, perhaps the equivalent of a false prophet.


There are some similarities between the vine in John and other sections in the Synoptics.  First of all, in Matt 26, Mark 14, and Luke 22, Jesus discusses &quot;drinking of the fruit of the vine at the Last Supper&quot; (Smith 280).  Jesus also has a parable about a vineyard in Matt 21, Mark 12, and Luke 20.  While these parallels are quite obvious because of the similarity in language (both use &quot;vine&quot; and vineyard&quot;), the Sermon on the Mount/Plain in Matt 7 and Luke 6 are probably most similar to the Allegory of the Vine in John 15.  In these Synoptic stories, the word &quot;tree&quot; is used, with a similar emphasis on the fruit of the tree as John emphasizes the fruit of the vine.  The Gospel of Matt speaks of &quot;cutting down and burning the tree that does not bear good fruit&quot; (Smith 281), which is similar to John 15: 6, which states, &quot;Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.&quot;  The synoptics seem to imply that &quot;'fruit' stands for good deeds accomplished through obedience to God or...to the words of Jesus&quot; (Smith 281).  It is possible to read John 15's vine story in a similar fashion.  (Smith)

'''John 15:7-17 - Results of Abiding in Christ'''

Abiding in Christ has many results in verses 7-17.  First, abiding means that we can request what we will and God will do it for us. If one really abides in Christ and Christ abides in him/her, the requesting will not be different to the will of Christ.  Verse 8 states that God the Father is glorified by the mutual abiding. As disciples fulfill His will and continue the work of Christ, God attains the greatest glory.  That mutual abiding causes the disciples to bear fruit - it is the fruit of Christ-likeness.  If a disciple becomes Christ-like he/she will love the other disciples. Thus the idea of becoming true disciples in the last part of verse 8 leads into discussion of the mutual love between Father, Son, and disciples in verse 9.  Another result of mutual abiding is joy. Jesus finds joy with his union with the Father.  The love and obedience that Jesus calls his disciples to and their union with him will be the source of their joy. The plan of discipleship is the will of God revealed in Christ (R. Hahn, 2007).

'''Verse 16-It Was Not You Who Chose Me....'''

This first part of verse 16 is an interesting one because it seems to have that air of predestination to it in that Jesus has chosen us to follow him from the beginning, and we had no say in it at all.  Or rather, does he mean that overall we were chosen to follow him, but  we think it was our free will that led us there?  As in it is a bit of both worlds.  For instance, our free will could lead us to our pred destined choice of being with Jesus. This would essentially explain the first part of the verse that says that it was Jesus who chose us rather than vice versa.  Does that makes sense?

'''Verse 24 'THEY HATED ME WITHOUT A CAUSE.''''  

This verse states, &quot;If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.&quot;  This verse has a very similar message to John 9:41, when Jesus says, &quot;...If you were blind, you would not have sin.  But now that you say, 'We see,' your sin remains.&quot;  The kind of &quot;sin&quot; Jesus is talking about in 15:24 and 9:41 is potentially confusing.  However, in 15:20 Jesus references those who persecute Him and His servants.  Then, in 15:25, Jesus references those who &quot;hate [Him] without a cause.&quot;  Considering the context of 15:24, Jesus is most likely saying that those who have seen His words and signs don't have an excuse for not believing in Him.  Jesus is probably also saying that no one has an excuse for persecuting those who follow Him. Jesus also is suggesting that people do not want to leave their lives of sin behind. The people have seen the works of Jesus, but are too afraid to live righteous lives. Because of this, Jesus says the people show their hatred not only of him, but also of his Father. 


The idea that this verse was pertaining to a specific sin- Hating Jesus with out a cause, and not to sin in general can be supported with other verses around the bible. However, first we should look back  in John 16:24 to begin to understand the verse which says: &quot;If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well.&quot; (NAS) This verse can have different interpretations, naturally. Some believe that the significance of this verse is not that these people who have sinned have seen the laws and have no excuse for not believing in Him, but more importantly that the people were used &quot;...in order that the word may be fulfilled that is written in their Law, 'They Hated Me without a Cause.' (NAS) It wasn't that His people didn't believe in Him, because in verse 27 it says; &quot;and you will bear witness also, because you have been with Me from the beginning.&quot; (NAS) It was more the fact that the people, even after knowing Jesus, and seeing His works, were Hating Him without a Cause in order for the word to be fulfilled. The word that was to be fulfilled was naturally Jesus’ upcoming death and resurrection.  This belief is supported in several other books in the bible. For example, Matt 26:24 :54-56 16:21; Luke 9:22&amp;44 18:31-34 24:25-27 &amp; 44-46 all of these refer to this law that was to be fulfilled, not for the sole purpose of exclaiming that these people had no excuse for believing in Him.

'''Christ without Chastisement'''  

Throughout the Gospel of John, Christ dispenses wisdom along with subtle admonishments (such as &quot;Go and sin no more,&quot; with regard to the woman at the well.  In Chapter 15, however, He gives an otherworldly kind of pep-talk that is bereft of any of His usual requests/rebukes: &quot;If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.  If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own.  As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world&quot; (verses 18-9).  He is preparing his disciples for the rush of confusion, anger, doubt, and persecution that is to follow in the wake of His death.  His greatest commandment, in verse 17, is another such attempt to bind the disciples together, for only love is strong enough to survive the seeds of division that had already been planted.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Embedded Control Systems Design Page}}
==RTOS==

RTOS are OS which act in RT. This means that RTOS have other purposes than general OS or EOS (define:EOS). Where the general OS have the goal to maximize the average throughput of tasks (data?), in RTOS the keyword is determinism. Tasks have to be dealt with in a certain deterministic amount of time. Violation of the specified timing constraints is (normally) considered catastrophic. Because of this strong difference, the implementations of RTOS differ significantly from other OS, although the general principles are the same.&lt;br&gt; 

Some people make a distinction between soft and hard RTOS, but in fact there's no such strict distinction possible{{fact}}. On the other hand it is possible to say that one task is more “hard” RTOS than another one, meaning that it is more crucial to complete the first task in time. &lt;br&gt;

RTOS have 4 main responsibilities: 
*task management and scheduling; 
*(deferred) interrupt servicing; 
*inter-process communication and synchronization; and 
*memory management.&lt;br&gt;

==Design of RTOS==

Because determinism is often compromised in “high-level” programming language and OS constructs, real-time designers are confronted more directly than “normal” application developers with concepts, timing, memory and efficiency at the level of the OS.&lt;br&gt;

===Task management and scheduling===
The responsibility of task management includes the scheduling of the multiple tasks. Because scheduling is pure overhead, the RTOS implement scheduling algorithms which are not too complex. 

The simpler the algorithm, the faster, smaller (less memory) and more predictable the task will be executed.&lt;br&gt; 

The simplest approach to the scheduling problem is to assign (static/dynamic) priorities to all tasks. It's quite obvious as an example that the creation and deletion of tasks shouldn't be done during RT-tasks.&lt;br&gt;

Using priorities implies using '''pre-emption''': a lower priority task which is running should be interrupted in order to run a higher priority task. Priority-based scheduling, however, is difficult for the application programmers: they must try to map the often complex synchronization interdependencies between the different threads in their application onto the linear scale offered by priorities. The problem with this kind of scheduling is that it is an indirect way to specify how to cope with timing and synchronization constraints: these are translated in priorities.&lt;br&gt;

One often-observed phenomenon in RT applications that grow over time, is that the programmers tend to raise the priorities of some threads, every time they notice that the introduction of new functionality disturbs the synchronization of the existing threads. &lt;br&gt;

It's actually the system designer who has to decide which tasks get which priorities, because many programmers have the urge to prioritize their tasks. In this case it's important to see there's only 1 task which should obtain the highest priority. One could say that that task is the “hardest” task in the context of hard/soft RT.&lt;br&gt;

====Timers====
The timing constraints of RT-tasks are often specified in less than micro-seconds instead of milliseconds. Hence, the data structure in which the time is kept should be adapted to this higher rate, in order to avoid overflow. A 32 bit counter would rapidly overflow if the OS counts in nanoseconds (e.g. (2^32)/(10^9) = 4 seconds till overflow). In this case it would be more appropriate to use a 64 bit counter. These timers are called high resolution timers.

*problem with atomic operation for a 64 bit counter?&lt;br&gt;

====Watchdog timers====
The ISR contains one or more watchdog timers.{{citation needed}} Such a timer triggers a restoring task if the current running task is taking too much time in which nothing really happened. Through this way possible faults (such as a hang) can be covered for. The watchdog could then possibly provide debugging information, if it is designed for it.

Watchdog timers may also trigger control systems to move into a safety state, such as turning off motors, high-voltage electrical outputs, and other potentially dangerous subsystems until the fault is cleared.&lt;br&gt;

See also: [[Embedded Control Systems Design/DesignPatterns#Watchdog timer | hardware watchdog timers]].

===Interrupt servicing===
Most modern OS are interrupt-driven. This means that if there are no processes waiting to be executed, no I/O-devices requesting a service and no users waiting for an answer, the OS waits till something happens. 

Events are almost always signaled by an [[w:Interrupt|interrupt]] or a [[w:Trap_%28computing%29|trap]]. A trap is an interrupt that is generated by the software, either after an error or after a specific request of a user program to execute a system service. For each type of interrupt there are separate code segments available in the OS. These segments determine how the OS reacts on a particular event. Peripheral hardware are special in that they can request the attention of the OS asynchronously, e.g. at the time they want to use the OS services, the OS has to make sure it is ready to service the requests. These requests are signaled by an interrupt. It's rather obvious that during a real-time task those other tasks (reading/writing on disks, accessing USB, etc.) should be postponed.&lt;br&gt;

The OS is, in principle, not involved in the execution of the code triggered by the hardware interrupt: this is taken care by the CPU without software interference. The OS does have influence on 
*connecting a memory address to every interrupt line and 
*what has to be done immediately after the interrupt has been serviced. 

What does this mean for a RTOS?
Interrupts have to be processed by a so-called ISR (Interrupt Service Routine). The faster this ISR can do his job, the better the real-time performance of the RTOS, because other tasks are delayed less. Let’s take a look at the hardware and software side of an interrupt-driven system (which many RTOS and EOS are) and their typical components.

====Interrupt Hardware====
*;&lt;u&gt;Interrupt vector vs non-vectored Interrupt proc.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:An Interrupt vector is used in systems with more than one hardware interrupt line and all these interrupt lines are assembled in an interrupt vector.  The interrupt vector is an array of pointers to the interrupt service routines. In non-vectored systems when an interrupt occurs, control is transferred to a single routine that decides what to do with the interrupt. For RT-systems an interrupt vector is feasible because it lowers the processing time of an interrupt.

*;&lt;u&gt;Edge-triggered and level-triggered interrupts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:Peripheral devices can transmit their interrupt signals in two different ways. Edge-triggered interrupts hold risks for a hardware or software loss of the interrupt and are generally not an efficient solution. For RTOS and EOS where determinism is an important factor level-triggered interrupts are favourable.

*;&lt;u&gt;Interrupt controller&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:This is a piece of hardware that shields the OS from the electronic details of the interrupt lines. Some are able to queue interrupts so that none get lost (determinism!) and some allow assigning priorities to different interrupts. Examples are a PIC or an APIC. Working with an APIC is beneficial in a RTOS and EOS.

====Interrupt Software====

&lt;u&gt;Interrupt Service Routine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This software routine is called when an interrupt occurs on the interrupt line for which the ISR has been registered in the interrupt vector. The OS does not intervene in the launching of an ISR, everything is done by the CPU. The context of the current task is saved on the stack of that task, so each task must get enough stack space to cope with ISR overhead. An ISR should be as short as possible, because it runs with interrupts disabled, which prevents other interrupts from being served and tasks from proceeding (RTOS!). Further processing is a goal of the DSR. Getting data from the ISR to the DSR should be done in a non-blocking way.  

&lt;u/&gt;Trap handler/service request&lt;u/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The software interrupts are called by the processor itself, such as in the case of a register overflow, errors,... They are similar to hardware interrupts, but they run with hardware interrupts enabled. 

&lt;u&gt;Interrupt latency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is the time between the arrival of the hardware interrupt and the execution of the corresponding ISR. It is a statistical quantity and it is important to try and get this number as low as possible and as deterministic as possible in an RTOS. Modern processors with many levels cache and pipelines are prone to indeterminism

&lt;u&gt;Interrupt priorities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Adds complexity and problems/opportunities known in task scheduling to the interrupt handling. Not wanted in a RTOS/EOS.

&lt;u&gt;Interrupt nesting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Adds complexity to the code. In a deterministic environment is this not wanted. 

&lt;u&gt;Interrupt sharing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Many systems allow different peripheral devices to be linked to the same hardware interrupt. The ISR servicing this interrupt must then be able to find out which device generated the interrupt. RTOS do not support this feature; they only allow one single ISR per IRQ, in order to be as deterministic as possible. So a RT system designer should be careful when putting interface cards in your computer because all the ones for which you want to install real-time drivers must be connected to different interrupt lines !

===''Interprocess communication IPC and synchronisation''===

Because there are tasks that have to communicate with each other, the need exists for synchronization of different tasks, as well as for data exchange between them. The RTOS should provide easy and safe IPC primitives which can be used for programmers to build their software systems. These primitives can have different effects on task scheduling (blocking, non-blocking, conditional blocking, blocking with time out), can use different degrees of coupling (named connection, broadcast, blackboard, object request broker) and buffering.&lt;br&gt;
The origin of most problems with resource sharing (or allocation) in multi-tasking and multi-processor systems is the fact that operations on resources can usually not be performed atomically, i.e., as if they were executed as one single, non-interruptible instruction that takes zero time. Indeed, a task that interfaces with a resource can at any instant be pre-empted, and hence, when it gets re-scheduled again, it cannot just take for granted that the data it uses now is in the same state before the pre-emption. Some parts of the code are called 'critical sections' because it is critical to the validity of the code that the access to the data used for a certain statement be executed atomically: un-interruptible by anything else. (Most) machine code instructions of a given processor execute atomically, but instructions in higher-level programming languages are usually translated into a sequence of many machine code instructions.&lt;br&gt;
The main problem is called a “race condition”: two or more tasks compete against each other to get access to the same shared resources. Examples of these race conditions are the following: deadlock, livelock, starvation. Algorithms are available that avoid these race conditions, some more complex than others.&lt;br&gt;
There are many types of synchronization: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_%28computer_science%29 barrier]  , [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29 semaphore], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutex mutex], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinlock spinlock], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers-writer_lock read/write lock]  (and lock-free for data exchange).&lt;br&gt;
When a task reaches its so-called critical section, it requests a lock. Now it can get the lock if it isn't taken by another task and enters the critical section, or it has to wait (“blocked”, “sleeps”) till the other task releases the lock at the end of its critical section. A blocked task cannot be scheduled for execution, so locks are to be used with care in RT applications! The application programmer should be sure about the maximum amount of time that a task can be delayed because of locks held by other tasks; and this maximum should be less than the specified timing constraints of the system. The lock concept can easily lead to unpredictable latencies in the scheduling of a task. It doesn't protect the data directly, but synchronizes the code that accesses the data. As with scheduling priorities, locks give disciplined programmers a means to reach deterministic performance measures. But discipline is not sufficient to guarantee consistency in large-scale systems.&lt;br&gt;
The problem with using locks is that they make an application vulnerable for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion| priority inversion problem]. This should be prevented in the design phase. Another problem occurs when the CPU on which the task holding the lock is running, suddenly fails, or when that task enters a trap and/or exception, because then the lock is not released, or, at best its release is delayed.&lt;br&gt;
====Some remarks about the types of synchronization:====
&lt;u&gt;Semaphore - spinlock&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A semaphore is a lock for which the normal behaviour of the locking task is to go to sleep. Hence, this involves the overhead of context switching, so don't use semaphores for critical sections that should take only a very short time; in these cases spinlocks are a more appropriate choice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Semaphore - mutex&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Many programmers also tend to think that a semaphore is necessarily a more primitive RTOS function than a mutex. This is not necessarily so, because one can implement a counting semaphore with a mutex and a condition variable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Spinlock&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Spinlocks work if the programmer is disciplined enough to use them with care, that is for guaranteed very short critical sections. In principle, the latency induced by a spinlock is NOT deterministic (not RT). But they offer a good solution in the case that the scheduling and context switching times generated by the use of locks, are larger than the time required to execute the critical section the spinlock is guarding.&lt;br&gt;

===IPC and data exchange===
Mechanisms of all data IPC exchange are quite similar; the OS has some memory space reserved for the data that has to be exchanged and uses some synchronisation IPC primitives for reading or writing to that memory space. The main difference between different forms of data exchange lies in their policy. 
Two or more tasks often have some form of shared memory. Possible problems are the available space in the RAM and some control over the ''freshness'' of the shared data '''What do you mean with the ''freshness'' of the shared data?'''.  Shared memory has the properties of a [[w:Device_node|block device]] ; programs can access arbitrary blocks on the device in any sequence. Character devices can only access data in a linear sequence.
[[w:FIFO|FIFO]] is such a device. In a RT-system no lock is needed on the real-time side as no user program can interrupt the real-time side. Another form of IPC data exchange is using messages and mailboxes. Again for a real-time system there are some things to pay attention to. An IPC approach which uses dynamic memory allocation is not feasible for a RT-system.[[w:Circular_buffer|Circular buffers ]]  is another possibility of IPC. There are some possible problems with data loss though, so an RT-system uses some specific options. These are: locking in memory and buffer half full.  A better solution is using a swinging buffer. This is an advanced circular buffer and a deadlock-free lock. A swinging buffer is non-blocking and loss-prone.

===Memory management===
The job of the OS is memory allocation and memory mapping and to take action when a task uses memory that is not allocated (memory protection). Some of the points of attention in memory management in a RT-system are: 

&lt;u&gt;Fast and deterministic memory management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The easiest is no memory management at all. Some RTOS/EOS offer some basic memory management; memory allocation and deletion through system calls.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Page locking&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The MMU (memory management unit) must lock pages of real-time memory tasks in the physical RAM in order to avoid the paging overhead of swapping pages from the mechanical disk drive to the RAM. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Dynamic allocation&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;
A task’s memory may change during the lifetime of a task, so that it asks the OS for more memory. In order to do this in a deterministic way the memory pages need a pool of free pages locked in the memory. Dynamic allocation should be used very carefully in a Real-Time task. This also implies that IPC with dynamic allocation needs are to be avoided.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Memory mapping&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Mapping is a configuration activity and should not be done in real-time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Memory sharing &lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;
This is an efficient way for two tasks to communicate. The OS is responsible for 1) the (de)allocation of shared memory and 2) synchronizing the access to that memory by different tasks. There is nothing particularly real time about using shared memory, allocating it is though. The shared-memory pool is a block of physical memory set aside at the boot time, so that the OS does not use it for its processes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;RAM Disks &lt;/u&gt; &lt;br&gt;
In order to avoid the non-deterministic overhead of accessing hard disks, part of the available RAM can be used to emulate a hard disk. To have some sort of non-volatile memory that is deterministic a designer can choose to use a flash disk.



==Issues in Real Time System Design==


A Real Time system’s goal is to behave deterministically. Determinism implies two aspects. First, if the process asks for CPU, RAM or communication, it should receive it from the coordination. Second, if a failure occurs, the system should know what to do. For a system designer, the most important features of a Real Time application are scheduling tasks, coping with failure and using available resources.



===Scheduling tasks===

The system designer has to make sure that (at least a clearly identified, small) part of the systems processes are scheduled in a predictable way because, even more than timing, the sequence of processes is an important part of the application. Scheduling of the processes can for example be done by the scheduler. It’s essential that the sequence is determined in a deterministic way, but the scheduler might not suffice here. For example, if two processes have the same priority, it might be unclear what process will come first. A system designer should not expect to know the duration of a process, even if this process gets the full capacity of the processor. Therefore the designer has to make sure that the scheduling works, even in case of the worst scenario.



===Failure===

The system should behave reliably during internal or external failure. Possible failures should be known by the real time system. If the process can’t recover from a failure, the system should go into a “fail safe/gracefully mode”. If the system can’t satisfy the task’s timing constraints and therefore also the quality demands, it should take action by triggering an error. In such a case, it is important to check if it is possible to remove certain constraints.
Internal failure can be a hard- or a software failure in the system. To cope with software failure, tasks should be designed to safeguard error conditions. Hardware failure can be processor, board or link failure. 
To detect failure the system designer should implement [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer watchdog] systems. If the main program neglects to regularly service the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer watchdog], it can trigger a system reset.
	


===Resources and services===

In the context of resources and services the term Quality of Service (QoS) is important. It means that the task must get a ﬁxed amount of “service” per time unit. This service includes hardware, processing time and communication and is deterministically known by the system. In contrast to general OS, the hardware needs to be specifically assigned for every process. In assigning service to tasks, the programmer should take into account “worst case scenarios”: if various tasks could be needing a service, then sooner or later they will want it at the same time. Then the sequence has to maximise the quality of service.



===Complexity===

There are three classes of system complexity. The first, C1, has centralized hardware and a centralized state. Everything is determined and external factors have no influence on the process. Such a system can be designed by one person. The simplest robots belong to this category. The last, C3, has decentralized hardware and a decentralized state. The system adapts the process due to external factors when necessary. Such a system requires more (approximately 100) designers. An example is the RoboCup team. C2 is an intermediate level and it has decentralized hardware and a centralized state, like for example industrial robots do.  Such systems require about 10 designers.
The higher the complexity of the interactions (synchronisation and communication) in the system, the harder to make it deterministic because much more aspects should be taken into account.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Some facts about Tuberculosis ==
     
Tuberculosis (TB) is a common and deadly infectious disease that undergoes a resurgence nowadays. The [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs104/en/index.html WHO] estimates that over one-third of world´s population now carries the bacterium in their bodies. People who are HIV-positive face a much higher risk being infected with TB bacilli because their immune systems are compromised by the HIV. Other indicators which may favour the prevalence of TB are bad alimentation, insufficient hygienic circumstances combined with nonexistent medical measures.

== Abstract ==

Being neglected for a long time tuberculosis reached a pandemic dimension in many regions around the world. What reasons may there be for such a spread? As mentioned above, there seems to be a consensus about the majority of factors that favour this disease. Nevertheless new hypotheses about the relation between the prevalence of tuberculosis and certain factors have to be quantified by the means of statistical methods, which are carried out with statistical software.

Thus, according to a famous saying from Confucius the goal of our analysis is the way, to be more precise, the way how to assess and deal with multivariate datasets. Nevertheless we will develop some hypotheses about the relations of our variables in the course of the analysis. For a quick glimpse check the section about [[Analysis of Tuberculosis#Multivariate Analysis|multivariate analysis]] and its subsections.

The program used for this analysis is the [http://www.xplore-stat.de/index_js.html MDTech XploRe Software]. All major steps of the analysis can easily be reproduced by the program code provided in this study (usually together with the graphics in the ''image space''). All you need is the original data called '''&quot;datest.csv&quot;''', which is availabale on http://www.quantlet.org/mdbase/, and the [http://www.xplore-stat.de/academic/academic.html free academic version of the software XploRe].

== Description of the Original Data Set ==

The analysis is based upon a dataset called '''&quot;datest.csv&quot;''', which is available on the homepage of [http://www.quantlet.org/mdbase MD*Base].

The missing values that appeared in the original dataset (datorg.csv) have been replaced by estimated values using different methods, like the mean of neighbouring countries, linear regression and other techniques. Since the data was collected from the UN you may have a closer look at the definitions of each variable at the homepage of the [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cdb/cdb_list_dicts.asp United Nations Statistics Division].

The dataset contains 163 observations and 16 variables. The first variable is a text-variable showing the names of the countries, the second variable assigns each country to a continent and is therefore nominal (from one to six). All other variables are described in the following Table:

&lt;br clear=&quot;both&quot;/&gt;

== Transformation of the Data ==

As you can see from table 1 the variables are measured on a different scale. Tuberculosis is measured per 100.000 people while for example the estimated aids related deaths are given in total numbers of the population.
Thus, the first step of our analysis is to rearrange the dataset such that it is more clearly ordered and scaled in a more appropriate way.

The program below is used to:

* add a column with a country code to the dataset
* standardize the scale of all three diseases to &quot;per 100.000&quot;
* change total numbers of internet accesses, personal computers and telephone lines to relative numbers
* rearrange the order of variables such that:
**the first to third column contain countrycode, continentcode and population
**the fourth to sixth column contain standardized values for aids estimated deaths, malaria prevalence and tuberculosis prevalence, respectively
**the variable &quot;condom use&quot; appears in the eighth column, followed by the rest of the variables in original order

The program will load the original data and create two CSV-files that contain the rearranged dataset (including country names) and the country names only. Before you run the program, make sure that you have downloaded the original data '''&quot;datest.csv&quot;''' from the homepage of [http://www.quantlet.org/mdbase MD*Base] to a known directory.

== Univariate Analysis ==

To start with we would like to present an overview of some descriptive data on the explanatory variables considering the five number summary, skewness and kurtosis.The skewness &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and the kurtosis &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; measure the skewness and the departure
from the normal distribution, respectively:

&lt;math&gt;s =\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(x_{i}-{\bar{x}})^3} {v^3}\right]&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;math&gt;k =\left[ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(x_{i}-{\bar{x}})^4} {v^4}\right]          &lt;/math&gt;

The skewness should be close to 0 for a distribution that is symmetric around &lt;math&gt;\overline{x}&lt;/math&gt;. The kurtosis should be close to 3 for a distribution resembling the normal.

=== Boxplots, Histograms and Quantile-Quantile Plots===


With conventional mechanisms of the univariate analysis we will now have a look on all variables of interest for our later model. For an integrated overview, we first focus on multi-graphic displays that contain information about more than just one variable.

[[Image:Datest_Boxplot1.JPG|thumb|left|250px| Graphic 1, Have a look on the program code for these boxplots by clicking on the picture.]]

Let us have a look at [[:Image:Datest_Boxplot1.JPG| graphic 1]] and [[:Image:Datest_Histograms1.JPG| graphic 2]], in which we computed the boxplots and histograms for the diseases in our data namely tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS. 

[[Image:Datest_Histograms1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Graphic 2, Have a look on the program code for these histograms by clicking on the picture.]]

As mentioned above all three variables had been transformed to the scale per 100.000 people. For better visualisation in [[:Image:Datest_Boxplot1.JPG| graphic 1]] we standardized the x-axis, otherwise the boxplots for tuberculosis and malaria would have been too compressed. For all three variables we observe skewness to the right nevertheless the characteristic of the outlier distribution differs a lot. So for tuberculosis we only identified one outlier (Cambodia) while for the AIDS-deaths overall 38 outliers are displayed of which 24 are moderate (circles) and 14 are more distinct (crosses) ones. We decided to identify these outliers and it turns out that about 90% of the outliers are African countries and accordingly about 72% of African countries are outliers. Shall a whole continent be excluded here? Definitely not but this fact provides us with a hint for possible subgroups within the data.

[[Image:Datest_Histograms2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Graphic 4, Have a look on the program code for these histograms by clicking on the picture.]]
Grapics 3 to 5 provide us with the results of our univariate analysis of possible explanatory variables on our dependent variable tuberculosis.

[[Image:Datest_qqplot.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Graphic 5, QQ-plot for explanatory variables]]
In [[:Image:Datest_Boxplots.JPG| graphic 3]] we see the boxplots for those mentioned. Be aware that we displayed the boxplots on different scales. The upper five boxplots are measured in percent while we decided to standardize the y-axis for the lower boxplots. One important remark has to be done on the boxplot for access to drugs: Although it seems there is only one outlier it turns out that this &quot;point&quot; are altogether 37 countries falling into the 0% - 50% class.

The skewness of the data can also be anticipated and is proved in [[:Image:Datest_Histograms2.JPG| graphic 4]], where we display the average shifted curve together with the histograms. Again what catches the eye is the fact that the upper variables, except for access to drugs, are skewed the left while the lower are skewed to the right. That means the majority of countries have relatively high values for the variables displayed in the upper part and relatively low values for those variables displayed in the lower part.
[[:Image:Datest_qqplot.JPG| graphic 5]] displays the quantile-quantile plots which are used to compare each variable with the normal distribution. Apparently we have a clear deviation from the 45° line which indicates that the variables are not normally distributed.

Altogether, the main finding of the univariate analysis is that we have very skewed distributions, which in part coincide among the different variables. This might be an indicator for strong correlations between the single dimensions. Anyway, the question remains whether these relations are linear or not. Furthermore, we have seen many outliers in the different dimensions of the dataset. Thus, the question arises whether the outliers of one dimension are also outliers in other dimension of our data. This question will be dealed with in the next section.

== Outlier Treatment with Simple Multivariate Methods ==

As we have seen in the univariate analysis, we face a very heterogeneous dataset with extremely skewed distributions and therefore with many observations being displayed as outliers. This goes up to the point, where almost a whole continent would be excluded from the analysis, namely Africa in terms of aids related death rates. This might motivate a separate analysis of Africa.

But here, our goal is to find methods to better handle multidimensional large datasets. Therefore, we try to find a possibility to assess all countries in terms of their extreme values in certain dimensions. Furthermore, we want to get a table with the numbers of &quot;boxplot outliers&quot; in each dimension. Therefore we computed a 163 x 14 matrix containing logical values 0 or 1, where 1 means observation is an outlier. Simple computations using this matrix lead among others to the number of outliers in each dimension shown in '''table 3'''.

[[Image:Datest_Outlier.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Graphic 6, Have a look on the program code and a description of its purpose by clicking on the picture.]]

[[:Image:Datest_Outlier.JPG|Graphic 6]] shows a barchart, where countries are classified according to the number of univariate extreme values or &quot;boxplot outliers&quot;. This charts yields the information that only a few countries are outliers in the boxplot sense in four dimensions, and no country has more than four extreme values. The [[:Image:Datest_Outlier.JPG| &quot;outlier program&quot;]] that generates [[:Image:Datest_Outlier.JPG|graphic 6]] furthermore provides the option to decide in how many dimensions an observation has to be a univariate outlier to be considered as &quot;multidimensional outlier&quot;. These &quot;multidimensional outliers&quot; are then colored blue and shown together with the other observations in a stardiagram (alternativlely one could also choose so called Chernoff-Flurry faces). This facilitates the decision whether those observations are actually really different from the rest of the data. This process can be repeated several times until one finds a satisfying set of outliers that shall be excluded from the further analysis (saving option available via [[:Image:Datest_Outlier.JPG| &quot;outlier program&quot;]]).

For the further analysis however, we decided not to exclude any observations, but to proceed with the whole dataset, since even four exceptionally high or low values per observation are still relatively few in comparison to a total of 13 relevant dimensions. Furthermore, the [[:Image:Datest_Outlier.JPG| outlier starplot]] shows that there seem to be different groups of countries in the data that have similar characteristics reflected by the respective shape of the stars. In case we choose to color all observations with one or more &quot;boxplot outliers&quot;, the remaining (green) observations seem to have quite similar characteristics. But the number of remaining countries is very limited and does not seem to be a representative group of countries in the world.

Nevertheless, we could check the influence of excluding certain &quot;multidimensional outliers&quot; in the further course of our analysis.

== Bivariate Analysis ==

[[Image:Datest Tubplots.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Graphic 7, All variables plotted against Tuberculosis prevalence (y-axis)]]

Now we would like to get a better impression of the relations between our variable of interest, namely the tuberculosis prevalence, and the other variables, which are according to our goal considered to be explanatory variables. One possibility to visualize the relations between all variables within a dataset would be a scatterplot. In such a graphic all variables would be plotted against each other. Since we have 13 variables of interest, this would give us a 13 x 13 display of 2-dimensional plots, which hardly allows for proper displaying on a standard computer monitor. Additionally, we have empty spaces on the diagonal as well as doubling of the same information in the upper and lower triangular. Thus, this graphic can only be used in a proper way for up to eight variables.

[[Image:Datest_Surfaceplot.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Graphic 8, Have a look on the program code by clicking on the picture.]]

Instead, we just plottet all explanatory variables against tuberculosis and display them in one window that is shown in [[:Image:Datest Tubplots.PNG|graphic 7]]. This graphic provides the required informations to derive basic assumptions about the relations within the data.

First, one can see that the majority of observations seem to be distributed in a very small area, in most cases one corner of the plot, whereas only a relatively small proportion is scattered over the whole range of the diagrams. To better visualize this, we added one dimension to plots and computed a two-dimensional density estimate of the plots. This can be seen in [[:Image:Datest_Surfaceplot.JPG|graphic 8]], which exemplary shows such a two-dimensional density estimate for &quot;tuberculosis&quot; and &quot;sanitation&quot;. This further strengthens the idea mentioned in the preceding steps of our analysis. That is, the countries can be classified into different groups according to the information/variables available. Furthermore, there seem to be different relations between the explanatory variables and tuberculosis.  These relationships are to be considered in the following steps of our analysis. Since they may differ from subgroup to subgroup, we proceed with trying to find homogeneous groups within the countries and turn to developing hypotheses on the relationships in the [[Analysis of Tuberculosis#Multivariate Analysis | section on multivariate analysis]].

== Finding Groups ==

Since we have seen many indicators for the existence of different groups, we will now try to find and interpret the groups that can be found in the data.
Before we use the statistical methods at hand, we would like to mention a common distinction for the countries around the globe. This is the separation of countries according to their &quot;level of overall development&quot; into developed countries, often used synonymously for western European countries, North America and Japan, emerging countries, like the southeast  Asian tiger states, and most of the Latin American countries, and into developing countries, formerly often described as the third world (although there is just one), since these are the poorest countries in terms of income and living standard.
Although the distinction between those three groups of countries is not really based upon data like ours, but in fact incorporates much more economical data as well as data from social sciences, one would nevertheless expect to find groups similar to the ones described above. With the statistical method of Cluster analysis, we will now try to find groups that differ from each other as clearly as possible.

==== Cluster Analysis ====
 
[[Image:Datest_Dendrogram_PCP.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Graphic 9, Have a look on the program code and a description of its purpose by clicking on the picture.]]

The aim of a cluster analysis is to construct groups with homogeneous properties out of a heterogeneous large dataset.
The methods used are usually divided into two steps: ''The choice of a proximity measure'' which checks each pair of observations (objects) for the similarity of their values. A similarity (proximity) measure is then defined to measure the closeness of the objects.
The closer they are, the more homogeneous they are. 
And ''the choice of a group-building algorithm'' which on the basis of the proximity measures the objects assigned to groups so that differences between groups become large and observations in a group become as close as possible. 

For our analysis we chose to apply the euclidean distance for our proximity measure which the squared distance between two points. But before doing so we standardized the data by dividing it through the variance because of the different scaling used for the variables.

Our algorithm is the so called Ward clustering algorithm  which joins groups that do not increase a given measure of heterogeneity too much. The aim of the Ward procedure is to unify groups such that the variation inside these groups does not increase too drastically: the resulting groups are as homogeneous as possible. We see the graphical representation of the sequence of clustering within the dendogram in [[:Image:Datest Dendrogram PCP.JPG|graphic 9]]. It displays the observations, the sequence of clusters and the distances between the clusters. The vertical axis displays the indices of the points, whereas the horizontal axis gives the distance between the clusters.

We can clearly distinguish between three groups (clusters) with relatively high homogeneity. The biggest cluster containing 108 observations on the right is representing the developing countries, the group in the middle with 37 observations stands for the emerging countries whereas the smallest group with overall 18 observations is identical to the developed countries.

Additionally we computed the PCP (Parallel Coordinate Plot) for the three cluster means to visualize the differences between those groups. The green line represents the developed countries, the red line stands for the emerging and the blue for developing countries. As we expected two clearly opposed groups can be observed. The red line (emerging countries) approaches the blue one (developed countries), which seems to be a plausible result.

To get a list of the countries included in the different clusters, run the program that you find attached to [[:Image:Datest Dendrogram PCP.JPG|graphic 9]].

== Multivariate Analysis ==

As mentioned in the section on [[Analysis of Tuberculosis#Bivariate Analysis| bivariate analysis]], different relations between Tuberculosis and the explanatory variables contained in our dataset might be supposed. It should as well be mentioned that we do neither have very sophisticated medical knowledge nor do we know the circumstances of high tuberculosis prevalence countries from our own experience. Thus, it could be difficult to understand the relations between the different variables. Nevertheless we will make some assumptions for almost every explanatory variable and see whether they hold or not. From graphic 5 of the section on [[Analysis of Tuberculosis#Bivariate Analysis| bivariate analysis]], we found the regression lines (red, solid) shown in [[:Image:Datest_Regression_all_on_Tuberculosis.JPG|graphic 11]] to be quite good approximations to the pointclouds. These relations might be explained in the following, possibly naive way.

=== Hypotheses Development ===

[[Image:Datest_Nonlinear_Regression_Tuberculosis_vs_Aids.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Graphic 10, Have a look on the program code and a description by clicking on the picture.]]

* '''Tuberculosis prevalence vs. aids related deaths'''
:: The functional form used here ([[:Image:Datest_Nonlinear_Regression_Tuberculosis_vs_Aids.JPG|graphic 10]] and [[:Image:Datest_Regression_all_on_Tuberculosis.JPG|graphic 11]]), is based on the assumption of exponentially increasing numbers of aids related deaths if tuberculosis prevalence rises. Although, both variables are mutually related, medical scientists would probably argue, that aids related deaths are influenced by tuberculosis prevalence rather than the other way around. However, one could (politically probably not entirely correct) argue, that numbers of people infected with tubercolsis decline if more people suffering from both aids and tuberculosis die. Therefore, we assume that this variable can contribute to the explanation of tuberculosis prevelance.

* '''Tuberculosis prevalence vs. malaria prevalence'''
:: There seems to be no linear relation between malaria and tuberculosis. But if we excluded some of the countries with extremely high cases of malaria, we would probably learn much more. This can easily be done with the &quot;paf&quot; command. Still, there is no signifikant influence of malaria prevalence on tuberculosis prevalence as you can see from the p-value in the following table.

&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''Tuberculosis prevalence vs. condom use to contraceptive by women'''
:: As already mentioned in our [[Analysis of Tuberculosis#Univariate Analysis| univariate analysis]] this variable is difficult to handle, since the relative usage of condoms does not seem to say anything about the frequency of condom use during sexual intercourse. If other contraceptives are not used frequently, the relative condom use ratio might be high. Thus, we did not make assumptions about the relation between these two variables. Nevertheless, it turns out that the coefficient of the condom use ratio in a simple linear regression model on tuberculosis prevalence is signifikantly different from zero.


&lt;span style=&quot;color:#ff0000;&quot;&gt;'''Note: If we refer to significance in the further analysis, we always talk about a minimum alpha of 5%! For space reasons we abstain from integrating all regression output tables.'''&lt;/span&gt;


[[Image:Datest_Regression_all_on_Tuberculosis.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Graphic 11, Have a look on the program code and a description of its purpose by clicking on the picture.]]

* '''Tuberculosis prevalence vs. access to essentiell drugs'''
:: The difficulty here is that we have classified data. Nevertheless we assume a linear relationship, which is confirmed by a significant regression coefficient. The negative correlation is obvious.

* '''Tuberculosis prevalence vs. education ratio and literacy rates'''
:: Although we will probably have heteroscedasticity, we assume a linear relationship for the whole dataset. This is also confirmed by significant regression coefficients.

* '''Tuberculosis prevalence vs. access to sanitation and clean drinking water'''
:: Again heteroscedasticity has to be taken into account. The assumption about a linear relationship is confirmed by a significant p-value.

* '''Tuberculosis prevalence vs. CO2 emissions'''
:: A plausible explanation for a relationship between CO2 emissions and tuberculosis prevalence would be a rather difficult construct. But if we consider CO2 emissions as latent factor for the general economic development and living standard, the relationship seems to make more sense. The functional form assumed and displayed in [[:Image:Datest_Regression_all_on_Tuberculosis.JPG|graphic 11]] (3rd row, first element) is justified by the assumption of negative marginal influence, i.e. for a low level of CO2/living standard the influence of a little increase in the CO2 emissions/living standard on tuberculosis prevalence is stronger and diminishes from a certain level onwards.

* '''Tuberculosis prevalence vs. internet accesses, PCs, and telephones p.c.'''
:: These three variables could be interpreted as access to information. We assume that given a low level of overall information additional information is especially valuable, take for example the information that you can get infected with tuberculosis via human fluids, a very basic information that can easily be broadcasted via the media. Therefore, information certainly has a stronger influence on tuberculosis prevalence if the overall level of available information is low. If people are already well supplied with news, additional information might just cause what we would call information overflow, i.e. they are not realized anymore. 

:: The functional form used to describe the relationship between these four variables is, for simplicity reasons, the same for all of them. The justification basically is the assumption of negative marginal influence for all variables as explained above. The functional form used here is:
:: &lt;math&gt;tub =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \cdot \frac{1}{x^{0.3}}&lt;/math&gt;
:: The p-values of the simple linear regression models for the last four (transformed) variables are also significant. And the adjusted R^2 is throughout relatively high as you can see in the output tables below. That is why we will maintain our hypotheses.

=== Multiple Linear Regression Models ===

Now, what happens if we try to put all explanatory variables into one model? Will their influence still be significant in relation to the impact of other variables?
We will try different selection processes implemented in XploRe to compute the model with the best fit, i.e. with the best adjusted &lt;math&gt; R^{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Forward Selection Model ====

The forward selection option starts from one &quot;good&quot; variable, calculates the simple linear regression and then decides stepwise for each variable if its inclusion can improve the fit of the model.

This process yields the following model as result:

&lt;math&gt;tub =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \cdot \log{(aids)} + \beta_{2} \cdot \frac {1}{tel^{-0.3}} + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

==== Backward Elimination Model and Stepwise Selection Model ====

The backward elimination process starts from the full multiple regression model and stepwise excludes variables that do not contribute much to the model fit.
The stepwise selection model in our case yields the same results as the backward elimination. Both lead to the following model:

&lt;math&gt;tub =\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \cdot \log{(aids)} + \beta_{2} \cdot san + \beta_{3} \cdot wat + \beta_{4} \cdot \frac {1}{tel^{-0.3}}\ + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

This is not a very satisfying result, since the explanatory power of the model is not substantially higher than most simple regression models. What are the reasons for the lack of fit? This question shall be addressed in our final conclusion.

== Conclusions ==

As we have seen in the course of our analysis, there are many possibilities to deepen your understanding of an unknown dataset. Although we did not really find a satisfying model that fully explains the differences in tuberculosis prevalence across the countries, we got a much better idea of the structures within the dataset. We have seen and tried to explain single bivariate relations between the tuberculosis prevalence and all other variables. Furthermore, we found quite reasonable groups in the data that could be assessed seperatly via the programs provided.

However, a multivariate analysis like a multiple regression requires more sophisticated methods. As we can easily see by looking at the correlation matrix of the whole dataset, many of the different variables are correlated with each other. This is obvious in some cases, e.g. in terms of telephone lines, internet access possibilites and personal computers. These multicollinearity issues make the multiple regression rather difficult, since numerous models with similar fits but different explanatory variables can be obtained. Thus, we should try to find a possibility to reduce the dimensions of the dataset, e.g. with a factor analysis.

Finally, we should mention again that our hypotheses are neither based on sophisticated medical expertise nor can we say anything about the developement of our data in time, which might be very helpful to derive better assumptions that could be checked with the methods presented.

Anyway, we left the reader himself with several opportunities to continue the analysis with the help of the programs provided. One could for example, use the different clusters (save them via [[:Image:Datest Dendrogram PCP.JPG| program 9]]) to repeat the outlier treatment (with [[:Image:Datest Outlier.JPG| program 6]]) or the bivariate analysis (with [[:Image:Datest Regression all on Tuberculosis.JPG| program 11]]), etc.

'''Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Justice.jpg]].''' The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about what Wikibooks includes because of [[w:United States copyright law|copyright law]], and requires that we maintain a strict [[Wikibooks:Copyright|copyright policy]]. [[:Image:Justice.jpg]] and other files you uploaded may soon be deleted unless a [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free use|rationale]] for a fair use claim is provided.

In order to upload fair use material, specific rationale must be provided as to why fair use media is necessary, and how there are no free alternatives. Images or other media that do not have such rationale will likely be deleted as a copyright violation. If the information of a fair use media component could be duplicated by a free alternative, that media may not be uploaded. Please edit image descriptions pages directly to add {{tlx|fair use rationale}}; there's no need to upload the image again. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or [[WB:HELP|ask another Wikibookian]].

See {{UserImages2}} for a complete list of your uploads which may get deleted soon.&lt;br/&gt;Thank you. [[User:MonoBot|MonoBot]] ([[User talk:MonoBot|talk]]) 00:24, 10 March 2008 (UTC)}}</text>

* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Nike.jpg]]==
 
Thanks for uploading [[:Image:Nike.jpg]]. However, the image may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status.

Please signify the copyright information on any other images you have uploaded or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Worldwide Interactivity ==
Worldwide interactivity has been simplified and made easily accessible by the internet. Ten years ago, communicating with someone in a different hemisphere was slow and costly. Now, worldwide interactivity has surpassed everyone's expectations. Originally, Marshall McLuhan, a visionary in communications, called his vision of the internet a &quot;Global Village.&quot; No one could have imagined how much of a reality that statement would become. The internet's largest most sought after products are interactive. For instance, multiple researchers confirm that dating sites and personal profiles are the most used and accessed sites on the web; thus, allowing the internet to become a large community, where quick communication is possible.  Today, people all over the world, are accessible nearly instantaneously, thanks in large part to the internet and personal blog spaces. 
&lt;br&gt;



The interactive world has even written its own language. An independent research firm confirms that four languages (English, Chinese, Spanish, and Japanese) cover 95% of the global population that uses the internet. Not only has the internet made people accessible, the communication barrier has been bridged. 
&lt;br&gt;



From eHarmony to the latest video game, people are connecting and interacting. This highway of information is changing quite rapidly; it's becoming more of a train station. As people search for information, they have begun to sit and talk with the people who are traveling on the same train. This interaction will surely grow in the coming years. Forefront technologies, such as Napster and Java-based chat outlets, were innovative at their time and paved the way for technologies that we use today. As technology develops, communication over the internet will continue to rise.

Perhaps it's just me, but the link to the wrapper script redirects to another page. The link to the wrapper is at:

If it gets fixed, a message to junkbustr at yahoo dot com would be most appreciated!

Thanks,

== Why not just several X servers? ==

I don't understand why you don't just run one real X server per video card, and make the respective user connect directly to that? Admittedly, I don't have experience with multi head setups (or much knowledge about X in general), so it will be no surprise if I'm missing something, but if this doesn't seem like a too stupid question then maybe you want to answer that in the article.

== Sigh ==

*sigh* this tutorial started out so very good... But then it all became &quot;go to this link and blindly copy the configuration files to here&quot; instead of actually having the configuration in-document and explain what is being done. The links are broken; the lower half of this tutorial is now rendered useless.
: Huh. I stand truly corrected. I just assumed everything which would follow would be useless due to the break in the chain, but just below there is a section which explains how to do everything manually. I blame it on tiredness, I suppose. Sorry, and thank you, author!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">***Note: This page is still being edited. Please enjoy the current content.

InDesign was first created as a competitor to QuarkXPress in the Print Media world. As a desktop publishing application produced by Adobe Systems, it initially had difficulty in converting users to its format. However, in 2002 InDesign was first to release a version for the Mac OS-X system. Packaged with programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat in the Adobe Creative Suite, InDesign has offered its users many high-end advantages without the high-end price.
&lt;br&gt;
This is the Basic information from Adobe's tutorials found in the InDesign Help box.
&lt;br&gt;

One document, three destinations
When you need to publish the same content in print and online, do you find yourself creating a separate document for each? Using Adobe InDesign, you can publish in a variety of different formats using a single document. As you select different output formats, InDesign adjusts its print or export settings to match the capabilities of each format.
We published a full-color events brochure on the web, as an Adobe PDF document, and in a glossy printed format. For the PDF document, we added interactivity with movies, sound files, hyperlinks, and bookmarks. On the web, we included links to related websites as well. To produce the printed brochure, we used a digital master to create a high-quality composite proof, and then handed off a print-ready PDF file to a commercial printer for in-RIP separations.

Create an interactive document.
Hyperlinks, movies, sound files, and other interactive elements enrich online content and make it easier to navigate. Using InDesign, you can add interactivity for online viewing without disrupting the quality of your printed document.
For our Adobe PDF brochure, we added rollovers to a table of contents to give readers additional information. Entries in the table of contents will also appear in Adobe Acrobat’s Bookmark pane. A short movie replaces a static graphic and animates the content. For more information, see About interactive features.

Prepare for publication.
Regardless of which publishing format you use, InDesign’s Preflight feature helps you spot problems before outputting your document. When you run the Preflight utility, InDesign checks the current document or book for problems that might affect output quality, such as missing fonts or graphics, duplicate inks, or transparent objects. Most problems, such as duplicate inks or missing files or fonts, can be fixed from within the Preflight dialog box. (See To perform a preflight check.)

Publish an interactive PDF document.
InDesign comes with a collection of Adobe PDF presets designed for different output formats, as well as a number of other options that let you tailor the PDF document to your output needs. If you included movies, sound clips, or other interactive items in your document, make sure that you select the Interactive Elements option when you export the document to PDF. Select the eBook Tags option to make sure the PDF document maintains a logical structural flow.
We created an Adobe PDF version of our brochure to include in press kits and on the event website for readers who prefer to read and print online content using Adobe Acrobat. (See Preparing a document for on-screen viewing.)

Publish an interactive web page.
You may want to use one design for a printed document but another layout on the web. InDesign’s Package For GoLive feature makes it easy to repurpose graphics and text from an InDesign document for use in Adobe GoLive web pages. With Package For GoLive, stories and graphics in InDesign can be optimized for the web, and then dragged onto a GoLive web page. You can duplicate the design of the InDesign document or match the look of a website instead.
We used Adobe GoLive to flow content from our brochure into our event website template. We used Package For GoLive’s optimization feature to convert TIFF and EPS graphics to GIF and JPEG files for viewing on the web. For the most part, we let GoLive translate text formatting to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets); however, we dragged drop caps to GoLive as graphics, since CSS doesn’t support them. For more information, see About working with InDesign and Adobe GoLive.

Prepare the document for printing.
When you print an interactive document, you can convert hyperlinks to normal text and exclude bookmarks or other interactive elements. Sound files, of course, are excluded. Movies can be omitted or replaced with high-resolution images instead. 
For the brochure, we replaced a movie by relinking the graphic frame to a high-resolution “still” taken from the original movie. We omitted interactive elements using two Adobe PDF presets designed for printed output. (See steps 6 and 7 below.)
Create a high-quality proof using a digital master.
Before printing separations, it’s a good idea to proof your document to verify bitmap image resolution, colors, and the overall page design. One way to do this is to create a digital master—a compact, reliable PDF document that you or your service provider can view, edit, and proof. 
To create a digital master, export the document as a PDF file using the High Quality Print preset. When the High Quality Print preset is selected, InDesign uses compression and downsampling to keep file sizes down; leaves colors unchanged; embeds subsets of all fonts used in the file; and prints at medium resolution to create a reasonably accurate rendition of the original document. (See About the Adobe PDF workflow.)

Hand off a print-ready PDF file for in-RIP separations.
When you hand off a file for commercial printing, you can save it as an InDesign document, a PostScript file, or a print-ready PDF. We chose to save the brochure as a print-ready PDF to prevent output problems, such as missing fonts and images, corrupt files, or PostScript compatibility problems.You create a print-ready PDF file using the Press Quality preset in InDesign.
A print-ready PDF file includes all of the information that a service provider needs to produce high-quality output on an imagesetter or platesetter: colors are converted to CMYK (with spot colors preserved); fonts are embedded in the file; and high-resolution images are either embedded or linked. Your service provider can make last-minute changes to a print-ready PDF file to create traps, impose pages, or perform other prepress tasks. (See To produce a print-ready Adobe PDF file.)

STEPS

Organizing your first document
How you set up your work area and document directly affects how efficiently you can design and produce pages. The InDesign work area is designed to help you focus on design and production, rather than on the tools. The work area is customizable so that when you first open or create a new document, everything you need is immediately visible. InDesign provides all the necessary tools to set up your documents and ensure consistency.
Preview the work area.
Open InDesign. The Control palette, toolbox, and several other palettes are displayed. The Control palette displays different options depending on the type of object you select. The toolbox contains tools for selecting, editing, and creating page elements, as well as tools that help you create and choose type, shapes, lines, and gradients.
By default, palettes are displayed in stacked groups on the right-hand side of the application window. To bring a palette into view, click the palette tab. To unstack the palettes in a group, drag the palette tab outside the group to create a floating palette. We dragged the Pages palette out of its group to make it a floating palette. (See About palettes, tools, and menus.)

Create a new document.
Choose File &gt; New &gt; Document. For Number of Pages, type a number. For documents containing more than one page, make sure that the Facing Pages option is selected so that left and right pages face each other in a double-page spread (a set of pages seen together). We selected Letter for Page Size and left other options as is. Click OK. The document window opens and displays the first page. In the Pages palette, the first page is highlighted, indicating that the page is selected. The other pages appear as sets, indicating left and right pages.
The Pages palette provides information about and control over pages, spreads, and master pages. Master pages act as a background that you can quickly apply to many pages. 

Create a new master page.
To create a unique look for secondary pages, we’ll create a new master page. Choose New Master from the Pages palette menu. For Based On Master, choose A-Master. Changes you make to the A-Master will also apply to the B-Master. If you want to change the Master page name, type a name. Click OK. In the Pages palette, double-click the new master page. Because guides help you position and align objects precisely, we’ll add some to the Master page. Choose Layout &gt; Create Guides. Specify the number of rows and columns. We have chosen four rows and three columns with a 1p0 gutter. For Fit Guides To, select Margins. Click OK.
Guides added to the master page appear on all document pages to which the master is applied. You can also add guides to master pages or document pages by simply dragging them from the rulers. In addition to guides, you can use the Grid feature in InDesign, which allows you to easily snap graphics and text frames into place.

Apply the master page to a document page.
Drag the new master page from the top half of the Pages palette to a page icon in the Pages section of the palette. A black rectangle indicates which page you have selected. After applying the master page, you will notice the letter B in the page icon. This letter indicates the master page that has been applied. All changes to a master are automatically applied to all pages that use that master.
Here are some tips for working with master pages:
Use masters for a repeating logo or artwork that appears in the same position on many pages.
Use masters for adding page numbering at the top or bottom of pages. Use the Type tool to create a text box on the master page and choose Type &gt; Insert Special Character &gt; Auto Page Number.
For best results, apply a master to a spread that contains the same number of pages.
If you place an image on a master page, that image will appear on the document pages to which the master is applied. If you click that image on a document page, the image won’t be selected. That’s because it belongs to the master page. If you want to edit or delete the image, do so from the master page. If you want to edit or delete the image on a document page, you can override the image by holding down Ctrl+Shift (Windows) or Command+Shift (Mac OS), and clicking it. (See To override master objects.)

Navigate the document.
InDesign includes a number of tools to let you navigate documents. To jump to a page, double-click a page icon in the Pages palette to jump to a page; double-click the numbers below the page icon to jump to a spread. To move from page to page, click the page icons at the bottom of the document window. Use the commands on the View menu to zoom in and out of the document, or use the Zoom tool  to focus on a specific area of the document. Use the Hand tool and scroll bars to move to different areas or pages within the document. Use shortcut keystrokes to move around quickly. (See Keys for viewing documents and document workspaces.)
You can also use the Navigator palette to navigate a document (choose Window &gt; Object &amp; Layout &gt; Navigator). Drag the Zoom slider to increase or decrease magnification. The red outline increases or decreases in size relative to the area being displayed.

Flowing and formatting text
Understand the basics of adding text to your document, and pick up a few tips along the way. In this tutorial, you’ll learn to import and flow text into your document in a set of threaded text frames. You’ll also learn how to manipulate text frames and format the text inside.
Import text.
With your InDesign document open, choose File &gt; Place. Select Show Import Options to give you control over how the file is imported, and then locate and double-click the Word, RTF, or text file. If you want to import text without formatting, select Remove Styles And Formatting From Text And Tables. If you want to keep the formatting from the imported document, select Preserve Styles And Formatting From Text And Tables, and then change the settings. For example, if imported styles from a Word document have the same name as the styles in your InDesign document, you can determine whether the Word styles or InDesign styles are used. You can even map Word styles to InDesign styles. When you’re finished, click OK. A loaded text icon  appears. Click or drag to flow text. (You’ll learn how to flow text in the next step.)
Note: If some or all of the imported text appears in InDesign with pink highlighting, the font was missing and a different font was substituted. Choose Type &gt; Find Fonts to locate the missing font.

Flow text into frames.
To create new text frames, click the loaded text icon  on the page, or drag across the area where you want the text frame to appear. If a plus sign appears in the frame’s out port, it means that not all the text fits in the frame. To place the rest of this overset text, select the frame using the Selection tool , click the out port, and then create another text frame.
Here are some tips for flowing text:
To create frames one by one, without having to click the out port, hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) when you click or drag the loaded text icon. 
To flow all text into the document, Shift-click the loaded text icon. InDesign creates additional frames and pages as needed. If you hold down Shift+Alt (Windows) or Shift+Option (Mac OS) when you click, InDesign flows the text only to the end of the last page, without creating extra pages.
When you hold the loaded text icon over an existing frame, parentheses appear around the icon . Click to flow the text into the existing frame, replacing any existing content.

Add and delete threaded text frames.
To add a frame to the thread, select the text frame using the Selection tool , and click an out port in a frame to get a loaded text cursor. Turn the page if you need to, and then click or drag to create another frame. The text flows from the frame you clicked into the new frame. To delete a frame, select it, and then press Backspace or Delete.
Don’t worry about losing text when you delete a text frame in a thread. For example, if you delete the second of three frames, the text flows from the first frame into the last. No text is lost. (See Threading text frames.)

Move and resize text frames.
To work with text frames while the Type tool is selected, try this: hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) to temporarily switch to the Selection tool. Click the frame and, with the key still held down, drag the frame to move it, or drag any edge or corner of the frame to resize it. When you release the key, the Type tool reappears.
When you resize a text frame, the type size doesn’t change (unless you use the Scale tool). If you want to change the shape of the text frame, select it using the Direct Selection tool , and then drag to change its shape. Use the Pen tool  to add points.

Change text frame options.
Select the text frame, or place the insertion point inside the text frame, and then choose Object &gt; Text Frame Options. Change the number of columns, the vertical alignment of text within the frame, or the amount of inset spacing between the text and the frame. (See To change text frame properties.)
To create columns, you can thread separate text frames side by side, or you can change the number of columns within a single frame.

Experiment with text formatting.
To change paragraph formatting options, select text or place the insertion point in the paragraph, and then click the Paragraph Formatting Controls icon  on the left side of the Control palette. To change character formatting options, select the text you want to format, and then click the Character Formatting Controls icon  on the left side of the Control palette. Additional options appear when you click the palette menu icon .
If you need to apply the same formatting to multiple paragraphs, use the Paragraph Styles palette to create and apply styles. To repeatedly use the same style to format characters within a paragraph, use the Character Styles palette.

Be creative with graphics
Using the Place command, you can easily add graphics, such as pictures and drawings, to enhance the look of any document. 
Add a graphic.
With your InDesign document open, choose File &gt; Place. Select Show Import Options to control how the file is imported. Select the file you want to add. Click the loaded graphics icon  anywhere in your document. 
When you place a graphic in an empty area, InDesign automatically creates a frame for it. If you place a Photoshop (.psd), Illustrator (.ai), or Acrobat (.pdf) file, you can determine which of the image’s layers are visible. (See Placing graphics.)

Modify a graphic.
Using the Selection tool , select a graphic and drag to a new location. To move multiple objects, using the Selection tool, select one or more objects, and then drag the graphics to a new location. 
Now let’s rotate a graphic: Select a graphic, select the Rotate tool , and select the point of origin (center point). Position the Rotate tool away from the point of origin and drag to rotate the graphic. Press Shift and drag to constrain the movement to multiples of 45°.

Resize a graphic.
Using the Selection tool, select the placed graphic. Drag one of the handles to enlarge the graphics frame bounding box (hold down Shift to maintain proportions). The content inside the frame remains the same size. With the frame selected, choose Object &gt; Fitting &gt; Fit Content to Frame (or Fit Content Proportionally to avoid skewing the image). The content is automatically resized to fit within the frame.
It’s important to understand that the content and the graphics frame are separate items, each with its own bounding box. When you dragged the handle to enlarge the graphic, you may have expected the graphic to be resized as well. Being able to modify the frame apart from the contents adds flexibility, but it may take some time to get used to it. Experiment with using the Direct Selection tool and the Selection tool to select, move, and resize the frame and its contents:
To resize the content and frame simultaneously, use the Selection tool and hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS). Add the Shift key to resize the object proportionally. (When using modifier keys, make sure you release the mouse button before releasing the modifier keys.)
To reduce the frame size and hide portions of the content, simply drag any of the handles.
To resize the content of a graphics frame, use the Direct Selection tool , select the graphic, and then drag any of the graphic frame handles. 
Crop and resize graphics using the Position tool, which is a hidden tool under the Direct Selection tool.

Combine graphics into a group.
With the Selection tool, select a graphic, hold down the Shift key, and select the other graphics. Choose Object &gt; Group. Notice that one bounding box now surrounds all the objects.
When you combine objects into a group, the objects are treated as a single unit. You can then move or transform the objects without affecting their relative positions or attributes. (See Grouping objects.)

Manage imported graphics.
Choose Window &gt; Links to open the Links palette. The Links palette maintains a list of all linked graphics or text files contained in your InDesign document. Double-click a file in the Links palette to view information related to the file, such as its modification date, size, or file type.
When you import a graphic or text file into your InDesign file, you can modify the file either in InDesign or in the program used to create the file. For example, you can select a Photoshop image you want to modify, click Edit Original  in the Links palette, and then modify and save the image. Or, if you edit the image in Photoshop, a yellow triangle in the Links palette indicates that the image has been modified. You can click Update Link  to use the most recent changes. (See About links and embedded graphics.)

Drawing lines and polygons
Adobe InDesign provides a variety of tools for creating basic geometric shapes, and additional tools for drawing freeform shapes. Follow along and learn how to use shapes, colors, gradients, and curved line segments as building blocks for artwork. 
Draw a shape.
Hold the mouse down on the Rectangle tool in the toolbox, and select the shape tool (Rectangle, Ellipse, or Polygon) you want to use. Then drag in the document window to draw the shape. Holding down the Shift key constrains its proportions; for example, you can use the Shift key with the Rectangle tool to draw a square, or with the Ellipse tool to draw a circle.
The Polygon tool  makes a great starburst. You can double-click the tool in the toolbox, specify the number of sides (we entered 25), and set a percentage for the star inset (we chose 50%).

Fill the shape with color.
Use the Selection tool to select the shape that you just drew. Click the Fill proxy in the toolbox. This tells InDesign that you want to apply color inside the shape rather than to its stroke (or outline). Then click any swatch in the Swatches palette to fill the shape with color. (If the Swatches palette isn’t showing, choose Window &gt; Swatches.)
If you don’t like any of the default colors in the Swatches palette, you can create or select a color in other ways. For example, double-click the Fill or Stroke proxy in the toolbox to display the Color Picker, or use the Eyedropper tool from the toolbox to copy colors from imported graphics. You can also add colors to the Swatches palette from any color library. (See To create a new color swatch.)

Change the shape’s stroke weight.
If the Stroke palette isn’t showing, choose Window &gt; Stroke. In the Stroke palette, type a different value in the Weight text box, and press Enter or Return to apply the change.
Although you can use a black stroke, you can also change the stroke color by clicking the Stroke box in the toolbox and selecting a different color. (See To apply color.)

Add a gradient.
Instead of using a solid color on the starburst, you can add a graduated blend between two or more colors. Choose Window &gt; Gradient to show the Gradient palette—a familiar palette if you also use Adobe Illustrator. Click the Fill box in the toolbox again, and then use the Selection tool  to select the starburst. To define the starting color of a gradient, click the leftmost color stop below the gradient bar. Drag a swatch from the Swatches palette and drop it on the color stop. To define the ending color of the gradient, click the rightmost color stop below the gradient bar, and then choose the color you like. Choose either Linear or Radial from the Type menu of the Gradient palette. Adjust color and midpoint positions. (See To create a gradient swatch.)
You can also define a gradient using the Swatches palette. 

Draw curved segments with the Pen tool.
The Pen tool draws straight lines and smooth, flowing curves; it will be familiar if you use the Pen tool in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop. To draw a simple curved segment, select the Pen tool in the toolbox, and click in a blank area on the page. Release the mouse button. Move the pointer to the right. Click and drag a line, rotating as you drag to create a curved segment. This creates an anchor point for the next segment. Click again, releasing the mouse button. Then click and drag. Notice how the two direction lines pivot together around each anchor point. If you don’t like a segment you create, choose Edit &gt; Undo. Select the Selection tool in the toolbox and click a blank area on the page to deselect the path.
As their names imply, the anchor points anchor the curved segments, and the direction lines control the direction of the curves. You can drag the direction lines or their endpoints, called direction points, to adjust the shape of the curve.

Create a shape with curves and straight lines.
Now that you’ve learned how to draw curved segments, you can combine them with straight ones to create a shape called a closed path. To control the straight lines, choose View &gt; Grids &amp; Guides &gt; Show Document Grid and View &gt; Grids &amp; Guides &gt; Snap To Document Grid. Select the Pen tool in the toolbox or type P to activate the tool. Click an intersection in the grid, and then click again to the right of the first click to create a straight line segment. Click one more time in the grid to create a second straight line segment. You’ll draw a curved line next, so instead of releasing the mouse button, drag the next line segment. To close the path, position the pointer over the first point. When you see the pointer icon appear with a small circle , click the point.

Clear steps to transparency
A soft, feathery edge on vector text and graphics adds character to your Adobe InDesign document. A shadow makes text appear to float above the surface. These effects—alone or in conjunction with blending modes and opacity settings—can create a spread with rich, three-dimensional effects.
Shown here are just a few of the many transparency effects you can use to enhance your artwork.
Draw and overlap solid-color objects.
Use any of the basic drawing tools (Ellipse, Rectangle, or Polygon) to create several basic shapes, overlapping them as you draw. Choose Window &gt; Swatches to open the Swatches palette, and then Shift-click to select all the objects you drew. Select the Fill box  in the Swatches palette to apply a fill color to the objects. (You can also select Fill in the toolbox.) Click the color you want in the Swatches palette. We used C=75, M=5, Y=100, K=0 in the example.

Apply blending modes.
Adobe InDesign offers many ways to blend colors between overlapping objects. If you’re familiar with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, you’ll recognize the blending modes. Choose Window &gt; Transparency to open the Transparency palette. With at least two objects selected, choose a blending mode from the menu at the top of the Transparency palette. Experiment by using different blending modes. (We applied Multiply, Screen, and Difference to the objects shown below.) When you’re finished, select the Selection tool  in the toolbox and click a blank area of the page to deselect the objects.

For more information about the different blending modes, see Blending mode options.
Add a drop shadow to text.
If you’re new to InDesign and want a quick type effect for your artwork, make a drop shadow. In your InDesign document, create some text. Select the Type tool  in the toolbox, draw a text frame, choose a font and type size in the Control palette (we chose Adobe Caslon Pro Bold Italic and 140 pt), and type a short word. Use the Selection tool  to select the text frame and choose Object &gt; Drop Shadow. (You can apply a drop shadow to a text frame, but not to selected text.) Select the Drop Shadow option to enable the other options, and then specify your drop shadow settings. Select the Preview option so that you can see the results in the document as you change settings. Experiment with different settings, and then click OK.
Because the object is vector-based type, you can edit the text while retaining the drop shadow effect.

Apply feathering to the margins of a graphic.
Draw or import a colored vector graphic. Select it with the Selection tool  and choose Object &gt; Feather. Select the Feather option to enable the other options, and then specify your feather settings. We used a high feather width to create a smoky effect.
Use good design judgment when applying transparency effects. For example, if you feather small type with fine strokes or serifs, the resulting text may not be legible.

Adjust the opacity of an imported graphic.
With your InDesign document open, choose File &gt; Place. Select Show Import Options to give you control over how the file is imported, and then double-click the graphic you want to import. A graphic icon  appears. Click to place the graphic. We placed some type. Place another graphic (such as our flower) on top of the first one, and enlarge it to cover the first graphic. The second graphic will be 100% opaque over the first one. With the second graphic selected, change the Opacity value in the Transparency palette so that the first graphic shows through the top graphic.
The Transparency palette is only one way to adjust transparency in imported graphics. For example, you can import objects created with existing transparency properties and compound the effect with InDesign. And, when you export to PDF 1.5 (Adobe Acrobat 6.0) or higher, transparency is preserved and fully editable.

6. Create an object style.
Choose Window &gt; Object Styles to display the Object Styles palette. Select an object to which you’ve applied transparency settings, and then choose New Object Style from the Object Styles palette menu. Click Transparency. Notice that the settings for the selected object are applied. Select (or deselect) other items that you want to appear in the style, type the style name, and click OK. You can then apply these settings to other objects in your document.
To save time, you can create object styles for text frames or graphics frames, and then apply these styles to objects in your document. (See About object styles.)



&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These notes were found at http://desktoppub.about.com/od/indesign/a/id_class.htm and detail the basics of InDesign, mostly what everything is and where it is. It describes the workface.
&lt;br&gt;
You have a Menu Bar on top, the tools and the palettes. Palettes are little windows which have specialized functions, e.g., you have got one that handles colours, one that handles paragraphs, one that handles pages, etc. By default, there is a special palette just under the Menu Bar called Control Palette. This one changes depending on what tool you are using or what you are doing while you are working with the different items of your layout.

 


You can get access to all of the functions of InDesign through the Menu Bar
 

However you will see that, as you become more proficient and faster at using InDesign, you will want to learn shortcuts so you don't have to drag your mouse around in search of the option you want. If you want to learn the shortcuts, just look next to the command you are interested in and you will see the shortcut if there is one.

If you want to open a new document go to File &gt; New &gt; Document, and, when the New Document window shows up, choose your document size and press OK.
******** New Document and Page Settings
Open a new document: File &gt; New &gt; Document. Now have a look at your New Document window. The first thing you see is the Document Preset section.You will see that in Page Size you have several page settings (letter, legal, tabloid, etc.) You can choose the size of your page from that menu or you can enter a custom size yourself.

A master page is a special page which will not print, unless you tell InDesign to do so. It's a page where you can set a basic layout and then all of the other pages that you will add to your document and which are based on that master page will look the same.

You can add or take off items from any page that is based on your master page and you can have more than one master page.

Using the Pages Palette

 

To set up Master Pages we work with the Pages palette. If you read the Work Area tutorial, you will know how to find it. So open your Pages palette now if it isn't open already.

You can see that the Pages palette is divided in two. The upper part is where your master pages are, while the lower part is where the actual pages of the documents are.

Let's have a look at the upper part.
	• 	You have a master page called A-Master 
	• 	You have a page above the A-Master called None.
	• 	If you were to drag a page from the master page to the lower part of the palette, you would get a new page based on that master.
	• 	If you drag from the page called None, you will have a totally blank page which isn't based on any master.
	• 	If you drag the page called None to the New Page button, what do you get? Surprise! You get a new master page called B-Master.
	• 	If you carry on doing that, you will get a C-Master, D-Master and so on.
	• 	You can also get a new master by clicking on the arrow on the top right of the palette to open the Pages palette menu and then choose New Master... 
	

More Ways to Add Pages
There are other ways to add pages.
	• 	Instead of dragging the master pages down to the lower part of the palette, where the normal pages are, you can either just click on the New Page button or you go to the Page palette menu and choose Insert Pages.

	• 	You can then choose the number of pages you want to select, where to put those pages (after or before which already existing page) and which master to base them on.

	• 	If you have multiple masters, and you are adding pages by clicking the New Page button instead of the Insert Pages option in the Page palette menu, the new pages will be based on the last master chosen in the Insert Pages option.

For example, let's say that you have Master A and Master B. You just went to the Insert Pages option and you have added 10 pages based on Master B.
If you now want to add another page by using the New Page button at the bottom of the Page palette, your new page will also be based on Master B.

Changing Items on Master Pages
Now let's say that you only have one master, the A-Master. You have a box for a picture in each page and the picture will be different in each page (even though it's placed in exactly the same position and that is why you have put it in your master page). If you just click on that box on any of the pages in the document, you will see that you cannot edit it (unless you are working on your master page). So what's the point? You say. Well you have several options here that allow you to make changes to all of these twin pages.
	• 	If you want to change just one item on any page that is based on a master page, press Control+Shift (Windows) or Command + Shift (Macintosh) as you select the item on the page. You can now do what you want with that item.

• If you want to be able to change all of the items on a spread, click on a spread first and then go to the menu of your Pages palette and choose Override All Master Pages Items.


BASIC WORKFACE

CONTROL PALETTE
By default the Control Palette docks at the top of the screen. Drag, float, or dock it on the bottom of the screen if you want. Palette contents change depending on the tool in use or what you are doing.

Your item measurements are in this palette. 
X and Y, are the coordinates for the box on the page. The values are important to know for precise positioning.
H and W, give the height and width of an item.
	• 	The little chain icon allows you to constrain the proportions of your object. Type a smaller W value and your H value decreases proportionally.
	• 	A broken chain,icon means that if you type a different value for W or H, the other one won't change, because the &quot;constrain proportions&quot; option is not active.

You can also change the size of any item on a page by typing a different percentage in the next two measurements. Here again, the chain icon has the same function.

To understand how the rest of the functions work on the Control Palette, just move your mouse over the icons in the palette and wait for a couple of seconds. The name of the functions will appear. Then try typing some values and see what happens to your box so you understand what they do. The control palette also allows you to change the stroke and the colour of the stroke of your black box. Some of the things that you see in the Control Palette you will see on other palettes as well. That's just a way to give you more options to do the same thing.

On a side line, if you right click on an object or anything on your page (or Control+click for Mac users) another menu will appear. That is a contextual menu, that is, a menu that changes depending on what you are clicking on, a bit like the Control Palette. The options you will get in that menu will be different from the ones of the Control Palette.
A Few Words on Contextual Menus
Contextual Menus show up when you right + click (Windows) or Control + click (Mac Os) on objects in your layout. They change depending on which object you have selected. They are very useful as they show you options that are related to what you are doing, for example the Drop Shadow option when you click on a shape or an image, and they also save you the time to go all the way up to the top of your screen to the Menu Bar.

The (Other) Palettes, Part 1
If you look at the Work Area screenshot you see that there is a floating palette and one that is docked on the right hand side of the screen. You will also notice a few tabs just above the palette on the right. These are other palettes, but they are collapsed.

You can also collapse a floating palette. If you click on the name of the palette it will only partially collapse. If you click on the top of the palette, it will collapse completely showing you only a tab with the name of the palette(s). Palettes can also be grouped together. You just need to drag one palette on top of the other and InDesign will group them together.

Palettes in InDesign are all under the Window Menu. You will find some that the palettes palettes related to type are also under the Type Menu.

 



You will find the following palettes both under the Type Menu and the Window Menu:
	• 	Character
	• 	Paragraph

These palettes are only under the Window Menu:
	• 	Align
	• 	Colour
	• 	Control (which is the same Control Palette I covered earlier)
	• 	Gradient
	• 	Info
	• 	Layers
	• 	Links
	• 	Navigator
	• 	Flattener (Window &gt; Output Preview)
	• 	Separations (Window &gt; Output Preview)
	• 	Pages
	• 	Stroke
	• 	Swatches
	• 	Tools (which I will take up later on in this lesson)
	• 	Transform
	• 	Transparency
	• 	Character Styles (Window &gt; Type &amp; Tables)
	• 	Paragraph Styles (Window &gt; Type &amp; Tables)
	• 	Table (Window &gt; Type &amp; Tables)
	• 	Text Wrap

And we obviously also have the black sheep: the Library palette, which is under File &gt; New &gt; Library.

Each palette has got its own menu. If you click on the arrow shown in illustration (below), their menu will pop up and you can then choose any of the options that are available.

TOOLS PALETTE

 

You will use this palette quite a lot. If you move the cursor of your mouse on top of each tool their name will appear.

If you use Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, you will be familiar with the little arrows on the bottom corner of some of the icons in the Tools Palette. If you click on them and keep your mouse button pressed a little menu will pop up. That menu shows you some &quot;hidden&quot; tools which you can choose from. This little menu is called flyout.

 

Now look further down in the Tools Palette. These are the swatches — you can assign colours to items on your page through these. You can see the fill colour and the stroke (outline) colour. The little arrow on the top right will allow you to swap the two colours. If you have just been working on the fill colour, you can now work on the stroke colour by clicking on the stroke colour icon or by pressing you can just press X (make sure no text is selected). This also works in reverse — if you were working on your stroke colour and now you want to work on your fill colour, click on its icon or press X. You can set your swatch to the default colours by clicking on the very small icon on the bottom left or just by pressing D (again make sure you haven't selected any text).
Just under the two bigger icons with the swatches, you will see two smaller icons. One shows a square and the other one shows a T. If you have selected the icon with the square, then the colours will be applied to boxes and objects. If you have selected the T then the colours will be applied to the type itself. As type is within boxes, you can choose to apply colour to both type and the boxes that contain them or just to one or the other.

Under those two icons there are three more. The first icon allows you to apply single colours to objects, the second one allows you to apply gradients and the third one applies &quot;no colour&quot;, i.e., if you had already applied colours to an object and then you click the on this icon, you will be taking the colour away.

The very bottom icons of the Tools palette allows you to view your document in several ways.

SETTING UP A DOCUMENT

If you have ever dealt with a word processing application you are familiar with the document page. However, desktop publishing applications differ from word processing applications as they also have a pasteboard (among other differences). The pasteboard is that white area around the page where you can put objects that you might need while you design, but that will not be printed.

You then have the margins within your document's page. Now we are getting to the harsh part ... the bleed and slug.

 

	Bleed: &quot;When any image or element on a page touches the edge of the page, extending beyond the trim edge, leaving no margin it is said to bleed. It may bleed or extend off one or more sides.&quot; 

Slug: &quot;Usually non-printing Information (such as a title and date) used to identify a document.”

You can change these settings or not have any bleeds or slug at all. If you are printing to your desktop printer you do not need any bleed allowance.

RULERS

InDesign has rulers which are located right on the top and on the left of the document's window. You have the horizontal ruler (x axis) and the vertical ruler (y axis). They they can help you to measure what you see on screen. If you don't see them you just need to go to View &gt; Show Rules. If you don't want to see them but they are turned on, you go to View &gt; Hide Rules (or press F7 to turn them on or off).

The origin of rules can be changed. There are different ways to do this:

1. Go to the top left corner of your work area where the rules start. Now click on it with your mouse and drag diagonally towards the right. When you release the mouse button, you will see that your 0, or origin of the rules, will be where you released the mouse.
2.  Go to InDesign &gt; Preferences (Mac OS) or Edit &gt; Preferences (Windows) and select Units &amp; Increments. Look at the section Ruler Units. You will see that there is a setting called Origin. You can choose between Page, Spread or Spine. While the Page and Spread option are quite obvious, the Spine option isn't really descriptive. The spine is the point where you would be binding your pages. In actual fact Adobe calls it Binding Spine.

To reset your rules as they were before, just double click on the top left corner.

SPINE
 

This is how I have made this spread.
	1 	I have opened a new document with the Facing Pages option checked. Page 1 was already there.

	2 	I then dragged the 2 pages that you see just under page 1 in the Page palette. At this point the spine was in the middle of the two pages.

	3 	I selected the two page spread and then I went to the Page palette menu and I have activated the Keep Spread Together option.

4  I then added the third page to the two pages spread to make it a three pages spread, to obtain what you see. You can add pages anywhere on the left or on the right of the original two pages spread. You can have a maximum of 10 pages in 1 spread.



Master Text Frame
All objects placed on the page or the pasteboard in a desktop publishing software application have a sometimes invisible bounding box or frame around the object - frames designed to hold text are called text frames

So let's get back to our New Document window. If you check the Master Text Frame option, you will have a text frame (or text box) on your master page. This frame will have the column and margin attributes specified in the New Document window.

More Options
Now you can click on the More Options button if you want, but that is at your own risk. I know you are tempted... Ah-ah, I caught you, you just clicked on it! Well now you saw them: here are the extra options which allow you to set bleed and slug. Well, if you need to outsource your artwork to a printshop, make sure you set these right, otherwise you will get a black eye ... from your printer!

Usually bleeds are set in a symmetrical way, that is the bleed allowance is the same on all sides. The usual bleed allowance is 3 mm or 0.125 inches, while slugs tend to be just in one place. Just enter the sizes of bleed and slugs in their respective fields and you are set to go.

MARGIN SET-UP
So how do you set up margins in InDesign? There are several ways.

The first one and the most simple one is by opening an document and then setting up the margins in the New Document window. Here it is step by step:
	1 	Go to File &gt; New &gt; Document.

2  There is a section called Margins. By default, margins in InDesign are all the same. But, didn't we just read that they shouldn't be that way? Exactly! You have paid attention. Aahh! These DTP software producers! Why do we have to teach them everything! You will have to enter different values.




PERFECT MARGINS

 

Guidelines for determining margins
Some &quot;rules of thumb&quot; governing margins can help the designer break away from the defaults while still providing all the functions required of margins.

Margin Rule of Thumb #1 Avoid using the same margins on all sides of a publication. In facing-page documents, the inside margin should be smaller than the outside margins. The bottom margin is usually larger than any other margins.

Margin Rule of Thumb #2 In publications with facing pages, the outside margin of each page should be double the inside margin.

Margin Rule of Thumb #3 For best appearance, margins should be sized progressively from smallest to largest: inside, top, outside, bottom.

Putting all these &quot;rules of thumb&quot; together might give us a set of margins such as those shown in the image at the top of the sidebar.

These proportions can produce many different looks.

EX:
Make sure that Facing Pages in your New Document window is checked.
	1 	Let's make the inside margin 12 mm (or 0.5 inches).
	2 	The outside margin is supposed to be double the inside margin. So we will type 24 mm (or 1 inch) in the outside margin.
	3 	The inside margin is also supposed to be 1/3 of the bottom margin. So we type 36 mm (or about 1.5 inches) in the bottom margin.
	4 	The top margin is 1/2 of the bottom margin, so we type 18 mm (or 0.75 inches) in the top margin.

Et voilat! You have just set up your perfect margins. Don't forget to press OK when you have finished.

Changing Margins and Defaults
Let's say you have now have your new document and you feel that you need to change the margins. You can still change them without having to open another new document. Just go to Layout &gt; Margins and Columns... A new window named (guess what?) Margins and Columns will open up and you can then change your margins from there.


COLOR

 
The illustration shows the colour palette in two different colour modes. On top is the palette in CMYK mode and the second one shows you the palette in RGB mode. You can choose which mode to use from the Colour palette's menu (which pops up when you click on the arrow on the top right of the palette, remember?). InDesign allows you to choose a third colour mode, but it is rarely needed and I won't take it up in this course. So ignore it for now.

The way you determine a colour is by either typing percentages on the left of the sliders, or by dragging the sliders with your mouse. Like for the Tools palette, you have your fill colour and your stroke colour which can be applied to objects and/or to text. You will notice that when you change a colour that way, also the colour swatches in your Tools palette will change. So you now have different ways to apply colours to your objects.
	• 	If you did not select any object and you change your colours in the Colour palette, then any object you will draw from that point on will have that colour.

	• 	To the contrary if an object was selected and then you changed your colours in your Colour palette, then the colour you made will be applied to that object only.

•   If there was an object in your layout already and you made up a colour without selecting the object, you can still apply your new colour to that object. Just select the object now, and click on on your new colour either on your Colour palette or on your Tools palette.

The Swatches Palette in InDesign CS

 

The Swatches palette goes hand in hand with the Colour palette. Let's say you have just made this nice blue that you need to use throughout the whole document. Yes you can type the percentages of that blue in your Colour palette every time you need to use it, or you can make your life easier by recording that colour into a swatch which will then go to your Swatches palette. That is the main use of the Swatches palette. You can record spot colours, CMYK colours and RGB colours. 

Gradient: 	
1 Open your Gradient palette.
2 Drag one or more colours from either the Swatches palette or the Colour palette.

      <text xml:space="preserve">MySpace is a social networking website offering an interactive, user-submitted network of friends, personal profiles, blogs, groups, photos, music and videos.  According to Alexa Internet, MySpace is currently the world's fifth most popular English-language website and the fifth most popular website in any language,[2] and the third most popular website in the United States, although it has topped the chart in various weeks[3] (it is possible that other websites have a greater number of unique visitors). The service has gradually gained more popularity than similar websites to achieve nearly 80 percent of visits to online social networking websites.[3] It has become an increasingly influential part of contemporary, popular culture, especially in English-speaking countries.



For a good but lengthy article on MySpace/Facebook, and their ability to endure, check out [http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1463&amp;CFID=6849052&amp;CFTOKEN=52907713&amp;jsessionid=a830a8d9bc1013178426]



MySpace is also a strong tool for bands and musical artists to create a following.  According to an internet topic on this subject; &quot;More than 240,000 artists of every kind -- from unsigned amateurs to international rock stars -- are using MySpace as a way to market themselves and build a fan base.&quot;  It even goes on to say that successful bands like My Chemical Romance started out and gained a lot of their success and fan base solely through Myspace.  [http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2005/05/67545]



Here is an article about the latest pursuits of MySpace. It is very interesting. Did you know that if the number of users on MySpace were turned into a world population that it would be the 11th largest country in the world? Read more here: http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/03/myspace-will-hold-presidential-primary/



Some of the differences between MySpace and Facebook are quite extreme.  A major one is spamming and advertisements.  It is impossible to log into MySpace without being horded by ads and cheesy flash games which are actually ads linking to somewhere else.  Facebook, on the other hand, has an extremely clean interface with limited ads that aren't so &quot;in your face.&quot;  Another issue with MySpace is its relentless sexual ads and other things implying sex, such as a streaming video advertisement of a girl pretending to be chatting with the user.

Another difference between the two is the ability to send mass messages/emails or not.  Facebook allows you to send out mass messages only to members of a group or event (that is if that person is an admin).  Whereas MySpace allows you to send out &quot;bulletins&quot; which is basically a message you typed out, available for everyone on your friends list to see.  This is a great networking/social tool to use to get a message out to mass amounts of people, which in effect, can be taken advantage of by spammers.

Though Facebook is extremely different than MySpace, it is getting progressively similar.  On November 6th 2007, Facebook added a new application feature to its site. It is called Facebook Ads. The Facebook Ads allow businesses to have an application on user’s pages. It has skyrocketed and made businesses able to reach more clientele. Users get the choice of adding the applications to their own profiles. With these applications people can sell, buy, trade, and even entertain.  This improvement has greatly affected and changed Facebook. 

Here is the article explaining the improvements that are taking place on Facebook. http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=52

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Canon Digital Rebel XTi.jpg|thumb|right|Canon Digital Rebel XTi]]
The Canon EOS 400D / Rebel XTi digital SLR is the successor to the best-selling EOS 350D / Rebel XT. Announced in August 2006, it combines a number of anticipated improvements along with a few genuine surprises.

Most people won’t be surprised to learn the 400D / XTi now features a larger 2.5in screen and Canon’s Picture Styles, but following the earlier EOS 30D, many equally expected the new entry-level body to employ the same sensor as its predecessor. 

But instead of re-using the 350D / XT’s 8 Megapixel sensor, Canon’s developed a brand new 10.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor for the 400D / XTi. This makes it Canon’s highest resolution digital SLR with an EF-S lens mount to date. 

In addition the EOS 400D / Rebel XTi is the first Canon digital SLR to feature a self-cleaning sensor which shakes off dust particles. Reference frames can also be tagged to images for automatic removal of more stubborn dust particles later using supplied software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Blog Searching with TECHNORATI'''

Technorati’s logo is “Who’s saying what. Right now.”  Technorati is a place on the web where a person can search any topic they wish in blog posts, in tags, and in blog directory. Right now Technorati is tracking 73.1 million blogs. According to Technorti.com, there are over 175,000 new blogs everyday and there are 1.6 million posts per day. 

In Technorati, a person can start with typing in the search bar something they are looking for. Then, after hitting 'search' in the bar below the top where it says ‘Refine results for “…”’ a person can combine forces. Basically it is a way of narrowing a person’s search.  To narrow it even further a user can search with authority.  The amount of authority depends on the value of the site the information is coming from. The choices are, any authority, a little authority, some authority, and a lot of authority. 



Another feature that Technorati offers is the ability to organize the user’s favorite blogs in one spot on the site.  In this spot, they can see who has updated their blogs to keep up with all of their favorites. In order to get this feature, a user needs to just join the site.  After joining, Technorati allows a user to type in their favorite URL’s and organize them with descriptive tags such as “college” or “health issues.”  

Technorati is a very useful Internet tool that allows a person to search in one place that is specifically about blogging.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The gurus at Adobe have been making a lot of changes for their latest Photoshop release. Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia is sure to give them even more of the market share. One of the more recent additions to the Adobe suite is Adobe Lightroom.  Lightroom was released a few weeks ago, and is great for photography pros. Lightroom offers features that are found in Photoshop, but focuses on the features that a photographer uses most commonly. The power of Lightroom is in its ability to &quot;import, select, develop, and showcase large volumes of digital images&quot;. Lightroom is a great Photoshop alternative for those not needing all the features Photoshop offers, has a reasonable price tag of around $200.

The biggest news in the Adobe world is the release of the CS3 suite.  Photoshop is the industry standard in photo editing and manipulation, with Corel coming in as a distant second.  New with the release of Photoshop CS3 is two distinct versions. Adobe now offers the standard and extended version. According to Amazon.ca the price of Photoshop CS3 (for Mac) is 772.94 US dollars, whereas CS2 is available now for $599.95. The added features of the extended version sound amazing. From the Adobe website: CS3 offers &quot;3D and motion support with the ability to edit 3D content and incorporate it into 2D compositions, paint and clone over multiple video frames, and more. Comprehensive image analysis with new image measurement and counting tools&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an amazing time in history as interactive media is opening hundreds and thousands of opportunities into every area of life. From the corporate world to the education system, there are new avenues and new ways of doing things available through this new medium. As people are being faced with this medium that was once unheard of, or at least out of reach and futuristic, there are many who may feel overwhelmed or don’t understand it.  Hopefully through this article, others will be able to get some pointers and information that will help them begin their journey into the world of interactive media. As stated on the page “A definition for interactive media,” “Any format (print, web, disc, video, audio, etc.) that is created in a way that allows for user-interaction could be called interactive media.” Now that the definition for this media has been given, one might ask, “What’s the point?” Interactive media is a powerful tool because it involves people into an environment, experience, work tool, learning tool, etc. in a way that no other media can. In a sense, it is media and technology on steroids. It can pull a person in by making the experience feel extremely real. 

As history has proven, times of crisis often produce some of the best advances in society. In some ways this could be part of the reason that interactive media exists. I believe that one of the first attempts to make movies interactive was in the 1950’s when the 3D glasses and Cinerama were introduced. This was a time that television owned the market and most people did not have a desire to watch movies. As a result, filmmakers introduced Cinerama, which involved a huge, wrap around screen that had 3 projectors feeding onto it. In many ways, this is no different from the Ai Classes college weekend recruiting project. Then, 3D films were introduced, which used 2 cameras images, color distortion, and cardboard cutout glasses to produce the feeling that the audience was physically in the place of the movie. (http://library.thinkquest.org) For a list of 3D movies that have been produced, go to http://www.3d.curtin.edu.au/3dmovies/ .

Now, interactive media has grown leaps and bounds into video games, sites like MySpace.com and Facebook.com, and emerging technologies such as the touch screen interface that Apple is in the process of producing, and virtual reality. Chris Crawford is one of the leading video game designers in today’s industry. On his site http://www.storytron.com  he has an overview that describes exactly what it is that he does and why it is so amazing. “Have you ever wanted to try to jump right into a story and speak to the people in it? Have you thought about playing the protagonist, letting your feelings and imagination steer the story in new, creative directions? 

If you have, then you’ve dreamt of interactive storytelling, and in that case, you’re not alone - from the Neverending Story to the Star Trek Holodeck, people have created countless depictions of interactive storytelling. It’s hard not to be attracted to it; an artistic medium which offers the rich emotional experience of a story, coupled with the empowerment of actually being the protagonist. We are proud to present the first successful implementation of this appealing idea: Storytronics.” 

Hopefully you are starting to get a feel for the power of interactive media. It can pull an audience in like no other tool. Imagine if you could create a advertising device that people could not resist at least looking at. People could no longer turn away because it's too real; it’s too engaging. Now it's time to dive in and explore the interactive world for yourself. Here is a list of recommended places to visit and experience some of the world's most cutting edge interactive media.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 3rd, 4th, and 5th Declension Nouns ==

We will now complete the table of nouns with the 3rd, 4th, and 5th declensions. These declensions are more difficult to work with because their nominative and accusative plural forms are identical, as are their dative and ablative plural forms. To distinguish the cases, you must use a very simple key: context. Context will tell you the meaning.

=== 3rd Declension Masculine or Feminine (each word has a set gender): ''rēx'', m. ===

3rd declension nouns &lt;!--(like the 2nd declension noun ''ager'') [not analogous at all -hieronymous85]--&gt; have two stems&lt;!-- debatable. I'll research and clarify if necessary --&gt;: The nominative and vocative singular stem and the stem used for all other cases. Both stems have to be memorized for each noun. Feminine and masculine forms are indistinguishable.


{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! 3rd Declension
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| nominative || ''rēx'' || ''rēg-ēs''
|-
| accusative || ''rēg-em'' || ''rēg-ēs''
|-
| genitive || ''rēg-is'' || ''rēg-um''
|-
| dative || ''rēg-ī'' || ''rēg-ibus''
|-
| ablative || ''rēg-e'' || ''rēg-ibus''
|}

=== 3rd Declension Neuter ''i''-stem: ''mare'' ===


{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! 3rd Declension Neuter
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| &lt;I&gt;nominative*&lt;/I&gt; || ''mare'' || ''mar-ia''
|-
| genitive || ''mar-is'' || ''mar-ium''
|-
| dative || ''mar-ī'' || ''mar-ibus''
|-
| accusative || ''mare'' || ''mar-ia''
|-
| ablative || ''mar-ī'' || ''mar-ibus''
|}

=== 4th Declension Masculine/Feminine (each word has a set gender) ''gradus'', m. ===


{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! &lt;B&gt;4th Declension&lt;/B&gt;
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| nominative || ''grad-us'' || ''grad-ūs''
|-
| accusative || ''grad-um'' || ''grad-ūs''
|-
| genitive || ''grad-ūs'' || ''grad-uum''
|-
| dative || ''grad-uī'' || ''grad-ibus''
|-
| ablative || ''grad-ū'' || ''grad-ibus''
|}

=== 4th Declension Neuter: ''cornū'' ===


{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! 4th Declension Neuter
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| nominative || ''corn-ū'' || ''corn-ua''
|-
| vocative || ''corn-ū'' || ''corn-ua''
|-
| accusative || ''corn-ū'' || ''corn-ua''
|-
| genitive || ''corn-ūs'' || ''corn-uum''
|-
| dative || ''corn-ū'' || ''corn-ibus''
|-
| ablative || ''corn-ū'' || ''corn-ibus''
|}

=== 5th Declension Masculine/Feminine (each word has a set gender; most are feminine): ''rēs'', f. ===


{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! 5th Declension Feminine/Masculine
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| nominative || ''r-ēs'' || ''r-ēs''
|-
| vocative || ''r-ēs'' || ''r-ēs''
|-
| accusative || ''r-ēm'' || ''r-ēs''
|-
| genitive || ''r-ēī'' || ''r-ērum''
|-
| dative || ''r-ēī'' || ''r-ēbus''
|-
| ablative || ''r-ē'' || ''r-ēbus''
|}

== Exercises ==

=== Exercise 1 ===

Translate the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''Hodiē militēs ad villam meī amīcī mittō. Meō amicō, Marcō Tulliō nomine, mē in Senatū maledicere placet, quā rē istum interficere volō.''

&lt;B&gt;Vocabulary:&lt;/B&gt;

*''villa -ae f.'', farmhouse
*''mittō mittere mīsī missus'', to send
*''nomen nominis n.'', name
*''maledicō -dicere -dīxī -dictum'', to insult
*''placet placēre placuit placitus'' + dative, it pleases
*''quā rē'', on account of which
*''iste ista istud'', that damn (man/woman/thing)
*''interficiō -ficere -fēcī -fectus'', to kill
*''volō velle voluī --'', to want

:For extra credit, who in the late Republic might have said such a thing?

=== Exercise 2 ===

Translate the following: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''Eheu! Mūs meum pānem mandit. Nunc nihil habeō. Me miserum!''

&lt;B&gt;Vocabulary&lt;/B&gt;:

*''mando mandere mansi mansus'', to chew on

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- END Navigation --&gt;

&lt;!-- Lesson --&gt;

This lesson is divided up into several sections. After your done you'll be ready to have your very first conversation in Uzbek. Sure, it'll be real simple—but you'll know how to greet somebody, introduce yourself, ask some polite questions, and say goodbye. If you want to do it intensive (which I'd recommend) you can do this all as one lesson. If you don't have much time the dialogues are broken up into four sections—just do one. (Eventually I think we'll merge all four tiny dialogues)

==Cultural Notes==
Uzbek families are very close-knit and Uzbeks spend a great deal of time with their family members.  The average family has four or five children, but in rural areas families with ten children or more are very common.

Most families live in private, one-story houses with a courtyard (hovli) where family members spend much of their time together.  In summer months families have their meals and relax here under grape trellises (ishkom), and often sleep outside on special structures with bedding.

Uzbek parents, especially outside the major cities, enjoy great authority.  Children are expected to help in a wide variety of household chores.  Girls are responsible for the cleanliness of the courtyard, while boys take care of its trees and flowers.

Young women usually get married between the ages of 19 and 22, and men tend to get married a few years later.  It is customary, especially in rural areas, for married sons and their wives to live with the son's parents.  If there are several sons in a family, the oldest son and his family may move out when his next younger brother gets married.

Uzbek families gather to mark many important life-cycle events.  One of the most important celebrations is the circumcision feast (sunnat toyi) for boys of pre-school age.  Other major gatherings are organized at the time of engagement and marriage of children, following the birth of a child, as part of funerals, and on the seventh day, the twentieth day, the fortieth day, and the one year anniversary of a death.  One of the Uzbeks' favorite holidays is Navroz, which is celebrated at the time of the spring equinox on March 21 or 22.  Other important holidays include the twice yearly Muslim observances (hayit) and occasions state holidays, along with September 1, which is celebrated as Uzbekistan's Independence Day.

==Grammar and Vocabulary Explanations==

The verbs ''turaman'' in the sentence ''Bu yerda ikki yil turaman'' &quot;I will stay here for two years,&quot; is in the present-future tense.  The present-future tense is formed by adding the suffix -a (after consonants) or -y (after vowels) to the stem of the verb.  To indicate person, this suffix is followed by one of the predicative suffixes -man, -san, -di; -miz, -siz, -dilar.  This tense may be translated as an English present or future:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hermione howling like a werewolf ==

Umm, no she doesn't. Hermione in the book is petrified at the thought that she might affect the past by interfering; '''you must not be seen''' is the watchword here. She is utterly horrified that Harry has had the temerity to actually cast the Patronus that saved everyone; and she would not be so scared by it if she had already done the same thing to distract Lupin. This is another of the things that is different between the movie and the books, and in this case is rather illogical in the movie portrayal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Seeds are all around you.  You can find them in many fruits, such as apples, oranges, pears, grapefruit, tangerines, strawberries, lemons.  They are also present in many vegetables, such as cucumber, squash, pumpkin, corn (use popcorn for your collection), and beans of all varieties.  Take a stroll through the produce section of a grocery store and buy some of these foods.  It is especially fun to try new and unusual fruits and vegetables.

Flowers also make seeds, so you can collect seeds from flowers that you already may have growing in your flower bed.

You can also collect various seeds in the wild, including grass seeds, milkweed, acorns (and other nuts), clover, goldenrod, etc.

Once you have exhausted these sources, go to the seed section of a store or a nursery.  This should be reserved as a last resort.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Interactive media is impacting museum exhibits around the world, especially in Washington D.C.

[[Image:Interactive_newsroom.jpg|right]]
The latest museum to incorporate interactive media is the soon-to-be opened [http://www.newseum.org] “Newseum” in Washington D.C. The Newseum is a 250,000-square-foot museum of news which offers its visitors five centuries of news history, up-to-the-second technology, and hands-on exhibits. It will feature seven levels of galleries, theaters, retail spaces, and visitor services and will gives its visitors a unique look behind the scenes of how and why news is made.

Some of its interactive features include a fully interactive newsroom, interactive news history gallery, a book and text database, and a 4-D digital theater.

The Interactive Newsroom gives museum-goers a chance to play the role of a reporter or photographer. There are touch-screen stations that provide the reporting tools and techniques needed to see what it takes to be a newspaper reporter or photographer. There are also eight “Be A Broadcaster” stations where visitors can actually pick up a microphone, step in front of a camera, and experience what it is like to be a TV broadcaster.

[[Image:News_history.jpg‎|left]]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In the News History gallery, visitors can view a timeline of the Newseum’s extensive collection of historic newspapers and magazines. Within the timeline are 10 touch-screens with games, a database of journalists, and close-up views of hundreds of publications. There are also five theaters that feature different videos on the recurring issues that confront journalists.

The Great Books gallery houses four interactive kiosks that allow visitors to zoom-in and view close-up pages of some of history’s most important texts and documents.

[[Image:Forum_theater.jpg‎|right]]
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Another very immersive form of interactive media being incorporated into the Newseum is the Forum Theater. This state-of-the-art digital theater allows visitors to feel as if they are standing next to Edward R. Murow on a London rooftop as he delivers a live radio report during World War II. They also can go undercover with Nellie Bly as she exposes horrendous conditions in a 19th century insane asylum. The theater consists of a 3-D film, theatrical special effects and motion controlled seats that take visitors on a journalistic trip through time to experience some of the world’s most dramatic news stories. The theater seats up to 535 people and is equipped for live broadcasts and programs.

The Newseum is not the only museum in Washington D.C. jumping on the interactive train though. Other museums are the Marian Koshland Science Museum [http://www.koshland-science-museum.org], the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum [http://www.ushmm.org], and the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center [http://www.jp2cc.org] just to name a few. Interactive media is not only working its way into video games and other entertainment venues, but is also being used to educate museum-goers. This is a trend that will only increase as the high-touch era continues to grow.

==Origins of this Chapter==
As the main author of the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]], I had started to put together a chapter for the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Birds|Birds]] honor.  After doing a substantial amount of work on requirement 5 (which is to identify several bird species), it occurred to me that what I had really done was made a pretty good start on a Field Guide to Birds.  I decided that it would be a good idea to move that chapter to a book in its own right, and when I tried, I found this book.  Since all of the birds I had entered were the ones with which I was familiar already, it naturally covered birds of the Eastern US.  That particular chapter in this field guide was a red link, so I just moved it all, lock, stock, and barrel.  There are a gob of moves I need to do on the subparts.  

The content for each bird presented here is done with a template called [[Template:Bird id]].  This template could still use a bit of work, but it's not too bad the way it is now.  It might be a good idea to break up the description field to cover, physical appearance, habitat, etc, but I may leave that to a more ambitious person.

I have also put together a section on Edible Wild Plants, and it seems like a few more &quot;field-guidy&quot; chapters. I will move those as I come across them as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Capillary Electrophoresis

Electrophoresis is the movement or migration of ions or solutes under the influence of an electric field. Capillary electrophoresis is the technique of performing electrophoresis in buffer-filled, narrow-bore capillaries, which normally have internal diameter from 25 to 100 μm.

 Instrumentation
The instrumentation required for CE is simple( Figure 1) The ends of a capillary are placed in separate buffer reservoirs, each containing an electrode connected to a high-voltage power supply . One of the buffer reservoirs (normally at the anode) is temporarily replaced by sample .The sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, or siphoning. Then an electric potential is applied across the capillary and the separation is performed. Separated analytes can be detected by UV-visible or fluorometric detection directly through the capillary wall near the opposite end (normally near the cathode).
Electrophoresis Theory
The separation by electrophoresis depends on differences in the migration velocity of ions or solutes through the given medium in the applied electric field. The electrophoretic migration velocity (up) of an analyte toward the electrode of opposite charge is:
up = μpE
where μp is the electrophoretic mobility and E is the electric field strength. 

The electric field strength is a function of the applied voltage divided by the total capillary length. The electrophoretic mobility is directly proportional to the ionic charge of a sample and inversely proportional to any frictional forces present in the buffer. When two species in a sample have different charges or experience different frictional forces, they will separate from one another as they migrate through a buffer solution. The frictional forces experienced by an analyte ion depend on the viscosity (η) of the medium and the size and shape of the ion.
 Accordingly, the electrophoretic mobility of an analyte at a given pH is given by:
 
where z is the net charge of the analyte and r is the Stokes radius of the analyte. 
 From equation we can see that differences in the charge-to-size ratio of analyte ions cause differences in electrophoretic mobility. Higher charge and smaller size cause greater mobility, whereas
lower charge and larger size cause lower mobility.

 Electrophoretic mobility is an indication of fastness of a given ion or solute through a given medium. It expresses the balance of electrical force ( acts in favor of motion) and the frictional force(acts against motion). Since these forces remain in a steady state during electrophoresis electrophoretic mobility is a constant for a given ion under a given set of conditions and therefore is a characteristic property for any given ion or solute. Because of differences in electrophoretic mobility, it is possible to separate mixtures of different ions and solutes by using electrophoresis.

5 Electroosmotic Flow (EOF)

In capillary electrophoresis, the velocity of migration of an analyte will also depend upon the rate of electroosmotic flow (EOF) of the buffer solution.The electroosmotic flow is the  bulk flow of liquid through the capillary when current is applied. The capillary tube used for CE is typically an uncoated fused-silica capillary tube and its internal surface has ionisable silanol groups, which readily dissociate giving the capillary wall a negative charge. Therefore, when the capillary is filled with buffer, the negatively charged capillary wall attracts positively charged ions from the buffer solution. This creates electrical double layer and a potential difference called zeta potential  close to the capillary wall (figure 2). The electrical double layer includes a rigid layer of adsorbed ions and a diffuse layer. The zeta potential decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the capillary wall surface. When a voltage is applied across the capillary, cations in the diffuse layer are free to migrate towards the cathode, dragging the bulk solution with them. At high pH the silanols are extremely ionized and makes large surface charge of the capillary wall. This increases zeta potential which in turn increases EOF. Thus EOF is very dependent on pH, being large at high pH.
 
Figure 4: Depiction of the interior of a fused-silica gel capillary in the presence of a buffer solution.

 The velocity of the electroosmotic flow, uo can be written as:
uo = μoE
where μo is the electroosmotic mobility, which is defined as:
 
where ζ is the zeta potential of the capillary wall, and ε is the relative permittivity of the buffer solution. 
The electroosmotic flow of the buffer solution is generally greater than the electrophoretic flow of the analytes and  at pH &gt;7 all analytes are carried along with the buffer solution toward the cathode, regardless of their charge. Negatively charged analytes are retained longer in the capilliary due to their conflicting electrophoretic mobilities. Therefore, the observed migration velocity of a solute is related to a combination of both its electrophoretic mobility and the EOF mobility. 
The velocity (u) of an analyte in an electric field can then be defined as:
up + uo = (μp + μo)E

Flow and dispersion
 In other separation techniques like HPLC, separations are driven by pressure and that results in frictional forces in places where the mobile phase is in contact with solid surfaces. These frictional forces cause the velocity of mobile phase close to the wall to be zero while that in the center is large resulting in a parabolic flow profile in the capillary(Figure3 ). This profile results in the solute zones being broadened as the move through the capillary, reducing the resolution of the separation. But in CE, since the driving force is EOF, the flow is flat which result much higher resolutions than comparative pressure driven equivalents. 
 
Figure 5: Flow profiles of laminar and electroosmotic flow.


The Electropherogram
The data output from CE is an electropherogram, which is a plot of migration
time vs. detector response. The detector response is usually concentration dependent,
such as UV-visible absorbance or fluorescence. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks depending on different retention times in an electropherogram. A typical electropherogram shows separation of a three components of  mixture of cationic, neutral and anionic solutes.

===Lucius ad forum it===

Sol fulget. Lucius oculos aperit. Videt uxorem suam, Octaviam. Octavia dormit. Ergo, Lucius ad forum it. 

Lucius multos amicos habet. Unus ex amicis Claudius est. Claudius semper in foro est. Claudius temptat dicere cum feminis, quod Claudius multas feminas amat. Multae feminae, tamen, Claudium non amant.

Lucius ad forum ambulat. Multos Romanos videt. Unus Romanorum ad cives orationem facit. Est Claudius!

&quot;Ecce! Ecce!&quot; dicit Lucius. Lucius vult dicere cum amico. Claudius, tamen, dicit ad turbam.

&quot;Amicus meus, Lucius&quot; dicit, &quot;hominem necavit.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;

Lucius anxius respondet, &quot;Quid dicis, amice?&quot;

Claudius est attonitus. Dicit,
&quot;Te non video, mi Luci...&quot;

Lucius respondet, &quot;hominem non necavi! Cur tanta dicis?&quot;
Claudius sussurat,

==Theory==
Gel electrophoresis (GE) is used to differentiate molecular entities depending on their physical characteristics. These defining characteristics include the size, shape, charge and isoelectric point. Isoelectric point is perhaps the most important characteristic; it is the point at which the overall electric force on the analyte is 0, and hence the point at which the analyte ceases migration within the gel. Gel electrophoresis is used as an analytical technique or as a preparatory technique to purify molecules before they are used for other methods like mass spectrometry is based on the principle that, when charged molecules are placed in an electric field, they migrate toward either the positive or negative pole depending on their charge. Since nucleic acids are negatively charged due to their phosphate groups they migrate toward the anode. Unlike nucleic acids, since proteins can have either a net positive or a net negative charge they can migrate to either of the poles depending on the charge.

The shape and charge of proteins have a dramatic affect on protein migration behavior during gel electrophoresis, especially if the protein is not denatured prior to electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) is commonly used separating proteins. PAGE can be used to purify proteins prior to other proteomics techniques or to analyze information on the mass, the charge on proteins, and/or presence of a protein. Due to these complex structures, proteins are usually denatured, or broken down to simple primary structures in the presence of a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which imparts a negative charge on proteins, and thus allows for proper migration. The quantity of SDS bound and the size of the protein are relative to each other, thus this method separates proteins mainly based on molecular weight. Two-dimensional PAGE (2-D PAGE) differentiates proteins in the first dimension by isoelectric point and in the second dimension by molecular weight. Native PAGE separates proteins by mass/charge ratio without denaturing them.

==Process==
===Gel Properties and Preparation===
Electrophoresis is usually carried out within a matrix or gel made of agarose or polyacrylamide. These gels are chemically inert, so they will interfere little with analytes.  Agarose is a polysaccharide, an extraction from seaweed. The concentration of agarose used in any particular gel can vary. As a rule, the higher the concentration of agarose in the gel, the smaller the pore size will be.

For separation of proteins, polyacrylamide (a cross-linked polymer of acrylamide) is used. To avoid inhibition of polymerization by oxygen, the liquid polyacrylamide is poured between glass plates to make gel slabs. Low concentrations of polyacrylamide or less cross linking between its component acrylamide molecules results in gels with large pores. Standard protein gels are typically composed of two layers, a topmost layer called the stacking gel, and a lower layer, which is called a resolving or separating gel. The stacking layer contains a low percentage of acylamide and low pH. The acrylamide concentration of the separating gel varies according to the samples to be run, and its pH is higher than the stacking gel. The difference in pH and acrylamide concentrations between the stacking and separating gels provides better resolution and sharper bands in the separating gel. Polyacrylamide gels have a high resolving power compared to agarose gels.{{ref|PRINCE}}

Acrylamide gels are frequently used to separate DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides, and other smaller molecules due to its less porous nature. Using different concentrations of aryclamide provides a thicker or thinner matrix. As with any gel, the concentration of the gel or unique characteristics of its composition may affect migration of analytes.

===Separation===
Gels contain wells in which to place samples, and analytes start their migration from these points. A molecular marker can be run in one or both sides of the gel for later comparison, because it will migrate through the gel with the samples once electric current is applied. The electrophoresis buffer which covers the gel provides uniform pH and provides ions to support conductivity. When an electric current is applied across the gel, the sample molecules start moving through the gel matrix at different rates, towards the cathode if positively charged, or towards the anode if negatively charged. The voltage, as well as the time allotted for a particular run, depends on the size of the gel and the type of sample being analyzed. Running the current too long may cause samples to migrate off the gel, and turning the voltage too high may damage the samples or burn the gel itself.{{ref|GEL}}

[[Image:SDSPAGE.png|thumb|right|'''SDS-PAGE autoradiography'''. The indicated proteins are present in different concentrations in the two samples.]]

===Visualization and Analysis===
It is rare that analyte fragments can be seen by the naked eye within gels, so gels must be stained to allow for analysis. Analyte fragments resolve as solid bands within the gel. A variety of stains can be used to view bands, including ethidium bromide, silver, or Commassie blue, depending on the sample. Less common stains that may be used are fluorescent dyes, zinc, and copper. Staining times can vary from a few hours to a few days, depending on the type of gel and the type of analyte. The resolution of stains can also vary.

Visualization can be done by the naked eye once staining is complete. It is often easier, however, to use ultraviolet (UV) light to provide easier visualization. This method, however, only works if the molecules being considered fluoresce under UV light.{{ref|ANIME}} Alternatively, an autoradiogram can be recorded of the gel if sample molecules contain radioactive atoms.

Analysis of bands consists of comparing those generated by the sample to those from a known protein, be it a control sample or a molecular marker (standard). Further analysis can be done by removing a piece of the gel containing a band of interest. In-gel digestion can remove the protein from the smaller gel piece and allow for direct manipulation of the analyte. Analysis of gels are often time-consuming, and it is difficult to get distinct bands because samples are rarely pure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  '''Types of Gel Electrophoresis''' ==

Gel Electrophoresis is a separation technique that is used to separate  macromolecules such as nucleic acids or proteins on the basis of size, electric charge, and other physical properties.It can be performed within one dimension(SDS-PAGE,IEF,Native -PAGE), two dimensions(2D-PAGE), or in a capillary.  Several forms of PAGE exist and can provide different types of information about the protein(s). Non denaturing PAGE, also called native PAGE, separates proteins according to their mass:charge ratio. SDS-PAGE, the most widely used electrophoresis technique, separates proteins primarily by mass. Two-dimensional PAGE (2D-PAGE) separates proteins by isoelectric point in the first dimension and by mass in the second dimension.

===One-Dimensional===

====[[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis/Types of Gel Electrophoresis/Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide|Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)]]====
This is a very common method of elctrophoresis for separating proteins by mass. The most commonly used system is also called the Laemmli method after U.K. Laemmli, who was the first to publish a paper employing SDS-PAGE in a scientific study.For more information about this technique click on the link.[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/1.Sodium_dodecyl_sulphate_polyacrylamide_gel_electrophoresis_%28SDS-PAGE%29]]

====2.Isoelectric Focusing(IEF)==== 
In Isoelectric focusing, proteins are separated by electrophoresis in a pH gradient based on their isoelectric point(pl). A pH gradient is generated in the gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel. At all pHs other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged. If they are positively charged, they will move towards the more negative end of the gel and if they are negatively charged they will move towards the more positive end of the gel. At its isoelectric point, since the protein molecule carry no net charge it accumulates or focuses into a sharp band.

===== Immobilized pH Gradeint (IPG) and IEF run=====
Immobilized pH gradients are used for IEF because the fixed pH gradients remain stable over extended run times at very high voltages. The pH gradients of IPGs are generated by means of buffering compounds that are covalently bound into polyacrylamide gels. IPGs are cast strips with plastic backing sheets and are commercially available in different pH ranges and lengths. They offer high resolution, great reproducibility, and allow high protein loads. Isoelectric focusing is run in the same solutions that are used to extract or solubalize the proteins. The IPG strips with the protein sample must be rehydrated in the rehydration/sample buffer during which protein samples are loaded into the strips. Rehydration can be active or passive. To load larger proteins active rehydration in small voltage is applied.As the sample is electrophorised, the proteins will migrate toward either the anode or cathode, depending on charge. The proteins will stop when they reach their respective pI. After the run in IEF cell, the proteins focus as bands on the strip according to their isoelectric points. The focused strips can be frozen for storage.

====3.Native-PAGE====
Native PAGE is used to separate proteins in their native states according to difference in their charge density. Native state of protein means proteins are in properly folded state, not denatured or unfolded state. There are no denaturants present in the gel and buffer in the gel maintains the protein in its native state. Many proteins are shown to be enzymatically active after separation by native PAGE. Thus, it is used for prepartion of purified and active proteins.
In native PAGE the mobility depends on both the protein's charge and its hydrodynamic size. The charge depend on the amino acid composition of the protein as well as post-translational modifications. The hydrodynamic size and mobility of native protein on the gel will vary with the nature of the conformation. Proteins with compact conformations have higher mobility and larger structures like oligomers have lower mobility.
Native PAGE can be carried out near neutral pH to avoid acid or alkaline denaturation to study conformation as well as self-association or aggregation, and the binding of other proteins or compounds. The apparatus is kept cool to minimize denaturation of proteins and proteolysis.

===[[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis/Types of Gel Electrophoresis/Two Dimensional Polyacrylamide gel Electrophoresis|Two Dimensional Polyacrylamide gel Electrophoresis(2D-PAGE)]]===
2D Electrophoresis is a technique that blends the two methods listed in One-Dimensional analyses. It is a very efficient separation technique for proteins. The protein sample is first run on an IPG strip, which after reaching completion is placed in either a horizontal or vertical SDS gel. This technique results in gels that contain spots. Each spot on the gel corresponds to a different protein. Then the gels are stained similarly as to 1D analysis. 2D Electrophoresis is widely used, and certain methods of it can be coupled with mass spectrometry in order to identify proteins.For details about the technique click on the link.[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Two_Dimensional_Polyacrylamide_gel_Electrophoresis%282D-PAGE%29]]

===[[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis/Types of Gel Electrophoresis/Differential in Gel Electrophoresis|Differential in Gel Electrophoresis(DIGE)]]===
Differential in Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) is a technique to monitor the differences in proteomic profile between cells in different functional states. This technology allows for simultaneous separation and comparison of up to three samples on one gel.For details about the technique click on the link.[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Differential_in_Gel_Electrophoresis%28DIGE%29]]

===[[Proteomics/Protein Separations- Electrophoresis/Types of Gel Electrophoresis/QPNC-PAGE|QPNC-PAGE]]===
Quantitative Preparative Native Continuous PolyAcrylamide GelElectrophoresis is a technique to isolate active or native metalloproteins (e.g., metal chaperones, prions, metal transport proteins, amyloids, metalloenzymes, metallopeptides) in biological samples and to resolve properly and improperly folded metal cofactor-containing proteins in complex protein mixtures. For details about the technique click on the link.[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/QPNC-PAGE]]

==Procedure==
In capillary electrophoresis (CE), electrophoresis is conducted inside small tubes filled with buffer, called narrow-bore capillaries. The capillaries used in the electrophoresis instrument typically have an internal diameter in the range of 25 to 100 μm.

The ends of a capillary are placed in separate buffer solutions and electrodes connected to a high-voltage power supply are placed in the buffers. One of the buffer reservoirs, usually at the anode, is replaced by sample. The sample is introduced into the capillary by capillary action, siphoning, or pressure. When an electric current is passed across the capillary, molecules are separated. Separated analytes are detected directly through the capillary wall by a UV or fluorometric detector connected near the opposite end.{{ref|CAP}}

==Flow and dispersion==
In other separation techniques like high pressure liquid chromatography, separations are driven by pressure. That results in frictional forces in places where the mobile phase is in contact with solid surfaces. These frictional forces cause the velocity of mobile phase close to the wall to be zero while the force in the center is large, resulting in a parabolic flow profile in the capillary. This profile results in solute zones being broadened as they move through the capillary, reducing the resolution of the separation. In CE, the flow is flat, which results in much higher resolution than comparative pressure driven techniques.

==Visualization==
The data output from CE is an electropherogram, which is a plot of migration time versus detector response. The response by detector is usually concentration dependent fluorescence or UV-visible absorbance. Different peaks are shown in the electropherogram for separated analytes depending on different retention times. The electropherogram shows separation peaks of cationic, anionic and neutral solutes in the mixture.

==Advantages==
CE is advantageous in many ways. The heating that takes place due to high voltage loads on slab gels can have a negative effect on the separation of the proteins, and the use of capillaries lessens said heat buildup. Also, because the gel will not need to be handled, it can allow one to use liquid polymers for separation, and can be replaced between runs. Automation is also much more possible with this technique, lessening the time it takes, and making reproducible results.

== Barchart ==

This chart shows classes of countries according to the dimensions, in which they are considered to be &quot;boxplot outliers&quot;.

== Starplot ==

This plot shows the characteristics of each observation as stars, where each axis of the star represents one variable. For simplicity they are standardized to a 0-1-scale by default settings.

== Usage of the Program ==

[[Image:Datest_Outlier1.JPG|thumb|right|250px| Observations are colored blue if outlier in more than 3 dimensions. Click on the image to see which countries.]]

With the help of this program, we tried to overcome the handicaps associated with univariate outlier treatment as it is regularily done with boxplots. Therefore we computed a 163 x 14 matrix containing logical values 0 or 1 for each observation in all relevant dimension (country- and continentcode excluded), where 1 means observation is an outlier in that dimension.

This can be used to decide in a more appropriate manner which observations should be excluded from the main analysis. That means one decides according to the number of dimensions where the countries are &quot;boxplot outliers&quot;, shown in the barchart, and confirms or refuses that decision with respect to the stardiagram.

The dataset without those outliers can optionally be saved by the program for further usage.

== Program Code ==

'''Attention!''' For repeating the computation a transformed dataset is needed! If you have not yet computated and saved the transformation, run the [[Analysis of Tuberculosis#Transformation of the Data |program for transformation]] on the wikipage [[Analysis of Tuberculosis]] first!

== Dendrogram ==

This chart is the graphical representation of the clustering algorithm. For more detailed interpretation check [[Analysis of Tuberculosis]].

== Parallel Coordinate Plot ==

This plot shows the values of the cluster means (cluster = groups found in the data) on a vertical standardized axis. For interpretation check [[Analysis of Tuberculosis]].

== Usage of the Program ==

This program provides the opportunity to compute different numbers of clusters with several distance measures and clustering algortihms. Default settings are the computation of 3 clusters, usage of the euclidean distance and the Ward clustering algorithm.
The output contains the text vectors of the the country names falling into each cluster as well as the cluster means and variances.
Furthermore, the PCP (Parallel Coordinate Plot) of cluster means is plotted to give a first insight into differences between the groups found in the data.
Finally, the cluster information can be saved to new files for ongoin analysis (clusters could, for instance, be checked for outliers with the the outlier program that can be found [[:Image:Datest_Outlier.JPG|here]]).

== Upper Graphic ==

This chart is generated by transforming the axes of the coordinate system according to a hypothetical relation between the variables. The functional form used here, is based on the assumption of exponentially increasing numbers of aids related deaths if tuberculosis prevalence is high. Although, both variables are mutually related, medical scientists would probably argue, that aids related deaths are influenced by tuberculosis prevalence rather than the other way around. So, just rotate the chart if that makes you feel more comfortable.

== Lower Graphic ==

This plot shows a nonlinear regression line, which has been calculated by using the upper setting.

This picture has been created with MD*Tech XploRe.
== Licensing ==
{{GFDL-self}}

== Graphical Elements ==

* Plots of point clouds for all &quot;dependent&quot; variables (x-axis) on tuberculosis (y-axis)
** all countries (colored crosses)
** only cluster 1 (red small dots)
* Variables colored according to all other graphics of [[Analysis of Tuberculosis]] (except: first plot, aids, usually red)
* Linear and nonlinear regression lines (red, solid) according to hypothetical relation
* Linear regression lines for cluster 1 (dashed, thin) according to hypothetical relation

== Interpretation ==

Check [[Analysis of Tuberculosis]].

== Program Usage ==

If you want to display the point clouds and regression lines of different parts of the dataset in one plot, the code has to be slightly adjusted as exemplary done for three of the twelve elements of the graphic (little red dots, dashed lines).

== Program Code ==

'''Attention!''' For repeating the computation a transformed dataset is needed! If you have not yet computated and saved the transformation, run the [[Analysis of Tuberculosis#Transformation of the Data |program for transformation]] on the wikipage [[Analysis of Tuberculosis]] first!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Calling the ambulance is not obvious==

In regards to your recent edit of [[First Aid/CPR]]: Especially since the standards concerning *when* to call have changed, it should certainly be included. Not only that, but excluding it ruins a perfectly good mnemonic. If this WikiBook is supposed to teach people how to perform CPR, then calling EMS is one of the points where candidates fail, and should be made abundantly clear. Please discuss any changes to AAAABCD --&gt; DRABC on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:First_Aid/CPR that discussion page] if you still have issues with it.

[[Spanish/Answers/¿Qué hora es?#Dialogue|Translation]] (wait until the end of the lesson).

== Telling the time ==
Telling the time is easy in Spanish, and very similar to English. You use this construction:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''Son las [hours] y [minutes]'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

So, ''Son las tres y veinte'' would mean &quot;It's twenty past three&quot;. To ask the time, you just use the question ''¿Qué hora es?'' (literally: &quot;What hour is it?&quot;). However, this only works for times up to half-past the hour. How do you say &quot;It's twenty '''to''' three&quot;, I hear you cry? For this, you have to use ''menos'' (meaning &quot;less&quot;) instead of ''y'' (''Son las cuatro menos diez'' means &quot;It's ten to four&quot;; you can also use ''para'' instead ''menos'', using the same order you use in English.

Other typical time-telling phrases are depicted in the table below.
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|El tiempo|The time|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| a.m.
| de la mañana
|-
| p.m.
| de la tarde
|-
| It's half-past [hour]
| Son las [hour] y media
|-
| It's quarter-past [hour]
| Son las [hour] y cuarto
|-
| It's quarter-to [hour]
| Son las [hour] menos cuarto/es un cuarto para las [hour]
|}

; Notes
* If there aren't any minutes, just say ''son las cinco'' (&quot;It's 5 o'clock&quot;) or ''son las once'' (&quot;It's 11 o'clock&quot;). If you want, you can also say ''en punto'' to mean &quot;o'clock&quot;.
* Remember: ''son'' means &quot;they are&quot;, so ''son las...'' only works for numbers greater than one. To say &quot;it's one o'clock&quot;, you have to say ''Es la una'' (or ''es la una en punto'').

; Examples
* ''Son las ocho''
*: It's 8 o'clock
* ''Son las nueve y media''
*: It's half-past nine
* ''Son las seis menos cuarto/es un cuarto para las seis''
*: It's quarter-to six
* ''Son las dos y veinte de la mañana''
*: It's 2:20 a.m.

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Qué hora es?#Telling the time|Go to the exercises]].

== When? ==
So, you now know how to tell the time in Spanish. Now let's use it to describe when something happens. To do this, you use ''a las'' followed by the time as described above (''a las tres'' means &quot;at 3 o'clock&quot;). But what if you don't know a specific time? What about just &quot;In the evening&quot;? Just use ''por la'', followed by one of the entries in the table (''por la noche'' means &quot;at night&quot;):
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|Los tiempos del día|The times of the day|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| Morning
| Mañana
|-
| Afternoon
| Tarde
|-
| Evening
| rowspan=2 | Noche
|-
| Night
|}

; Notes
* Since these times-of-day are all feminine, &quot;por la&quot; is the prepositional phrase used with them.

; Examples
* ''A las ocho de la mañana, tomo mi desayuno.''
*: At 8:00am, I eat breakfast.
* ''Por la tarde, le gusta ver la tele.''
*: In the evening, He likes watching TV.
* ''Por la noche, les gusta mucho beber leche.''
*: At night, they love drinking milk.

== Time-related Adverbs ==
It's all very well knowing how to say that you do things at a particular time, but what about more habitual actions? What do you do usually? Normally? Sometimes?

{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|El tiempo|The time|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| Usually
| Normalmente
|-
| Often
| A menudo
|-
| Sometimes
| A veces
|-
| rowspan=2 | Occasionally
| De vez en cuando
|-
| Ocasionalmente
|-
| Rarely
| Raramente
|-
| To use to
| Soler 
|}

; Notes
* You should notice that all the words ending in &quot;ly&quot; in English end in ''mente'' in Spanish. To turn an adjective into an adverb: take the feminine form of the adjective, then add ''mente''.
** Thus, ''normal'', ''raro'', ''ocasional'' and ''usual'' are all adjectives.
** Also, ''ruidosamente'', ''tranquilamente'', etc, are adverbs (you met ''tranquilo'' and ''ruidoso'' in [[Spanish/Lessons/¿Dónde vives?|lesson 4]]...)
* ''Soler'' is a UE stem-changing verb (''suelo, sueles, suele, solemos, soléis, suelen''), and it is followed by the infinitive (''Suelo comer queso con pan'', meaning &quot;I usually eat cheese with bread&quot;).

; Examples
* ''A veces bebemos vino tinto, pero nunca vino blanco.''
*: Sometimes, we drink red wine, but never white wine.
* ''Suelo vivir en pisos; vivir en una casa es muy difícil.''
*: I usually live in flats; living in a house is really difficult.
* ''De vez en cuando juego al ajedrez, pero normalmente practico judo.''
*: Sometimes I play chess, but usually I do judo.

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Qué hora es?#Time-related adverbs|Go to the exercises]].

== Reflexive verbs ==
Reflexive verbs are verbs where the subject and object are the same. &quot;To wash oneself&quot; or &quot;to get oneself up&quot;. In Spanish, we do this by using a '''reflexive pronoun''' before the verb. We've already met these relfexive pronouns, along with a reflexive verb in the first lesson: ''llamarse'' (&quot;to call oneself&quot;). So, here are the reflexive pronouns:
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|Reflexive pronouns|Pronombres reflexivos|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| Myself
| Me
|-
| Yourself
| Te
|-
| Himself/Herself/Itself
| Se
|-
| Ourselves
| Nos
|-
| Yourselves
| Os
|-
| Themselves
| Se
|}

So, here is an example, using the verb ''lavarse'' (&quot;to wash oneself&quot;):
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Verb|Lavarse|To wash oneself|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| I wash myself
| Me lavo
|-
| You wash yourself
| Te lavas
|-
| He/she/it washes himself/herself/itself
| Se lava
|-
| We wash ourselves
| Nos lavamos
|-
| You wash yourselves
| Os laváis
|-
| They wash themselves
| Se lavan
|}

So, now that you know how to conjugate them, it'd be useful to give you some examples:
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|Relfexive verbs|Verbos reflexivos|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| To get (oneself) up
| Levantarse
|-
| To shower (oneself)
| Ducharse
|-
| To bathe (oneself)
| Bañarse
|-
| To comb one's hair
| Peinarse
|-
| To put one's make-up on
| Maquillarse
|-
| To relax (oneself)
| Relajarse
|}

; Notes
* These are ''very'' similar to the indirect object pronouns used with ''gustar''. Make sure you don't get them mixed up.
* When in the infinitive, the reflexive pronoun goes on the end of the verb as a suffix. For example, ''me gusta ducharme'' means &quot;I like showering&quot;.

; Examples
* ''Por la mañana, me maquillo y me peino.''
*: In the morning, I put my make-up on and comb my hair.
* ''¿Cuándo te bañas?''
*: When do you bathe?
* ''A las ocho de la mañana, nos levantamos.''
*: At 8am, we get up.
* ''Nunca nos bañamos por la mañana; nos gusta ducharnos.''
*: We never have a bath in the morning; we like to have a shower.
* ''Me encanta bañarme por la noche - es muy tranquilo.''
*: I love having a bath in the evening - it's very quiet.
* ''A veces se ducha por la mañana, pero normalmente le gusta bañarse por la tarde.''
*: Sometimes, he has a shower in the morning, but usually he likes to have a bath in the afternoon.
* ''A las nueve de la tarde me gusta relajarme. Normalmente bebo vino.''
*: At 9pm I like to relax. Usually, I drink wine.

== The Simple Future tense ==
Expressing what you're going to do in the future is simple in Spanish, and the same as in English. You use this construction:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''[Ir] a [infinitive]'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Let's look at this more closely. First, you must conjugate the (sadly irregular) verb ''ir'' (meaning &quot;to go&quot;), followed by ''a'' (meaning &quot;to&quot;). Then you have the infinitive of the verb you are going to do. So, ''voy a comer'' means &quot;I'm going to eat&quot;. It's as simple as that!

''Ir'' is conjugated thus:
{| {{Spanish/Table Header|Verb|Ir|To go|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| I go
| Voy
|-
| You go
| Vas
|-
| He/She/It goes
| Va
|-
| We go
| Vamos
|-
| You all go
| Vais
|-
| They go
| Van
|}

; Notes
* For reflexive verbs, you have two options for where to put the reflexive pronoun. You can either have it before ''ir'' (''me voy a bañar'', meaning &quot;I'm going to have a bath&quot;) or as a suffix of the infinitive (''voy a bañarme'', meaning &quot;I'm going to have a bath&quot;). It doesn't matter which you choose.

; Examples
* ''Voy a cenar a las ocho''
*: I'm going to have dinner at 8:00.
* ''¿Vas a jugar al fútbol con Paulo?''
*: Are you going to play football with Paulo?
* ''Va a ducharse por la tarde.''
*: She's going to have a shower in the evening.
* ''Vamos a ir a Francia; nos vamos a relajar.''
*: We're going to go to France; We're going to relax.
* ''Por la noche, van a jugar al ajedrez.''
*: At night, they're going to play chess.

== In the future... ==
Now that we know how to express future actions, it'd be great to be able to say when we're going to do them. Here are a few key expressions for saying when something is going to happen.
{| {{Spanish/Table Header|Vocabulary|In the future...|En el futuro...|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| Tomorrow
| Mañana
|-
| Tomorrow morning
| Mañana por la mañana
|-
| The day after tomorrow
| Pasado mañana
|-
| rowspan=2 | Next week
| La semana que viene
|-
| La semana próxima
|-
| rowspan=2 | Next month
| El mes que viene
|-
| El mes próximo
|-
| rowspan=2 | Next year
| El año que viene
|-
| El año próximo
|-
| In the future
| En el futuro
|-
|}
; Notes

* Notice ''viene'' in some of the phrases. This is from the E=&gt;IE stem-changing verb ''venir'', meaning &quot;to come&quot;. So, literally, these phrases mean &quot;the coming week&quot; (''la semana que viene'') or &quot;the coming year&quot; (''el año que viene'').

* You may have already noticed that the word ''mañana'' translates as both ''tomorrow'' and ''morning''. ''Mañana por la mañana'' means &quot;tomorrow morning&quot;. In the same vein, ''mañana por la tarde'' means &quot;tomorrow afternoon&quot; and ''mañana por la noche'' means &quot;tomorrow night&quot;.

; Examples

* ''Mañana por la tarde, voy a jugar al tenis.''
*: Tomorrow afternoon, I'm going to play tennis.
* ''El año que viene, vamos a ir a Irlanda.''
*: Next year, we're going to go to Ireland.
* ''En el futuro, me gustaría vivir en el campo.''
*: In the future, I would like to live in the countryside.
* ''¿Vas a tener ocho años el mes que viene?''
*: Are you going to be eight years-old next month?
* ''¿Vamos a cenar a las siete y media la semana próxima?''
*: Are we going to have dinner at 7:30 next week?
* ''Las mujeres van a vivir en un piso en noviembre.''
*: The women are going to live in a flat in November.

== Holidays ==
Grab your swimming trunks: you're off to the south coast of Spain!

=== Journey ===
So, when, where and how are you going to go? Look at the following phrase, explained below.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''El año próximo, voy a ir a España en avión.'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
This is made up of various parts:
* Firstly, we have the time expression.
* Then, ''ir'' (&quot;to go&quot;) in the simple future tense.
* Then ''a España'', meaning &quot;to Spain&quot; - the location.
* Then ''en avión'', meaning ''by aeroplane''. Literally, this means &quot;in aeroplane&quot;, as ''en'' means &quot;in&quot;.

You have all of the vocabulary here, except for the modes of transport, some of which are below.

*: Are you going to go to Germany by car?
* ''¿Cómo vamos a ir a Francia? ¿En autocar?''
*: How are we going to go to France? By coach?
* ''Normalmente, voy en avión, pero el mes que viene, voy a ir en tren.''
*: Normally, I go by aeroplane, but next month, I'm going to go by train.
* ''Van a ir a Rusia en avión.''
*: They're going to go to Russia by plane.

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Dónde vas a ir?#Journey|Go to the exercises]].

=== For how long? ===
To say how long you're going to spend somewhere (or doing something), you use the verb ''pasar'' (meaning &quot;to spend&quot;, as in time). It is a perfectly regular verb (''paso, pasas, pasa, pasamos, pasáis, pasan''). You would then follow it by a timespan (''pasamos dos semanas en Irlanda'' means &quot;we spend two weeks in Ireland&quot;). 

To ask how long someone else is going to spend somewhere, you use ''cuánto tiempo'' (&quot;how much time&quot;) followed by ''pasar''. ''¿Cuánto tiempo van a pasar en el Reino Unido?'' means &quot;How long are they going to spend in the UK?&quot;.

; Examples
* ''Vais a pasar un mes en Méjico.''
*: You're all going to spend a month in Mexico.
* ''Normalmente, ¿cuánto tiempo pasas en Canadá?''
*: Normally, how much time do you spend in Canada?
* ''¿Dónde voy a pasar el mes que viene? ¿En Nueva Zelanda?''
*: Where am I going to spend the next month? New Zealand?

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Dónde vas a ir?#For how long?|Go to the exercises]].

=== Accommodation ===
To say &quot;to stay&quot; in Spanish, you use the reflexive verb ''alojarse'', which is regular (''me alojo, te alojas, se aloja, nos alojamos, os alojáis, se alojan''). Then, you use ''en'' (meaning &quot;in&quot;), then the type of accommodation, as shown in the table below.

However, I hear you cry, what if you're already in Spain? How do you ask for accommodation? Below are a few useful phrases for asking for accommodation...


* ''¿Tiene cuartos libres?'' ''(formal, if you don't know the person you are talking to. Otherwise is &quot;¿Tienes...?&quot;)''
*: Do you have any free rooms?
* ''¿Cuánto cobra por noche?''
*: How much does it cost per night?
* ''¿Puedes recomendarme un hotel barato?''
*: Can you recommend a cheap hotel?
* ''¿Se puede fumar en el cuarto?''
*: Can you smoke in the room?

{| {{Spanish/Table Header|Vocabulary|Alojamiento|Accommodation|2}}
! Inglés

|-
| A single room
| Una habitación individual
|-
| A double room
| Una habitación doble
|-
| A family room

|-
| A hotel
| Un hotel
|-
| A youth hostel
| Un albergue juvenil
|-
| A villa
| Un chalet
|-
| A camp site
| Un cámping
|}

; Notes
* A &quot;camp site&quot; is ''un cámping'' (remember the accent), &quot;to go camping&quot; is ''ir de cámping'' and &quot;a tent&quot; is ''una tienda''.
* When in plural, ''habitación'' loses the accent (''una habitación, dos habitaciones'').

; Examples
* ''El año que viene, vamos a ir de cámping a Francia.''
*: Next year, we're going to go camping in France.
* ''La semana próxima, voy a pasar un día en un albergue juvenil.''
*: Next week, I'm going to spend a day in a youth hostel.
* ''Normalmente, cuando van a España, se alojan en un chalet, pero el año próximo, van a alojarse en un hotel.''
*: Normally, when they go to Spain, they stay in a villa, but next year, they're going to stay in a hotel.
* ''¿Tiene habitaciones dobles libres?''
*: Do you have any free double rooms?
* ''¿Cuánto cobra por noche en un habitación individual? ¿Se puede fumar allí?''
*: How much does a single room cost per night? Are you allowed to smoke there?
* ''Puedes recomendarme un hotel barato que tiene habitaciones familares libres?''
*: Can you recommend a cheap hotel that has free family rooms?

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Dónde vas a ir?#Accommodation|Go to the exercises]].

=== Activities ===
Right. So you've arrived and unpacked. What now? How are you going to spend your time? Obviously, you could ''jugar al futból''  (&quot;play football&quot;) or ''beber vino'' (&quot;drink wine&quot;), but clearly there are more activities than just these...

{| width=100% style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
| [[Image:Photographer.jpg|100px|to take photos]] || [[Image:Discotheque in Berlin.jpg|100px|to go clubbing]] || [[Image:Sunbath.jpg|100px|to sunbathe]] || [[Image:Ballroom dance exhibition.jpg|50px|to dance]] || [[Image:Swimming.breaststroke.arp.750pix.jpg|100px|to swim]]
|-
| Sacar fotos || Irse de juerga || Tomar el sol || Bailar || Nadar
|}

What about more general things? Why do you want to go there? What do you want to get out of the trip? To say &quot;in order to&quot;, you use ''para'' (meaning &quot;for&quot;), followed by the infinitive.
{| {{Spanish/Table Header|Vocabulary|¿Porqué vas allí?|Why go there?|2}}
! Español
! Inglés
|-
| Experimentar una cultura diferente
| To experience a different culture
|-
| Probar la comida nativa
| To try the local food
|-
| Aprender el idioma
| To learn the language
|}

; Notes
* There are quite a few new verbs here. Luckily, most are regular...
** ''Sacar'' is regular (''saco, sacas, saca, sacamos, sacáis, sacan'').
** ''Tomar'' is regular (''tomo, tomas, toma, tomamos, tomáis, toman'').
** ''Irse'' is explained in more detail below.
** ''Bailar'' is regular (''bailo, bailas, baila, bailamos, bailáis, bailan'').
** ''Nadar'' is regular (''nado, nadas, nada, nadamos, nadáis, nadan'').
** ''Experimentar'' is regular (''experimento, experimentas, experimenta, experimentamos, experimentáis, experimentan'').
** ''Probar'' is an O=&gt;UE stem-changing verb (''pruebo, pruebas, prueba, probamos, probáis, prueban'').
** ''Aprender'' is regular (''aprendo, aprendes, aprende, aprendemos, aprendéis, aprenden'').
* ''Irse'' is quite complicated. It's the same ''ir'' as described above (''voy, vas, va, vamos, vais, van''), but the ''se'' means that it's reflexive too, so it uses the reflexive pronouns learnt last lesson. Thus, it's conjugated: ''me voy, te vas, se va, nos vamos, os vais, se van''.
* With the nouns mentioned here, most of the genders are obvious. However, watch out for ''idioma'' and ''foto'', since they have the opposite genders to what you would expect. ''Idioma'' is masculine and ''Foto'' is feminine.
* Obviously, ''nativo'' and ''diferente'' are adjectives. Another useful adjective to use in these phrases is ''nuevo'', meaning &quot;new&quot;.

; Examples
* ''El mes próximo, voy a ir a Ibiza para irme de juerga.''
*: Next month, I'm going to go to Ibiza to go clubbing.
* ''Cuando esté en Francia, puedo relajarme - me encanta nadar y tomar el sol.''
*: When in France, I can relax - I love swimming and sunbathing.
* ''¿Por qué te gustaría ir a España? ¿Para aprender el idioma?''
*: Why would you like to go to Spain? To learn the language?
* ''Van a ir a Grecia en noviembre. Les gusta probar comidas nuevas y experimentar culturas diferentes.''
*: They're going to go to Greece in November. They like trying new foods and experiencing different cultures.
* ''Cuando vamos a Inglaterra, nunca sacamos fotos buenas.''
*: When we go to England, we never take good photos.
* ''¿Os gusta bailar e iros de juerga?''
*: Do you all like dancing and going clubbing? 

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Dónde vas a ir?#Activities|Go to the exercises]].

== Stem-changing Verbs ==
The second type of irregular verb is another '''stem-changing verb'''. This time, the ''e'' changes to ''ie'' in the &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;he/she/it&quot; and &quot;they&quot; forms. An example (''querer'', meaning &quot;to want&quot;) is written in the table below.

{| {{Spanish/Table Header|Verb|Querer|To want|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| I
| Qu'''ie'''ro
|-
| You
| Qu'''ie'''res
|-
| He/She/It
| Qu'''ie'''re
|-
| We
| Queremos
|-
| You all
| Queréis
|-
| They
| Qu'''ie'''ren
|}

; Other verbs that follow this pattern
* ''entender'' (&quot;to understand&quot;): ''entiendo, entiendes, entiende, entendemos, entendéis, entienden''.
* ''empezar'' (&quot;to start&quot;): ''empiezo, empiezas, empieza, empezamos, empezáis, empiezan''.
* ''preferir'' (&quot;to prefer&quot;): ''prefiero, prefieres, prefiere, preferimos, preferís, prefieren''.
* ''pensar'' (&quot;to think&quot;): ''pienso, piensas, piensa, pensamos, pensáis, piensan''.

; Notes
* ''Querer'' can be followed by the infinitive (''quiero empezar'' means &quot;I want to start&quot;).
* Remember ''tener''? Well, that is a stem changing verb too: ''tengo, tienes, tiene, tenemos, tenéis, tienen''!
* ''Pensar'' is normally followed by ''que'', meaning &quot;to think that&quot;.

; Examples
* ''Quiero almorzar a las dos menos cuarto.''
*: I want to have lunch at 1:45.
* ''Usualmente, vamos a Rusia en noviembre, pero Juan prefiere ir a España: quiere aprender el idioma.''
*: Usually, we go to Russia en november, but Juan prefers going to Spain; he wants to learn the language.
* ''Pasado mañana, vais a cenar en el hotel. ¿Entendéis?''
*: The day after tomorrow, you're going to dine in the hotel. Do you all understand?
* ''Cuando voy a Nueva Zelanda, quiero alojarme en un albergue juvenil, pero Santiago prefiere los chaletes.
*: When I go to New Zealand, I want to stay in a youth hostel, but Santiago prefers villas.
* ''Entiendo que se puede fumar en las habitaciones individuales, ¿no?''
*: I understand you can smoke in the single rooms, right?
* ''¿Piensas que las mujeres van a ser amables?''
*: Do you think the women are going to be nice?

== Jobs and occupations ==
In Spanish, to say someone's job, you use ''ser'' (&quot;to be&quot;), followed by the name of the job (some of which are given below). You use no articles - &quot;I am dentist&quot; (''Soy dentista''), rather than &quot;I am a dentist&quot; like in English. To ask what someone else does for a living, you use the phrase ''¿Cuál es tu trabajo?'' (the name of this lesson).

So, some jobs:
{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|Trabajos|Jobs|2}}

|-
| Electrician
| Electricista
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Plumber

|}

; Notes
* For some of the above jobs, there are two options: one for males and one for females. For ''electricista'', ''dentista'', and ''albañil'', there is no difference between the genders. Even men can be ''dentistas''. The same applies to any noun ending with ''-ista'', except ''modisto''/''modista'' (fashion designer).
* ''Fontanero'' is used mostly in Spain and a few other countries, with most other regions using ''plomero''.

; Examples
* ''Es dentista.''
*: He's a dentist.
* ''¿Vas a ser médico?''
*: Are you going to be a doctor?
* ''Quiero ser abogada, pero cuesta mucho.''
*: I want to be a lawyer, but it costs a lot.
* ''Son profesores de español, así que hablan español muy bien.''
*: They're Spanish teachers so they speak Spanish really well.
* ''¿Cuál es tu trabajo? ¿Eres electricista?''
*: What do you work as? Are you an electrician?

== A Few Important Words ==
At this point, we really need to go through a few important words that have been overlooked in previous lessons, haven't really got a home, or have generally not got much air-time. These are really important, and immediately raise your level of Spanish if you use them.

{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|Palabritas|Little words|2}}

|-
| A lot
| Mucho
|-
| That

|-
| How...!

|-
| Currently

|-
| Always

|}

; Notes
* ''Demasiado'' means &quot;too&quot; as in &quot;I am too nice&quot; (''Soy demasiado amable''). It also means &quot;too much&quot; or &quot;too many&quot;, as in &quot;It costs too much&quot; (''Cuesta demasiado'') or &quot;It has too many rooms&quot; (''Tiene demasiadas habitaciones''). When it's used as a sort of adjective, it has to agree with the noun.
* ''Para'', in the sense &quot;in order to&quot; is always followed by the infinitive. ''Voy a ir a Francia para relajarme'' means &quot;I'm going to France in order to relax&quot;.
* ''Mucho'' means &quot;a lot&quot; (&quot;It has a lot of rooms&quot; - ''tiene muchas habitaciones''), but also &quot;many&quot; (&quot;I live in many different houses&quot; - ''vivo en muchas casas diferentes''). Like ''demasiado'', it has to agree with the noun it describes.
* ''Qué'' means &quot;how&quot; only in the sense of &quot;How fantastic!&quot;, ''¡Qué fantástico!''. ''Cómo'' is the question word meaning &quot;how&quot;.
* Don't confuse ''actualmente'' with &quot;actually&quot;. It means ''currently''.

; Examples
* ''¿Por qué vas a Canadá? ¿Para aprender el idioma?''
*: Why are you going to Canada? In order to learn the language?
* ''Vivo en una casa adosada en Nueva Zelanda que tiene muchas habitaciones.''
*: I live in a terrace in New Zealand that has many rooms.
* ''¿Qué vas a comer ahora?''
*: What are you going to eat now?
* ''Normalmente, quiere almorzar a la una menos cuarto, pero hoy, quiere comer a las dos.''
*: Normally, he wants to have lunch at quarter to one, but today, he wants to eat at two.''
* ''¿Van a jugar al tenis? ¡Qué fatal!''
*: They're going to play tennis? How awful!
* ''Siempre ceno a las siete de la tarde.''
*: I always dine at 7pm.

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Cuál es tu trabajo?#A Few Important Words|Go to the exercises]].

== Workplaces ==
As well as '''what''' your job is, it would be undoubtedly useful to be able to say '''where''' you work. A shop? An office? A factory?

To do this, you use the regular verb ''trabajar'' (trabajo, trabajas, trabaja, trabajamos, trabajáis, trabajan), then our friend ''en'' (meaning &quot;in&quot;), then one of the options from this table, or any other building or firm.

Another important little phrase to mention here is ''ganar dinero'', meaning &quot;to earn money&quot;. It's regular, so is conjugated ''gano dinero, ganas dinero, gana dinero, ganamos dinero, ganáis dinero, ganan dinero''.

; Notes
* As part of this phrase, you can also use a company name (''Trabajo en Tesco'' meaning &quot;I work at Tesco&quot;), or even a country or place name (''¿Trabajas en Alemania?'' meaning &quot;Do you work in Germany?&quot;).

; Examples
* ''Trabajamos en un taller mecánico en España.''
*: We work in a garage in Spain.
* ''Trabajo en una tienda que se llama Woolworths.''
*: I work in a shop called Woolworths.
* ''¿Dónde trabajas? ¿En un colegio? ¿Eres profesor?''
*: Where do you work? In a school? Are you a teacher?
* ''Actualmente trabajo en una fábrica para ganar dinero para poder ir a Alemania. Alemania es fantástica.''
*: I'm currently working in a factory, in order to earn money, so that I can go to Germany. Germany is fantastic.
* ''Trabajan en una oficina, pero prefieren trabajar en restaurantes.''
*: They work in an office, but they prefer working in restuarants.

[[Spanish/Exercises/¿Cuál es tu trabajo?#Workplaces|Go to the exercises]].

== The Future Tense ==
For the past two lessons, we have been using the phrase ''ir a'' to refer to the future. Now, there is a real future tense in Spanish, which is formed by changing the verb itself, and is translated as &quot;will&quot;. It is formed thus:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''[future stem][ending]'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Let's explain this:
* The future stem is a form of the verb. Luckily for us, in most cases, it's the same as the infinitive. So, for ''hablar'' (meaning &quot;to talk&quot;), the future stem is simply ''hablar''.
* The endings are shown in the table below. You add them to the future stem as suffixes.

{| {{User:Celestianpower/Spanish table|Vocabulary|Suffixes|Sufijos|2}}
! Inglés
! Español
|-
| I
| é
|-
| You
| ás
|-
| He/She/It
| á
|-
| We
| emos
|-
| You all
| éis
|-
| They
| án
|}

; Notes
* Some verbs have irregular future stems. Assume a verb is regular unless you know otherwise. Of the verbs you have learned so far, this only applies to three:
*: ''Tener'' (&quot;to have&quot;): ''tendré, tendrás, tendrá, tendremos, tendréis, tendrán''
*: ''Poder'' (&quot;to be able to&quot;): ''podré, podrás, podrá, podremos, podréis, podrán''
*: ''Querer'' (&quot;to want&quot;): ''querré, querrás, querrá, querremos, querréis, querrán''

; Examples
* ''Comeré una manzana.''
*: I will eat an apple.
* ''Pasado mañana, ¿irás a las tiendas?''
*: The day after tomorrow, will you go to the shops?
* ''Será fontanera.''
*: She will be a plumber.
* ''El mes que viene, tendré ochenta años.''
*: Next month, I will be 80.
* ''La semana próxima, podréis hablar el español bien.''
*: Next week, you will be able to speak Spanish well.
* ''El año próximo, vivirán en una casa nueva.''
*: Next year, they will live in a new house.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Directions==
The following items should be included in this section: The Hypothetico-deductive (scientific)method, types of psychological research methods, research designs, sampling, reliability, validity, and triangulation.

==Content==
===Research Methods===
Research into mind can be traced back to Ancient Greece.  However, empirical psychological research has its roots in investigations into cognitive functions such as introspection and memory.  While early psychological researchers attempted to bring the same standards of rigor and control to their investigations as physical scientists enjoy, psychological research poses unique obstacles.  Psychological research investigates mind.  Only recently the contents of the mind become observable since the advent of neuro-imaging technologies such as  EEGs, PET scans, and fMRIs, thus early psychological research was focused on disagreements between different schools or generations of researchers that used varied approaches toward their investigations into the invisible mind.  For example, cognitive researchers rely on inferences made from activities aimed at employing cognitive functions such as memory as opposed to examining how or where actual memories are laid down.  Conversely Behaviorist researchers employed a more empirically rigorous method seeking only to make generalizations about phenomena that were directly observable and replicable in controlled settings.
====Scientific Method====
Contemporary psychological research is derived from these disparate traditions and perspectives.  It utilizes the hypothetico-deductive or scientific method: 

1. observation and data gathering 

2. inference of generalizations 

3. construction of explanatory theories 

4. deduction of hypothesis to test theories 

5. hypothesis testing 

6. support or challenges to existing theories and commensurate adjustments.  
====Theories and Hypothesis====
Two key steps, theory construction and hypothesis deduction/testing pose special problems for researchers.  Theories are sets of related generalizations explaining a specific mental phenomena e.g. schema and memory organization and hypotheses are specific predictions for research investigations.  These steps are derived from empirical data, but are heavily influenced by an individual researcher’s perspective.  Thus, researchers seek to clearly articulate operational definitions in an effort to make their research easily replicable.  Additionally, controls are implemented to ensure credibility of results and subsequent conclusions.  Finally, published research contributing to knowledge in the discipline is peer reviewed and usually rigorously scrutinized.  Psychological research can take many forms ranging from: controlled laboratory true experiments (involving the manipulation of independent variables and controls for confounding variables) to field research (involving deliberate manipulation of independent variables in natural uncontrolled environments) to naturalistic/quasi experimental method (involving observation and analysis of independent variables changed by natural incidence).  No matter which research method is employed, controls are carefully implemented to ensure the credibility of research.  Key issues surrounding controls are:  '''research design''', '''sampling''', '''reliability''' and '''validity'''.

===Design===
	The underlying structure of an investigation.  It involves how psychologists use subjects/participants in their experiments.  The three most common designs are:  

1.'''Repeated Measures''': using the same subjects in the experimental and control conditions    

2.'''Independent Measures''' :using different subjects/participants in the experimental and control conditions 

3. '''Matched Pairs''' :using different subjects/participants in the experimental and control conditions with each sample having similar characteristics.


===Sampling===
	The process of selecting participants/subjects to examine derived from a target population (a specified subpopulation of all humans).  The results of a study are inferred from examination of the sample’s performance on a given measure, thus the sample is key in the line of reasoning from initial design to examination of results.  Several methods can be employed when choosing a sample: random, stratified and convenience.  '''Random sampling''' provides the best chance for the sample group to be representative of the target population.  '''Stratified samples''' reflect similar proportions of various sub-groups within a sample.  '''Convenience sampling''' involves choosing participants/subjects that are available at the time of data collection.  Convenience samples do not control for possible biases that may within certain subgroups of a population and thus the results and conclusions from a convenience sample must be analyzed with caution and triangulated. 

===Reliability===
A study is reliable if it is replicable and the same results are achieved repeatedly.   There are four types of reliability in regard to psychological study:
*Test-Retest Reliability (also called '''stability reliability''')
*Interrater Reliability
*Parallel Forms Reliability
*Internal Consistency Reliability

====Test-Retest Reliability====
To judge for reliability in this case, the test is administered two different times to the exact same or similar subjects.  This judges for consistency of results across time, and to make sure the results were not affected by context of the time.  Reliability is higher if the retest is close in chronological proximity to the original test.

Research psychologists tend to replicate older studies to generate theories or to amend findings to account for reliability.  In '''attention''' for example, Treisman consistently retested findings to amend the attention models.

====Interrater Reliability====
Two or more judges score the test.  The scores are then compared to determine how much the two raters agree on the consistency on a rating system.  

An example of interrater reliability would be that of teachers grading essays for an AP or IB exam.  If a scale from 1 to 5 was used (where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best), and one teacher gave an essay a score of 2 and another gave a score of 5, then the reliability would be inconsistent.  Through training, practice, and discussion, the individual raters can reach a consistent level of assessing an experiment, test, or result.  Often, the raters are moderated by a higher rater who will assist in reaching consistency.

====Parallel Forms Reliability====
A large set of questions that are related to the same construct are generated and then divided into two sets.  The two different sets are given to the same sample of people at the same time.  Therefore, the two tests that study the same content are judged against each other for consistency.

An example would be a pretest-posttest, where the two groups would either receive form 1 or form 2, and in the posttest situation, the groups would be switched.

====Internal Consistency Reliability====
In this case, the tool is used as the tool to determine reliability.  Thus would be a test situation in which the items on the test measure the same content.  Often, questions can be strikingly similar, which shows that the test is also a measure for internal consistency reliability.  Therefore, the similar questions should be answered in the same way.  There are different ways to measure internal consistency reliability:
*Average Inter-item Correlation
*Average Itemtotal Correlation
*Split-Half Reliability
*Cronbach's Alpha (a)

===Validity===  

===Triangulation===

===Quantitative versus Qualitative Measures===

===Concept Questions:===

1. In what ways has new technology changed the science of psychology? Provide three examples.

2. How does the importance of validity and reliability change depending on the type of study?

3. In what ways will the different aspects of an experiment (sampling, methods, reliabilty, and validity) affect the results and conclusions of an psychology study?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Models of Conditioning==
===Classical Conditioning===
Ivan Pavlov was studying physiology when he discovered his psychological theories.  Pavlov’s study related to creating a conditioned response of salivation in dogs with a '''neutral stimulus'''.  A neutral stimulus is a stimulus that would not normally cause a certain response.  Pavlov observed that as he presented dogs with food that they would begin to salivate.  The dogs even began to associate footsteps with food, because every time a person walked by the dog it would be fed.  Eventually, the neutral stimulus (footsteps) created a '''conditioned response''' (salivation), when prior to the study only and unconditioned stimulus (food) would create an unconditioned response (salivation). (Pavlov, 1927) Although Pavlov did use the neural stimulus of footsteps to garner a conditioned response, there were other stimuli used. Some of those stimuli were whistles, metronomes, and even tuning forks, which only triangulated the work of Pavlov making his study more valid and reliable. 
====Results of Pavlov's Work====
Pavlov’s results allowed for the creation of '''behaviorism''' and helped move psychology from a pseudo-science, as often seen in Freud’s research, to a hard science.  Pavlov applied the scientific method to psychology.  His was the first theory of classical conditioning.  Many researchers after Pavlov have triangulated his studies.  An interesting study conditioned wolves and coyotes to fear sheep because the predators had been fed mutton with a small amount of lithium chloride, making the animals violently ill.  (Gustafson et al., 1974) Moreover Pavlov's work has allowed for the creation and laid the groundwork for the philosophy of the mind. In this branch of philosophy the nature of the mind,mental process and etc. are looked at in terms of its relationship to the body. Thusly, it can be said that Pavlov was an essential in the formation of psychology and philosophy based on mental processes.

===Classical Condtioning and Emotions===
J. B. Watson used a slightly less ethical approach in his study, in which in conditioned fear responses in an infant named Albert.  Watson presented the orphaned Albert with various stimuli to see if he could elicit a fearful reaction.  Watson wanted to show that phobias are caused by external stimuli and not naturally ingrained.  He presented Albert with a white rat, a rabbit, a monkey, a dog, masks with and without hair, and white cotton wool.  None of the stimuli produced a fearful response and all stimuli were thus deemed neutral.  Next, Watson created a fear response in the child by creating a loud noise directly behind him, which caused the child to cry.  Watson began to present the white rat with the loud noise to see if the child would associate the two together.  After a week of presenting the two together, only the white rat was presented, and Albert began to cry at the sight of it and tried to crawl away.  Albert had associated the white rat with the loud noise and feared the rat, which had originally been neutral.  Watson then proceeded to see if Albert would generalize his fear of the rat.  Watson presented Albert with the white rabbit and a dog, both of which caused a fearful reaction, when before the testing Albert had no fear of the dog, rabbit, or rat.  Albert had generalized his fear of the rat to the dog and rabbit. (Watson, 1920)

====Results of Watson's Work====
Watson was aware of the ethical implications of his study and wanted to recondition Albert after the testing, but the child was adopted before Watson had a chance. However, at the time of this study ethical implications were not really taken into consideration. The finding of evidence and gaining more research, was more important than the effects the research had on the participant. As society has progressed, the ethical implications of a study are looked at more seriously than at the time of Watson's study. The implications of Watson’s study are similar to those of Pavlov’s.  Watson had proved that fears do stem from unconscious conflicts but external sources.  He also showed that '''behavior is a result of learning and conditioning'''. Due to that result of learning, it could be assumed that the fears exhibited by Little Albert could have diminished due to the lack of learning and reinforcment.  This psychological process is referred to as extinction. Though in this case it was never tested, for Watson never studied Albert after the experiment. Watson furthered behaviorism and continued the push for psychology to become a hard science.

===Operant Conditioning===
Quite possibly the most radical behaviorist is B. F. Skinner, who theorized that all behaviors are in some way the result of operant conditioning.  Skinner theorized that if a behavior is followed by '''reinforcement''' (a reward), the behavior will be repeated, but if it is followed by '''punishment''', the behavior will not be repeated.  Further, a '''learned behavior''' can become extinct if the reinforcement is ended.  Skinner did not believe that the highly evolved consciousness or intellectual capacities of humans allowed us to have different behavior.  To prove his idea, Skinner created a superstitious pigeon.  Skinner’s experiment was simple, place a pigeon in a conditioning chamber, which is simply a box that is empty save for a tray where food can be dispensed.  Skinner automatically rewarded the pigeons with a pellet of food every 15 seconds, while he observed the behavior of the pigeons during that interval.  Of his eight subjects, six of the pigeons exhibited new behaviors between the feeding intervals that had never been observed before, ranging from counterclockwise turning to head thrusting to hopping.  Skinner explains the results as follows “The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking.” (Skinner, 1948)
====Results of Skinner's Work====
Skinner was and still is very influential, but his view of radical behaviorism has fallen out of prominence because of the use of better medical equipment such as fMRIs.  Skinner’s legacy is seen today in operant conditioning.  Simple behaviors in children and animals can be created or eliminated through operant conditioning but new research shows that there are cognitive aspects to behavior and is not completely a product of the environment as Skinner believed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Types of Cognitive Functions==
===Latent Learning===

'''Edward Tolman''' published two studies in 1948 that drastically contradicted the overarching '''behavioralist''' views of the time.  Tolman studied cognitive maps and used rats to do so.  His first experiment studied '''latent learning'''; learning that is not readily apparent to the researcher, which heavily contradicts the move to make psychology a hard science by only studying the observable.  Tolman used three groups of rats and placed the rats in a maze.  The first group received no reward for finishing.  The second group always received a reward for finishing the maze.  The final group received no reward for the first 10 days of the study, but did receive one for the final eight.  Tolman observed that the first group made a consistently high number of errors in running the maze, and showed little improvement over the eighteen-day study.  The second group, which always received a reward, showed constant improvement in the number of errors made.  The final group showed little to no improvement for the first ten days, then dramatic improvement once a food reward was presented.  The final group’s improvement was more pronounced than the constant reward group. (Tolman, 1948)

:*Tolman theorized that the rats in the final group had been learning the maze over the first ten days of the study but had no incentive to run the maze without any errors.  
:*Once there was a reward the learning that had remained latent in the rats mind was useful and the rats ran the maze more efficiently.  
:*Tolman broke the constraints of behaviorism by studying a process that was not readily apparent to the researcher and not the direct consequence of stimulus response.  
:*Tolman’s work was very influential in the new cognitive approach that developed during the 1960s.

Tolman’s second study dealt with spatial orientation.  For this study, the rats ran a simple maze that started off on a round table.  The rats ran north into the maze, turned left and ran west, turned right and ran north, and finally turned right and ran east.  The maze ended with a food reward.  Further, there were never any dead ends or forks in the maze; it was very simple, and the maze ended with the rats at a position about 3 o’clock from the start of the maze, or about 45 degrees to the northeast.  After the rats had learned the simple maze, Tolman added twelve new lanes for the rats to enter from the starting table.  Tolman placed three on the left of the original lane, which had been blocked so the rats would enter and immediately exit once they realized it was not a dead end, and the other nine lanes to the right of the original lane.  The route most often taken was the lane that led most directly to where the original food reward was; in this case it was lane 6. (Tolman, 1948)

Tolman showed that the rats did need to follow a strip map as Tolman called it that led from A to B to C to D.  The rats had developed a lay of the land map that could give them the shortest distance from A to D.  Tolman states “The rats, it would seem, acquired not merely a strip-map to the effect that the original specifically trained-on path led to the food, but rather a wider, comprehensive map to the effect that food was located in such and such a direction in the room.”  Tolman had again shunned behaviorism, showing that there are cognitive functions that occur that can be studied, even if they cannot directly be observed.

===Insight Learning===
'''Wolfgang Kohler''' developed yet another theory of learning that differed from the trial and error ideas that were proposed before him.  Kohler called his discovery '''insight learning'''.  Kohler’s most famous study of insight learning was the study with '''Sultan the gorilla'''.  
:*Sultan was in a cage and was presented with a stick
:*He could use the stick to pull a piece of fruit close enough to the cage so that he could pick it up.  
:*After Sultan had learned to use the stick to reach the fruit, Kohler moved the fruit farther away from Sultan and out of the range of the short stick.  
:*Kohler then placed a longer stick within the reach of the short stick Sultan already had.  
:*Initially, Sultan tried to reach the fruit with the short stick and failed.   
:*After Sultan had looked around, he picked up the short stick again, used it to reach the long stick, and used the long stick to reach the fruit. (Kohler, 1925)

Kohler called this type of learning insight learning.  Sultan was never conditioned to use one stick to reach another; it would seem as if Sultan had an epiphany.  Kohler explained it simply as there are cognitive processes in learning and learning is not merely conditioning.  Kohler showed that there was no gradual shaping or trial and error, thus there must be internal organizational processes, which caused the new behavior.

# Imprinting and Learned helplessness (Lorenz and Seligman)

==Content==

== Martin Seligman ==
Through Martin Seligman's experiments and the evaluation and observation of human behavior over the past decades by other researchers in his field, psychologists have solidified the theory of passive resignation, better known as '''learned helplessness.''' The identification of '''Learned Helplessness''' has led to a greater understanding of the causes of depression, war weariness in civilian populations, lack of student motivation, and etc. 


== Learned Helplessness ==
Martin Seligman proposed that our perceptions of power and control are learned from experience. His theory proposed that when a person's efforts of trying to control certain life's events fails repeatedly, the person may stop attempting to take control altogether. So, if the failures repeated over time the person may begin to generalize the perception of a lack of control to all similar situations. The person will begin to feel helpless, depressed, and unmotivated. Psychologist Julian Rotter called it an '''external locus of control''', which she defines as of the perception that chance or outside forces determine their fate. On the opposite end of the spectrum are persons who perceive life as an '''internal locus of control''', who believe more in free will or that they have greater extent they control their own destiny. People on the more internal locus spectrum have shown to demonstrate better self-control, the ability to control impulses and the need for gratification, which predicts better grades and more social success. Those results were determined by a recent survey by June Tangney and her colleagues in 2003. 


== Research ==

Seligman’s research with his 24 &quot;mongrel&quot; dogs, being subjected to painful shocks, has raised many ethical questions but psychologist and society overall agree that his research has extended our knowledge, reduced human suffering, and improved the quality of life, justifying his methods. Seligman and his colleague Maier in 1967 carried out at an experiment to help demonstrate the learned helplessness paradigm. They divided dogs into three groups. The first two groups consisted of &quot;yoked pairs,&quot; that is, one dog of each pair received an electric shock that it could terminate, and the other dog in each pair received the same shock. To this second dog, the shock seemed to stop at random, because it was the first dog that was ending the shock. The dogs with no control over the shocks were said to receive &quot;inescapable shock.&quot; The third group of dogs was control subjects who received no shock in this phase of the experiment. 

So by carrying out this procedure Seligman and Maier claimed to have demonstrated that it was the perceived inescapability of the shocks, and not the shocks alone, which explained the passive behavior. This was not Seligman’s only experiment to help demonstrate the concept of Learned Helplessness; he tested over 150 dogs and also group of humans.  Not all of the dogs in Seligman's experiments, however, became helpless. Of the roughly 150 dogs in experiments in the latter half of the sixties, about one-third did not become helpless, but instead somehow managed to find a way out of the unpleasant situation in spite of their past experience with it. 

The corresponding characteristic in humans has been found to correlate highly with optimism; however, not a naive optimism, but an explanatory style that views the situation as other than personal, pervasive, or permanent. In the group where tested humans, he gave one group the choice of turning off a loud noise while performing a test which most cases they didn’t bother, while another group didn’t have the choice. The group that had the choices had better results on the test. So to come to a conclusion, simply being aware of the ability to do so (turn off the noise) was enough to substantially counteract its distracting effect. Overall when subjects feel they have some control over their environment, they will not developments signs of clinical depression, pessimism, and the overall effects of learned helplessness.

'''Closing Note'''
With all these examples we can identify learned helplessness by using Seligman’s explanatory style, the three P‘s. 
'''Personal''' - the person may see himself or herself as the problem; that is, they have internalized the problem. 
'''Pervasive''' is when they may see the problem affecting all aspects of life, 
And finally, '''permanent''' when the person may see the problem as unchangeable.

== Imprinting ==
Lorenz was the first scientist to observe '''imprinting''' with his experiments on ducklings in 1935. Prior, to the observations made by Lorenz, there was a common consensus that imprinting existed though it had never been seen. During his test, the ducklings formed an attachment to their mothers-or whatever other moving object that appears-within the first two days of life. This period in which the ducks attached with whatever stimulus would later be known as the critical period. It is within this 36 hours or critical period in which, the geese must decide to continue to learn from the stimulus they attach to. In Lorenz case it happened to be himself, and in particular his boots. This discovery of imprinting has prompted continued examination of the relative roles of instinct and acquired behavior in the process of learning.

== Social Learning Theory ==


'''Social Learning Theory''' is learning through the medium of a social context. It's overall premise is that people learn from one and other through such tools as observational learning, imitation, and modeling. There are 4 overall principles to social learning:

1. People learn by observation of others, being that a subject   observes anothers behavior and witnesses that behavior's outcome. 

2. Learning may or may not result in a behavarial change. Social theorists say people may learn through observation alone, but of their execution of the task may not demonstrate learned behavior. 

3. Cognition plays an important role, overall humans have shown that awareness and expectation of certain outcome severely influences behavior. 

4. The social learning theory can be seen as a link between behaviorist learning theories and cognitive learning theories.

== Albert Bandura and Modeling ==
 
Bandura's experiments dealing with the concept of modeling revolves aroud his work with Bobo dolls. He displayed a video to Pre-age children where an adult beat up on a doll, called it mean names, and displayed hostile behavior. For the next step, Bandura split the children into groups, and each group watched a video with a different outcome for the aggressive behavior. One video showed the adult being rewarded for his behavior, the second the subject being punished, and the third video showed no consequences. He then studied the differences between how male children and female children reacted to this video in regard to whether they imitated the observed behavior or not. 
In conclusion, males in all cases imitated the observed adults behavior more so than females. The results support that the children who watched the video in which the person was rewarded for his actions repeated the behaviors more so than when the person was punished or did not receive either a punishment or reward. Overall this experiment supports Bandura's theory that people learn by observing others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lesioning, EEGs, Neuro-imaging, experimental research, clinical research==

In early psychology, researchers labeled the brain as a “black box” unable to be fully understood on a physical level. However with inventions and innovative technological methods established within the last few decades, these tools have allowed for researchers to ‘view’ the brain or/ and gain a better understanding of its processes. 

===Lesioning===
One method used by researchers is brain lesioning where he or she will purposefully destroy brain tissue in order to discover what action or brain process is affected and therefore unaffected by the damaged tissue. This procedure is practiced on animals considering that destroying human brain tissue is highly unethical. Using brain lesioning, researches have also discovered where the many localized functions of the brain are; for example, the language areas (Broca’s and Wernicke’s) are in the left frontal and in the left temporal lobes while maintaining homeostasis in the body as well as other processes such as regulating emotions is located in the hypothalamus which is in the middle of the base of the brain. One of the first cases that allowed researches to understand how damaged tissues can affect ones brain occurred when a man Phinius Gage suffered from a serious brain injury while working on his job. A pole went through his brain and though he survived the accident, physically unharmed, he seemingly became a totally new person with an abrasive attitude and a rude and vulgar personality. His severe and shocking change in personality led researchers to the conclusion that damaged brain tissue in the frontal lobe area was to blame and that the frontal lobe is a key component to a person’s personality.

===Electroencephlagram===
An EEG or an electroencephalogram is an amplified tracing of such waves by an instrument called an electroencephalograph. Researchers use this instrument in order to localize functions of the brain as well. Researchers compare a subject’s EEG to a standard EEG of average data in order to discover any differences when the patient is performing a task. The EEG will show different pattern of lines when a certain brain process is occurring and the researchers can then use the graphs to correlate the data to an electrical wave evoked by the stimulus and thus, its relative position. More recent and advanced technology can even allow researchers to directly view the brain. CT (computed tomography) scans examine the brain by taking x-ray photographs that can reveal brain damage and even more accurate are PET (positron emission tomography) scans which show brain processes by using the sugar glucose in the brain to illustrate where neuron firing is taking place in the brain because active neurons use glucose as fuel. With PET scans, researchers can only locate areas of brain activity and not specific locations as they might with brain lesioning. The most advanced and helpful invention in brain physiology, however, is the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan and especially the FMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging). With a MRI, the patient’s head is put in a strong magnetic field, which aligns the spinning atoms then the atoms are disoriented from a radio wave and proceed to release detectable signs when they are realigned. In a FMRI a patient can perform mental tasks and the area of action can be detected through its blood flow from one part of the brain to another by taking pictures less than a second apart and showing where the brain “lights up”. For example, when a person processes visual information, blood rushes to the back of the brain. FMRIs make it possible to show when things happen, how brain areas change with experience, and what brain areas work together.

===Neuroimaging===


Neuro Imaging refers to numerous methods employed psychologists and researchers to create an image of the structure or functioning of the brain.  This is a fairly recent development in the field of medicine and psychological research.  These new technologies have had a drastic impact on past and current research in the human brain.  Researchers can now pair different brain functions with the area of the brain responsible for processing that function.  These technologies also aids in diagnosis of brain disorders as well as numerous other areas of brain research.  

'''CAT'''
'''Computed Tomography''' (CT) or '''Computed Axial Tomography''' (CAT) scanning uses x-ray technology to give doctors an image of the structure of the brain.  Because the image is available relative quickly, CAT scans are ideal for doctors evaluating brain injuries.  The image can show the more dense areas of the brain to help doctors pinpoint areas of swelling in the brain.  This form of neuroimaging does not show functioning of different areas of the brain, it is only capable of showing an image of the brain structure.  The Image created from CAT scans is somewhat less detailed than that of the MRI.

'''fMRI'''

'''PET'''

# Brain development through the lifespan
# Drugs and the brain
# Stress and the brain

The human brain develops and changes in response to a variety of factors. 
1. Genetic predispositions, for such diseases as alcoholism, make some brains more vulnerable to environmental factors.  
2. In the grand scheme of brain development, the brain mostly develops due to environmental factors.  
3. Within the fetus, genes and hormones control the formation of neural networks.  Once exposed to the outside world, baby's brains are extremely sensitive to stimuli.  What these humans learn throughout their development affects what gets pruned during apoptosis, which occurs in early childhood as well as in adolescence. 
4. Cultural factors also have implications for development. 
5. Exposure to drugs and stress physically changes neural structures, mostly in a negative way. 
Ultimately, physical changes in the brain and how the brain functions determine one's behavior.

== '''The Developing Brain''' ==
	
 
From conception the premature baby brain relies on '''cell migration'''.  The trillions of brain cells line up in the brain based on how the other neurons around it are moving.  

''No two brains are alike.''  Even identical twins have differently structured brains by the time they are born (Patrick, 1997).  While in the womb, exposure to sex hormones, such as '''androgens''', shape the brain’s development and future sex behavior. ''' Robert W. Goy of the University of Wisconsin''' studies the differences in male and female brain structure. 
     Description of Theory an Hypothesis
According to him, androgens help to create male brains and female brains develop in a lack of androgens.  This exposure to sex hormones during early life produces lifelong changes between the sexes.  The hypothalamus, which controls male and female reproductive behavior, is larger in males and smaller in females.  In addition, '''men tend to be better at spatial tasks, mathematical reasonging, and target-directed motore skills.  Women have better verbal abilities, workd recall, and precision manual skills.'''  Women have larger corpus callosums, aiding in communication between right and left hemispheres for better speech abilities whereas men rely on the posterior portion of their left hemispheres for speech.  For this reason, men are more likely to incur aphasia after a stroke, because it damages this region of the left hemisphere (Kimura, 1999).  

Future Research on Womb Exposure    
Girls exposed to large quantities of adrenal androgens before birth develop the genetic defect called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).  Sheri A. Berenbaum, who has studied CAH girls, notices more aggressive, male-like behavior in play- they prefer masculine toys and game over typical female ones (Kimura).  Some researchers suggest that tastes can be primed by exposure to the residue of food in their mother’s blood.  Babies born to drug addicts are addicted to drugs at birth and babies born to mothers eating curries and spicy foods have tastes for spicy foods themselves (Carter, 1998).  

The fetal brain is sparse, with many non-myelinated neurons, and missing connections between the auditory and visual cortices, and between the retina and thalamus (Carter, 1998). The baby’s brains must finish developing in the external environment.  
Since the hippocampus is not fully developed until the age of three, a baby toddler cannot store long-term memories, only emotional memories in the amygdala.  Heidelise Als, of Harvard Medical School, researches premature babies’ vulnerability to overstimulation.  Bright lights and loud sounds, common in the ICU, impede the premies’ brain development.  Als claims that for this reason, premies aften have difficulty in later life with learning, paying attention, and prioritizing.  When premies were placed in an environment that imitated the womb- dark, quiet, with physical contact, the premies’ brains developed normally.  When children lack physical contact or nurturing, psycho-social dwarfism may impede their growth.  The hypothalamus does not stimulate the thyroid to produce enough growth hormone.  In studies on Romanian orphanage children, the orphans had stunted growth, lower IQs, and more learning disabilities than average children (Groza et al., 1998).  A few years after the orphans were adopted, they caught up in height and improved their learning abilities.  
     '''Early Childhood Brain Development'''
'''Neuroplasticity''' is the brain’s ability to create new neural pathways based on new experiences.  It takes place over a lifetime, sometimes over genetically-determined critical periods.  At birth, there are approximately 2,500 synapses in the cerebral cortex of a human baby.By three years old, the cerebral cortex has about 15,000 synapses (Gopnick et al., 1999).  Because the infant brain has such a huge capacity for growth, it must eventually be pruned down.  Synaptic pruning, or apoptosis, is the programmed neuron cell death that takes place during early childhood and adolescence.  Pruning actually strengthens important connections and eliminates weaker ones, creating more effective neural communication (Brain Plasticity,2006).  Many times children lose their eidetic or photographic memory during apaptosis.  An incomplete pruning results in so-called idiot savantes while overkill apoptosis my strip too many connections and lead to Down’s syndrome (Carter, 1998).  

Plasticity can also be demonstrated in any learning.  For one to remember an experience, the circuitry of the brain must change.  According the Durbach (2000) learning takes place when there is either a “change in the internal structure of neurons” or an “increase in the number of synapses between neurons.”  Another name for this is Hebbian learning, where “the cells that fire together, wire together.”  With repeated exposure, certain pathways in the brain permanent (Hebb, 1949).

Rosenweig's study More Experience = Bigger Brains, illustrates in rats how the brain changes in response to experience.  Rats who lived in more enriched environments had larger neurons, more DNA and RNA, a heavier cerebral cortex, and larger synapses than rats who lived in sparse environments (Rosenweig et al., 1972).


== '''Drugs and the Brain''' ==

''Drugs directly affect the physiology of the brain’s composition and functioning and therefore human behavior. '' 

   Types of Drugs and Effects on the Brain and Behavior
The '''chemical THC''' in marijuana stimulates cannabinoid receptors in the brain, which affects the release of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine.  The effects of these two hormones eases pain and creates a euphoric-like sensation.  However, marijuana impairs memory in the hippocampus.  It lowers the functioning of the cerebral cortex, lowering concentration and judgement.  The THC slows down the cerebellum, impairing movement and affects perception in the sensory cortex, enhancing sensations and creating hallucinations.  

The '''depressant, alchohol''', in low doses, relaxes people, lowers inhibitions, and slows down reflexes.  In medium doses, alchohol also stimulates the release of norepinephrine and dopamine and causes a quick reuptake of acetylcholine and GABA.  The effect is relaxation, but loss of coordination, impaired memory, and impaired reason.  Even in monderate consumption, alchohol may cause brain shrinkage, according to a study on rats.  When chronically abused, alcohol damages the frontal lobes, decreases brain mass, decreases the size of ventricles which pump blood to the brain.  This may lead to permanent impairment of memory and speech, causing such disorders as Wernicke’s Encephalopathy and Korsikoff’s Syndrom.

Drinking during pregnancy can alter the genes of the fetus.  Babies with '''Fetal Alcohol Syndrome''' have smaller brains, lower IQs, and mental retardation.  The neurogenesis of the hippocampus is affected, and there are less overall neurons, leading to impaired learning and memory, as well as depression.  Also, the development of the corpus callosum is disrupted.  

'''Stimulants''' such as cocaine and crack prevent the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, creating a euphoric rush.   But after a while this depletes the brain’s supply of these neurotransmitters, creating a “crash” effect.  

Dr. Hans Brider took FMRI scans of cocaine users, revealing changes in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and anterior singulate.  These parts of the brain create the deep desire to do cocaine- especially the amygdala, which creates deep emotional memories concerning drug use.  Dr. Anna Rose Childress of the University of Pennsylvania also studied cocaine users, trying to trigger memories of drug use to see what parts of the brain it affected.  When participant were shown pictures of drug use or drug dealers, PET scan images also showed activity in the amygdala and nucleaus accumbens, which reveals where relapse cravings originate.  

Nicotine, another excitatory drug, is a competitive inhibitor for acetylcholine receptors in the brain.  Therefore, nicotine acts like acetylcholine and affect many functions, such as muscle movement, breathing, heart rate, learning, and memory.  Continually, acetylcholine stimulates the release of other neurotransmitters and hormones that play a role in mood, appetite, and memory.  Nicotine also raises levels of '''dopamine''' in the brain, which creates a feeling of euphoria.  Dopamine is present in cocaine and heroin and scientists suggest that the changes in dopamine play a role in why addiction occurs.

Amphetamines like '''ecstasy''' (MDMA) increase neurotransmitter activity in the brain.  Ecstasy stimulates the release of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.  Serotonin, the neurotransmitter greatly impacted by ecstasy, &quot;plays an important role in the regulation of mood, sleep, pain, appetite, and other behaviors&quot; (NIDA).   Repeated use of ecstasy or abuse of the drug can lead to a depletion of serotonin, an important neurotransmitter, and brain imaging of heavy users show that there are changes in regions involved in cognition, emotion, and motor function (McCann 2000, and Morgan 1999, 2000).  

'''Research on Addiction'''

Steven Hyman of the National Institute of Health proposes that some people may have higher endogenous stress levels or may lack dopamine receptors, making drug addiction and abuse more likely.  Genetics and family environments can also increase vulnerability to addiction.  According to Dr. Mark Shuckett, those people with an alcoholic parent are 60% more likely to become alcoholics themselves.

Certain cultural norms and environments foster alcohol and drug use.  Around 50% of college students consider themselves binge drinkers, with even higher percentages for those in fraternities, sororities, or military academies.  While binge drinking is more prevalent in the United States, cigarettes and other drugs are more common.  An estimated 20% of Europeans use marijuana.  Stress and traumatic events make drug and alcohol use more likely.  For example, there were widespread reports of increased alcholism after Hurricane Katrina and 9/11.

== '''Stress and the Brain'''	 ==


'''Stress''' has many definitions, but according to Richard Lazarus, stress is a state of anxiety produced when events and responsibities exceed one’s coping abilities.  In this way, stress relies not only on environmental factors, but on cognitive appraisals of these factors (Myers, 2004).  The cerebral cortex percieves the stressor, the hypothalamus stimulates the pituitary gland to release epinephrine and norepinephrine.  This in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to release the hormone cortisol (Myers, 2004).  Stress effects many other areas of the body, such as the amygdala, which produces a fear response.  It seems to hardwire the brain differently.  Middle-aged rats that had undergone early life stress had abnormal brain-cell activity and memory loss (Brunson et. al., 2005).  

The sources of stress are numerous: from catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina, significant life changes, poverty and inequality, to daily hassles like traffic tie-ups and demanding jobs (Myer, 2004).  Especially in urban and overcrowded environments, psychologists see links between everday stressors and hypertension,  and unhealthy behaviors such as lack of sleep and alcoholism (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984).  In fact, the leading causes of death today in America are linked to lifestyle and stress.  According UNSEC, about half of the world’s children grow up in extremely stressful environments (poverty, violence, war, abuse), which means that these children may have impaired cognitive abilities later on in life.  

Certain personalities are more susceptible to stress.  Friedman and Rosenman found that '''Type A people''', who are characterized as competitive, impatient, and aggressive, are more physically reactive to stress- they produce more hormones and have a higher blood pressure. '''Type B people''', who are more relaxed and easygoiong, are less prone to stress.  Most significantly, Type A's were 69% more likely to suffer from a  heart attack (Myers, 2004).  Type A's typically feel like they are less in control of situations.  

Accordint to research by Janet Rodin, the less percieved control of a situation, the greater the stress.  The elderly that lived in nursing homes, were lonely, and had to be fed, dressed, and changed, felt significantly more stress and had shorter lifespans than their independent, active counterparts.  

The Canadian scientist Hans Seyle was among the first to discover the link between stress and physical effects.  In studying stressed rats, Seyle observed the same reaction: shrinkage of the thymus gland, bleeding ulcers, and an enlargement of the adrenal glands. His continued research led him to naming the body’s response to stress '''General Adaptation Syndrome'''.  During phase one, one experiences an alarm reaction, the initial activation of the sympathetic nervous system.  In phase two, resistance, the body tries to cope with stress and there is an outpouring of stress hormones.  In the third and final stage, exhaustion, stress depletes the body’s reserves and wears down the immune system.  Additional research has shown that prolonged stress shrinks the hippocampus, which helps make memories explicit.   
   
Females seem to be more susceptible to stress and depression.  After experiencing traumatic events, females are twice as likely as men to develop '''Post Traumatic Stress Disorder''', where humans develop maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance, reduced responsiveness and guilt (Myers, 2004).   Researcher Tracey Shors concluded that in response to stress, females memory formation is more inhibited than that of male rats because of the fluctation of estrogen during and following the traumatic event.  In typical experiments, the rats were exposed to inescapable stressors such as tailshocks or swimming.  Later on, Shors would try to condition eyeblinks.  The stressors, in contrast to the females, actually improved the male rat’s learning and eyeblink responses.  Glucocorticoids, stress neurotransmitters in the brain, seemed to increase dendritic spine density in the hippocampus of male rats, but decreased the dendritic spine density in female rats (Shors, 2001).  
  
However, mindful exercise, such as Tai Chi, meditation, and aerobic exercise decrease stress response and promote overall well-being (Sandlund and Norlander, 2000).  In a University of Wisconsin study, participants who did meditative exercises showed more electrical activity in the left side of the frontal lobe, indicating that they had a lower anxiety and a more positive emotional state (Davidson, 2003).  Meditation, yoga, and other relaxation exercises also assist in autonomic reflexes.  This is called '''conscious control'''.  Through these practices, it is possible to gain control over the sphincter muscles in the anus and bladder.  Yoga has been shown to help control heart rate, blood pressure, and other autonomic functions.  These are learned behaviors - they involve the formation of new pathways in the brain.  

Researchers have also found the correlation between a social support network of close friends and family and less physiogical stress effects (Brown and Harris, 1978).  Stress Inoculation Training and Hardiness Training are cognitice behavioral techniques that work to improve stress resistance through analysing stressors, teaching coping techniques, and changing behavior so that the patient feels more assertive and in control (Meichenbaum, 1977) (Kobasa, 1986).  Drugs, such as beta-blockers, which reduce stress arousal, anxiolytic drgus, such as minor tranquilisors, and anti-depressant drugs, which treat severe anxiety, can also be used to combat stress.

==Content==

===Overview===

One of the most complex systems known to us today, the brain is made of systems and parts that all work together to keep the human body functioning.  The nervous system, the core of all processes, has two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).  The CNS is made of the brain and the spinal cord.  The PNS is the brain's connection to nerves.  It links the CNS to sense receptors, muscles, and glands.  Without the CNS and the PNS, we would not be able to function.  So, when explaining how the brain works physically, it is essential that we understand the core of all function.
	
===Peripheral Nervous System===

The PNS is the link from the brain to the rest of the body.  Because the PNS is so extensive, it is necessary that it be made of other systems that all work together to maintain the PNS.  The somatic nervous system, to start with, controls the movement of skeletal muscles.  The autonomic nervous system controls the glands and the muscles of internal organs.  This system controls basically all movement that we don't actually think about, such as a heartbeat, digestion, and glandular activity.  This system is also made of two parts: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.  The sympathetic nervous system arouses our bodies for defensive action.  It does this by accelerating your heartbeat, slowing your digestion, raising your blood sugar, dilating your arteries, and cooling you with perspiration.  As soon as your body realizes that it no longer needs to be ready for defensive action, your parasympathetic nervous system takes over.  This system calms your body by undoing everything that the sympathetic nervous system just did, such as decreasing your heartbeat.

===Central Nervous System===
	
The CNS is made of the spinal cord and brain.  It links the PNS to the brain, thereby allowing the brain to be aware of the physical actions taking place.  The spinal cord itself controls muscular reflexes.  When you touch something hot, for example, you pull your hand away and then feel pain.  Your spinal cord sends out a message to your muscles to pull your hand away, long before the pain sensation has reached your brain.  The CNS also is made of the neural networks in the brain which interpret information, allowing the brain to take the necessary actions.  These neural networks are cluster of neurons, which can communicate with each other through chemical changes in the brain.

===Neurons===
	
Neurons are nerve cells.  Although there are many different types of neurons, they all have the same essential parts.  All neurons have dendrites that receive information, an axon that passes the message from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands.  The myelin sheath insulates the axon and helps to speed impulses.  A neural impulse is an electrical signal that travels down the axon.   Impulses are made from an exchange of ions between neurons.  At the resting potential, the neuron has a negative charge in its axon and is surrounded by a positive charge.  When the action potential is reached, the axon is depolarized, positive charges travel down the axon, and then trigger the release of neurotransmitters.  After the impulse is sent, the neuron goes through a refractory period where the positive charges are pushed back outside the axon.  The neurotransmitters that are sent are received on the dendrites of the receiving neuron.  These neurotransmitters can either be excitatory or inhibitory.  When there are more excitatory neurotransmitters and too few inhibitory neurotransmitters, the neuron's threshold is reached and the action potential is triggered.  Neurons have an all-or-none response.  The strength of the stimulus does not affect the action potential’s speed.  In other words, it doesn't matter by how much the excitatory neurotransmitters outnumber the inhibitory neurotransmitters.  As long as the number reaches the neuron's threshold, the action potential is triggered.

===Synaptic Gaps and Neurotransmitters===

In between neurons is the synaptic gap.  This gap separates the axon terminal from the receiving neuron.  It is across this gap that neurotransmitters must be sent.  Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that are sent by neurons.  They cross the synaptic gap to bind to receptor sites.  Once they are bound to the receptor sites, neurotransmitters unlock channels in the receptor neuron.  This allows ions to flood the axon of the neuron and the process is repeated.  When a neuron releases too many neurons, it re-absorbs the excess neurotransmitters.  This process is known as reuptake.  Neurotransmitters can produce many different reactions in the brain and throughout the body.  Acetylcholine, for example, enables muscle function, learning, and memory.  Another neurotransmitter, dopamine, allows for movement, learning, attention, and emotion.  Serotonin helps control mood, hunger, sleep, and arousal.  Norepinephrine controls alertness and arousal.  These neurotransmitters can be mimicked by certain drugs and chemicals.  When the drugs are used for a long time, however, the brain becomes dependent on them and stops producing certain neurotransmitters naturally.

===Parts of the Brain===
	
Neurons send this information throughout the brain, including the brainstem, the thalamus, the cerebellum, the limbic system, and the cerebral cortex.  The brainstem, the oldest and innermost region of the brain, contains the medulla and the reticular formation.  The medulla controls heartbeat and breathing.  The reticular formation helps control arousal and sends incoming information from the thalamus to specific parts of the brain.  The thalamus is the “sensory switchboard.”  It receives information from all of the senses except smell and routes the information to other areas of the brain.  When it receives replies, the thalamus sends them to the cerebellum and the medulla.  The cerebellum, which means little brain, coordinates voluntary movement of the body.  The limbic system, near the cerebellum, influences emotions and motives, partly through hormones.  The limbic system contains the amygdale which influences aggression and fear.  It also includes the hypothalamus, which regulates thirst, hunger, and body temperature.  The hypothalamus secretes hormones that affect both bodily functions and other hormonal glands.  Lastly, the limbic system contains the hippocampus which lays down long-term memories.  The cerebral cortex is the ultimate control and information-processing center in the brain.  It contains the parietal lobes, the occipital lobes, the temporal lobes, and the frontal lobes.  The cerebral cortex also contains glial cells, which guide neural connections, provide nutrients and myelin to neurons, and absorb extra ions and neurotransmitters.  The frontal lobes in the cerebral cortex control speaking, muscle movements, and the ability to make plans and judgments.  The parietal lobes include the sensory cortex which controls the information that the brain receives from our senses.  The temporal lobes contain the auditory areas in the brain.  The motor cortex, found in the frontal lobes, is in control of bodily movements.

===Specialization and Integration===
	
All of the parts of the brain have their own specialities but need to work as a complete system to make sure that the body functions correctly.  This is known as specialization and integration.  An example of specialization and integration would be how we read aloud.  Our visual cortex receives written words as stimulation.  The angular gyrus then transforms the visual representations to an auditory code.  This code is then sent to Wernicke’s area, which interprets the code and sends it to Broca’s area, which controls speech muscles via the motor cortex.  The motor cortex then controls the muscles in the mouth to pronounce the word.  All of these systems work together to produce something as simple as reading aloud; there is no one system that can produce the same effect...

===Endocrine System===
	
The endocrine system controls the secretion of hormones throughout the body.  These hormones influence our interest in sex, food, and aggression.  The glands that secrete hormones are: the hypothalamus, which controls the pituitary gland; the pituitary gland secretes many different hormones, some of which are used to control other glands; the thyroid sends out hormones that are used to control metabolism; the hormones from the parathyroid control the amount of calcium found in the blood stream; the adrenal glands trigger the fight or flight response; and the pancreas controls the level of sugar in the blood.

===Circadian Rhythms===
	
The body is also on a schedule of bodily rhythms.  There are annual cycles, that affect seasonal affective disorder.  There are 
also 24-hour cycles, which control when we want to sleep.  This cycle is known as a circadian rhythm.  During a 24-hour period, our body temperature goes up in the morning, peaks during the day, and begins to fall in early afternoon when many people take siestas.  When we sleep, our bodies also go through a certain rhythm.  Sleep is separated into five stages.  The first stage is when you have just fallen asleep.  During this stage that lasts up to five minutes, breathing is slowed and there are irregular brain wave patterns.  During stage 2, which lasts for about twenty minutes, there are periods of active brain activity.  This is the stage when sleep talking would occur.  During stages 3 to 4, the brain emits delta waves for about thirty minutes.  After stage 4, we seem to begin to cycle out of sleep, but instead of reaching stage one again we go into REM sleep, or rapid eye movement.  This is when your heart rate is increased, we have irregular breathing patterns, and eye movement can be seen.

	
All of the parts of the brains and different systems allow our bodies to work efficiently and correctly.  Without even one of these systems, our bodies would not work the same.  Although each part of the brain and each system has a special job, they all work together to maintain our bodily functions and higher thought.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definitions of Attention==
#Means by which we actively process a limited amount of information from the myriad of information available through our senses, stored memories, and other cognitive processes.
#Refers to the allocation of processing resources assuming limited resources
#The ability to focus on a given task-&gt;Focusing on certain features of the environment to the exclusion of other features
#The ability to concentrate-&gt;Allows either selective awareness or responsiveness

==Controlled vs. Automated Processes&lt;br&gt;==
Controlled processes are those which a person actively partakes in, the processes that require a person to focus or concentrate are considered controlled processes.  In terms of attention as the allocation of processing resources assuming limited resources, controlled processes consume a very large amount of resources.  Automated processes are those which require very little focus, concentration, or attentional resources, depending on the definition used.  These processes can interfere, support, or have no effect on one another.  When learning a new process, an old automated process can prevent learning-learning to swing a tennis racket after learning to swing a baseball bat- advance learning- throwing almost any object- or do nothing- knowing proper running form will not affect the previous two tasks.

====Controlled Processes&lt;br&gt;====
All processes begin as controlled processes.  Most tasks that are performed are a series of mental processes.  When a process is considered a controlled process, it is performed serially, every step of the process must be performed one at a time until the controlled process finally becomes an automated process through automatization.  Controlled processes are basically newly learned processes.

====Automatization&lt;br&gt;====
This is the name for the process through which a process changes from a controlled to an automated process.  As a controlled process is repeated several times, the neurons which fire in the process eventually move into position so that the current that flows through them meets very little resitance, thus streamlining the process.  As the neurons rearrange themselves, the process becomes automated.

====Automated Processes&lt;br&gt;====
These are the processes which can be performed in parallel, multiple different processes at one time.  These processes require very little attention and occur automatically, sometimes without the knowledge of the person performing the task.

==Selective Vs. Divided Attention==
====Selective Attention&lt;br&gt;====
Selective attention is when a person attends to one task over others.

====Divided Attention&lt;br&gt;====
Divided attenion is when a person attends to multiple tasks simultaneously.  This kind of attention has been shown to be affected by three factors: task difficulty (performance and task difficulty have an inverse relationship), task similarity (performance and task similarity also have an inverse relationship), and practice ( the more practice, the better the performance).

====Dichotic Listening Task====
*Auditory Theory of Attention(Cherry 1953; Moray 1959)
**Subjects were instructed to listen to 2 different conversations and 'shadow' one of them.  This forced the subjects to focus on only one of the conversations.  In the end, the subjects were able to recall information about the conversation that was listened to with no out of the ordinary results, but the participants could only tell physical charateristics of the speaker of the unattended message.  The subjects could only state the gender, whether the sound was human or a noise, and the distance of the speaker.  Information about the actual message could not be recalled including the language spoken and the actual words spoken, even if the message was nothing more than the repition of one word.  The experiments did show that people will change the focus of their attention when a certain stimulus is used.  The effect has come to be called the cocktail party phenomenon because of how when in a conversation, with noise in the background, a person will respond to the call of their name that has was said in a tone that no one else heard.


====Broadbent's Filter Theory&lt;br&gt;====
This filter theory is based on Cherry's studies and states that as information is processed, there is a filter which blocks the processing of most stimuli in an effort to keep the the processing mechanism of the brain from overloading.  According to Broadbent, this filter blocks all but the physical characteristics of a stimulus from being processed if another stimulus is being processed at that time.  This theory, however, does not account for a person's ability to increase their ability to attend to multiple stimuli.

=====Evidence against Broadbent’s Filter Theory=====

Moray (1959) showed that about one third of the time a subject could detect their own name in the non-shadowed message.  This anomaly shows that there is some semantic filter that Broadbent never accounted for.

Underwood (1974) showed that subjects who had previously participated in shadowing tasks could eventually be trained in dichotic listening tasks and recall about 67% of digits from the non-shadowed message, whereas non-experienced subjects could only recall about 8%.

====Triesman's Attenuation Theory&lt;br&gt;====
Triesman basically revised Broadbent's theory.  Triesman's attenuation theory states that people process stimuli in an hierarchy from attended to unattended stimuli and attentional resources are allocated accordin to this hierarchy.  As the processing becomes deeper, the information processed bottlenecks.

=====Evidence for Treisman’s Attenuation Theory=====

Gray and Wedderburn (1960) played the messages “What 6 hell” and “2 the 9” and the subjects reported hearing “What the hell” and “2 6 9”.  Their study shows that there is a semantic filter that Broadbent’s theory does not account for in his theory.  Also, shows that it is easier for subjects to switch between messages than Broadbent concluded.

====Visual Search&lt;br&gt;====
Visual Search is the finding of a target amidst the environment.  Visual search is affected by the similarity of distracters and the target and the set size being searched.

=====Theories of Visual Search=====

Feature Detection

Ulric Neisser believed that subjects automatically process the basic features of a scene in parallel.  He showed that subjects more easily located a target object when it was around dissimilar objects rather than similar.  For example, it is easier to find the letter “X” when it is surrounded by the letter “O” than when it is surrounded by the letter “K”.

==Other Theories of Attention==
====Feature Integration Theory&lt;br&gt;====
Triesman developed the theory of Feature Integration which states that all stimuli are first processed in parallel and then serially in a conjuntion search in which certain features are looked for in combination.  This theory has led to other theories such as guided search theory, but ignores the effects of the similarities between distracters and the target.  The theory also incorrectly assumes that processing occurs in two phases: parallel, then serially.

====Guided Search Theory&lt;br&gt;====
Developed by Wolfe in 1998, Guided Search theory is a revised version of Feature Integration theory.  Guided Search theory states that serial and parallel processing occurs simultaneously in differing amounts.  At first an 'activation map' is created and objects that are similar to the target are identified.  Next, the similar objects are processed serially while all other objects are processed in parallel to dientify the target.

====Central Capacity Theories&lt;br&gt;====
Central capacity theories state that the ability for someone to attend to a stimulus is based on the amount of attentional resources that the person has.  Problems with this theory mainly involve how the resources are distributed: theoretically, if one pair of tasks is similar but different and another pair is completely different, performance should be the same for both sets of tasks which is not how the experiments turn out.

====Filter Theory&lt;br&gt;====
Filter theories assume that attending to multiple tasks simultaneously results in only retaining information about certain characteristics in the varying tasks.  Filter theorists believe that there is just a wall which blocks the further processing of information of all but one or two attended to tasks.  This type of theory does not account for the ability of someone to improve their ability to attend to multiple tasks.

====Bottleneck Theory&lt;br&gt;====
Bottleneck theories state that information is processed simultaneously but the processing of information decreases in performance as the number and difficulty of the tasks increases.

==Content==
We live in a society that thrives on communication- books, newspapers, television, music, cell phones, and the internet are all mediums through which we use language to report information and express ideas. What is truly amazing is that each one of us begins life without knowing a single word, and yet within a lifetime learns approximately 80,000 words (Miller &amp; Gildea, 1987) and the grammatical structure that allows these words to be put together in meaningful combinations. Furthermore, we are the only species in the animal kingdom that has demonstrated a sophisticated use of language, which consists of “our spoken, written, or signed words and the way we combine them to communicate meaning” (Myers, 2004)

'''Phonemes''' are the smallest sound units.
'''Morphemes''' are the smallest units of meaning (usually words, but also prefixes).

Bat, Bait, Beat, Beet, Bet, Bit, Bite, Boat, Boot, Bought, Bout, But are all only one phoneme different, and thus are different morphemes. The word undescribable has four morphemes un, de, scrib, and able (Myers, 2004). 

==Biological Elements of Language==

An early, prominent language development theory had been proposed by psychologist '''B. F. Skinner'''. A behavioralist, he felt that language is learned through association (“milk” with a bottle), imitation, and reinforcement (through praise offered by parents). Children with little language reinforcement, he argued, are less conditioned to speak, and therefore do it more slowly and less fluently.

'''Noam Chomsky''', a linguist at MIT, proposed a different theory. He believed that children acquired language too rapidly to have been the result of conditioning, and that their ability to create novel sentences proved that they weren’t just imitating others. Chomsky decided that there must be an underlying biological component that facilitates in language development. 

This theorized biological component was originally called the '''Language Acquisition Device''' (LAD), but is now more commonly referred to as '''universal grammar'''. We each learn the language most prevalent in our environment, but we have a natural ability to learn grammar. Our innate capability is illustrated by commonalities in languages worldwide: though ordering subject, verb, and object can create six distinct orders, 44% of languages have subject-object-verb order, and another 35% have subject-verb-object order (book handout). The fact that we often cannot explicitly state grammar rules that we use all the time further demonstrates this. For example, what order should these words be in: tin rusty can, or rusty tin can? 

Brain damage provides psychologists with insights into how the brain processes language. '''Aphasia''' is the general term for language impairment, and usually comes in two forms: Broca’s aphasia and Wernicke’s aphasia. 

They have found that injury to a part of the left frontal lobe causes suffers to struggle to form sentences, though they are still left the ability to comprehend speech and recite their favorite song lyrics. This region of the brain, known as '''Broca’s area''', helps mold ideas into grammatically-structured sentences and facilitates the muscle movement required for speaking. Consequently, their speech generally consists of telegraphic phrases. 

Injuries to the left temporal lobe, in a region of the brain known as '''Wernicke’s area''', also cause language impairment. However, though a sufferer of Wernicke’s aphasia maintains grammatical structure in their sentences (without paying attention to the actual words, an observer might think a patient was a normal speaker), the thoughts they convey seem vague, confusing, and lack meaning. They may use words in the wrong context, or even use nonexistent words. Thus, a person with Wernicke’s aphasia has an impaired ability to comprehend spoken language. Words’ greater implications are lost to them.

A study of from-birth deaf children who learn sign language after age 9 found that these children are less fluent in ASL than deaf children who had previously learned spoken English before losing their hearing at age 9 or later (Mayberry &amp; others, 2002). This finding demonstrates the benefits of early language learning. The from-birth deaf children had not had sufficient language exposure at a time when their brains could most easily respond to language stimulation.  Without this stimulation, Wernicke's and Broca's areas did not completely form.  The system of communication in our brain that we use to comprehend speech and to produce our own wasn't present in these children.  This can be related to the idea that &quot;neurons that fire together, wire together.&quot;  The average human brain has a system that allows us to listen to speech, comprehend its meaning, and react to it.  The brains of children who are deaf from birth are not allowed to make these connections and are therefore not able to learn speech in the same way that average children are.  Other parts of their brains, however, allow them to comprehend and react to ASL, much as they would to regular language.  This exemplifies the plasticity of a child's brain.

One way psychologists study language is through triangulation of results using primates. When looking at language in other animals, criteria must be developed. According to Hockett (1960), in order to be considered language, communication must possess semanticity (morphemes must contain meaning), arbitrariness (the letters ‘cat’ refer to a feline), displacement (in the absence of the object, ideas can still be expressed), prevarication (humor), and productivity (wide ranges of ideas can be expressed). Language also needs to be completely unique to every person; in order for any sort of communication to be considered as language, the animal speaking it has to be able to come up with unique word combinations on its own.  Without the idea of unique language, some communication that is inherent in certain species could be called language.  Admittedly, these criteria are possibly too stringent.

'''Washoe''', 1-year-old female common champanzee- in four years of training, learned 132 ASL signs, and was at the telegraphic speech stage (Gardner, 1969). Though her trainers believed she showed some comprehension of grammar, deaf signers noticed fewer signs (Pinker,1994) and other researchers doubt the grammatical conclusions of the Gardners.

'''Kanzi''', male bonabo chimpanzee- learned to understand 60 lexigrams and use 50. By four years he had created 500 combinations of words. A study found that Kanzi was correct 82% of the time when told a command in the form “Go ___ to get ___” while a 2-year-old girl was only correct 45% of the time (Savage-Rumbaugh &amp; others, 1993). Of course, he had been well-trained in retrieving objects.

'''Panbinisha''', bonobo chimpanzee-  raised emersed in language, learned 3000 words in 14 years. She also could form grammatically correct sentences and exhibited the criterion of prevarication. She understood that a person was looking for a sweet, and not the insect that it had been replaced with (Leake, 1999).


==Important Theories and Theorists==

'''Jean Piaget (1896-1980)''' 

Piaget hypothesized that humans desire a state of cognitive balance and in order to adapt an individual will use assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation is the process of changing one's environment to place into the preexisting schema. Accommodation is the process of changing the cognitive structure to adapt to the new environment. Children have to develop first mentally in order to develop language.
Piaget believed that children create their world through interactions that build the schemas, mental structures of the mind. This coincides with the constructivist view which is a &quot;viewpoint in [the] learning theory which holds that individuals acquire knowledge by building it from innate capabilities interacting with the environment&quot;. Constructivist theory suggests that as students learn, they don’t memorize or take on others' conceptions of reality; instead, they create their own meaning and understanding of reality. 
He also held many other key ideas which helped shape his beliefs on how young children learn and develop language. 
For instance:

''Classification''- the ability to group objects together on the basis of common features.
 
''Class inclusion''- understanding and more advanced than classification; also understanding that some classes or sets of objects are also sub-sets of a larger class.
 
''Conservation''- The realization that objects or sets of objects stay the same even when they are changed or made to look different.
 
''Egocentrism''- The belief that you are the center of the universe and everything revolves around you which disable you to see the world as someone else does and adapt to it. According to Piaget however, this is not mere moral &quot;selfishness&quot; it is rather an early stage of psychological development.

''Operation''- The process of working something out in your head; young children have to act things out instead of working problems out in their heads like older children and adults can often do.
 
He also developed a '''four stage model of cognitive development.'''

1.	'''Sensorimotor stage''' (Infancy-0 to 2 years). Knowledge of the world is limited because it is only based on immediate physical interactions / experiences. During this time the infant experiences very . The infant also has a lack of object perception. General symbolic function allows language and object permanence to develop.

2.	'''Pre-operational stage''' (Toddler and Early Childhood-2 to 7 years) The child's knowledge is dominated by the external world and its appearances. A child will only focus on one aspect of something at a time. The ability to carry out logical operations of the world is limited and the child lacks the understanding of categories.  Thought is still egocentric and the child has with conservation task, such as distinguishing the volume of water in different glasses. 

3.	'''Concrete operational stage''' (Elementary and early adolescence-7 to 11 years). In this stage, intelligence is demonstrated through logical and systematic manipulation of symbols related to concrete objects. Operational thinking develops and the child is able to do more activities at once. Egocentric thought diminishes. 

4.	'''Formal operational stage''' (Adolescence and adulthood-11 to 15 years). In this stage, intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts.  The ability to generate abstract propositions, multiple hypotheses and their possible outcomes is evident.  Ideas can be thought about mentally without concrete examples. Problems are approached in a systematic way and formal logical systems can be acquired.

====Criticisms of Piaget====

'''Lev Vygotsky (1896-1934)'''

The major theme of Vygotsky's theory is that language and thought start off as separate processes but gradually unite to influence each other through social learning that actually leads to cognitive development. Vygotsky's theory was an attempt to explain consciousness as the end product of socialization

Vygotsky (1978) states: &quot;Every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level; first, between people (interpsychological) and then inside the child (intrapsychological). This applies equally to voluntary attention, to logical memory, and to the formation of concepts. All the higher functions originate as actual relationships between individuals.&quot;  

According to Vygotsky, humans use tools that develop from a culture, such as speech and writing, to mediate their social environments. Initially children develop these tools to serve solely as social functions, ways to communicate needs. Vygotsky believed that the internalization of these tools led to higher thinking skills. When Piaget observed young children participating in egocentric speech in their preoperational stage, he believed it was a phase that disappeared once the child reached the stage of concrete operations. In contrast, Vygotsky viewed this egocentric speech as a transition from social speech to internalized thoughts.

Vygotsky's theory is that the potential for cognitive development depends upon the '''&quot;zone of proximal development&quot; (ZPD'''): a level of development attained when children engage in social behavior. Vygotsky describes it as &quot;the distance between the actual development level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers&quot; (Vygotsky, 1978). Full development of the ZPD depends upon full social interaction. The range of skill that can be developed with adult guidance or peer collaboration exceeds what can be 
attained alone. 

The importance of Vygotsky's theory is that it showed that Piaget had under emphasized the role of social factors in cognitive development. It also helped other psychologist, such as Bruner, to conduct more research to provide evidence for this theory. Overall, Vygotsky's theory has successfully been applied to education.

'''Jerome S. Bruner (1915- )'''

Bruner believed that learning is an active process in which learners construct new ideas or concepts based upon their current/past knowledge. The learner selects and transforms information, constructs hypotheses, and makes decisions, relying on a cognitive structure to do so. Cognitive structure (i.e., schema, mental models) provides meaning and organization to experiences and allows the individual to &quot;go beyond the information given&quot;. 
Bruner was more concerned with how knowledge was represented and organized as the child developed, and therefore proposed that there are '''modes of representation'''. He believed there were three different modes that allow the child to develop its thought process:

'''1.	The Enactive Mode''' (0 to 1 years) Bruner believed that babies represent or interact with the world through their actions and therefore knowledge is stored in the babies muscle memory.

'''2.	The Iconic Mode''' (1 to 6 years) This mode demonstrates knowledge developing through visual or auditory likeness or images. Children in this mode have difficulty thinking beyond these images as in categorizing the knowledge or understanding the relationships between objects.

'''3.	The Symbolic Mode''' (7 to adult) Bruner believed that during this mode children were able to encode the world in terms of information storing symbols, like the words of our language or numbers in mathematics. Then the information can be categorized and summarized so that it can be more readily altered and considered. Therefore children can think beyond the physical images of the iconic mode. 

Similar to Vygotsky, Bruner stressed the importance of education and social interaction as major influences upon cognitive development, and more specifically proposed that society provides language which gives us thought. Bruner believed that language is symbolic/logical/operational thought, and one can not occur without the other, which is opposite of Piaget's belief that language was simply a tool used to reflect and describe the underlying symbolic cognitive structures. Bruner rejected Piaget's theory that cognitive structures could only be developed through the child's individual maturation and interaction with the world, and proposed that language training can speed up cognitive development.

===Models of Memory===

====Dual Process Model of Memory====

In the dual process of memory there are two stores of memory, which are '''long term''' and '''short-term memory'''. In 1968 Atkinson and Shriffin proposed this two-process model of memory and how information was able to flow through these two stores. 
-Within this '''duel-process model''' there is also sensory memory that precedes short-term memory. 
-'''Sensory memory''' in this model is represented as what is used for what all sensory stimuli must go through in order for it to become part of one’s memory.
- Moreover, this model puts emphasis on rehearsal and the ability of a person to attend to the information that is incoming.
- Lastly, the dual process model of memory depicts how data is lost within sensory memory through information not being attended to, while data in STM can be lost via displacement and how in LTM data can be lost through interference. 

In this model, sensory input is received by the brain.  The brain then processes this information and &quot;pays attention&quot; to one type of information.  The rest of the sensory input is forgotten.  The input that is attended to is then sent to the short term memory, where it is either remembered for up to 20 seconds and forgotten or it is sent to the long term memory where it can stay for very long periods of time without ever having to refresh the memory of it.  This model explains why a person can only pay attention to so much during a period of time and remember what was going on later.

Research that supports the existence of a '''dual process model''' of memory would be cases of ''anterograde amnesia that Clive Wearing studied in 1988.'' From his research with this form of amnesia Wearing was able to make a firm distinction between STM and LTM. With anterograde amnesia those suffering from this amnesia are unable to retain information but for a certain period. Therefore, these people are trapped in a world purely based off of their STM and none of the data they have in their STM can be transferred to the LTM (due to damage to the hippocampus).  In addition to this research, free recall experiments really convey the difference between LTM and STM. The results of most of these experiments fall into a pattern known as the '''serial position curve.''' Participants are presented with a list of words, the serial position curve is a plot of the percentage of participants remembering each word, versus the position of that word in the list. The curve consists of the '''primacy effect''', an asymptote, and the recency effect. The primacy effect is a result of words from the beginning of the study to be recalled by the participant. Due to that it can be inferred that the participant was able to place that word into their STM and further rehearse those first words and in turn transfer that word into the LTM. The asymptote comes about when words from the middle of the free recall list are not able to be recalled. This is due primarily to the fact that there are too many words in the middle portion of this list, so the STM is able to hold that chunk of information long enough to rehearse and then transfer to the LTM. Lastly, the recency effect is based on the fact participants of these particular experiments are able to recall more words that are towards the end of the list. The pieces of information enter the STM and are not displaced for there is no new information to further displace this information. Thusly, participants are able to use this short-term-memory store to their advantage. (Murdock, 1962)
Murray Glanzer and Anita Cunitz (1966) tested the idea that rehearsal of the early words might lead to better memory by presenting the list at a slower pace, so there was more time between each word and participants had more time to rehearse. Just as hypothesized, if the primacy effect is due to rehearsal, increasing the time between each word increased memory for the early words (Glanzer et al., 1966). Superior memory for stimuli rpesented at the end of a sequence is called the recency effect, as discussed above (Murdoch, 1962). One possible explanation for the better memory for words at the end of the list is that the most recently presented words are still in short-term memory. To test this idea, Glanzer and Cunitz had their participants count backwards for 30 seconds right after hearing the last word item on the list. This counting prevented rehearsal from occurring and allowed time for information to be lost from short-term memory. The result therefore was as hypothesized - the delay caused by the counting eliminated the effect. Glanzer and Cunitz therefore concluded that the recency effect is due to storage of recently presented items in short-term memory; thereby showing better memory for words at the end of the serial position curve. The idea behind Glanzer and Cunitz's conclusions is that words that are rehearsed during the presentation of the list get transferred into long-term memory. But what is the evidence that short-term memory (working memory) and long-term memory are separate processes? In fact, there has been neuropsychological evidence that has shown that short-term memory (working memory) and long-term memory are actually two separate processes, occurring in two separate processing mechanisms, independently of each other in the sense that they each have divided allocated resources and capacities (see Clive Wearing's case, H.M.'s case, and K.F.'s case).

=====Limitations===== 
Some criticisms of this model are that it is too simplistic and under-emphasises interaction between the stores. Also, the STM and LTM are more complex and not as unitary as the dual-process model would lead some to believe. This criticism is supported by the '''Working memory model''' of STM by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) and by research into the '''semantic, episodic, imagery and procedural encoding''' of LTM. Lastly, some critics feel that '''rehearsal''' is too simple of a process to account for the transfer of information from the STM to the LTM. Levels of Processing (Craik and Lockhart, 1972) are the postulates that deal with how someone might go about retaining information.

====Levels of Processing====

When a person receives information what they do with it is as important as how the information is received. Craik and Lockhart argued against the predominant view of fixed memory stores and proposed that there were many different ways in which data can be retained. However both men came to a consensus on the fact that data is easier to transfer from STM to LTM when the data is understood and can be related to past memories. Craik and Lockhart felt that rehearsal was too simplistic and really did not allow for data to be stored into LTM. The longer data was processed and analyzed the longer the memory trace would last in the LTM. These psychologists were then able to establish three levels at which verbal data could be processed at. The three levels were '''structural, phonetic and semantic,''' and each had their own specific characteristic to aid in further memory retention. The structural processing level consisted of merely looking at how the words were structured or organized to gain some meaning. Analyzing a word through the phonetic level looked at how the word sound compared to another word in order to retain meaning. Semantic process looked at the meaning of the word, and this level of processing was the most effective compared to the other two. 

The levels that these men came up with were tested and proven true in 1975 by Craik and Tulving. In their study they tested the effect of depth of processing on memory by giving subjects words with questions that required the use of the different levels of processing. From the results the researchers were able to see that words that were remembered on the semantic level were recognized more frequently then words processed on the two other levels. Due to testing such as this many researchers began to wonder why deep processing occurred at all. In turn, modifications to the levels of processing were made, and some ways made all three levels equal in the ability in which it allowed people to retain information. '''Elaboration''' (Craik and Tulving, 1975) was one modification made and this particular modification found that complex semantic processing produced much more recall of words than simple semantic processing. '''Distinctiveness''' (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1980) showed how when words were processed phonetically recall would be better if the words were distinctive or unusual. The last two modifications were '''Effort''' (Tyler, 1979) and '''Personal Relevance''' (Rogers, 1977). '''Effort''' conveyed the idea that words would have better recall if words were presented as difficult antagrams, and '''Personal Relevance''' show that words had better recall if the words had a associative question that related to that specific participant.

=====Strengths and Limitations=====
The Evaluation of the Levels of Processing approach to memory is that there are strengths and weaknesses. The strengths are that it really has implications on what actually occurs during the process of learning. However, the word deep is very ambiguous and defining what deep can at times be difficult. Moreover, why deep processing is so effective is another mystery to many psychologists. Later it was found that Semantic processing does not always lead to better retrieval (Morris, 1977), which refutes this approaches findings and beliefs. Lastly, this approach describes rather than explains causing for negative judgment on the validity of this approach. 

====Working Memory Model of Memory====

As many people continued to argue against the '''dual process model of memory''', only few psychologists took the initiative to introduce new models based on memory.  However, Baddeley and Hitch (1974) were able to create the '''working model of memory''' to challenge the '''dual-processes model''' and its '''short-term memory store.''' 
Working memory is an active store that is conscious about its currents surroundings and separates into three specific components. Those three different components are '''the central executive, the phonological loop, and the visuospatial sketchpad'''. The '''central executive''' is the controlling mechanism, which must be very attentive due to its limited capacity, of the other two components and in essence is a modality free mechanism. The '''phonological loop''' consists of two subsystems, the articulatory control system and the phonological store. The articulatory control system is the ‘inner voice’ that uses verbal rehearsal in order to retain information. This system’s capacity is based on time, and ultimately the information in this system is data that we are preparing to speak or maintain for later use. The second part of the phonological loop, the phonological store is considered the ‘inner ear’ and is able to hold information as a phonological memory trace. This normally lasts for 1.5 to 2 seconds if it is not able to refresh via the the articualtory control system. Memory is also able to transfer from the sensory register of from the LTM into the phonological store. The '''visuospatial sketchpad''' is the ‘inner eye’ that holds visual and spatial information from either the sensory register or the LTM.

=====Evidence and Support=====
Evidence for this model of memory is shown in experiments that use concurrent tasks. In other words, two tasks are being performed at the same time. These tasks are able to show that the STM cannot be as simplistic as the dual-process makes it. With the use of concurrent tasks, different modalities must be used and thus the different components of the working memory model must be used separately.  These type of experiments further show that if one type of modality or one specific component is being used then another component that is similar in nature will be interfered with and non-functional. (Baddeley and Hitch, 1974)

=====Strengths and Limitations of the Work Memory Model=====
Evaluation of this model provides a more complex and thorough explanation of the first stages of memory storage than the STM does. This model is more generalizable to reading, mental arithmetic, and verbal reasoning. Moreover, the working model of memory makes of for where the STM lacks at when it comes to explaining brain damage patients (and their ability to use STM). However, with the numerous positives about this model the central executive component of the working model of memory seems to be unclear in terms of what its true function is.  


====Parallel Distributed Processing Model====

In the '''Parallel Distributed Processing Model''' the storage of memory is outlined a very different way. This model is the youngest out of all the previous models that have been discussed. It wasn’t until the 1980’s that this model truly came into favor. PDP is model that stresses the ''parallel nature of neural processing'', and the distributed nature of neural representations. Moreover, this model uses basic principles of technology as well as mathematics to its advantage in order to convey how memories are stored. As mentioned above the Parallel Distributed Processing Model is primarily made up of neural networks that interact to store memory. The two basic principles that this model follows are:

:1.	Any given mental state can be described as a (N)-dimensional vector of numeric activation values over neural units in a network. 
:2.	Memory is created by modifying the strength of the connections between neural units. 


The connection strengths, or &quot;weights&quot;, are generally represented as a (N×N)-dimensional matrix
These principles are created based on the idea of connectionism, which the PDP model is a huge representation of. Connectionism is the approach in cognitive science, which aims to model mental or behavior phenomena as interconnected networks that consists of simple units.  The framework in which the PDP model works in consists of: 
:•	A set of processing units, represented by a set of integers. 
:•	An activation for each unit, represented by a vector of time-dependent functions. 
:•	An output function for each unit, represented by a vector of functions on the activations. 
:•	A pattern of connectivity among units, represented by a matrix of real numbers indicating connection strength. 
:•	A propagation rule spreading the activations via the connections, represented by a function on the output of the units. 
:•	An activation rule for combining inputs to a unit to determine its new activation, represented by a function on the current activation and propagation. 
:•	A learning rule for modifying connections based on experience, represented by a change in the weights based on any number of variables. 
:•	An environment which provides the system with experience, represented by sets of activation vectors for some subset of the units. 
This framework is purely mathematically based and allows all the researchers that work with this model to operate within the PDP model with ease. 

=====Support=====
Evidence for this model has been generally accepted in psychology. Some studies that have been done sought to distinguish the priming effect and the PDP as a valid storage of memory. These types of studies were in laboratory settings and were based upon recalling information back that had already been given. More evidence that was gained from these tests were that the priming is due to spreading activation of information. ( Mcclelland and Rumelhart, 1985) Data for this model has also been collected through computer simulation. It is evidence of this kind that really meets the disapproval of other psychologists in the cognitive field. The major questions that these psychologists asked is how can this computer generated data truly relate to something in the human realm. In addition, some believe that human thought is more systemic than the PDP will allow. These psychologists further state that computers are not able to correctly display behavior that humans can.(Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988)

Evaluations of this model for the most part are that it is very effective. This model puts an emphasis on learning and other phenomena of memory. Moreover, although there is testing on computers, another key part to the data collected is in laboratory settings. In turn Connectionist psychologists are able to validate their data to the real world. However, these men have been unable to provide clear predictions and explanations about recall and recognition memory and how the PDP model is able to account for this.

How Has the advent of Parallel Distribution Model impacted the legitamacy of other memory models?

What are some of the stregnths and limitations of lab prepared research?

===Types of Memory===
:'''Procedural''':  This type of memory refers to our knowledge of how to do something rather than something that has happened.  Examples usually include skills, such as knowing how to walk, talk, write or ride a bike.  While we may have episodic memories of learning how to ride a bike, these memories need not be recalled every time we ride a bike.  Compared with the other types of memory, procedural memory is highly resistant to forgetting as well as to brain damage that can harm other types of memory.  Patients suffering from amnesia forget many of their past experiences but often do not forget how to speak or write.

:'''Declarative Memory''':  This type of memory refers to knowledge of facts and concepts as well as specific events.  Declarative memory is divided into two categories; episodic and semantic.
	
:'''Episodic''':  This category of memory refers to our recall of specific events which are connected to a place and time.  This type of memory is what is referred to when someone talks about remembering something with your “mind’s eye.” 
::An example of a type of episodic memory is a '''flashbulb memory''' of a dramatic or traumatic event, such as the World Trade Center falling or the death of Princess Diana.  Researchers Brown and Kulik argued that a special neural mechanism is triggered by such an event, especially if the event is shocking and has emotional repercussions (1977).  These memories are generally permanent and many specific detail can be recalled from them, such as the place where the news was heard.

:'''Semantic''':  This type of memory refers to abstract ideas and general knowledge, regardless of any context in relation to time or location of when the memory was stored.  Examples include: knowing the meaning of words, learning facts from a text book and placing objects into categories.

Some scientists believe that the different types of memory are stored in different parts of the brain.  Wheeler et.al (1997) reported that out of 26 PET scan studies, 25 studies showed more brain activity in the right prefrontal cortex during episodic memory retrieval than during semantic memory retrieval.

===Memory Processes===

:'''Encoding''':  This refers to the processing of information for storage in either the short term or long term memory. Information must be processed so that it can easily be retrieved later.

:'''Storage''':  Not all of the sensory information that we perceive actually enters into our memory.  Only that sensory information that we attend to is sent to our sensory memory.  The more relevant information is encoded and stored in the short term memory while the rest is filtered out to simplify our memory processing.  Information that is repeated in the short term memory is more likely to then be encoded into the long tem memory along with information that is more personally relevant. Craig and Lockhart (1972) determined that: 1.the deeper the processing, the more memorable
2. deeper levels on analyisis produce stronger and longer lasting memory traces than shallow levels of analysis. 

:'''Retrieval''':  This is what we do when we remember something from our long term memory.  Information is not retrieved from our short term memory because short term memory is only held there until it can be sent to the long term memory.  Short term memory is attended to until it is either forgotten or sent to the long term memory.  According to the '''primacy effect''' the first few items on a list are better recalled than the middle ones because people have more time to rehearse the first few items, therefore encoding it into the long-term store (Atkinson and Shiffrin, 1968).

===Early Memory Research===

:'''Herman Ebbinghaus''' was a German psychologist and one of the earliest researchers of memory. He tested the long term memory by memorizing nonsense syllables [consonant-vowel-consonant trigrams which do not spell any word in any language]. Ebbinghaus conducted this experiment by reading a list of about twenty nonsense syllables; reading each one first then saying it aloud to himself. He followed this procedure for each word and spent the same amount of time on each nonsense syllable as well. His results showed that the memory was forgotten at a higher rate after the first hour and the forgetting rate increased at a slower rate thereafter. This is referred to as the '''forgetting curve'''. 
:Ebbinghaus also came up with the '''learning curve''' where he tried to recall 20 sets of nonsense syllables on a list.  The more he repeated the series, the more he could remember until finally he recalled the whole list.  However, his theory is somewhat negated by Craig and Lockhart (1972) who found that elaborative rehearsal (the depth of understanding and processing) better determined memorability than just maintenance rehearsal (simple repetition).
:Ebbinghaus also determined what is coined as the '''overlearning effect'''. According to Ebbinghaus, being able to recall [in this case the twenty nonsense syllables] perfectly, two times in a row constitutes as mastering the subject. Therefore, Ebbinghouse concluded that when a person continues to memorize material, he or she is “overlearning” because she or he has already succeeded in mastering the material. When “overlearning” occurs, the forgetting curve becomes shallower and it takes more time for material to be forgotten.
Ebbinghaus invented several tests of retention such as:
:''RECALL'' -- simply try to remember each item. Ebbinghaus used two types of recall task: 
:-FREE RECALL -- attempt to recall the list items; order is not important. 
:-SERIAL RECALL -- attempt to recall the list items in the order studied. 
:''RECOLLECTION'' – subjects are given a large list of nonsense syllables and try to recognize which of them had been on the list studied. This technique is usually a simpler test of memory than recall because a person may be able to recognize an item from the prompter [the list] that he or she could not recall from memory alone. 
:''SAVINGS'' -- rememorize the list (usually used after a long retention interval, when neither recall nor recognition gives much evidence of prior learning). Compare the number of repetitions required to learn the list the first time to the number required the second time. Savings is the most helpful test of memory, as it will indicate some remaining effect of previous learning even when recall and recognition don’t.

:'''Frederick Bartlett''' was a British psychologist and professor at University of Cambridge.  His major contributions to the study of memory include research into reconstructive memory.  Bartlett theorized that we do not passively memorize information but rather we try to make sense of memories and store them in a way that makes sense based on what we already know.  In this sense, he presumed that we may often remember events or information incorrectly because we remember what we think should have happened or remember what we prefer to remember.  He referred to this as “effort after meaning.”  Bartlett’s research tested British subject’s recall of an unfamiliar North American Folk story titled “The War of the Ghosts.”  Due to many cultural differences, subjects tended to recall he story incorrectly because they tried to alter the story to make it more coherent and omitted the details that were unfamiliar.

This article will address the symptoms and theories about anxiety disorders

==Contents==
Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders have different causes which can be unique to the individual.  The anxiety disorder may be present from childhood and worsen in times of high stress, or there may be a triggering event like a parent dying or a spouse leaving.  
Scientists have developed several theories as to why these anxiety disorders have appeared.  Biologists believe that genetics and evolution play a part in the development.  They believe that genetics predispose a person to having such a disorder.  This belief is supported by studies with twins and other relatives.  There is a high rate of monozygotic (identical) twins both having an anxiety disorder, dizygotic (fraternal) twins have a much lower rate of concordance.  Also people’s whose mother, father, or sibling has had a panic attack are ten times more likely to experience a panic attack than those who do not have a relative with panic attacks.  Phobias can be good for evolutionary reasons and can help survival.  Snakes, heights and dark are dangerous and have been around for thousands of years.  They are subjects of common phobias.  However, guns and cars are also dangerous and detrimental to survival, but they are modern, and are not common human phobias.
There are several types of anxiety disorders which include phobias, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

'''Generalized Anxiety Disorder'''

Affects women twice as much as men.  The person affected by GAD experiences fear, anxiety, or worry over an unspecified event or object. They do not know what is causing the anxiety.  The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM IV) states that the diagnosis of GAD involves:
*Excessive, and difficult to control, worry and anxiety.
*Significant distress and distress.
*Worry occurring more days than not for at least 6 months.
*Worry not involving another disorder (e.g. depression).
Other symptoms may also be shown such as:
*restlessness and irritability,
*muscle tension, rapid physical fatigue, and sleep disturbance,
*concentration problems.

'''Phobias'''

The person suffering from a phobia has a strong and irrational fear of something or some event.  Their reaction to the feared object/situation is disproportionate to the danger the object/situation poses.  The fear they feel includes the expectation of impending harm, release of adrenaline and activation of the nervous system, feelings of dread, terror, and panic, and fleeing or freezing (fight or flight).  The symptoms of a phobic disorder are sometimes obvious enough to make diagnosis easy.  For example, a phobia of wasps is visible when someone is physically and mentally scared of wasps - yet social phobia is harder to diagnose as it often links with insecurity complexes, claustrophobia, agoraphobia and many other psychological problems.
*Persistent fear of a specific situation out of proportion to the reality of the danger.
*Compelling desire to avoid and escape the situation.
*Recognition that the fear is unreasonably excessive.
*Symptoms not due to another disorder.
Phobics may also perceive their disorder to be beyond their control and wish to be rid of it; however, with one exception, the phobic’s everyday functioning is unimpaired.
Although there are many types of phobias, e.g. heights, enclosed places, or strangers/foreigners, they fall into three categories:
Agoraphobia – involves fear of places of assembly, crowds, and open spaces and is the most prevalent of all phobias and occurs most often in women in early adulthood.
Social phobias – involve fear of being observed doing something humiliating, generally beginning in adolescence.  Problems such as reluctancy to talk to people, fear of talking to people on the phone, being unable to cope in situations where you don't know people, can often be a sign of social anxiety or social phobia.
Specific phobias – three subtypes: 1) fear of animals (e.g. spiders, rats, and snakes), 2) fear inanimate objects (darkness, heights, enclosed spaces), 3) fear of illness (injury, death, disease). 

'''OCD'''

OCD is a debilitating disorder that does not seem to favor men or women.  At least five of the nine criteria listed in the DSM IV must be met for OCD to be diagnosed. These criteria include:
* Either obsession or compulsion must be experienced. 
** Obsessions are defined by the DSM IV as:
*** recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images that are experienced, at least initially, as intrusive and senseless, e.g., a parent's having repeated impulses to kill a loved child, a religious person's having recurrent blasphemous thoughts
*** the person attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts or impulses or to neutralize them with some other thought or action 
*** the person recognizes that the obsessions are the product of his or her own mind, not imposed from without (as in thought insertion) 
**Compulsions are defined in the DSM IV as:
*** repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors that are performed in response to an obsession, or according to certain rules or in a stereotyped fashion 
*** the behavior is designed to neutralize or to prevent discomfort or some dreaded event or situation; however, either the activity is not connected in a realistic way with what it is designed to neutralize or prevent, or it is clearly excessive
*** the person recognizes that his or her behavior is excessive or unreasonable (this may not be true for young children; it may no longer be true for people whose obsessions have evolved into overvalued ideas) 
***B. The obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming (take more than an hour a day), or significantly interfere with the person's normal routine, occupational functioning, or usual social activities or relationships with others.

Jeffery Shwartz believes that the obsessions and compulsions are products of what he calls &quot;brain lock.&quot;  He describes this as the same neurons being fired over and over again in the same pattern, which causes the persistent thoughts and actions.  He finds that the best treatment of OCD is what is known as Cognitive-behavioral therapy.  In this therapy, the patient completes the Four Step Regimen of relabeling, reattributing, refocusing, and revaluing.  By completing these four steps, the patient has trained him- or herself to overcome some of his or her obsessions and compulsions. 

'''Panic Disorder'''

A panic attack is very disruptive to the sufferers life - and chronic suffering of panic attacks is known as Panic Disorder. It can be brought on by facing a phobia, high stress environments or a situation where the sufferer is unsure or nervous.  The symptoms are cross-cultural, but the immediate causes are limited by the culture, such as driving a car - cars are not in every culture.  The sufferer may experience:
*restlessness and irritability
*muscle tension, rapid physical fatigue and sleep disturbances
*concentration problems
*heart palpitations, cold sweats, nausea
*irregular breathing, dizziness and in severe cases, Hypoxia.

According to the DSM IV, diagnosis of a panic attack includes:
*a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, reaching a peak within 10 minutes
*at least four of the thirteen symptoms listed in the DSM IV occur rapidly.

'''PTSD'''

PTSD is a very common disorder affecting veterans and victims of violent crime.  The DSM IV states that diagnosis of PTSD involves:
*exposure to a traumatic event that was responded to with fear, helplessness, or horror
*and the prevalence of the following symptoms for at least one month:
**the traumatic event is persistently re-lived through flashbacks, dreams, intrusive memories, etc.
**persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma
**numbing of general responsiveness
**persistent symptoms of increased arousal, such as difficulty sleeping, anger outbursts, exaggerated startle response, difficulty concentrating.

This article will focus on the symptoms and theories surrounding mood disorders

==Content==
9% of the population will experience a mood disorder at sometime in their lives.  There are two categories of mood disorders: unipolar depression and bipolar depression.  Major unipolar depression is much more likely to occur than bipolar depression (5x more likely), and is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental illnesses.  Mania, the other &quot;pole&quot; of bipolar depression, can be experienced on by itself.  The difference between people with mood disorders and &quot;normal&quot; people are the degree, severity, and duration of moods.

'''Unipolar Depression'''

There is a 5% lifetime risk of developing a form of unipolar depression.  It is seen cross-culturally, but is diagnosed twice as often for women than as for men.

The DSM IV states that for diagnosis to be made the person must:
*have a depressed mood
*or have a loss of pleasure
*and experience these four symptoms during the same two-week period
**Emotional Symptoms
***intense feelings of sadness or guilt
***lack of enjoyment or pleasure in activities the individual once loved
**Motivational Symptoms
***Passivity
***difficulty in initiating action and making a decision
**Cognitive Symptoms
***frequent negative thoughts
***blaming oneself
***low self-esteem
***irrational hopelessness
**Somatic Symptoms
***loss of energy
***restlessness
***increased/decreased appetite
***weight loss/gain
***insomnia/hypersomnia

Some types of unipolar depression include:
*Major Depressive Episodes
*Dysthymia - chronic mild depression occurring over a period of at least two years, where a depressed mood and symptoms are experienced either most of the day, more days than not, or without a break of more than two months in the two year period.
*Seasonal Affective Disorder - mood systematically varies with the seasonal changes of the year, often involving depression during the winter months. (if the sufferer also feels mania during the summer or other time during the year, then his or her form of SAD is classified as bipolar depression).
*Mania - mood disorder of symptoms of full blown mania without periods of intense depression.  The manic symptoms must last at least a week and must interfere with social and occupational functioning.

'''Bipolar Depression'''

There is a 1% chance of developing a form of bipolar depression.  It is much more strongly linked to genetics than unipolar depression is.

Bipolar Depression includes the symptoms of unipolar depression followed by a period of mania, or hypomania (a shorter, less severe period of mania).
The DSM IV states that a manic episode must involve 
*a &quot;distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood lasting at least a week&quot;
*at least three of the following symptoms
**Emotional Symptoms
***abnormally euphoric, elevated, or irritable mood
***increased pleasure in activities
**Motivational Symptoms
***Increase in goal-directed activity
***increase in pleasurable activities that have a high risk of painful cpnsequences
**Cognitive Symptoms
***inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
***racing ideas or thoughts
***lack of attention (easily distracted)
**Somatic Symptoms
***decreased need for sleep
***psychomotor agitation
***more talkative
*rapid and pressured speech

Types of Bipolar Depression include:
*Bipolar Depression
*Cyclothymia - bipolar equivalent of dysthmia.  Mood disorder where the sufferer has periods of mild depression followed by hypomania for more than two years.
*Seasonal Affective Disorder

'''Theories explaining mood disorders'''

Cognitive Theory

Seligman’s experiments with learned helplessness in dogs led him to believe people suffering from depression: 1. blame themselves instead of the situation, 2. situation as unchangeable, 3. failure inevitable.  

Similar ideas have been expressed by Aaron Beck through his cognitive triad theory about self, situation, and future.  Beck believed depression is caused by errors in logic including distortions in thought processes, overgeneralization, and personalization.

Neuro-chemical theory

Depression has been linked to disruptions in the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin.  This research has been strengthened by the success of some drugs in treating depression, notably the use of SSRIs to block the reuptake of serotonin in the limbic system.  Lithium carbonate has been successfully used in treating bipolar depression, creating strong links to biological causes for bipolar depression as well.

Genetics

Katz and McGuffin (1993) studies using monozygotic twins estimates that about 52% of unipolar depression variance is due to genetics, while the variance is about 80% in bipolar disorder.  This study suggests a very strong correlation between bipolar depression and genetics.

Environment

Depression occurs most often in women who are “working class, house bound with three or more children.”  Stress and little emotional support can increase the possibility of the onset of depression.  Season change correlates with the onset of depression, with more cases being reported during the winter months.

Interaction theories

Weiss and Simson’s (1985) study showed that rats exhibiting learned helplessness behavior have significant decreases in the activity of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Information and Causes==
According to the DSM-IV-TR, a '''personality disorder''' is an “enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectation of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress or impairment.”  The same definition can also apply to the schizophrenias.
Personality disorders affect personality, namely relationships, social function, and mental abilities. The disorders are often on a spectrum, ranging from mild to severe cases.  Those who suffer from very mild personality disorders lead normal lives.  However, interference of the symptoms in livelihood normally arise after periods of high stress or external pressure and can lead to impairments in emotional, psychological, and social functioning.

The disorders are characterized by disturbances in:&lt;br&gt;
*	Self-image
*	The ability to have successful personal relationships
*Appropriateness of range of emotion
*	Self-perception, world-perception, and the perception of others, and
*	Impulse control

The combination of these creates the personality disorder, which leads to the exhibition of external behaviors that differ from societal norms.  This is why people who suffer from personality disorders have bad relationships with other people in society.   

Personality disorders can be caused by a variety of different factors, including – but not limited to – upbringing, personality and social development, and genetic and biological factors.  However, because the symptoms arise during times of high stress, treatment centers on coping mechanisms. 

Furthermore, Dr. Sam Vaknin has stated that there are commonalities between those who suffer from personality disorders.  These are self-centeredness, the presence of a victim mentality, a lack of empathy, the presence of manipulative or exploitative behavior, depression, a vulnerability or susceptibility to other mental disorders, a distorted or superficial understanding of self and others’ perceptions, a need to force the world to conform to the needs of the sufferer, and no delusions/hallucinations or thought disorders (except for periods in Borderline Personality Disorder).

==Examples==

There are ten personality disorders listed in the DSM-IV:

*''Antisocial Personality Disorder''
**     Called sociopaths or psychopaths, these people show a lack of regard for the standards of local culture and do not get along with other people or abide by commonly accepted societal rules and regulations.

*''Avoidant personality disorder''
**    Socially inhibited with feelings of inadequacy and sensitivity to criticism.

*''Borderline Personality Disorder''
**     Marked by rapid changes in mood and unstable relationships.  Sufferers tend to lack in identity.

*''Dependent Personality Disorder''
**     The sufferer is unable to act on his or her own, but has to rely upon other people.  These people have little or no self-confidence and fear separation and are often submissive.

*''Histrionic Personality Disorder''
**     The person is overtly emotional in inappropriate ways and circumstances and is almost theatrical in nature.  The emotions exhibited shift rapidly and without warning.

*''Narcissistic Personality Disorder''
**     Lacking empathy and having the need to be admired by others, these people often ignore other people and are hypersensitive to criticism.

*''Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder''
**     The perfectionists with an inability to change from habit, also having an uncontrollable pattern of thought or action.

*''Paranoid Personality Disorder''
**     Having distrust of others with the feeling that others are plotting to or are in the process of causing harm to the sufferer.  The patients have the inability to forgive, which undermines any personal relationships.

*''Schizoid Personality Disorder''
**     Limited range of emotion and showing indifference toward other people.

*''Schizotypal Personality Disorder''
**     Extreme non-conformity to the point where eccentricity is harmful to the sufferer or others (belief in having magic powers leading to physical harm, etc.) or eliminates personal relationships.  Eccentricity can be exhibited through appearance, behavior, or relationship style.

==Treatment==

Treatment cannot deal with causes because the causes are not definite.  Common treatments are therapy sessions in which the patient is taught to take control of his or her life to change or act in a different way toward a specific behavior.  Therefore, it is said that the sufferer must want to make the change for themselves in order to be healed.  In such therapy sessions, psychosocial or Freudian techniques are implemented in order to determine whether or not the disorder stems from childhood trauma; then, cognitive-behavioral therapy is used.  Often, a support system of therapy, familial and friendly support, and medication is used to further assist in treating personality disorders.

===General Information===
'''Schizophrenia''', a term coined by Eugen Bleuler in 1911 by combining the Greek words for &quot;split&quot; and &quot;mind,&quot; is &quot;a group of disorders characterized by loss of contact with reality, marked disturbances of thought and perception, and bizarre behavior.&quot; &lt;ref&gt; From Atkinson, ''Introduction to Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;  Hallucinations and/or delusions are also coupled with the disorders.  Onset of schizophrenia usually occurs during the adolescent years during puberty, possibly due to the apoptosis that occurs throughout that time, or in early adulthood.  In men, the disorder occurs in the late teens or early 20s; women, in the mid-20s to early 30s.  Rare cases occur after the age of 45 or before puberty.  Often, the symptoms that occur during the teen years can be attributed to normal teen behavior, so a diagnosis is difficult during that period of time.  The disease was first identified by Emil Kraeplin in 1896, who said that the disorder, then named &quot;''dementia praecox'',&quot; was a premature deterioration of the brain that occurred early in life and continued throughout. &lt;ref&gt; From Atkinson, ''Introduction to Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Bleuler found in 1911 that the disorders stemmed from initial deterioration, but the deterioration did not continue.  That is, the patients &quot;stabilize[d] and remain[ed] at the same point in their psychosis for extended periods of time.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;From purgatory.net&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, schizophrenia is a debilitating and burdensome disorder that impacts the lives of about one percent of the world's population.

===Symptoms===
The symptoms of schizophrenia are categorized into three sections: positive, negative, and cognitive.   Of the three, positive symptoms are easier to recognize, but cognitive symptoms are the most harmful to the livelihood of the sufferer as they prevent the patient from participating effectively in the workplace or in society.  Negative symptoms, on the other hand, can be misinterpreted as depression or laziness.  However, schizophrenics are not usually violent unless substance abuse is involved or if the patient is a paranoid schizophrenic, in which case, the violence occurs in the home.&lt;ref&gt;The National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt;  Schizophrenics are more likely to attempt suicide, 10 percent of which succeed.

====Positive Symptoms====
Any behavior not seen in healthy people that correlate with a loss of contact with reality.  These include:
*Hallucinations - perceiving a sensory stimuli that no one else can.  In schizophrenia, sufferers most often hear voices that tell them what to do, warn of danger, or talk to each other about the patient. &lt;ref&gt;The National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt;
*Delusions - false beliefs that are not of the culture of the patient that are unchanging even after being proven incorrect. The type of delusion depends on the type of schizophrenia.  Those who suffer from '''paranoid schizophrenia''' have delusions that other people want to harm them (called &quot;delusions of persecution&quot;), &lt;ref&gt;The National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other schizophrenics may think themselves famous or that the television is communicating with them.
*Thought Disorder - unusual thought processes.  This is characterized by disorganized thinking, problems articulating, sudden loss of thought, and the formation of unintelligible words.
*Disorders of Movement - lack of coordination.  Disorders of movement can range from involuntary movements to catatonia.  Thanks to newer treatments, catatonic states due to schizophrenia are rare.

====Negative Symptoms====
Any behavior that healthy people have that is lacking in the non-healthy person.  These include:
*Monotony in tone and facial expression
*Lack of pleasure in life
*Lacking initiative in activities
*Infrequent vocal interaction with others
*Neglect of hygiene, which leads to the misconception that the sufferer is lazy or does not want to take care of him/herself to better the life.  Therefore, negative symptoms alone are not perceived as a psychiatric illness.

====Cognitive Symptoms====
Subtle differences in cognitive ability that are normally only discovered after neuropsychological tests are given.  Examples are:
*Poor ability to absorb and act upon information ('''executive functioning''')
*Lack of attention
*An inability to utilize '''working memory'''

===Possible Causes===
As with all psychological theories on disorders or brain function, schizophrenia can be a result of a natural or nurtured environment.  The root causes of the disorder are unknown; however, research is always being conducted to determine them.

====Genetic Factors====
Schizophrenia runs in families.  The chances of a person in the general populace of having the disorder are 1 in 100.  If a person has a parent, brother, or sister with schizophrenia, the chance increases to 60%.  An increase also occurs if grandparents, aunts, uncles, or cousins have the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;The National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt;  An identical twin has the most risk(45 to 65 percent).  While this research can be evidence enough that the disorder has a basis in genetics, there is no way to determine who would have the disorder through gene mapping.  Even so, a genes are not believed to be enough to cause the disease; therefore, it is assumed that the environment plays a role as well.  Common ideas for the environmental factors are viral exposure or malnutrition in the womb, complications during birth, or stressful psychosocial conditions.

====Brain Chemistry and Structure====
Research into the role of neurotransmitters and schizophrenia is still somewhat new and is a &quot;promising area of research.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed now that '''dopamine''' and '''glutamate''' play a role in schizophrenia, and further research is needed to determine if other chemicals are involved.

Schizophrenic brains are slightly different than normal brains.  The ventricles - fluid-filled cavities in the center of the brain - are larger.  Also, the volume of '''gray matter''' is lower and metabolic activity is lessened.

Further research has shown that the damage done to the brain is prenatal because '''glial cells''' are not present, which should be present if an injury occurred after birth.  This supports the hypothesis that the original cause of the disorder occurs before birth, but lies dormant until the brain changes during puberty.

===Types and Classes of Schizophrenia===
*Catatonic Type
**Patients may exhibit catatonia (rare), but all behaviors are just as extreme.  '''Catalepsy''' or &quot;waxy flexibility&quot; may occur, when the sufferer rearranges their posture and holds it for periods of time.  Mimicking of sounds ('''echolalia''') or movements ('''echopraxia''') of others often occurs.  Patients can also explode into manic patterns of repetitious movements that have no purpose.  
**This type of schizophrenia has almost been eliminated thanks to modern medicine.
*Disorganized Type
**Patients are unable to communicate due to problems with thinking or speaking.  Also, patients with this type are eccentric in style and mannerisms.
*Paranoid Type
**Hallucinations or delusions of personal persecution are prevalent, but cognitive function is intact.  The patient seems normal until suspicions become entangling.  
**Paranoid schizophrenia is considered to be the most debilitating.
*Residual Type
**There is a previous diagnosis of schizophrenia, but prominent symptoms are absent. Some symptoms remain, including eccentricity or social withdrawal.
**One episode of schizophrenia must have occurred.  Hallucinations may be present, but they are not strong.
*Undifferentiated Type
**These patients exhibit some psychotic symptoms, but do not fall into any subcategory of schizophrenia.  They are considered to definitely have the disorder.
*Schizophreniform Disorder
**A schizophrenic &quot;episode&quot; that lasts for more than two weeks but less than six months.  The patient is likely to move back into society.

===Treatment===
Because the root cause is unknown, treatment focuses on the symptoms.  

'''Antipsychotic drugs''' have been largely used for treatment since the 1950s and assist with the positive symptoms.  Such drugs include haloperidol, clozapine, or resperidone, among others.  Even though the drugs improve quality of life, the side effects were disruptive as well.  The older drugs - haloperidol among them - caused rigidity, muscle spasms, tremors, or restlessness.  Clozapine, the second in the round of medication, did not cause the aforementioned symptoms, but did cause a reduction in white blood cells, resulting in the need for costly repetitive blood tests.  The third set did not cause any previous set of symptoms, but did cause weight gain and, in some cases, high cholesterol and diabetes.  Because schizophrenia is a chronic disease, the medication would have to be taken for life.

'''Psychosocial treatments''' are for patients who are on a stable medication.  Patients learn coping mechanisms to deal with symptoms that hold them back from participating in daily social activity.  Studies have shown that patients who regularly attend psychosocial sessions are less likely to relapse and are more likely to stay on a medication schedule. &lt;ref&gt;The National Institute of Mental Health&lt;/ref&gt;  Types of sessions include illness management skills, integrated treatment for substance abuse, rehabilitation, '''cognitive behavioral therapy,''' family education, and self-help groups.

Culture plays a vast role in psychology.  Psychology being a soft science, the perceptions are subjective across cultures and, therefore, so do the treatments of abnormal disorders.  However, abnormality is also subjective in that cultural beliefs define what is normal and what is not.

In the Western world, psychologists use the '''DSM-IV''' as a guideline to determine what abnormality is.  However, the DSM-IV is not valid in other parts of the world and, as such do not include disorders that are localized in non-Western areas.  The '''ICD-10''', however, does include a section on &quot;Other specified neurotic disorders&quot; that include some frequent CBSs, or Culture-Bound Syndromes, including the Dhat syndrome of Indian-Hindu cultures, Koro of the Chinese culture, and Latah.

To analyze the treatments used in the West and the East and compare them, it is necessary to determine the cultural definitions of abnormality.

===Cultural Definitions of Abnormality===
====Culture Bound Syndromes====
Gross (1995) stated that there are universal norms for disorders across cultures, but that the symptoms vary in ways that make them culturally exclusive.  The symptoms vary in three ways:
*the form of the symptoms
*the reason for onset
*the prognosis of recovery

Still, there are some disorders that are exclusive to a particular area or section.  These are '''Culture-Bound Syndromes'''.  In order for a disorder to be considered culturally bound, the pattern of symptoms must,
*not belong to classifications for universal disorders as outlined by the DSM-IV and the ICD-10
*occur '''exclusively''' in specific geographic areas or populations, and 
*have a name in that area or population.
Neither the DSM-IV nor the ICD-10 contain extensive diagnostic criteria for such syndromes, which allude to the '''cultural-bias''' that is prevalent in cultural treatment.
Pfieffer (1982) concluded that CBSs did exist by stating that such syndromes did not fit into accepted diagnostic criteria and to force fit them would lead to dicounting or ignoring of other, important symptoms.  Furthermore, the triggers of the symptoms may not exist in other areas of the world and, therefore, are only available in a certain area.  Lastly, the disorder '''''may only be seen as a disorder in a specific area due to cultural beliefs''''' and may not be viewed as abnormal in other areas.

However, Yap (1974) and Berry (1992) disagree that CBSs exist.  These researchers suggest that symptoms only differ slightly from symptoms listed in diagnostic manuals and exist in other cultures rather than just the specific one being studied.  Finally, they argue that the same general mechanism is the cause of the syndrome and is therefore no different than any disorder listed in the DSM-IV or ICD-10. 

Examples of CBSs include:
*Koro
*Dhat
*Amok
*Kuru
*Pibloktoq

===Treatment in Non-Western Cultures===
====Biological====
Biological factors are not considered to be the cause of abnormality differences across culture because the basic brain structure of humans is the same worldwide.  Therefore, it is believed that cultural stimuli are more influential in determining prevalence, types of symptoms, and prognosis.
====Cultural/Environmental====
'''Learning''' is believed to be the most prevalent reason for abnormal differences across culture.  Societies differ in culture and enviornment, and therefore those factors are seen to be the major differences between two specific cultures.

For instance, expression of symptoms varies across cultures due to differences in technology.  In the United States and the United Kingdom, for example, schizophrenics believed that messages were being sent to them through radios, satellites, or microwaves.  In remote countries with large spiritual backgrounds, like Nigeria,  the belief is that someone cast an evil spell upon the sufferer.  In such areas, schizophrenics are more prone to act in a paranoid fashion and show more acute signs of paranoid schizophrenia.  Therefore, treatment must center around such feelings or beliefs, perhaps by using religious or spiritual beliefs to do so.  However, remote areas are better for schizophrenics, as the community of people is much stronger and provides the type of support system that they need.  

Stress also plays a role, but because stressors are different, the treatment depends on eradicating different types of stress, especially by religious or spiritual meditation that would not be seen in Western cultures.  

====Diagnostic Differences====
Diagnostic differences can be most attributed to the &quot;medicalization&quot; of Western treatments versus the &quot;spiritualization&quot; of non-Western ones.  Considerably, in Western society - as opposed to non-Western - the idea that sufferers can be treated and helped allows for diagnosis and treatment.  However, in non-Western areas, the sufferer is seen as an abomination; one that is unwell in the physical and spiritual sense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Review of Reaction Stoichiometry ==

Up until now, all of the balances we have done on systems have been in terms of '''mass'''. However, mass is inconvenient for a reacting system because it does not allow us to take advantage of the ''stoichiometry'' of the reaction in relating the relative amounts of reactants and of products. 

'''Stoichiometry''' is the relationship between reactants and products in a balanced reaction as given by the ratio of their coefficients. For example, in the reaction:

&lt;math&gt; C_2H_2 + 2H_2 \rightarrow C_2H_6 &lt;/math&gt;

the reaction stoichiometry would dictate that for every '''one''' molecule of &lt;math&gt; C_2H_2 &lt;/math&gt; (acetylene) that reacts, two molecules of &lt;math&gt; H_2 &lt;/math&gt; (hydrogen) are consumed and one molecule of &lt;math&gt; C_2H_6 &lt;/math&gt; are formed. However, '''this does not hold for grams of products and reactants'''. 

Even though the number of molecules in ''single substance'' is proportional to the mass of that substance, the constant of proportionality (the molecular mass) is not the same for every molecule. Hence, it is necessary to use the molecular weight of each molecule to convert from grams to ''moles'' in order to use the reaction's coefficients.

== Molecular Mole Balances ==

We can write balances on moles like we can on anything else. We'll start with our ubiquitous general balance equation:

&lt;math&gt; Input - Output = Accumulation - Generation &lt;/math&gt;

As usual we assume that accumulation = 0 in this book so that:

&lt;math&gt; Input - Output + Generation = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Let us denote molar flow rates by &lt;math&gt; \dot{n} &lt;/math&gt; to distinguish them from mass flow rates. We then have a similar equation to the mass balance equation:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \dot{n}_{in} - \Sigma \dot{n}_{out} + n_{gen} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;}}

The same equation can be written in terms of each individual species. 

There are a couple of important things to note about this type of balance as opposed to a mass balance:

# Just like with the mass balance, in a mole balance, a non-reactive system has &lt;math&gt; n_{gen} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all species.
# '''Unlike the mass balance''', the TOTAL generation of moles isn't necessarily 0 even for the overall mole balance! To see this, consider how the total number of moles changes in the above reaction; the final number of moles will not equal the initial number because 3 total moles of molecules are reacting to form 1 mole of products.

Why would we use it if the generation isn't necessarily 0? We use the molecular mole balance because '''if we know how much of any one substance is consumed or created in the reaction, we can find all of the others from the reaction stoichiometry'''. This is a very powerful tool because ''each reaction only creates one new unknown'' if you use this method! The following section is merely a formalization of this concept, which can be used to solve problems involving reactors.

== Extent of Reaction ==

In order to formalize the previous analysis of reactions in terms of a single variable, let us consider the generic reaction:

&lt;math&gt; aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD &lt;/math&gt;

The '''Molar Extent of Reaction''' X is defined as:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; X = -\frac{\Delta n_A}{a} = -\frac{\Delta n_B}{b} =  \frac{\Delta n_C}{c} = \frac{\Delta n_D}{d} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Since all of these are equivalent, it is possible to find the change in moles of any species in a given reaction if the extent of reaction X is known.

{{NOTE|Though they won't be discussed here, there are other ways in which the extent of reaction can be defined. Some other definitions are dependent on the '''percent''' change of a particular substrate, and the stoichiometry is used in a different way to determine the change in the others. This definition makes X independent of the substrate you choose.}}

The following example illustrates the use of the extent of reaction.

{{example|Consider the reaction &lt;math&gt; H_2O_2 + O_3 \rightarrow H_2O + 2O_2 &lt;/math&gt;. If you start with 50 g of &lt;math&gt; H_2O_2 &lt;/math&gt; and 25 grams of &lt;math&gt; O_3 &lt;/math&gt;, and 25% of the moles of &lt;math&gt; O_3 &lt;/math&gt; are consumed, find the molar extent of reaction and the changes in the other components.

'''Solution''': First we need to convert to moles, since stoichiometry is '''not''' valid when units are in terms of mass.

&lt;math&gt; 50 \mbox{ g H}_2O_2 * \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{34 \mbox{ g}} = 1.471 \mbox{ moles H}_2O_2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 25 \mbox{ g O}_3 * \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{48 \mbox{ g}} = 0.5208 \mbox{ moles O}_3 &lt;/math&gt; 

Clearly ozone is the limiting reactant here. Since 25% is consumed, we have that:

&lt;math&gt; \Delta n(O_3) = -0.25*0.5208 = -0.1302 \mbox{ moles O}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

Hence, by definition, &lt;math&gt; X = \frac{-0.1302}{1} = 0.1302 &lt;/math&gt;

And then we have &lt;math&gt; \Delta n(H_2O_2) = -0.1302, \Delta n(H_2O) = 0.1302, \Delta n(O_2) = 2*0.1302 = 0.2604 &lt;/math&gt;, all in moles of the appropriate substrate.}}

== Mole Balances and Extents of Reaction ==

The mole balance written above can be written in terms of extent of reaction ''if we notice that the &lt;math&gt; \Delta n(A) &lt;/math&gt; term defined above is exactly the number of moles of a generated or consumed by the reaction''. 

{{NOTE|This is only useful for ''individual species'' balances, not the overall mole balance. When doing balances on reactive systems, unlike with non-reactive systems, it is generally easier to use all individual species balances possible, rather than the total mole balance and then all but one of the individual species. This is because the total generation of moles in a reaction is generally not 0, so no algebraic advantage is gained by using the total material balance on the system.}}

Therefore we can write that:

&lt;math&gt; n_{A,gen} = \Delta n(A) = -X*a &lt;/math&gt;

where X is the molar extent of reaction and a is the stoichiometric coefficient of A. Plugging this into the mole balance derived earlier, we arrive at the '''molecular mole balance''' equation:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \dot{n}_{A,out} - \Sigma{n}_{A,in} - X*a = 0 &lt;/math&gt; if A is consumed, or +Xa if it is generated in the reaction}}

I blocked your sockpuppet ([[User:BixoDePalha]])... why on earth are you doing this again? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:39, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

BTW: your IP might be blocked, depending on which one you're trying to use for your main account. That's an autoblock of the IP used by the puppet, and will expire in 23 hours or so. If that's a serious hinderance to your editing, I'll lift the autoblock (I'll be in and out today), otherwise just use one of your other IPs. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:Lol I got a really funny phonecall about this one...
:Well, SBJohnny you are only right on one point, the user and I really share the same IP (as I have a NAT server to provide some college students access to the Net), I have spoken to BixoDePalha and examined the action and don't see a real problem, the edit was not vandalism, the change that originated the edit were not justified with a summary (nor the change itself), the users even if we generalize and say BixoDePalha was indeed working at my behalf or even myself, had no conflict with the user that did the first change. I could have done the change myself and would probably have done it.
:As a side note, I have tried to explain several times why sock puppets don't belong to the BLOCK policy, and this last block is a show how not to use the block function, puppets aren't blockable by default (open proxy are even if not on the policy), what was the reason used for the block?
:In place of wanting to delete stuff and block users a little patience and addressing things would be more productive.
:Ok, I'll now do the action myself (I will revert to before my first edit), as I and Xixtas were discussing already the problem but as it seems that if the situation is not resolved faster conflict and confusion will persist I will make a edit conflict request with Darklama so to see if we resolve things.
:I'll probably will have problems editing with my account, so see about that as you can.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 14:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

::Bad faith sockpuppets, like the kind that you employed are part of the block policy, and will stay that way, whether you like it or not. Your history of sockpuppetry has reduced your credibility in this area to zero, and we have to assume that any other accounts coming from your IP are bad-faith sockpuppets under your control. You previously used puppets to circumvent a block, and I have little doubt that you would also use sockpuppets to force your agenda on the C++ book (you have mentioned the idea before). There are two factors that go against you here:
::*You have a documented history of not working well with others.
::*You have a documented history of breaking policy to prove a point (with your sockpuppets)
::You should apologize to your friend because your bad judgement has caused that account to be blocked (and future accounts from that IP will likely be blocked as well). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:47, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:::The edit was not in bad faith, no vandalism and I can share my IP and take responsibility for it. Had I seen the change to TOC2, I would have addressed it myself. Calling bloody murder will not change the point as there is no new event to report here.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 14:58, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

::::And we are supposed to take your word for it? You may persuade other people with your story, but I am not convinced. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::I don't need to convince no one, the actions speak for themselves go see the logs. As for the &quot;existing&quot; conflict it was being [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Content#.3D.3D_TOC1.2C_TOC2.2C_Editors_TOC_.3D.3D addressed, sort of, with the help by Xixtas].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:08, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

Well Panic, if it really is a friend of yours (and not a friend of the &quot;me, myself, and I&quot; variety), I'll be happy to unblock him, so long as I have your solemn word that this is not you. My alarm bells went off because I saw a brand new editor make only one contrib, ''and'' the contrib was to a page you're apparently in a dispute over, ''and'' the Checkuser identified the IP as being used only by you and one of your &quot;parody&quot; puppets. If it's a friend of yours and he wants to contribute, that's fine, but please promise me that that's really the case. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:I have admitted to every puppets I own (btw they should be unblocked), if I had done it I would admit to it, no problem, even if your assumption was correct the edit or the sharing of the IP shouldn't validate the block, again there was no vandalism, no complain and no conflict (that is also why I defend the 3RR), for me you can have the account blocked, I don't know what he was doing but it seams there were no contributions and he told me he was just checking the changes I had made yesterday to the pages. I have told him he can request a unblock so it is up to him. (we are not on the same house)
:Again blocking users on that way even based on sock puppet for a logic is not correct, not even if it was indeed me, as WK stated early (can hunt for a quote) sock puppets may even indeed prevent conflict.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

::::The puppet account was used as part of a revert war at the [[C++ Programming]] page. I have protected that page from editing, and posted a notice about it. I don't think it's likely that a new user will, on his first edit, participate in a wheel war on the behalf of panic. Furthermore, since the account came from Panic's IP, i think there is a high probability that this is a sockpuppet account, or is at least an account from a person who is a member of Panic's agenda. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:20, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::I can live with that (even if Editor's TOC is not the best solution to readers). But an end must be given to the conflict that still originates this confusions, to the divergence between me and Darklama, the existence of several book TOCs and duplication of pages inside a single book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::The same treatment should be given to [[C++ Programming/Programming_Basics]] see talk the content is a duplication of pages and that indeed has been an active dispute with reverses by me and Darklama.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:42, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::The above page is an amalgamation of content from {[[C++ Programming/Introducing C++]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Language]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Paradigms]], [[C++ Programming/Source File]] and [[C++ Programming/Statements]], I have restored the pages yesterday from a redirect status. (95% content is identical)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:48, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

Eh, boy. Panic, I can't unblock that account right now, sorry. I've only been skimming through your conversations of late, and all I'm sure of is that you're in some sort of edit dispute again, and a mysterious user made an edit on &quot;your side&quot;, using an IP that you have used both for your main account and one of your &quot;parody accounts&quot;. If you want to provide a brief, plain-English explanation of what's going on I can give you my opinion, but that's all. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:Not again, still the same, the same that &quot;originated&quot; your first block... And no thanks I think I'll be safer without any input from you on it, you already accomplished to much today. And again if the change was on my side another was on someone else's side. right? Can you checkuser that other account as  well just clear things up.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:30, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

::Heh, one step ahead of you... I already ran checkuser on the other person: results show nothing suspicious :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:10, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:Lol (I realized this thing... so I'll put it into words). Just to show a &quot;positive side&quot; on all this. Do you know that joke about a person that enters a bar and after a while becomes uncomfortable because the patrons are having to much of a good time, every time one of them stands up and speaks a number they laugh and clap appreciatively (if you don't know the joke I will try to find it for you), well, as you probably know by now, I also do spend some time on a IRC channel (#C++) and from time to time people there also have a great laugh, every time I say &quot;I'm blocked&quot;. (so at least someone can be seen as getting something of all this, :) )...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:53, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

::Panic, I assure you that I didn't have any celebratory urges when I heard you were blocked again, and to be frank I wouldn't have blocked you this time (and really ''would'' have unblocked your puppet if I hadn't recieved strongly worded warnings about how I needed to let others make that decision). I don't object to you being blocked, because I think you're an incorrigably mischevious troll, but I don't hold that against you because I kind of admire your persistence in causing mischief. You got spunk, and I like that in a person.

::If you have a serious point to make, the best person to try to convince would be me, because you ''know'' I'm not going to believe you without a ''very'' convincing argument. I'm like New York: If you can make the argument stick with me, you can make the argument stick with anybody. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:10, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I recognize the block as valid under what I accepted to, so Xixtas is completely right there, if there was a complain it has to be addressed, I made the bed now I have to lay on it.... (how goes that story about the boy that cried wolf or is Chicken Little). I get the logic of the action not the reasoning behind it, I'm sorry I didn't take the action myself (as it was it only provided ammo to others), I could even say that by using checkuser and point BixoDePalha as sharing my IP you were acting not to prevent any abuse (as the same could have been stated about any user that changed the page, and so WK action was on the spot), but to further validate you vision of me as a &quot;incorrigably mischevious troll&quot; :), no problem there I got you also pretty good now, I can even say that you are the Wikibookian I know and understand best (I know I annoy you, Darklama, WK and WF), and I'm also sure that you get me and a &quot;incorrigably mischevious troll&quot; is only your way to reinforce that image to others, so please don't call me a troll, call me persistent or something like that, the more annoyed I become the more determined to obstruct that kind or stance and logic on Wikibooks I will be.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:38, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

::::OK, &quot;you're an incredibly persistent person who really enjoys arguing with people much more than they enjoy arguing with you, and despite knowing that they don't like arguing with you as much as you like arguing with them, you still insist that they argue with you, because you like arguing with people, and people just need to accept that&quot;. That's pretty much what I mean by &quot;troll&quot;, and you have to admit that it pretty much describes you to a tee, no?

::::Since you're into parables, let me give you a &quot;real account&quot; of my former life as a barfly, which might serve as a good parable for you (or at least for you and me). Before I was a dad (and had time to go to bars), I used to go out several nights a week and play darts or pool. I often played with the same people, and they were my friends. I didn't go out with them to do other things, but when we were playing darts or pool, we were friends. We were friends when fights happened too, and I've stood back to back with people I didn't really like all that much because they were my friends, and even though they were assholes, I was willing to shed and/or draw blood on their behalf because they were my friend, and I knew they would do the same for me (though believe it or not I was ''never'' the one to start the bar fight).

:::::In that we diverge, I have stood with friends against bad odds on a just cause or good principle but I don't give support to actions just on friendship alone and don't expect others to, friendship to me is fluid and based on shared views, ideas and principles, I'm not an emotional guy, I work on logic. I don't know if you are using the term friends to generally, but I personally don't hang out with  people I don't respect (I may have to work or do tasks with them but that is it) and I'm known to start a fight if a good enough reason is present, even if not expressly stated and I don't consider odds when action must be taken, I'm a pretty frontal person.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

If we were playing pool together in a bar and some big guy started picking on you, I might intervene on principle, but I would never assume you would take my back. I don't think you'd fight for Wikibooks either, if there was a real fight, so you're a charity case. Stop playing around and we can talk, but you've pretty much run your tab on bullshit, so if you want to get serious and talk, you better be serious from the start. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

== You Have Been Blocked ==

In accordance with your unblock agreement you have been blocked because another editor has requested it. The complaint involves the use of sockpuppets (or meatpuppets it doesn't matter) in an editing dispute. Also, there are accusations of uncivil behavior, and unwillingness to work collaboratively with other contributors. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:Can you indicate who ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

:: The complaint I acted on was brought by withinfocus on the administrators notice board. The terms for unblocking are as follows: 
::: You will be unblocked when ''(a)'' the person complaining about you requests it, ''(b)'' the blocking adnimistrator is satisfied with your explanation of whatever brought about the block, ''(c)'' at least 2 other administrators request unblocking, with no &quot;opposition votes&quot;, or ''(d)'' a majority of administrators support unblocking after 4 days of the issue being on the administrator's noticeboard. 
::I am not satisfied with your explanation. In fact, I find it to be wholly unbelievable, and am surprised that you would attempt something so bald-faced. We are not required to assume good faith when evidence points to the contrary, and lying is certainly evidence of bad faith. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:00, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

::::I said I didn't and I don't expect or need for you to believe me on that (not I or you can offer prof to contrary and it isn't even relevant), had I been active and seen the change I would do it myself and with a proper summary to the &quot;restoration&quot;, anyway I have solved the issue and did a block myself to the wikibooks IP from my LAN, as for the controlling another account, I don't see that of particular relevance to the edit performed, it was not a revert war nor a undo of any of Darklama's actions.  As I said above SB Jhonny keen eyes noticed that edit and used a particular sense of justice to point out the edit restoring the page, but he took no similar resolution on the changes favoring Darklama's, that user actions were expressly intended create a reaction (see the users last changes). Did anyone act to see if he is a puppet (or meat puppet) of someone of the involved on disputes (or active divergences) with me? I take also as &quot;strange&quot; complain Withinfocus, he wasn't involved here or a party in the active dispute, what is he complaining about?&lt;br&gt; To be fair and complete I must point out to you that Darklama was the cause behind SB Jhonny first block and I have active divergences on policy and some clearly expressed on both sides with those Wikibookians and WhiteKnight and Withinfocus, so this was more or less expected sooner or later.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::It is relevant because on that disputed page using a sockpuppet is designed to deceive other contributors. I ask you to own your actions. I did review the other editor's history. He has been a contributor here for some time, and there is no reason to suspect him of being a sock that I notice. If you had performed the revert with your own user account, we would have continued trying to hash out what should be on the main page, and you would not have been blocked. Instead, you chose a different path. So own it. I am now concerned about your ability to be honest and forthright with other contributors. You have &quot;divergences on policy&quot; with every Wikibookian that I know. Not just the four. 

:::::I have begun to see it as inevitable that you will be blocked from Wikibooks indefinitely, because you seem to be incapable of working with others on anyone's ideas other than your own. You seem to see every interaction through the lens of competition. Like each discussion is a boxing match, rather than a more productive metaphor like a band working together to create music. It might be better for everyone if we all just said this is it, the end of the road, irreconcilable differences. You can take your book and create your own fork on a different GFDL wiki somewhere. In order to work on wikibooks though, you must be willing to collaborate, assume good faith, allow others to be bold and treat others with respect. These concepts are fundamental to Wikimedia so regardless if they are formal policies or if you agree with them or not. They are critical concepts that have broad support among the community. Respectful, effective collaboration is not something that you seem to be willing or perhaps able to do. I think it would be mutually beneficial at this point for Panic and Wikibooks to split permanently as amicably as possible. 

:::::I've been thinking about my experiences as a drug counselor in a 28 day program many years ago today. You have to be accepting of failure in that job, because many of the people you try to help will not succeed. Indeed, too many end up killing themselves. It is sad. Today I am sad that no-one here could help you learn to be an effective collaborator.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I recognize the block as valid under [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=775525&amp;oldid=772884 what I accepted to], you are completely right there, if there was a complain it has to be addressed, I made the bed now I have to lay on it....&lt;br&gt;
If I desired to deceive other users would I use an account that would be traced to me? I have shown IPs have little usefulness as identification before, and blocks do not really work. And deceive ?!? deceiving whom ?!? with what intention ?!? We are talking about a single character on a page, not a reword or restatement but an edited reversion (I would have reverted it), not a personal offense or misrepresentation occurred, it was not even an actions that needed covering up, even if I was attempting to &quot;elude&quot; someone it could be seen as even an attempt to not aggravate the situation (your interpretation is not the only one), but as I said I would have done it myself without resourcing to any deception.&lt;br&gt;
SB Johnny, was not acting to protect abuse when he used checkuser to show BixoDePalha as sharing my IP and [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=801007&amp;oldid=800990 he took actions that demonstrate clearly intention to make that into an even], he could have stated more or less the same about the first change to the page (or even taken action), his notice of the fact and his rapid reaction and the noise level is even more out of place.&lt;br&gt;
I also think that [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=810130&amp;oldid=807290 SB Jhonny block] was not based on policy and again lacking the due process needed, we could say that he likes to flame users with other views and this is systematic as was shown recently on the staff lounge, there are [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARobert_Horning&amp;diff=809277&amp;oldid=808397 better ways to express objections], and I have to acknowledge that WhiteKnight was correct on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=810287&amp;oldid=810283 all his actions on this subject].&lt;br&gt;
As for the first editor, did you noticed that he also adulterated the information on the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AC%2B%2B_Programming%2FAuthors&amp;diff=810473&amp;oldid=805878 author's page] ? That it too is part a center of dispute with [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC2/Print_version Darklama that feels that is ok to remove it from the book] and has done so on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC2 toc2] and even on the [[C++ Programming/TOC2/Print version|print version]], that SB Jhonny defended that point of view, and it was one of the factors for my first block. This is more complex than you probably know.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;If you had performed the revert with your own user account, we would have continued trying to hash out what should be on the main page, and you would not have been blocked.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Again I can't prove it to you nor you the reverse, I grant you the freedom to interpret it as you will, in any case using other one's account can't be controlled or assured and is not part of policy, users shouldn't be blocked on whims, and we were [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Talk:C%2B%2B_Programming/Content#.3D.3D_TOC1.2C_TOC2.2C_Editors_TOC_.3D.3D already discussing the matter] (and more engaged into it than Darklama that was the actor behind the need to address it, it is not as he has been absent and unable to address the subject) .&lt;br&gt;
&quot;You have &quot;divergences on policy&quot; with every Wikibookian that I know.&quot;, this is not correct. I have divergences with Darklama, SB Jhonny, WhiteKnight and Winthinfocus.&lt;br&gt;
[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3APanic2k4&amp;diff=798351&amp;oldid=798270 This is more or less expressed on a reply I made to WhiteKnight].&lt;br&gt;
The single fact that Winthinfocus did make the complaint (complain that he had no part in, besides as an observer) even grants us the full house, they are all there, so who is being deceptive here...&lt;br&gt;
Do you understand [[w:Group_think|group think]] ond the formation of power grups? Don't you see the same [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMattb112885&amp;diff=788168&amp;oldid=788088 users acting also in coordination] now [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Iamunknown&amp;curid=101530&amp;diff=811275&amp;oldid=810560 against Robert], and as you know this type of coordination is not something new on those same users.&lt;br&gt;
Darklama's actions almost from the start ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADarklama&amp;diff=584432&amp;oldid=191012 2nd post on the users talk page]), have been more of the disruptive nature than on the productive (I have monitored with attention all his actions on the book), the need to create a different structure to the book, removing the copyright information from the book, moving pages, deleting content and acting on it unilaterally, and even duplicating content, for instance The [[C++ Programming/Programming Basics]] page is an amalgamation of content from {[[C++ Programming/Introducing C++]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Language]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Paradigms]], [[C++ Programming/Source File]] and [[C++ Programming/Statements]], I have restored the pages from a redirect status (95% content was identical), I have been cooperative with him as far as I could, what other books do you see having 2 sets of structures on Wikibooks?, Am I the one unable to collaborate ?!? He as gone so far to [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AVotes_for_deletion&amp;diff=773107&amp;oldid=773105 support the deletion of the work], am I to consider it an investment on providing content?&lt;br&gt;
I'm always willing to collaborate, I do assume good faith, an I allow others to be bold and do treat others with respect.
This is shown by actions and no actions shows the contrary. You are free to make your own interpretation but please act only on facts.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

I have talked to the one that did the &quot;reversal&quot; and cleared it, he was indeed acting on my behalf but not in a coordinated way (I support the intention but not the action as it indeed undermines me here), if my nick is panic you would see the reaction he had when the issues came out and phoned me, I had to drop my job for the rest of the day to attempt to clear things out.

Okay, then this should be fine. I would like you to affirm the following statements: 

'''I will''' &lt;br&gt;
* not use sockpuppets in an editing dispute or to circumvent a block. 
* assume good faith, and believe without proof that other Wikibookians are trying to help the project, not hurt it.
* collaborate with other Wikibookians even in cases where I disagree with them.
* allow others to be bold. 
* treat all Wikibookians with respect and civility.
* not attempt to deceive other Wikibookians. 
* limit my reverts to cases of outright vandalism and will try to fix any errors I find through iterative changes. 
* try in good faith to work on a community version of the modules I am editing and not create new modules to circumvent the need for collaboration.
* agree to these things of my free will irregardless of whether previous actions done to me were justified or unjustified.

For my part, as a show of good faith, I personally will affirm all of these things myself on my talk page. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:14, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

:Lets wait a week let the block active, you should also address Whitinfocus opposition, continue to monitor the pages and I don't need you to re/affirm all (You can reduce some of the listed issues as I have affirmed as much and have not broken them, and other are ripe to be included on general policy), I never doubted your good faith even if we had some little misunderstanding ourselves but not a real divergence on the fundamental things. One of the points that must be addressed are the pending core unilateral actions of Darklama that I expressed above and find a solution to the 2 book contest that can be worked out, I gave all my input on that topic by now, an engagement with other editors would be great, and special considerations should be given to the final users, the readers.&lt;br&gt;
:I especially ask that if time allows you to address what is happening with Robert at the moment.&lt;br&gt;
:Not to end in a bad note but I will circumvent a block if excluded from the final discussion and if no consensual agreement is found to justify it that includes me. (this is a show of god faith and an express attempt to be clear that even if I have no intend in deceiving anyone I will have no other resource if forced into it, this is not a threat, it is only a state of fact, no subliminal text is intended, I stating the contrary would indeed be a lie, sorry if I'm to frontal but that is the way I'm and I don't hide it)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:56, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

:::I have read your last post to the staff lounge and I don't agree with you on the level of difficulty (it is certainly not equal to all), I came here before I used Wikipedia or other Wikimedia project but most users do the reverse take for instance this [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Robert_Horning&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=384663 post, one of the first made on the project by SB Jhonny].
:::The user was watching in particular my edits and aware of what has been happening as I said above, so generally speaking I don't think it is as strange as that since there is a causal relation. He was at least more or less at the same level of the other user that also seems well informed, he selected 2 of the pages that would call especially my attention, SB Jhonny also was watching and I know you were, so if every body is watching what is strange about it? Was the edit that [[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=810125&amp;oldid=805424 complex]] ? He made a simple edit reversion any 8 year old could do if pointed to do it. A more experienced user would just do a revert (less typing), but again you are free not to believe me as I engaged on not so dissimilar actions on the past (but consider the context and the edits made and you will see a reasonable difference, never did I use another account to deceive as SB Jhonny was well aware, and the reasons were completely different), as SB Jhonny so loudly has stated on the post &quot;Why??????&quot; would I do it.
:::Another point that we must all understand is that preemptive actions don't work and are particularly prone to generate more problems and to be used as tools to other purposes (in real life and on Wikibooks), all users are free to comment but until a request or statement of unsolvable divergence users should be able and free to resolve issues themselves, this is a rule of thumb that I think no one can contest.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:45, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Panic, asking someone to make an edit on your behalf isn't any better than sockpuppetry (it might even be worse). The edit was &quot;complex&quot; in the sense that for a brand-new user to even know about the multiple TOCs and such, and then have their only edit be switching the redirect.
::::In any case, why don't you guys just provide links to the various TOCs on the main page, rather than having it a redirect? --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:32, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::I asked him how did he come to notice the change and he said he was reading the book and during a page switch the table of content was missing, And agree that coordination would be sock puppetry but again I didn't ask for the action, for example when you made the post on my talk asking that I apologized to WK were you a meat puppet? The concept is the same. He had no business in doing it but he used his personal judgment to act on it, if we think on who should have done the action it would have to be me or Darklama even the other user was wrong to make the change, why didn't you also reverted that one, why did you reinforce toc2, were you also acting in someones behalf? what was your logic there ? What reason besides you &quot;interpretation&quot; had you to block the user or intervene at all?
:::::But anyway I don't think that this is all that relevant as an issue, the concept of sock puppets as a problem is wrong from the start, all users are more or less anonymous and if the concept of consensus was really used, numbers wouldn't have importance, this can even have other implications, for instance in the US some states don't let minors author works, a parent could share his account and get the attribution, another case would be an organization could use it's login to pay several workers to contribute in it's behalf and also get the right attributions.
:::::The bottom line is that I or anyone can't be sure that any user is who he states to be in any all cases, we have to rely on the statements we make and have good faith.
:::::The problem with multiple tocs is addressed on the conversation I was having with Xixtas, by removing the TOC from the 1st page of the book by adding a cover or a menu, all other pages would have to be moved to another &quot;directory&quot; so to preserve the navigation, and a bifurcation or even more TOCs is not doable in the way that there will have to be a TOC used as the main root, so users can backtrack and select other pages.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:45, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

::::::Leaving aside the issue of whether the specific edit was you or a sock puppet or a meat puppet... There is a new problem with lifting the block. Your threat to use sock puppets to get around a block by the community has hardened the positions of those who say you should be blocked indefinitely. This is unfortunate in my view, but this subject must now be dealt with. The offer to specifically affirm the list is still open.

From: [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SockPuppet Meatball Wiki Sockpuppet]&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A sock puppet is an additional OnlineIdentity used by someone who already has another OnlineIdentity for participating in a given community, particularly when done in a non-transparent manner and where the identities interact with each other in some way.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
This leads to the creation of puppet shows no one has engaged on such action that I know of at least explicitly as this is used to get a supporting voice in a discussion or create a fake discussion in a way to drag others into it. I agree that a block due to this type of action is justified, but addressing the problem that lead to it would result in a more definitive solution.&lt;br&gt;
From: [[w:WP:SOCK]]&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A sock puppet is an additional username used by a Wikipedian who edits under more than one name. The Wikipedian who uses a sock puppet '''may be called''' a sock puppeteer. Use of sock puppets is discouraged '''in most cases'''.
The reason for '''discouraging''' sock puppets is to prevent abuses such as a person voting more than once in a poll, or using multiple accounts to circumvent Wikipedia policies or cause disruption. Some people feel that second accounts should not be used at all; '''others feel it is harmless if the accounts are behaving acceptably'''.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
This is a Wikipedia policy has no direct translation to this project, even more because of the goals and particular  needs of it.  I have in the past seen people defend this policy as problematic (I can hunt the statements), in any case no abuse of the nature described was performed. I have highlighted the parts that address my view and show that even on that policy the text is not prohibitive. But I agree and I think that I have edited the block policy to address it, a block in this situation is also valid if prof of wrong doing is found but I don't see his types of abuses occurring without reason to, as I stated early if consensus is fallowed there is no incentive for anyone to behave like that.&lt;br&gt;
I think you are referring to the block situation, but speaking theoretically, in that case the only restriction would be that any new account couldn't be publicly recognized by belonging to the blocked user as it would  be blocked, this doesn't mean that a blocked user can't create and use them and that the community can enforce a block without collaboration from the blocked user, a user may even consider a moral imperative to do so or as Xania stated be lead to a situation that all moral barriers and respect for others would go out of the door and lead to real grave problems in that case, only if direct and highly noticed disruption occurred Wikimedia would have to recurse to legal action, and even then it could be hard to deal with it.&lt;br&gt;
On the factual side of the discussion, I didn't make a threat, I stated a fact and I have stated it many times in the past and this is public knowledge to be true, an account can be blocked even a IP or a range of IPs but that doesn't mean the human will be blocked as there is no way it can be enforced, what you took for a threat was that after you requested to state that I wouldn't recur to such action in the future, I simply refused to state it as it could become a lie, I could have easily said I would as it would be impossible to verify if I would or not. As I also said previously a block to a non vandal (or automated disruption attempt) can only be enforced by consensual agreement.&lt;br&gt;
In a perfect world this problem wouldn't exist as a block would be final, but in a perfect world no need for blocks would exist.&lt;br&gt;
In any case there is a flaw on the logic you are applying to the actual problem, the request for statements or declarations are in themselves a lack of good faith, I have stated so before regarding the other imposed statements, even the wish to provide a protection or an attempt to address future problems is wrong as the proper place to do that is on general policy and not on the specific user, since even time isn't a factor and no action is being yet addressed, or the block would be justified.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:07, 1 April 2007 (UTC)

:Again, you come out swinging. It is distasteful to me to think that someone that would consider it a &quot;moral imperative&quot; to damage the hard work of others because of their own anger at being excluded from participation. In fact, it makes me sick to think of it. I would not act that way myself if I were faced with the choice, and I honestly don't understand those who would. 
:Instead of &quot;threat&quot; I could have used the word &quot;intent&quot; or even &quot;promise&quot;. It was a declaration of intent to act in a way that would be counter to declared interest of the community in a given circumstance. I reject the notion that a human being cannot be blocked. Just because our tools cannot block individuals with 100% effectiveness does not mean that the project cannot block them. This is a limitation of the tools and nothing more. The block that is in effect now is on your person, not your account or your IP address. 
:I confess that I lack faith in your ability to follow the spirit of the rules, use good judgment and interact positively with other Wikibookians. This is not because I did not assume good faith from the outset, it is because of your own actions and words.
:Have you identified another project that would be a suitable host for a fork of the C++ Programming book where you could work on it without having to interact with the Wikibooks community? This is probably the best chance for a long term resolution to this situation. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:55, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

:Hi Lczernia. The images you purchased can't be uploaded on Wikibooks unless they were released under a free license or are public domain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basics of Rootfinding ==

Rootfinding is the determination of solutions to single-variable equations or to systems of n equations in n unknowns (provided that such solutions exist). The basics of the method revolve around the determination of ''roots''

A '''root''' of a function &lt;math&gt; F(x_1,x_2,...) &lt;/math&gt; in any number of variables is defined as the solution to the equation &lt;math&gt; F(x_1,x_2,...) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. '''In order to use any of the numerical methods in this section, the equation should be put in a specific form''', and this is one of the more common ones, used for all methods except the iterative method. 

However, it is easy to put a function into this form. If you start with an equation of the form:

&lt;math&gt; F_1(x_1,x_2,...) = F_2(x_1,x_2,...) &lt;/math&gt;

then subtracting &lt;math&gt; F_2 &lt;/math&gt; will yield the required form. ''Do not forget to do this, even if there is only a constant on one side!''

{{example|If you want to use the bisection method later in this section to find one of the solutions of the equation &lt;math&gt; 1 = x^2 &lt;/math&gt;, you should rewrite the equation as &lt;math&gt; 0 = x^2 - 1 &lt;/math&gt; so as to put it in the correct form. }}

Since any equation can be put into this form, the methods can potentially be applied to any function, though they work better for some functions than others.

== Analytical vs. Numerical Solutions ==

An '''analytical''' solution to an equation or system is a solution which can be arrived at exactly using some mathematical tools. For example, consider the function &lt;math&gt; y = ln(x) &lt;/math&gt;, graphed below.

[[Image:Ln_.svg]]

The root of this function is, by convention, when &lt;math&gt; y = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, or when this function crosses the x-axis. Hence, the root will occur when &lt;math&gt; ln(x) = 0 \rightarrow x = e^0 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The answer '''x=1''' is an analytical solution because through the use of algebra, we were able to come up with an exact answer. 

On the other hand, attempting to solve an equation like:

&lt;math&gt; -x = ln(x) &lt;/math&gt;

analytically is sure to lead to frustration because it is not possible with elementary methods. In such a case it is necessary to seek a '''numerical''' solution, in which guesses are made until the answer is &quot;close enough&quot;, but you'll never know what the ''exact'' answer is. 

All that the numerical methods discussed below do is give you a systematic method of guessing solutions so that you'll be likely (and in some cases guaranteed) to get closer and closer to the true answer. The problem with numerical methods is that most are not guaranteed to work without a good enough ''initial guess''. Therefore it is valuable to try a few points until you get somewhere close and ''then'' start with the numerical algorithm to get a more accurate answer. They are roughly in order from the easiest to use to the more difficult but faster-converging algorithms.

== Rootfinding Algorithms ==

=== Iterative solution ===

Iterative solutions in their purest form will solve the desired function so that it is in the form:

&lt;math&gt; x = f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

Then, a value for x is guessed, and f(x) is calculated. The new value of x is then re-inserted into f(x), and the process is repeated until the value of x changes very little.

The following example illustrates this procedure.

{{example|Use an iterative solution to calculate the root of &lt;math&gt; x + ln(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution''': Solve the equation for x:

&lt;math&gt; e^{-x} = x &lt;/math&gt;

First we need to guess an x to get it started. Let's try &lt;math&gt; x = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt;

Then we have:

&lt;math&gt; x = e^{-0.5} = 0.6065 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_2 = e^{-0.6065} = 0.5453 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_3 = e^{-0.5453} = 0.5796 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_4 = e^{-0.5796} = 0.5601 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_5 = e^{-0.5601} = 0.5711 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_6 = e^{-0.5711} = 0.5649 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_7 = e^{-0.5649} = 0.5684 &lt;/math&gt;

Thus to two decimal places the root is &lt;math&gt; x = 0.56 &lt;/math&gt;. More iterations could be performed to get a more accurate answer if desired.
}}

This method has some rather severe limitations as we'll see in this example:

{{example|Repeat the above but this time solve for x a different way. What do you find?

'''Solution: To illustrate the point, let's start with a guess of &lt;math&gt; x = 0.56 &lt;/math&gt;

The other way to solve for x is the more obvious way: &lt;math&gt; x = -ln(x) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x = -ln(0.56) = 0.5798 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_2 = -ln(0.5798) = 0.5451 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_3 = -ln(0.5451) = 0.6068 &lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, even though we started with a very good guess, the solution is diverging!  }}

This example shows that '''the success of the iteration method strongly depends on the properties of the function on the right-hand side'''. In particular, it has to do with how large the slope of the function is at the root. If the slope is too large, the method will not converge, and even if it is small the method converges slowly. Therefore it is generally undesirable to use this method, though some more useful algorithms are based on it (which is why it is presented here).

=== Iterative Solution with Weights ===

Although the iterative solution method has its downfalls, it can be drastically improved through the use of '''averaging'''. In this method, the function is still solved for x in the form:

&lt;math&gt; x = f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

From the initial guess &lt;math&gt; x_0 &lt;/math&gt;, the function f(x) is used to generate the second guess &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt;. However, rather than simply putting &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt; into f(x), a ''weighted average'' of &lt;math&gt; x_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt; is made:

&lt;math&gt; x_1(New)= \alpha*x_0 + (1-\alpha)*x_1(old) , 0 \le \alpha \le 1 &lt;/math&gt;

The term &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is called the '''weight'''. The most common value of the weight is one-half, in which case the next value to plug into f(x) is simply the average of &lt;math&gt; x_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x_1(old) &lt;/math&gt;:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; x_1(New) = \frac{x_0 + x_1(Old)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;}}

This new value is then plugged into f(x), averaged with the result, and this is repeated until convergence.

The following examples show that this method converges faster and with more reliability than normal iterative solution.

{{example|Find the root of &lt;math&gt; x + ln(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; using the iterative method with a weight of &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution''': Let's start with a guess of 0.5 like last time, and compare what happens this time from what happened with normal iteration.

&lt;math&gt; x_1 = e^{-0.5} = 0.6065 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_1(new) = \frac{0.5+0.6065}{2} = 0.5533 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_2 = e^{-0.5533} = 0.5751 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_2(new) = \frac{0.5533+0.5751}{2} = 0.5642 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_3 = e^{-0.5642} = 0.5688 &lt;/math&gt;

Here, after only three evaluations of the function (which usually takes the longest time of all the steps), we have the root to the same accuracy as '''seven''' evaluations with the other method!}}

The method is not only faster-converging but also more stable, so that it can actually be used solving the equation the other way too.

{{example|Starting with an initial guess of &lt;math&gt; x = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt; and using &lt;math&gt; x = -ln(x) &lt;/math&gt; and the weighted iteration method with &lt;math&gt; \alpha = \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;, find the root of the equation.

'''Solution''': Starting with &lt;math&gt; x_0 = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt; we have:

&lt;math&gt; x_1 = -ln(0.5) = 0.693 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_1(new) = \frac{0.693+0.5}{2} = 0.597 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_2 = -ln(0.597) = 0.517 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_2(new) = \frac{0.517+0.597}{2} = 0.557 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_3 = -ln(0.557) = 0.5856 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_3(new) = \frac{0.5856+0.557}{2} = 0.571 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_4 = -ln(0.571) = 0.560 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_4(new) = \frac{0.560 + 0.571}{2} = 0.565 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x_5 = -ln(0.565) = 0.570 &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore we can (slowly) converge in this case using the weighted iteration method to the solution. }}

Notice that in this case, if we use regular iteration the result only converged if the equation was solved in a certain way. Using weighted iteration, it is possible to solve it either way and obtain a solution, but one way is clearly faster than the other. However, weighting will accelerate the algorithm in most cases and is relatively easy to implement, so it is a worthwhile method to use.

=== Bisection Method ===

Let us consider an alternative approach to rootfinding. Consider a function f(x) = 0 which we desire to find the roots of. If we let a second variable &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt;, then y will (almost always) change sign between the left-hand side of the root and the right-hand side. This can be seen in the above picture of &lt;math&gt; y = ln(x) &lt;/math&gt;, which changes from negative to the left of the root &lt;math&gt; x = 1 &lt;/math&gt; to positive to its right.

The bisection method works by taking the observation that a function changes sign between two points, and narrowing the interval in which the sign change occurs until the root contained within is tightly enclosed. This only works for a [[w:continuous|continuous]] function, in which there are no jumps or holes in the graph, but a large number of commonly-used functions are like this including logarithms (for positive numbers), sine and cosine, and polynomials.

As a more formalized explaination, consider a function &lt;math&gt; y = f(x) &lt;/math&gt; that changes sign between &lt;math&gt; x = a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x = b &lt;/math&gt; We can narrow the interval by:

# Evaluating the function at the midpoint
# Determining whether the function changes signs or not in each sub-interval
# If the continuous function changes sign in a sub-interval, that means it contains a root, so we keep the interval. 
# If the function does not change sign, we discard it. This can potentially cause problems if there are two roots in the interval,so the bisection method is not guaranteed to find ALL of the roots. 

Though the bisection method is not guaranteed to find ''all'' roots, it '''is''' guaranteed to find at least one if the original endpoints had opposite signs.

The process above is repeated until you're as close as you like to the root.

{{example|Find the root of &lt;math&gt; y = x+ln(x) &lt;/math&gt; using the bisection method

By plugging in some numbers, we can find that the function changes sign between &lt;math&gt; x = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(y = -0.193)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x = 1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(y = 1) &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, since the function is continuous, there must be at least one root in this interval.

* First Interval: &lt;math&gt; 0.5(-) &lt; x &lt; 1(+) &lt;/math&gt;
* Midpoint: &lt;math&gt; x = 0.75 &lt;/math&gt;
* y at midpoint: &lt;math&gt; y = 0.75 + ln(0.75) = 0.462 &lt;/math&gt; Therefore, the sign changes between 0.5 and 0.75 and does not between 0.75 and 1.

* New Interval: &lt;math&gt; 0.5(-) &lt; x &lt; 0.75(+) &lt;/math&gt;
* Midpoint: &lt;math&gt; x = 0.625 &lt;/math&gt;
* y at midpoint: &lt;math&gt; y = 0.155 &lt;/math&gt;

* New Interval: &lt;math&gt; 0.5(-) &lt; x &lt; 0.625(+) &lt;/math&gt;
* Midpoint: &lt;math&gt; x = 0.5625 &lt;/math&gt;
* y at midpoint: &lt;math&gt; y = -0.0129 &lt;/math&gt;

We could keep doing this, but since this result is very close to the root, lets see if there's a number smaller than 0.625 which gives a positive function value and save ourselves some time.

* x Value: &lt;math&gt; x = 0.57 &lt;/math&gt;
* y value: &lt;math&gt; y = 0.00788 &lt;/math&gt;

Hence x lies between 0.5625 and 0.57 (since the function changes sign on this interval). }}

Note that convergence is slow but steady with this method. It is useful for refining crude approximations to something close enough to use a faster but non-guaranteed method such as weighted iteration.

=== Regula Falsi ===

The Regula Falsi method is similar the bisection method. You must again start with two x values between which the function f(x) you want to find the root of changes. However, this method attempts to find a better place than the midpoint of the interval to split it.It is based on the hypothesis that instead of arbitrarily using the midpoint of the interval as a guide, we should do one extra calculation to try and take into account the ''shape'' of the curve. This is done by finding the secant line ''between two endpoints'' and using the root of that line as the splitting point.

More formally:

* Draw or calculate the equation for the line between the two endpoints (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)). 
* Find where this line intersects the x-axis (or when y = 0), giving you x = c
* Use this x value to evaluate the function, giving you f(c)
* The sub-intervals are then treated as in the bisection method. If the sign changes between f(a) and f(c), keep the inteval; otherwise, throw it away. Do the same between f(c) and f(b).
* Repeat until you're at a desired accuracy.

Use these two formulas to solve for the secant line y = mx + B:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; B = f(b)-m*b = f(a) - m*a &lt;/math&gt; (you can use either)}}

The regula falsi method is guaranteed to converge to a root, but it may or may not be faster than the bisection method, depending on how long it takes to calculate the slope of the line and the shape of the function.

{{example|Find the root of &lt;math&gt; x + ln(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; but this time use the regula falsi method.

'''Solution''': Be careful with your bookkeeping with this one! It's more important to keep track of y values than it was with bisection, where all we cared about was the sign of the function, not it's actual value.

For comparison with bisection, let's choose the same initial guesses: &lt;math&gt; a = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, for which &lt;math&gt; f(a) = -0.693 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f(b) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

* First interval: &lt;math&gt; 0.5 &lt; x &lt; 1, -0.193(-) &lt; f(x) &lt; 1(+) &lt;/math&gt;
* Secant line: &lt;math&gt; y = 2.386x - 1.386 &lt;/math&gt;
* Root of secant line: &lt;math&gt; x = 0.581 &lt;/math&gt;
* Function value at root: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 0.581 + ln(0.581) = 0.038(+) &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that in this case, we can discard a MUCH larger interval than with the bisection method (which would use &lt;math&gt; x = 0.75 &lt;/math&gt; as the splitting point)

* Second interval: &lt;math&gt; 0.5 &lt; x &lt; 0.581, -0.193(-) &lt; f(x) &lt; 0.038(+) &lt;/math&gt;
* Secant line: &lt;math&gt; y = 2.852x - 1.619 &lt;/math&gt;
* Root of secant line: &lt;math&gt; x = 0.5676 &lt;/math&gt;
* Function value at root: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = 0.0013 &lt;/math&gt;

We come up with practically the exact root after only two iterations! }}

In some cases, the regula falsi method will take longer than the bisection method, depending on the shape of the curve. However, it generally worth trying for a couple of iterations due to the drastic speed increases possible.

=== Tangent Method (Newton's Method) ===

In this method, we attempt to find the root of a function y = f(x) using the ''tangent'' lines to functions. This is similar to the secant method, except it &quot;cuts loose&quot; from the old point and only concentrates on the new one, thus hoping to avoid hang-ups such as the one experienced in the example. 

Since this class assumes students have not taken calculus, the tangent will be approximated by finding the equation of a line between two very close points, which are denoted (x) and &lt;math&gt; (x+\delta x) &lt;/math&gt;. The method works as follows:

# Choose '''one''' initial guess, &lt;math&gt; x_1 &lt;/math&gt;
# Evaluate the function f(x) at &lt;math&gt; x = x_1 &lt;/math&gt; and at &lt;math&gt; x = x_1 + \delta x &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \delta x &lt;/math&gt; is a small number. These yield two points on your (approximate) tangent line.
# Find the equation for the tangent line using the formulas given above.
# Find the root of this line. This is &lt;math&gt; x_2 &lt;/math&gt;
# Repeat steps 2-4 until you're as close as you like to the root.

This method is '''not guaranteed to converge''' unless you start off with a good enough first guess, which is why the guaranteed methods are useful for generating one. However, since this method, when it converges, is much faster than any of the others, it is preferable to use if a suitable guess is available.

{{example|Find the root of &lt;math&gt; x + ln(x) = y &lt;/math&gt; using the tangent method.

'''Solution''': Let's guess &lt;math&gt; x_1 = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt; for comparison with iteration. Choose &lt;math&gt; \delta(x) = 0.001 &lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; f(x_1) = f(0.5) = -0.193 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; f(x_1 + \delta x) = f(0.501) = -0.190 &lt;/math&gt;
* Tangent line: &lt;math&gt; y = 2.85x - 1.618 &lt;/math&gt;
* Root of tangent line: &lt;math&gt; x = 0.5677 &lt;/math&gt;

Already we're as accurate as any other method we've used so far after only '''one''' calculation!}}

This book will be a non-technical look at the field of electrical engineering, including education, careers, trends, economics, etc. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:24, 30 March 2007 (UTC)

== Introduction ==
It may come as a surprise to some readers that no company in this day and age will hire a person to analyze a circuit. In fact, few companies will hire people to design circuits composed of resistors, capacitors, and inductors, because all these tasks are handled automatically by Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools. Also, even though electrical engineering students do spend a large amount of time doing math, solving integrals, and manipulating equations, nobody in the entire industry gets paid to solve math problems. Again, computer tools are used to solve these math problems quickly and cheaply. In fact, for less then $1000, a company can buy a set of software tools that can solve all the basic problems that most undergraduate Electrical Engineering students can solve, and in a fraction of the time. 

This is all the more shock to people whose only experiance with the whole phenomina of electricity is the wires in the home, and the few circuit tutorials (and wikibooks!) found online. After all, what else is there to the field then the wires we see, and the funny circuit diagrams online? Electrical engineering students, and graduated engineers are asked very frequently for help in wiring houses, to which the most common response is &quot;I don't know anything about wiring houses&quot;. How can a person go to college for 4 years or more studying electricity almost exclusively, and not know a thing about the wires that bring electricity to your house? An electrical engineer, unless he has had some special training cannot fix your car, your toaster, or your alarm clock. An electrical engineer will frequently (although not always) be unable to fix your computer.

So what then, if anything, does an electrical engineer do? 

The field of Electrical Engineering focuses on 2 aspects: Analysis, and Synthesis. Certainly a computer program can solve nearly any problem, but somebody must be there to feed the problem information into the computer. Not only that, but somebody must be on the other end to interpret the results. Engineering in general is all about trade-offs. Gaining an advantage in one aspect means losing an advantage in another aspect. Gaining a faster data rate, for instance, comes at the cost of a wider bandwidth (and more expensive cables and receivers and transmitters). Transmitting data reliably requires a large amount of power, which can be costly and can produce heat. Where is the line drawn? Where does the computer say that one negative aspect is acceptable in the face of a positive aspect? 

Once a physical system has been analyzed, that information must be modeled mathematically, and converted into a format that a CAD tool can use. Once the CAD tool is done grinding away at the math, the human reader then needs to verify the output (because computers can do some whacky things), and then convert that information back into a form for humans to read, understand, and ultimately implement. 

If an engineer needs a wire, a transistor, a diode, or a switch, he can walk down to a circuit supply shop, and buy it. Few people, if any, are working to improve these basic parts. No sense reinventing the wheel, after all. Electrical engineers are always attempting to take the things they know, and create new and better things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Differential in Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) is a technique to monitor the differences in proteomic profile between cells in different functional states. This is done by fluorescent tagging of two samples with two different dyes, then they are run the same 2D- PAGE, after the run superimpose the two flourescent images of the same gel to study proteins common in both samples and also proteins that are expressed differentially. This technology allows for simultaneous separation and comparison of up to three samples on one gel.

==DIGE vs 2D- PAGE==

In the traditional 2D-PAGE to compare differential expression of proteins, different samples are often separated in multiple gels and then overlapped in order to compare different spots or intensity of spot changes from one gel to another. Due to differences between gels in spatial resolution and spot intensities the overlaying of images and correct matching of proteins difficult. These are also gel-to-gel variations in protein uptake by the isoelectric focusing strips, incomplete protein transfer from the first to the second dimension gel and local in homogeneities in gel composition, field strength or pH gradients. These gel-to-gel variation are the experimental variations and that masks the biological variation between the samples. Thus quantitative comparisons of protein expression levels are difficult using 2D - PAGE. 

In DIGE protein mixtures are pre-labelled with cyanine dyes that guarantee co- migration of proteins, prior to electrophoresis. This co-migration on the same gel eliminate running differences these samples. In addition, the samples are subjected to same enviornment and procedures throughout the experiment,so it minimizes the experimental variation in spot quantities. In DIGE, there is no need for post-processing of gel for visualization.

==Dyes==

The cyanine dyes (Cy2, Cy3 and Cy5) used for DIGE are N-hydroxy succinimidyl ester derivatives,are covalently tagged to the amino group of lysine residue of proteins and replaces the -amino group positive charge with the positive charge of the dye. The binding of the dyes introduce small but matched increase in molecular weight. Since these dyes are hydrophobic, to prevent precipitation of proteins only one lysine residue per protein is labelled (minimal labelling). Minimal labeling limits the fluorescence intensity and thus the sensitivity of the stain. The dyes are all charge-matched and molecular mass-matched to prevent alterations of pI, and minimise dye-induced shifting of labelled proteins during electrophoresis. 

Another approach is to use cyanine dyes other than the previously described dyes, which saturate cysteine residues instead of minimally labelling lysine residues. Again these cyanine dyes used are mass and charged matched; but there is a smaller chance of protein modification and pI shift. Saturation cysteine dyes have  superior sensitivity than minimal lysine labeling. As with the minimal lysine labelling cyanine dyes, if a cysteine amino acid is not present in a protein then the saturation dyes will not be able to label it, leaving the protein undectatable.

==Experiment== 

*'''Using 2 dyes'''
Two protein samples are first labeled with propyl-Cy3 and methyl-Cy5. The labelled samples are then mixed and applied onto a single 2D-GE gel and after the run the corresponding protein spot patterns are visualized by successively illuminating the gel with the excitation wavelengths of each of the dyes.To view images click here[[http://dir.niehs.nih.gov/proteomics/emerging.htm]][[http://www.proteome.org.au/Difference-Gel-Electrophoresis/default.aspx]] The resulting protein spots are analyzed using software. Differentially expressed protein spots are then excised from the gel and identified by mass spectrometry.
*'''Using 3dyes'''
Only a direct comparison of two different protein samples can be performed using two dyes. To study multiple samples, a large number of pair wise comparisons or analysis of samples run on different gels is needed. An important alternative is to use a third dye (Cy2) with similar characteristics as Cy3 and Cy5.Protein samples are labelled with either Cy3 or Cy5 and a pooled sample containing equal amounts of all samples in the experiment is labelled with Cy2. All samples are then applied on the same gel.The pooled sample acts as an internal standard for every protein spot on each of the gels and is then used for normalization of all spots, across all gels. This approach reduces the experimental variation and increases the accuracy of quantification and the statistical confidence of protein expression differences.

==Advantages==
To study differential expression of proteins, no need to run mutliple gels.Loss of proteins even in the low molecular weight range is reduced since no post-electrophoretic processing (fixation or destaining) is necessary.This method is more quantitative than the standard colorimetric staining methods, both with regard to sensitivity as well as linearity.Also differences in spot fluorescence intensity are purely attributable to biological and not experimental variation with increased confidence.

This is a photograph of a [[foiled twisted pair]] cable dissected.  From the outside (on the right of the photo) to the inside are the different layers of the cable.  The layers are as follows:

* plastic outer sheath, 
* ground, or drain wire (always in contact with the shielding), usually terminated to ground on one end only.
* foil shielding
* the plastic inner plastic cover
* the four pairs of two wires
** insulation on each wire
** the single core conductor

==1. Learn the manual alphabet used by the deaf. ==
The '''American Manual Alphabet''' is a manual alphabet that augments the vocabulary of [[w:American Sign Language|American Sign Language]] when spelling individual letters of a word is the preferred or only option, such as with proper names or the titles of works.  Letters should be signed with the dominant hand and in most cases, with palm facing the viewer. 

To practice fingerspelling receptive skills try Dr. Bill Vicars website http://asl.ms/ or ASLpro's Quizme fingerspelling http://www.aslpro.com/cgi-bin/aslpro/fingerspell.cgi



===Chart===
[[Image:Asl_alphabet_gallaudet_ann.svg|600 px]]

The ASL alphabet is based on an old Spanish manual alphabet that dates back to at least the seventeenth century.

It is used with minor modification in Paraguay, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. The Asian countries just listed modify the T, for the ASL T is considered obscene. Instead, they use the T of the [[w:Irish manual alphabet|Irish manual alphabet]], which is like an ASL X, but with the thumb tucked into the index finger (that is, the index finger wraps around the tip of the thumb). In Thailand, one indicates points on the left hand for the tone and vowel marks of the Thai alphabet, and aspiration is not indicated. The Paraguay alphabet is identical to ASL, except for the addition of the letter Ñ, which is an N swiveled at the wrist so that the fingers move side to side, and the letters LL and RR, which are L and R plus movement to the side. 

It is also used in Germany, Austria, Norway, and Finland, again with a modification for the letter T. T is like G with the thumb placed atop the first knuckle of the index finger.

German Ä, Ö, Ü, and ß are signed like A, O, U, and S but with a downward motion, while SCH is a 5 hand (palm forward). In Norwegian and Finnish, the letters Ä, Å, Ö, Ø are derived by moving A and O (in the case of Å, in a small window-washing circular motion), and it is the Æ that gets the 5 hand (perhaps somewhat flexed).

=== Good form ===
* The hand should either remain in place while fingerspelling, or more often, drift slightly away from the midline in the manner of text being written out in the air; although, this is a subtle movement and should not be exaggerated. 
* If fingerspelling multiple words or entire sentences, there should be a very brief pause between terms so as to signify the beginning and ending of individual words. 
* Long nails or excessive jewelry can be distracting when watching fingerspelling and for this reason people who regularly use sign language usually avoid them.
* When fingerspelling acronyms in American Sign Language, such as with FBI, NASA, or RID (Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf), the letters are often moved in a small circle to emphasize that they should not be read together as a word.
* Additionally, when fingerspelling the hand '''should not bounce''' between letters. An exception is the case of double letters as with the word ''carry'' in which the double ''R'' can be shown by slightly bouncing the corresponding handshape, or by dragging it, slightly, to the side. Either method is a correct way to show double letters. However, people who bounce between '''every''' letter produce fingerspelling that is very hard to watch or understand. Those who cannot overcome the habit of bouncing every letter may find it helpful to hold the wrist of the hand doing the fingerspelling with the free hand so that they are forced to keep the hand from moving up and down while fingerspelling. Usually, only a few hours or days of this is enough to break the habit of unnecessary bouncing while fingerspelling.

===Common mistakes===
Many mistakes made by beginning fingerspellers are directly attributable to how the manual alphabet is most often shown in graphics.

=====Letters=====
In most drawings or illustrations of the American Manual Alphabet, some of the letters are depicted from the side to better illustrate the desired handshape; however in practice, the hand should '''not''' be turned to the side when producing the letter. The letters ''C'' and ''O'' are two that are often mistakenly turned to the side by beginners who become used to seeing them from the side in illustrations. Important exceptions to the rule that the palm should always be facing the viewer are the letters ''G'' and ''H''. These two letters should be made, not with the palm facing the viewer or the speaker, but with the palm facing sideways - the hand in an '''ergonomically neutral position'''.

=====Numbers=====
Another mistake made by people faithfully following the pictures in most illustrations of the ASL fingerspelling alphabet is the signing of the cardinal numbers ''1 - 5'' with the palm facing out. The cardinal numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 should be signed palm in (towards the signer). This is in contrast with the cardinal numbers 6-9 which should be produced with the palm turned to face the person being addressed. 

As with the letter ''O'', the zero should not be turned to the side, but shown palm facing forward. 

This applies only to the cardinal numbers however. Using numbers in other situations, such as with for showing the digits of the time for example, has different rules. When signing the time, the numbers are always facing the person being addressed, even the numbers one through five. Other signing situations involving numbers have their own norms that must be learned on a case by case basis.

=====Rhythm, speed &amp; movement=====
When fingerspelling, your hand should be at shoulder height, and should not 'bounce' with each letter. Your hand should stay in one place and only the handshape changes (and orientation for some letters). If you have trouble doing this, you might want to hold your forearm with your nondominant hand in order to force your spelling hand to stay still. 'Bouncing' the letters makes your fingerspelling difficult to read, even for native signers.

As well, clear handshapes are much easier to read than fast fingerspelling. Do not concentrate on speed, as fast fingerspelling with poorly formed handshapes will be difficult to read. Try to fingerspell the whole word at the same speed, not speeding up or slowing down. A pause indicates the beginning of a new word, so if you suddenly slow down because a letter combination is difficult, your reader may think you are starting a new word, leading to misunderstanding. An exception to this sometimes appears at the beginning of a word. The first letter may be held for the length of a letter extra as a cue that the signer is about to start fingerspelling.

==2. Have a minimum of three hours of instruction in signing. ==
Where do you find a sign language instructor?  First, if you know a deaf person or someone who knows how to sign, ask them for a referral.  If that doesn't work out, check with a local high school guidance counselor.  They may be able to direct you to either a free or for-pay program.  You can also check into a local social services organization, as many offer sign language classes for free.

Ideally, you will have a volunteer instructor come to instruct your club, but you may need to be flexible.  Your club may need to come to the instructor.  If only a few people in your club are interested, you should join a class that meets outside of Pathfinder time.  If you invite an instructor to teach at your club, be sure to tell her how many students to expect before you ask for a commitment.

Once you find a class and instruction begins, we ''highly'' recommend that you take ''five'' hours of instruction rather than just the three required.  It will be a lot easier to continue instruction until you have all five hours as opposed to resuming classes sometime in the future.

==3. Send and receive finger spelling at the rate of five words per minute using a minimum of 25 letters. ==
===Tips===
When you are first learning to sign the letters, a good Bible text to practice with is Philippians 4:8, as it repeats the phrase &quot;whatever is&quot; several times.  Since it is so repetitive, You should be able to quickly sign the &quot;whatever is&quot; portion to get your speed up.  This verse contains all the letters of the alphabet except j, q, and z which can be learned afterwards.  Learning a text such as this will also force you to learn each letter on its own (as opposed to always signing K after J).  Once a text such as this one has been learned you may be surprised that you can finger spell just about anything.

{{Bible verse
| book = Philippians
| chapter = 4
| verse =8
| version = NIV
| text =
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
}}

===Graphically===
We present this Bible verse graphically here, showing the first 108 letters of the verse.  If you can sign this in under 4 minutes 20, seconds, you will have achieved 5 words per minute (assuming an average of 5 letters per word).

==4. Learn at least 100 signs from one or more of the below referenced books.==
*'''A Basic Course in Manual Communication''', T.J. O'Rourke, National Association of the Deaf, 814 Thayer Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20901.

*'''Ameslan, An Introduction to American Sign Language''', Louie Fant, Jr., Joyce Media, P.O. Box 458, Northridge, CA 91328. Play It By Sign, Ibid. (Joyce Media also has instructional films.)

*'''Joy of Signing''', Lottie, L. Riekehof, Gospel Publishing House, Springfield, MO.

*'''Talk to the Deaf''', Etc., Gallaudet College Press, Washington, D. C. 20002.

*'''Expressive and Receptive Fingerspelling for Hearing Adults''', La Vera M. Guillory, Claitor's Publishing Division, P.O. Box 3333, Baton Rouge, LA 70821.

*'''An Introduction to Manual English''', The Washington State School for the Deaf, Vancouver, WA 98661.

If you cannot find any of these books, substitute something equivalent.

*'''http://www.aslpro.com''', Contains three ASL dictionaries and study tools.

*'''http://www.lifeprint.com''', Also is an excellent source for learning ASL signs.

==5. Learn and present in sign language (not finger spelling) at least two simple songs. ==
The titles suggested below are popular Christian songs with few words, or words that repeat (that is our definition of ''simple'').  Repetition is very useful when learning something new, especially a language.
*God is so Good
*This Little Light of Mine
*I've Got the Joy in my Heart
*Rejoice in the Lord, Always

{{TODO|Find some freely licensed videos, upload them to the Commons, and include them here.}}

*'''First Noel'''. More challenging Christmas songs http://www.aslpro.com/poemsnsongs/firstnoel.html
*'''Silent Night'''. More challenging Christmas songs http://www.aslpro.com/poemsnsongs/silentnight.html

==6. Do one of the following: ==
===a. Explain the difference between Ameslan and signed English, and demonstrate the use of both. ===
Ameslan, or '''Ame'''rican '''S'''ign '''Lan'''guage, has little connection to English grammar.  This language was developed by the deaf community as an efficient and expressive method of communication.  Signed English, on the other hand, was designed with a more direct connection to English grammar, the theory being that knowing it would make reading and writing in English easier.  Signed English follows the same word order and syntax as spoken English, while the word order in Ameslan is conceptually-based.

===b. Read and give an oral or written report on a school in your country or state specializing in deaf education. ===
See the Wikipedia article [[w:Category:Schools_for_the_deaf|Schools for the Deaf]] for a list.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here's how the pros make a lightsaber.

=='''Step 1:''' ''The image''==
You need an image to edit, preferably of somebody holding something saber-ish, a sword, a stick. Or perhaps a fully-fledged lightsaber prop? Or something similar such as a Force-FX saber or just a hilt.

Google can do your thing, but watch out for copyrights.

=='''Step 2:''' ''The core effect''==
Now that you have got your image, it's time to start the effect. We begin by painting the core. That's the white blade in the middle. If you have a stick or a prop, use the line tool to cover it with white, or if you are in a self-destructive mood or have drawing specialised input tools, use the paintbrush.

[[Image:Lightsaer tut screenshot1.png]]

If you have no stick you can use the hilt or your empty hands as a guide, remember, lightsaber blades are roughly one meter long.

Make sure the line extends at least a little over the hilt or hands, then use the eraser to adjust it so it matches up with the emitter hole just nicely.

[[Image:Lightsaber tut screenshot2.jpg]]

Then use the paintbrush to round the other end. A flat saber is simply so boring.

[[Image:Lightsaber tut screenshot3.jpg]]

If the stick or imaginary so is obstructed by anything so should the core be, erase.

The core is more important than you might think, a well made core greatly contributes to the 3D-effect that makes the saber look like it's there.

=='''Step 3:''' ''The glow''==
Now, for the thing that makes the saber look bright and deadly, the glow.

Duplicate the core thrice;

[[Image:Lightsaber tut screenshot4.jpg]]

Set the layers to screen, I have found this looks very similar to real photographic glows;

[[Image:Lightsaber tut screenshot5.jpg]]

Now use gaussian blur on each of the layers in incremental values. Like for example: 10, 20, 30. Or 10, 20, 40.

[[Image:Lightsaber tut screenshot6.jpg]]

[[Image:Lightsaber tut screenshot7.jpg]]

It depends on what kind of glow you want. The amount of blur also depends on the size of the image.

Now merge the layers.

[[Image:Lightsaber tut screenshot8.jpg]]

=='''Step 4:''' ''The colour''==
The saber needs colour now. A white saber is simply so boring. The choice of colour is a good start. Remember, canonically there's only four colours. Red = bad. Blue &amp;amp; green = good. And then purple, for awesome.

But the expanded universe gives you the option for any colour you like, be it hot pink or rainbow gradient. Although I won't detail how to do the latter here.

You can apply the colour in two ways. By using levels, and by using recolour.

Levels: Open levels and adjust the colour sliders for the glow layer until it has the hue you want, some interesting and glow-ish effects can be achieved with this.

Recolour: I like this because it gives me better control over the hue, and I can always use levels after that, but thats just me. Select the colour you want for primary, and white for secondary. Use 100 px brush to go over the entire glow.

You're pretty much done now. But there's some finishing, although optional touches that can really make the saber better.

=='''Step 5:''' ''The light''==
Lightsabers, are as the name suggest, light sources. You may want to add &quot;Interactive Lighting&quot;. Force FX sabers light up, so they pretty much do the job for you, but you may want to enhance the effect as it isn't quite bright enough for a lightsaber. Or you can add additional light when you take the photo with lamps.

For digitally making the effect:

Make a new layer, use a tinted brush to paint a not-too-thick line or dot on the surfaces you want lit. Use much Gaussian blur. you may want to make several layers for surfaces that aren't parallel or need different amounts of light. You may also want to expand the canvas considerably for the next procedure.

Make selection boxes around the entire blurred lines and dots and use rotate/zoom to give them proper perspective.

Then use the eraser to go over the places that wouldn't receive light, such as the background behind a person or object, or on the shadow side of things, or maybe some things are shaded by another object?

Merge your light layers.

Duplicate it, then set the lower layer to overlay, and the upper to reflect. Make the reflect layer of limited opacity.

If the image has very dark areas you may want to use yet another layer to make a light foundation with screen. Again, with limited opacity.

=='''Step 6:''' ''The reflections''==
Now, bright stuff reflect very visibly. Your forceFX may have left guide reflections or maybe your stick blatantly shows up? Anyways paint reflections with a tinted brush, then a smaller white one. Set the layer to... you guessed it, reflect. Again, of limited opacity.

If there's a big mirror you may want to make an entirely new saber effect for it instead.

=='''Step 7:''' ''The adjustments''==
The final touches.

Make yet another glow that is very small and completely white, and only one duplication. It gives the saber an extra sense of brightness.

Make sure the layers are layered like this:

# Small glow
# Glow
# Core
# Interactive light reflect
# Interactive light overlay
# Interactive light screen
# Reflections
# Background

You may also want to adjust all the layers opacity settings so everything looks exactly perfect.

The idea of a saber glow is usually that it's perfect, artifactless. But you may want to add artifacts anyways. Duplicate the glow several times and move the dupes along an imaginary 3d-line of varying sizes and intensity.

You could also duplicate the core and stretch it with motion blur, of limited opacity.

If the image is old or of low quality you may want to adjust your saber equally. say, the image lacks contrast? The core probably shouldn't be pure white. Find the image's pure white and apply it to the core.

Is it grainy? Saber not excused. Apply grain. Etc, etc.

Remember when you initially make your saber effect to take into account the lighting conditions of the image, if it's dark the saber should appear very bright, if the sun is in the shot... probably not quite so.

If you have followed all the steps, you are very dedicated and now should have a very fine saber effect.

But mostly you'll probably just want to stick with the first 4 steps. There's not many who cares for all the mostly unnecessary extra work. But if you do happen to care...

But remember, don't slavishly follow a tutorial, everybody has their own idea of lightsabers, find yours. Stick to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Waitak,

I heard you were interested in a Mongolian wikibook? I'd be glad to help in this project, and actually have some recources that might be useful to you. Look here how I'm doing the [[Uzbek]] book. I also have the Peace Corps books in Mongolian, and can get you the pdf's if you'll make a commitment to do the same thing for them that I have been doing with Uzbek. It's quite a lot of work typing it in, you can't just copy and paste. --but you might learn some Mongolian in the process.

Let me know on my talk page if you are interested.

= Zell- und Gewebsschäden =

== Schäden der Zellorganellen ==

Viele pathologische Prozesse führen zu mehr oder weniger spezifischen Veränderungen einzelner Zellorganellen in bestimmten Zellpopulationen. Diese sind neben der Histologie und anatomischen Pathologie vielfach wegweisend bei der Diagnose und Beurteilung von Erkrankungen.

=== Zellkern ===

* '''Unspezifische Reaktionen des Zellkerns auf Noxen'''
** Kernschwellung 
** Kernpyknose - Kernschrumpfung durch Kondensation des Chromatins
** Karyorrhexis - Kernfragmentierung
** Karyolyse - Kernzerfall
** Apoptose - Suizidprogramm der Zelle, ausgelöst durch Aktivierung des Fas-Ligand-Rezeptor-Weges oder Freisetzung von Cytochrom C aus den Mitochondrien -&gt; morphologisch: Apoptosekörperchen

* '''Kerneinschlüsse'''
** Glykogen („Lochkerne“) - Z.B. bei Diabetes mellitus 
** Zytoplasma („Milchglaskerne“) - Z.B. beim papillären Schilddrüsenkarzinom 
** Viren („Eulenaugen“) - Einschluss von Virusmaterial, z.B. bei CMV-Infektion

* '''Mehrkernige Riesenzellen''' - Sie entstehen durch Verschmelzung mehrerer Zellen oder bei inhibierter Zellteilung und kommen sowohl physiologisch als auch im Rahmen pathologischer Prozesse vor.
** Physiologisch: Skelettmuskelzellen, Megakaryozyten, Osteoklasten, Trophoblast
** Pathologisch:
*** Histiozytäre Zellen:
**** Fremdkörper-Riesenzellen - Typisch in Fremdkörpergranulomen, die Zellkerne sind in einem Haufen zusammengelagert

**** Riesenzelle bei Epulis
*** Tumor-Riesenzellen:
**** R&lt;small&gt;EED&lt;/small&gt;-S&lt;small&gt;TERNBERG&lt;/small&gt;-Riesen-Zellen (Morbus H&lt;small&gt;ODGKIN&lt;/small&gt;)

=== Systemische Entzündungsreaktion ===

* Akute-Phase-Reaktion bzw. SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)
* Sepsis = SIRS mit Nachweis einer Infektion

SIRS ist eine sterotype unspezifischen Immunreaktion des Organismus auf Gewebsschädigungen (Verletzungen, operative Eingriffe, Infektionen, Verbrennungen). Bei Dekompensation wird die inflammatorische Kaskade zum Selbstäufer und kann nicht mehr gestoppt werden (circulus vitiosus).

'''Enzündungsmediatoren'''

Endothelzellen, Fibroblasten und Gewebsmakrophagen im geschädigten Gewebe setzen Entzündungsmediatoren frei, z.B. IL 1, IL 6, TNF-α, Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β), IF-γ, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Leukozyten induzierender Faktor (LIF) u.a., die einerseits für  lokalen Effekte verantwortlich sind und andererseits in Anwesenheit von Cortisol die Leber zur vermehrten Synthese der etwa 30 verschiedenen Akute-Phase-Proteine stimulieren, deren  Konzentration innerhalb von 6-48 Stunden nach dem schädigenden Ereignis auf das zwei- bis eintausendfache zunimmt. 

'''Akute-Phase-Proteine'''

Aufgabe:
* Lokalisierung der Entzündung
* Verhinderung der Ausbreitung
* Unterstützung des Immunsystems bei der Sanierung des Entzündungsherdes

Beispiele für Akute-Phase-Proteine: 
* Fibrinogen -&gt; lokale Thrombusbildung im Entzündungsgebiet -&gt; Erreger werden nicht weiter in die Blutbahn ausgeschwemmt. 
* α1-Antitrypsin und α-Antichymotrypsin -&gt; reduzieren als Anti-Proteasen die Gewebsschädigung.
* C-Reaktives-Protein -&gt; Opsonierung
* Saures Alpha1-Glykoprotein
* Haptoglobin
* Coeruloplasmin
* Komplement-C3
* Plasminogen
* Transferrin

'''Stresshormone'''

Weiterhin werden die klassischen Stresshormone Adrenalin, Noradrenalin und Cortisol, sowie weitere Hormone (ADH, Aldosteron) freigesetzt. Diese Hormone dienen u.a. der Kreislaufstabilisierung durch Vasokonstriktion, Natrium- und Wasserretention (ggf. Zentralisation) und der Energiebereitstellung (Lipolyse, Glykogenolyse, Glukoneogenese).  

'''Bakterielle Zellwandprodukte''' (bei Sepsis, bes. LPS gramneg. Keime)

bakterielle Zellwandprodukte -&gt;

* -&gt; Komplementaktivierung und 
* -&gt; primäre Mediatoren (TNF,IL1,IFN..) -&gt; Leukozytenaktivierung -&gt; sekundäre Mediatoren (PAF, Eicosanoide, IL)
** =&gt; Aktivierung von PMN -&gt; Kapillar- und Endothelschäden -&gt; Volumenverlust ins Interstitium
* -&gt; ACTH/Endorphine -&gt; Gerinnungsaktivierung -&gt; Aktivierung d. Kallikrein-Kinin-Systems -&gt; Vasdodilatation, Endothelschäden -&gt; absoluter und relativer Volumenverlust
** ==&gt;&gt; [[Pathologie:_Zell-_und_Gewebssch%C3%A4den#Schock|Schock]], MOV, DIC 
*** ===&gt;&gt;&gt; Tod

'''Klinische Symptome''':
* Fieber &gt; 38 °C oder &lt; 36 °C

'''Embryopathien'''

Entscheidend ist der Zeitpunkt und das Ausmaß des Schädigung, die Art der Noxe ist weniger bedeutsam.

* Fetales Alkoholsyndrom (FAS, Alkoholembryopathie) - Weblink: [http://www.fasworld.de/ Fasworld.de]

* Akromegalie (nach Epiphysenschluss)

== Regeneration ==

Die Regenerationsfähigkeit verhält sich reziprok zur Gewebedifferenzierung.

* Physiologische Regeneration
** Einmalig: Milchgebiss
** Zyklisch: Endometrium
** Dauernd: „Mausergewebe“, z.B. Endothel, Epidermis, hämatopoetisches System, Spermatogenese

* Pathologische bzw. reparative Regeneration 
** Vollständig: Restitutio ad integrum.
** Unvollständig: Defektheilung mit Bildung von Ersatzgewebe (Narbe).

'''Wundheilung'''

Phasen:
* Exsudationsphase (seröses Exsudat, Antikörper, Fibrin, Plasmafaktoren)
* Resorptionsphase (Immunzellen)
* Proliferationsphase (Fibroblasten, Myofibroblasten, Kapillareinsprossung (Granulationsgewebe), Epithelialisierung)
* Reparationsphase (Bildung extrazellulärer Matrix, Kollagen) -&gt; Narbe (nach 3 Monaten volle Belastbarkeit)

Formen der Wundheilung:
* Primäre Wundheilung (per primam, p.p.) - Frische, saubere Wunde, adaptierte Wundränder - rasche Heilung, geringe Narbenbildung
* Sekundäre Wundheilung (per secundam, p.s.) - Ältere, offene, infizierte Wunden - Heilung aus der Tiefe, längere Heilungsdauer, Narbenbildung

Störungen:

|}

'''Knochenheilung nach Frakturen'''

Arten der Knochenheilung:
* Primäre/direkte Knochenheilung (nur bei anatomischer Reposition und Ruhigstellung, Osteosynthese) : direkte knöcherne Überbrückung des Frakturspalts (Osteoklasten bohren sich in den gegenüberliegenden Knochen, Osteblasten füllen die verbindenden Kanälchen wieder auf). 
* Sekundäre/indirekte Knochenheilung (bei konservativer Frakturbehandlung) : Frakturhämatom -&gt; Kallusbildung (bindegewebige Organisation) -&gt; Faserknochen -&gt; Lamellenknochen

Störungen:
* Pseudarthrose - Bindegewebige Überbrückung des Frakturspalts. Hypertrophe Pseudarthrose durch mangelnde Ruhigstellung, atrophe Pseudarthrose durch mangelnde Versorgung.
* Frakturkrankheit, S&lt;small&gt;UDECK&lt;/small&gt;-Dystrophie - Lokale Atrophie und Schrumpfung von Muskeln, Knorpel, Knochen, Gelenkkapsel und Bandapparat in der Nähe der Fraktur durch chronische Störungen der Trophik (Mikrozirkulation, Innervation).
* V&lt;small&gt;OLKMANN&lt;/small&gt;-Kontraktur - Ischämische und/oder neurogene Kontraktur der Armmuskulatur nach inadäquat versorgter Humerusfraktur mit Kompression der A. brachialis, des N. ulnaris, des N. medianus oder anderer Strukturen. Nekrose und Atrophie der Unterarmmuskulatur, besonders der Flexoren, die Hand befindet sich häufig in Krallenhandstellung.
* Osteomyelitis - Bakterielle Entzündung des Knochenmarks, insbesondere bei offenen Frakturen zu erwarten.

'''Nervenheilung'''

Periphere Nerven können heilen, da sich jede Schwannsche Gliazelle in zahlreichen Windungen um jeweils nur ein Axon wickelt und nach Absterben des Axons die Axonhülle stehen bleibt. Im ZNS isolieren Oligodendrozyten gleichzeitig zahlreiche Axone, hier ist keine Heilung möglich.

Verletzung mit Durchtrennung des Axons -&gt; W&lt;small&gt;ALLER&lt;/small&gt;'sche Degeneration des peripheren Axonteils -&gt; proximales Axon wächst wieder in die stehengebliebende periphere Axonhülle (ca. 1mm/Tag). Voraussetzung: Genaue Adaptation, z.B. durch Nervennaht.

Störungen: 
* Neurom - Bei Amputationsverletzungen oder nicht adaptierten durchtrennten Nerven wachsen die Axone unkontrolliert aus und bilden schmerzempfindliche Nervenfaserknoten.

== Tumorpathologie ==

Gutartige und bösartige (Krebs) Tumoren sind quasi der Preis für die Regenerationsfähigkeit der Gewebe. Es handelt sich dabei um Ansammlungen von Zellen mit überschießendem und unkontrollierten Wachstum. 

'''Tumorklassifikation'''
* Typing : Histologischer Typ (welches Ursprungsgewebe ahmt der Tumor nach)
* Grading : 3 Malignitätsgrade (gegenläufig zum Differenzierungsgrad)
* Staging : Ausbreitung (TNM-Schema)

'''Einteilung der Tumoren nach Dignität'''

* Benigne - Verdrängend wachsend, langsam wachsend, oft abgekapselt, Organgrenzen respektierend, Ausdifferenzierung der Zellen, keine Metastasenbildung.
* Maligne - Infiltrativ-invasiv wachsend, rasch wachsend -&gt; Nekrosen, unreife, atypische Zellen, Metastasen.
* Semimaligne - Lokal destruierend, selten Metastasen bildend.

'''Kriterien der Malignität'''

* Makroskopisch: Infiltrierend/diffus wachsend
* Histologisch: Nekrosen, Kapillarisierung (Neoangiogenese), Aufhebung der normalen Histologie.
* Zytologisch: Polymorphie, basophiles Cytoplasma, erhöhte Kern/Plasmarelation
* Nukleär: Polymorphie, Polychromasie, Hyperchromasie, Aneuploidie, (vergrößerte) Nukleolen, vermehrt Mitosen, atypische Mitosen, erhöhter Proliferationsindex (Ki-67 = MIB-1).

'''Kanzerogenese'''

Mutagene:
* Chemikalien
** Aromatische polyzyklische Kohlenwasserstoffe: Benzpyren, Anthrazen, Tabakrauch, Abgase
** Aromatische Amine: Anilin, Aflatoxin (Aspergillus flavus), Benzidin, Benzol, Epoxide, Nitrosamine
* Pharmaka (Zytostatika)
* Viren: Virale Onkogene v-onc (Physiologische Protoonkogene (c-onc), zB. c-erb oder Bcl2, die durch Virus-DNA-Insertion verändert werden), Bsp.: HPV 16, 18 Zervixkarzinom
* Ionisierende Strahlung
* Chronische Entzündungen (Colitis ulcerosa)
* Präkanzeröse Konditionen (XP, FAP, HNPCC u.a.)

Synkanzerogenese: Mutagene können sich bezüglich einer bestimmten Tumorentität additiv, überadditiv oder multiplikativ zueinander verhalten. Bsp.: Das Risiko für ein Bronchialkarzinom wird durch Asbestexposition 5x erhöht, durch Rauchen 10x. Asbest und Rauchen verhalten sich beim BC multiplikativ, das Risiko für einen Asbestexponierten Raucher ein BC zu entwickeln liegt also 50fach höher als beim nicht-rauchenden Bevölkerungsdurchschnitt!

Durch genetische Mutationen (ein Allel betroffen) kann die individuelle Anfälligkeit erhöht sein! 

Wichtige Mutagene und Risikofaktoren nach Organsystemen:
* Atemwege: 
** Nasen und NNH: Eichen- und Buchenholzstäube, Nickelverbindungen, Zinkchromat
** Rachen: HPV, Rauchen, Alkohol
** Larynx: HPV, Asbest, polyzyklische aromatische Kohlenwasserstoffe (PAH)
** Lunge: Rauchen, Passivrauchen, Radon, aromatische Amine, Arsen, Asbest, Beryllium, Bischlordimethylether, Cadmiumverbindungen, chromhaltiger Staub, Hartmetalle (Wolframkarbid, Cobalt), Faserstäube, ionisierende Strahlen, Monochlordimethylether, Nickelverbindungen, Nitrosamine, PAH, Teer, Zinkchromat, Quarzstaub, Senfgas, Thorium, Uran 
** Pleura: Asbest
* Seröse Häute (Pleura, Peritoneum, Tuncica vaginalis, Perikard): Asbest
* MDT:
** Magen: Helicobacter pylori, Nitrosamine
** Darm: Faserarme Ernährung, Nitrosamine, Adipositas
** Leber: Arsen, Vinylchlorid, chronische Hepatitis B und C
** Gallengänge: Leberegel (Clonorchis, Opisthorchis)
* Harnwege: 4-Aminodiphenyl, Benzidin, 4-Chlor-o-Toluidin, 2-Naphthylamin, Azofarbstoffe, Bilharziose, Arsen, Nitrosamine
* Haematopoetisches System: Benzol, ionisierende Strahlen, Trisomie 21
* Haut: UV-Licht, Arsen, Teer, ionisierende Strahlen

Genotoxine erhöhen die Inzidenz maligner Tumoren, sie vorverlagern den Erkrankungszeitpunkt (= Verkürzung der Latenzzeit) und sie erweitern das Tumorspektrum in einem Gewebe.

Mechanismen:
* Punktmutationen: Basenaustausch, Addition, Deletion
* Translokation (zB. t9/22 -&gt; Philadelphia-Chromosom Bcr-Abl)
* Amplifikation

Folgen:
* Aktivierung von Protoonkogenen c-onc, die physiologisch vorkommen und für an der Proliferation beteiligte Gene kodieren, zB.  Wachstumsfaktoren, Wachstumsfaktorrezeptoren, Tyrosinkinasen u.a.
* Abschaltung von Tumorsupressorgenen, zB. DNA-Reparaturgene, Cycline 

Formale Pathogenese:
* Initiation - Initialer DNA-Schaden, Mutation
* Latenz - Bis zu Jahrzehnten!
* Promotion - Weitere Mutationen, Hormonwirkung
* Progression - Entartung

Letztlich entsteht ein Tumor nicht von heute auf morgen, sondern die Zellen entarten über zahlreiche Zwischenschritte, bei denen diverse Gene an- und abgeschaltet werden. Bsp.: '''Adenom-Karzinom-Sequenz''' bei Darmkrebs unter Beteilung des Oncogens c-Ki-ras und der Tumorsupressorgene p53, APC, DCC u.a.m. Betroffen sind besonders Gewebe mit hoher regeneratorischer Aktivität (Epithel -&gt; Karzinom, Knochenmark/Immunsystem -&gt; Leukämie, Lymphome). Die Zunahme der Zellteilungen durch die Entartung beschleunigt dabei die Anhäufung von Mutationen im Sinne eines Circulus vitiosus und die Entstehung verschieden gut angepasster Zellklone, was den Tumorzellen einen Selektions- und Wachstumsvorteil gegenüber den körpereigenen Abwehrmechanismen und Geweben beschert. 

'''Invasion'''

Abfolge:
* Orientierung (Lamininrezeptoren)
* Lokale Proteolyse (Cathepsin D, Kollagenasen)
* Dissoziation - Die Krebszelle zieht die Adhäsionsmoleküle ein, kann den Zellverband verlassen, Verlust der Kontaktinhibition)
* Lokomotion (Migration)

'''Metastasierung'''

Abfolge:
* Infiltration - Einwachsen in umliegende Gewebe
* Invasion - Eindringen in Blut- und Lymphwege
* Disseminierung (lymphogen, hämatogen) - Verteilung im Organismus
* Arrest im Zielorgan - Adhäsion an Rezeptoren oder Oberflächenmoleküle oder Steckenbleiben von Tumorzellemboli im Kapillarbett.
** Reinvasion - Einwachsen ins Zielorgan
** Angiogenese - Der Tumor bildet angiogenetische Wachstumsfaktoren, die das Wachstum neuer Gefäße stimulieren. 
** Anschluß an Arteriolen
** Arterialisierung des Tumors (keine Venenbildung!)

Metastasierungswege:
* Lymphogen - Über die Lymphwege
* Hämatogen - Über den Blutweg (direkt oder erst lymphogen und dann über den Angulus venosus Eintritt in die Zirkulation)
* Kanalikulär - Entlang seröser Häute
* Per continuitatem - Direkt durchwachsend

Metastasierungstypen:
* Cava-Typ : Organ -&gt; Lunge
* Arterieller Typ : Lunge -&gt; Körper
* Pfortadertyp : GIT -&gt; Leber
* Paravertebraler Venenplexus-Typ : Organ -&gt; Wirbelsäule (Mamma-, Prostata-, Ovarial-Ca)
* Cavitär : Organ -&gt; Pleura, Peritoneum, Pericard
* Lymphogen-hämatogen : Lymphgefäß -&gt; Ductus thoracicus -&gt; Venewinkel -&gt; Blutbahn

'''Folgen der Tumorerkrankung'''
* Kompression umliegender Strukturen
* Stenosierung
* Ulzeration
* Gefäßarrosion
* Fistelung
* Nekrose
* Abflussstörungen 
* Anämie (Ursachen: Chronische Blutung, Hämatopoesehemmung durch Tumorfaktoren, Knochenmarksverdrängung durch Metastasen, AIHA)
* Gewichtsverlust
* Paraneoplastische Syndrome (U: Entstehen indirekt durch vom Tumor freigesetzte Zerfallsprodukte und hormonähnliche Substanzen an primär nicht betroffenen Organen und Autoimmunphänomene (Kreuzantigenität)) Bsp.: 
** Hautveränderungen (Akanthose, Acanthosis nigricans maligna, Hyperkeratose, Dermatomyositis, Bullöses Pemphigoid)
** Hämatologische Veränderungen (Anämie, leukämoide Reaktionen, Polyzythämie, Thrombosen, Nichtbakterielle thrombotische Endokarditis NBTE)
** Endokrinopathien (M. Cushing (ACTH), Schwartz-Bartter-Syndrom (SIADH), Hyperkalzämie (PTH), Hypoglykämien (Insulin), Karzinoidsyndrom (5-HT, Histamin, Bradykinin), Polyzythämie (EPO))
** Myasthenia gravis (bei Thymomen)
** Paraneoplastische Kleinhirnatrophie, Polyneuritis
** Glomerulonephritis

'''Spontane Tumorregression'''

Zerstörung von Tumorgewebe durch Makrophagen, NK, CD8-Zellen, AK
(durch Kreuzantigenität auch Autoaggressionserkrankungen)

'''Spontanremission'''

Vollständige oder teilweise, vorübergehende oder dauerhafte Rückbildung sämtlicher oder einiger Aktivitätsmerkmale einer bösartigen Erkrankung, ohne Behandlung oder unter einer Behandlung, wo dies nicht zu erwarten gewesen wäre. Nicht unbedingt gleichbedeutend mit Heilung (Spontanheilung)!

Häufigkeit: 1:60.000 bis 1:100.000, Dunkelziffer!

In mehr als der Hälfte der Fälle betrifft die Spontanremission folgende Tumore:
Malignes Melanom, malignen Lymphom, kindliche Neuroblastome, Nierenzellkarzinom

== Angeborene Fehlbildungen des Herzens ==

Ep.: 1:100 Neugeborene

=== Azyanotische Vitien ===

Herzfehler mit Links-rechts-Shunt ohne Zyanose und hyperkinetisch bedingter pulmonaler Hypertonie und Überdurchblutung der Lunge. 

==== Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ==== 

Der physiologische Verschluss nach der Geburt unterbleibt.

Folge: Kontinuierlicher (Windkessel!) Links-rechts-Shunt

{| align

|}

==== Atrial septal defect (ASD) ==== 

ASD I:

Es gibt zwei verschiedene ASDs, die sich aus der Embryologie erklären. Am Anfang sind beide Vorhöfe über das Foramen primum offen verbunden. Das Septum primum wächst von oben Richtung Herzskelett (Klappenebene) herunter und fusioniert dort mit einem Endokardkissen. Eine Störung dieser Fusion führt direkt über den Klappen zum offen Foramen primum, das in seiner vollen Ausprägung dem Atrioventrikulären Septumdefekt (AVSD) entspricht. Einen partieller AVSD (PAVSD) nennt man auch ASD I. Diese Fehlbildung ist häufig bei Trisomie 21 anzutreffen. Die Fehlbildung ist mit weiteren Störungen assoziiert, z.B. Reizleitungsstörungen durch Fehlentwicklung des Reizleitungssystems und einem fehlenden Sprung zwischen Mitral- und Trikuspidalebene. 

ASD II:

Das heruntergewachsene Septum primum reisst normalerweise in der Mitte ein und bildet das Foramen secundum bzw. Foramen ovale. Dieses wird durch das links vom Septum primum ebenfalls von oben herunterwachsende Septum secundum gardinenartig bedeckt (Ventil) und kurz nach der Geburt durch Umkehr der Druckverhältnisse funktionell (z.T. strukturell durch Verklebung) verschlossen. Ist der Verschluss so ungenügend, dass es zum Links-rechts-Shunt kommt, spricht man vom offenen Foramen ovale bzw. ASD II. Der ASD II ist im Ggs. zum ASD I weiter oben lokalisiert. Er macht oft wenig Symptome und wird oft erst im Erwachsenenalter erkannt. Der Links-Rechts-Shunt kann im EKG zu Zeichen der Rechtsherzbelastung führen (Rechtslagetyp, P pulmonale, inkompletter Rechtsschenkelblock ohne Hypertrophie-Zeichen (rsr's') als Zeichen der rechtsventrikulären Volumenbelastung) und bei starker Ausprägung zu klinischen Symptomen führen.

==== Ventricular septal defect (VSD) ==== 

Makro: Loch im Kammerseptum, meist im membranösen Teil.

Folge: Links-rechts-Shunt

{| align

|}

==== Truncus arteriosus ==== 

Ep.: Selten

Makro: Fehlende Trennung von Aorta und A. pulmonalis, oft 4-segelige Taschenklappe.

==== Atrioventrikulärer Kanal (AVSD) ==== 

Makro: Partielles Fehlen von Vorhof- und Ventrikelwand (siehe ASD I).

=== Zyanotische Vitien ===

Herzfehler mit Rechts-links-Shunt und dadurch Ausbildung einer Zyanose

==== Tetralogy of Fallot ==== 

Die Fallotsche Tetralogie ist ein komplexer Herzfehler mit einer 

* Pulmonalstenose, genauer gesagt mit einer Hypoplasie des rechtsventrikulären Ausflusstraktes (die auch entscheidend für die klinischen Symptome ist), einer 
* Rechtsherzhypertrophie als Folge der Stenose, einem
* Subaortalen (nicht perimembranösen) Ventrikelseptumdefekt und der 
* „Reitenden Aorta“. Letzteres meint, dass der Anfangsteil der Aorta nicht wie üblich links neben dem Septums liegt, sondern nach rechts-vorne direkt über das Septum bzw. hier über den VSD verschoben ist.  	

Klinik: Die Zyanose tritt erst einige Wochen nach der Geburt auf, da die Lunge pränatal kaum durchblutet ist und der rechte Ventrikel erst nach der Geburt belastet wird und hypertrophiert. Die Hypertrophie verstärkt im circulus vitiosus zunehmend die muskuläre Obstruktion des rechtsventrikulären Ausflusstraktes. Die Klinik der Obstruktion tritt dabei anfallsartig in Form „hypoxämischer Anfälle“ auf. Wenn unbehandelt, nimmt das Kind später im Anfall automatisch eine typische Hockstellung ein, um den venösen Rückfluss zu hemmen und das Herz zu entlasten.
Auskultatorisch fällt das pulmonale Stenosegeräusch auf. Der VSD erzeugt wegen dem Druckausgleich zwischen linker und rechter Kammer kaum Turbulenzen und ist daher kaum zu hören. 

==== Transposition of great vessels (TGA) ==== 

Makro: Die Aorta ist - inklusive der Koronarien - mit dem rechten, die Pulmonalis mit dem linken Ventrikel verbunden. Die Kreisläufe sind nicht seriell sondern parallel geschaltet. Die periphere Sauerstoffversorgung kann sich nach der Geburt sehr rasch und lebensbedrohlich verschlechtern durch Verschluss der embryonalen Kurzschlüsse (Foramen ovale, Ductus arteriosus B&lt;small&gt;OTALLI&lt;/small&gt;). 

Klinik: Hyperaktives Präkordium, Zyanose

=== Sonstige Vitien ===

==== Pulmonalstenose / Pulmonalatresie ==== 

Makro: Verengung des pulmonalen Ausflusstraktes. Bei relevanter Druckbelastung entwickelt sich eine Rechtsherzhypertrophie.

==== Aortenstenose ==== 

Makro: Sub-, supra- oder valvuläre Stenose der Aorta aszendens. Folge ist eine Linksherzhypertrophie durch Druckbelastung.

==== Coarctation of aorta ==== 

Makro: Es handelt sich um eine hinter dem Abgang der linken A. subclavia gelegene Verengung der Aorta. 

Es gibt zwei Formen:

* Die proximale, präduktale (supraduktale) oder infantile Form, die vor dem Ductus arteriosus gelegen ist (95 % der Fälle). Das Blut fließt von der A. pulmonalis über den offenen Ductus in die Aorta deszendens und führt zur Zyanose der unteren Körperhälfte (Differentialzyanose).
* Die distale, postduktale (infraduktale) oder adulte Form, die hinter dem Ductus arteriosus liegt (5 % der Fälle) geht mit einem geschlossenen Ductus arteriosus einher. Folgen sind Bluthochdruck in der oberen Körperhälfte mit Linksherzhypertrophie und Aortendilatation, sowie die Ausbildung eines Umgehungskreislaufs (Aa. thoracicae internae, Aa. intercostales, Ae. epigastricae)  

Klinik der infantilen Form: Die Kinder sind bei Geburt typischerweise &quot;gesund&quot; (und passieren oft auch unbemerkt die U2), da die Stenose durch den offenen Ductus arteriosus umgangen wird und auskultatorisch kaum etwas zu hören ist. Die '''Femoralispulse''' sind allerdings häufig schon abgeschwächt und ihre Palpation ist die wichtigste diagnostische Maßnahme! Nach etwa 10 bis 14 Tagen entwickeln die Kinder durch den Verschluß des Ductus arteriosus unspezifische Symptome der Linksherzinsuffizienz wie Tachypnoe, Gewichtszunahme (kaum sicht- oder hörbare Ödeme) und Symptome der peripheren Minderperfusion wie Oligurie/Anurie, Trinkschwäche, Verlängerung der Rekapillarisierungszeit, kühle untere Extremitäten. Die Kinder können dann sehr rasch am - im Grunde vermeidbaren - Herzversagen sterben. In diesem Stadium erkannte Kinder müssen sofort notfallmässig behandelt werden, um sie zu retten.
  
==== Hypoplastic left heart syndrome ==== 


Makro: Hypotrophie des linken Herzens, defekte Mitral- und Aortenklappe

==== Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) ==== 

Makro: Die Pulmonalvenen erreichen nicht das linke Atrium, sondern die Portalvene (Pulmonalvene -&gt; Portalvene -&gt; Leber -&gt; V. cava inferior -&gt; rechter Vorhof -&gt; Foramen ovale und Ductus Botalli -&gt; Körperkreislauf -&gt; Lunge) oder den Sinus coronarius.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kdenlive''' (pronounced ''Kay-den-live'') stands for ''KDE Non-Linear Video Editor'', and it is, well, a [[Kdenlive/Basics of Non-Linear Video Edition|non-linear video]] editing suite for the KDE desktop.

Kdenlive is Free-software. The project was initially started by Jason Wood in 2002, and is now maintained by a small team of developers. Kdenlive aims to become the most advanced non-linear video editor under GNU/Linux.

Most of this documentation is based on version 0.5 which is the version of Kdenlive for KDE3.

Kdenlive is currently under heavy development, based on KDE4. This version is called 0.7, and its interface differs in many subtle ways from Kdenlive 0.5. Kdenlive 0.5 is deprecated, and at this point (Oct. 2008) more or less unsupported.

This wiki is in a transitional state, moving from documenting the 0.5 version to the 0.7 version. It's therefore possible that some options or features are explained different here than in the version you are using. Some features from 0.5 are not yet supported in 0.7, but will be supported in future releases.

=Supported Formats and Codecs=
To make short, Kdenlive is the most versatile video editor available today:
&lt;!-- I added this section because most users are looking for a simple answer : does Kdenlive support DV, Mpeg2 and HDV  --&gt;
* No need to import/convert footage prior to editing. Kdenlive knows how to handle any format smoothly.
* Support for Low resolution camera and camcorder files, including:
** [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV DV] editing (Raw and AVI).
** Mpeg2, mpeg4 and h264 AVCHD (small cameras and camcorders),
** 4:3 and 16:9 [[Kdenlive/Video systems|screen sizes]], PAL and NTSC systems,
* Support for high resolution camcorder files, including:
** mpeg2 HDV. 
** h264 AVCHD HDV. 
** Native [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDV HDV]  editing, 720 and 1080, interlaced or full frames. Support for larger resolutions can added using the extensible MLT framework.
* Support for brand new codecs and formats:
** SNOW lossless codec,
** Ogg vorbis, etc ...
* Ability to mix different video sources in a single project. For example, you can edit a film using two sources : a small mpeg4 camera and an HDV mpeg2 camcorder.
** Any resolution. Kdenlive will adapt resolution of source files to the resolution of the project.
** Any frame rate (from 15fps to 30 fps). Kdenlive can duplicate/remove frames when needed.
* Export to most formats
** Export to any format supported by ffmeg, including DV (PAL and NTSC), Mpeg2 (PAL, NTSC and HDV) and AVCHD (HDV).
** Export to any DV devices,
** Create a DVD with chapters and a simple menu (with k3b, xine, and dvdauthor)
* One format however that Kdenlive cannot handle is SWF which needs to be reformatted first.

=Video editing features=
&lt;!-- COMMENT: You will probably notice that I have shortened the list a LOT. With all the respect to the previous contributors, I think that it´s better to put only some (the most important) features here, as many of them will certainly become &quot;old and cold&quot; with the release of newer versions of Kdenlive, and will anyways be treated in the rest of the manual. Maybe a good idea, however, is to create a &quot;What´s New&quot; section, if the Kdenlive new site does not contain one. --&gt;
* Multitrack edition with a timeline and virtually unlimited number of video and audio tracks, plus facilities for splitting audio and video from a clip in multiple tracks
* Non-blocking rendering. You can keep working on a project at the same time a project is being transformed into a video file
* [[Kdenlive/Effects|Effects]] and [[Kdenlive/Transitions|transitions]] can be used with ease, and you can even create some wipe transitions of your own!
* Simple tools for easy creation of color clips, text clips and image clips
* Automatic slideshows creation from pictures directories, with crossfade transitions among the images
* Configurable keyboard shortcuts and interface layouts
* and much more!

=Underlying frameworks=
Choosing kdenlive is interesting, because it relies on two important and active free-software projects:

==The MLT Framework==
kdenlive is a graphical interface to the [http://www.dennedy.org/mlt/twiki/bin/view/MLT/WebHome MLT framework], which is the core and soul of Kdenlive. Its name comes from &quot;mutton, lettuce and tomato&quot;, but, instead of being a tasteful sandwich, it is an open-source framework for multimedia, specially directed to television broadcast.

==ffmpeg==
[http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/index.html ffmpeg] is a complete solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. It includes libavcodec, the leading audio/video codec library. FFmpeg is the most active Free-software project producing audio/video codecs. MLT relies on ffmpeg. When a codec is added in ffmpeg, you can be sure that Kdenlive can support it.

=License=
Kdenlive is released under the [http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html GPL (GNU Public License)]. Briefly, this means that Kdenlive is ''free'' in the meaning that you can copy it as much as you want, distribute it to anyone, and modify it as long as your modifications don´t change its freedom state.

And, well, it is ''free'' as in ''free beer'' as well :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Digital video''' is a generic term for pictures, with motion or not, that were changed to a format of sequenced numbers (''digitized'') for being stored in a computer file or a distribution medium, like a DVD, in a way that it can be read by a computer. The digital video files can be made from an analog source, such as a 35mm film movie or a VHS videocassete tape; or captured from a camera or device which does the analog/digital conversion internally and already outputs the video in digital format; or it can be completely generated in a computer, which is the case of an animation, a slideshow, or simply a text to be shown on-screen.

After a video is recorded and digitized, it can be ''edited'' with specialized electronic equipment or with a computer, and the latter allows the use of a simple and efficient method ---  '''non-linear editing'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before editing video on computer was possible, most editing was done on ''linear editors'' --- these work by having essentially, two video recorders. The first would hold the video that you are editing together, and the second would be used to find the next clip that you want to record. Find a clip, record it, find the next clip, record it. This is called linear editing because the medium of tape forced things to be edited sequentially. If you have edited 10 minutes worth of footage together, and decide that you made a mistake after five minutes, you can't just &quot;push&quot; the last five minutes around to add space for new clips.

'''Non-linear editing''' is by far a more flexible way of editing. You can place clips anywhere within your final video (in Kdenlive, this is represented via the timeline), and you can move them around as much as you want, rearrange them in a completely different order. Best of all, at any point during this you can press play and (with a sufficiently powerful computer) watch back what you have done there and then.

===Herbal Medicine===
Vervain can be chopped finely and boiled with water to make tea.  The tea has been used as a herbal remedy for insomnia at night and for general ailments during the day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Effects''' change the way that an audio or a video clip is shown in your video. They can be used for some little improvements, like filtering color blurs in the image or hum interference in the sound, or for surreal, impressive modifications like turning an image to its negative form, changing colors, adding a &quot;vinyl-like&quot; sound to your clips, and so on. They can be combined in a multitude of ways. Once the effects are provided by the editor software, its use depends only on the user creativity --- ok, some processing power too :)

In the following pages you can see in details which effects are available in Kdenlive, with descriptions of what they do and the meaning of their settings:

      <comment>/* Known bugs */ *.75 - System freezes while rendering (Fedora 11)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">No software is free of bugs, those little pests which can make your video look or sound weird, or can suddenly close your project without warning. Sometimes it looks like computers have life... who knows. Some other times, however, the problem is between the keyboard and the chair :)

Although Kdenlive is already extremely useful and packed with functionality, it is ''not yet'' a finished product. As with any other software project, the development process, solves some bugs and create others. As of Aug 2009, the latest stable version is 0.75.

'''If you are using an older version, please update!''' This manual can not cover bugs and limitations which were corrected in the latest versions.

Your help is welcome to hunt bugs. The recommended steps for hunting bugs are as follows:

== Reporting a bug ==
The recommended steps for reporting bugs are as follows:

=== Installing Kdenlive and MLT from SVN ===
First, make sure you [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kdenlive/Getting_and_installing#Installing_from_SVN install Kdenlive from SVN]. Compile Kdenlive and MLT with debugging support:
 ./configure --prefix=your_path --enable-debug=full ;
 make clean ;
 make ;
 make install

When compiling, you may be interested in the log:
 export LANG=C;
 make 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee kdenlive-compile.log
 tar -czf kdenlive-compile.tar.gz kdenlive-compile.log

You can automate the task of building a debug version of KDEnlive based on the current SVN sources of FFMPEG, MLT, MLT++ and KDEnlive by using the [http://code.google.com/p/kdenlive-dev-helpers/ kdenlive-dev-helpers] set of tools.

The &lt;tt&gt;kdenlive_builder.sh&lt;/tt&gt; tool automatically builds a full unstripped version of KDEnlive and those libraries with debug symbols and places the build in the directory named &lt;tt&gt;~/build/kdenlive_YYYY-MM-DD_HH_MM&lt;/tt&gt;.

Such a build has to be launched by the special script &lt;tt&gt;kdenlive_launcher.sh&lt;/tt&gt;. 

In order to launch such a KDEnlive build with gdb or valgrind, simply modify the &lt;tt&gt;kdenlive_launcher.sh&lt;/tt&gt; accordingly.

=== Rendering using inigo ===
The MLT command line player is inigo.

You can play or render a .westley or .kdenlive file with it. To play it:
 inigo my_playlist.westley

to render
 inigo my_playlist.westley -consumer avformat:rendered_file.mpg real_time=0 [then add ffmpeg 's avformat specific parameters]

=== Publishing a gdb trace ===
[[gdb]] is an interactive debugger allowing to execute programs step-by-step, print the value of variables and display backtrace after segfault. When using gdb, you should try to compile kdenlive from sources directly, in order to use debugging symbols. Executables provided in GNU/Linux distributions are stripped (they do not include debugging symbols). When trying to reproduce a bug, it is highly recommanded to use the latest SVN version of kdenlive.

 gdb kdenlive
After segfault, ask for a backtrace:
 bt
For more complete information, prepare a log of your session with gdb:
 script
 gdb kdenlive
Turn off pagination (everything will be available in the &lt;tt&gt;typescript&lt;/tt&gt; file afterwards, anyways):
 set pagination off
Then extract backtrace for all running threads:
 thread apply all bt
and a verbose backtrace with listing of local variables:
 where full

:Can this be any more arcane? Isn't there an easier way? One copy and paste into the terminal at the beginning of the session to get the data you need? 
Copy the output and publish a message on Kdenlive [http://www.kdenlive.org/bbforum/viewforum.php?f=16 Bug reports forum], here:

=== Publishing a valgrind trace ===
[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Valgrind Valgrind] is a valuable tool for debugging and finding memory leaks.
You may use the following options:
 valgrind --leak-check=full --freelist-vol=100000000 --log-file-exactly=log.txt -v kdenlive

Create a tar file and append the file to your message on Kdenlive [http://www.kdenlive.org/bbforum/viewforum.php?f=16 Bug reports forum]:
 tar -czf log.tar.gz log.txt

== Contacting authors ==
Kdenlive relies on MLT framework, which is the video editing engine. MLT framework relies on ffmpeg. The power of free software is to aggregate the work of thousands of developers. 
:How to contact authors in case of a problem?
=== kdenlive bug forum ===
The first step was to post a detailed message on [http://www.kdenlive.org/bbforum/viewforum.php?f=16 Kdenlive bug forum ], but
since September 2007, you should post an issue at [[http://www.kdenlive.org/mantis/  the Kdenlive bug tracker]].

=== MLT mailing list ===
If your project does not run in inigo, post a report on [https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mlt-devel MLT mailing list].

=== ffmpeg bug page ===
Ultimately, you may be interested to escalate to ffmpeg/libavformat project. ffmpeg deals with all video and audio codec and containers issues. To report a bug, visit [http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/bugreports.html ffmpeg bug report page].

== Known bugs ==
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please, start each line with an asterisk, write the Kdenlive version in bold (for example, 0.4), and then start the bug description in normal text, with a brief explanation of what it does and, if available, which workaround can be done. Please try to write all that in a single paragraph. --&gt;
*.75 - System freezes while rendering (Fedora 11)
* '''0.7''' - System freezes while rendering - see http://www.kdenlive.org/mantis/view.php?id=180
* '''0.4/0.5''' - Upgrading from previous versions causes the dialog boxes to be badly sized, and the application crashes when exiting. This is a bug in how Kdenlive manages it's configuration file. You can remove it: &lt;tt&gt;rm~/.kde/share/config/kdenliverc&lt;/tt&gt;

* '''0.5+''' - If your install cannot find its MLT source, even after you have found it in /usr/lib or whereever it may be, and it still doesn't accept it -- remove the file at /home/youruser/.kde/share/config/kdenliverc   Note this will reset any changes to the layout that you may have made; I am sure there is a better way to do this but I've not looked into it.

* '''0.5''' - Kubuntu and Ubuntu users may not be able to use some files with AAC sound, such as some MP4/M4V files.  You will need to recompile the software following the directions here [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kdenlive/Getting_and_installing] after installing the list of needed libraries, also on that same page.  Read here for more details: [http://pastebin.ca/749996]

* '''0.5''' - Kubuntu and Ubuntu (Gutsy) users may not be able to use the firewire port directly inside Kdenlive, see [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kdenlive/+bug/155480]. Just upgrade to dvgrab 3.1 will solve the problem.

== Troubleshooting ==
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: This should be a &quot;FAQ-like&quot; section. Please, write the problem/question like a 4th level section (use 4 equal signs before and after the text). Then, break the paragraph and write the &quot;answer&quot; in normal text. --&gt;

'''''Helleborus foetidus''''', known variously as '''Stinking hellebore''', '''Dungwort''', or '''Bear's foot''', is a member of the buttercup family Ranunculaceae, native to western Europe, from England south to Portugal, and east to Germany and Italy. 

==Description==
It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to 80 cm tall and 100cm across, with evergreen leaves. The flowers are yellowish-green, often with a purple edge to the five petal-like sepals on strongly upright stems. Foliage is pungent when crushed.

==Growing Conditions==
''Helleborus foetidus'' prefers woodland conditions with deep, fertile, moist, humus rich, well drained soil, and dappled shade. The species is, however, drought tolerant. 

==Varieties==
The cultivar '''Green Giant''' has very bright green flowers and finley divided foliage; '''Miss Jekyll''' has fragrant flowers, intensity varying with the time of day; '''Wester Flisk Group''' has red tinted leaves and stems and gray-green flowers; the '''Sierra Nevada Group''' is dwarf reaching 30cm.

==Uses==
It is grown in gardens for its handsome evergreen foliage and large numbers green, bell shaped flowers borne in late winter. Because of its toxicity, it is often grown where [[../Deer/]] are a problem.

==Maintenance==
This plant tends to be somewhat short-lived in the garden, but replaces itself well with copious seedlings. Deadhead to prevent reseeding, and remove the plant if it has blackened leaves or stems.

==Propagation==
Propagations is via division or from seed, which can be prolific, naturalising well in ideal conditions.

==Pests and Diseases==
(see ''[[../Helleborus/]]'' for a discussion of pests and diseases).

      <text xml:space="preserve">OpenDocument (OASIS Open Document Format for Office Application) is the native file format of OpenOffice.org. It is an Open Standard file format, meaning it is freely available and implementable without the need for paying a royalty fee. A common OpenDocument Format file is a plain XML file (E'''x'''tensible '''M'''arkup '''L'''anguage), usually contained inside a ZIP archive.

== Brief History of OpenDocument Format ==
OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) takes the base for the OpenDocument standard from OpenOffice's native file format, which originates from Sun's proprietary office suite StarOffice file format. Later OpenOffice became the first and the de facto standard for implementation of OpenDocument.

== Competing Formats ==
* Microsoft's OpenXML file format, which is largely hailed as an incompatible competitor to the OpenDocument Format. This standard is implemented on the new Microsoft Office 2007, and updates would be available to support this format on previous versions of Microsoft Office. On the most current release, OpenOffice.org does natively support Microsoft's OpenXML format.
* Microsoft's binary proprietary format, which is Microsoft Office's native file format prior to Microsoft Office 2007. OpenOffice.org could open and save to this format, however the conversion process could take some time for really large and complex files. OpenOffice.org is reported to be capable to open old files created by previous version of Microsoft Office that even the newer Microsoft Office Suites cannot.
* Microsoft Works format - OpenOffice.org can open documents in Works' format, however saving is not supported.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is taken from an interview conducted to Conan O'Brien by two children aptly named &quot;Pikku-Jaska&quot; (&quot;Little Jaska&quot;) and &quot;Pikku-Lore&quot; (&quot;Little Lore&quot;) from a Finnish TV programme called &quot;Huuma&quot;. (&quot;ecstasy&quot;)

== Text ==
This is only an excerpt, but the whole text will be available at some point.

=== Suomeksi ===

'''Poika'''

Sinun ohjelmasi tulee keskiyöllä, mutta tämä tulee parhaaseen katseuaikaan. Hermostuttaako?

'''Conan'''

Kyllä. Tämä on selvästikin erittäin iso ohjelma. Tämä on minun tilaisuuteni tehdä vaikutus moniin ihmisiin.

'''Poika'''

Onko oltava hassun näköinen vanha mies saadakseen talk shown Amerikassa?

'''Conan'''

Se auttaa. Hyvännäköisiä ihmisia ei yleensä käytetä hauskoissa ohjelmissa. Eli kyllä, olen 62-vuotias, näytän omituiselta ja se on auttanut minua paljon Amerikassa.

'''Poika'''

Olet sanonut että naiset ovat uskomattoman kauniita Suomessa. Miltä sinun vaimosi sitten näyttää?

'''Conan'''

Vaimoni on erittäin kaunis ja rakastan häntä paljon, mutta nämä Suomen naiset, voi pojat, teillä on hyvät ajat edessä.

=== Translation ===

'''Boy'''

Your programme is on at midnight, but this is on primetime. Are you nervous?

'''Conan'''

Yes. This is clearly a very big show, so this is my chance to impress a lot of people.

'''Boy'''

Do you have to be a funny looking old man to get a talk show in America?

'''Conan'''

It helps. Good looking people aren't generally used in comedy shows. But yes, I'm 62 years old, very strange looking man and it's helped me a lot in America.

'''Boy'''

You have said that women are unbelievably beautiful in Finland. What does your wife look like, then?

'''Conan'''

My wife is very beautiful and I love her very much, but these Finnish women, oh fellas, you're in for a treat!!

== Analysis ==

'''Poika'''

Sinun ohjelmasi tulee keskiyöllä, mutta tämä tulee parhaaseen katseuaikaan. Hermostuttaako?

* Keskiyöllä: Midnight, literally &quot;At middle night&quot;. Time phrases like this require the adessive case.
* Parhaaseen katseuaikaan: &quot;Into the best watching time&quot;, primetime. Illative plural on parha (Stem of paras (&quot;best&quot;)).
* Hermostuttaako: From the verb &quot;hermostuttaa&quot;, to be nervous. With a question particle on the end means &quot;are you nervous&quot;?

'''Conan'''

Kyllä. Tämä on selvästikin erittäin iso ohjelma. Tämä on minun tilaisuuteni tehdä vaikutus moniin ihmisiin.

* Selvästi: &quot;Clear&quot;. &quot;kin&quot; as a particle has two meanings, &quot;also&quot; and it can also add emphasis to a word. In this case it adds emphasis, giving &quot;selvästi&quot; an air of &quot;indeed clear&quot;.
* erittäin: Very/Particularly. A very common word.
* Tilaisuus: Chance/Opportunity. Words ending in -us have the inflectional stem ute-.
* Tehdä vaikutus: To impress. Requires the illative case, as seen in &quot;moniin ihmisiin&quot;. (nominative plural: Monet ihmiset, plural illative: Moniin ihmisiin&quot;)

'''Poika'''

Onko oltava hassun näköinen vanha mies saadakseen talk shown Amerikassa?

* Olla oltava: To have to be.
* Näköinen: Looking, e.g. Hyvännäköinen &quot;Good looking&quot;. The adjective should be in the accusative case, as seen in hassun (From &quot;hassu&quot;, funny)
* Saadakseen: in order to get, from &quot;Saada&quot;, &quot;To have/receive/get&quot;

'''Conan'''

Se auttaa. Hyvännäköisiä ihmisia ei yleensä käytetä hauskoissa ohjelmissa. Eli kyllä, olen 62-vuotias, näytän omituiselta ja se on auttanut minua paljon Amerikassa.

'''Poika'''

Olet sanonut että naiset ovat uskomattoman kauniita Suomessa. Miltä sinun vaimosi sitten näyttää?

'''Conan'''

Vaimoni on erittäin kaunis ja rakastan häntä paljon, mutta nämä Suomen naiset voi pojat, teillä on hyvät ajat edessä.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm just curious, what is that book that you're writing? Is it intended to be an annotated book, or is it something you're writing/have written? If it is something someone else wrote and is not intended to be annotated, a better place for it would probably be [[wikisource:Main page|Wikisource]]. I just wanted to tell you that before you put too much work into something here!

Thank you for your contributions, hope to continue seeing you around. Here is our welcome template, the link is there to why I changed the names of all the pages (instead of using colons to separate pages you should use slashes, that's the only real difference)!

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!

: Sounds good, if you want someone to move what you already have you mark the book with the template &lt;nowiki&gt; {{transwiki|wikisource}} &lt;/nowiki&gt; and leave a message on the [[wikibooks:Administrators' noticeboard]] that you'd like it to be moved (admins check it fairly often). Someone will get to it shortly, and it should save some work.

: Just to be sure, is this work public domain/ you have permission to publish it under a free license? Gotta stay on top of that stuff :). Let me or an admin know if you need anything else. Thanks and regards. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 22:13, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

The tissues of the body react dynamically on changes in the environment, on metabolic and mechanical stress as well as on the current internal conditions. By means of the morphologic and etiologic characteristics we can distinguish different forms of adaption.

*'''Hypertrophy''': Increase in organ size/tissue mass by increase in cell size. 
** compensating - e.g. myocardial hypertrophy in hypertonia.
** by activity - hypertrophy of the muscles in athletes.
** endocrine - e.g. through anabole steroids.
*'''Hyperplasia''': Increase in organ size/tissue mass by increase in cell count. 
** through regeneration - increase in skin thickness of the palms through hard working.
** endocrine - e.g. hyperplasia of the adrenal glands in CRH/ACTH-producing tumour.
* '''Atrophy''': Decrease in organ size/tissue mass by decrease in cell size and/or in cell count.
** Involution - normal atrophy, e.g. thymus in adults, uterus in the older woman.
** Inaktivity - e.g. in paresis.
** Aging - involution + Inaktivity, e.g.: Osteoporosis.
** Hunger - deprivation of protein and other nutrients 
** Vascular Atrophy - e.g. skin atrophy in diabetic foot or chronic arterial occlusion.
** Pressure - e.g. bone reduction near an pulsating aneurysm .
* '''Metaplasia''': e.g. Barret-Esophagus in chronic reflux, bronchial squamous epithelium metaplasia through smoking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Applications==
Gel electrophoresis is used in forensics, molecular biology, genetics, microbiology and biochemistry. 

===GE of nucleiacids===
Electrophoresis is used in DNA fingerprinting. Certain DNA segments that vary vastly among humans are cut at recognition sites by restriction endonuclease enzymes. The DNA fragments are run through electrophoresis and the distance between bands are measured and recorded as the DNA &quot;fingerprint
Electrophoresis is used for DNA sequencing.

===GE of proteins===
Used for separation, identification, and purification of proteins. SDS-PAGE is used for finding the molecular mass of protins.
SDS-PAGE is also used for protein identification and quantitation, determining purity of sample,identifying disulfide bonds,and also in blotting applications.
Native-PAGE is used to separate proteins in their native form without denaturing. QPNC-PAGE is used to isolate active or native metalloproteins in biological samples. Since 2D-PAGE separates modified proteins and staining intensity of spots roughly reflects the protein amount, it can provide information about various modified states. 2D-PAGE and DIGE are used to study differential expression of proteins.

[[Image:Gel electrophoresis apparatus.JPG|thumb|right|'''DNA electrophoresis apparatus.''']]

Gel electrophoresis is a group of techniques used by scientists to separate molecules based on physical characteristics such as size, shape, or isoelectric point as they are forced through a gel by an electrical current. Gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, but may be used as a preparative technique to partially purify molecules prior to use of other methods such as mass spectrometry, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or immuno-blotting for further characterization. (Wikipedia).It is based on the principle that,when charged molecules are placed in an electric field, they migrate toward either the positive or negative poledepending on their charge. The phosphate backbone in nucleic acids render them a consistent negative charge, so they migrate toward the anode. But proteins can have either a net positive or net negative charge.
    
== GE of Nucleic acids==
In the case of nucleic acids, the direction of migration, from negative to positive electrodes, is due to the natural negative charge due to the sugar phosphate backbone of a DNA molecule. Double-stranded DNA fragments are normally long stranded molecules, therefore their migration through the gel is relative to their size of DNA molecules and amount of bases. Single-stranded DNA or RNA tend to fold into tertiary structure due to their wearer single backbone and travel through the gel in a complicated manner. DNA can be denatured by breaking hydrogen bonds and renatured to provide easier and more accuarate results frm the gel.

==GE of Proteins==
Proteins vary on many different levels in comparison to DNA. Protein can have different charges and complex shapes, primary, secondary, teritary, and quaternary structure that make migration through the gel have extremelyt different rates when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample.Proteins are commonly separated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). PAGE can be used to purify proteins prior to other proteomics techniques or to analyze to get information on the mass, charge, or presence of a protein.SDS-PAGE is the most widely used electrophoresis technique for separates proteins.Due to these complex structures proteins are usually denatured, or broken down to simple primary structures in the presence of a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)which coats the proteins with a negative charge.This allows the protein to have an overall negative charge and allow for proper migration. The amount of SDS bound and used is relative to the size of the protein,thus this method separates proteins mainly based on mass. Two-dimensional PAGE (2-D PAGE) separates proteins by isoelectric point in the first dimension and by mass in the second dimension.Native PAGE separates proteinsby mass/charge ratio without denaturing them.


==Gel characterestics==
Electrophoreseis is usually carried out within a matrix or gel made of agarose or polyacrylamide. These gels are chemically inert, so they will interfere little with the molecules. The sample is loaded in the gel;in wells for nucleic acids separation. Agarose is a polysaccharide extracted from seaweed. Agarose gels have a large range of separation depending on the concentration.The higher the concentration the smaller the pore size will be.Polyacrylamide is a cross-linked polymer of acrylamide.To avoid inhibition of polymerization by oxygen, they are poured between glass plates to mage gel slabs.Low concentration of polyacrylamide or less cross linking results in gels with large pores. Standard protein gels are typically composed of two layers, ahe top-most layer called the stacking gel and a lower layer called separating or resolving gel.The stacking layer contains a low percentage of acylamide and low pH , while the acrylamide concentration of the separating gel varies according to the samples to be run and pH is higher.The difference in pH and acrylamide concentration at the stacking and separating gel provides better resolution and sharper bands in the separating gel.Acrylamide is a neurotoxin and therefore person handling the gel should wear gloves to avoid contact with it. The polyacrylamide gels have a high resolving power compared to agarose gels.Dependent on the substance being run, the composition, pourous nature, and percentage of gel will be varied to provide proper separation. This separation using acrylamide is normally done on proteins, DNA, RNA, oligonucleotides and other smaller molecules due to its less pourous nature. Using different concentration and compositions of aryclamide provide a thicker or thinner matrix which will separate based on size and charge. Separating larger nucleic acids is normally done with agarose gels.Again cases of concentration and composition can vary the results of the distance a substance travels on a gel.

==Separation==
The samples are loaded in the wells in the gel covered with buffer. The elctrophoresis buffer provide uniform pH and provide ions to support conductivity. When an electric current is applied, the molecules move through the matrix at different rates, towards the anode if negatively charged or towards the cathode if positively charged. (Wikipedia) The voltage as well as the time depend on the size of the gel and the type of sample. Caution must be taken to not run the samples too long or the samples may run off the gel. Caution must also be taken with the voltage, voltage too high may burn the gel or damage the samples.

==Staining==

When the gel electrophoresis has completed its run the gel is stained to allow for the bands of sample to be seen and analyzed. Stains that are normally used are Ethidium Bromide, silver, or coomassie blue dye depending on the sample. The gels are cafefully removed and placed directly into staining solution where it will sit overnight to allow for proper staining. Once fully stained bands should appear if samples were run correctly along with a molecular mass marker be placed on one or both ends of the gel to provide proper analysis.This method of protein separation and identification is useful because very little protein is needed to determine a difference in a protein. Distinct spots can be found with as little as 0.1 mg of protein when stained with Coommasie blue and even less (0.02 mg), is need when silver staining. Other methods of staining are Fluorescent dyes, and zinc or copper staining. 

==Visualization==

Visualization can be done by the naked eye as well as under a UV light to provide easier visualization.If the analyte molecules fluoresce under ultraviolet light, a photograph can be taken of the gel under ultraviolet light. If the molecules to be separated contain radioactive atoms, an autoradiogram can be recorded of the gel 

==Analysis==

Bands are then compared to those of the known molecular mass marker on the sides of the gel to determine the approximate mass of the substance as well as separate out bands. A sample that has several bands coming from a single sample can indicate an impure sample. Further analysis can be done on proteins by removing the separted sample from the gel by cutting the band out and using In-gel digestion to remove the protein from the gel for further analysis.Some drawbacks to this technique are that it is time-consuming and the purity of your protein sample will affect your results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)is a method of gel elctrophoresis to separate proteins based on the their mass.Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a detergent that breaks up the interactions between proteins. The proteins are dissolved in SDS and then electrophorised. The smallest molecules move through the gel fast, while larger molecules take longer and result in bands closer to the top of the gel.

===Procedure===
The samples are treated with SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), an anionic detergent which denatures  the protein by breaking the disulfide bonds and gives negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in folding, as differences in folding patterns would cause some proteins to better fit through the gel matrix than others. SDS  linearizes the proteins so that they may be separated strictly by molecular weight. The SDS binds to the protein in a ratio of approximately 1.4 g SDS per 1.0 g protein [[http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/protocols/html/SDS_PAGE_protocol.htm]], giving an approximately uniform mass:charge ratio for most proteins, so that the distance of migration through the gel can be assumed to be directly related to only the size of the protein.Proteins may be further treated with reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TRP(Tributyl phosphine) to break any reformed disulfide bonds and then alkalated with iodoacetamide to prevent reformation of disulfide bonds.
A tracking dye like bromophenol blue may be added to the protein solution to track the progress of the protein solution through the gel during the electrophoretic run.

[[Image:Gel_Blue_Coomassie.jpg|thumb|right|Two SDS-PAGE-gels after a completed run]]

===Gel===
The gel used for SDS-PAGE is made out of acrylamide which form crooss-linked polymers of polyacrylamide. Standard gels are typically composed of two layers, one top-most layer called the stacking gel and a lower layer called separating or resolving gel.The stacking layer contains a low percentage of acylamide and has low pH , while the acrylamide concentration of the separating gel varies according to the samples to be run and has higher pH.The difference in pH and acrylamide concentration at the stacking and separating gel provides better resolution and sharper bands in the separating gel.

===Electrophoresis===
The proteins denatured by SDS are applied to one end of a layer of polyacrylamide gel submerged in a buffer.Buffer provide uniform pH and ions for conducting electric potential. When an electric current is applied across the gel,the negatively-charged proteins migrate across the gel to the positive pole. Short proteins will more easily fit through the pores in the gel and move fast, while larger ones will have more difficulty.Due to differential migration based on their size, smaller proteins move farther down the gel, while larger ones stay closer to the point of origin.After a given period of time,proteins might have separated roughly according to their sizes.Proteins of known molecular weight (marker proteins)can be run in a separate lane in the gel to calibrate the gel.

===Staining and analysis===

Following electrophoresis, the gel may be stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain to visualize the separated proteins.After staining, different proteins will appear as distinct bands within the gel accroding to their sizes(and therefore by molecular weights). The molecular weight of a protein in the band can be estimated by comparing it with the marker proteins of known molecular weights.The separatesd protens can be cut from the gel and further analyzed by other proteomics techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve">2D-PAGE is a form of gel electrophoresis  in which separation and identification of proteins in a sample are done by displacement in 2 dimensions oriented at right angles to one another(orthogonal). This technique is also used to compare two or more samples to find differences in their protein expressions.

===Basis for separation===

In this technique proteins are separated by two different physicochemical properties. In the first dimension proteins or polypeptides are separated on the basis of their net charges by isoelectric focusing and in the second dimension they are separated on the basis of their molecular masses by electrophoresis. Because it is unlikely that two molecules will be similar in both properties, molecules are more effectively separated in 2-D electrophoresis than in 1-D electrophoresis.

===Sample preparation===

The goal of sample preparation is to solubilize maximum number of proteins and maintain their solubility throughout the process. The materials for sample should be carefully collected, snap frozen and ground under liquid nitrogen in the presence of protease inhibitors. After extracting proteins from source material they are then solubilized and denatured by means of chaotropes, detergents, and reducing agents. Hydrogen-bonds in the sample proteins are disrupted by chaotropes urea and thiourea. Uncharged detergents are used to disrupt hydrophobic interactions. Detergents such as CHAPS, Triton X-100, sulfobetaine SB3-10, and amidosulfobetaine  are IEF-compatible additives. Disulfide bonds 
are reduced to sulfhydryls by reducing agents dithiothrietol (DTT), dithioerythritol, and tributyl phosphine (TBP). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sequential extraction is done to categorize proteins based on their solubility. This is an example of pre-fractionation to enrich low abundance proteins. Proteins are sequentially extracted into chaotrope/detergent solutions of increasing solubilization power. First, proteins are treated with an aqueous buffer, the insoluble proteins remaining from this extraction are treated with urea/CHAPS/TBP, and the insoluble proteins remaining from this step are then treated with urea/thiourea/CHAPS/SB 3-10/TBP.  2-D PAGE is then done to separate the proteins in each of the supernatants. The remaining insoluble material from the final extraction can be taken up in SDS-PAGE sample solution and run in a one-dimensional gel.

===Isoelectric focusing (IEF)===
In IEF, proteins are separated by electrophoresis in a pH gradient based on their isoelectric point(pl). A pH gradient is generated in the gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel. At all pHs other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged. If they are positively charged, they will move towards the more negative end of the gel and if they are negatively charged they will move towards the more positive end of the gel. At its isoelectric point, since the protein molecule carry no net charge it accumulates or focuses into a sharp band.

=====Immobilized pH Gradeint (IPG) and IEF run=====
Immobilized pH gradients are used for IEF because the fixed pH gradients remain stable over extended run times at very high voltages. The pH gradients of IPGs are generated by means of buffering compounds that are covalently bound into polyacrylamide gels. IPGs are cast strips with plastic backing sheets and are commercially available in different pH ranges and lengths. They offer high resolution, great reproducibility, and allow high protein loads. Isoelectric focusing is run in the same solutions that are used to extract or solubalize the proteins. The IPG strips with the protein sample must be rehydrated in the rehydration/sample buffer during with protein samples are loaded into the strips. Rehydration can be active or passive. To load larger proteins active rehydration in small voltage is applied. After the run in IEF cell, the proteins focus as bands on the strip according to their isoelectric points. The focused strips can be frozen for storage

===SDS-PAGE===
=====IPG gel strips equilibration=====
The proteins in the focussed IPG strips are uncharged because they are at their pI and so they will not move into the SDS- PAGE gel. So the strips are treated with SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), an anionic detergent which denatures  the protein by breaking the disulfide bonds and gives negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in folding, as differences in folding patterns would cause some proteins to better fit through the gel matrix than others. SDS  linearizes the proteins so that they may be separated strictly by molecular weight. The SDS binds to the protein in a ratio of approximately 1.4 g SDS per 1.0 g protein (although binding ratios can vary from 1.1-2.2 g SDS/g protein), giving an approximately uniform mass:charge ratio for most proteins, so that the distance of migration through the gel can be assumed to be directly related to only the size of the protein. 
Proteins may be further treated with reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TRP(Tributyl phosphine to break any reformed disulfide bonds and then alkalated with iodoacetamide to prevent reformation of disulfide bonds. A tracking dye like bromophenol blue may be added to the protein solution to track the progress of the protein solution through the gel during the electrophoretic run.

=====SDS-PAGE run=====
The equlibrated IPG strip is placed on the top of the SDS-PAGE gel  submerged in a suitable buffer and sealed in place with agarose gel. An electric current is applied across the gel, causing the negatively-charged proteins move out of the gel and migrate across the gel. Depending on their size, each protein  move differently through the gel matrix. Smaller proteins travel farther down the gel, while larger ones remain closer to the point of origin. The proteins separate roughly according to size and therefore by molecular weight. It is common to run &quot;marker proteins&quot; of known molecular weight in a separate lane in the gel, in order to calibrate the gel and determine the weight of unknown proteins by comparing the distance traveled relative to the marker.

===Visualization===
After electrophoresis the gel is stained to visualize the separated proteins. Commonly used stains are Coomassie Brilliant Blue or SYPRO Ruby or silver stain. different proteins will appear as distinct spot within the gel. Coomassie Brilliant Blue or SYPRO Buby are compatible with Mass Spectrometry. Coomassie Brilliant Blue has detection limit about 10ng of proteins per spot and the gel images of spots can be captured by scanning densitometer which operate in visible light[[http://www.weihenstephan.de/blm/deg/manual/manualwork2html02test.htm]]. SYPRO Ruby can detect 1ng of proteins per spot and since it is fluorescent , the sopts are visualized by a fluorescent imager. Silver stain can detect spots containing proteins less than 1 ng and is the most sensitive non – radioactive protein visualization method.Laser devices for image capturing are useful for fluorescently stained gels.
[[Image:2D-PAGE.JPG|frame|Image of the gel after 2D-PAGE run]]

===Analysis===
The images can be further analyzed using image –analysis softwares. These softwares quantify proteins spots, match images and compare corresponding spots intensites of related gels, prepare gel data reports, remove background patterns, and integrate image information to databases.Alternately the proteins separated can be obtained from the gel can be analyzed by MS for protein identification. 2D- PAGE can be used to study diffrential protein expression by comparing images from  2D –PAGE gels samples labeled with stable isotopes or fluorescent dyes.

===Advantages and Disadvantages===
Using 2D-PAGE,100 –1000’s of polypeptides can be analyzed in a single run. The proteins can be separated in pure form the spots. The spots can be quantified and also analyzed by MS. In this method polypeptides can be probed with antibodies and also 
they can be tested for post- trnslational modifications. The disadvantages may include large amount of sample handling, less reproducibility, difficulty to separate low abundance proteins, acidic and basic proteins, very large and very small proteins and hydrophobic proteins.Also not automated for high throughput analysis.2D-PAGE has limited dynamic range.

Unless otherwise stated, the audio effects used in Kdenlive are based on [http://plugin.org.uk/ LADSPA], an open-source architecture for sound plug-ins. They will be available '''only''' if MLT was compiled with support for LADSPA, and for achieving this the packages ''ladspa-sdk'' and ''libjack-dev'' and ''swh-plugins'' must be installed. However, this should not be an issue for people not interested in compiling Kdenlive locally.

=Mute=
Hides the audio from a clip. This is a MLT effect.

=Volume=
Adjust the variation of audio volume in a clip between two selected frames. This effect is provided by the MLT framework.

=Declipper=
Remove from the soundtrack clicks caused by ''clipping'', an artifact caused when the audio recording level was too high. If you can have a graphical visualization of the sound, in a software like Audacity, you will see the audio &quot;overflowing&quot; and having its peaks cut off --- and these peaks cause the clip artifact.

=Vinyl=
Emulate the sound of a vinyl record player.

=Limiter=
Limit the audio volume.

=Equalizer=
A stereo equalizer, useful for adjusting playback levels separately for different tones, like treble, mid and bass.

=Phaser=
Very commonly used by guitar players, this effect causes an inversion in the phase of a sound wave in regular periods of time. In a sound wave made from a constant tone, a phaser will make it sound like a &quot;woouunnwooouunn...&quot;. Well, it is surely easier to understand it by hearing than by reading :)

=Pitch Scaler=
Allows you to modify the tone modulation of a sound --- for example, to make a male voice sound like a female voice and vice-versa.

=Pitch Shifter=

=Rate Scaler=

=Reverb=
Reverberation is what happens, for example, when you sing in a cathedral, by the sound reflecting in the walls.

=Room Reverb=
Same effect as in ''reverb'' but with shorter delays, like in a bathroom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Kdenlive, a project is made of ''clips''. These can be whole audio or video files, or segments of files you add to the project.

=Adding clips to the project=
If you drag a file onto the timeline that is not in the project (for instance, if you drag a DV file straight from Konqueror to Kdenlive), then the file will be automatically added to the project for you.

You can add clips to the Project List yourself. Either use the Project List context menu (right click on the window), or the '''Project''' menu on the menu bar. Select 'Add Clips' to bring up a file dialog in which you can select the clip you wish to add to this project. As long as the clips are valid, they will appear in the Project List.

=Deleting clips via the Project List=
You can delete clips from your project by selecting 'Delete Clip' via the clip context menu (right click) or from the '''Project''' menu.  When you delete a clip from the Project List, this will also remove any clips on the timeline that are using it.

=Clip Properties=


=Clean Project - removing unused clips=
Use '''Clean Project''' to remove any clips from your project that are currently unused. This is great if your Project List has become cluttered and you want to get a concise view of which clips exist. Cleaning a project will not alter your final edit in any way --- the only clips that are removed are those that are no longer in use anywhere.

      <comment>/* Composite */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Transitions''' are probably one of the most interesting features of non-linear video edition. They are used between two clips and they allow a soft, or a sophisticated way of passing from one scene to the other. This is a contrast with the &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;dry&quot; cut between scenes -- which, prior to the computer adoption, were very hard to make or required special equipment.

For using a transition effect in Kdenlive, you must place the two clips you want to join in different video tracks, in such a way that they &quot;overlap&quot; each other a little bit --- exactly in the points you want to place the transition. Then, right-click the mouse over the first clip (the &quot;outgoing&quot; one), then select '''Add transition''' in the context menu, and point the mouse towards the arrow for seeing the transition types available. Then you will see a yellow rectangle placed between the video tracks, representing the transition. For having a live preview of how the transition will look like, simply drag the timeline cursor from left to right over the transition area.

You can modify the transition effect, or the way it works, by left-clicking the mouse twice over this yellow rectangle. This will turn it into red and cause the &quot;Transition&quot; tab in the top-left panel to pop and show the properties you can set for the currently selected transition effect --- and, if you want, you can choose another type of transition, clicking at the icons at the left of this panel. We will call this operation as &quot;entering in edit mode&quot; for the transition.

Generally the top strip displays on the project (lower strip number). Default transition order is &lt;!-- erm, i mean, seems to be --&gt; from down to up, so for a crossfade from clip1 to clip2 first should be on strip#1 and second is on strip#0. (Reverse order can be handlead easily by using &quot;reverse&quot; checkbox in the effects.)

== AffineComposite ==
AffineComposite composes upper and lower strips, using lower as background and upper as &quot;picture in picture&quot;. 

You apply rotation, shear and mirror effects to the upper (usually smaller) clip. 

You can set the size and the position of the upper clip by moving the red rectangle in the bottom positional area of the settings of the effect. (It's pretty buggy as of 0.7, you have to select effect, draw the ''invisible'' position, deselect, select again, and it shows.)

== Composite ==
Simple picture-in-picture effect, uses upper clip as background and lower as picture-in-picture.

== Luma ==
[[File:Luma.png|thumb|400px|Luma effect in action]]
This transition goes from one video to another using effect defined by an image file (&quot;luma&quot; file). The lighter an area of luma file is, the sooner following clip will appear in this area.

Luma transforms from lower clip to upper one.

You can download some luma files using &quot;Settings&quot; -&gt; &quot;Download new lumas&quot; in pull-down menu.

Parameters:
* Softness: enables control over how soft the transition looks 
* Invert: inverts the luma file, therefore making black areas appear first
* ImageFile: The luma file
* Reverse transition: transition goes from upper strip to lower one

== Wipe ==
Classic slide-in effect. Start and end parameters give where the upper strip starts from and ends up. Starting and ending transparency gives a possibiity to crossfade apart from sliding. 

(Plain crossfade can be simulated by having both start and end in the middle, and start from 100% transparent to end at 0%.)

Align parameter aligns the ...

== Comments ==
At the time of version 0.7, Kdenlive provides four major kinds of transitions: AffineComposite, Composite, Luma, and Wipe.  Unfortunately these are not documented yet, but it has been suggested on IRC (#kdenlive, FreeNode) that crossfade is achievable using the Composite transition.  Please also see the [http://www.kdenlive.org/forum/users-forums/video-effects-and-transitions Video Effects and Transitions section] of the forums.

== Version 0.5 ==
At the time of version 0.5, Kdenlive provided four major kinds of transitions, documentation for which is kept below for posterity until more uptodate documentation can replace it:

=== Crossfade ===
This is the most known and used transition effect. Two scenes are softly blended: the first scene gradually starts to fade out with transparency while the second scene fades in over it until it completely replaces the first. The time of the overlap and thus the speed of the cross-fade can easily be adjusted. 

This effect can also be used for the widely known '''fade-in''' and '''fade-out''' effects. For creating the fade in/out, assuming you simply want you to use the standard &quot;fade to/from black&quot;, you can simply go to edit mode and, at the top-left panel, click in the combobox ''Perform transition with:'' and choose &quot;Background track (black)&quot;. Alternativel, you can fade to white or any other color by first creating a [[color clip]] with any desired color and use it as the first or second scene of the transition.

=== Push ===
This transition does not blend the clips --- instead, the &quot;outgoing&quot; clip is &quot;pushed out&quot; of the screen by the incoming clip.

In the edit mode for the ''Push'' transition, you must use the ''Start'' and ''End'' radiobuttons to define, respectively, where the first scene will be &quot;positioned&quot; in the screen during the transition --- in other words, you set the push direction. For that, just click in the rectangles of the 3x3 matrix shown. Usually you will click in the central rectangle for &quot;Start&quot;; you will certainly see no transition effect if you choose another start position.

The Transparency control allows you to set, well, transparency to the clip which is going out of the screen. It is applied also according to the &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;End&quot; buttons. You will normally want the outgoing clip to vanish during the movement, so you will set 0 or a low value for transparency at &quot;Start&quot;, and a higher value at &quot;End&quot;.

Anyway, you might want the second clip to &quot;come into the screen&quot; --- so you can use the &quot;Invert direction&quot; checkbutton, and use suitably inverted values and directions for &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;End&quot;. Play around with the options until you get the desired effect.

=== PIP ===
PIP stands for '''Picture in picture''', and this transition effect causes the impression that the second clip is growing from a point, or the first clip is shrinking to a certain point. 

=== Wipe ===
Makes the scene from the first clip to be &quot;wiped&quot; from the screen in an animated way, giving room for the second clip.

==== Creating and using Luma files ====
The Wipe transitions are based in '''Luma files''' --- grayscale images in which the white-to-black variation &quot;drives the wipe&quot; for a transition. You can either create your own Luma files or download them from the internet.

      <comment>/* The Timeline */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Kdenlive has, with no doubt, one of the simplest interfaces you can find in video editing softwares. It is a typical multitrack editor, with a portion of the main window being used for showing the files used in the project, a timeline made of multiple audio and video tracks where you put those files or clips made from them; another portion of the window with a pair of video monitors to allow you to watch those files and also the contents of the timeline; plus the usual menus which you see in lots of other applications.

=The Project Area=

==Effect List==
==Project Tree==
==Transition==
==The Effects Stack==
The Effects Stack shows which effects were applied to the selected clip in the Timeline. From there, you can edit the settings of an effect; and if you don´t want one of the effects to be applied, you can simply remove it from the stack.

=The Timeline=
==The Timeline==
Kdenlive allows visual and audio tracks to be layered separately or grouped together in the timeline: the highest video clip in the timeline  obscures whatever is below it when played back in the project monitor. Audio tracks mix together.&lt;br&gt;
Files can be dragged in their entirety from the project tree straight onto the time line or select portions from the Clip Monitor using Set Zone In and Set Zone Out buttons (mark in and mark out)

=The Monitors=
The monitors are those little rectangular black boxes which play video or audio in your project. They are divided in notebook tabs, but you probably will not have to deal with those tabs --- the appropriate monitor is automatically selected according to what you are doing at the moment.

All the monitors are equiped with playback controls --- those &quot;Play&quot;, &quot;Rewind&quot;, &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, &quot;Pause&quot; and other buttons you have already seen in most media players. Those buttons have some &quot;hidden&quot; functionalities --- for example, the Rewind and Fast Forward buttons may be pressed more than once for reversing or forwarding the video/audio in different speeds.

You can use the mousewheel to move back and forward in the monitors, one frame at a time. Pressing Ctrl while using the wheel changes it to move one second at a time.

==The Clip Monitor==

==The Project Monitor==
This monitor shows the video that is the result of the current Timeline. It works in a similar way to the Clip Monitor.

Inpoints and outpoints on the Timeline Monitor achieve the same purpose as they do on the Clip Monitor. You can choose a part of the current timeline, and drag a clip of it back to the timeline. You will get a &quot;project clip&quot;, which is a clip that contains all of the clips on the timeline in the state when you made it. It is useful for grouping together a number of clips when you have finished editing them and want to be able to treat them as a single clip.

==The Capture Monitor==
This monitor shows video from a DV device connected to your computer. You can find more details on it in the [[Kdenlive/Capture|Capture]] page.

=Changing the interface layout=
Kdenlive allows you to change the position of the various areas you see in the main window. Four stock combinations are provided, but you can modify them freely or create a new, unique combination.

For using the provided layouts, you can simply click on those '''1, 2, 3, 4''' buttons you see in the main window toolbar.

      <comment>/* Exporting to a video file */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">When you have finished editing, you can '''render''' your project via the '''Render-&gt;Export Timeline''' menu. This brings up a dialog, which allows you to choose your export format, export options, and filename to save as.

=Export Profiles=
When you click the '''File-&gt;Export Timeline''' menu item, a dialog will show you a list of possible [[Kdenlive/Video codecs|formats]] and parameters which you can choose for the video file to be created. The items on this list are the '''export profiles'''. The stock profiles offered by Kdenlive are some of the most common ones, but you can create a profile of your own if you need a video with special properties, such as a certain screen size or [[Kdenlive/Video codecs|video codec]] tag.

Be aware that this process can take a very long time (perhaps a few hours for a full DVD image of 4 GB)

==Creating your own export profiles==

=== MLT libavcodec parameters list ===

=Exporting to a video file=
#Create your project
#Add a video clip
#Add the video clip to the video track - edit, add transitions ...
#Click on RENDER button. A new window pop up (Rendering).
 Select Destination: File Rendering
 Output File Name: give a name
 Format: select what kind of video format you need (NTSC, HD...)
then hit &quot;Render to file&quot; button located at left bottom corner of the current window.

Will open the &quot;Job Queue&quot; tab where you can see the progress.&lt;br&gt;
When is finished click on &quot;Close&quot;.

=Exporting to DVD=
The DVD wizard offered by Kdenlive allows you to automatically create [[Kdenlive/Video codecs|VOB files]] which can be recorded to a DVD, along with the chapters definition and a simple menu.

Be aware that this process can take a very long time (perhaps a few hours for a full DVD image of 4 GB)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Radiation_Oncology/Cervix/TOC}}


==Overview==
*No curative surgical options
*Primary RT alone fails often (Stage IIB ~20-50%, Stage III 50-75%)
*Early trials showed no difference, but RTOG 90-01 showed a benefit for CRT. Also, several other trials in other subgroups showed a benefit.  
*As a result, in 1999 NCI recommended that &quot;strong consideration should be given to adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy in the treatment of invasive cervical cancer&quot;
*Cisplatin-based regimens appear best, but no firm conclusions yet

==RT vs. Chemo-RT==
===Meta-Analysis===
*'''Lanzhou University, China; 2010''' PMID 20157716 -- &quot;Radiochemotherapy versus radiotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer: a meta-analysis.&quot; (Wang N, Arch Gynecol Obstet. 2010 Feb 16. [Epub ahead of print])
**Meta-analysis. 18 RCT involving 3,517 patients, locally advanced cervical CA. Comparison of RT vs chemo-RT
**Outcome: chemo-RT superior in response rate, 3-year OS and 5-year OS
**Toxicity: Chemo-Rt worse in GI, myelosuppression and leucopnia.  No significant difference in rectitis, cystitis, nausea, or vomiting
**Conclusion: Chemo-RT superior outcome, no significant difference in toxicity

===Randomized Evidence===
*'''NCI Canada, 2002''' PMID 11844818 -- &quot;Phase III trial comparing radical radiotherapy with and without cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced squamous cell cancer of the cervix.&quot; (Pearcey R, J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb 15;20(4):966-72.)
**Randomized. 259 patients with Stage IB-IVA squamous cell Cx, bulky &gt;5cm or pathologically LN+. Treated with RT +/- cisplatin 40mg/m2 qw. Median F/U 6.8 years
**5-year outcomes: no difference in PFS, or OS (62% vs. 58%)
**Conclusion: No difference, however balance of other evidence suggests CRT
**Editorial (PMID 11844807): No surgical staging of PA LN, anemia imbalance. Agree with authors conclusion that balance of evidence suggests combined-modality treatment

*'''Taiwan, 1997''' (1990-1995) PMID 9234921 -- &quot;A randomized trial of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy in advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix.&quot; (Tseng CJ, Gynecol Oncol. 1997 Jul;66(1):52-8.)
**Randomized. 122 patients with advanced Cx. Treated with RT alone vs. RT + concurrent chemo (cisplatin, vincristine, bleomycin q3w x4 cycles). Median F/U 3.8 years
**3-year outcomes: DFS: 52% vs. 53% (NS), OS 62% vs. 64% (NS)
**Toxicity: higher in concurrent group 37% vs. 18% (SS)
**Conclusion: no difference

*'''RTOG 90-01''' (1990-97)
**403 pts. Stage IIB-IVA, or Stage IB-IIA with &gt;5cm tumor, or LN+.  Randomized to: 1) 45 Gy to pelvis + paraaortic nodes (both at 1.8 Gy/fx) with upper border at L1/L2, or 2) 45 Gy to pelvis alone plus 3 cycles 5-FU and cisplatin concurrent with RT.  Intracavitary RT given in both arms. Chemotherapy was cisplatin (75 mg/m2) on Day 1 and 5-FU (4 g/m2 96-hr infusion,Days 1-5), repeated q3w.
**'''3-years, 1999''' PMID 10202164 &amp;mdash; &quot;Pelvic radiation with concurrent chemotherapy compared with pelvic and para-aortic radiation for high-risk cervical cancer.&quot; Morris M et al. N Engl J Med. 1999 Apr 15;340(15):1137-43. Median F/U 3.6 years. 
***Estimated 5-year outcome: DFS RT alone 40% vs CRT 67% (SS); OS 58% vs 73% (SS). Decreased DM and LRR in chemo+RT arm. 
***Toxicity: comparable, higher reversible hematologic in CRT
***Conclusion: Significantly improved survival with concurrent cisplatin/5-FU

**Retrospective. 91 patients IIIB/IVA treated with curative intent. Median F/U 8.8 years
**Outcome: 10-year LC 53%, RFS 26%, OS 21%; 5-year LC 53%, RFS 30%, OS 29%

**27 pts; 22 Stage IIIB, 5 IVA. Treated with RT (median dose 50 Gy) + 5-FU. Only 4 pts received brachytherapy.
**Median f/u 190 mo (&gt;15 yrs) --  5-yr OS 37%; 41% for IIIB. 4 of 10 pts who received chemo + only 50 Gy were long term survivors.
**Conclusion: &quot;While this series is small, the fact that 4 patients with massive Stage IIIB tumors survived after a total radiation dose of only 50 Gy suggests that RT with CI IA 5-FU deserves further study. Modifications in dose, technique, and route of administration should reduce toxicity, and the addition of intracavitary RT should improve the local effectiveness of combined treatment.&quot;

**47 pts. Stage IIIB. 
**13 (28%) were lymph node negative by PET, 20 (43%) had (+) pelvic LN only, 7 (15%) had both pelvic and para-aortic LN, 7 (15%) had pelvic, PA, and supraclavicular LNs. None had other distant mets.
**3-yr CSS 73% (LN-), 58% (pelvic LN), 29% (pelvic + PA), 0% (SCLV).
**Conclusion: &quot;The cause-specific survival for patients with FIGO Stage IIIb carcinoma is highly dependent on the extent of lymph node metastasis as demonstrated by whole-body FDG-PET.&quot;

* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Digital video has some properties and terminology inherited from old analog systems used in television broadcast and also some new properties brought by the new technologies. Detailed information about those properties and systems are beyond the scope of this manual, but here are some explanations which might help you in using clips and generating video with Kdenlive.

=Frames per second=
The human eye is a wonderful mechanism, but it can be fooled. This is what made cinema possible back in the 1800s --- if a sequence of slightly different still pictures is shown rapidly, the eye cannot distinguish individual images, creating the illusion of movement. The same thing happens if you take a pen between your fingers and move it up and down while keeping your fingers flexible --- this will make the pen look as if it's melted.

In video language, each of the pictures in a sequence is called a '''frame''', and we have to show the frames at a certain speed to create the movement illusion. The measure found for this speed is the number of '''frames per second (fps)'''. The human eye can not distinguish frames shown at a rate of 14fps, although this might still look clumsy. This was the speed used in the earlier cinema movies. Slightly higher speeds allow an illusion of smoother movement.

When television was created, one of the problems found was that, more than having the frames shown at a certain rate, it was needed to synchronise the frame display in the receiver to that of the transmitter. The lack of precise electronic circuits and components at the time led the engineers to use a simple oscilator which was ready for use in the wall --- the frequency of the Alternating  Current (AC) electricity network. In some countries, AC was generated in a 50Hz frequency, and in other countries it came to the outlets at 60Hz. This will have more meaning when we reach the NTSC and PAL systems explanations.

=Screen size=

=Aspect Ratio=

The '''aspect ratio''' is basically the proportion between the screen width and the screen height.

The two more used aspect ratios are:

* '''4:3''' - This is the standard format for analog television, also known as &quot;pan format&quot;.
* '''16:9''' - This format comes from cinema, and it is also used by the so-called ''wide-screen'' television.

When a 16:9 movie must be shown in a 4:3 screen, it has to be cut at both sides, by removing columns (and content), or it can be shown with black borders in the top and bottom which will allow the whole width to fit in the narrower screen. This latter display method is known as '''letterbox'''.

=Video interlacing=
Another property which came from the television. The cinescopes (or CRTs, Cathode Ray-Tubes) used until the 90s did not have enough speed to write a whole picture in the screen 50 or 60 times in a second.

The solution found was to split each picture in two '''fields''' --- the first one made of all the odd lines which composed a picture, and the second one with the even lines. The human eye could not distinguish scenes shown and the materials used in the tube screens would, anyways, retain light for a little while after the light ray hit them. In such speed, the combination of the two fields would be imperceptible.

This is '''interlacing'''. Following the frequency chosen by the television engineers, 50 or 60 fields are shown per second, making for, respectively, 25 or 30 frames per second.

Later, faster cinescopes allowed the full display of pictures without the need of interlacing, and '''non-interlaced video''' allows a better quality, specially noticeable in frozen images. Sometimes, converting interlaced video to non-interlaced video or vice-versa is desirable.

=Timecode=
When we are editing video, we often need a reference of a specific point of the video --- for example, where a certain scene begins. The most precise measure since the earlier edition machines is the '''timecode''', which came with the magnetic video tape technology and remained in digital video.

The timecode of a recording is embedded in the video information and it counts the time since the start of the recording. It is usually shown in the format hh:mm:ss:ff, where ''hh'' is the number of hours, ''mm'' means minutes, ''ss'' are the seconds, and ''ff'' is the number of frames within a second.

=NTSC=
[http://en.wikipedia.org/NTSC NTSC] is a television broadcast system created by the National Television Standards Committee in USA. While an analog system, NTSC is used as a reference for digital video for the screen size and number of frames per second. It has the following characteristics:

* 352x240 pixels screen size (720x480 for DVD)
* 30fps. More precisely, 30000/1001fps or 29,97fps.

The strange rate of frames per second in NTSC makes necessary the use of the commonlly called '''drop frame''' technique in video editors like Kdenlive. Every 2 minutes, except each 10th minute, two frames are simply ignored in the time count, so the video seems to run in 30fps. Without this trick, the audio at &quot;real 30fps&quot; would slightly slip out of sync with the video in some minutes.

=PAL=
The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL PAL] system was created by German electronics giant AEG-Telefunken and became widely adopted in many other countries of Europe, South America, Asia and Africa. Its name comes from ''Phase-Alternate Line'', which was a rather ingenious method found by the engineers to allow automatic color correction in television --- which resulted in PAL being described as &quot;Pictures Always Loveable&quot;, while NTSC was known as &quot;Never Twice the Same Color&quot;...

Just like NTSC, PAL is also used as a reference in digital video for image size and picture rate:

* 352x288 pixels screen size (720x576 for DVD)
* 25fps

However, a number of PAL variants were created for different countries and some of them do NOT follow these standards. The PAL-M system adopted in Brazil and Laos, for example, keeps the &quot;color burst&quot; and modulation of PAL while taking the picture size and frames-per-second properties of NTSC.

=Chrominance and Luminance: colors in video=
When color TV became commercially possible, a number of black and white TV sets were already in people´s restrooms and it would make no sense to throw them away. Also, the idea of transmitting color TV with different signals for the three basic colors (Red, Green and Blue, the famous RGB) was impossible in practice, because of the large bandwidth required for analog transmission. It would be too much information to fit in one standard television channel, 6MHz wide.

Engineers got a brilliant solution, one more time benefiting from a limitation of the human eye. They created a color system based on '''subtraction''' which became known as YCC, as opposite to the addition system used for RGB.

The main part of the analog color TV signal is made of '''luminance''', which defines only the brightness, ranging from full black to full white. This is exactly what the black and white TV needed, so those old TV sets could remain useful just by ignoring the color information. Added to it, but taking much less bandwidth, the '''chrominance''' signals were added for the colors. These signals are processed locally by the receiver with a little colors logic. If the blend of all colors in full bright result in pure white --- which is also the maximum value possible for the luminance signal ---, you could get color values from subtracting those chrominance values from the luminance signal.

To be exact, the blend for making white is 30% red, 11% blue and 60% green. So, to keep the required bandwidth as low as possible, the two chrominance signals blended to the luminance are those for red (C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) and blue (C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;). Getting the amount of green in a pixel is as simple as G = Y - C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; . Blue is the result of Y + (C&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; - Y), and red comes from Y + (C&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; - Y).

Then, a coloured image in TV is made half by the luminance signal, and the rest for chrominance (a proportion of 4:2:2). The color information itself can use less bandwidth because the human eye is much more sensitive to the bright and contours of an image than the color differences. You can prove that by looking at drawings made only from colors without black or darker contours. 

Although this solution was made for analog television, and digital video allows complete color information in a narrower bandwidth, the YCC scheme was preserved for allowing better compression. The DV25 standard for digital video uses even less bandwidth for the color information, in a luminance/chrominance proportion of 4:1:1 --- which can lead to visual artifacts in operations such as compositing an image with other of a person shot against a blue background (the famous ''chromakey'' composition). The more professional-driven DV50 standard uses 4:2:2 color sampling by default.

'''''Vinca''''' is a genus of five species of in the family [[../Apocynaceae/]], native to Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Asia. The common name, shared with the related genus ''[[../Catharanthus/]]'', is '''Periwinkle'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mehta&quot;&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2012/01/pharmacognosy-of-vinca-alkaloids-periwinkle/ Pharmacognosy of Vinca (Periwinkle)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
They are trailing vines, subshrubs or herbaceous, and have slender trailing stems 1-2 m &lt;ref&gt;3-6 feet&lt;/ref&gt; long but not growing more than 20-70 cm &lt;ref&gt;8-30 inches&lt;/ref&gt; above ground; the stems frequently take root where they touch the ground, enabling the plant to spread widely. The leaves are opposite, simple broad lanceolate to ovate, 1-9 cm &lt;ref&gt;1/4-3.5 inches&lt;/ref&gt; long and 0.5-6 cm &lt;ref&gt;1/4-2.25 inches&lt;/ref&gt; broad; they are evergreen in four species, but deciduous in the herbaceous ''[[../Vinca herbacea|V. herbacea]]'', which dies back to the root system in winter. 

The flowers, produced through most of the year, are salverform (like those of ''[[../Phlox/]]''), simple, 2.5-7 cm &lt;ref&gt;1-3 inches&lt;/ref&gt; broad, with five usually violet (occasionally white) petals joined together at the base to form a tube. The fruit consists of a group of divergent follicles; a dry fruit which is dehiscent along one rupture site in order to release seeds.

==Species==
The two most commonly grown species are ''[[../Vinca major/]]'' and ''[[../Vinca minor/]]''

==Uses==
Two species, the Small Periwinkle ''[[../Vinca minor|V. minor]]'' and the Large Periwinkle ''[[../Vinca major|V. major]]'', are very popular ornamental plants in gardens, grown for dense evergreen ground cover and their delicate violet flowers. ''V. major'' has broader leaves with a hairy margin and larger flowers, is less cold hardy, and has twice as many chromosomes as ''V. minor''. A variegated selection of ''V. major'' is commonly cultivated. Both species are considered invasive weeds in parts of the United States and Australia. They do not respond to common herbicides and require hormone based sprays to control.

This plant was formerly used in homeopathy for [[w:catarrh|catarrh]] and [[w:dyspepsia|dyspepsia]] but due to the nature and effects of the alkaloids vincamine, isovincamine and vincamidine, it is rarely used. The chemotherapy drugs vincristine and vinblastine are derived from this plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;mehta&quot;/&gt;

==Maintenance==
Remove any leaf cover in the fall to prevent fungal problems.

==Propagation==
Propagated by cuttings.

'''Wilting''' refers to the loss of rigidity of non-woody parts of plants. This occurs when the turgor pressure in non-woody plant cells falls towards zero, as a result of diminished water in the cells. Lower water availability may result from:
* [[../Drought|drought conditions]], where the soil moisture drops below conditions most favorable for plant functioning; 
* high salinity, which causes water to diffuse from the plant cells and induce shrinkage;
* saturated soil conditions, where roots are unable to obtain sufficient oxygen for cellular respiration, and so are unable to transport water into the plant; or
* bacteria, fungi, or other microorganisms that clog the plant's vascular system.

Wilting diminishes the plant's ability to transpire and grow. Permanent wilting leads to plant death. Symptoms of wilting and [[../Blights|blights]] resemble one another.

In woody plants, reduced water availability leads to cavitation of the xylem.</text>

'''''Phlox''''' (pronounced &quot;flocks&quot;) is a genus of 67 species of annual or perennial flowering plants. Some species flower in early spring while others flower in summer into fall. Most species are native to temperate North America but a few species are also from northeastern Asia.  They are found growing in diverse habitats from alpine locations to open woodlands and prairies.

==Description==
Phlox range in color from pale blue to bright red to white, though cultivars have been bred for purple and deep blue. Some species such as ''[[../Phlox glaberrima/]]'' (Smooth Phlox) grow to 1.5 m tall, while others, such as ''[[../Phlox stolonifera/]]'' (Creeping Phlox), form low mats only a few centimeters in height. Seeds are in a 3-celled, valved capsule, with one seed to each cell.

The flowers are 5-lobed, with a tube below the lobes. The flower buds open by untwisting.

==Growing conditions==
Phlox is best grown in fertile, well-drained soil, exposed to partial shade to partial sun.

==Uses==
Phloxes are grown for their showy, often fragrant flowers in borders and cutting gardens. They attract both butterflies and hummingbirds.

==Maintenance==
Deadheading and staking are often needed for taller species.

==Propagation==
Division, cuttings, or seed.

The foliage of ''Phlox'' is sometimes eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Dot Moth, ''[[w:Gazoryctra|Gazoryctra wielgusi]]'', [[w:Hummingbird Hawk-moth]] and ''[[w:Schinia|Schinia indiana]]'' which feeds exclusively on ''P. pilosa''.  Phlox species are also a popular food source for groundhogs, rabbits and deer.

The '''strawberry''' (''Fragaria'')  is a genus of plants in the family Rosaceae, and the fruit of these plants. There are more than 20 named species and many hybrids and cultivars. The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the Garden strawberry, ''[[../Fragaria x ananassa/]]''. 

The typical modern strawberry grown as a food crop comes from the Americas, and is a hybrid of both north and South American varieties. Ironically, the crossbreeding was done in Europe to correct a mistake; the European horticulturists had only brought female South American plants, and were forced to cross them with the North American variety in order to get fruit and seeds.

Fragaria comes from &quot;fragans&quot;, meaning odorous, an allusion to the perfumed flesh of the fruit. Madam Tallien, a great figure of the French Revolution, who was nicknamed Our Lady of Thermidor, used to take baths full of strawberries to keep the full radiance of her skin. Fontenelle, centenarian writer and gourmet of the 18th century, considered his long life was due to the strawberries he used to eat.

==Description==
The strawberry is an accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the ovaries (which are the &quot;seeds&quot;, or achenes) but from the peg at the bottom of the hypanthium that held the ovaries. So from a technical standpoint, the seeds are the actual fruits of the plant, and the flesh of the strawberry is modified receptacle tissue.  It is greenish-white as it develops and in most species turns red when ripe.

==Growing Conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Varieties==
There are more than 20 different ''Fragaria'' species worldwide. Key to the classification of strawberry species is recognizing that they vary in the number of chromosomes. There are seven basic types of chromosomes that they all have in common. However, they exhibit different polyploidy. Some species are diploid, having two sets of the seven chromosomes (14 chromosomes total). Others are tetraploid (four sets, 28 chromosomes total), hexaploid (six sets, 42 chromosomes total), octoploid (eight sets, 56 chromosomes total), or decaploid (ten sets, 70 chromosomes total).

As a rough rule (with exceptions), strawberry species with more chromosomes tend to be more robust and produce larger plants with larger berries (Darrow).

;Diploid species
[[Image:Fragaria_vesca_2.jpg|thumb|right|Woodland Strawberry, ''Fragaria vesca'']]
*''[[../Fragaria daltoniana/]]''

*''[[../Fragaria nipponica/]]''
*''[[../Fragaria nubicola/]]''
*''[[../Fragaria vesca/]]'' (Woodland Strawberry)
*''[[../Fragaria viridis/]]''
*''[[../Fragaria yezoensis/]]''

;Tetraploid species
*''[[../Fragaria moupinensis/]]''
*''[[../Fragaria orientalis/]]''

;Hexaploid species
*''[[../Fragaria moschata/]]'' (Musk Strawberry) 

;Octoploid species and hybrids
*[[../Fragaria x ananassa/]] (Garden Strawberry)
*[[../Fragaria chiloensis/]] (Beach Strawberry)
*[[../Fragaria iturupensis/]] (Iturup Strawberry)
*[[../Fragaria virginiana/]] (Virginia Strawberry)

;Decaploid species and hybrids
*[[../Fragaria × Potentilla hybrids/]]
*''[[../Fragaria × vescana/]]''

Numerous other species have been proposed. Some are now recognized as subspecies of one of the above species (see GRIN taxonomy database). 

The Mock Strawberry and Barren Strawberry, which both bear resemblance to ''Fragaria'', are closely related species in the genus ''[[../Potentilla/]]''.  The Strawberry tree is an unrelated species.

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
&lt;!--discuss any special maintenance concerns, such as pruning, transplanting, monitoring, etc.--&gt;

==Propagation==
&lt;!--discuss propagation--&gt;

==Harvest==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''MINC in a few less than hard steps'''

The following set of tutorials are broken into three sections, the first involves all issues with installing MINC. The second  running the MINC command line tools and the third concerns using an example pipeline for automated analysis. These tutorials assume that you are using a linux-based system
an a &quot;sh&quot; variant shell such as bash, but should be reasonably easy to adapt to other settings.

== Installing and configuring MINC ==

The first step is to install the MINC library itself, this can be done by either compiling from source or by using a binary installer if you happen to be working on a platform that is currently supported. So you can pick either one of the first two tutorials here before progressing to the 3rd and 4th.

[[/SourceInstall/]] - Building the MINC tools from source

[[/BinaryInstalls/]] - How to install a binary MINC package

[[/InstallingPerl/]] - How to install the required perl modules

[[/AddingPaths/]] - Finishing off the installation

== Using the MINC command line tools ==

[[/Tutorials01/]] - Basic MINC commands from the toolbox

[[/Tutorials02/]] - Conversion to MINC, the MINC file format, information on files

== Programming with the MINC2 toolkit in C ==

[[/Programming01/]] - The MINC version of &quot;hello world.&quot;

[[/Programming02/]] - The two MINC coordinate systems.

[[/Programming03/]] - A fully functional and useful example on using voxel and world coordinates.

[[/Programming04/]] - Writing volumes to file, with an aside on slice scaling.

[[/Programming05/]] - Working with hyperslabs.

[[/Programming06/]] - Hyperslabs part 2: a slice loop with slice scaling

== Programming with MINC2 in python ==

[[/InstallingPyminc/]] - How to install pyminc.

[[/PythonExample/]] - A simple example for manipulating image data in Python.

[[/PythonSliceLoop/]] - How to run a slice loop in python for dealing with large amounts of data.

[[/NumericPyminc/]] - Why use python at all? See here - an illustration of solving the same problem in a bunch of ways.

== CVS and how to make a MINC package ==

[[/CVSandPackaging/]] - Procedure to follow to make a BIC source package and release it

== Reading/Writing MINC2.0 images from ITK (Insight Toolkit) ==

[[/part1/]] - Build ITK with MINC2.0 options enabled

== Installing MINC from sources , using big makefile (outdated)==

The MINC tools have been successfully compiled on a wide variety of systems. Including SGI, Sun, Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and VAX. This tutorial covers how to install the minc tools by compiling the sources. The tutorial presumes that you are using GNU/Linux, the procedure to build on other platforms is sometimes subtly different but will largely follow the example below.

==Prerequisites==

The MINC tools have a relatively large number of dependencies. The exact list of packages that needs to be installed before successfully compiling all the tools will depend on the target system, as every distribution of Linux/BSD comes with a different package set. In a new installation of Debian or Ubuntu, the following packages might be missing and need to be installed using apt-get or [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto synaptic] :

*HDF5
*NetCDF
*flex
*g++ (older versions of N3 require g++ 4.2, yet there is no such restriction for the latest N3 release)
*zlib1g-dev
*libnetpbm9-dev
*libxmu-dev
*libxi-dev
*libtext-format-perl
*autoconf
*byacc
also, latex tools might be necessary to build the documentation. The following packages are required only if installing ''Display'' and/or ''register'':
*opengl (libGL) dev
*glut (libglut) dev
This does not apply, however, for Nvidia-based video cards, which have their own libraries installed with the drivers. To check for these libraries, type:

 &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;glxgears&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

A window with rotating gears should appear.

To install everything in one go via apt-get on Ubuntu or Debian, this should suffice:

 &lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev libhdf5-serial-dev libnetpbm9-dev \
   fftw-dev libgsl0-dev libgetopt-tabular-perl libxext-dev glutg3-dev libsoqt3-dev \
   libxmu-dev libxi-dev imagemagick libtext-format-perl libpcre++0 libpcre3 \
   libsimage-dev libpcre++-dev autoconf perl-byacc flex g++ patch &lt;/code&gt;

In order to build the packages you might also need to install the compiler and GNU make:

   &lt;code&gt;$ sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make&lt;/code&gt;

== Building from the source code using one big makefile ==

A very large Makefile has been constructed, which builds much of the MNI-BIC content found on http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/tgz, in addition to a few other bits and pieces (notably parts of ITK). Please note that this process downloads, builds, and installs from source, and as such, if used, should be used instead of the aforementioned binary options (e.g. apt-getting minc-bundle). In addition, the presence of other minc libs from previous binary installs might result in the linker grabbing an older library, so it's best ensure that all previously installed minc components (e.g. netcdf, hdf5, etc) are removed prior to building. This method has been tested on several recent Linux distributions: Debian 5, Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10 &amp; 11.04.

==== Step 1: Download the Make file ====
This file is currently part of Vlad Fonov's EZminc package, so that's where to find it. If problems, contact Vladimir Fonov &lt;vladimir.fonov @NOSPAM@ mcgill.ca&gt;.

  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;wget https://raw.github.com/BIC-MNI/EZminc/master/build_quarantine/Makefile&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== Step 2: Decide on what you want to build ====
The Makefile provides quite a few build targets, the two extremes being ''make minc-only'' and ''make minc-full''. Type ''make help'' to get a little help info, or take a look at the Makefile header with your favorite text editor in order to read details on all targets.

==== Step 3: Create your build and install directories ====
The Makefile downloads source packages and builds them in a user-defined build directory, specified via the '''BUILD_DIR''' argument. Create this directory prior to starting the build. If not specified, the build will occur in your current directory (which is messy). All build products will be installed to the specified '''INSTALL_DIR'''. Note that if you want to install to a system directory, say, ''/usr/local/bic'', you will need to run the Makefile under sudo.

==== Step 4: Ensure that prerequisite packages are installed ====
Even though the big Makefile builds a lot of stuff, there are still some non-MNI-BIC packages that will need to be installed prior to the Make. Simply apt-get these packages; the Makefile header contains the apt-get statement that should do the job.

==== Step 5: Run your build(s) ====
OK, now for the moment of truth. Here are some build examples:

* Minimal build: netcdf, hdf5, minc
&lt;code&gt;
 make minc-only BUILD_DIR=$HOME/temp/build_minc INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/minc
&lt;/code&gt;

* Full build: Build lots of stuff, plus register and Display, and install the MNI-BIC fitting models
&lt;code&gt;
 make minc-full BUILD_DIR=$HOME/temp/build_minc INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/minc
 make models BUILD_DIR=$HOME/temp/build_minc INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/minc
 make visual BUILD_DIR=$HOME/temp/build_minc INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/minc
&lt;/code&gt;

Please note that if anything goes wrong in one of the builds, the building of all dependent packages will not be attempted. To fix build errors, simply go into your '''BUILD_DIR'''/package_name directory and have a fiddle. As a matter of fact, this sort of fiddling is currently required when building Display under Ubuntu Lucid LTS (''make visual''), due to problems with libtool.

==Building individual packages==

It's possible to compile the MINC tools from individual packages. A typical installation will require:
*minc-2
*mni_autoreg
*bicpl
*conglomerate
*ebtks
*classify
*inormalize
*Register
*mincblob
*mincmorph
*mni_perllib
*N3
*ray_trace
*Display

Valuable additional scripts can be found here: http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/scripts/; these can be downloaded after the MINC tools have been installed.

First download the latest version of the MINC 2.x toolchain from http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/tgz

   $ wget http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/tgz/minc-2.0.18.tar.gz

Then untar the package 

   $ tar zxvf minc-2.0.18.tar.gz

Enter the directory

   $ cd minc-2.0.18

At this stage you should of course read the README file, and NEWS and ChangeLog files to discern what changes have been made since the last release. Lets presume you have done this. 

In our case we want to install all the MINC Tools in /usr/local/bic and know that NetCDF and HDF5 have been previously installed in /usr/local. As such we will configure the package like this:

   $ ./configure --with-build-path=/usr/local --prefix=/usr/local/bic

Note that with the minc2 libraries you will need to add an additional flag:

   $ ./configure --with-minc2 --with-build-path=/usr/local --prefix=/usr/local/bic

A bunch of output will result from this command as configure checks for various libraries on your system. Running configure should generate a makefile. Which we can now use 

   $ make

This will build all the MINC files and now we can run the inbuilt checks that come with the MINC package. This is one of the advantages of building MINC from source as you can run the checks yourself, binary packages do not afford this possibility as the presumption is make that a build on one system will be fine on another system of the same platform. To run the checks type:

   $ make check

The checks that are running will determine if underlying MINC API is self consistent plus a few other checks. Once the checks are complete the status is returned. You should see a line similar to this:

   All 3 tests passed

It is now time to install MINC, given that we provided configure with a prefix argument this is the directory where the MINC API and base tools will be installed. In our case this is /usr/local/bic to do this type the following:

   $ make install

This will install a number of things into four subdirectories in /usr/local/bic. Executable programs in bin/ header files in include/ library files in lib/ and manual pages in man/. 

We can test the installation with something like this:

   $ mincmath -version

This should return both the version number of the program and the underlying libraries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">MINC has pre-built binaries for the following distributions/architectures

== Debian GNU/Linux || Ubuntu ==

For this build type the dpkg and apt-get style of installation is used. The source deb files can be found here

   http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/debian-lenny

For a different system, deb needs to be replaced by the appropriate extension (for example ubuntu-maverick). See [[MINC/Installation|Installation]] for a list of supported operating systems. To install the packages do this:

''NB: when using Ubuntu use sudo to run the following commands (ie: add a &quot;sudo&quot; to the front of all of the following steps. If not, run the following commands as root.''

Step 1: Run the following to add a line to /etc/apt/sources.list to tell apt-get to look at the packages website for the MINC packages.

   # echo &quot;deb http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/debian-lenny ./&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list

Alternatively, using the graphical interface, go in &quot;System&gt;Administration&gt;Synaptic manager&gt;Configuration&gt;Settings&quot; and click on add. Then add the line &quot;deb http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/deb ./&quot; and click on &quot;add source&quot;. For some reason, this will generate two new entries in the list of repositories. Click on the &quot;MINC (sources)&quot; repository and click &quot;remove&quot; to avoid getting error messages latter on.

Step 2: Update the internal list of packages

   # apt-get update

Alternatively, using the graphical interface, click on &quot;update&quot; in synaptic manager.

Step 3: Install you packages of choice (here we install MINC, mni-autoreg and all the mni-models packages). 

   # apt-get install minc mni-autoreg mni-models*

Note that, when available, the minc-bundle package will install all minc tools &amp; associated softwares. Alternatively, using the graphical interface, search for the package in synaptic manager, right click on the package name, select &quot;install&quot; and then click on &quot;apply changes&quot;. A tutorial on synaptic manager can be found on [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto&quot;Ubuntu's help center&quot;].

== Mac OSX Jaguar/Panther/Tiger (10.1-10.4) ==

For this build type the NeXT .pkg style of installation is used (given that this is what Apple use for OSX). The source packages can be found here

   http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/osx

To install the packages do this:

''This should apply to both an Intel and PPC Mac but when I wrote this I was fiddling with a MacBook''

Step 1: install X11 and XCode from the Install DVD that came with your mac. X11 is part of the Optional Packages on you installation DVD, you will find it as X11SDK.pkg in the Tools/Packages subdirectory on the Xcode DVD (generally!)

Step 2: download the packages you want from the site above

Step 3: Click on each of the packages in turn and then press OK/Agree a lot of times for each one.

Step 4: Realise that step #3 is somewhat tedious and use a Command line to do it. To do this, first untar the packages and then install using &quot;installer&quot;

   $ tar zxvf minc-xxxx.pkg.tar.gz
   $ sudo installer -target / -pkg minc-xxxx.pkg

Note that in Step #4 we use sudo so that the packages are installed in /usr/local/mni. Note also that the installer command can take multiple .pkg files at once so you could so something like this to first untar all the packages in the directory in which you downloaded them and then install them

   $ for i in `ls -1 *.pkg.tar.gz`; do tar zxvf $i; done
   $ for i in `ls -1 *.pkg`; do sudo installer -target / -pkg $i; done

Now all you need do is ensure that you have an install of netcdf on your mac somewhere. If you dont know if you do, then you likely dont... The easiest way to get netcdf is via the fink project. First, install fink (www.finkproject.org) if you dont have it. It will be installed at /sw/bin/. Then type: 

   $ sudo fink install netcdf 

to get netcdf. While you are at it with fink you may as well install netpbm that is required by register and Display:

   $ sudo fink install netpbm

Then you should be done

== XP/Cygwin ==

For this build type I have not yet figured out a nice consistent way to build .deb dpkg files under debian that work. Nor have I put the time into figuring our the cygwin installer package structure (but will eventually). So what this means is that the cygwin download is a static .tar.gz archive of pre-compiled binaries that I build and release from time to time.

   http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/cygwin

To install the packages do this:

Step 1: Download Setup.exe from the Cygwin website and install Cygwin. I use the following settings:

   Root Directory:     C:\cygwin    (All users/UNIX file type)
   Local Package Dir:  C:\cygwin\dnld

Step 2: Add the packages in the X11 and development sections

Step 3: Download the latest static build of the MINC toolset from the webpage mentioned above. Move this file to C:\cygwin\usr\local

Step 4: Start a cygwin shell and then run the following to &quot;install&quot;.

   $ tar zxvf minc-xxxxxx.tar.gz

      <text xml:space="preserve">The base MINC package and a number of the extra packages use a few PERL modules that are not installed on many systems by default. The most common of these are mni_perllib and Getopt::Tabular. You can get mni_perllib from here:

Other PERL modules can be downloaded from CPAN

      <comment>added info on internal compression in MINC2</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">All we need to do now is to add the executables to your PATH environment variable. This is different depending on whether you use a sh or csh shell variant. In our case and for the remainder of this tutorial we will presume we are using the bash shell. To do this in bash add the following line to your .bashrc file. 

   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bic/bin

Whilst we are at it we should also add the manual pages.

   export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/usr/local/bic/man

If we plan to compile other libraries or executables against the base MINC package we can also add the following to make life easier:

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/bic/lib

Depending how you compiled MINC, you may have to export the path to the MNI PERL libraries as well :

   export PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:$HOME/minc/perl

If you are using the MINC2 version of the libraries, but want to use the MINC1 format, you will also have to add :

   unset MINC_FORCE_V2

To change the default level of internal compression (minc2 formal only, 0 is no compression, 9 is maximal compression):

   export MINC_COMPRESS=7

Now all we need do is re-source our .bashrc file. 

   $ . ~/.bashrc

      <comment>/* Basic MINC commands */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">By the end of this tutorial you should be proficient in the usage of the basic MINC commands such as mincresample, mincreshape and mincmath. 

== Basic MINC commands ==

Everything you do in MINC is based upon the idealogogy of Unix, that is tackle large problems with a combination of smaller programs that can be combined in many different ways. Whilst this is not the easiest system to learn, you will find it to be extremely flexible if you persevere and take time to learn the various ways that each of the commands can be used. 

One of the ways to do this is to exhaustively read the man pages of all of the commands. 

   $ man mincinfo

Of course I would not recommend this if you are just beginning to use MINC as at this stage you are probably better to learn by example. However as you become more proficient with the commands you will find this very useful, albeit time consuming. A quick summary of help for each of the base commands can also be obtained at the command line by using the -help flag. 

   $ mincinfo -help

This will provide a listing of all the options that a particular command will take with a brief summary of its uses. Further details can always be found in the man page. 

Whilst MINC programs are built on the Unix philosophy there is one differentation that is caused by the use of netCDF as the underlying library, pipes are not supported. This means that you cannot join the output of a series of MINC commands together using pipes. Instead you must always output the results of each command to a file. As such most commands follow the following convention:

   $ mincxxx [options] &lt;infile.mnc&gt; &lt;outfile.mnc&gt;

In some cases a MINC command will take multiple input files and as such the command will look like this:

   $ mincxxx [options] &lt;infile1.mnc&gt; [&lt;infile2.mnc&gt; [...]] &lt;outfile.mnc&gt;

You can ascertain as to which of these two most common variations the command follows by using the -help option. The usage information is output at the end of the help. 

   $ mincmath -help

At this stage you may be wondering the significance of the [] and &lt;&gt; brackets, this notation is commonly used to describe command line programs input. A [] bracket indicates an optional argument and &lt;&gt; brackets indicate a required argument. 


=== Common options ===

There are a number of options that are common across many of the commands. They are:

   -clobber

This option applies to the output file and should be used if the output file already exsists and you wish to overwrite it. If you do not use this option and the output file already exsists an error message will be printed and the program will exit without doing anything. 

   -verbose and -quiet

These options either increase or decrease the amount of output a command will produce. They have not effect on the result of the command merely the amount of information that is echoed to the screen. 

   -double, -float, -int, -short, -byte

These options specify the precision with which you desire the output of the current command. MINC has been designed such that at any stage you should not have to concern yourself with the datatype and range that your data is using. Your data is defined as existing as a Real (any positive or negative number) and a mapping is done internally to the current datatype.

[[Image:Real-to-Voxel-intensity-range.png|500px|Real to Voxel Intensity Mapping]]

The above figure demonstrates how an Image with a real (use-visible) range of 0 to 2000 can be mapped into a signed byte data type. Of course during this conversion the data will be discretised to 256 points of precision. It is for this reason that the choice is given to the user to choose the output precision for each MINC command should they wish a greater precision of output at any stage. If no datatype is explicitly chosen the MINC tools will use the datatype of the first input file.

   -signed, -unsigned

Specifes as to whether a signed or an unsigned integer type is to be used for storage of data. Note that in most cases unless the data is being prepared for a specific purpose the user should not have to specify these options as the MINC file will rescale a real image range to either an unsigned or signed type with no loss or gain in performance or accuracy. These two options have no effect when used in conjunction with either -double or -float.

   -copy_header, -nocopy_header

All MINC files have an integrated header that can contain any amount of metadata that is associated with a file. These options specify if this metadata is to be copied to the output file. Generally the default here is to copy the header from the first input file to the output file. There are many cases however in which you would not want to do this, for example if you are making a composite image (average) from a series of input files. In this case you probably do not want the metadata information from the first file including the subjects name, date of birth and other details copied to your output file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a HOWTO for creating a BIC package and some guidelines to release it upon the world

== Package naming rules ==

The first thing you need to decide is what you are going to call your package. In general the prefix &quot;minc&quot; is reserved for packages/programs that will work on any MINC file (mincmath, mincresample, etc), be it 3D, 10D or even 1D. If your program/package is more suited to working on volumes (3D) then the suggestion is to prefix it with &quot;vol&quot;. Granted this rule has not always been followed in the past (minctracc, mincmorph) but we needn't let that drag us back.

Your package name should also not contain UPPER CASE letters or underscores &quot;_&quot; as this will cause problems later on when you come to build binary packages for some systems (debian linux for example). Numbers and the dash character &quot;-&quot; are allowed in package names. Again, this rule has not always been followed (mni_autoreg for example) and subsequent pain has ensued.

Examples of good names include:

   mincshazam - the name we shall use in the examples on this page
   volpls-fmri - a package to analyse fmri data via PLS
   mincinvert - a package/program to invert a file
   voldegibbs - a package to remove gibbs ringing from an image

Don't do this:

   mincprocess - far too general
   vol-do-emma-processing - processing for emma, to generic and emma will leave eventually
   vol-do-something-with-a-really-long-name
   mincfoo
   mincb

== Setting up CVS the BIC way ==

By now you have probably written some of your code and have it stored in your home directory, this is good as it is backed up but if you wanted to know what changes you made 3 days ago you will need something like CVS to track changes. CVS allows you to do this via repositories of code. This HOWTO will assume that from now on you are using CVS for your code and know how to use it.  If not, you'd be best advised to go away and read this: [http://ximbiot.com/cvs/wiki]

The current CVSROOT for the BIC is on cvs.bic.mni.mcgill.ca in /private-cvsroot so the following lines in your .bashrc will work wonders:

  $ export CVSROOT=cvs.bic.mni.mcgill.ca:/private-cvsroot
  $ export CVS_RSH=ssh

In your case the second line is probably not needed as you will be local to the bic, but should you wish to use a remote repository then it comes in very handy.

You may also like to define a few defaults for CVS commands via a ~/.cshrc file, here is what I use and recommend

   $ cat ~/.cvsrc
   checkout -P
   update -d -P
   diff -u -b -B
   tag -c
   
   # if you'd like cvs to be a bit quieter, comment out this
   # cvs -q

Use man to find out what these do but they are a good set of defaults for new users of CVS

== Creating a package from scratch ==

Whilst it might seem like a large amount of overhead we use automake and autoconf to package source so that we can be sure that they will compile on a multitude of platforms. To get started with this, create yourself a local cvs directory

   $ mkdir ~/cvs
   $ cd ~/cvs

Then export a copy of the BIC example package

   $ cvs export -r HEAD libraries/mni-example-package

Then decide where you are going to place your package in cvs (take a look about /software/source).; If you need help with where to place your package send Andrew Janke an email: a.janke@gmail.com For now we'll assume that we are going to place our package in libraries. Rename the example package

   $ mv libraries/mni-example-package libraries/mincshazam
   $ cd libraries/mincshazam

Place the name and email address of the package creators in the AUTHORS file

   $ cat AUTHORS 
   Andrew Janke &lt;a.janke@gmail.com&gt;

Add the licence you are going to use to the file COPYING. In this case we have used the MINC modified BSD style license. For guidelines/suggestions on which licence to use see Licensing below.

   $ cat COPYING 
   Copyright 2006-2007 Andrew L Janke

   suitability of this software for any purpose.  It is provided &quot;as is&quot;
   without express or implied warranty.

Write the README. The README that you will already have in the current directory should be read and digested. It describes in better detail than this HOWTO where you can get more info on automake, autoconf and related tools. Remember that the README is the first file that a package builder will (or at least ''should'') read.

   $ cat README
   The mincshazam package contains mincshazam
   
   It does magic on minc files so amazing that all people should have it.
   If you don't like it, too bad.

Copy in your source file(s) and remove the examples.

   $ cp ~/src/good_stuff/mincshazam.c .
   $ rm -f example_tags.c example_volume_io.c example_modify.c

Edit configure.ac to suit (read the autoconf man pages and the likes for more info). Suffice to say just editing the example that is given will suit most purposes. The most important parts to fill in are the three components of AC_INIT. Later when we build a proper BIC package this is the information that will be returned via the -version flag to your program.

   $ cat configure.ac 
   # Require autoconf 2.57 or newer.
   AC_PREREQ([2.57])
   
   # The arguments are package name, and package version.
   AC_INIT([mincshazam],[1.0], [Andrew Janke &lt;a.janke@gmail.com&gt;])
   
   # The argument is any source file distributed with the package.
   AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR([mincshazam.c])
   
   AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
   
   # The argument is the name of the generated header file.
   # It is recommended to leave it as &quot;config.h&quot;.
   AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])
   
   # This macro eases building the package; see m4/README.
   smr_WITH_BUILD_PATH
   
   # Checks for programs.
   AC_PROG_CC
   AC_PROG_INSTALL
   
   # Checks for libraries.  See m4/README.
   mni_REQUIRE_VOLUMEIO
   
   # Finish up by writing output files.
   AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
   AC_OUTPUT

Add your source files to Makefile.am. Again see the automake documentation for more info on this file. As always with anything to do with Make, be sure to uses tabs and not spaces when indenting. I suspect automake may handle spaces in some releases but you never know, best to err on the side of caution.

   $ cat Makefile.am 
   AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS = check-news
   ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4
   
   bin_PROGRAMS = mincshazam
   
   EXTRA_DIST = $(m4_files)
   
   m4_files = m4/mni_REQUIRE_LIB.m4 m4/mni_REQUIRE_MNILIBS.m4       \
           m4/mni_REQUIRE_OPENINVENTOR.m4                           \
           m4/mni_cxx_have_koenig_lookup.m4 m4/smr_CGAL_MAKEFILE.m4 \
           m4/smr_OPTIONAL_LIB.m4 m4/smr_REQUIRED_LIB.m4            \
           m4/smr_WITH_BUILD_PATH.m4
   
   mincshazam_SOURCES = mincshazam.c

Write your inital entry in the Changelog. The purpose of the ChangeLog is to communicate in simple(r) terms a summary of changes that you have made to a repository as part of a CVS commit to other developers. It need not be as detailed as the information you enter as part of the cvs commit but should instead contain a summary of the general reason for the changes.

   $ cat ChangeLog 
   2006-04-06  Andrew L. Janke  &lt;a.janke@gmail.com&gt;
   
        * made this marvelous package
        * Added the -version option

Make an empty NEWS file. This file will get its turn when we make our first release later on.

   echo  &gt; NEWS

You shouldn't have to modify anything in autogen.sh but we'll cat it here so that it doesn't feel left out. It probably already feels less important that configure.ac and Makefile.am for one good reason, it is. A script called autogen.sh is not required, you could just run the three commands listed below in order and all would be good. autogen.sh is merely a convention that most people who use automake and autoconf follow.

   $ cat autogen.sh 
   #! /bin/sh
   
   set -e
   
   aclocal -I m4
   autoheader
   automake --add-missing --copy
   autoreconf

Read README.CVS, remember it then remove it, the instructions it contains will be used later.

   $ rm -f README.CVS

It is now high time we did our initial cvs import

   $ cvs import -m 'initial import' libraries/mincshazam mni initial-import 

The &quot;mni&quot; argument is the vendor branch and the &quot;initial-import&quot; argument is the tag that is associated with this operation so that you can go back to the inital import should you wish.

Now remembering what you were instructed to do in README.CVS, do this:

   $ cvs -d cvs.bic.mni.mcgill.ca:/private-cvsroot checkout -d m4 libraries/mni-acmacros

This will get you a copy of the most recent BIC m4 macros that are most commonly used. You should now have a directory called m4, it contains macros that autoconf uses to create the configure file for your package.

We are now finished creating our initial package, here is what you should have except of course with your own source files in there.

   $ ls -F
   AUTHORS  ChangeLog    NEWS    autogen.sh*   m4/
   COPYING  Makefile.am  README  configure.ac  mincshazam.c

Note that we get a copy of the m4 macros after our inital import such that we do not add them to our repository. We merely use them as a repository in its own right within our repository. Changes you make within m4 will be commited to the m4 repository. (be carefull here, others may well not like you much if you mess with the default m4 macros).

== Building your package from scratch ==

At this stage you have files that automake and autoconf can process to form a configure script and then a subsequent Makefile. The first stage is to generate a configure script that you can distribute. Others who download a source version of your package will use this configure script to make a Makefile and then compile from there. The commands required to make configure script from the files you have are in the little shell autogen.sh

   $ cat autogen.sh 
   #! /bin/sh
   
   set -e
    
   aclocal -I m4
   autoheader
   automake --add-missing --copy
   autoreconf

Run autogen.sh

   $ ./autogen.sh 
   /usr/share/aclocal/gtk.m4:7: warning: underquoted definition of AM_PATH_GTK
     run info '(automake)Extending aclocal'
     or see http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Extending-aclocal
   /usr/share/aclocal/glib.m4:8: warning: underquoted definition of AM_PATH_GLIB
   configure.ac: installing `./install-sh'
   configure.ac: installing `./missing'
   Makefile.am: installing `./INSTALL'
   Makefile.am: installing `./depcomp'

The warnings above can be (very) safely ignored.

This will produce you a configure script, run it with appropriate options (./configure --help for more info). In our case we building against extra libraries that can be found in /usr/local/bic and also going to be installing our package in /usr/local/bic .

   $ configure --with-build-path=/usr/local/bic --prefix=/usr/local/bic
   checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c
   checking whether build environment is sane... yes
   &lt;...&gt;
   config.status: creating Makefile
   config.status: creating config.h
   config.status: executing depfiles commands

Presuming all went well with the configure step above, make your package. If things fail or you fail to get a Makefile the first thing to check is that you have up to date versions of automake and autoconf. Beyond this it really gets beyond the scope of this HOWTO.

   $ make
   &lt;...&gt;

At this stage you should have a directory looking something like this:

   $ ls
   AUTHORS    Makefile.am  autogen.sh*      config.status*  m4/           stamp-h1
   COPYING    Makefile.in  autom4te.cache/  configure*      mincshazam*
   ChangeLog  NEWS         config.h         configure.ac    mincshazam.c
   INSTALL    README       config.h.in      depcomp*        mincshazam.o
   Makefile   aclocal.m4   config.log       install-sh*     missing*

Note that we do not need to add any of these automake/autoconf generated files to our cvs repository as they all can (and should) be regenerated for differing software platforms and versions of autotools.

== Release procedure -- creating a source package to distribute ==

First decide on the type of versioning you are going to use for your package, typically only a dotted duple is needed. ie: 1.02  with occasional forrays into a dotted tuple if the package has 
many incremental releases (1.2.03).

Once you have a version numbering scheme in place, follow these set of rules (in strict order!)

1. If this is your first release, insert your initial version into configure.ac. If not, make sure that the version number is correct for this release. In our case, 1.0 is the first release so we can leave it as is from the previous section.

   AC_INIT([mincshazam],[1.0], [Andrew Janke &lt;a.janke@gmail.com&gt;])

2. update NEWS with info on the current relase that can be digested by users of the package.

   $ cat NEWS 
   New in release 1.0 
   ------------------
   * Initial version.

3. Configure, build, and do a test install.

   $ ./configure --with-build-path=/usr/local/mni --prefix=/usr/local/mni
   $ make
   $ make install

4. commit to make sure we are up to date in case someone else has made some changes to the package.

   $ cvs commit

5. Create the distribution with distcheck.

   $ make distcheck

This will make a file called mincshazam-1.0.tar.gz

6. Test build from this tarball on another system.

7. Copy the tarball to your distribution site. (in our case typically http://packages.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/tgz for source packages.

8. Tag your release so that you can return to this version anytime you want. The tag should follow the following format

   &lt;package-name&gt;-&lt;version number using '-'&gt;

In our case this translates to

   $ cvs tag mincshazam-1-0

9. Update the version number in configure.in so that there is no chance that someone else or yourself can make a different release with the same version number. In this case it is best to update the version number only in the least most significant field.

   AC_INIT([mincshazam],[1.1], [Andrew Janke &lt;a.janke@gmail.com&gt;])

10. Commit the bumped version number

   $ cvs commit .


== adding binary building capability to your package ==

I really should finish this section

epm-header.in

== adding a -version flag to your packages executables and scripts ==

blankety blank blank


== Licensing types ==

Use the MINC one if possible (a modification of the older BSD license) or the GPL if you have included GPL code from elsewhere. A MINC tool that uses the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a good example of this.

other types in here?

== migrating your cvs directory ==

The original home (for many years) of CVS at the BIC was shadow:/software/source. This changed on the 23/08/2006 such that we could finally have a public CVS repository and a split public and private portion of CVS.

If you have an existing cvs directory that is already checked out and would like to migrate it as you have some changes in it to the new server (cvs.bic.mni.mcgill.ca) then all you need do is edit the CVS/Root files in each respository that you have checked out to reflect the new home. The files should have a single line in them as such:

   cvs.bic.mni.mcgill.ca:/private-cvs

I realise that this may cause some short-term pain but I do believe it to be for the better or I wouldn't have done it!

Good luck and email me (Andrew Janke - a.janke@gmail.com) if you have problems.

== Hi from [[User:Zweifel]] ==

Hey -- I haven't logged into Wikibooks in a year. I got your message today.  I am definitely going to check out your Dutch Wikibooks, because I've been casually learning Dutch for a while.  Prepositional adverbs are awesome.  Anyway, it's cool that there are grammar geeks out there.  I'll catch you later.

BTW, I am User:Zweifel on Wikipedia.  [[User:Zweifel|Zweifel]] ([[User talk:Zweifel|talk]]) 15:02, 14 February 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Discussion &quot;Misgivings about the book's approach&quot; moved to [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming]].'''

Does anyone else think that this is a little harsh when it talks about the mentally ill?  It seems as though it clumps every mental disorder together and considers the brain unstable for anything.  Is how lucid dreaming affects them proven, or is it just a guess by the authors? Or is this a general consensus among the lucid sleepers? --[[User:Emlnxrz|Emlnxrz]] 15:30, 18 June 2004 (UTC)

: I myself have never heard of all this stuff. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 08:13, 19 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Are they &quot;levels&quot; of sleep or &quot;stages&quot;.  Or aren't these actually used synonymously?  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 04:53, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Synonymous. I will change all uses to levels because they are usually called levels 1 to 4. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 05:02, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Oh, and welcome to the lucid dreaming wikibook! Got any feedback? How's your dream recall going or have you not done anything? :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 13:22, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::I haven't really tried any of this yet.  I'll probably start working on my dream recall this summer or next schoolyear.  I'll be heading off to college, and it seems like a good time to start new things like a dream journal.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 04:06, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:::Cool. Any feedback, please tell me. And by the way, if you become LD obsessed, the ld4all.com forums is a good visit, despite the spiritual stuff floating around in masses. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 08:24, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

&quot;We awake quite often throughout the night, but if it is for less than 3 minutes it is usually forgotten by the time we wake up.&quot;
:Really?

::[http://www.here-be-dreams.com/sleep/stages.html source]. Now that I look at it, it seems it only happens after some REM and not after every REM. I'll try to clarify... it's only quasi-awake (or pseudo-awake ;) ) anyway, you get hypnagogic/hypnapompic imagery which probably goes along the same lines as the dream.

:::Why can't I seem to remember hypnagogic/hypnapompic imagery?

::::I have found that it slips away as I get out of bed in the morning. Can't you remember that you have wierd thoughts, illogical, irrational etc. when you are still drowsy in bed? That is hypnagogic/hypnapompic imagery. Also voices and any other vivid odd feelings (such as falling).

The &quot;I can't control my dreams&quot; section is badly written in my opinion. I can't do it better myself, so I just complain here instead. It's not clear if it refers to lucid dreams or not (this is an introduction, most people probably haven't much lucid dream experience yet). Further, I would say there are many levels of lucidity. You might vaguely know that you are dreaming without being able to control the dream, ''especially in the beginning''. Control is something you practice. Moreover, the connection between the Mother Theresa section is quite week. What is it really about?

: I'm glad you realise that you're able to correct it :). I was not referring to lucid dreams, but more the feeling of &quot;watching&quot; a dream and not &quot;acting&quot; in it. There certainly are different levels of lucidity, and lucidity in lucid dreams should generally increase with practice. Now that I look at the second paragraph of that question, I have no clue why I put that in. I'll take it out soon if I don't remember, or link it in more fully if I do.

I believe the whole introduction feels more like a &quot;Lucid dreaming FAQ&quot;. It answer questions newbie lucid dreamers might have rather than introducing the reader to the subject.

: It seems to me to get the content through. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 14:43, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

====Dissociation====

What do you think about the addition I made to the Dissociation section (things you should NOT be experiencing)? It does seem a bit scary to me, is it worth including at all?

[[User:Kaycee|KC]] 23:08, 17 Apr 2004 (UTC)


Yes, it does seem a bit scary -- just about everything in that list has happened to me at one time or another in real life.
&quot;''Finding oneself in a place but unaware of how one got there''&quot; ?
I thought this happened to just about everyone the first few times they wake up in an unfamiliar place.
I remember that happened when I woke up after the first time I spent the night at Grandmom's house.

Perhaps we should move the Dissociation section to a completely different page and merely link to it.
Would [[wikipedia:dissociation]] be appropriate ?

Hello from a wikinewbie! I have had many LD's and would like to offer a few comments, I have chosen to put them all here until I have more time, and hopefully sources other than my (and friends') experiences. Also please inform if I am breaking with convention in this post. 

RE: &quot;signs you weren't&quot;...Entering a dream within a dream is a technique for better lucidity, also some of the most profound are when one already lucid enters another realm, often experienced as going to sleep when you already know you are dreaming. (one ref. would be works by Dr. Alberto Villoldo)

RE: Dissociation: I think it is scary, and maybe misleading. I think it's a great idea to have some mention here, but perhaps it could be shortened and refer to some authority on dissociative behavior. (If community thinks it's important enough to mention, then it's too important for us nonpsychology experts to advise much)
:also on this topic, I feel that some of these things are common (if very brief), and may be a sign of personal progress. e.g. ability to see oneself as other can be healthy analization. I hate to over discourage folks on a good path, so while I'm not able to do better with this page, it strikes me as analogous to quitting playing an instrument if you suddenly play a song very well, or improvise music that is better than you thought yourself capable of.
I would appreciate knowing if I should post differently.
Would it be helpful to this book to find links to forums, or maybe start a &quot;recomended reading list&quot; [[User:GreenTwin|GreenTwin]] 18:36, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: Hello to you! There is no convention you should follow in the talk pages. If you'de like to contribute to the main book though, check [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming]] first for a few basic guidelines.

: Dreams within dreams: I've never heard of that and can't think why it would work (beyond the placebo effect). Besides, that's a different case. That's somebody who ''knows'' about lucid dreams who then becomes lucid and uses that technique in order to gain better lucidity. The fact is, generally people who enter a lucid dream from within a dream aren't really lucid, they're only dreaming that they are.

: Community no more. I don't have an opinion on the dissociation section because I don't understand it.

: (Why did you indent that twice?) What do you mean by &quot;ability to see oneself as other&quot;? What do you mean by things being brief? What is &quot;healthy analization&quot;? Sorry, I don't understand you.

: There is already a &quot;recommended reading list&quot;. It's called &quot;Further Reading&quot; and it's on the nav:
{{LDTOC}}
: It includes links to forums and books. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:52, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

----

I'm a little concerned that the book presents 'symptoms' that only a few may have experienced  as concrete aspects of Lucid Dreaming. Most of the list of dissociations could possibly be explained by other psychological explanations and not related to Lucid Dreaming, and yet here they are being listed as factual symptoms.

It might be better to have this introduced as things that some people have experienced whilst attempted to experience Lucid Dreaming'.

====Spinning?====

&quot;Attempting to spin&quot; - what does it mean? If it means literally spin, what is so special about it? And if you use a different meaning, please elaborate.

:Anything that gives your senses input from the dream world is fine. Spinning is a good way to &quot;lock&quot; yourself more into the dream consciousness, by asking your brain to generate more substance to the dream. Another way is to focus on dream visuals to make them more stable. Am I making any sense? [[User:Kaycee|KC]] 22:03, 18 May 2004 (UTC)

:Yes, it means literally spin. It's the sort of thing which somebody who knows about lucid dreaming would do. It's the sort of thing I do in a lucid dream, because it prolongs my dreams (see [[LD Using]] and the above post) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 06:21, 19 May 2004 (UTC)

== Reasons to pursue lucid dreaming ==

Thanks for all the work you have put into this wikibook.  When I came upon this subject initially, I had one central question on my mind.  Namely, is lucid dreaming a fruitful pursuit, or merely a frivolous diversion from the transcendental purposes of life?  I decided to give lucid dreaming a try.  I got a notebook and began to record my dreams.  I began to ponder the matter of how I knew during waking moments that I was in the physical world.  I hydrated copiously before  retiring.  In the end I lost interest because I just couldn't convince myself there was transcendental purpose in lucid dreaming.  It would be a great contribution to this Wikibook to have a more fully developed section about the rationale for studying/pursuing lucid dreaming.  Does lucid dreaming enhance one's ability to understand and practice sacrificial love and to make the best use of one's time in this world?  How?  Why is it that the majority of discussion of lucid dreaming seems to be from a purposeless or frivolous perspective?  I think all this would make a very interesting addition to the Wikibook.  [[User:216.160.223.49|216.160.223.49]] 21:41, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Most people take it as a &quot;frivolous pursuit&quot;. However:
* Some people have said that meditating (or dreaming) within a dream has felt to them particularly deep, that they found it easier to relax, etc.
* You can try shared dreaming from it as well as attempt astral projection.
* Considering that (healthy people) spend about 1/3 of their time sleeping and 1/4 of their time dreaming, I would say that lucid dreaming aids effective use of time. You're using that remaining 1/12 of living life at not much cost to the rest of your time. As some people have reported solving problems in dreams, you might be able to solve some of your own. Also, your artistic side is probably more &quot;open&quot; - pasQuale dreamed up the two most recent designs of [http://ld4all.com LD4all.com].
: I would imagine that there is not much interest in lucid dreaming for spirituality because Stephen LaBerge, who proved lucid dreaming, did not publish any mention of it in his book. Therefore people went along the &quot;fun and silly&quot; route. However, I don't see why this should stop you from trying lucid dreaming, because it honestly is great fun and very satisfying when you become lucid. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:32, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC) PS You will get more replies by joining a forum or asking on alt.dreams.lucid. Check the &quot;further reading&quot; section.

== last section and hypnosis ==

I believe the last part is way off. Self hypnosis as I understand doesn't lead to any visual/etc experiences and can't really be compared with lucid dreaming. Apart from the fact that you are interacting with your subconscious on a different level.

: Well, it does say '''If'' you often enter a &quot;dream world&quot;' . . . but I see your point. I don't have any strong feelings about it either way; if you want to remove that part, go ahead. —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tharenthel|(Talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Tharenthel|(Contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:07, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

== False Awakenings ==

The section on false awakenings really needs improvement!  I don't understand what it is about.  Link it or expand it, something needs to be added. -- [[User:Phyzome|Phyzome]] 22:34, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

: I tried to clarify it some. It does still need some work, but it hopefully makes more sense now. —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Tharenthel|(Talk)]] [[Special:Contributions/Tharenthel|(Contribs)]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:19, 5 April 2006 (UTC)


==Note==   
I've removed the reference to the &quot;placebo effect&quot;.   

The Note is really a Disclaimer.  However this paragraph about the effect of your own expectations helps to avoid it just looking like a CYA move.  Having said that, I think we want the Note to be nice and short.

The &quot;placebo&quot; reference is somewhat confusing.  The paragraph is trying to make a wider point that theres a limit to how far any technique can take you; that in the end its your own attitude that determines how you dream.  However the &quot;placebo effect&quot; refers specifically to a &quot;pharmacologically inert&quot; &quot;preparation&quot; - something that mimics medication, and is supposed to have no effect other than making someone think they're being given treatment, in a double blind trial or where there is no more effective alternative (&quot;Headology&quot;, for the Prattchett fan).

The use of the phrase &quot;placebo effect&quot; could also be confused with the previous paragraph which is a disclaimer about the potentially lucid inducing substances listed later on in the book.  TBH that's probably how the &quot;placebo effect&quot; paragraph originated, but I think my way is better :-).

Of course, since I'm editting this anonymously, haven't contributed significantly to this project etc., feel free to disagree violently and revert my change - but it'd be best if you could explain why I'm wrong.

[[User:Sourcejedi|Sourcejedi]] 20:12, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

==Alienation==
There was a rather good thread in Dreamviews where someone explained that people are likely to associate Lucid Dreaming with &quot;New Age&quot; spirituality (which it is to some extent, particularly in the AP community), and therefore dismiss it out of hand.  Unfortunately the appalling search facility and sheer volume of posts has rendered it lost to me right now, but I think its worth trying to work in the idea somehow - just didn't manage to do it today!

[[User:Sourcejedi|Sourcejedi]] 20:12, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

==Controversial:==
This *needs* cleaning up.  This is the first page in the book, and it doesn't look pretty.

Now the &quot;evil spirits will take over your mind&quot; section doesn't need the tag; yes its controversial, but its clear and explicitly mentioned in the content that this is a matter for your own belief.  Labelling a matter of belief &quot;controversial&quot; is also in questionable taste - I don;t go around calling the belief that Jesus was the Son of God who died for our sins and rose again &quot;controversial&quot;; it is simply a matter of personal belief.

OTOH I can certainly see why the other sections were marked in this way - and why they weren't deleted out of hand.  I'd suggest the way to treat this is as points in an argument about whether its safe to dream lucidly.  I'm not saying the suggestions for help should go (e.g. the point about asking your doctor about meds if you think you've got a problem) - they're good too.  I think most people will find their presence reassuring - that if they did have a problem, they would be able to find help, and its also good to show that we're serious and consider the possibility of harm - though as something which has not been proven.

As humans, we have amazing bodies. Our bodies are made up of many parts that work together to keep us alive. These parts let us to do a lot of things: breathing, thinking, moving, tasting, touching, seeing, hearing, and some other things too. Our bodies can do this because we give it food, water, and air. The point of this book is to help everyone who reads it learn about all about the human body: what it does, what is needs, what it's good at, and what it's bad at.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Of all the emerging technologies and advancements in communication, social networking paired with user created/contributed content is at an all-time high. We have websites like digg.com (one of my faves) that allows you to customize your profile to show you news related to what you are most interested in. Digg offers an easy online community for users to submit stories, photos, videos, etc. 



Digg was founded by former TechTV host Kevin Rose and originally was more tech-geared. Digg has since seen an open market and expanded to allow users to submit news in other categories such as sports, entertainment, politics, etc. Digg's user base is still largely the tech community, so it's a great resource to keep up to date. Stories get voted on and promoted to the &quot;front page&quot;. Once submitted, these stories can be commented on and &quot;dugg&quot;, which is creating a social bookmark.



There are the obvious trendsetters in these communities such as Digg, Deli.cio.us, StumbleUpon, YouTube, MySpace, and Wikipedia just to name a few. Where are the competitors?
In current news...a Wikipedia rival is set for release this week. Citizendium is the new guy on the block. Citizendium was created by Larry Sanger, many would call the co-founder of Wikipedia. What is so great about Citizendium? The questions that are raised by the online community are &quot;Would Wikipedia be better if its contributors fully identified themselves? Would Wikipedia be better if it solicited guidance from academics and other specialists?&quot; Citizendium takes a different approach in attempting to tackle these problems. Content can only be edited by approved editors who have credentials to prove their credibility. Editors/users must also use their real names when submitting and editing. According to sources, &quot;Its volunteer-base numbers roughly 900 authors and 200 editors. The site has 1,100 articles, with 11 'approved' by editors.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Acute Arterial Occlusion ==


It happens when a embolus, most often from cardiac source, impacts in the arterial tree or when there is a local thrombosis, usually at the site of a atherosclerotic plaque or in patients with coagulation disturbance.

==Signs and Symptoms ==

The main symptom is pain on the affected limb, it usually has a sudden onset, but may become worse with time. In patients with previously stenosis the first symptom may be only a worse or new onset of claudication.

The affected limb is also cold, pulseless e pallor. Peripheral nerves injury is usually an early manifestation, starting with numbness evolving to completely motor and sensitive deficit.

Patients who are seen very soon may complain of pain localized where the occlusion occurred, it may helps in the therapeutic approach.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis is usually made in clinical basis only. Image exams help to localize the site of obstruction, the extent of thrombosis and the source of embolus.

The main differential diagnosis are severe deep venous thrombosis (Phlegmasia) and compartimental syndrome.

==Classification==

Acute arterial occlusion is classified in clinical basis only.

Class I: Minor symptoms, limb is warm and no neurologic damage has occurred.
Class II: Classic symptoms of acute limb ischemia, some neurologic damage, the limb must be viable.
Class III: Complete neurologic damage, extensive skin necrosis. The limb is not viable.

==Treatment==

Except in cases where aortic dissection is a possibility, the initial treatment is anticoagulation. It helps to prevent clot propagation and lets internal fibrinolitic system acts.

Class I: No urgent treatment is necessary, the patient may be treated as a cladicant.

Class II: Urgent revascularization is necessary.

Class III: Amputation is the only treatment to be considered.

I think that the history (especially the version history) should be more friendly and contain more historical and background information. And the actual features lists should be moved (after a good revision) to some kind of appendix. As it is now, new Java programmers, I think, can get confused by all those Java details. [[User:Untrots|Untrots]] 22:08, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
:The history is more flowing than before and information is more readily available. Information is cited. However, I'd have to do something about the version history. I think a simple table would be enough. And then all the version specifications can be kept in separate pages in an appendix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''QPNC-PAGE'''

Quantitative Preparative Native Continuous PolyAcrylamide GelElectrophoresis is a technique to isolate active or native metalloproteins (e.g., metal chaperones, prions, metal transport proteins, amyloids, metalloenzymes, metallopeptides) in biological samples and to resolve properly and improperly folded metal cofactor-containing proteins in complex protein mixtures.

== Gel Characteristics ==
The gel is polymerized for a time period of 69 hr at room temperature to fully-polymerize it. That results in a gel which is homogeneous, mechanically stable and free of monomers or radicals. Therefore, the interactions of the gel with the biomolecules can be neglected. The separated metalloproteins are not dissociated into apoproteins and metal cofactors. Highly purified metalloproteins can be isolated in quantitative amounts from different PAGE fractions. The active structures or conformation of the isolated proteins do not change by using QPNC-PAGE.

== Electrophoresis Buffer ==
The buffer used for electrophoresis contains 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and has a pH 10. Due to the specific properties of the gel and buffer solution, most proteins in the sample are charged negatively and migrate from the cathode to the anode in the electric field. Although the pH value (pH 10.00) of the electrophoresis buffer does not correspond to a physiological pH within a cell or tissue, the proteins are eluted continuously  by a physiological buffer solution (pH 8.00) and isolated in different fractions. The separation system including the electrophoresis chamber and a fraction collector is cooled in a refrigerator at 4°C.

== Identification and Quantitation ==

Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pd, Co, Fe, Mn, Pt, Cr, Mo and other metal cofactors can be identified and quantified by ICP-MS. Because of high purity and optimized concentration of the separated metalloproteins in specific PAGE fractions, the related structures of these analytes can be elucidated by using solution NMR spectroscopy under non-denaturing conditions.

== Applications ==

QPNC-PAGE combined with biological mass and NMR spectrometries provide valuable information about the metabolisms of important metal cofactors in biological systems and the proper folding of metallochaperones in conformational diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's or related diseases). The quantitative analysis of metallochaperone proteins in biofluids (e.g., blood, cerebrospinal fluid) helps in the clinical investigations concerning the structure-function relationships of biologically-active metal cofactor-containing chaperones in those protein-misfolding diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are different words for newspaper in Dutch. In the Netherlands the word '''krant''' is used. In the Dutch provinces North-Brabant, Limburg and in Belgium '''Gazet''' or '''Gazette''' is used. Another word is '''Courant''' or in Afrikaans, the variant in South Africa and Namibia, written as  '''Koerant'''. A '''Dagblad''' is a daily paper and a '''Weekblad''' comes once per week.

These examples of papers which are also online are very practical to learn reading Dutch.

''' A General Guide to Trouble Shooting - 
'''Starting'''''' 
 

contributed by author: doclockwood...700S rider/revivifyer)

HI, it looks like there's a lot of Nighthawk starting issues (on the list) right
now. No doubt, it's mostly from all the winterized bikes coming out of
hibernation and from plain old gettin' old, the bikes, I mean. If we
have some common tips for starting woes, we could all post 'em to the
same page and maybe save someone a little time and work by
looking for help (t)here. Many many thanks to all who contribute. 

Anyway, I have had my share of starting trouble lately, (I sure have a lot to learn about starters) but if there's one thing I'd check first, it would be:

1) Clean the grounds to frame and engine. Shine 'em up, coat 'em w/ something or
other(not biting on THAT one...dielectric grease) and then follow up by cleaning all the
contacts in the starting/charging circuit. Test 'em all with an Ω meter (couldn't &quot;resist&quot;)
and a manual. This includes the kill switch and starter button.

2)  Make absolutely sure there's a fully charged battery. It may be
necessary to buy a new one every season but that would indicate a
charging issue. Even if it's just recently charged, it may lose it's
cranking ability after just a few seconds when you hit the start button
due to the age/inefficiencies of other components. Take a jump from a
car and see if it's appreciably stronger(faster spinning starter) than
the bike alone. Cleaner contacts and a &quot;known&quot; strong battery work wonders.

3) Install new plugs and wires. This makes an easier path for the battery
juice...new plugs every oil change, even if the bike is running great?
I dunno...to each his/her own. But it eliminates a variable if it won't start...new
plugs can't hurt.

4) A rusty tank? [[Honda_Nighthawk_Owners_Repair_and_Maintenance_Guide/6.1_Petcock/fuel_valve|Bad petcock?]] Got to be clean. And use fresh gas...my suspicion
is that Sta-bil may inhibit restarting in the Spring for folx above the 
Mason-Dixon line...good stuff to keep the water out of the gas tank, but makes
for hard starts initially. Another rookie mistake is to use Stabil in the 
tank but turn off the bike before it's had a chance to get all the way into 
the carbs and pistons...I'm certainly guilty of this one.

5) [[Honda_Nighthawk_Owners_Repair_and_Maintenance_Guide/13_Carburetor_Cleaning|Carbs need to be clean]], too. Just from the numerous posts on this
topic, it's likely the carbs will gum up or clog sometime during your
watch so it has to be considered a chronic problem for Nighthawks, esp.
the older models. Lo-speed jets need attention here. Bad idle indicates clogged 
jets, but it may be electrical, too. 

6) The starter should be in good condition. It seems like a no-brainer, but if all the above conditions are favorable, then a bad starter may be the problem. No duh, right?:)
There are eBay starters out there and folk who refurbish them, so don't despair. 
 
7) If the starter sounds good/performs well and the bike STILL doesn't start,
it MAY be a bad coil, though it's a long shot. My bike was firing on cyls
2 and 4 only so I suspected the 1-4 coil as bad, but it was just a
cruddy ground. A meter will confirm coil health. 

Lots more tips are in the troubleshooting section in the NH 700S manuals in
ignition/starting sections.

==Forces of the Centrifuge==

===Centripetal Force===
A [[Wikipedia:en:Centrifuge|centrifuge]] works by spinning mixtures around a central axis (centrifugal force).  As the sample spins the tendency of the [[Wikipedia:en:Inertia|inertia]] of the object is to move in a straight-line path.  However, due to its confinement within the centrifuge, the path of the object must be bent into a circular one. The body of the centrifuge, or the body of the container within the centrifuge, provides a normal force that pushes the object toward the center of the circular path of travel. This inward force is refered to as a [[Wikipedia:en:Centripetal force|centripetal force]], and its magnitude and direction are exactly what is needed to keep the object moving in a circular path around the axis of rotation of the centrifuge.

===Centrifugal Force===
The strength of the outward force exerted by an object (due to its inertia trying to move it in a straight-line path) as it moves in a circle at a constant angular velocity depends on the angular velocity and the radius of rotation.  This force is denoted F, the angular velocity is measured in radians and denoted as w, and the radius of rotation, r, is measured in centimeters.

      &lt;math&gt;F = mw^2r&lt;/math&gt;

Usually, the value cited for the force applied to a suspension of particles during the centrifugation is a relative one, that is to say it is compared with the force that the earth's gravity would have on the same particles.  This is referred to as relative centrifugal force (RCF).  It was [[Wikipedia:en:Galileo Galilei|Galileo Galilei]] (1564-1642) who first systematically and scientifically investigated gravity as a natural phenomenon. The gravitational acceleration constant is customarily assigned the symbol &quot;g&quot; and for simplicity taken to be 9.80 m/sec sec.  Based on this measure, relative centrifugal force is expressed as:

   &lt;math&gt;RCF = mw^2r/9.80&lt;/math&gt;        (RFC = F centrifugation / F gravity)

The common way of denoting the operating speed of a centrifuge is in “revolutions per minute” or rpm.  The formula above may be converted so that this relationship expressed as such.  If you are expressing the radius in cm then the formula for RCF is:

     &lt;math&gt;RCF = 11.17r (RPM/1000)^2&lt;/math&gt;

If you are expressing the radius in inches then the formula for RCF is:

     &lt;math&gt;RCF = 28.38r (RPM/1000)^2&lt;/math&gt;


The [[Wikipedia:en:Centrifugal force|centrifugal force]] created by the spinning of the centrifuge is greater at the bottom of the tube (away from the central axis) and less at the top of the tube (closer to the central axis).  This difference is almost twofold.  Because denser items have a greater mass, this causes their centripetal force to be greater (F=ma), and the overall result is that they settle near the outside of the circular path.  This places denser objects at the bottom of a test tube that has been run in a centrifuge.  Less dense objects remain closer to the center of the path, or the top of a test tube that has been run in a centrifuge.

====The Action of Centrifugal Force on Molecules ====
As samples spin in a centrifuge the particles in each sample are subjected to centrifugal force.  However, this force is proportional to the mass of the particle.  To express the centrifugal force applied to a particular molecule its molecular weight (M) is used in the formula:

       Centrifugal force = &lt;math&gt;Mw^2r&lt;/math&gt;
  
Because weight takes into account the force of gravity, using molecular weight in the formula for centrifugal force removes the need to divide by the force of gravity as shown above.  This formula shows how particles within a centrifuge are separated based on their molecular weight.  In addition to this the size and shape of a particle also affects its migration in the gradient created by centrifugation.  For example, plasmid DNA will travel farther down a gradient then chromosomal DNA.  This is the result of the counteracting forces of [[Wikipedia:en:Buoyancy|buoyancy]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Friction|friction]] counteracting the force of centrifugation.

===Buoyancy and Friction===
While the centrifugal force acts to accelerate a particle away from the axis of rotation, the particle is also subjected to additional forces including the force of [[Wikipedia:en:Buoyancy|buoyancy]] and the force of [[Wikipedia:en:Friction|friction]].
*'''Buoyancy force''' refers to the interaction of the molecule within the solvent.  It is calculated as the centrifugal force multiplied by the volume of solvent the molecule displaces (V, the “partial specific volume”) and by the density of the solvent itself (rho – r).  Together this gives the formula:
    Buoyant force = Mω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;rVρ

*As the particles move through the solvent '''frictional force''' is also generated.  The size and shape of a molecule are determinates in the measure of this force.  These contribute to the rate of sedimentation which is expressed as the change in the axis of rotation over time (dr/dt).  This force combines with the Buoyant force to counteract against the centrifugal force. 
  Frictional force = f(v) = f(dr/dt)
The final result of these forces acting together is that a particle will move through the solvent, away from the axis of rotation, until the centrifugal force is equivalent to the forced of buoyancy and friction.  Using the formulas above the '''sedimentation coefficient (s)''' can be calculated from the molecular weight of a particle.
  Sedimentation Coefficient (s) = M(1-Vr)D/RT
  (R is equal to the gas constant 
   T is equal to absolute temperature)
The sedimentation coefficient of a molecule describes where it will settle in a gradient with the viscosity and density of water under centrifugation and is measured in seconds.  For biological molecules these values range between 1 – 500 x&lt;math&gt;10^{-13}&lt;/math&gt; seconds.  Instead of using &lt;math&gt;10^{-13}&lt;/math&gt;, this number is described as one Svedberg unit (S) after [[Wikipedia:en:Svedberg|Theodore Svedberg]]; so that 12x&lt;math&gt;10^{-13}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed as 12S.

===Coriolis Force===
In addition to centrifugal force, particles in suspension (and the body of suspending fluid itself) within a spinning rotor are subjected to Coriolis force.
The Coriolis force which results from the inertia of the liquid and the suspended particles, is a small force directed at the right angles to both the axis of rotation clockwise.  This force acts to deflect particles in a counterclockwise direction (and vice versa).Under nearly all experiment conditions, the coriolis force is very small in comparison with the centripetal force; however, its effects are magnified when the rotor's speed changes (e.g during acceleration and deceleration).
While the centrifugal force acts to accelerate a particle away from the axis of rotation, the particle is also subjected to additional forces including frictional force, the force of buoyancy and gravitational force.

==Centrifuge – the Machine== 
The basic design of a centrifuge consists of a [[Wikipedia:en:Rotor|rotor]] which holds samples and rotates around a fixed axis driven by a motor (in modern centrifuges).   More advanced centrifuges may also have lubrication and cooling systems.  In addition to this, some centrifuges are capable of creating a vacuum environment around the rotor. 

===Rotors===
[[Image:Rotor.JPG|J-lite Series Rotor and lid]]

The most popular and widely used centrifuge rotors are the swinging-bucket and fixed-angle rotors.  Two other types of rotors are the vertical rotor and the zonal rotor.

*Fixed-angle (or angle head) rotors are generally simpler in design than are swinging-bucket rotors. In this type of rotor, the centrifuge tubes are held at a specific and constant angle to the horizontal plane that is the tube does not reorient between the vertical and horizontal positions.  This type of rotor works very well for simple pelleting centrifugation but has limited and variable success in rate-zonal sedimentation and isopycnic sedimentation respectively.  

*Swinging-bucket rotors are able to pivot within the centrifuge.  As speeds increase the angle of the rotor perpendicular to the axis of rotation also increases, positing it in a horizontal configuration.  Conversely, as the centrifuge slows down the rotor returns to a vertical position.  When the bucket swings out the pathlength is increased allowing for improved separation of individual particles, particularly in density gradient centrifugation.  This type of rotor is inefficient when used for pelleting.  However, it is good for use with both rate-zonal and isopycnic sedimentation.
Most swinging-bucket rotors are interchangeable so that different size test tubes can be used.  Additionally, some have the ability to hold multiple test tubes in a single arm.

[[Image:Swinging-bucket rotor.JPG|Interchangeable Swinging-bucket rotor]] [[Image:Multi-sample rotor.JPG]]



*Vertical rotors hold samples in a vertical position within the centrifuge. This type of rotor is not suitable for pelleting centrifugation but it does a good job when used for rate-zonal sedimentation, and an excellent job with isopycnic sedimentation.

===Centrifuge Tubes===
Depending on the sample/ rotor size and speed of centrifugation different types of centrifuge tubes can be used.  Proper selection of centrifuge tubes helps to ensure that leakage does not occur and none of the sample is lost, the chemical properties of the sample and the tube do not conflict, and that the sample can be recovered with little effort.    

[[Image:Centrifuge tubes.JPG]]

====Rotor and Tube Materials====
Early rotors such as the Svedberg rotors were made of steel and occasionally brass.  The high density of these materials and the resulting high rotor weight produces an appreciable load on the centrifuge drive and significantly limits operating speeds.
Most commercial rotors are now made of the partly or entirely of aluminum or titanium.

===Lubrication and Cooling Systems===
The high speeds at which centrifuges operate generate a great deal of frictional force.  Along with this friction comes heat.  To prevent damage to the centrifuge and/or samples within the centrifuge, many present day centrifuges have lubrication and cooling systems to combat friction and the heat it produces.  

Convection occurs whenever uniform suspensions of particles are sedimented in a conventional centrifuge.  The term &quot;convection&quot; means the bulk movement of solute and/or solvent within the centrifuge tube.  Unwanted convection can be caused by variations in temperature in different parts of the centrifuge.  By controlling the temperature, lubrication and cooling systems help to guard against this. 

===Superspeed vs. Ultraspeed Centrifuges===
There are two basic types of preparative centrifuges; superspeed centrifuges and ultraspeed centrifuges or [[Wikipedia:en:Ultracentrifuge|ultracentrifuges]].

*Superspeed centrifuges generally operate at speeds up to about 20,000 rpm.  These centrifuges usually do not require evacuation of the rotor chamber, and drive the rotor directly to through belts or gears.  The picture below is of a Sorvall RC-5B refrigerated superspeed centrifuge.

[[Image:Superspeed centrifuge.JPG]]


*Ultracentrifuges can be operated at much greater speeds (up to 65,000 or 75,000 rpm). Due to these high speeds the rotor chamber must be evacuated of air to reduce friction and permit accurate rotor temperature control.  In most ultracentrifuges the rotor is driven either by a motor and a set of gears or by an oil or air turbine system. the picture below is of a Beckman Coulter optima LE-80K ultracentrifuge.

      <comment>Noted possibly incorrect statements on the history on the centrifuge</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Slight type that needs to be corrected on svedberg picture. -Jfb4497


----

This account seems to contain some incorrect statements. As far as I've been able to find, centrifuges have been used since the mid 1800s, not the mid 1400s. Moreover, Friedrich Miescher did not use a centrifuge to isolate nucleic acids. See the following excerpt on the work of Miescher from &quot;DNA pioneers and their legacy&quot; quoted on http://www.fmi.ch/members/marilyn.vaccaro/ewww/dna.pioneer.excerpt.htm

&quot;After filtration to get rid of tissue fibers, the cells were left to sediment to the bottom of the beaker; laboratory centrifuges were nonexistent in those days. When examined in the microscope, the leucocytes seemed intact and showed no sign of damage.&quot;

==What does a heart look like?==
[[Image:Diagram_of_the_human_heart_%28cropped%29.svg|300px|right|thumb|Diagram showing the parts of a human heart.]]
The heart is about the size of a person's clenched fist. It is made of [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#muscle|muscle]].
It is a muscular organ.

==What are the parts of the heart?==

The heart has two sides: the left side and the right side. Each side of the heart is divided into two parts, called the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#atrium|atrium ]] and the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#ventricle|ventricle]]. The atrium is the top part. The ventricle is on the bottom.

Both sides of the heart have a blood vessel (a vein) through which blood flows into the atrium. Valves are like doors that control where blood goes. Valves separate the atrium from the ventricle. Another set of valves controls the flow of blood from the ventricle to the artery that sends blood back into the body.

The heart is a big muscle that builds up blood pressure by contracting. When the heart contracts, it squeezes or pumps blood throughout the entire body. This is the &quot;beating&quot; of your heart.

=== Right heart ===
The vein leading to the right atrium is called '''vena cava'''. It has the blood returning from all parts of the body (without oxygen). The '''right ventricle''' pumps the blood through the '''pulmonary artery''' to the lungs to get oxygen.

=== Left heart ===
Blood with fresh oxygen returns from the lungs through the '''pulmonary vein''' and flows into the '''left atrium'''.  The '''left ventricle''' pumps the blood into the artery called the '''aorta'''. It supplies the whole body except the lungs with blood.

==What is the function of the heart?==

The heart is the strongest muscle in the body. The heart is a '''pump''' that pumps blood to different organs of the body.

Blood is the medium that carries gases, liquids, nutrients, and [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#waste|waste]] all over the body. It is red in color because of the red blood [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#cell|cells]]. Blood also contains white blood cells which defends the body against [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#disease|diseases]] and makes repairs to damaged tissues.

The heart moves the blood (with the oxygen, nutrients, water, and waste) to and from all parts of the body.

==How does the heart beat?==

Before each beat, your heart fills with blood. Then its muscle contracts to squirt the blood along. When the heart contracts, it squeezes — try squeezing your hand into a fist. That is like what your heart does so it can squirt out the blood. Your heart does this all day and all night, all the time.

==What organ system(s) is the heart connected with?==

The heart is part of the '''circulatory system'''. Its main job is to move blood from the '''lungs''' to all other parts of the body and back. In the lungs, the blood gets oxygen from the air you breathe and leaves waste to be breathed out.

==How does the heart interact with other parts of the body?==

Blood with fresh oxygen is pumped through the body through tubes called '''arteries'''. Arteries divide up into smaller and smaller blood vessels. Finally, tiny blood vessels called capillaries deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells. Then carbon dioxide and waste products are absorbed in the blood. The blood then returns to the right heart through blood vessels called '''veins'''. From the right heart, blood is pumped through the lungs where carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is absorbed to re-oxygenate the blood. From the lungs, the blood returns to the left heart where the cycle begins all over.

Note:
* Blood vessels leaving the heart are called arteries. (You can remember this by thinking of &quot;a&quot; for &quot;away&quot; from the heart.)
* Blood vessels entering the heart are called veins.
* All arteries contain oxygenated blood except the pulmonary artery which sends blood to the lungs. 
* All veins contain de-oxygenated blood except the pulmonary vein which moves blood from the lungs to the left heart.

==How can you keep your heart healthy?==

You can have a healthy heart by:
* getting appropriate exercise
* eating healthy food (a balanced diet)
* controlling high blood pressure

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chapter 16: Verses 1-4 ==
In the beginning of this chapter, Jesus warns his disciples that they can expect much persecution.  He does this to keep his disciples from having unrealistic expectations.  His advanced warning is intended to keep his followers from questioning their faith when things start to happen and, most of all, to keep defections at a minimum (Smith 291).  &quot;They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God&quot; (John 16:2).  &quot;Ejection from synagogues was a significant threat intended to discourage belief in Jesus as the Messiah&quot; (291).  The power behind such an ejection was communal.  The synagogue was a very important form of community organization that was paramount to Jewish social and public life.  To be effectively cast-out of your own synagogue represented therein an ejection from the community.  After relating the cruel and harsh reality that was to come, Jesus reminds his disciples that his coming absence is reason enough for this warning.  Jesus is once again foreshadowing his coming death at the hands of the Jewish authorities.

Jesus foretells to the disciples what will happen to them after the Romans decide the Christians are a threat and the Jews reject them from the synagogue.  He tells them about the persecutions they will face in the future and the pain they will endure for their faith in him.

==Chapter 16: Verses 5-16 (The Work of The Paraclete (a pneuma/angel different from the pneuma/angel that was in Jesus. The angel in Jesus was the angel of Wisdom. The angel for believers is called the angel of the Truth.)==
In this portion of John Chapter 16, Jesus describes the work of the paraclete; The &quot;Spirit of '''the''' Truth.&quot;  First, Jesus addresses the question the disciples have not asked: Where is Jesus going?  The peculiarity of this remark comes with a glance back to Chapter 14, where Peter has already asked this very question.  Could the text be read in a different arrangement?   Jesus goes on to answer his own question, saying that he will be with the Father.  He says this to console them in their grief at his leaving, also, in his stead he promises   consolation through the Spirit of '''the''' Truth.  The Spirit of '''the''' Truth has a mission to help followers remember all the words Jesus spoke, to teach them the meaning of the parables and difficult sayings he spoke, to clarify the prophecies of his return,  to help them understand the doctrines of sin, and righteousnes and give them a right understanding of Satan and his ongoing destruction. This spirit cannot be God or a third person in God for it has severe limitations. It is not allowed to speak its own thoughts, but only what it hears. It is merely a messenger (agellos-angel)

Essentially, the spirit of the truth may be regarded as a conduit to God's enlightenment of believers, who will then enlighten the world.  In 16:12-13, Jesus says, &quot;I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them (comprehend them) now.  When the Spirit of '''the''' Truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth (that Jesus taught).&quot;  These verses identify the Paraclete as the medium of those encounters.  In verse 16, Jesus has used the expression &quot;a little while&quot; to speak of his departure which limits his time in the present (referring to the time leading up to Jesus' death).  &quot;A little while&quot; in the farewell discourse also seems to refer to the time between Jesus' death and  his resurrection.

Jerome translated Paraclet as advocate. However, the paraclete is not a defense lawyer but a prosecutor, so advocate is not the correct word. It convicts the world of sin, so comforter is also not the right word.

Some try to say that it is the return of Jesus in spirit form but that would make verses 13, 14 and 15 quite confusing if you see the paraclete as  &quot;surrogate for Jesus himself.&quot; The paraclete is a pneuma/angel sent to illuminate the words of Jesus.  Just as Jesus received a pneuma at his baptism to help him, all believers who ask for it will receive the paraclete to help them. 

 Verses 13-15 state, &quot;When the Spirit of '''the''' truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth (taught by Jesus); for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come (the return of Jesus not a road map of the future).  He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you.  All that the Father has is mine.  For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.&quot;  If the Spirit is able to &quot;speak whatever he hears,&quot; he is a separate entity from Jesus.

Another interesting characteristic of verse 14 and 15 is this idea of the Spirit &quot;declaring&quot; things to the disciples.  It is not entirely clear just how this declaration will come about or what form it is to take.  However, as D. Moody Smith points out in his commentary on John, there are some suggestions found elsewhere in the New Testament that might shed some light on the mystery.  In 1 John 4:1-3 you have a christological test to determine false spirits from true ones, &quot;1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can recognize a Spirit from God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus  the messiah was real human is from God, 3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge that is not from God. 

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.&quot;

To say that Jesus was God in the flesh means Jesus was not a real man like all other men. Or to say he pre-existed means he is not a like all other men.   

To say he was human you must agree he was 100% human with nothing extra. If you add anything to his humanness or take away anything you are teaching the anti-christ doctrines of the Gnostics who said he was man but more than man. Some even say he only appeared to be a man. He only had the &quot;likeness&quot; of human flesh.

==Chapter 16: Verses 17-33 (The Disciples' Grief will Turn to Joy) ==

At the very end of chapter 16 Jesus proclaims to his disciples that an hour is coming where his disciples will all leave and go there own ways, leaving him undoubtedly and utterly alone.  Yet Christ is never alone because the Father is with him, and he tells the disciples all this that when they find themselves all alone and without him, they can turn and find him in spirit.  There will be much suffering in the world but He will get them through it, like always.

'''You believe at last!'''  Christ's words to his disciples in verse 31 raise an interesting point: exactly what does it take for humanity to believe at last?  Christ's disciples had been with Him for the duration of his ministry, and were personal witnesses to many of His miracles.  If these men could not readily accept him, how have many circles of modern Christianity become so &quot;unwavering&quot; in their beliefs?  These circles, which are ironically the most bibliocentric, seem to ignore the doubt and fear evidenced by the Apostles in the Gospels.  This doubt is glazed over in an attempt to assert that these men were rigorously faithful, warping an essential cornerstone of Christianity (that is, doubt) into blind faith.  How has this proven detrimental to spreading the message of Christ in the modern world?



'''Jesus' death and resurrection foretold?'''

Many believe that in verses 16-19 Jesus is speaking to the disciples about his up and coming death and resurrection. This idea would correlate with one of the reoccurring themes in John of Jesus trying to explain to His disciples what was to come. For instance verse 16 states: &quot;A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me.&quot; (NAS) this verse looks very similar to previous verses in the gospel of John. In John 7:33 there is a distinct resemblance in message &quot;Therefore Jesus said, &quot;For a little while longer I am with you, then I go to Him who sent Me.&quot; (NAS) Jesus continually tries to get His disciples to believe in these things He says by performing His many works, but they still do not understand. Jesus has continued to foretell to the disciples of His upcoming death and resurrection in John 12:35, 13:33, and 14:19. 

Verse 17 states: &quot;Some of His disciples then said to one another, &quot;What is this thing He is telling us, 'A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me'; and, 'because I go to the Father'?&quot; (NAS) This verse reiterates verse 5 in the beginning of this chapter where Jesus says: &quot;But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?'&quot; (NAS) Jesus tries to explain where He is going in previous chapters of John as well. For instance, look in John 7:33, 14:12, and 16:10. 

Lastly in verses 18 and 19 it says: &quot;So they were saying, &quot;What is this that He says, 'A little while'? We do not know what He is talking about. Jesus knew that they wished to question Him, and He said to them, &quot;Are you deliberating together about this, that I said, 'A little while, and you will not see Me, and again a little while, and you will see Me'?&quot; (NAS) The disciples still needed some type of validation to understand what Christ was trying to say. This questioning and confusion parallels their confusion in John 6:61 and also in Mark 9:32.  

Even with these parallels in scripture, some also believe that these passages could be a foretelling of the second coming of Christ. To some, this notion seems evident in previous gospels. However, this idea would not precisely fit with the gospel of John since one of the major focuses of this chapter is of Jesus’ teachings and foretelling of His death and resurrection not of the second coming. It is also likely that Jesus is referring to his resurrection because of the time in which John was written, most likely the latest of the Gospels; a time when the expectations of the 2nd coming were wearing thin, and Christianity had to (in some ways) move away from its eschatological theology.

There are two changes in the relationship between the disciples and Jesus that will be a basis of joy for them.  The first change is reflected in their no longer needing to ask Jesus questions (v. 23).  The stuff the disciples have been asking about will become clear once they see the Lord's death and resurrection and receive the help of the Paraclete.  The disciples will have an understanding of Jesus when the Father sends them the spirit/angel of the truth.  The second change will be their sharing in Jesus' work as his friends (vv. 23-24). This is the truth behind Jesus' reference to asking the Father in his name (cf. 14:13; 15:7). They have not asked in his name up to this point because they have not dwelt in him and he has not dwelt in them. This will soon change, and then they will share in the eternal life that Jesus has with the Father (Gospel Communications, 2007).

'''Hacking''' is the art of exploiting computers to get access to otherwise unauthorised information.
Now that the world is using IT systems to gather, store and manipulate important information there is also a need to make sure that data is secure. However, no system is without its problems. ''Holes'' are often present within security systems which, if exploited, allow hackers to gain access to this otherwise restricted information.
This WikiBook aims to give you the information required to think like hackers, so as to be able to secure your systems and keep your information safe.

Hacking and security is a constantly updated and fast moving sector of the computing industry and, as such, it is vital that you are up to date with all the details (including the latest exploits, patches and more).

It is important that hackers also follow the [[Hacking/Introduction/The hacker ethic|Hacker Ethic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is important that hackers follow ''The Hacker Ethic'' in the same way that it is important that police follow their code of conduct.
An abuse of skill within the hacking world causing harm to others.
Remember: It is almost impossible to gain respect at the expense of others.

== The Original Ethic ==
Back when computers just started to reach universities and students had access to open systems, curious users began to show a certain disregard for the rules.  These users would enter areas of the system without authorization, gaining access to privileged resources.  With no Internet and no copies of ''Hacking Exposed'' or ''Security Warrior'' to assist them, they had to figure out how to enter the systems on their own.

Although these young students represented the first hackers, they had no malicious intent; they simply wanted knowledge, information, a deeper understanding of the systems which they had access to.  To justify and eventually distinguish their efforts, the hacking community developed ''The Hacker Ethic'' as a core part of their subculture.  ''The Hacker Ethic'' states two basic principles:

* Do no damage.
* Make no one pay for your actions.

These two principles fall hand in hand.  The original hackers had an intention to learn about the systems they invaded, not to destroy them or steal valuable confidential information.  They wanted to know how they worked, their flaws, their strengths, interesting functions of their design.  They had no authorization; at the time, they made up for this by making a point of neither interfering with anyone's work nor costing anyone any money in the process of exploring the system.

Unfortunately this mantra does not provide a fully effective cover for your actions.  Even disregarding the legal ramifications, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, your actions will have devastating unintentional consequences if not carefully controlled.  Robert Morris created the Morris Worm to gauge the size of the Internet harmlessly; unfortunately, it loaded down the systems it infected due to exponential re-infection, causing tens of millions of dollars of financial damage.  You must always remember to carefully consider the short and long term impact of your actions on any system.

== Today's Ethic ==
Today we need to add one more rule to ''The Hacker Ethic'', a rule that we should have added long ago.  The Morris Worm illustrates why this rule exists, even beyond legality.

* Always get permission ahead of time.

Please remember to ''always get permission before acting''.  Your actions cause a major disruption to the targets you attack.  Networks become slow, servers crash or hang, and you create spurious log entries.  Any institution with a useful IA sector will notice your attack and panic, believing you to have malicious intent; they will invariably expend resources searching for back doors and trying to determine what confidential information you stole.  All of this, even if you don't get caught, demands that you acquire permission ahead of time.

You always have authorization to hack into servers you own; likewise, if you participate in a ''Capture the Flag'' game or as Red Cell in a ''Red vs Blue'' competition, you implicitly have the right to hack into whatever you can get your hands on.  In all other cases, you need to ask the owners of the machines for authorization; you can even ask them to pay for it, selling your services as penetration tests and giving them a comprehensive outline of their network's vulnerabilities and proper mitigation steps to improve their security.  As long as you have permission ahead of time, and you remember the first two rules of ''The Hacker Ethic'', you can do as you please with the network and the affected machines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ugh!

Speaking as someone who's had to teach shell scripting I have to say that there are quite a few parts of text which I think will lead to considerable confusion.

* The environment conflated with process state. A process' file descriptor list and signal handlers, etc, are not considered parts of the &quot;environment.&quot;  I think it's best to think of the environment specifically as the block of memory in which environment variables are stored
* The positional arguments (represented as $1, etc.) are on the command line ... which is usually not thought of as part of the environment.
* The environment is best described as a region of a process' memory which contains a list of name/value settings ... ASCII strings.  It's used by the shell and by many of  the programs run under a shell as a way to store settings which can be specific to a process or to a family of processes.  (In other words its a way for configuration settings to be passed from a parent process to its descendents).
* I find that it helps students understand the environment when I draw a conceptual memory map of a process ... explain the concepts of ''fork()'' and ''execve()'' ... and show how the ''execve()'' replaces ... over-writes all of a process' memory except for the environment.  This leads almost all students to an understanding of why the '''''export''''' command is used to shift variables and their values out of the local heap and into the environment and gives them the insight to understand why environment variables can only be &quot;inherited&quot; and why the cannot be modified by subshells and other sub-processes.
* Explaining a little about the underlying, fundamental, ''fork()''/''exec*()'' model also helps the student understand the most basic command executions on a much deeper level.  They learn that all normal external command execution involves a subshell which ''exec*()''s a program while their shell ''wait*()''s for it to complete.
* As we get into more advanced topics it becomes far easier for them to master concepts such as pipes (which are, after all, an '''inter-process''' communications mechanism --- and thus inherently involve a subshell or other subprocess), the ''exec'' shell command (when used for purposes other than file descriptor manipulation), and from there the concepts in ''eval'' and ''source'' (the . command).

In other words I think that peeling away a little of abstraction layering ... and giving the students a peek at the inner workings of these things builds a solid
foundation on which they can progress more confidently.

(So I need to re-write this section a bit ... but first I wanted to post it here to the discussion to here any dissenting opinions).  [[User:JimD|JimD]] 07:53, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blood is vital for the human body. Without it, none of the other organs or cells of the body could function.

[[Image:Humanbood600x.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Human blood magnified 600 times.]]

==What does blood look like?==

Blood is a liquid. In humans, as with many other animals, oxygenated blood (the blood that is carrying a lot of oxygen) is bright red. De-oxygenated  blood (the blood that has given away most of its oxygen) is a darker shade of red. It is often thought that the blood in veins is blue, but this is not true. It only looks blue through the skin because of the way light moves through the skin.

==What are the parts of the blood?==

Blood is made up of many different things, '''red blood cells''', '''white blood cells''', '''platelets''', and '''plasma'''. These three types of cell are very important and keep the other cells of the body alive and healthy. Also blood is used to send signals in the body since every cell can be reached this way. For example, the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#hormone|hormone]] (a small signalling molecule) [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#insulin|insulin]] tells cells that food is on the way and cells should take up nutrients from the blood. This is the way of cells send each other instructions.

The red blood cells carry gases such as oxygen that are needed for [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#cellular respiration|cellular respiration]].

The white blood cells are part of the immune system and play an active role in fighting [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#infection|infections]] in the body.

The platelets help the blood clot or stick together. If you get a cut or scrape, this helps stop the bleeding. The platelets create a 'mesh' that the red blood cells can clot upon. This prevents the body from losing more blood and helps to keep infection from entering the body.

The blood plasma is an [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#aqueous|aqueous]] substance made up of about 92% water, 8% blood [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#protein|proteins]] and small traces of other substances including:
*Antibodies (for fighting off infections)
*Hormones (chemical messengers used to control many of the body's functions)
*Oxygen (transporting it to other cells)
*Glucose and fats (to feed the body's cells)
*Carbon dioxide (removed from other cells)
*Salts (for maintaining the correct levels of ions in and around cells; when salts dissolve in water, they turn into ''ions'')

==What is the function of the blood?==

In the human body, blood is the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#transport|transport]] system. It allows the body to bring essential things such as nutrients and oxygen from central locations (i.e. The lungs or small intestine) to every part of the body. Blood is circulated all the way around the body many times a minute. It is pumped by the heart. 

===Transport of Oxygen===
One of the most important things that the blood does is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the cells of the body. It is carried inside the red blood cells by a chemical called [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#hemoglobin|''haemoglobin'']]. 

===Transport of Carbon Dioxide===
As cells function, they produce carbon dioxide. If this is left in the cells, they become useless. Fortunately, the blood removes the carbon dioxide from the cells and takes it to the lungs where it can be breathed out of the body.

===Controlling Body Temperature===
The blood is also used to control the temperature of the body. If the body becomes hot (during the summer for example), more blood will flow to the surface of the skin. This cools the body. If the body becomes cold, the blood will be forced to flow deeper inside the body, keeping the body warmer.

==How does the blood interact with other parts of the body?==

Blood is produced in the bone marrow (inside bones). It also gets parts from the liver and kidneys among other body parts. 

Blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart. Blood gets oxygen from the respiratory system and nutrients from the digestive system. Blood flows through the kidneys to be cleaned.

When the blood cells have reached the end of their useful lives, they are broken down in the liver and then put into the urine by the kidneys to get rid of non-reusable parts.  The reusable parts, such as protein and iron, are recycled by the liver.

==What do Arteries, Veins and Cappillaries look like?==

Have you ever taken a look at your wrist recently? Well if you have, you might have noticed some faint red and blue lines running across them. The red ones are called '''arteries'''. They carry blood '''away''' from the heart and transport it to the rest of the body. Meanwhile, the blue ones are called '''veins''' and they carry blood the opposite direction to the artieries - back from the rest of the body to the heart.

Flaming cockroach:  Served at Mexican restaurants.  It is a shot of tequila topped with Bacardi 151, which is lit on fire.

== Hazard ==
Flaming beverages are an obvious fire hazard and should not be attempted by the inexperienced. There have been several cases of injuries from flaming beverages. Always extinguish the flames completely before drinking. Disfiguring second degree burns have been reported on inexperienced drinkers.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome to PHP ==

PHP started off as a collection of Perl scripts used to aid in the maintaining of personal home pages. Hence, it originally stood for &quot;Personal Home Page.&quot;  However, the language has grown into a huge open source initiative, used by thousands of amateur and professional programmers world wide. It now is officially known as &quot;PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor,&quot; which is a recursive acronym. (For some strange reason, open source programmers seem to love recursive acronyms...)

The reason it is known as a preprocessor and not merely as a processor, is due to the fact that the php files are sent by the webserver to the PHP preprocessor to be processed. the resulting HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), is then sent across the internet to the web browser requesting the php page.

PHP has traditionally been used for adding dynamic content onto previously static webpages; however, due to the rapid development of the language, it is now used for writing command line tools, and now has GTK bindings allowing the programmer to write GUI applications!

Since the beginning of version 5 of PHP, with the inclusion of Zend Engine II as PHP's foundation, PHP now can be used to write Object Oriented applications.

You can download PHP free of charge (as it/is an Open Source programming language) from http://www.php.net

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think there are some replicated pages in this book. Some pages are like this: &lt;br/&gt;
Programming:PHP and MySQL:Introduction&lt;br/&gt;
and other like this&lt;br/&gt;
Programming:PHP and MySQL/File Handling

Worst, the inter-page links are also confused causing some page to be replicated. I'll try to look into this and try to resolve the page into using the second type of links, and subpaging. I Hope there is no outside link that points to the deleted page. -- [[User:The Kid|The Kid]] 10:20, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

OK, finished most of everything. I've moved the pages. Note: due to my mistake, I forgot to use the move feature, instead copying them one-by-one. Only the last page is moved properly by the move feature. And when I tried to move the other pages again, with the proper move feature, they can't be moved because there is an article of the same name. Strangely enough, the first and second section's page content went missing. I'll tag the &quot;soon should be deleted&quot; pages with the delete tag, including the missing first and second one. -- [[User:The Kid|The Kid]] 12:34, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

: Instead of outright deleting the duplicate pages, I merged them together to fix the problem and now the old pages redirect to the new names too. I'm going to go ahead and make a few other improvements that I can see, while I got my eye on the book. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:53, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PHP tags: ==

=== '''&lt;?php [code] ?&gt;''' ===
* Enclose PHP code
* Embedded in normal HTML code
* Within PHP tags, statements are separated by a ; (generally also followed by a new line).

Example: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 &lt;?php
 print &quot;Hello World\n&quot;;
 $date = date(&quot;Y-m-d H:i:s&quot;);
 print &quot;The date and time at the moment is $date&quot;;
 ?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Commenting ==

==='''//'''===
Comments out one line

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
echo &quot;Hello&quot;; // Everything from the hash is commented out
&lt;/source&gt;

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
// This entire line is commented out
&lt;/source&gt;

==='''#'''===
Same function as '''//'''

==='''/* (text) */'''===
Comments out everything between the /* and the */

Example: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 /*All of this is
 commented out.
 Even this line!*/
&lt;/source&gt;

== Variables ==
Variables in PHP are denoted by the $ prefix.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $a = “Hello World”; # this assigns the string “Hello World” to $a.
 $b = “$a, I'm Ralfe”; # this assigns “Hello World, I'm Ralfe” to $b.
 $b = $a.”, I'm Ralfe”; # exactly the same as the previous example.
&lt;/source&gt;

PHP supports dynamic variables.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$c = “response”;

$$c = “Hello Ralfe”; # this assigns “Hello Ralfe” to $response.
&lt;/source&gt;


PHP variables do not have to be declared ahead of time, nor do they require a type
definition. PHP handles all data type conversions.

* Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$a = 4;

$b = 12;

print “The value of a is $a.”; # Uses a as a String.

$c = $a + $b; # $a is now used as an Integer again.
&lt;/source&gt;

PHP supports Boolean variables, which can be assigned either a one or a zero, or a
true or false.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$a = true;

$b = 1;  # $a and $b are equal, though not identical.

$c = false;

$d = 0; # $c and $d are equal, though not identical.
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Helpful Definitions: ====
; Equal vs Identical
; Equal : Values are equal in value, but may be of differing types.  Uses == comparison operator.  E.g. false is equal to 0.
; Identical : Values are equal in value and of the same type.  Uses === comparison operator.  E.g. false is identical only to false, it is not identical to 0.

== Operators ==
===Arithmetic Operators===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$a = 4;

$b = 2;

$a + $b = 6;  // Addition

$a - $b = 2;  // Subtraction

$a * $b = 8;  // Multiplication

$a / $b = 2;  // Division

$a % $b = 0;  // Modulus

$a++;  // Increment

$a--;  // Decrement
&lt;/source&gt;

===Assignment Operators===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$a = 4;

$b = $a;

// $b = 4;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Comparison Operators===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$a == $b // test if two values are equal

$a === $b // test if two values are identical

$a != $b // test if two values are not equal

$a !== $b // test if two values are not identical

$a &lt; $b // test if the first value is less than the second

$a &gt; $b // test if the first value is greater than the second

$a &lt;= $b // test if the first value is less than or equal to the second

$a &gt;= $b // test if the first value is greater than or equal to the second
&lt;/source&gt;

== Concatenation ==
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$a = &quot;Fill the halls &quot;;

$b = &quot;with poisoned ivy...&quot;;

$c = $a . $b;  # the '.' operator concatenates two variables.

// $c = &quot;Fill the halls with poisoned ivy...&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Arrays ==
PHP supports both numerically indexed arrays as well as associative arrays.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$a = array(1, 2, 3, 4);

// $a[0] = 1;

// $a[1] = 2;

// $a[2] = 3;

// $a[3] = 4;

$b = array(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Fred&quot;, &quot;age&quot; =&gt; 30);

// $b['name'] = &quot;Fred&quot;;

// $b['age'] = 30;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Decision and Loop Statements ==
===If ... else statement===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $a = 1;
 $b = 10;
 
 if ($a &gt; $b) {
    echo &quot;a is greater than b&quot;;
 }
 else if ($a == $b) {
    echo &quot;a is equal to b&quot;;
 }
 else {
    echo &quot;a is not greater than b&quot;;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // a is not greater than b
&lt;/source&gt; 

===Switch statement===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $a = 100;
 
 switch($a) {
    case(10):
       echo &quot;The value is 10&quot;;
       break;
 
    case(100):
       echo &quot;The value is 100&quot;;
       break;
 
    case(1000):
       echo &quot;The value is 1000&quot;;
       break;
 
    default:
       echo &quot;Are you sure you entered in a valid number?&quot;;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // The value is 100
&lt;/source&gt;

===For statement===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) {
    # initialize $i ; while condition ; increment statement
    echo $i;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // 0123456789
&lt;/source&gt;

===Foreach statement===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $a = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
 
 foreach ($a as $val){
    echo $val;
 }
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // 12345
&lt;/source&gt;

===While statement===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 while ($row = mysql_fetch_row($result)){
    print $row[0];
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

===Do ... while statement===
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $i = 0;
 # Note that it might seem that $i will
 do{
    # never be printed to the screen, but
    print $i;
    # a DO WHILE loop always executes at
 } while ($i &gt;0);
 # least once!
&lt;/source&gt;

== Functions ==
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 function square_number($number) {
    return ($number * $number);
 }
 
 $answer = square_number(10);
 echo &quot;The answer is {$answer}&quot;;
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // The answer is 100
&lt;/source&gt;

== Classes ==
Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 class dog {
    var $name;
    
    function __construct($name){
       $this-&gt;name = $name;
    }
    
    function bark(){
       echo &quot;Woof! Woof!&quot;;
    }
    
    function who_am_i() {
       echo &quot;My name is {$this-&gt;name}, and I am a dog&quot;;
    }
 }
 
 $the_dog = new dog(&quot;John&quot;);
 $the_dog-&gt;who_am_i();
 
 // OUTPUT:
 // My name is John, and I am a dog
&lt;/source&gt;

As of PHP 5.3.3, functions with the same name as the class will no longer act as a constructor.  Versions prior to 5.3.3 the &lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;function __construct($name)&lt;/source&gt; line could be replaced with &lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;function dog($name)&lt;/source&gt; to achieve the same effect. &lt;ref&gt;http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Series of Questions==
Could we scrap the line &quot;Modules will focus only on answering a specific series of questions plus about the subject&quot; from the project description? I don't feel that an appropriate set of questions could be formulated that would be usable for every module, for example, the same question could not be used for the eyes as for the blood. If the same questions were used big gaps would appear in the comprehensiveness of the modules. [[User:Urbane User|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urbane User&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Urbane User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Urbane_User|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:28, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

: I respect your opinion on that. What we have done in the past is change the questions somewhat to suit the topic. I think the questions help to keep consistency in the modules and give us an idea of the relative completeness of each module/article. I think that they aid the development process and help to attract new users in th early development process. Certainly I don't object to changing the text of that particular passage to something a little more open-ended. What are your thoughts? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:43, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

: Great start on the article on blood, BTW. Nicely written. :) --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:47, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

:: The worst thing about that sentence was that it didn't make any sense. ;) I have rephrased. If you still don't like it, use your best judgment and fix it. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:59, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

::: Sorry i was unable to answer your previous question, i didnt get a chance to log n yesterday afternoon. Thanks for taking my suggestions on board, I think the new rephrased sentence is great. And thanks for the support on the blood article. It is very much appreciated.

==Content Organization==
It seems to make sense to organize this book with body systems as chapters and organs as pages under those. As an example, DigestiveSystem would be a chapter. Stomach, SmallIntestine, and LargeIntestine would be pages under that. The current pages are not named that way. Should we reorganize? If so, what is the process for doing that? Also, is there a TOC for this book? It might be easier to flesh out with that as an outline. I am happy to write that if that makes sense. [[User:Kfasimpaur|Kfasimpaur]] 23:42, 31 May 2007 (UTC) [[User talk:kfasimpaur|talk]]

==General look and original artwork==
Some nice articles underway here but many of the illustrations for example from Greys anatomy anno 1918 may not seem appealing to kids. Perhaps I have a somewhat prejudice view of what kids may appreciate but I would imagine more colorful images would be popular? I wish I could make it happen but unfortunately I'm not that great at drawing...

== Updating Development Stages ==

Since these haven't been updated in a while i think that while we are editing the pages we should change the development to what we think it deserves. Whether that be lowering or raising it's level. I would like to receive some feedback on what you think we should change. Thanks. 

Also what do you think we should consider doing about the ears section. It seems like most of what has to be said about the ear, has been written. That said do you think we should update the development considering there is only so much we can talk about and it isn't a lot?</text>

==Differential Centrifugation==
[[Wikipedia:en:Differential centrifugation| Differential Centrifugation]] is a process involving multiple centrifugation steps, increasing the speed of centrifugation each time, used to separate cellular materials.  This process uses a equilibrium density gradient.  The mixture of cellular materials (known as [[Wikipedia:en:Homogenization|homogenate]]) is separated into different layers based on the molecular weight, size, and shape of each type of molecules.  Subsequent rounds of centrifugation will pellet first the nuclei, followed by the mitochondria, then the lysozomes, and finally the microsomes.  The soluble fraction of the homogenate is what remains after these materials have been removed.  To begin proteomics research focused on proteins found in one of the various differential fractions, that particular layer would first be isolated and collected and then further purification/experimentation can be carried out.  A protocol for membrane protein extraction using multiple rounds of centrifugation at varying speeds can be found at http://www.westernblotting.org/protocol%20membrane%20extraction.htm .

==Differential Fractions==

Each fraction obtained is a partially-pure preparation from which contaminating particles can be removed by repeated washing.  This is accomplished by first resuspending the pellet in an isotonic solvent and then re-pelleting using centrifugation.  To purify the sample further is may then be separated using [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Centrifugation/Density Gradient Centrifugation|density gradient centrifugation]].

====Nuclear Fraction====
The [[Wikipedia:en:Cell nucleus|nuclear]] fraction of the homogenate can be pelleted by centrifugation at 600g for 10 minutes.  This fraction will contain all material found in the nucleus including genomic DNA, proteins involved in replication and transcription, as well as other nuclear proteins and materials.
[[image:biological_cell.svg|thumb|350px|Schematic of typical animal cell, showing subcellular components. [[Wikipedia:en:Organelle|Organelles]]: (1) [[Wikipedia:en:nucleolus]] (2) [[Wikipedia:en:cell nucleus|nucleus]] (3) [[Wikipedia:en:ribosome|ribosome]] (4) [[Wikipedia:en:vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[Wikipedia:en:endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Wikipedia:en:Golgi apparatusGolgi apparatus]] (7) [[Wikipedia:en:CytoskeletonCytoskeleton]] (8) smooth Endoplasmic reticulm (9) [[Wikipedia:en:mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[Wikipedia:en:vacuole|vacuole]] (11) [[Wikipedia:en:cytoplasm|cytoplasm]] (12) '''lysosome''' (13) [[Wikipedia:en:centriole|centrioles]]]]

====Mitochondrial Fraction====
The [[Wikipedia:en:Mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] fraction of the homogenate  is obtained in the pellet when the post-nuclear supernatent (i.e. the supernatent of the first centrifugation ) is centrifuged at 5000g for 10 minutes.  The mitochondria are sometimes called the “power house” of the cell because of their role in energy production.  Mitcohondria also have their own DNA unique from that which is found in the nucleus.  Proteins of interest found in the mitochondria would be those involved in the conversion of organic materials into ATP through oxidative phosphorylation.

====Lysosomal Fraction====
The [[Wikipedia:en:Lysosome|lysosomal]] fraction can be pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000xg for 5 minutes.  Lysozomes contain important proteins for breaking down cellular waste.

====Microsomal Fraction====
The [[Wikipedia:en:Microsome|microsomal]] fraction is the pellet pellet produced when the postmitochondrial supernatent is centrifuged at 50,000g for 60 minutes.  Microsomes are small vesicles enclosed by a biological membrane.  During centrifugation the endoplasmic reticulum is fragmented into microsomes.

==== Soluble Fraction==== 
The soluble fraction of the homogenate is the supernatant that remains after the other materials have been pelleted out in previous rounds of centrifugation.  Within this fraction soluble proteins are found.  To further isolate/purify proteins found here a different method of centrifugation can be used, such as [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Centrifugation/Density Gradient Centrifugation|density gradient centrifugation]].  In fact, density gradient centrifugation can be used to further separate any of the fractions collected by differential centrifugation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section contains a discussion of the various file manipulation capabilities of '''Asymptote'''. It covers image files outputs, source code includes and data file input and output.

==Image Files==
Image files are created by calling the &lt;tt&gt;shipout&lt;/tt&gt; function.  However, this need not be explicitly included.

==Source Files==
Many useful modules, as discussed in the [[Asymptote]] main page, can be imported using the file import routine; for example:

&lt;tt&gt; import graph.asy; &lt;/tt&gt;

would give access to the numerous graphing functions contained in the file &lt;tt&gt;graph.asy&lt;/tt&gt;.

According to the software documentation (http://asymptote.sourceforge.net), Asymptote will search for module files in the following directories (in order):
#The current directory;
#The directory .asy in the user’s home directory (%USERPROFILE%\.asy under MSDOS);
#A list of one or more directories specified by the configuration variable dir (separated by : under UNIX and ; under MSDOS);
#The Asymptote system directory (by default, /usr/local/share/asymptote under UNIX and C:\Program Files\Asymptote under MSDOS).

The working directory can be changed using the command

&lt;tt&gt; string cd(string ''directory_string''); &lt;/tt&gt;

The return value is the new directory.  If &lt;tt&gt;directory_string&lt;/tt&gt; is an empty string, the system returns to the working directory at startup.  ''Note: the option &lt;tt&gt;-global&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;-unsafe&lt;/tt&gt; must be enabled to change the working directory.''

==Data Files==
Data files can be input and output

==Density Gradient Centrifugation==
The use of density gradients has become almost routine in centrifugal fractionation of particle mixtures and purification of subcellular organelles and macromolecules.  The basic idea behind the [[Wikipedia:en:Differential centrifugation|density gradient]] approach is that the mixture of particles to be separated is placed onto the surface of a vertical column of liquid, the density of which progressively increases from top to bottom, and then centrifuged.  Although the particles in suspension are individually denser than the liquid at the top of the gradient, the average density for the sample (i.e. particles plus suspending liquid) is lower; only under such conditions could the sample zone be supported by the top of the density gradient.  The two main types of density gradient centrifugation are rate-zonal separation and isopycnic separation.

===Rate-Zonal Separation===
In rate-zonal separation, particles are separated based on their size and mass.  This means that they migrate through the gradient according to these properties - which allows their separation into distinct zones or bands, if they were layered as a thin zone onto the top of the gradient.  This is useful in separating out particles with the same or very similar densities, but different sizes or masses: size is a much stronger discriminator than density in determining where particles migrate to in a given time, as sedimentation rate or velocity of a particle in a gravitational field is directly proportional to the density difference, but depends upon the square of the diameter.  

Many proteins and other macromolecules, such as antibodies and virus particles, are isolated in this way.

It is generally the case that rate-zonal separations are dynamic rather than static: that is, if centrifugation is continued long enough, all the zones end up as one pellet at the bottom of the tube.  It is also possible to combine rate zonal and density separations if the greatest density in the tube - for example, 1.04 to 1.23 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for a 10 - 50% (w/v) sucrose gradient - is higher than one particular particle density, but less than the others being separated.

===Isopycnic Separation===
In isopycnic separation the particles migrate through the solvent gradient until they reach the point where their buoyant density is equal to that of the gradient.  This is known as the [[Wikipedia:en:Isopysnic|isopycnic]] point or isodense position.  Once the particles have reached their isopycnic point they will no longer move in the gradient, regardless of how much longer the centrifuge is run for.  An example of this type of gradient is a caesium chloride concentration gradient.  This is a salt that - for example - has a density of 1.08 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for a 10% (w/v) solution, increasing to 1.58 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for a 50% (w/v) solution. It and other heavy metal salts have the problems of being somewhat toxic and exerting a very strong osmotic pressure, as well as chemically affecting certain macromolecules.  There are other, more inert materials better suited to isopycnic or even rate zonal separations, such as [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7978279 iodixanol]: this is a non-ionic polymer which has very low osmolality and is capable of self-forming gradients like the heavy metal salts.  

====Rate vs. Isopycnic Separation: Advantages and Disadvantages====
The choice of whether to try to isolate particles on rate basis or by isopycnic banding should take into account the following points:

*For large particles such as cellular organelles, rate zonal runs are of considerably shorter duration than are isopycnic runs. This can be an important consideration where prolonged particle viability or liability are questionable.

*Rate zonal runs are usually carried out in shallower density gradients than are isopycnic runs. Such condition can prove less damaging to particles that are osmotically active.

*Rate zonal runs are usually carried out by using a lower [[Proteomics/Protein Separations - Centrifugation/How the Centrifuge Works|RFC]] than is used in isopycnic runs.  For certain especially fragile particles, the reduced hydrodynamic shear during sedimentation may be an aid in maintaining particle integrity.

*The duration of centrifugation is not as critical in an isopycnic run as in a rate zonal run. To attain isopycnic banding, a certain minimum amount of centrifugation is required, but extending the centrifugation time beyond this does not much alter the results if the sample was layered on top of the gradient.

*Generally speaking, greater numbers of particles can be separated by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation than by rate centrifugation. This is because the density gradients used for isopycnic runs are steeper and more stably support a greater quantity of sample.

==Preparation of Density Gradients ==
Density Gradients are used not only for particle separations in the centrifuge tubes of conventional rotors, but also in special-purpose instruments such as zonal rotors, continuous flow rotors,and stay-put devices .The fundamentals of density gradient preparation are the same in nearly all the applications, but for the time being the discussion will center around gradient generation in tubes. 
Density Gradient may be subdivided into two main categories according to the means of preparation: step gradients and continuous gradients. 

===Step Gradients===
Step Gradients are prepared by successively layering solutions of different density in the centrifuge tube and then layering the sample to be fractionated on top of the last &quot;step&quot;.  Step gradients are sometimes useful in density gradient centrifugation because the abrupt density steps that persist can be used as surfaces onto which particles can sediment during centrifugation.  This results in discrete particle layers at each step.
  
Special density gradient generating equipment is not required for production of step gradients. The gradient may be built up in the centrifuge tubes carefully layering one step on another, beginning with the densest step, by use of a pipette. Alternatively the gradient can be formed beginning with the least dense step by depositing each layer at the bottom of the centrifuge tube through a narrow cannula.

===Continuous Gradients=== 
Continuous density gradients are gradients in which the density changes smoothly and continuously from one limit or extreme to another. Such gradients can be produced from step gradients by allowing sufficient time for diffusion to smooth out the steps, but continuous gradients are normally prepared directly by using special devices known as gradient makers or gradient engines.

===Gradient Materials=== 
For most biological work, the ideal solute used to produce a density gradient should satisfy the following criteria:
 
*The solute should be sufficiently soluble in aqueous media to produce the range of densities needed.
 
*Dissolution of the solute should not result in solutions of high viscosity in the desired density range. Viscous solutions pose special mixing problems for gradient makers and are handled with some difficulty. Moreover, the sedimentation rate of a particle decreases directly in relation to the viscosity of the surrounding medium.
 
*The solute should not exert too high an [[Wikipedia:en:Osmotic pressure|osmotic pressure]] in the desired density gradient range. The size, the shape, and the density of whole cells, membrane-enclosed subcellular organelles, and even macro molecules can be altered as these particles sediment through a density gradient if the osmotic pressure of the surrounding medium changes markedly.
 
*Solutions of the gradient solute should be adjustable to the pH and [[Wikipedia:en:Ionic strength|ionic strengths]] that are compatible with the particles being separated.
 
*The solute should not react with the particles being separated and should not interfere with the methods of analysis of the collected fractions.
 
*Solutions of the gradient solute should exhibit a property that can conveniently be used as a measure of concentration or gradient density.
 
*The solute should be readily removable from the collected gradient fractions (should that be necessary or desirable).
 
*The solute should be affordable in the quantities needed.

==Collecting Fractions== 
At the conclusion of centrifugation, the density gradient and the entangled particle zones are usually removed from the tube (or rotor) and collected as a series of fractions. This may be achieved in several ways. One of the oldest and simplest methods is to puncture the bottom of each centrifuge tube and allow the contents to slowly drip out. The gradient may also be removed by carefully lowering a narrow cannula to the bottom of the tube and withdrawing the gradient by use of a peristaltic pump.  In both procedures the gradient exits the tube dense end first, and thus the separated particles are collected in order of decreasing sedimention rate or density.  A third option is to puncture the tube at the location in the gradient of the material of interest and extract it manually.  For a detailed description of this see the protocol at http://people.rit.edu/rhrsbi/GEPages/LabManualPDF5ed/23%20Plasmid%20Prep.pdf.  The diagram below demonstrates this process in the collection of the plasmid DNA fraction; however, one can see how easily this could be applied to the protein fraction instead.


[[Image:Density_gradient.JPG|Collecting Fraction from a Cesium Chloride Density Gradient]]

==Measuring Gradient Density== 
Since the density of a solution is its mass:volume ratio, measurement of these two parameters in successive aliquots of the collected gradient reveals the gradient's profile. However this approach is awkward and time consuming and is rarely used in connection with density gradient centrifugation. Instead , the refractive index of small drops of liquid taken from different regions of the gradient is determined, and the corresponding densities obtained from tables or curves relating refractive index to density. 

===Light Refraction and Snell's Law=== 
The speed of the light changes as light passes from one medium into another. If the light passes across the interface between the two media at any angle other than 90 degree, the direction of the light is also changed. The refractive index of a substance is a measure of its ability to bend the light and is related to the substance's density.  For more detailed information on this subject see  [[Wikipedia:en:Snell's lax|Snell's law]] at wikpedia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">OpenVAS evolved from Nessus when Tenable put Nessus under a restrictive license.  Tenable had some trouble with people rebranding Nessus as their own product, and unfortunately had to make this move.  As a result, OpenVAS appeared.

OpenVAS resides at [http://www.openvas.org/ http://www.openvas.org/]; the project suffered an infrastructure problem as soon as it opened, but the mailing lists show healthy development activity and the project may very well take off.

:Daar is 'n eie wikiboek vir [[Afrikaans]], hierdie is net 'n vergelyking van die twee tale.
::Er is een eigen wikiboek voor [[Afrikaans]], dit is slechts een vergelijking van de twee talen.
:::[[Afrikaans]] has its own wikibook. This page discusses the relationship between the two sister languages.

==Afrikaans &amp; Nederlands==
Dutch is used in the countries The Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, Netherlands Antilles &amp; Aruba, sometimes in Indonesia and some neighbouring parts of Germany and France. But if you speak Standard Dutch you can also hold conversations very easily in Southern Africa, in South Africa and Namibia.

Since the founding of Kaapstad (Cape Town) in 1652 a variety of Dutch was spoken at the Cape, gradually spreading over much of Southern Africa. Since 1806 the political ties were severed and the spoken languages evolved in their own directions, much as English did in the U.S. and French did in Quebec. Some Dutch dialects and Afrikaans are still very close to each other and the differences between Dutch dialects are at least as big as between Dutch and Afrikaans. In fact, until 1925 there was only one written standard legally recognized both in South Africa and in Belgium and the Netherlands. 

Unfortunately, this written standard was rather artificial and archaic and did not reflect what people actually spoke. For example the standard still had case endings and three genders (masculine, feminine and neuter). Only certain dialects of Flanders and the southern part of the Netherlands still had at least three genders in the spoken language. The northern Netherlands only had two genders and South Africa only one. The inflectional system was already gradually becoming disused in the Middle Ages, but later grammarians decided that it had to be preserved— even brought back— at all costs. On top of that the spoken language of South Africa had a much simplified verbal system, e.g. it no longer used the simple past tense. There were also numerous differences in pronunciation and semantics.

The discrepancies between the single written standard and what people actually spoke were so large that they created serious educational problems and formed an impediment to social progress both in Africa and in Europe.

This was why the Kollewijn spelling (1891) proposed radical changes for the spelling of the language. It is also known as &quot;Schrijf zoals je praat / Skryf hoe jy praat-spelling&quot; (Write-as-you-talk spelling). In South Africa, where the discrepancies were the most conspicuous, his ideas were implemented in the 1920's with considerable vigor.

In the Netherlands and Belgium (and their colonies) his ideas were dismissed as outrageous and iconoclastic. It was also feared that what had been one language would splinter into many, each of which would be unable to compete in the modern world.

In 1925 Afrikaans was officially recognized as a separate language with its own spelling and grammar, much closer to what people actually spoke. In Europe it was only after the Second World War that the educational and political establishment finally threw in the towel and followed the Afrikaans example. In 1947 the spelling was revised in such a way that case endings (notably the '''''-n''''' in the masculine singular accusative: de'''''n''''') were made optional. Rapidly it disappeared from use. Many silent and superfluous letters were omitted, e.g.:

:de menschen wenschen → die mense wens
:de boeken van dien aardigen kleinen jongen → die boeke van die aardige klein jong

The reform of 1947 was not quite as sweeping as the one in 1925.

For example the word for ''at home'' is still written as ''thuis'' (from: te huis) in Dutch, but as ''tuis'' in Afrikaans. Similarly, ''thans'' (from ''te hands'': now) is written as it is pronounced in Afrikaans: tans.

In part the reluctance to reform had to do with the fact that earlier ideas in Flanders to create a separate standard closer to what was spoken there had largely been abandoned. In Belgium the language was under considerable pressure from a French speaking elite and could ill afford further fragmentation. Despite considerable variety in the spoken language there was clearly a desire to keep the written umbrella unified. This led to increased linguistic cooperation between Flanders and the Netherlands and the creation of the Taalunie.

The ties with South Africa in the mean time become all but severed because the Apartheid government there - amongst other things - emphasized the uniqueness of the Afrikaans language. In fact in 1961 all linguistic ties were broken. The Netherlands and Belgium increasingly joined the boycott against apartheid. Since 1994 there is a slow process of renewal of ties but the languages have continued to evolve in different directions in the meantime.

==Inleiding==
'''Afrikaans:''' Afrikaans is een van die elf amptelike tale in Suid-Afrika en is ook die grootste, maar nie amptelike taal nie van Namibië. Afrikaans, 'n betwiste kreool van Nederlands, word gepraat deur 6 miljoen mense in Suid-Afrika as huistaal. Naas die 6 miljoen is daar ook 10 miljoen wat Afrikaans praat as tweede taal, vaak naas Engels, Xhosa of Zoeloe

:'''Let op:''' ''Hierdie mense wat Afrikaans praat is nie alleenlik blanke Suid-Afrikaners van Nederlandse afkoms nie maar word ook gepraat deur die sogenaamde kleurlinge en swart Suid-Afrikaners.''

Tot 1925 het Afrikaans as Nederlands gereken, maar in 1961 het Afrikaans Nederlands offisieel vervang. Tot dié tyd het die mense Afrikaans en Nederlands beskou as sinonieme. Na 1961 heet die taal Afrikaans. Nederlands is oorspronklik die taal van die Nederlandse koloniste, toe die Boere en nou die Afrikaners. Deesdae word die taal deur mense van alle kleure gepraat. Die taal is die meest verspreide taal in Suidelike Afrika en meer as 60% van die Namibiërs kan 'n proffesionele gesprek in Afrikaans voer.

==Introduction==
'''English:''' Afrikaans is one of the eleven official languages in South Africa and also the biggest, but not an official language of Namibia. Afrikaans, a creole of Dutch, is spoken by 6 million people in South Africa as a mother tongue. Beside those 6 million there are also 10 million people that speak Afrikaans as a secondary language, often next to English, Xhosa or Zulu. 

:'''Note:''' ''This is not only the white South Africans of Dutch descent but also the &quot;coloureds&quot; and also many black South Africans.''

It was in 1925 that Afrikaans was recognized as Dutch in South Africa, but in 1961 Afrikaans replaced Dutch officially, till those times it was considered as synonyms. After 1961 the language is called Afrikaans. Dutch was originally the language of the Dutch colonists, later Boers and now Afrikaners. But these days the language is used by people of all colours. The language is the most spread out language in Southern Africa and more than 60% of the Namibians can have a professional conversation in Afrikaans.

==Differences between Dutch and Afrikaans==

===Grammar===

====Verbs====
One major difference between the two languages is that Dutch retains the simple past tense, Afrikaans does not:

:I learn - I learned - I have learned
:ik leer - ''ik leerde'' - ik heb geleerd
:ek leer - ek het klaar geleer - ek het geleer

In the present tense Dutch typically has three forms:

:ik ''leer''
:jij, hij ''leert''
:wij, jullie, zij ''leren''

In Afrikaans there is only one: '''leer'''

====Verb position====


====Negation====

      <text xml:space="preserve">''A house can represent your mind. The cellar might be your subconscious. What does the house look like? Who lives there?''

''Trains and similar vehicles can represent sexuality. Are you on the train, or are you afraid of being hit by one?''

I don't understand both of these - I know that the first one happened in Jung's famous &quot;collective conscious&quot; dream, but I don't see why other people would have the same analogy. The train one I can't see at all. The flying one which I added, however, is fairly obvious - or so I think, anyway.

Here's a nice quote from the ld4all.com forums about this:

: There is no set of standards by which your brain renders images. &quot;Let's see, I subconsciously desire more time with my family, so I'll dream about a horse falling off of a building.&quot; No no no... Come on, people. [http://forum.ld4all.com/viewtopic.php?p=54860#54860]

Kaycee, why these? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 01:10, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: I know about the problems associated with giving &quot;generic interpretations&quot;. However, there are things that most (western) people encounter during their early life, such as living in a house and traveling in a vehicle. I believe these shape the imagery the subconscious uses. The &quot;train entering a tunnel&quot; is a classic Jungian symbol representing penetration.

: Anyway, I understand if you feel that these two examples serve better as anecdotes, not generic guidelines or anything. Feel free to delete/edit.

:: Surely the train entering a tunnel would only appear as pentration if you already know about this Jungian symbol?

:: Also, they would be useless as anecdotes unless a full dream is used. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:44, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)


''It is important to improve your dream recall because it is possible to have a lucid dream without remembering it! It is worth getting your dream recall up to a few dreams per night for exactly that reason.''

It may be just me, but I find this line to be a little silly. How do you know that you can dream lucidly and not remember it if you don't remember it? Hm? ;) --[[User:DarkPhoenix|DarkPhoenix]] 12:31, 23 May 2004 (UTC)

: It is a little silly, but that seems to be the general opinion in the lucid dreaming community. I think there was some experiment that LaBerge did - basically, it was found that eye movements while dreaming correspond to movements in the dream. Therefore, LaBerge could enable dreamers to signal by moving their eyes left-right-left-right (this shows up clearly on the recording equipment). He asked people to do that movement when they became lucid. I think some people did the signal but didn't remember the dream! The simplest conclusion is that they were lucid but forgot about it.
: Anyway, I can forget huge sections of a lucid dream, so why not forget all of it? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 13:39, 23 May 2004 (UTC)

Another thing i do when i recall a dream is finding out why something happened.
Was it because i expected/wanted it to happen or did it happen naturally.
It makes lucid dreams feel more natural when you've got one. --[[User:Markornikov|Markornikov]] 19:20, 01 Februari 2005 (CET)



== Why is interpretation included? ==

Does the section on dream interpretation really belong in the lucid dreaming book? Can you state exactly how dream interpretation is related to lucid dreaming? Does that relationship merit inclusion in this book?

Points where there is a relationship:

-Focusing on dreams by carrying out interpretation can increase dream recall. (But so can simply writing them down.)

-Dream content can be interpreted in both lucid and non-lucid dreams, however it is unclear how lucidity affects the content.

-&quot;Live&quot; interpretation while the dream is happening adds new dimensions to dream interpretation.

It seems to deserve a mention and a link, but I recommend moving the elaborate description to another book.

: Sorry for the rather slow reply.
: I would not consider dream recall to be connected with lucid dreaming much. I suppose that you ''could'' move the dream interpretation to a seperate book, but that would just add another book which is nowhere near completed. Wikibooks is &quot;loose&quot; at the moment due to the low quantity of good books. Possibly ''when'' it becomes larger things like this will be sorted out.
: If you still wish to: write enough content for it to be worth splitting up the page, take the stuff out into a new wikibook, put it in [[Template:New]], and add a link here to it. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 15:54, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== *Mostly* Dead discussion ==
This whole book's discussion is pretty much dead, but if people have questions about Lucid Dreaming, drop a message at erik212's (me) talk page, or e-mail me at erikmuntean@yahoo.com. -erik212

== What about reading? ==

I've found that I'm more likely to remember my dreams when I read books, so I'm surprised not to find any mention of that here ... am I the only one?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">While the true chords provided by harmonica is very limited, a player can play ''any'' chords as an '''arpeggio'''; that is to play the notes of the chord one after another. That being said, combined with the fact that some of the notes are close together and at the same direction already, allow one to play chords and rhytmn easily.

For example, On a C chromatic, in addition to the native C major chord and D-minor-7th chord: 
*G Major chord: blowing the hole 3, then draw on 4 and 5.
*F major chord: drawing on hole 2 and 3, then blow on 4. F major-7th chord can thus be construct with the addition of blowing hole 5 too.

However, some musicians, especially blues musicians, merely &quot;suggest&quot; the chord. For example, even in second position on a blues harp, there's no dominant-major (V) chords available (in the case of a C harp, the D major chord). So what they did are the following:
*An octave on 1-4 draw to suggest V-chord
*A 4-5 draw  (D-F) to suggest a maj7 chord rooted on the V.
Some will also do that for other chords even if it's available... For example, for G major chord on C diatonic, play only B-D (draw hole 3 and 4)

In terms of playing as a rhythm section, one approximate the chord by playing the notes of the chord in succession: for example, on a chromatic, when playing a G maj7th, one can go like this:

  /   /-----/    /   /-----/
 3+ (4-5) (5-6) 3+ (4-5) (5-6)

Also, even with arpeggio, and have access to all the notes of the chords, a blues/jazz musician may not even play all notes of the rhytmn. For example, a standrad 12-Bar blues have the following:

 I7  / I7  / I7 / I7   /
 IV7 / IV7 / I7 / I7   /
 V7  / IV7 / I7 / I7-V7/

May be played like this:
 2  3  4  3  / 2  3  4  3  /  2  3  4  3  / 2  3  4  3  /
 1+ 2+ 3+ 2+ / 1+ 2+ 3+ 2+ /  2  3  4  3  / 2  3  4  3  /
 1  2' 3&quot; 2' / 1+ 2+ 3+ 2+ /  2  3  4  3  / 2  3  2' 1  /

Note that this use a normal major chord to simulate a seventh chord.

      <comment>/* Tremolo vs Vibrato */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Overbending=
'''Overbending''', commonly referred to as overblows and overdraws, is a difficult technique to master. The physics are simple to explain: In an overbend, the opposite reed as in normal play is brought to vibrate - in an overblow, the draw reed is made to vibrate upon the blow airflow, and in an overdraw, the blow reed is made to vibrate upon the draw airflow. For this reason, overbending cannot be done on a harmonica with windsavers.

Because the opposite reed commonly acts as a buffer for excess air, this is easier said than done. The sound is also harsher, similar to the sound of a hard pressed organ key.

Overblowing is done the same way as a bend in the upper register - by tightening the jaw, bringing the tongue up slightly, and trying to sound the desired harmonic. To improve the overbending capability of a harmonica, one can make the gap between the reeds and the plate smaller.

On a chromatic harmonica, overbends can be done from hole 8 to 12. On a tremolo, they can be done on every hole.

=Ornaments=
==Approach==
Also known as grace notes, this usually involve playing a note a half-step lower/higher real quick and then play the actual piece. if nt indicated, this is usually fine in blues, rocks, and jazz. On a harmonica, you can use one of the following:
===Slide jab===
The technique is for a slide-in note. One will approach a slide-in note with the slide out, then jab it in quickly.
===Reverse jab===
The technique is for a slide-out note. One will approach a slide-out note with the slide in, then release it in quickly.
===Bend grace note===
use bending to bend the note half-step lower briefly, before playing.
===Glissando===
*Start with a chord right next to the actual hole, then quickly go to the actual hole and block out the rest with a tongue slap.

==Tremolo vs Vibrato==
Just like guitar's misnamings, Tremolo and vibrato on a harmonica is also misnamed. So let's set it straight, as per music theory:
*A '''vibrato''' is a fluctuation of pitch, usually accompanied with synchronous fluctuations of loudness and timbre, of such extent and rate as to give a pleasing flexibility, tenderness, and richness to the tone.
*A '''tremolo''' is a rapid fluctuation of intensity (loudness and sound pressure) without changing the pitch.
While all kind of musics use ornaments, remember, '''play it only when it is musically appropriate'''. Sometimes, it's best not to do any ornamentation, especially if it's not how one would play in this style (e.g.: Canon in D played in classical style is very different from playing in blues style)

===Tremolo===
====Hand/Finger Tremolo====
{{chapter stub}}
A hand/finger tremolo is achieved by rapidly opening and closing the cupped hands around the harmonica to adjust volume.

===Vibrato===

====Shake====
Shake is also known as warble.

====Slide Shake (&quot;Trill&quot;)====
What traditionally called as a trill on a chromatic is '''not''' a trill. As it involves moving the slide in and out rapidly, it is more appropriately a type of vibrato.

====Flutter tounge====
{{chapter stub}}
A flutter tongue is different on chromatic harmonica as it actually mostly involves the throat. It is achieved by making a sort of snoring sound in the back of the throat, both inhaling and exhaling.

====Tongue vibrato====
You make vibrations inside your mouth with your tongue (depends, back and forth, up and down, or some mixed motion) as if you
were trying to bend the note using the tongue motion.

In simple words you just move your tongue back and forth very fast as if trying to whistle exhaling and inhaling the air. Don't use your throat or lungs for breathing for a while, just use the amount of air in your cheeks. Move the tongue really fast. In this case the trajectory of the air stream is not straight and pressure on the reed is somewhat mixed causing some kind of turbulence.

This effect is very impressive when used on a bent note with at least half of the tone room above and below. The best use of it in my opinion is by getting the deepest bent note, say, 2 draw 2-step bend and then do what was described above by adding some air pressure. 

In fine, when you vibrate your tongue the note fluctuates from the 2-step deep bend to almost pure 2 draw - with larger increment of time devoted to the 2-step deep bent note and smaller increment of time devoted to the unbent note or I would say to transition from 2-step bend to unbent note and back. That is, you are to hear the bent note almost constantly with transitory vibrato effect along the possible bending range. All this happens during the tongue vibration.

====Throat Vibrato====

Throat vibrato is one of the most important harmonica techniques to master.  It adds color and variety to your notes in the same way that it does for a singer, and it is intimately associated with good tone.  There are several different ways of achieving various vibratos on the harp, including diaphragm vibrato, hand vibrato, and throat vibrato.  Diaphragm vibrato and throat vibrato are closely related, while hand vibrato is achieved by opening and closing the hands to vary the air seal cup at the back of the harp.

Diaphragm vibrato primarily makes use of the diaphragm for altering the amount of air flowing through the harp, which provides a rhythmic pulsing of volume from softer to louder to softer.  Throat vibrato may be the most emotional of the vibratos by making use of pitch changes as well as volume changes.

The key to throat vibrato is a smooth oscillation of both pitch and volume.  Done poorly it sounds chunky, and not smooth. Done well it sounds smooth and natural and wonderful.  Strive for a sine-wave type continuous smoothness, with consistent pitch and volume changes.  Rhythm is an important part of the vibrato. You can do vibrato at different speeds, so you choose a speed that fits with the rhythm and feel of the music.  The pulses of the vibrato should be made to divide the notes into even intervals to add to the rhythmic content of the music.

The classic way to get throat vibrato is to imitate a rapid fire machine gun (eh eh eh eh eh), like when you were a kid. Then do it inhaling instead of exhaling.  It's the same throat motion that gets the throat vibrato. Work on it until all the chunkiness is gone, and it sounds as natural in your play as it does in a singer's voice.

A good way to get the feel is to put vibrato on the 3 draw 1/2 step (or even less) bend. Your throat is involved getting the bend initially, so there's some feel there before you go for the vibrato.  Breathing from the diaphragm will help control the vibrato.  There's always an interaction between the throat and diaphragm when doing a vibrato, since each is involved in controlling the air stream.  For throat vibrato, obviously the emphasis is on the throat--but you'll probably notice some involvement of the diaphragm as well.

Try it amplified, but play softly.  Practice very soft draw bends.  At some point you'll notice what feels like a direct connection between your throat and the note.  Every little nuance of throat motion is reflected in the sound.  Work on playing the 3 draw 1/2 step bend softly.  Then put some vibrato on the note by pulsing the air stream with your throat.  The pitch will change up and down because you've got a hold of the bend with your throat.  Keep at it, it's worth it!

====Combo vibrato====
This is a combo of diaphragm, tonque and jaw technique while bending the note. The diaphragm is working a quick vibrato, while the tonque/jaw are doing a pumping action to enhance and speed up the vibrato even more. Also, bend the note as you do this.

==Split intervals==
Unlike other wind instruments, the harmonica can play numerous notes at once. Aside from intervals made up of adjacent notes, a player can play split intervals by blocking the holes between the ones needed with his tongue, thus playing only the two outmost notes.

While the principle is simple, in practice, this is very difficult. Most people, when they do tongue block, can only do one side (and usually can only block the holes on their left). Thus, when they are trying to move their harmonica left and right to sound the reed, they will either make no sound, or make a wrong sound. Furthermore, most people have difficulties stretching their mouth wide enough.

==Rake==
{{chapter stub}}
==Shimmer==
{{chapter stub}}


=Octave=
If a player stretch the mouth wide enough, and block out a certain number of holes in the middle such that only two notes that are octave apart (e.g.: C1 and C2) will sound, they will form a '''octave'''.
:For chromatic, that means stretching out across five holes, and then block out the 3 holes in the middle with your tounge.
:For diatonic, stretch out across four holes and then block out the 2 holes in the middle. Note you can only form a true octave on the blow, and just a few draw notes.
===Slide bump===
As player play a slide-out note, immediately bump the slide in and let it out quickly, which let it rise up a bit.
===Slide dip===
As player play a slide-in note, immediately let it out and press it back in quickly, which let it lower down for a short while.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you actually know your stuff, you will know that a good quality harmonica is gonna cost way more than a few dollars... especially a chromatic, which is $100 or more. Even though most harmonicas have good manufacturing, proper maintenance and preventative measures are still needed. Aside from the cost of repairs, you might have difficulty finding someone skilled enough to repair your harmonica, especially if you are not good at repairing!

#'''Always store your harmonica in a case'''. A hard case would be the best, but even a leather bag that fit the harmonica snuggy is good to protect your harmonica from dust. A hard harmonica case also protects your harmonica from minor impact. If you need to carry numerous harmonicas, you may want to consider a harmonica briefcase, which usually can store all 12-key diatonic, plus one or two 16-hole chromatic, and maybe your microphone too.
::A very good homemade case can be made by the Pelican waterproof cases. Note that Microcase usually do not come with the lining.
:::microcase 1040/1050 is good for 12-hole chromatic
:::microcase 1060 is good for 16-hole chromatics
#'''Avoid extreme temperatures'''. While your plastic comb should be somewhat tolerant to temperature, your wood comb definitely isn't; since it's already subjected to swelling and shrinking at room temperature, don't even encourage it more by using those.
#'''Avoid dust and other particles'''. Dust will interfer with the movements of the reed, making it sound weird.  Of course, make sure there are no food particle in your mouth, either.
#'''Avoid excess moisture'''. Obvious for wood comb (it swell and shrink), but all chromatic are effected, as they have windsavers. Thus, '''never dunk your harmonica into water/beer/liquid etc.''' Even if it's a plastic-comb harp with no windsavers, the reedplate, reed, bolt and/or screws may rust. 
#'''Clear any moisture if possible'''. Most of the moisture actually come from your mouth. After playing, shake the harmonica a little bit,, pat it against your palm softly, and wipe it clean with a cloth.
#'''Avoid the beach if possible'''. The salty air can cause the reeds to rust rapidly.

==Before playing==
When you acquire a new harmonica the reeds will not have been played much other than factory testing. It usually takes a couple of weeks of playing gently for the reeds to be fully resonant and 'broken in' so to speak, this enables you to get the full life expectancy from the reeds. It is also recommended to warm your harmonica up to body temperature before playing by either playing it gently or storing it near your body.

==Routine cleaning==
*After playing, shake the harmonica a little bit, pat it against your palm softly, and wipe it clean with a cloth. Keyword here is GENTLY.
*Once a while, use alcohol and a minimal dyed smooth cloth (like those for wiping glasses) to clean the mouthpiece and cover.

==Advance cleaning==
===Cleaning the mouthpiece/slide package===
Unless we all decided to use Tombo's S-50, the slide package is a blessing and curse at the same time. When it works, it's a blessing, as we can do quick chromatic runs and slide-based effects. when it doesn't... well, no amount of musicianmenship can save you as your slide move slowly, or even worse, stopped completely!

Thus, we all have to take it apart, from time to time.
====Warnings====
#Slide package ARE made up of a few tiny but crucial pieces. Do it on a flat table with ample lighting.
#Slide package is as fragile, if not more, than the reed plates. Always prepare your work surface in prior.

====Tools needed====
#'''Precision Screwdriver'''. Preferably a precision version.
#'''Microfiber cloth'''
#'''Rubbing Alcohol''' To clean off any old grim
#'''Lubricant''' The lubricant have twofold purpose. Obviously, it is supposed to make your slide slide easier, but also do some sealing, which helps its maintenance. Franz Chmel recommedned paraffin oil, but I personally use vaseline, since it's safer, mainly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Talking about yourself=

In this lesson, we learn how to say where we stay, where we come from and whether we work or study.  The conjugating of the verbs involved is also explained.

==Ngihlala eThekwini==

:'''uNandi''': Sawubona Philani!
:'''uPhilani''': Yebo sawubona Nandi!
:'''uNandi''': Unjani?
:'''uPhilani''': Ngisaphila, wena unjani?
:'''uNandi''': Nami ngikhona.
:'''uPhilani''': Wena uhlalaphi?
:'''uNandi''': Ngihlala eThekwini, uhlala kuphi?
:'''uPhalani''': Mina ngihlala eGoli.

Before explaining the dialogue fully, the verb ''-hlala'' with its pronoun prefixes is given.  ''Mina, Wena, Yena, Nina, Thina, Bona'' are used for emphasis, just as we can say, &quot;Me, I live in Durban&quot; in English.  This means that Zulu is a pro-drop language like Spanish, Greek, and many others.

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! '''Pronoun'''
! '''isenzo'''
! '''isiNgisi'''
|-
| Mina
| ngiyahlala
| I live
|- 
| Wena
| uyahlala
| You live
|-
| Yena
| uyahlala
| He/She lives
|-
| Thina
| siyahlala
| We live
|-
| Nina
| niyahlala
| You(pl) live
|-
| Bona
| bayahlala
| They live
|}

Every verb is used in this manner, so for instance ''-sebenza'' means ''work'' so 'Ngiyasebenza' means ''I work''. It needs to be noted here that ''ya'' is added in between subject concord, the ''ngi'' part, and the verb stem.  This is only done when there is no expressed object or adjunct. It should be noted that writing 'Yena ngiyahlala' in Zulu is the same as writing &quot;He stay&quot; in English. Leaving out the subject concord, for instance, 'Mina hlala', is the same as &quot;Me, stay!&quot; in English, where the second word is a command.  If the pronoun is used it must always agree with the subject concord.  
One way to remember the names of the pronouns is to think of them as Aunts, Thina (Tina), Mina, Nina.  Say &quot;Mina ngi, Thina si, Nina ni&quot; aloud to yourself a few times.  

{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! '''isiZulu'''
! '''isiNgisi'''
|-
| Uhlalaphi?
| Where do you stay?
|-
| Uhlala kuphi?
| Where do you stay?
|-
| eThekwini
| At/in/from Durban
|-
| eGoli
| At/in/from Johannesburg
|}

The above table introduces the ''-phi'' affix which means ''where''.  It cannot stand alone so it is either added to the end of the verb or ''ku-'' is prefixed to it. Words in Zulu beginning with 'e' mean ''at somewhere''. A list of places in South Africa is provided below.


{| border=1 class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! isiNgisi
| Pretoria
| Cape Town
| Johannesburg
| Durban
| Pietermaritzburg
| Ladysmith
|-
! isiZulu
| iPitoli
| iKapa
| iGoli
| iThekwini
| uMgungundlovu
| uMnambithi
|-
|}

In principle, if we want to create the name of a place that we do not know the actual name for, we can take the English word for it and add an 'i' to the beginning of it.  So ''London'' would be ''iLondon''.  To turn this into the place of/at/in London we change the 'i' to an 'e'.

==Ngiphuma eFlansi==
Jean starts talking to an older man. So to show respect he uses Sanibona and plurals.

:'''uJean''': Sanibona baba.
:'''uNjabulo''': Yebo sawubona. 
:'''uJean''': Ninjani? 
:'''uNjabulo''': Ngikhona, wena unjani?
:'''uJean''': Ngisaphila.
:'''uNjabulo''':Igama lami uNjabulo. Ungubani?
:'''uJean''': NginguJean.
:'''uNjabulo''': Ngiyajabula ukukwazi.
:'''uJean''': Nami ngiyajabula ukukwazi.
:'''uNjabulo''': Uphuma kuphi?
:'''uJean''': Ngiphuma eFlansi. Niphumaphi?
:'''uNjabulo''': Ngiphuma eKapa

Here in this example ''eFlansi'' is once again a locative and means ''in France''.  We have also introduced how to ask someone's name. ''Ubani'' means ''who?'' ''Ungu-'' means ''you are''. So ''Ungubani'' means ''you are who'' or ''Who are you?''

Another way to ask someone's name is ''Igama lakho ngubani?''.

In general, this is the best way to express where you come from. Below is a list of countries.

| iZimbabwe || iAngola || iButswana || iNamibhiya || iMekisiko
|-
|}
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; uMzansi is also used it is a loan word from Xhosa.

Also note that depending on where you are it might be acceptable to say ''iFrance'' or ''iSpain''. This is true of large cities.  But it will always be correct to use the terms above.

==Ngiyafunda/Ngiyasebenza ==
The above conversation continues.

:'''uNjabulo''': Wenza msebenzi muni?
:'''uJean''': Ngingumfundisi.
:'''uNjabulo''': Singudokotela.

==Ngingudokotela==

|child
|-
|&lt;u&gt;''yebo''&lt;/u&gt;
|yes
|&lt;u&gt;''cha''&lt;/u&gt;
|no
|}

If we remember one of the ways to say our name, ''NginguPhilani'' means ''I am Philani''.  The same applies for saying you are a doctor or teacher.

:'''uThabo''': Ngingudokotela.
:'''uNosipho''': Hhayi mina ngingunesi!

:'''uZodwa''': Wena ungudokotela na?
:'''uThabo''': Yebo, ngingudokotela. Umyeni wakho ungumpheki?
:'''uZodwa''': Cha, yena ungumfundisi.

This above dialogue illustrates that the pronouns and concords apply here too with ''-ng-''. The ''na'' at the end of Zodwa's first sentence turns it into a question.  So the sentence means: 'Are you a doctor?'. 'Umyeni wakho ungumpheki?' uses tone to indicate the question.  ''-kho'' means ''your'' and ''wa-'' is for agreement.  So the sentence means: 'Is your husband a cook?'.

'''''Note'''''
The words that are underlined need to be learned for the lesson and the exercises.

==Summary==

* We say where we live - Ngihlala eHillbrow.
* We can ask someone where they live - Wena uhlalaphi? or Uhlala kuphi?
* We know words for various cities in South Africa - iGoli iKapa etc or eGoli.
* We can form synthetic names for cities that we do not know the real name for - iLondon or iParis. 
* We can ask someone what they do - Wenza msebenzi muni?
* We can say what we do - Ngingudokotela.
* We have learn various nouns for certain professions - unesi, umpheki etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm going to simplify the template, as well as switch everything to Latin script. The text below has been copied directly from the Public Domain Peace Corps Uzbek Language Compentencies book, it should be edited as the book evolves.

Uzbek is a member of the Turkic language family. Speakers of these languages number approximately 150 million and range from the Tuvas of Siberia and Uyghurs of China through the Kazaks and Kirgiz of Central Asia to the Tatars of Europe and Turks and Azeris of the Near East. While all the Turkic languages share a common structure and basic vocabulary, many (for example, Chuvash and Yakut) are not mutually intelligible. However Uzbeks and Uyghurs are able to converse freely with one another because their ancestors adopted the same local Turkic dialects spoken in urban areas of Central Asia.

Standard Uzbek conforms to those urban dialects without being exactly the same as any one of them. It incorporates several elements borrowed from local Persian dialects. This influence is most apparent in the vowel system and in the large number of words borrowed from Persian and Arabic. Standard Uzbek also reflects a heritage from the classical language in Arabic script called Chagatay or Central Asian Turi, which was used by Muslim Turks until the early 20th century. The period of Soviet rule also left its stamp on the standard literary language. This manual of the standard Uzbek language is intended to facilitate the acquisition of the basic language skills that Peace Corps volunteers will need to enrich their tour in the Republic of Uzbekistan. Conceivably, its materials may be used in conjunction wit a textbook for teaching Uzbek at the University level.

The authors are aware that this first competency based manual of Uzbek contains imperfections, but they remind their readers:

&lt;center&gt;''&quot;Oyda ham dogʻ bor&quot;''&lt;br&gt;
Even the moon has flaws&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[http://www.cirquedusoleil.com &quot;Cirque du Soleil&quot;] is made famous for their breathtaking shows and extraordinary creativity. Cirque du Soleil’s latest production, [http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/showstickets/love/intro/intro.htm &quot;LOVE&quot;], celebrates the musical legacy of The Beatles. Drawn from the poetry of the lyrics, LOVE explores the content of the songs in a series of scenes inhabited by real and imaginary people. LOVE has an international cast of 60 and creates a high energy atmosphere underscored by aerial performance, extreme sports and urban, freestyle dance. With panoramic sound and visuals, the audience can experience The Beatles as never before at The Mirage, Las Vegas. 

Cirque du Soleil recently added onto LOVE with their [http://www.thebeatlesrevolutionlounge.com &quot;REVOLUTION&quot;] Lounge (amazing website by-the-way - allows you to paint your own background to the page - very neat). The lounge offers an extended experience of LOVE, before and after the show. This is the first time Cirque du Soleil has drawn upon its innovative talent to create a unique nightlife experience in Las Vegas.

Revolutionary in its design and atmosphere, the REVOLUTION lounge features cutting-edge, interactive experiences to create a psychedelic sensory environment and a contemporary interpretation of The Beatles’ era. Each night, is an evolutionary journey, where both the music and interior transform, resulting in an eclectic nightlife adventure at The Mirage.

Another visionary, interactive, live show is Blue Man Group. Their production in Chicago (this author has not seen the Vegas version) involved the audiences in an interactive experience even before the show began. Blue Men planted themselves in the crowd and moved on stage only after the show had begun.

Without a word being spoken, this group can evoke audience involvement and a sense that the stage doesn't stop at the front of the theater. The crowd handles stage props such as huge rolls of paper unfurled from the front of the auditorium and giant dangling plastic objects suspended from the ceiling. &quot;Volunteers&quot; who never had a choice about the matter, participate on stage and become actors without a script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
The '''lung''' is an organ we use when we breathe. It takes oxygen from the air and transports it to the blood. It also takes carbon dioxide from the blood and releases it into the air. 

==What do lungs look like?==
[[Image:heart-and-lungs.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The '''lungs''' flank the heart and great vessels in the chest [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#cavity|cavity]]. &lt;small&gt;(Source: ''[[Gray's Anatomy|Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body]]'', 20th ed. 1918.)&lt;/small&gt;]]
Your lungs are located in the chest on either side of the heart. There are two of them. They are similar in appearance, but not identical. 

Lungs have a spongy texture and a honeycomb pattern. They have much more surface area in total than just the outer surface the lung. Each lung is separated into [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#lobe|lobes]]. There are three lobes on the right and two on the left.  The left lung contains a dent called the &quot;[[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#cardiac|cardiac]] notch&quot;. The cardiac notch allows room for the heart. The lungs form the major part of thorasic cavity.

==What are the parts of the lungs?==
The two main bronchi are the tubes that enter the roots of the lungs. The bronchi continue to divide within the lung with each branch smaller than the last. At the end of the smallest bronchi (called terminal bronchioles) there are tiny sacks. These sacks are made up of clusters of alveoli, which look a little like grapes in a bunch.  The individual alveoli are wrapped in blood vessels. This is where the gas exchange actually occurs. Blood without much oxygen from the heart is pumped through the [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#pulmonary|pulmonary]] artery to the lungs. Oxygen from the air diffuses into blood and carbon dioxide from the blood is released. The oxygen-rich blood returns to the vein via the pulmonary veins to be pumped back into the rest of the body. The process goes on until you die.

==What is the function of the lungs?==
The cells in our body need oxygen to produce energy. These same cells produce carbon dioxide as a by-product. So there has to be a way for the body to deliver oxygen ''to'' cells and carry carbon dioxide ''from'' cells. The lungs allow your body to trade its waste carbon dioxide for oxygen. 

The lungs also serve as a cushion or shock absorber for the heart. 

==How do the lungs work?==
The diaphragm is a big muscle under your lungs. It pushes downward when you [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#inhale|inhale]], which enlarges the cavity in the chest and causes the lungs to expand. This causes air to flow into them. When the diaphragm relaxes, air flows out and you [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#exhale|exhale]]. One name for this process is ''ventilation''.  

==What organ systems are the lungs connected with?==

The lungs directly connect the respiratory system to the circulatory system, for in the lungs, oxygen will leave the air and enter the blood so that it can be transferred to all of the other cells in your body. Conversely, carbon dioxide is removed from blood back into the air, so that it does not poison the cells that produced it.

==How do the lungs interact with other parts of the body?==
[[Image:Illu_bronchi_lungs.jpg|thumb|[[Bronchi]], bronchial tree, and [[lungs]]. (Cardiac notch labeled at bottom left.)|350px]]Breathing is largely driven by the muscular diaphragm at the bottom of the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm pulls the bottom of the cavity in which the lung is enclosed downward. Air enter through the oral and nasal cavities; it flows through the larynx and into the trachea, which branches out into bronchi. Relaxation of the diaphragm has the opposite effect, passively recoiling during normal breathing.  During exercise, the diaphragm contracts, forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully. The rib cage itself is also able to expand and contract to some degree, through the action of other respiratory and accessory respiratory muscles. As a result, air is sucked into or [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#expel|expelled]] out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a '''bellows lung''' as it resembles a blacksmith's bellows.
Lungs have a tremendous reserve volume as compared to the oxygen exchange requirements when at rest.

==How can you keep your lungs healthy?==
Vital capacity is the maximum volume of air that a person can exhale after maximum inhalation.  A person's vital capacity can be measured by a spirometer (spirometry). In combination with other physiological measurements, the vital capacity can help make a diagnosis of underlying lung disease. 

The environment of the lung is very moist, which makes it hospitable for bacteria. Many respiratory illnesses are the result of bacterial or viral infection of the lungs.  

To keep your lungs healthy, you should not smoke cigarettes and avoid smoky environments. You should not work or live in environments where the air is contaminated with dust or chemicals. If you do have to go into those kinds of environments, wear a respirator. [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#aerobic|Aerobic]] exercise like swimming and running can increase your lungs' vital capacity.
If the alveoli can't get enough air, a person may have [[Wikijunior:Human_Body/Glossary#asthma|asthma]].

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there.

=== [[Wikijunior Kings and Queens of England]] ===
*Target age: up to 10-12 years
*Each monarch from 871 onwards will come with an introduction, a summary of the main features of their reign, a section on what children they had (if they had any) and a section on their death and legacy (except, of course, Queen Elizabeth II). There will also be a short section on the current royal succession. I have already drafted up one page, [[Wikijunior Kings and Queens of England/The Normans|The Normans]], by way of illustration.
*Interested Participants:
**[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 16:57, 13 February 2006 (UTC)
**
*Scope of project: This project would give a broad review of each king and queen regnant of England, highlighting notable events that took place in each reign, and encouraging further study.
*I intend to develop this book regardless of whether there are many others willing to assist at the start (although I would, of course, appreciate any help that's offered). I hope that it will be accepted into the Wikijunior canon, either through the Book of the Quarter mechanism, or alternatively as a Wikijunior book developed outside of that rubric, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 14:47, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
*:The current situation for restricted development is largely my invention.  The real truth is that this is a general agreement among Wikijunior participants and not something that real enforcement can be done regarding these actions.  Some &quot;enforcement&quot; was done by some of the early founders of Wikijunior, and indeed the creation of the [[Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations]] book was started because of some early efforts to create some content and add the book to the Wikijunior cannon that went beyond the original three Wikijunior books.  We are conducting an experiment here to see if it might be possible to create a content development community that emphasises on quality rather than quantity.  The only other similar project that can be compared to this is [[w:Nupedia]], but I think the bureaucratic process there was simply way too strict at all.  Larry Sanger sent the message that if you didn't have a PhD, don't bother trying to contribute to Nupedia.  I don't want to send '''*that*''' message, but the slow growth approach does appear to be reaping some benefits, and has made Wikijunior into a reasonable source of some fairly moderate to high quality children's non-fiction literature.  The rest of Wikibooks follows the quantity of materials over quality, and some blistering critiques of Wikibooks have resulted from people outside of the Wikibooks development community as a result.  If you pick a random Wikibook from [[Main Page]], you will be largely disappointed by what you find... even if you select books that are labeled 75% complete or 100% complete.  There are some real gems of Wikibooks out there, but you really have to dig to find them or be very familiar with Wikibooks.  So far, all five of the &quot;cannonical&quot; Wikibooks are worthy of at least somebody very new to Wikijunior content to look at and learn some meaningful new ideas.  You are, however, perfectly capable of trying to develop this content outside of the Wikijunior community or doing simply what you are doing right now.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:25, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
*::I don't want to go against the grain, I just want to produce more good quality output. Books are really of very limited value if they are not at least 95% complete, and they probably need to be 100% complete for proper value to be obtained out of them. Of the wikijunior books currently in the canon, some appear to be complete already, and of the others, whilst the ancient civilisations one may interest me, the others don't. That's ok, we're all interested in different things, and that's why I am setting out on my own on this book - though other contributors would, of course, be most welcome. I may nip into the ancient civilisations text and see what I can do there - but I'm aware that the civilisations that haven't already been written about, I know little of myself. Hopefully by developing this book, and seeing it through to completion, I can offer a useful addition to the Wikijunior canon, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 17:43, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
*:::Depending on how much participation we have with Wikijunior and general community opinion, I would like to see this become a New Title Suggestion of the Month, rather than just the Quarter.  Plenty of new ideas have come up, and I think we won't be hurting for ideas for new content in Wikibooks.  The cool thing about this is that once a new Wikijunior book has been accepted, there is a large community of people who are interested in seeing it developed, simply by virtue of the voting process alone (unless these are sock puppets).  Previous to this whole process, the general attitude, at least with the people who started Wikijunior, was that we should stick to just the three original texts until they achieve formal publication.  Of course even more ambitious was to have a subscription to Wikijunior where you would receive in the mail one Wikijunior book each month, completely proofed, edited, reviewed, and put onto dead trees.  I think that may be possible in the future, but we certainly need simply more content, and a three month backlog is IMHO not enough, especially for a group of basically volunteers.  A &quot;stable content&quot; website is also planned for Wikijunior (see http://www.wikijunior.org/ for the eventual home) but I believe that nothing is currently &quot;ready for prime time&quot; on that site yet.  Just some more food for thought.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:55, 23 February 2006 (UTC)

*Scope of project: (What is this project going to concentrate on and how to keep it within Wikimedia guidelines.)

This is intended to be a basic survey course for kids to learn about different languages around the world.  As a general survey, this project is more oriented to covering a large variety of languages rather than studying any particular language in depth.  Still, it would be nice to use each individual language page of this project as a starting point to some more in depth study of the language.  This would be done in a manner that the [[Wikijunior Solar System]] currently has a simplified version for the Beck Foundation, but goes into more detail about the major moons and other topics not covered in the basic book.

Something to consider with this Wikibook proposal is that we might want to make some of these pages language-neutral in some way, possibly making it easy to port the content from one language to another.  As a practical matter, this may be very difficult or impossible to achieve, but I'm trying to be creative here.

Note that we are not trying to replace the language training Wikibooks that are already developing on the main Wikibooks site, but this is to provide some basic language skills for younger children and introduce the idea of other languages, especially in areas where children are not exposed to some of these other languages.

In addition to the written words, spoken tools would be developed with this project.  Native speakers of the languages covered would be encouraged to record their voices to be used to help with pronounciation guides, and perhaps some practice exercises that could be used, or some common children's poem or song in that language could be sampled and available for kids to hear and perhaps learn.

=== How Things Work ===
*Target age: Standard Wikijunior (8-12)
*Scope of Project:  This Wikibook is to cover how different everyday items work, and to try and remove the &quot;mystery&quot; and &quot;magic&quot; that ordinary things we take for granted.  Explaining how the inner workings of the device will be explained, with &quot;cut-away&quot; views of the objects and drawings that explain the principles on how key parts of each device work.
*Possible Sections:
**Toaster
**Vacuum Cleaner
**Elevator
**Rocket
**Light Bulb
**Neon/fluorescent light
**Refrigerator/Air Conditioners
**Computer
***hard-drive
***CPU
***modem
***RAM
***network
**Automobile engine
**Mechanical Clock
**Quartz Timer
**Television
**Liquid Crystal Display
*Typical questions for each article:
**Who invented it?
**How does it get power? (What makes it run?)
**How does it work?
**How dangerous is it?
**What does it do?
**How does it vary? (e.g., range of sizes, running parameters, variants like gas/diesel...)
**How has it changed the world?
**What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created?

*Comments: I would change the question &quot;How does it get its power?&quot; If I'm interpreting it correctly, then the answer for most of these items would be &quot;electricity.&quot; I would suggest &quot;How does it work?&quot; instead. Of course, you might to remove computer then; that, I think, is a bit too complicated to explain.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 02:02, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
:The &quot;How does it get power?&quot; question may not apply for all items, but some items are gasoline powered, or for something really cool like a rocket or steam locomotive might have the power systems as something more unique or critical.  I'm trying to think of about 3-5 more &quot;standard questions&quot; that could be asked for a Wikijunior book like this, to keep with the general format that forms most of the other Wikijunior books.&lt;p&gt;As far as the Computer section is concerned, this is something that has annoyed me from when I was a little kid myself.  Everybody told me that computers were so complicated that they couldn't understand how they worked, and that I wouldn't be able to figure it out myself.  I took it upon myself to try and find out exactly how computers worked, and found myself in a rather interesting career as a result.  I don't think that tackling computers as a subject, at least in outline as to what makes a computer work and &quot;do its stuff&quot; is necessarily beyond the 8-12 year old age range, although I admit it will be much harder to simplify than explaining how a light bulb works.  Subsections like explaining a hard-drive, CPU, modem, network card, etc. may be of practical use to more fully explain a computer, just as explaining the transmission, cataletic converter, radiator and other parts of an automobile might also be interesting &quot;more detailed&quot; sections for the automobile.  Some machines are very complicated by their nature, but that doesn't mean kids can't try to understand the basics on how they work. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:22, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

True, I'm a teenager, so it wasn't to long ago that I was a kid. I remember being annoyed by people telling me things were to complicated to understand! Also, I think a good question for some of the items would be &quot;What else is it used for?&quot; For something like a toaster or vacuum cleaner its obviously not needed, but for something like a computer or a car, there's a whole lot of things they're used for.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 04:34, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

I'd want to add either Refrigerator or Air Conditioner to the list (actually, it's worth while to mention one and the other). Just anything that would cover the principle of condensing a gas or a phase change heat pump. (And even my college-educated friends would hold the belief that putting a refrigerator into a closed room and leaving the refrigerator door open would cool the room.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:46, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

The topic is probably too big for one book. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:43, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
:Yes, that may be true that it is too big for one book, but should that be a reason to not even start it at all?  I think in this particular case, we need to place emphasis on existing articles and bring them up to &quot;publishable standards&quot; than create dozens of articles that never get anywhere.  At the same time, I think this would be a good book, and obviously there is plenty of material that can be obtained to get this Wikibook started.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:45, 4 October 2005 (UTC)
::I agree.  If anyone has ideas of how to pare down the list to a few focus items, we can put these on the original TOC and leave the rest of the list for, i.e., a more/less advanced title targeted at a younger age group, or even (?) a sequel aimed at the same age group.  But they can be tabled until one full book comes together.
:::I've actually been thinking that the list above is ''too short''. I can recall that book The Way Things Work which had lots of useful drawings and was far more exhaustive than the above list. &quot;The topic&quot; is not too long, because by definition the topic is what we have suggested for the TOC. Many things could also fit in with the theme, sure, but I wholeheartedly believe that a book that discusses everyday things would be a great way to teach the physical sciences. Perhaps once microphones, speakers and the telephone are added to the list we could call it complete. Thus, while the title is &quot;How Things Work&quot; the topic is not &quot;How Things Work&quot;: the topic is &quot;How this list of provided things work.&quot; It would be a cute wiki project to do &quot;How Everything Works,&quot; but that's certainly the scope of a wiki site and nobody here ever suggested that. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:52, 6 October 2005 (UTC)
: I'd be in favour of going ahead with &quot;How Computers Work&quot;, as the first book in a series of Wikijunior Wikibooks, all themed to &quot;How Stuff Works&quot;.  --  [[user:zanimum]]

I've added a suggested question to the list. What idea(s) and/or inventions had to be developed before it could be created? Kids should see the connections between ideas past and present. I don't think you have to worry about making the list too long as long as you choose inventions that are relevant in kids lives. Keep the details to the basics and get kids to see the bigger questions like &quot;How has this invention changed the world&quot; and What ideas had to come first before this invention could be developed.  The students I work with are fascinated by the topic of inventions and how common items in their daily lives function. --[[User:HMR|hruffner]]

: Yes, we definitely should have the history attached to each thing discussed.  --  [[user:zanimum]]
::Maybe instead of a paragraph about the inventions that lead to each modern product, a timeline could be used in each &quot;article&quot; to outline previous inventions that are relevant. This could help to keep articles more manageable so that this could be made into one comprehensive book. While history is important to understanding of how things come to be, I'm not convinced that it is highly important to the discussion of &quot;how things work.&quot; However, some sort of historical perspective is useful.[[User:Bvcxz|Bvcxz]] 05:25, 19 December 2005 (UTC)

How about having a series of Wikibooks? I know for a fact that there are enough things in a computer that it may take a whole book to describe it to a kid (OS, games, hardware, memory, history just to describe a few topics). Or maybe we could group them into more specific topics as a happy medium? Examples off books: How electronics work (including computers, communications, TVs). How transportation works (cars, trains, planes, boats, bikes, elevators), really that one would be on simple machines if anything. How cities work (Power plants, small section on transportation systems like metro, how everyone knows where to go, who decides what goes where). How cooking works (chemical reactions, why stuff taste good). --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 11:57, 3 December 2005 (UTC)
:Very good idea. I was also thinking that this could be expanded into multiple topic-based books.  If it were to be expanded, it would offer more of an opportunity to go more indepth into the science behind &quot;how things work.&quot; Making physics and chemistry kid friendly often takes many &quot;pictures&quot; and step by step explanations, which can become lengthy. Another option that would allow us to put this all in one concise book is suggested below. [[User:Bvcxz|Bvcxz]] 05:26, 19 December 2005 (UTC) 
:::What about trying to narrow the subject matter for the first set of articles to some specific sub-part of this whole thing.  I would personally like to advocate home consumer appliances to start with, but we could go in other directions as well.  This is also something that can be decided on the project discussion page once we get a &quot;green light&quot; to start the project from the Wikijunior community.  The &quot;How Does it Work - Computer&quot; book should be IMHO a separate proposal and voted on separately by the Wikijunior community.  The idea here is to keep it small, and perhaps a small incremental change once we get rolling on a group of modules. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:16, 20 December 2005 (UTC)
::::Home consumer appliances is a good idea, since these are items that kids are in contact with on a daily basis.  This could also include things that are non-electronic, such as clocks or a gas stove.  It would provide an opportunity to discuss basic mechanics as well as things like basic wave theory (microwave oven) and convection in a more tangible way.[[User:Bvcxz|Bvcxz]] 03:42, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

Suggestion: Many of the suggested questions above could be answered in one, short introductory paragraph at the beginning of each article. I suggest the following breakdowns:
*Introductory paragraph (This paragraph would include any items not directly relevant to how the machine works. These are not ordered.): Who invented it?, What does it do?/What is its purpose/function, How does it vary? Who uses it? How has it changed the world? How dangerous is it?
*Article body (This would be called something like &quot;how does it work?&quot; and would comprise the bulk of the text.): How does it work?, How does it get power?, What makes it run?, Other questions directly related to how the machine operates and its internal makeup
[[User:Bvcxz|Bvcxz]] 05:25, 19 December 2005 (UTC)


Suggested Addition: I would like to add '''Sewing Machine''' to the list of appliances. The functioning is interesting, the use/hobby is back on the rise, and the home sewing machine had a profound impact on history. [[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 22:00, 3 April 2006 (UTC)

I love the idea, I came here because I was looking for an &quot;Introduction to Computers&quot; book written with an 8 year old in mind. I find the entire concept of WikiJunior to be worthy of my time. I am in favor of a general series of books. like [[User:Dragontamer]] suggested, entitled something like &quot;How Everything Works - Computers&quot; and &quot;How Everything Works - Transportation&quot;  this is the only way I see the project meeting the 48 page limit. A comprehensive singular &quot;How Everything Works&quot; would obviously be too large.--[[User:Hapa|Hapa]] 01:18, 5 April 2006 (UTC)--[[User:Hapa|Hapa]] 01:18, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

I really like the idea. But I would like to suggest that you add airplane to the list of things. I think it's a thing that fascinates many kids and it's at least quite easy to explain how it works. 
About computers, you can actually make it quite simple you don't have to explain what a CPU is or what a graphics card is. You can simply explain the basics, that the computer can calculate things, that it needs a program that tells it exactly how to do something i.e. For example &quot;The computer doesn't &quot;think&quot; on it's own, what it can do is follow instructions, these  instructions are called a program. They work as an manual and tells the computer what to do. For example a program might tell the computer to show you a box on the screen where you can enter to numbers and press a button, and then the program will tell the computer to add these numbers withe each other and show the answer in the box.&quot;  --[[User:Mr Shore|Mr Shore]] 02:20, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

*Comments:

Include everything required for humans. Include everything required for green plants. Include common contaminants. (radon, lead, mercury) Include florine. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:47, 3 October 2005 (UTC)

From the title, I was expecting a list of chapters on Earth, Water, Wind and Fire. Maybe &quot;Chemical elements&quot;? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 10:40, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

:Maybe a short introduction could explain that the ancient Greeks believed there were only four &quot;elements&quot;.--[[User:Mcgill|Mcgill]] 03:34, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

*Scope of project: Ah, bugs. They fascinated me a few years ago, and I'm glad I learned about them. This book would teach the kids more about common bugs such as ants, inform them about the more obscure bugs (Aphids, pondskaters, etc.), and show them to tell the difference between insects and arachnids.   
*Comments:&lt;br/&gt;   
I love this book. A very cool concept, and something that would certainly grab the attention of kids. It is also something that can have some education standards applied to it. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:02, 15 April 2006 (UTC)   
    
This is a good idea. Also, centipedes and millipedes are myriapods, not arachnids. --[[User:Gray Porpoise|Gray Porpoise]] 20:03, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

Much care must be tread in planning this, as bugs is an extraordinarily general term. Such a book could conceivably be its own encyclopedia because of how broad it is, but we will have to water it down to the extreme. How we go about this will be important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A reflector oven is as simple as a cardboard box lined on the inside with aluminum foil.  Run wire through the box to create an oven rack.  Make sure the rack is horizontal when the box is placed on its side.  Put the box next to a bed of hot coals with the opening facing the heat, but not so near as to ignite the box.  Put whatever you wish to bake on the rack.  Heat from the coals will bake whatever you put inside the box.  There are countless variations on this theme, including the practice of completely removing one side of the box and tilting it at a 45° angle.  You can prop the box up with rocks or logs, or build legs into it.

You can also construct an oven out of sheet metal, aluminum flashing, or large tin cans as shown below. This tin can oven was constructed by a Pathfinder leader, and tested by Pathfinders in the field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Making fire from an electric spark can be dangerous and should only be used in an emergency.  You will need to set up some tinder ahead of time and then prepare to throw an electrical spark.  This can be done with jumper cables from an automobile by connecting one end of the terminals to the battery, and then quickly touch the other ends together next to the tinder.  '''Do not hold the terminals together for more than an instant''' or you will drain the battery.

*Comments: 

I find this premise to be quite interesting. Origins are a big question in everyone's mind. However, by the nature of this topic, I don't think that it fits the current &quot;collection of articles&quot; type book in which all of the pages can be tied together by the same questions. I believe this book should take a different approach, thereby being more informative in the end. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 05:23, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

I've jumped in at the deep end (being a newbie) and I've sketched out a possible structure with a few example pages - I'm an 'operational thinker'. Please see [[Wikijunior_Life]], its discussion page and [[Wikijunior_Life/Structure_plan]]. I'm not trying to impose a structure by fiat, but these pages might be useful discussion items. --[[User:Barry Desborough|Barry Desborough]] 06:17, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

*Scope of project: Children can be really fascinated by transport (I remember myself when I was younger. Even now I'm still fascinated by transport:)). Probably because it combines the &quot;magic&quot; of technology and the magic of travel. This book would describe various modes of transport, answering typical questions (Like ''What is bigger: ocean liner or airship?'')

*Scope of project: This project will concentrate on creating learning materials for students of different levels. These could include (not limited to) tutorials, exercise material, tests, etc.   
*Comments:   
  
I'm wondering if this proposal is suffering from being overly broad? Perhaps it should be reorganized into something more manageable like ''Wikijunior Beginning Math'' or ''Wikijunior Basic Grammar''. One area we could get a huge infusion of participants with something like this is with the home schooling crowd that needs materials like this, especially ones that are low-cost. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:06, 10 February 2006 (UTC)   
:Yes, I think these need to be broken up. Each topic (Math, Grammar, History) is easily enough for its own series divided by level. Homeschoolers would especially benefit from English grammar, math, and foreign language (not listed above, but in the same scope I think). Those are the areas where texts are most often purchased. [[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 04:02, 31 March 2006 (UTC)   
   
Have re-organised the sub-lists a bit. This is a great area for online presentation and increased interactivity with the user. It could be organised along the lines of a standard syllabus or concept maps. The organisation/navigation could be presented in different ways, pointing to the same material. Development could do with a 'standard' organisational map, for the ease of reference by developers.--[[User:Barry Desborough|Barry Desborough]] 16:36, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

I think this is great but, I do feel it needs to be broken up not by grade so much as age.  As a homeschooling mother I tend to think in the ages mind set, grades are an artificial measure that isn't standard.  I am working on a book with a horrible title called &lt;U&gt;Math For Young People&lt;/U&gt; based on ages.  I started with basic counting, suggestions on games to teach for the teacher, and workbook pages.  I hope to have a mini book with color photo's for each chapter too.  I plan on covering only the basics, like counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Geometry, measuring, fractions, decimals, etc... if I do attempt will be for a higher level or additional book.  It was actually this book that inspired me to make the book...may be I can add it to the current project when I'm done. Aukxsona.

:This is a stub that was started prior to the creation of New Title Suggestions, and in fact is one of the reasons I started the whole process of suggesting new titles, which is why the stub even exists. This should be viewed as a continuation of the Wikijunior South America book to concentrate on other areas of the world. IMHO, we should be concentrating on whole continents instead of smaller geographic areas to start with, but this might be an interesting book in the future. I'm adding this simply to list it and to acknowledge that somebody wanted to get this going in the past. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:52, 5 November 2005 (UTC)   
::Comparing to the other Culture Wikijunior books, I think an excellent proposal would be [[Wikijunior United States]] (or [[Wikijunior States of the United States]] or a similar title). [[Wikijunior South America]], for example, sets out parameters that it wishes to address for each country, then has an entry for each country to address those questions. I think using a similar model for the 50 United States (maybe with extra entries for D.C. and other territories) would be a brilliant idea, and very useful for children in the age group. I think dedicating an entire book to a single state is a bit much detail for 8-11 year olds -- at least, there'd probably be more use for one book with less detail than 50 books with more detail, and it'd be easier to produce. I would be willing to work on this, and I think we could recruit from the existing [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject U.S. states/List of state WikiProjects|U.S. state WikiProjects]] and notice boards ([[w:Wikipedia:U.S. Wikipedians' notice board|U.S.]], [[w:Wikipedia:U.S. Southern wikipedians' notice board|South]], [[w:Wikipedia:U.S. Northern Wikipedians' notice board|North]]). -- [[User:Tetraminoe|Tetraminoe]] 12:33, 28 December 2005 (UTC)   
:::To add a comment, since I've nominated [[Wikijunior States of the United States]] on [[Wikijunior:New Book of the Quarter/2006-2nd Quarter Vote]]: I still think this is an excellent idea, but admittedly the final product would be mostly useful within the U.S., where it is pretty common material for an elementary school curriculum or children's books. I don't imagine schoolchildren in other countries study the U.S. in such detail. Therefore, my nomination comes with the disclaimer I know the product would be of limited geographic scope, but I feel would be very useful and appropriate within said scope.   
:::If indeed there is concern about Wikijunior stagnating, and the result is an attempt to open the project further, it seems appropriate to me that perhaps the new book for Q2, in fact, choose 2 books. Those two books could be for different subject matter, likely to attract contributors with different interests -- for instance, one in ''Science'' and the other in ''Culture''. Perhaps one could even have a limited geographic scope (given again that it would be so useful within that scope, and that there exists a large body of Wikipedia contributors with expertise in the area who could be recruited to Wikibooks, particularly during the summer months when the Q2 new books will begin). Just a thought. --[[User:Tetraminoe|Tetraminoe]] 08:35, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

:I love the idea of this as a Wikibook, or even with Wikijunior. It needs more work to fully develop as an idea, but a very NPOV treatment of religious ideas does have its place with kids. Especially to simply understand what motivates different groups of people to do the things they do, which religion often does. After 9/11, anti-Christian and anti-Moslim sentiment has been fueled, often by simple misunderstanding of the religious and ideas. Moslims worrying that Mecca is going to get Nuked by America and America paranoid beyond belief that all of Islam is out to destroy America are both patently wrong. Everybody needs to learn more about other religions. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:35, 26 November 2005 (UTC)   
::The idea is nice, but this would never be NPOV. It's just too touchy a subject. What religions get to be included? Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc may sound fine, but what even qualifies as a religion? Do we include LDS? Does Wicca get qualified as a religion and not a cult? What about Scientology? Where do we draw the line? I just see it getting too complicated, especially for Wikijunior. Maybe as a [[World Religions]] textbook. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:41, 28 November 2005 (UTC)   
:::I don't see why this should be excluded on that basis of NPOV issues alone. Wikipedia does a very good job with trying to define religion and discuss the concept, and I can point to many Wikipedia articles that have a NPOV tone and work very well about all of these proposed articles. That the NPOV problems are going to happen with proposal is true, as religion plays an often central role in most people's lives. For that reason it is very important for kids to be exposed to these ideas in a NPOV format, rather than with the politically and racially charged descriptions that are usually offered to children. This is to discuss what religious philosophies are about, not to classify religions either. As far as Wicca and Scientology, I say why not? Both, if done from a NPOV, can and should be included. The word cult is usually abused to mean basically &quot;any religious thought that I disapprove of and think you should not be associated with&quot;. The more literal definition is a religious movement started by an individual professing a specific lifestyle. That includes Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism which can all be called cults by a broad defintion. In that regard Wicca is not a cult but a religion, if you want to get into semantics. The advantage of doing this through Wikijunior is that I can't think of any other place where you can gather together a broad range of cultures and philosophies to be able to pull something like this off. The difference between this and a [[World Religions]] wikibooks is that this is for children, and the nature of Wikijunior is more toward encyclopedic entries so this would be more a simplification of existing articles on Wikipedia. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:09, 29 November 2005 (UTC)   
::::I don't disagree that kids need to learn about religions NPOVally, but If we want that to happen, I just fear it won't be here. So anything that someone has deemed a &quot;religion&quot; can be included? The Branch Dividians? Heaven's Gate? Order of the Solar Temple? Raelism? Symbionese Liberation Army? Where does the line get drawn? Do we have a children's book 1000 pages long? I just fear this is not managable. From a size POV ''and'' a NPOV POV. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:25, 29 November 2005 (UTC)   
:::::The neat thing about how this whole thing is set up (copying from many good ideas of the past from Wikimedia projects) is that it is up to ordinary users like yourself to help decide what the next Wikijunior book should be. Vote or don't vote for this book to become the next Wikijunior book. As it looks like for 2006, I highly doubt this Wikibooks will get a green light as there are many others that seem like a higher priority and have much more interest. I also set this system up specifically to help generate interest so when the book gets an official green light to start adding sections, there is already in place a fairly large group that has some ideas for sections and is ready to add content. If the widespread support of the Wikijunior Ancient Civilizations books is any indication, I think the Wikijunior Dinosaurs Wikibook is going to be a runaway success. I think eventually this religon Wikibook should be written, but there are many much higher priorities before it should get that green light. If and when Wikijunior gets some widespread support from the Wikipedia crowd in large numbers (or similar sized participation) I have no doubt that something on Religion could occur. As it is so far, this book suggestion won't even be nominated until 2nd Quarter of 2006. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 06:43, 30 November 2005 (UTC)   
:: One way to deal with the what-to-include problem would be have a lower adherent limit (the religion has to have at least ''x'' million living adherents to be included). At least that would leave out the suicide cults. :-) Unfortunately, it would also leave out ancient polytheisms. So perhaps that rule can be: either have ''x'' million living adherents or be a historically important but long dead religion. I doubt the Wiccas would count themselves as a dead religion. And there are no living members of the Cult of the Ionian Tadpole Worshippers to complain about their not being regarded as historically important. (I just now made up that religion up, so don't go googling it.) I've written this somewhat irreverently, but I am not really trying to diss the Wiccas, etc. This is a children's book, and we need to limit its size. Using numbers of adherents to limit the book size seems to me entirely reasonable and dispenses with value judgmnets. Unfortunately, the size of a religion will itself be controversial. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:13, 3 February 2006 (UTC)   
    
I like this idea, I think it is a good thing for children to be tolerant of other religions, especially in such a diverse religious age.

*Scope of project:&lt;br&gt;   
Rocks and minerals are a standard item for most elementary school science curricula, and something that is interesting to children with some significant visual resources as well. Many visual resources are available under copyleft arrangements, or it would be possible for contributors to create the resources directly without too much trouble. It is also important to not only give encyclopedic knowledge about this subject, but to try and explain why we know what we know about these substances. It would also be useful to try and orient this book to specific standards to make it useful for classroom education as well. This may take a rethinking of the general approach we have been taking with Wikijunior.

Comment:This is definitely a popular topic with kids and schools. Using standards being followed by schools and other educational groups is a concept I want to support. Topics like this are great because they have real-world usage appeal as opposed to being a favorite subject of a Wikibookian that may not be useful to educators.

This is a common theme for younger children, although the better books of this nature are definitely copyrighted, so this would be a GFDL'd version of the traditional alphabet primer. '''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Big bold&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''' words should be used within the text, both to emphasis that this is for younger children, and to help make it easier for these children to read this book. Words should be kept very simple, and drawn from lists of common words (like the top 200 words of the English language, for example).   
    
*Comments:   
    
:Before starting new suggestions for the Age 8-12, what about the youngster out there who start to learn? We suggest to start with elementary pictures and the Alphabet.

:This is one book that is going to be surprisingly difficult to write, not because the content is going to be difficult to obtain but because it is going to need many, many images (essentially a picture book) and writing for younger audiences is something that has proven difficult for many Wikijunior contributors. The scope of the project is very clear, however, and initial steps can be fairly straight forward. There is likely going to be some debate over what to put up for the items in this book, and dealing with letters like X and Q is going to be a problem simply because there are so few words that you can use. The traditional X word like [[w:Xylophone|Xylophone]] is likely going to be inevitable, but it would be nice to find something different. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:12, 4 April 2006 (UTC)   
    
::I have been thinking about this book. At first I agreed that it would be hard. After mulling it over and looking at some of the alphabet books around my home, I have changed my mind. It does not need to be overly complicated to create. We do not even need to be too concerned with big words, as long as the words and accompanying pictures are interesting and are age-appropriate. Most kids reading an alphabet book want pictures they can recognize in a general way and to see that the word with the picture starts with the same letter. A great addition would be to add a sound file for each picture saying the word.    
    
::Oh, and don't worry about Q. As a mom that named one of my children with a Q name and is forever having to play name games, I know there are plenty of Q words that can be used....Queen, Quint (the fruit), Quad (as in off road or 4), Quintuplets, Quiet, Quarter (as in can I have a $, or half of a half)....--[[User:Starchildmom|Starchildmom]] 06:19, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

*Scope of project: Educate children to the order Cetacea. Provide information about intelligence, echolocation, anatomy, etc. of whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Many children find these creatures fascinating.   
*Comments:   
:What about naming this simply '''Wikijunior Sea Mammals'''? OK, that would extend the scope to seals, otters, and other creatures as well, but that isn't necessarily a huge problem. Still, the emphasis on cetatians might be a useful limit to the scope of this book. There are a number of species that can be added for each major category listed here, and this is a very interesting book. Certainly a worthy companion to [[Wikijunior Big Cats]]. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 20:51, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

*Scope of project: Teach kids about cnidarians, invertebrates which are often mistaken for plants (coral/anemones) or fish (jellyfish). It's a topic that is often not mentioned in kids' magazines, and yet there's so much to know about these animals.
*Comments:
Very interesting subject. The title should not be simply Cnidarians, but something with a subtitle like &quot;Cnidarians: Stingers of the Sea&quot; so that kids are not frightened away by the disgustingly hard to read word on the cover. [[User:MiltonT|MiltonT]] 23:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
:&quot;What are their characteristics?&quot; is a very broad question. I think it should be broken down into questions like &quot;What do they eat&quot;, &quot;What do they look like?&quot; &quot;Where do they live?&quot;. --[[User:Xixtas|xixtas]] 03:06, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Programming for Kids ===
This is something that's been discussed at [[Talk:Programming for Kids]]. This is an opprotunity to introduce kids to something they probably know nothing about, and will actually be quite useful.

*Comments:
:: I would like to start this page as a wikijunior project because I want to create a book or series of books for young children about technologies that drive development at a basic level. Therefore I believe the project would be accepted by the Wikijunior guidelines. I would like to start it soon, if possible, but before I do I would like to receive comments from the wikijunior community. I am also not sure if the name is correct, I was also considering Rural Technologies; any other ideas would be greatly appreciated. --MJBT 19:49, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

::: I have started this book as a general Wikibook; I finally chose the title [[Technologies for Rural Development]]. If you are interested in the project please add to it there. --MJBT 14:03, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

*Can present either as [[Radiation_Oncology/Leukemia/ALL|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia]] (ALL) or as lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL)
*Lymphoblastic lymphoma seen more commonly in children and adolescents -- account for 1/2 of pediatric lymphomas. 
*May spread to gonads or CNS &quot;sanctuary sites.
*Can be either T-cell precursor or B-cell precursor:
*Precursor B-cell
**Most commonly presents as [[Radiation_Oncology/Leukemia/ALL|ALL]], rarely as LBL
**Commonly bone marrow failure; clinical signs pallor, fatigue, bleeding, fever, infection; labs cytopenias
**Extranodal sites commonly involved (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, CNS disease, testicular enlargement, cutaneous infiltration)
**Adverse features: very high WBC, symptomatic CNS disease, unfavorable cytogenic abnormalities (eg t(9;22))
*Precursor T-cell:
**Commonly high WBC counts, mediastinal mass, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly
**Can present with bone marrow failure, although typically less severe than precursor B-cell ALL/LBL
**Common presentation is young men with mediastinal mass/pleural effusions
**CNS involvement common</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Burkitt's Lymphoma'''&lt;/big&gt;
==Overview==
*Burkitt's lymphoma and Burkitt cell leukemia (BL) are classified as different manifestations of the same disease by WHO
*It is a highly aggressive B-cell neoplasm, typically with extranodal presentation
*Epidemiology
**In children: 30-50% of lymphomas
**In adults: ~1 of lymphomas
**Male predominance 3-4:1
*Burkitt's lymphoma has several subtypes: 
**Endemic (young children, Africa, associated with EBV and translocation of the MYC gene)
**Sporadic (older kids, not associated with EBV but has MYC translocation)
**Immunocompromised hosts
**Burkitt's-like lymphoma (older age, not associated with MYC gene)


==Clinical Presentation==
*Endemic
**Prevalence 100/1,000,000 children
**Typically presents with jaw or facial bone tumor
**Common extranodal spread to bone marrow, meninges, mesentery, ovary/testis, kidney, breast
*Sporadic
**Prevalence 1/1,000,000 children
**Typically with abdominal presentation, often with massive bulk and ascites
**Extranodal spread as above, including CNS spread
*Immunocompromised
**Typically involves lymph nodes, and may present as acute leukemia 
**Frequently in patients with high CD4 count and no opportunistic infections
*Burkitt-like lymphoma
**Typically involves lymph nodes, nasopharynx, or GI tract
**High propensity for bone marrow and CNS as above
**B-symptoms in ~30% patients
*All types tend to have very high serum LDH, and serum electrolyte imbalances


==Pathology==
*On microscopy has &quot;starry sky&quot; pattern (generated by phagocytic histiocytes engulfing apoptotic nuclear debris)
*Medium-sized cells, very high mitotic fraction, frequent apoptosis
*Translocation is chromosome 8 &lt;i&gt;myc&lt;/i&gt; locus with 3 possible partners (accounting for 90% of translocations):
**The Ig heavy chain region on chromosome 14 : t(8;14) 
**The kappa light chain locus on chromosome 2: t(2;8) 
**The lambda light chain locus on chromosome 22: t(8;22). 
**However, 5-10% of DLBCL also have t(8;14) translocation. Because DLBCL is 20x more prevalent in adults, having t(8;14) creates a diagnostic challenge between Burkitt's and DLBCLC
*Originates from germinal center B-cells (like [[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/DLBCL#Subclassification|Germinal B-cell DLBCL]], but has different molecular signature)
*Distinction between Burkitt's lymphoma and [[Radiation_Oncology/NHL/DLBCL|DLBCL]] is imprecise. Gene profiles appear to differentiate the diseases better
**Only 53% concordance among expert hematopathologists
**Molecular signatures: 17% and 34% of Burkitt's cases (see below) were classified by pathologists as DLBCL
**WHO committees suggest the following
***If morphologic features are intermediate, diagnosis of Burkitt's should only be made if the Ki-67 fraction of viable cells is at least 99 percent. 
***If morphologic features suggest DLBCL, but have with a high proliferation fraction or t(8;14), they should be classified as DLBCL. 



*'''Charite, 2006''' (Germany) PMID 16760442 -- &quot;A biologic definition of Burkitt's lymphoma from transcriptional and genomic profiling.&quot; (Hummel M, N Engl J Med. 2006 Jun 8;354(23):2419-30.)
**Gene analysis. 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Molecular Burkitt's lymphoma (mBL) signature developed: 58 gene set. Some patients with this signature had morphologic appearance of DLBCL
**5-year OS: mBL 75%, GCB-DLBCL 51%, ABC-DLBC 12%
**&lt;i&gt;Myc&lt;/i&gt; locus survival: breakpoint 15% vs. no breakpoint 44%
**Conclusion: molecular definition of Burkitt's lymphoma

*'''Molecular Profiling Project, 2006''' PMID 16760443 -- &quot;Molecular diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma.&quot; (Dave SS, N Engl J Med. 2006 Jun 8;354(23):2431-42.)
**Gene analysis. 303 patients with aggressive lymphomas, 25 pathological Burkitt's. Gene profile developed. Some samples submitted as DLBCL had molecular profile of Burkitt's
**Survival (28 patients): better with intensive chemo vs CHOP (SS)
**Conclusion: Gene-expression profiling is accurate to differentiate BL and DLBCL


==Treatment==
*Intense chemotherapy such as [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|CODOX/IVAC-M]] necessary; [[Radiation_Oncology/Chemotherapy_combinations|CHOP]] insufficient
*Prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy or chemotherapy that crosses BBB essential
*Adults benefit from intense pediatric protocols, but often do not tolerate side effects
*Risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome is high
*Complete remission rates very high, but ultimate cure rate less than DLBCL
**Long-term survival may be as high as 50-70% in selected patients
**Bone marrow or CNS involvement results in poor prognosis, with long-term survival 0-30%
*RT was initially used for patients with initial CNS involvement, but use now is minimal</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I also posted this on Waitak's talk, perhaps he's going to be intersted in working together with you, perhaps not. You wanted a Mongolian book, here is my offer, it counts for you to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hey Waitak,

I heard you were interested in a Mongolian wikibook? I'd be glad to help in this project, and actually have some recources that might be useful to you. Look here how I'm doing the [[Uzbek]] book. I also have the Peace Corps books in Mongolian, and can get you the pdf's if you'll make a commitment to do the same thing for them that I have been doing with Uzbek. It's quite a lot of work typing it in, you can't just copy and paste. --but you might learn some Mongolian in the process.

Let me know on my talk page if you are interested.

==Re: Image Sources and the General Welcome==
Thanks for the information regarding the image - I was pretty much as fresh as they come when I uploaded that image but after a couple of days of familarising myself I have started to grips with the basics. Many thanks for the offer of help - i'll be back if I come across any difficulties. --[[User:SamEEE|SamEEE]] 20:46, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== You are so right! ==
I doubt I could have put it better myself!  I've not been here at all long (but have been quite active) but getting used to the differences has taken time (one I particularly love - don't ask why &quot;speedy deletes&quot; aren't speedily deleted - you will be told that the name doesn't mean they will be dealt with speedily!!!).  That said I like it.  It is way less strict and formal than Wp and the folk are pretty good.  Hopefully you will stick around but you will get to know folk, there really are many and there is plenty of housekeeping to do if you want to get involved.  For example if you are used to WP you will know that there are as many RC patrollers as there are vandals &lt;g&gt; - here you are in contact with around 50% of the active RC team!  Take that as a hint if you feel inclined - tho traffic is different too, 500 showing on RC will be about 12 hours quite often.  Anyway I will quit rambling and do some work but stick around and help - it would be good.  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 08:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

== I did tell you! ==
About [[Sap sd]] - I agree however the procedure/speed here just ain't like WP.  There is a very laid back approach to housekeeping generally here (however I'm up for admin and do intend to do some cleaning, so rest assured the deletions WILL take pace &lt;g&gt;) and not that many people to do it.  For your info the qr-em tag is kind of neat - basically it allows the author 7 days (or much longer) to turn nothing much into a stub at least.  After 7 days it auto becomes a speedy (also avoids biting newbies).  Do keep looking for stuff tho and bring it up somewhere/somehow - there are some darl corners around.

=== Techy bits ===

Feel free to run AWB with some caution.  There are so many pages badly cat'd (categorisation is a subject I want to raise when I get time).  Check you have the latest version (they do update often, and I must do the same).  As I said I created the page for typos but maybe check how recently I updated it. AWB does not like WB's habit of using links in titles either - take care on that (&amp; possibly other diffs).

Scripts - there are some great ones on WP - still surprises me how few people here use them - I am basically lazy, if there is any easy way - great.  Popups is my fave tho, first thing I did here - live preview is wonderful.  If you find any useful ones feel free to let me know.

=== WB bits ===

Bear in mind I'm still fairly new too. I am something of a deletionist but I am begining to be a little more tolerant. AFAIK all unlicensed images are due for deletion (uploaded prior to 1st Nov) so i wouldn't worry too much about them - I think it is a &quot;bot&quot; job - as such I'm not sure listing them is good use of your time.

Good find on the Halo ones - I think they are del ones.  I'll run it past a more experienced admin first I think - deleting pages is fine - &quot;books&quot; are way different.  I did say there were dark corners here (well intended to but it came out as &quot;darl&quot;!).

Refactoring/policy - hum!  This place isn't strong on policy.  My view FWIW would be that the page needs arc'ing and I would clear any dealt with junk to the archive page (if I understand you correctly).

Naming - needs attention in many books.  Can tag it but I tend to do any that I see while I'm there as it were?

As stated above - policy isn't a popular topic here (look in the lounge arcs at some of my earlier peices!).  However I would love to get some guidelines underway for external links.  The view is that they are probably ok (not mine) - I see them as merely a subtle form of vandalism, I'm sure some are ok but some pages are nothing short of dire (for a reader) - spam welcome at [[User:Herbythyme/Over EL pages]]!.  I'd be happy to have any input at [[User:Herbythyme/poss el policy]].

Hopefully you've slept and this answers at least some of your questions - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:13, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

== Re cats ==

Good work and use of AWB - could you look at making most (not necessarily all) cats you come across to be &lt;nowiki&gt;[[category:Whatever|{{SUBPAGENAME}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as this will correctly alpha cat stuff - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 19:24, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

== More ==
Thats good work on cats and cleanup stuff generally.  Cats are something that - to me - require quite a bit of attention.  Quite a few are created and used without much thought (there is nothing much in the way of guidance so not that surprising).  It is one I want to dig into a bit deeper but help/input would be more than welcome (&amp; it would be great use for AWB - feel free to vote for my bot account BTW on RfA page!).

By &amp; large Wikijunior looks pretty good with a top page in the overall category and then subpages in the category for the book (alpha cat'ed in previous work by me).  However looking a bit wider that really does not seem to have been the way cats are usually used.  An entire book '''may''' be cat'ed at what to me is the top level (or indeed not at all).  While I think it would be good to get some action I think some discussion should take place (I hoped to get one going at [[Category talk:Main page]] but de nada).  However [[:Category:Main page]] is a good place to explore from a look at some of the frankly daft inconsistencies.  Feel free to get back to me if you want more of my thoughts or anything.  It certainly makes for interesting browsing - for example WTF is SPM - ok I read the page but the title is hardly helpful.  While it would be a manual job as far as I can see the &quot;How to&quot; pages could be better cat'ed in my view (but mine is only one view).

Yours to me - images aren't my strong point but you are right to get this one going.  I'll certainly look at it as soon as I can - I take it the speedies you have marked you have checked out (look like they should belong somewhere but the editor is inactive at pres)?  If so I'll del them as soon as I hear from you.  Cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 13:07, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== Categories ==

Just wondering, what reasons you have for changing categories for example from '''Programming''' to '''Programming textbook pages'''? I think we might be working against each other, because I've been moving pages away from categories ending with '''textbook pages'''. I just noticed, so thought I would try to get with you on this, so we can resolve any differences of opinion and start working together rather then against each other. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:04, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

: At first I disliked the idea of having the '''textbook pages''' categories, but then I thought it might be convenient, especially in categories with a lot books, such as [[:Category:Computer programming|programming]]. Then the relevant subcategories, such as (i'm naming these off the top of my head) programming in the windows environment (not a book, but a category of books), server-side programming (containing books on php, asp, etc.), would be more easily accessible, and the textbook pages would be conveniently in that one '''textbook pages''' category.
: I know that one could argue that then the textbook pages are less accessible. But that is why, for general programming wikibooks, we keep the top pages of the wikibooks in the main category (in this case '''programming''').
: Anyways, that is what I was thinking. Did I even make sense? =\ I rarely do. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 02:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:: I can understand trying to divide a category into smaller subcategories. I don't think having textbook in the category is needed to do that though. From what I've see each book should have a category by the same name as the book in which all its pages should go. The first page (that is the top level page in which all the subpages/chapters are located) is then additionally located in some other category. In the case of Programming, I've been focusing my attention so far on {{bad link|Category:Programming languages}}, but I think {{bad link|Category:Programming}} should be cleaned up to have just the {{bad link|Category:Programming languages}} category with the varies language categories located within {{bad link|Category:Programming languages}} category and any subpages fixed to not include either one. What do you think? I hope I made sense. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:05, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

::: ''Aside:'' I agree that most of the programming wikibooks should be in the '''programming languages'''. ''Now:'' I'll explain the circumstances that made me entertain the idea of having a '''[name] textbook pages''' category schema. I was working in the [[:Category:Microsoft Windows|Windows]] category. It has two multi-paged wikibooks, several single-page wikibooks, and one category. The child category, '''[[:Category:Windows XP|Windows XP]]''', has two one-page wikibooks and one multi-page wikibook. All the multi-page wikibooks have their top-level page in their respective category in addition to the top-level page and all the other pages are in the eponymous category. But that causes confusion in the parent cat, '''Windows'''. Then two categories are &quot;wikibook pages&quot; categories, while the other is a normal category. I was confused as to what to do. When I saw the '''Programming textbook pages''' category, I was sure I found the answer. I haven't moved any of the '''Windows''' wiki-sub-cats into their own '''Windows-related textbook pages''' cat yet, but I was originally planning to. That is why I thought having a '''[name] (text/wiki)book pages''' cat would be appropriate. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:14, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: Ok first I've been doing too many edits. I haven't been changing things to programming languages as much as I thought. Must of been some other categories. However I think its a good idea to organize it regardless of the fact I haven't been doing it as I previously thought.
:::: I don't think I understand the issue with the Windows-related categories. the top-level page of each book probably should be in Windows category, and the category by the same name as the books probably should be categorized to have Windows as its category. Could you explain what the issue is your trying to fix? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:39, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: When I got to the category, it was a mess. I cleaned it up by removing all but the top-level pages from the category (standard) and then moving the top-level pages of the three xp-related wikibooks to the '''windows xp''' category. The problem is that, in the '''windows''' category, there are two categories that only contain pages of their eponymous wikibooks, and there is one category ('''windows xp''') which contains the top-level pages of three wikibooks. That is the problem.
::::: I thought it would be remedied by creating a &quot;Windows-related wikibook pages&quot; category, because then there would be two distinct type of categories--a regular category and a wikibook-page parent category. That way, if any more Windows-family wikibooks are created, the '''Windows XP''' category wouldn't get swallowed and lost in a bunch of wikibook-page categories. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:47, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

:::::: The category as it is now looks good, so you've done a good job. :)
:::::: Do you intend for the Windows category to be a general category for all Windows related books? If so I don't think there's any need to further categories the two categories that are present at this time.  Subcatagories I think are generally only created out of a current need, such as because there are a ton of books in the category. Your bit about &quot;That way, if any more Windows-family wikibooks are created&quot;, sounds like a mistake I've made a few times, trying to prevent some potential future catastrophe through fortune telling of a future even which hasn't come to pass yet. The best advice I can give is don't worry about it until it becomes a problem, if it becomes a problem, just as you helped to fix the Windows category, you or someone else may come up with a solution to fix it then. Also don't worry about problems that &quot;might happen&quot; and just focus on current ones. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:16, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

I like the double colour close!  And particularly the fact that someone has at last closed the (!) thing.  Closing the others would be lovely.....  I'll happily close stuff but not my area of expertise or interest.  I think the closing template is accepted &quot;policy&quot; now.  Kinda started by me, improved by Dragontamer and tidied by Darklama!  You probably should look at the strategy to archive VfD which has changed from standard page arc to sub page which should make it easier to find stuff later (I think you may be aware of it but just in case.

== Suggestion ==

There is actually another approach with time that can be done that probably wouldn't cause a problem with caching that involves using subst. When this was being discussed, people seemed to like the idea of having timed delay templates. The perticular reason for the approach taken was it allowed new users to develope the text futhor and not have to remember to remove the tag and if not left unattended again for a period readd for speedy deletion. With the other approach, people would have to remember to remove the tag otherwise it would remain in speedy deletion regardless of any edits. I went with what people wanted and seemed to work. There may be improvements I could make to the current approach. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:57, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== WB:RFA ==

I've nominated you for adminship on [[WB:RFA]]. Voting will commence once you accept your nomination (and I hope you choose to do so). We certainly may not agree on many things around here, but I cannot deny that you are working for the greater good, and that you want the best for this project. You've taken upon yourself a number of difficult, time-consuming, and often thankless jobs (such as the image tagging), and I would like not only to thank you for that, but also draw community attention to your admirable efforts. Talk to you later. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 04:27, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

== Your decline==

Hi Iamunknown! I hope you won't take my comments the wrong way... you do a lot of great work for the wikibooks community, I just felt that you hadn't been around long enough to get a proper feel for that &quot;gray area&quot;. If you decide later that not having the tools is driving you crazy (i.e., the admins aren't cleaning up the messes you point out fast enough), let me know via email, and I'll nominate you again. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:08, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

== Images question ==

I asked Herby this question and he referred me to you, so I'll ask: is the fact that an image is orphaned and licenced under fair use a good cause for speedy deletion? How long do you think one should reasonably wait before tagging such an image (I've tagged a few already that were over 2 years old, but as I get into newer ones the question will become less clear). If it IS a good cause, should I/someone make a motion to change the deletion policy to reflect this? Thank you for your time. Reagards.[[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 19:24, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

: I didn't even realise that there wasn't a criterion for speedy deletion that covered orhpaned fair use images. I've created a proposed amendment at [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy/Image amendment]]. Consider looking at it. I think it may pass readily; it is already standard process to nominate orphaned fair use images for speedy deletion.

: As for time, as policy is now, I would suggest tagging them on sight. It would be appropriate to notify the uploader and perhaps leave a note on the talk page of wikibooks who would have interested contributors. We may wish to expand the amendment to do something like Wikipedia's seven-day categories, so it gives the uploaders or other interested Wikipedians seven days to do something with the image.

: Thanks for asking. Stay in touch. Cheers, [[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 22:25, 23 December 2006 (UTC)

::It looks like the right idea to me, I think we should make a mention of it on the staff lounge to get more opinions, though you're right it does seem to be standard, sensible practice to do this. I'm just a policy nut, I don't like doing anything there's not a policy for! (though I'll confess sometimes there's too much policy, in the case of wikibooks it's often not enough, and/or is very scattered, as I'm sure you know). I'll tag them, I'm not sure if there'd be any remaining books interested in using many of them, since they look like they came from an intended or a deleted video game manual, the likes of which tend to be deleted and/or transwikified recently. But isn't there kind of a contradiction between tagging the image for speedy and contacting people to see if they're interested in the image anyways? I agree that the 7 day thing would be more reasonable, though we may need to give a longer time than that since we have more scattered input than wikipedia would. Regards, [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 03:51, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

::: That is a contradiction. And it is probably unnecessary; on Wikipedia, at least, it isn't done. But I still think it is a good idea to notify the uploader.
::: I hope, and the administrators have been deleting the images I tag. With attention to amendment and hopefully a successful amendment, other users might become aware of this. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:05, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

Guessing you are both watching this one. I agree with what has been said basically (&amp; I've been deleting them but I am a bit that way inclined!).  I do think if the editor is current some period should be allowed after a talk page message.  I also feel a mention in the staff lounge would be good - however bear in mind that much &quot;policy&quot; is made on the hoof!

== Move (btw, txs for your support) ==

I'm off to bed now, and I will post a more extensive message later today, but can you provide me the logic of you being against a move (of the posts) ? I can see many valid points for a move and only one disadvantage (well a copy and paste would also work but a message that the conversation was moved and there is a problem with people archiving that kind of pages etc...) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:48, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

: Good night! Hope you sleep well, and happy new years! I'll be going to bed soon too.
: I agree that it is a good idea to copy and paste the conversation from the main page to a more appropriate talk page. Please feel free to do so. But I also advocate leaving the conversation in its original place with (1) a link to direct users to the new place where you paste it and (2) a link back to its original spot from the the new spot. That way the context of the original conversation is not lost and it can continue (as it seems it will) in a more appropriate spot.
: And no problem for the support. :D I agree with some of your reasoning and conclusions. I especially agree with (1) what I perceive to be your resistance to hastily creating policies just for the sake of creating policies and (2) what I perceive to be your recognisal that there is a lot of pushing and shoving by some admins to pass policies and make decision where there is not exactly consensus.
: Again, have a Happy New Years! Best wishes to you and yours! [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 05:46, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

I hope you also passed into a marry New Year...

''Move vs Copy-paste''

If one moves a discussion all intervening parties are automatically informed that a changes has occurred, as the text will be missing, not so on copy-paste, on a move all not productive text is removed to a dedicated forum (generating an aggregation of information on the same topic without leaving breadcrumbs all over), the other problem is the achieving of duplicated text (on pages that do archive discussions), the other point you raise are similar to both situations you could propose a guideline that would address this kind of problem, (for instance remember my talk page) I only archive post that I think will have relevance in the future, if someone posts on my talk, I probably will move the post to his talk and reply there (as he gets informed on logon of a new message) and star monitoring his talk page for subsequent replies. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:25, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

: You may, theoretically, do whatever you want to on your talk page, as it is your talk page. I am currently opposed to moving text around ''en masse'' from other pages, however, because it separates the discussion from the context and is unnecessary. Specifically, while all involved parties are automatically informed that a change has occurred if the text is moved to a dedicated forum, they are also automatically informed that a change has occurred if a conspicuous link is appended to the original discussion directing them to the new forum. I would prefer and encourage the latter as it creates the least change. It is the path of least resistance. &amp;mdash; [[User:Iamunknown|User:Iamunknown]] 06:14, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

== Re: [[User:Flonejek]] ==

Sorry about the late reply. I had sent this user an email in the past when the whole image deletion thing started. He replied saying that all his images had been created by himself, and that they could be licensed appropriately. He seemed like he was on the level, but sometimes I can be too trusting. If you have suspicions about the images, feel free to mark them for deletion. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:09, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

: Thanks for your kind words. I am kind of dismayed with current events. When I first came back to Wikibooks it was easier to be involved with a lot of different aspects herein. But lately, so many huge policy discussions and users frustrated with each other and it seems like there is no time to do it all anymore. And if I try to be involved, then I can't actually contribute. Maybe that's the way it'll go. It certainly is that way on big projects like Wikipedia.
: Oh, and a request: if you could look at [[:Category:NowCommons]] and delete a few images there. Especially the flags. They are driving me nuts, because I tagged them a while ago and they are still sitting there. I'm crazy like that. &lt;code&gt;:-D&lt;/code&gt;

Hi Iamunknown. Yup, those images need to be sourced. Unfortunately the same user had claimed PD on an image that was definitely not PD a few months ago as well. Someone left him a message about it two days ago... if he doesn't reply within a week or so they should probably be speedied. 

As a rule, we need to know the source for any image (fair use, PD, or otherwise). Just putting a tag on something doesn't do the trick unless it's being posted by the creator.

== Image deletion question ==

Hi Iamunknown, I tagged an image as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Nowcommons|ImageName.ext}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but my question is if the same image is under two different licenses (this one was under PD on WB but GDFL on Commons), is it still OK to delete one and leave the other one?

Also, is there any way to be SURE that it's the same image, other than inspection of dimensions and such?

Thank you. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] 01:26, 13 January 2007 (UTC)

== From Wikilibros ==

Hello Iamunknown.

I am a wikiescritor at the Spanish Wikibooks version. Currently, I am writing the English language book, which I am trying to write in English and Spanish (using a two-column format). Since I am not a native English speaker, I am sure that I am doing mistakes, especially those related to word misplacing and subject-verb agreement, problems that an English speaking person would notice just reading a page of the book. I think I also have a tendency to form sentences and phrases which a native English speaker would not say or will find weird. Hence, it would be great if you could take a look at the book. 
There are pages not written by me, but there is no problem with theme for they are in Spanish. Probably I will translate them or even replace them by pages with the format described above. 

Once you take a look at the book, you will see the way I work (or, because of the lack of material, get, at least, a little idea of it). I say that because, if you like it, I can help you somehow with the Spanish book here.

I will be waiting your answer.

Thank you. Your friend [[es:Usuario:alephcero|Alephcero]] ([[es:Usuario_Discusión:alephcero|Consultame]]).

== XHTML images and files ==

Thanks for contacting me about those images and XHTML files. I'd like to license those under the public domain. However, I don't really know the exact procedure for doing so; could you do that? I don't check my user talk very frequently anymore (it was just a coincidence that I got your message), so respond to me at microdan -at- gmail -dot- com if there's a problem with this. [[User:LittleDan|LittleDan]] 19:49, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

You'd be surprised how much in the Ada.pdf is automatic from LaTeX however.

::::Wikiversity is looking more for content than cleanup these days :).

== Re:Wikiproject Authority ==

My purpose for this is not to grant this particular wikiproject with any additional &quot;authority&quot; over this or that page, but instead to create a dedicated group of people who are willing to do it. The [[Wikibooks:Featured books]] page hasnt been maintained recently, especially now that we aren't doing BOTM or COTM anymore. It used to be that once a book won either set of voting, the name of that book would be added to the featured books page. If we aren't doing BOTM or COTM, we need a new mechanism for keeping this page up to date. 
Notice also that any wikibookian can be considered a member of any wikiproject, without having to &quot;register&quot; or anything. In other words, we can say that anybody who does update the featured books page can be considered a de facto member of that project. Also, the establishment of that wikiproject page as a centralized discussion area for maintaining the featured books list will only help to ease a process that had too many questions before. 
What we have now is:
#a dedicated place for discussing these books, creating criteria, and voting
#a place for people to get together as a community, instead of individuals just trying to promote their own books
#a standardized mechanism for finding books, judging them, and advertising them
The wikiproject has authority because the members have authority to make changes and '''be bold'''. If you don't like the wikiproject idea, i suggest you propose something better. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:06, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

:If you don't like my solution to the problems, or if you think i've misdiagnosed the problems entirely, that's fine. I dont and cant expect everybody to agree with everything I do. If you are not interested in it, you certainly don't need to join ''any wikiproject'' at all. You are, however, still allowed to make changes to pages as you see fit, being a perfectly bold and good-natured wikibookian. My recent agenda is the creation and expansion of these new wikiprojects, and since they are based on volunteerism, I dont think we need to get any community concensus to establish them, or to maintain them. People join if they want, and dont join if they dont want, and it shouldnt change the ability of any wikibookian to accomplish any goal. Some people seem to think it would be helpful, and I agree. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:13, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

No. If it's a bother to have it template space I can userfy it, but ASP cite is where I'm listing citations for a chapter of the book, and the DSMCites follow the recommended verbiage for direct quoting the DSM for free usage.

== Electronics Images ==

I'd be happy to take a look at these images for you. Small subsets of the untagged images are a managable problem, but as you are finding out yourself, tagging all the untagged images is a very large (and possibly overwhelming) problem. I think I should be able to take care of all these images, I think there might be suitable replacements on commons. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:58, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

== Notes ==

I'm very agitated tonight, and I think that the more messages I write, the less friendly they will become. Before i send out any more emails or messages on this issue, I've solicited some opinions from other members, and am going to take some advice before I do anything else. 

On that note, what are your opinions on this matter? You and I tend to disagree so frequently, that you might bring a fresh perspective to the table. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:57, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

: I agree that the current goings-on have made the atmosphere here at Wikibooks very tense and agitating. And honestly, I am unsure what the original scope or intent of the arbitration proceedings were. I read the correspondence on the mailing list archives and on various talk pages, but that didn't help out. It appears / I think that the whole process went much faster than Robert anticipated, and I agree that now it seems to be dragging on, particularly because Rob has not been around lately.
: I do not hold anything against Robert. I do not think the arbitration proceedings were misguided. Robert recognized what he perceived to be a problem, and he tried to help out. He didn't want the proceedings to spill over into other domains, which I think was a good point. In the past, from what I have read, higher intervention from Jimbo was devastating. And from the number of Wikibookians at the beginning of 2006 compared with the number at the end of 2006, it certainly appears that was the case.
: I just don't know what to do in regards to Panic's behavior. It is not inherently reprehensible, but it is at least socially reprehensible. To be blunt, he has made the working environment miserable: it is unfriendly, agitating, confusing, and frustrating for many people: for contributors to both C++ wikibooks that have existed, in particular darklama, James Dennett, and paddu; for administrators, including you, SBJohnny, darklama (again), Rob; and for the general wikibooks contributors, which at least I can attest to.
: I don't want to step on Robert's toes, and so I don't think that the proceedings should be closed immediately. I don't think Panic would buy into that, even though the proposal you made is likely better than anything the arbitration proceedings will result in. And I cannot imagine what Robert will do when he comes back. From reading the mailing list, he appeared to hope that the issue would work itself out; well, it hasn't. Panic is as argumentative as ever and the proceedings have brought Wikibooks to a stand-still.
: I probably shouldn't say this on-wiki, but here goes: If I had to make a choice, I think I might ban Panic indefinitely. He is a valuable and vigorous contributor. But there are (were) two valuable and vigorous contributors (James Dennett and darklama) who have been ousted and exhausted by him. I'd rather have two contributors than one. I wish I could believe that just working with Panic would work out. But I don't. People have tried talking to him, working with him, posting at this request for comment, and arbitrating. The preliminary results from the arbitration appear to say that '''none''' of these will work.
: That being said, I do not think any action should be taken with at least talking to Robert. If he is willing to continue the arbitration, then he should. If his absence is at all indicative of an unwillingness to continue (which I highly doubt), then take whichever action you will.
: Voilà...my thoughts. Finally. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:32, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

== RePanic ==

I wasn't afraid of it, i knew it was going to happen. I told rob when he started the arbitration that when panic didn't get his way, he was going to make an appeal to the next highest authority.

First, I am happy that you think I have the authority (or perhaps the &quot;charm&quot;) to ask people to cease and desist whichever projects they have been working on. I do understand your frustration with the whole image problem. And while we are on the subject, I would like to personally thank you for your efforts in this area. It's a project that is as tedious as it is unglamorous, and you certainly deserve some sort of pat-on-the-back, or a barnstar, or whatever it is that we give each other as a sign of respect.

== Re:Notes and Images ==

I share your frustration in many of these issues, and before I try and give you any answers or solace, I would like to remind you that you are just a volunteer here. Even though we all have great visions and plans for this place, if you stress yourself out, burn out, and stop contributing (i've seen it many times before), all your hard work and the time you spent stressed out and frustrated will have been wasted. In short, don't worry too much, and don't work yourself too hard!!

I agree with you about the frustration in not having a finite image policy (or even a policy that has rules, and not just helpful tips) is a big problem, and one that this community has never been eager to address. The issue of fair use is a difficult one as well, although I have very mixed opinions about it. I think that fair use images are a bad idea, because of the extra licensing and permissions that need to be worried about. However, fair use text excerpts serve an important part in many books, especially annotated texts. All things considered, I would like to mandate that ''all images must be uploaded to commons'', and that no images should be allowed to be uploaded here. I doubt highly that such a rule will ever be accepted here, no matter how many problems it would solve in the present and the future. 

As to Javascript, I would not call myself an &quot;expert&quot; on the topic, and I might not even go so far as to call myself &quot;adept&quot;, &quot;proficient&quot;, or even &quot;literate&quot; in Javascript. What little JS I've been able to write was typically heavily adapted from scripts that other people have written, with a little improvisation drawing from my experience programming Java and C++. Anything I can write, you can likely write faster and better. If you absolutely need help with some Javascript, you might do well to ask [[User:Darklama]]. He's helped me with many of my scripts.

If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to ask. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:54, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

== [[:Image:Collapse.gif]] ==

G'day mate, what are your thoughts on this image? I thought maybe it was a {{tl|free screenshot}}, but it has text on it (really basic, generic PHP, but still, text that someone's typed in). Similarly, [[:Image:Fig2.gif]] which is further down the [[PHP fhp - what you'll need|same page]]. Also, any further news on [[w:Template:GFDL-presumed]]?

: From my understanding, because Notepad++ is licensed for use under GPL, the interface, icons, etc. that are produced ''solely'' by the program (as in when you first load the program) are also under the GPL. (It could get tricky that this program is programmed with Visual.net and compiled with a Microsoft-owned compiler, but I would recommend safely assuming that we won't be held liable.)
: The insignificant but non-software related edits (the arrows, etc.) could be licensed under any license, but I think we could justify licensing them with PD-ineligible ''unless'' we want to adopt Commons' &quot;best practice&quot; policy of ''demanding'' sources even when the image is obviously ineligible for copyright (which I would approve of).
: So in regards to Image:Collapse.gif, if the collapsing tree is not a product of the native Windows functions, I think that it would be licensed under GPL for the interface. The manually-added arrows and text would be PD-ineligible. We should consider recreating it and reuploading it, though, so we can explicitly release rights. (I'll do it later this week if I have time unless you want to.)
: I don't know about Image:Fig2.gif. I think that if the interface is specifically the product of a Microsoft product (which I think it is), it would qualify as fair use.
: I think the fair use license you gave [[:Image:Npp.logo2.gif]] is appropriate. I looked through the entire Notepad++ CVS at Sourceforge, downloaded the source to double check, and installed the program: the logo from the website is not used in any fashion in the program. And I can find no evidence on the website that the logo is licensed for free use.
: On Template:GFDL-presumed, I just haven't copied it yet. I'll do that right now. I hope it won't cause a stir with other users. Whiteknight and darklama were the only folks on IRC when I asked about it. I'll just do it and see where we go from there. Finally, sorry for such a long reply. :( --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 04:51, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

::Firstly, I don't think that the compiler has anything to do with the licensing of screenshots of the text editor - Notepad++ is licensed by GPL, which should be good enough.
::Secondly, it sounds like maybe you have the two images confused with each other. Collapse is a screenshot of Notepad++ showing some trivial PHP code in the editor, and demonstrating the .NET-style collapsing contexts, whereas Fig2 is a screenshot of some folders in the Windows Explorer, either directly in Windows or in a Save As dialog window within Notepad++. 
::The issue with Collapse is whether there is a problem because of the code shown. The code in question is completely trivial PHP, but previous chats we've had led me to think that maybe that doesn't matter here &amp;ndash; which is basically where my question was going: is this code trivial enough to allow the screenshot to be classed as free under GPL, or does it need a separate license?
::I reckon that the Fig2 image should be fair use, but you may be right about the annotations. I won't get in your way if you want to recreate it before the weekend, but if you don't, it's mine on Saturday (Aussie time)!
::I'm looking forward to using GFDL-presumed, especially on the many chemistry-related images, and some electronic circuits. I reckon that it makes sense. If it gets a knock, then I guess Visio will be busy again...

:::Here goes:
:::# Robert and others have mentioned before that owner of the copyrights to a compiler technically own part of the rights to the compiled program and thus part of the rights to the program output. I'd have to find the case citations they mentioned. It is ridiculous, however, that we would be held liable for distributing otherwise free software that was compiled with a non-free compiler.
:::# Let me clarify regarding Image:Collapse.gif. If the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; graphics are part of the native Windows interface, then the screenshot would be in part fair use. I am, however, unsure whether the collapsing lines (not tree) are part of the native Windows interface. If the collapsing lines and the associated iconography are freely licensed, then the screenshot at large would be licensed under the GNU GPL license, and the trivial PHP code and added arrow would be licensed under whatever license the licensor decided (although IMO it is ineligible for copyright).
:::# (see above)
:::# Regarding Image:Fig2.gif, a separate license would need to be specified for the native Windows interface (fair use) and then added arrows (PD-ineligible or PD/PD-user/PD-self).

::::# The &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; graphics are not part of Windows ''per se'', but are part of the .NET support libraries; Notepad++ was written in .NET and uses its presentation services, which is where it borrows the collapsing contexts from.

If we need to have a license for it, then we are dependent on the original uploader to qualify the licensing situation and cannot help them in this instance. Thus, they must fix it or lose it.

== New Media Art book ==

Hi, you commented on the New Media Art book (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/New_Media_Art) that I'm working on putting up on Wikibooks. 

I've been putting together a wiki-version of an academic art book called New Media Art, by Mark Tribe. Mark teaches an entire course based on the book at Brown University, and I know it is used in classes at other institutions. I started to put it up on wikibooks, since that seemed to be where it fit best (rather than wikipedia or wikiversity). You can see the content so far at: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/New_Media_Art. I was soon warned by two editors that it was not appropriate content -- that it was encyclopedic/macropedic and thus not a &quot;textbook.&quot; Though the content of the book is structured in an encyclopedic way (a series of sections, each on a particular artist or artist group), it can still be considered an art historical text. The introduction, for instance, gives a broad overview of the New Media art tradition and ties together the artists discussed in the rest of the book. I've already been told that the content I've put up so far will probably be deleted. Where does this book belong, if not in wikibooks?

Your help is greatly appreciated! I'm new to the whole wiki communication thing, but I think you can leave me a comment on my &quot;talk&quot; page: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User_talk:Lblissett

== Telescope Making ==

Hello iamunknown.  Where have I seen that moniker before?  I thought I would post a quick note here just to let you know I am back and will be working on the Telescope Making book again.  I have a draft of the first of the materials pages and once it is spell checked I will post it.

The images seemed to read better, at least I thought so, than the formula wrapped oddly with text.  It is really moot to me, just so the average reader can understand what I am trying to say.  I will be posting pictures of the process of making the mirror.  I had planned to use the PNG format as it is the smallest I have found.  Will that work for you?  I need to flesh out some of the earlier chapters in regards to the links explaining unknown topics.

I changed some of the edits you did with the formulas, leaving the formulas, they are nice, and moving the text away from them.  I also posted the next section on finding the materials for the mirror.  I tried to stay within the layout that you have started for the book.

== Ooopsie ==

This is not a gripe, or criticism, but information and communication... but... I wish you hadn't done [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Wikipedia_templates_used_on_category_pages&amp;action=history this!]-- any such 'Wikipedia' (Project name prefixed) category could have been (as is in process elsewhere, probably in Meta) more generally as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{SITENAME}} templates_used_on_category_pages]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. But NBD... I'm sure you were just doing some cleanup tasks.

I think I've seen your edit trails in other clean-up tasks and (I believe) in creations of other red linked categories I'd left red links pending a more stable picture ala the various sisters. [[W:WP:TSP|WikiProject template sharing]] hasn't even been announced because of such loose ends--''some sites get cranky'', in particular if you start messing with their categories &lt;g&gt;-- ''so I'm very glad it was you, rather than me.'' NBD-- let me be the first to congratulate you on your forthcoming adminship, and figure on deleting that once you get your sys-op bit. No hurry -- there never is off the main namespace pages of any wiki! (That whole set of templates needs overhauled, which process has been started in ones and twos, but is very back burner. Should be able to update the whole set by months end once categorization issues are addressed--the real hold up in all [[M:MP:TSP]] matters, which in turn is delayed by the new versions of {{tl|interwikitmp-grp}} and {{interwikicat-grp}}, again, in process. Hah! See, Haven't even imported the later here yet! See Meta's here: {{tlxm|interwikicat-grp}}. Being a mature long established sister, I was treading lightly, plus your general category names match very well with the set we're currently working with, and so forth, so there was little need.)
 

As it turns out, TSP and I had the influence on Wikipedia to get many 'SITENAME' prefixed names 'Omitted' to enhance portability during the recent ''templates categories re-organization'' on WP, so this one is just going to be ''[[w:Category:Templates used in categories|Templates used in categories]]''... 'Templates used on category pages' is now both a combined soft and hard redirect pending the new category redirect system software that is in '{{wpd|Beta Test}}'. (Keeping track of seven sister's category usage is at times confusing, that's why the new templates will do that instead.) 

{{Tl|Commonstmp}} itself will be relatively unused for the most part hereafter, as {{Tl|interwikitmp-grp}} has the broader job. In the main, it will be relegated to tagging specialty templates that are used on the Commons and whichever sister sites has dual or at most three way needs. For example: {{tlxc|Middle Ages by region}} was just [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AMiddle_Ages_by_region&amp;diff=4761894&amp;oldid=4749894 converted] for selective and strategic tagging of categories and galleries on the Commons, whereas it is in wide use on Wikipedia where it originated. 

It may have some scope on Wikisource (I haven't looked into that yet), and perhaps someday, here, given enough source books. Hence it's not a good candidate for being interwikitmp-grp tagged at the moment. So that's what the older little tags will have as a new role in the scheme of things. I'd like to invite you into the TSP project. It's actually a bit past the time that I should involve others outside Meta/Commons/Wikipedia (though, that's a good start but for the contributors are 'occasional' and not heavily involved. Maybe they just have confidence in me? Nice thought, that! &lt;G&gt;) But help and local knowledge are certainly now needed, so how about it. From what I can see, the categorization of templates here is badly in need of some maintenance and systemization similar to that we just reorganized on Wikipedia (Many templates still need recatted, but the category structure is now in place, and sensible.) 

The other part of that is local knowledge of templates with wide applicability or potential is and would be very useful. You need not be a template guru (I'm not really) to be able to reason that a template might have a use on such and such sister site. No more do you have to be a genius to help document such tools, so that others can find them. The name of the game as far as I'm concerned is enhancing the productivity of other editors... a good thing that--we're all volunteering time after all, and helping people maximize there efforts helps the foundation's projects and other people -- both many times over. Not a bad thing at all.

== Personal Attacks ==

I am not sure about why I am the target for such huge personal attacks, particularly on my user page.  Yes, I think there is a huge amount of misunderstanding going on at the present, and most of this is miscommunication.  And it is my belief that it stems back to what happened with my getting involved with first getting involved with the arbitration process and then my backing Panic.

This has come to the point that I'm not even really sure I want to stick around here on Wikibooks anymore.  The one and only reason I would like to stay here is to perhaps take some of these arrows from these young hot heads and have them pointed at me instead of at somebody else, but something must be done about the civility of the discussions that are taking place here on Wikibooks.

This simply must end somewhere.  I don't know if this is going to require some outside intervention, or if this is going to be the tone of this project from now on.  I know this is just a small handful of contributors here, and perhaps I should take that into perspective.

Any effort you can do to inject some civility into these discussions and to try and discuss rational differences of opinion on the various issues that have been raised would be appreciated.

In terms of dealing with the &quot;ban on fair use&quot;, I did mis-read the date that the images needed to be deleted as 2007 instead of 2008, and I havn't been given a chance to apologize on that point.  Philosophically, I also disagree with Whiteknight that we need to ban any fair use uploads to this project without a formal EDP in place, but I don't know how to express that opinion without causing a huge firestorm of discussion here either.  I do realize that he acknowledges his mistake of modifying the proposed fair use policy in so drastic of a manner, and it appears that my understanding of his position on this issue may also be off.

Anyway, you have been a voice of calm and reason throughout all of this, and I appreciate this moderate tone you have displayed.  Other than reminding people to be civil in their discussions, I'm not asking anything more from you.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

: Robert, thank you for your kind note.  I assumed that Whiteknight's note on your talk page was a culmination of a series of misunderstandings.  In all my interactions with you and in reading your posts to various Wikimedia-related venues, I remain convinced that you have every intention to improve Wikibooks.  Same with ever currently-active contributor on Wikibooks.  While each individual may have his or her own opinion about editorial- and content-management, my wish is that we not let that get in between constructive dialogue.

: I sometimes feel that by pointing out the subtle distinctions between ethical choices and opinions I am perceived as wikilawyering.  That is not my intention.  There is a very real distinction and, unless they are pointed out, one argument is severely weakened.  If a group can agree on an ethical code then any unethical action is simply wrong; if a group disagrees on opinions unrelated to ethics then a given action is not necessarily wrong.

: I also find the widespread mistrust of others' intentions both here and on Wikipedia disturbing.  I have read multiple documents regarding the concept of &quot;assume good faith&quot;, but feel that they fail to address what should be done.  It is my opinion that every contributor who demonstrates that they intend to improve Wikibooks should not be deemed a vandal or a troll.  I admit that I have grown tired in the past of Panic's actions.  I regret that I have.  Panic may be a tendentious editor, but the galvanizing calls that he is a &quot;bad-faith editor,&quot; a &quot;troll&quot; or a &quot;vandal&quot; are, in my opinion, baseless.  He has demonstrated that he has every intention to improve the C++ wikibook.

: While there are certain benefits related to maintaining a small community such as at Wikibooks rather than a large community such as at Wikipedia, I find the drawbacks frustrating.  At Wikipedia there are a variety of opinions and the variety of sensible opinions are rarely in a minority.  Thus sensible people can disagree and not easily be shut down or insulted without rational discussion with other such people.  Here at Wikibooks there are few active contributors to policy-related discussions and it seems that you, who maintain a different, valid and sensible but different opinion, are subject to personal attacks.  I'm sorry that you are and I am sorry that I have not been around more often.  I maintain what I consider to be valid opinions about proposed Wikibooks policies, philosophies and processes but have felt resistance since day one when I came back in November.

: Robert, I would understand and respect your decision to leave if that is what you choose.  I know that you have real-life obligations to deal with including jobs, family and society.  But I hope that you do not decide to leave.  I appreciate your knowledge of Wikibooks-history and your knowledge of copyright law.  I appreciate your detailed posts and what I perceive as your support for a &quot;Wikibooks is not ''just'' for textbooks&quot; model.  I am afraid that I will be the lone contributor who maintains a similar philosophy if you leave.

: I hope that I may remain calm and reasonable.  I find that I re-read many of my posts; sometimes I do not post what I first wrote up because I decide that it will either not help Wikibooks or it is unnecessary and will only serve to drive a wedge between relationships.  And, again, thank you very much for your kind note.  I will continue participating in discussions and, hopefully, bring them down to their proper level where opinions can be considered based on their merit and not be necessarily disregarded as &quot;wrong&quot;.  --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 06:56, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

'''Sofrito''' is a combination of ingredients used to give a distinctive flavor to many [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] dishes. It is mostly used when cooking legumes, rice dishes, soups and stews. The two main ingredients that give sofrito its characteristic flavor are: ''recao'' (also known as culantro) and ''ají dulce''. Ají dulce may be substituted for bell peppers. Sofrito is also traditionally made with salted [[cookbook:pork|pork]], [[Cookbook:Ham|cured ham]], and [[cookbook:Lard|lard]]. When pork is used the sofrito is cooked before storing.

The following recipe has no pork and therefore it is not cooked before storing. This allows for a quicker preparation and also makes it [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian ]] friendly. 

==Ingredients==

Yield: 1 quart

*5 stems of fresh [[Cookbook:Culantro|recao]] leaves (culantro), chopped
*1 small bunch of fresh [[cookbook:cilantro|cilantro]], chopped
*3 Large plum tomatoes seeded and chopped 
*1 head of [[cookbook:garlic|garlic ]] 
*2 large Spanish yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], chopped
*15 [[Cookbook:Ají dulce|ají dulce]], seeded
*1 large red bell peppers, seeded
*3 large cubanelle peppers, seeded

==Procedure==
#Grind the ingredients in a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]] or [[Cookbook:Food Processor|food processor]], and store in the refrigerator or pour into ice cube trays to store in the freezer.

* Two or three sofrito cubes can be used in recipes that serve 6 to 8 people that require sofrito.

'''Ají dulce''' (from [[cookbook:South American cuisines|South American]] Spanish ''ají'', &quot;chilli&quot; + ''dulce'', &quot;sweet&quot;) is any of a variety of sweet perennial peppers found in Latin America and the [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]]. It is most widely known in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Venezuela|Venezuela]] where it refers to a specific native variety of ''[[w:Capsicum chinense|Capsicum chinense]]'' related to the [[cookbook:habanero|habanero]], but with a mild, smoky flavour.

In [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], the ''ají dulce'' is grown commercially and is an important ingredient for sauces, such as [[cookbook:sofrito|sofrito]] or &quot;mojito isleño&quot; (a fish or meat sauce).

[[Image:Hombay3.jpg|right|thumb|Culantro]]

'''Culantro''' (also known as '''Bhandhanya''', '''Chandon benit''', '''Culantro''', '''Culantro Coyote''', '''Fitweed''', '''Long coriander''', '''Mexican coriander''', '''Wild coriander''', '''Recao''', '''Spiritweed''', '''Ngò gai''', '''Sawtooth''', and '''Saw-leaf herb'''), is the leaves of the herb '''''Eryngium foetidum'''''. It is native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]], but is cultivated worldwide.  In the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], where it is not well-known, the name culantro sometimes causes confusion with ''[[Cookbook:Coriander|Coriandrum sativum]]'', the leaves of which are known as ''[[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]]''.

Culantro is widely used in seasoning and [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinating]] in the [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]]. It is also used extensively in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thailand]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Vietnam|Vietnam]], and other parts of [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asia]] as a culinary herb. This variety of coriander dries well, retaining good color and flavor, making it valuable in the dried herb industry. It is sometimes used as a substitute for [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]], but has a much stronger taste.  

Medicinally, the leaves and roots are used in tea to stimulate appetite, improve digestion, combat colic, soothe stomach pains, eliminate gases and as an aphrodisiac.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I agree with cross referencing. Technical analysis is more often focused on short term movements in stocks and generally unrelated to the underlying health of the company represented by the stock. Brokers profit more from technical analysis than stock traders. [[User:Jmoorejr|Jmoorejr]]

yes technical analysis would make it more valuable.

No, they should be cross referenced only at the beginning of each because they represent diametrically opposed investing methodologies.  Hard core technicians sometimes consider fundamental analysis a waste of time.  Hard core fundamentalists consider technical analysis &quot;Voodoo.&quot; Either view can be successsful alone or in combination.  The problem is how much weight to give to each and even that relationship is subject to large and frequent revisions.

There are some who believe that fundamentals should dictate what to buy and technical anlysis when to buy.  While I believe the two should be used together for selection as well as timing of investments it is too much like trying to combine physical science with astrology or faith.

The best approach is to introduce each methodolgy as one of many alternatives and state that each has strong advocates.  I know one investor who makes selections based on the timing of storage activities by squirrels.  Then there are the annual articles touting the talents of monkeys with dart boards exceeding professional money managers results.  As a fan of both TA and Fundies I confess to buying occasional lottery tickets even though I know my chances of being struck by lightening are six times better than winning.</text>

'''Rot''' is a symptom that can have many causes, such as bacteria, fungi, or nematodes. The organisms that cause rots can either be the primary infectious agent, or more commonly opportinistic organisms that enter through wounds or following infection by other pathogens. 

==Symptoms and Signs==
Rots are grouped by the part of the plant affected. 

*'''Damping Off''' describes the rotting of seeds or young seedlings, especially in flats.
*'''Root Rots''' affect the root system, and are frequently lethal. They are most common in wet soils, particularly among plants not adapted to wet conditions.
*'''Crown Rots''' affect the crowns of herbaceous plants, where the root system meets the stems and foliage. Crown rots often appear when a plant's crown has been covered by mulch or leaves.
*'''Stem Rots''' affect the plant stems.
*'''Cambium Rots''' affect the cambium layer of woody plants, leading quickly to wilt.
*'''Wood Rots''' affect the internal woody tissue of woody plants.
*'''Fruit Rots''' affect the fruits, either while still on the plant or more often post-harvest.

==Rot-causing Organisms==


==Controls==
{{Phytopathcontrol|
| Exclusion = Avoid wounding plants.
| Cultivation = Ensure well-drained soils. 
| Cultural Controls = Ensure good air circulation. Rotate to crops not affected by known pathogens of any affected crop.

'''Mosaic''' is the symptom of a number of plant viruses, perhaps the most familiar being [[../Tobacco Mosaic Virus/]], which affects a wide range of hosts. 

==Symptoms and Signs==
Irregular blotching of differently colored patches on the leaf, often with different colors in interveinal parts of the leaves. 

==Transmission==
Like any virus, transmission requires a vector (usually aphids) but human activity (such as pruning or grafting) can also transmit the viruses. 

==Host Range==


==Controls==

      <comment>Corrected spelling of [one hundred]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Counting is often the first thing one wants to learn when visiting another country.

==0 to 10==
0. nul
#één
#twee
#drie 
#vier
#vijf
#zes
#zeven 
#acht
#negen
#tien

Notice that the cardinal 1 (one) is usually written using stress marks as één to distinguish it from the unstressed indefinite article een (English a or an). However stress marking is an optional thing in Dutch and the marks are not always written.

Zeven is sometimes pronounced as &quot;zeuven&quot; [zøvə(n)] to distinguish it better from &quot;negen&quot;.

==11 to 20==
As in English the first two are irregular; they betray an ancient suffix -lif as in English.
:11. elf
:12. twaalf

The rest has -tien as a suffix with a few irregularities

:13. ''der''tien
:14. ''v'''e'''er''tien
:15. vijftien
:16. zestien
:17. zeventien
:18. achttien
:19. negentien

==20 to 100==
The equivalent of -ty in English is -tig.

:20. ''twin''tig
:30. ''der''tig
:40. v''ee''rtig 
:50. vijftig
:60. zestig
:70. zeventig
:80. '''t'''achtig
:90. negentig

The &quot;z&quot; of zestig and zeventig are usually pronounced as [s], not [z].

==21, 66 etc.==
In contrast to English the units come first

:21 eenentwintig  (&quot;oneandtwenty&quot;)

If the unit ends in a vowel and this collides with the vowel of &quot;en&quot; a diaeresis (trema) is used:

:22 tweeëntwintig

==100, 200==
In contrast to English, Dutch just uses &quot;hundred&quot;, not &quot;one hundred&quot;

:100. honderd
:101. honderd-en-één
:200.  tweehonderd
:201. tweehonderd-en-één
:300. driehonderd
:400. vierhonderd
:500. vijfhonderd
:600. zeshonderd
:700. zevenhonderd
:800. achthonderd
:900. negenhonderd

==1000 to 100,000==
This basically goes the same. Notice that Dutch uses periods as separators for factors of one thousand rather than commas. This notation is the reverse of the English one. Dutch has a decimal comma, not a decimal point. 
:1000. duizend
:1001. duizend-en-één
:2000. tweeduizend
:5000. vijfduizend
:10.000. tienduizend
:20.000. twintigduizend
:50.000. vijftigduizend
:100.000. honderdduizend

For years the 'honderd' is often dropped, similar to English:

:In 1355: in dertien vijfenvijftig.

==Large numbers==
:1.000.000. één miljoen
:1.500.000. één miljoen vijfhonderdduizend
:2.000.000. twee miljoen

For larger numbers Dutch uses the [[:w:Long and short scales|long scale]] rather than the [[:w:Long and short scales|short scale]], which is currently used in all English-speaking countries. There are two suffixes -joen and -jard that alternate.

:1.000.000.000. miljard

:1.000.000.000.000. biljoen
:1.000.000.000.000.000. biljard

:1.000.000.000.000.000.000. triljoen
:1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000. triljard

==Decimals==
Remember that Dutch uses a decimal comma rather than a decimal point. 

:6,7%: zes komma zeven procent.

==What writing system(s) does this language use?==
Turkish uses the Latin alphabet, just like English. However, the alphabet is slightly different.

This is the Turkish alphabet:
Aa Bb '''Cc''' '''Çç''' Dd Ee Ff Gg '''Ğğ''' Hh '''Iı''' '''İi''' '''Jj''' Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo '''Öö''' Pp Rr Ss '''Şş''' Tt Uu '''Üü''' Vv Yy Zz

All the bold letters sound different from English, and you may have also noticed that Turkish doesn't have the letters '''Qq''', '''Ww''' or '''Xx'''.
'''Cc''' sounds like the '''j''' in '''j'''am.
'''Çç''' sounds like the '''ch''' in '''ch'''ocolate
'''Ğğ''' doesn't have a sound, but just lengthens the vowel before it.
'''Iı''' does '''not''' sound like an English ''i'', as a matter of fact, it doesn't even have an English equivalent. To make this sound, imagine a British person saying ''urgh'', but a '''shorter''' version of it. That's an '''ı'''. Just don't forget, it's '''dotless'''!
'''İi''', however, is dotted, including the capital letters! It sounds like '''ee''' but '''shorter'''.
'''Jj''' sounds like the '''s''' in trea'''s'''ure.
'''Öö''' sounds just like the German '''ö'''. A close English equivalent is the '''i''' in b'''i'''rd.
'''Şş''' sounds like the '''sh''' in '''sh'''ake
'''Üü''' sounds like the '''ou''' in y'''ou'''.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|equivalent|equal in value, measure, force, effect, significance, etc.}}

==How many people speak this language?==
Turkish is the native language of about 70 million people, but worldwide about 100 million people can speak Turkish altogether.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|native speaker|someone who learned to speak a language as a child.}}

==Where is this language spoken?==
[[Image:MapofTurkishspeakers.png|left|225px|thumb|A map showing the number of Turkish speakers in each country.]]
Turkish is the official language of the Republic of Turkey ([[Wikijunior:Europe/Turkey|click here to learn about Turkey]]) and the Turkish Republic of Northern [[Wikijunior:Europe/Cyprus|Cyprus]] (TRNC).  Turkish is also spoken within communities of the Former Yougoslav Republic of [[Wikijunior:Europe/Macedonia|Macedonia]] (FYROM) where at least 20% of the local population speak it.
Turkish is spoken by 2 million people in Germany due to a huge Turkish population living there.  About 800,000 people in Bulgaria and over a million people in France, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America also speak Turkish.  There are also small communities of Turkish speakers found in Greece, Russia and Azerbaijan.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|migrant|a person who moves (or has already moved) from one place to another.}}

==What is the history of this language?==
The earliest forms of the Turkish language were written in [[w:Orkhon_script|Orkhon script]].

[[Image:Ataturk-September_20,_1928.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Atatürk teaching the new Turkish alphabet to the Turkish public.]]
During the [[w:Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]], [[w:Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish language]] was influenced mainly by [[../Arabic/]] and [[../Persian/]]. The primary writing system was based on Arabic and Persian script. Due to the difficulty of learning the language only about 10% of the Ottoman Turkish population were literate.

However, in 1928, modern Turkey's greatest hero, [[w:Mustafa_Kemal_Ataturk|Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], had changed many things about the Turkish language. He changed the writing system to a Turkish variant of the Latin alphabet (without the letters Q, W or X, and added the letters '''Ö''' from Swedish, '''Ç''' from Albanian, '''Ş''' from Romanian, and '''Ü''' from German; and also added the letters '''Ğ''', '''I''', and '''İ''' to represent certain sounds which weren't present in any other Latin-based languages at the time), and replaced many old Turkish words with new loanwords.

The change of the writing system heavily benefited Turkey's youth, and during the 1930s, the literacy rate shot up to 70%. Today, the overall literacy rate for both males and females is approximately 87%.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|literate|Someone who is literate knows how to read and write.}}

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|youth|a young person/people.}}

==Who are some famous authors or poets in this language?==
[[Image:Nasreddin.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Nasreddin Hoca riding a donkey.]]
Turkish literature is very rich, and stretches back even before the time of the Ottomans.

An example of a pre-Ottoman literary figure is [[w:Nasreddin Hoca|Nasreddin Hoca]], who is famous for his funny stories. Nobody really knows whether he existed or not, but there is a lot of proof. His tomb (which, although has a door with a huge padlock on it in front of the tomb, has no walls), can even be found in the town of [[w:Akşehir|Akşehir]] in Turkey. 

An example of an Ottoman literary figure is [[w:Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu|Aşık Veysel Şatıroğlu]], but everyone just calls him Aşık Veysel. He was a famous minstrel and a poet. As a child, he became blind in both eyes. His father gave him a [[w:Saz|saz]], a Turkish instrument, and recited many poems to him. As he was growing up, he devoted himself to playing the saz and singing songs, and ended up becoming a saz virtuoso. Unfortunately he had a very tough life (in addition to being blind, almost his entire family died, and his wife ran away with another man). His songs are like poems and mostly sad, but are very beautiful and touching.

After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, Turkey underwent a huge modernization process, making it the most Westernized country in the Islamic world. [[w:Orhan Pamuk|Orhan Pamuk]], one of Turkey's most successful authors, has also written many successful books, such as ''Kar'' (''Snow''), and ''Benim Adım Kırmızı'' (''My Name is Red''). In 2006, he became the first Turk to win the Nobel Prize, and won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

==What is a simple song/poem/story that I can learn in this language?==
===Delivering a khutba===
&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;'''O'''&lt;/big&gt;nce, Nasreddin was invited to deliver a khutba. When he got on the minbar (pulpit), he asked &quot;Do you know what I am going to say?&quot; The audience replied &quot;NO&quot;, so he announced &quot;I have no desire to speak to people who don't even know what I will be talking about&quot; and he left.

The people felt embarrassed and called him back again the next day. This time when he asked the same question, the people replied &quot;YES&quot;. So Nasreddin said, &quot;Well, since you already know what I am going to say, I won't waste any more of your time&quot; and he left.

Now the people were really perplexed. They decided to try one more time and once again invited the Mullah to speak the following week. Once again he asked the same question - &quot;Do you know what I am going to say?&quot; Now the people were prepared and so half of them answered &quot;YES&quot; while the other half replied &quot;NO&quot;. So Nasreddin said &quot;The half who know what I am going to say, tell it to the other half&quot; and he left!

&lt;p&gt;— by '''Nasreddin Hoca'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
===Mini Bir Kuş===
Mini Bir Kuş is a Turkish nursery rhyme. This is the Turkish version of it:

&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px&quot;&gt;
Mini mini bir kuş donmuştu&lt;br&gt;
Pencereme konmuştu&lt;br&gt;
Aldım onu içeriye&lt;br&gt;
Cik Cik Cik Cik Ötsün diye&lt;br&gt;
Pır pır ederken canlandı&lt;br&gt;
Ellerim bak boş kaldı
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is the translated version into English:

&lt;blockquote width=80%; style=&quot;background:#f4f4ff; border: 1px solid #999; border-right-width: 2px&quot;&gt;
A tiny tiny bird got frozen&lt;br&gt;
It perched on to my window&lt;br&gt;
I took it inside&lt;br&gt;
So that it could sing like jick jick jick jick&lt;br&gt;
When it heard a purring sound it got excited&lt;br&gt;
Look at my hands they're empty now&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It sounds silly in English because the lines don't rhyme, unlike in Turkish.

If the following text appears as nonsense or boxes, you may need to enable Persian on your computer:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeeee;&quot; | '''{{FAchar| زبان فارسی }}'''
|}

Sometimes it is necessary to make a page display properly by manually changing the encoding of the browser. In Firefox, follow '''View''', '''Character Encoding''', '''More Encodings''', '''Middle Eastern''' and then '''Farsi'''. 
== Typing in Persian ==

=== Windows Vista ===

=== Windows XP ===
To enable typing in Persian in Windows XP, follow these steps. You will need administrator rights on the computer on which you wish to enable Persian typing, therefore if you are on a  network (such as at work, University or school) you may need to contact your network administrator. You may also be prompted to insert your Windows disk.

1. Go to '''Start''', then go to the '''Control Panel''' and click on '''Date, Time, Language and Regional Options'''. 
2. Click on &quot;Add other Languages&quot;.
3. Click on '''Details'''.
4. Click on '''Add'''.
5. Select '''Input method''' as &quot;Farsi&quot; and for '''Keyboard layout/IME''' select &quot;Farsi&quot; from the menus.  

The langage bar will appear on your screen, enabling you to switch between Persian and your default or other languages. If you do not have the Persian alphabet on your keyboard, and only have a Latin alphabet, you can use the on screen keyboard to input Persian. The on-screen keyboard can be found by following '''Start''' then clicking on '''Accessories''', '''Accessibility''' and '''On-Screen keyboard'''. It is also possible to buy Persian keyboard stickers, or you may find that you can memorize the positions of the varios letters.

[[Image:Quinoa.jpg|right|thumb|Milled, organic quinoa]]

'''Quinoa''' (pronounced keen-wa) is a pseudocereal grain originating in [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]]. The seed heads are naturally pest resistant as the seeds are coated with saponins which must be washed off before eating. The resulting saponin-laden water is useful for cleaning. 

Quinoa is a very nutritious grain with a high protein content (12%-18%) and, unlike other grains, has a well balanced profile of essential amino acids. It is naturally [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]], and is a good replacement grain for people who are avoiding wheat in their diets.

Quinoa can be cooked like any other grain; the taste is mild and slightly nutty. It is readily available from health food stores and many standard grocery stores.

==Preparation==

Before use, quinoa must be soaked to remove the saponins; this step is not necessary for some packets of quinoa which have been pre-soaked for convenience. Soak quinoa in a bowl or pot, totally covered with water, for 3 to 4 hours, then discard or reserve the soak water, and replace with fresh water to soak a further hour or so.

After the soaking preparation, quinoa can be prepared much like white rice. 

# Add one cup of quinoa to two cups of water, and bring to a boil.
# Lower the heat, and simmer on the lowest heat setting for 16-18 minutes.
# Set aside off the heat for five minutes before serving.

==Hello==

I'm new at wikibooks, is it OK to translate the books from English Wikibooks into other languages, with mentioning in the translation text, that it is a translation with reference to the main source? Namely I'm going to read now about lucid dreaming and thought I could as well translate it into other language as I go along. Please answer on this page, I'll pop in later to collect your answer. Thank you:) [[User:213.48.73.89|213.48.73.89]] 14:15, 7 July 2007 (UTC)

==Sorry that I haven't responded promptly==

I haven't logged in for a few months, but the answer is yes, as long as you get permission from the creator (r3m0t) I've seen him post here and there, but it may take a while. I recommend posting on the main Lucid Dreaming discussion page. If you want to reach me faster, use egendreau@smes.org. I check it very regularly. May I ask what language you will be translating to?

== Re:Offering to help ==

I got your message, new help is always appreciated! The various engineering disciplines arent the most popular subjects here on wikibooks, in many cases i'm the only author working on them at all! To see all the computer engineering books (or at least all the books that have been properly categorized) check out [[Subject:Computer Engineering]]. All of those books need some degree of help, and are likely to be important topics of study for you in school. I dont know that there are any specific grunt work tasks that need to be done on them, but check them out and see what there is, what needs to be improved, etc. If you have any questions, let me know and I will try to help. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:14, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

I haven't gotten very far in it, but I thought I'd thow another reality check at you.  It works...most of the time.
Gravity.  I've found that when sleeping, particularly close to morning, I have full use of my inner ear, so noting which way is &quot;down&quot; according to my inner ear usually tells me whether or not I'm awake.  (I can remember one fail, out of...untold successes.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

A '''hazard''' is an error in the operation of the microcontroller, caused by the simultaneous execution of multiple stages in a pipelined processor.

There are three types of hazards: Data hazards, control hazards, and structural hazards.

== Data Hazards ==

Data hazards are caused by attempting to access data or modify data simultaneously. In the MIPS design, the result is written back to the register file at the same time that another instruction decode stage is reading the register file. There are three basic types of data hazards:

;Read After Write (RAW): In these hazards, the read process happens after the write process, although both processes happen in the same clock cycle. If the write process takes a long time, it may not complete by the time the read occurs, which will produce incorrect data.
;Write After Read (WAR): In a WAR hazard, the write from a previous instruction will not complete before the successive read instruction. This means that the next value read will be a previous value, not the correct current value.
;Write After Write (WAW): WAW hazards occur when two processes try to write to a data storage element at the same time. If this occurs in a single clock cycle, there will be no time in between to read the intermediate value. If the instructions execute out of order, the incorrect value may be left in the register.

=== Race Conditions ===

If data hazards are not explicitly accounted for, a '''race condition''' can arise where the proper execution of the processor is a matter of timing. If things occur in the proper times and the proper sequence, there might be no problems. However, In a race condition it is frequently likely that things will occur out of order, or at different time intervals, and this will cause a problem.

== Control Hazards ==

Control hazards occur when a branch instruction is processed. While the branch instruction is traveling through the pipeline, the instruction fetch module will continue to read sequential instructions from the instruction memory. The problem is that because of the branch, the next instructions might execute out of order, which will cause problems.

== Structural Hazards ==

A structural hazard occurs when two separate instructions attempt to access a particular hardware module at the same time. 

== Fixing Hazards ==

There are a number of ways to avoid or eliminate hazards. 

=== Stall ===

A '''stall''', or a &quot;bubble&quot; in the pipeline occurs when the control unit detects that a hazard will occur. When this happens, the control unit stops the instruction fetch mechanism and puts NOPs into the pipeline instead. In this way, the sensitive instructions will be forced to occur alone, without any other instructions being processed at the same time.

[[Image:Pipeline 5.png|center|600px]]

In this image we can see &quot;bubbles&quot; drawn where data hazards occur. A bubble signifies that the instruction has stalled in the pipeline until a previous instruction completes. Once the previous instruction has completed, the stalled instruction continues moving.

Notice in this image that the yellow instruction stops at the ID stage for 2 cycles, while the red instruction continues.

=== Forwarding ===

When an result from one instruction is to be used as the input to the ALU in the next instruction, we can use '''forwarding''' to move data directly from the ALU output into the ALU input of the next cycle, before that data has been written to the register. In this way, we can avoid the need for a stall in these situations, but at the expense of adding an additional '''forwarding unit''' to control this mechanism.

=== Register renaming ===

Instead of having fixed numbers for registers, registers can be renamed or renumbered. Consider the following ADD instruction:

 add R1, R2, R1

We are adding the values in R1 and R2, and we are storing the result back in R1. What if the name &quot;R1&quot; pointed to two different physical storage areas, that is the  value is read from one location, the &quot;old R1&quot;, and is written to a new storage area, the &quot;new R1&quot;. 

Register renaming can be used to prevent hazards caused by out-of-order execution (OOOE).



=== Speculative execution ===

During a branch, it is frequently possible to &quot;guess&quot; about the outcome of the branch. By guessing about the destination, instructions can be executed speculatively. If the guess is wrong, the pipeline will need to be emptied, which takes the same amount of time as a stall. However, if the guess is right, no time is wasted and the processor continues operation as normal.

The process of guessing which way the branch will take is a complicated subject and is beyond the current scope of this book.

=== Branch delay ===

A '''branch delay''' is an instruction written in the assembly source code after the branch, that is designed to execute whether the branch is taken or not. If there are no instructions that can be executed without a dependency on the branch, then a NOP should be inserted instead. Some assemblers are capable of rearranging code in this fashion, although other assemblers that use this technique require the programmer to handle branch delays manually.

=== Branch Predication ===

In a '''branch predication''' scheme, all instructions, or most instructions in the ISA may be conditionally executed based on some condition. In other words, the instruction will be loaded from memory, decoded, and then the processor will determine whether or not to execute it. In the event of a branch, for instance, the instructions in the pipeline after the branch can be turned off if the branch went the other direction. Branch predication is very closely related to speculative execution.

=== Branch Prediction ===

'''Branch Prediction''' is the act of guessing about the direction a branch instruction will take. Typically, branch predictors base these decisions off register values, and past branch history. In a large loop, for instance, a particular program may branch back to the top of the loop many many times before the loop terminates. Consider this high-level pseudo code:

 '''while'''(condition)
     do this
 '''end'''

Which roughly translates to this assembly pseudo code:

 ''top of loop:''
 '''compare''' condition and 0.
 '''branch''' to ''end of loop'' if equal
 do this
 '''branch''' to ''top of loop''
 ''bottom of loop:''

This loop will continue to repeat until the ''condition'' flag is 0. This code will likely loop many times before the one time that it exits. In a while structure like this, it takes the branch every time except for the last time, and it only doesn't take the branch once. It makes good sense to assume, therefore, that every branch that we come to will be taken, which can increase the accuracy of our speculative execution.

{{TextBox|'''Example: Loop Optimization'''

In modern processors, branch prediction will frequently look at the history of recent branches to determine how to guess the outcome of a future branch. Consider the following loop structure with a nested conditional:

 '''while'''(loop condition)
    '''if'''(branch condition)
       do this
    '''else'''
       do that
  '''end'''

If we know statistically that the ''branch condition'' will be false (0) 90% of the time, and that the ''loop condition'' will be true (1) nearly 100% of the time. We can decompose this into assembly pseudo code:

 1) '''compare''' loop condition and 0
 2) '''branch''' to ''end of loop'' if equal
 3) '''compare''' branch condition and 0
 4) '''branch''' to ''branch true'' if not equal
 5) do that
 6) '''branch''' to ''end of if''
 7) ''branch true''
 8) do this
 9) ''end of if''
 10)'''branch''' to ''top of loop''

If we look at this loop structure, we can see that the branch on line 10 is taken most of the time. We can also see that the branch on line 4 only occurs if the branch condition is 1. We know that the branch condition is true only 10% of the time, so this loop will have bad branch prediction. A better loop in this case would be:

 '''while'''(loop condition)
    '''if'''(not branch condition)
       do this
    '''else'''
       do that
  '''end'''

so that the branch in the conditional is taken 90% of the time, so that the branch predictor will be more accurate.}}

A branch predictor typically acts like a counter. Every time a branch is taken, the counter is incremented, and every time a branch is not taken, the counter is decremented. Consider a 2-bit predictor. If the predictor is 0 or 1, the branch is not taken, but if the predictor is 2 or 3, the branch is taken.

[[Image:BranchPredictor.JPG|thumb|center|600px|A 2-bit branch predictor with 4 stages.]]

We can treat a branch predictor like a finite-state-machine (FSM) like in the diagram above. This FSM has 4 stages, corresponding to the following &quot;guesses&quot;:

*q0:Strong Take 
*q1:Weak Take
*q2:Weak Not Take
*q3:Strong Not Take

The zeros in this diagram refer to a branch not being taken, and a 1 corresponds to a branch being taken. If many branches are taken, the state moves towards the right. If branches are not taken, the stage moves towards the left.</text>

'''Exceptions''', are situations where the processor needs to stop executing the current code because of an error. In these cases, the processor typically begins running an '''exception handling routine''' to resolve the error, and then returns to the normal program flow. For instance, if the ALU attempts to divide by zero, or if an addition causes overflow, an exception might be triggered. The processor needs to stop operation and fix the error before the program can be resumed.

Some common examples of exceptions are arithmetic overflow or underflow, division by zero, or attempting to access a memory location that does not exist.</text>

An '''interrupt''' is a condition that causes the microprocessor to temporarily work on a different task, and then later return to its previous task. Interrupts can be internal or external. Internal interrupts, or &quot;software interrupts,&quot; are triggered by a software instruction and operate similarly to a jump or branch instruction. An external interrupt, or a &quot;hardware interrupt,&quot; is caused by an external hardware module. As an example, many computer systems use '''interrupt driven I/O''', a process where pressing a key on the keyboard or clicking a button on the mouse triggers an interrupt. The processor stops what it is doing, it reads the input from the keyboard or mouse, and then it returns to the current program.

The image below shows conceptually how an interrupt happens:

[[Image:Interrupt.svg|center]]

The grey bars represent the control flow. The top line is the program that is currently running, and the bottom bar is the interrupt service routine (ISR). Notice that when the interrupt ('''Int''') occurs, the program stops executing and the microcontroller begins to execute the ISR. Once the ISR is complete, the microcontroller returns to processing the program where it left off.

----

What happens when external hardware requests another interrupt while the processor is already in the middle of executing the ISR for a previous interrupt request?

When the first interrupt was requested, hardware in the processor causes it to finish the current instruction, disable further interrupts, and jump to the interrupt handler.

The processor ignores further interrupts until it gets to the part of the interrupt handler that has the &quot;return from interrupt&quot; instruction, which re-enables interrupts.

If an interrupt occurs while interrupts were turned off, some processors will immediately jump to that interrupt handler as soon as interrupts are turned back on. With this sort of processor, an interrupt storm &quot;starves&quot; the main loop background task. Other processors{{fact}} execute at least one instruction of the main loop before handling the interrupt, so the main loop may execute extremely slowly, but at least it never &quot;starves&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Degree of Freedom Analysis on Reacting Systems ==

If we have N different molecules in a system, we can write N mass balances ''or'' N mole balances, whether a reaction occurs in the system or not. The only difference is that in a reacting system, we have one additional unknown, the molar extent of reaction, for each reaction taking place in the system. Therefore '''each reaction taking place in a process will add one degree of freedom to the process'''.

{{NOTE|This will be different from the ''atom'' balance which is discussed later.}}

== Complications ==

Unfortunately, life is not ideal, and even if we want a single reaction to occur to give us only the desired product, this is either impossible or uneconomical compared to dealing with byproducts, side reactions, equilibrium limitations, and other non-idealities.

=== Independent and Dependent Reactions ===

When you have more than one reaction in a system, you need to make sure that they are '''independent'''. The idea of independent reactions is similar to the idea of [[w:linear independence|linear independence]] in mathematics.

Lets consider the following two general parallel competing reactions:

*&lt;math&gt; aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; a_2A + b_2B \rightarrow e_2E &lt;/math&gt; 

We can represent each of the reactions by a ''vector'' of the coefficients:

*&lt;math&gt; V  = [\mbox{ A coeff, B coeff, C coeff, D coeff, E coeff}]&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; v_1 = [-a, -b, c, d,0] &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; v_2 = [-a_2,-b_2,0,0,e_2] &lt;/math&gt;

[http://www.math.odu.edu/~bogacki/cgi-bin/lat.cgi?c=li This site]
{{NOTE|The site above gives a nice tool to tell whether any number of vectors are linearly dependent or not. Lacking such a tool, it is necessary to assess by hand whether the equations are independent. '''Only independent equations should be used in your analysis of multiple reactions''', so if you have dependent equations, you can eliminate reactions from consideration until you've obtained an independent set.}}

{{todo|double-check this.}}

By definition a set of vectors is only linearly independent if the equation:

&lt;math&gt; K_1*v_1 + K_2*v_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where K1 and K2 are constants only has one solution: &lt;math&gt; K_1 = K_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

Lets plug in our vectors:

&lt;math&gt; K_1 * [-a, -b, c, d,0] + K_2 * [-a_2,-b_2,0,0,e_2] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since ''all components'' must add up to 0, the following system follows:

*&lt;math&gt; -K_1*a - K_2*a_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; -K_1*b - K_2*b_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; K_1*c + 0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; K_1*d + 0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; 0 + K_2*e_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, the last three equations imply that unless c = d = 0 and e2 = 0, &lt;math&gt; K_1 = K_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and thus the reactions are independent.

==== Linearly Dependent Reactions ====

There is one rule to keep in mind whenever you are checking for reaction dependence or independence, which is summarized in the following box.

{{box|'''If any non-zero multiple of one reaction can be added to a multiple of a second reaction to yield a third reaction, then the three reactions are not independent'''.}}

Therefore, if the following reaction could occur in the same system as the two above:

&lt;math&gt; (a+a_2)A + (b+b_2)B \rightarrow cC + dD + e_2E &lt;/math&gt;

then it would not be possible to analyze all three reactions at once, since this reaction is the sum of the first two. Only two can legitimately be analyzed at the same time.

All degree of freedom analyses in this book assume that the reactions are independent. You should check this by inspection or, for a large number of reactions, with numerical methods.

=== Extent of Reaction for Multiple Independent Reactions ===

When you are setting up extent of reaction in a molecular species balance, you ''must''  sure that you set up one for ''each'' reaction, and include both in your mole balance. So really, your mole balance will look like this:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma n_{A,in} - \Sigma{n_A,out} + \Sigma a_k X_k = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for all k reactions. In such cases it is generally easier, if possible, to use an atom balance instead due to the difficulty of solving such equations.

=== Equilibrium Reactions ===

In many cases (actually, the majority of them), a given reaction will be '''reversible''', meaning that instead of reacting to completion, it will stop at a certain point and not go any farther. How far the reaction goes is dictated by the value of the ''equilibrium coefficient''. Recall from general chemistry that the equilibrium coefficient for the reaction &lt;math&gt; aA + bB \rightarrow cC + dD &lt;/math&gt; is defined as follows:

{{box|&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{C_{C,eq}^c*C_{D,eq}^d}{C_{A,eq}^a*C_{B,eq}^b} &lt;/math&gt; with concentration &lt;math&gt; C_i &lt;/math&gt; expressed as molarity for liquid solutes or partial pressure for gasses}}

Here [A] is the equilibrium concentration of A, usually expressed in molarity for an aqueous solution or partial pressure for a gas. ''This equation can be remembered as &quot;products over reactants&quot; ''. 

Usually '''solids and solvents are omitted''' by convention, since their concentrations stay approximately constant throughout a reaction. For example, in an aqueous solution, if water reacts, it is left out of the equilibrium expression.

Often, we are interested in obtaining the extent of reaction of an equilibrium reaction when it is in equilibrium. In order to do this, first recall that:

&lt;math&gt; X = \frac{-\Delta n_A}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

and similar for the other species.

==== Liquid-phase Analysis ====

Rewriting this in terms of molarity (moles per volume) by dividing by volume, we have:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{X}{V} = \frac{[A]_0 - [A]_f}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

Or, since the final state we're interested in is the equilibrium state,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{X}{V} = \frac{[A]_0 - [A]_{eq}}{a} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for the desired equilibrium concentration, we obtain the equation for equilibrium concentration of A in terms of conversion:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; [A]_{eq} = [A]_0 - \frac{aX}{V} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Similar equations can be written for B, C, and D using the definition of extent of reaction. Plugging in all the equations into the expression for K, we obtain:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; K = \frac{([C]_0+\frac{cX}{V})^c ([D]_0 + \frac{dX}{V})^d} {([A]_0 - \frac{aX}{V})^a([B]_0 - \frac{bX}{V})^b} &lt;/math&gt; 

At equilibrium for liquid-phase reactions '''only'''}}

Using this equation, knowing the value of K, the reaction stoichiometry, the initial concentrations, and the volume of the system, the equilibrium extent of reaction can be determined. 

{{NOTE|'''If you know the reaction reaches equilibrium in the reactor, this counts as an additional piece of information in the DOF analysis because it allows you to find X'''. This is the same idea as the idea that, if you have an irreversible reaction and know it goes to completion, you can calculate the extent of reaction from that.}}

==== Gas-phase Analysis ====

By convention, gas-phase equilibrium constants are given in terms of '''partial pressures''' which, for ideal gasses, are related to the mole fraction by the equation:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; P_A = y_AP &lt;/math&gt; '''for ideal gasses only'''}}

If A, B, C, and D were all gases, then, the equilibrium constant would look like this:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; \frac{P_C^cP_D^d}{P_A^aP_B^b} &lt;/math&gt; '''Gas-Phase Equilibrium Constant'''}}

In order to write the gas equilibrium constant in terms of extent of reaction, let us assume for the moment that we are dealing with ideal gases. You may recall from general chemistry that for an ideal gas, we can write the ideal gas law for ''each species'' just as validly as we can on the ''whole gas'' (for a non-ideal gas, this is in general not true). Since this is true, we can say that:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{n_A}{V} = [A] = \frac{P_A}{RT} &lt;/math&gt;

Plugging this into the equation for &lt;math&gt; \frac{X}{V} &lt;/math&gt; above, we obtain:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{aX}{V} = [A] - [A]_{eq} = \frac{P_{A0}}{RT} - \frac{P_{A,eq}}{RT} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, 

{{box|&lt;math&gt; P_{a,eq} = P_{A0} - \frac{aXRT}{V}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Similar equations can be written for the other components. Plugging these into the equilibrium constant expression:

{{box|&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{ (P_{C0} + \frac{cXRT}{V} )^c (P_{D0} + \frac{dXRT}{V} )^d} {(P_{A0} - \frac{aXRT}{V} )^a (P_{B0} - \frac{bXRT}{V} )^b } &lt;/math&gt;

'''Gas Phase Ideal-Gas Equilibrium Reaction at Equilibrium'''}}

Again, if we know we are at equilibrium and we know the equilibrium coefficient (which can often be found in standard tables) we can calculate the extent of reaction.

=== Special Notes about Gas Reactions ===

You need to remember that ''In a constant-volume, isothermal gas reaction, the total pressure will change as the reaction goes on'', unless the same number of moles are created as produced. In order to show that this is true, you only need to write the ideal gas law for the total amount of gas, and realize that the total number of moles in the system changes.

This is why we don't want to use ''total'' pressure in the above equations for K, we want to use ''partial'' pressures, which we can conveniently write in terms of extent of reaction.

=== Inert Species ===

Notice that all of the above equilibrium equations depend on ''concentration'' of the substance, in one form or another. Therefore, if there are species present that don't react, they may still have an effect on the equilibrium because they will decrease the concentrations of the reactants and products. Just make sure you take them into account when you're calculating the concentrations or partial pressures of each species in preparation for plugging into the equilibrium constant.

== Example Reactor Solution using Extent of Reaction and the DOF ==

{{example|Consider the reaction of Phosphene with oxygen: &lt;math&gt; 4PH_3+8O_2 \rightarrow P_4O_{10} + 6H_2O &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose a 100-kg mixture of 50% &lt;math&gt; PH_3 &lt;/math&gt; and 50% &lt;math&gt; O_2 &lt;/math&gt; by mass enters a reactor in a single stream, and the single exit stream contains 25% &lt;math&gt; O_2 &lt;/math&gt; by mass. Assume that all the reduction in oxygen occurs due to the reaction. How many degrees of freedom does this problem have? If possible, determine mass composition of all the products.}}

It always helps to draw a flowchart:

[[Image:Phosphate Rxn Flowchart.PNG]]

There are '''four''' independent unknowns: the total mass (mole) flowrate out of the reactor, the concentrations of two of the exiting species (once they are known, the forth can be calculated), and the extent of reaction.

Additionally, we can write four independent equations, one on each reacting substance. Hence, there are '''0''' DOF and this problem can be solved.

Let's illustrate how to do it for this relatively simple system, which illustrates some very important things to keep in mind.

First, recall that '''total mass is conserved even in a reacting system'''. Therefore, we can write that:

&lt;math&gt; \dot{m}_{out} = \dot{m}_{in} = 100 \mbox{ kg} &lt;/math&gt;

Now, since component masses aren't conserved, we need to convert as much as we can into moles so we can apply the extent of reaction.

&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{PH_3,in}= 0.5*(100\mbox{ kg})* \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{0.034 \mbox{ kg}} = 1470.6 \mbox{ moles PH}_3 \mbox{ in} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{O_2,in} = 0.5*(100\mbox{ kg})* \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{0.032 \mbox{ kg}} = 1562.5 \mbox{ moles O}_2 \mbox{ in} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \dot{n}_{O_2,out} = 0.25*(100\mbox{ kg})* \frac{1 \mbox{ mol}}{0.032 \mbox{ kg}} = 781.25 \mbox{ moles O}_2 \mbox{ out} &lt;/math&gt;

Let's use the '''mole balance on oxygen''' to find the extent of reaction, since we know how much enters and how much leaves. Recall that:

&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \dot{n}_{A,in} - \Sigma \dot{n}_{A,out} - a*X = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where a is the stoichiometric coefficient for A. Plugging in known values, including a = 8 (from the reaction written above), we have:

&lt;math&gt; 1562.5 - 781.25 - 8X = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Solving gives:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; X = 97.66 \mbox{ moles} &lt;/math&gt;}}

Now let's apply the mole balances to the other species to find how much of them is present:

*&lt;math&gt;PH_3: 1470.6 - \dot{n}_{PH_3,out} - 4(97.66) = 0 \rightarrow \dot{n}_{PH_3,out} = 1080.0 \mbox{ moles PH}_3 &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;P_4H_10: 0 - \dot{n}_{P_4O_{10},out}+ 1(97.66) = 0 \rightarrow \dot{n}_{P_4H_10,out} = 97.66 \mbox{ moles P}_4O_{10} &lt;/math&gt; (note it's + instead of - because it's being generated rather than consumed by the reaction)
*&lt;math&gt;H_2O: 0 - \dot{n}_{H_2O,out} + 6(97.66) = 0 \rightarrow \dot{n}_{H_2O,out} = 586.0 \mbox{ moles H}_2O &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the last step we need to do is find the mass of all of these, and divide by the total mass to obtain the mass percents. As a sanity check, all of these plus 25 kg of oxygen should yield 100 kg total.

*Mass &lt;math&gt; PH_3 &lt;/math&gt; out = 1080 moles * 0.034 kg\mole = 36.72 kg
*Mass &lt;math&gt; P_4O_{10} &lt;/math&gt; out = 97.66 moles * .284 kg\mole = 27.74 kg
*Mass &lt;math&gt; H_2O &lt;/math&gt; out = 586 moles * 0.018 kg\mole = 10.55 kg

Sanity check: 36,72 + 27.74 + 10.55 + 25 (oxygen) = 100 kg (total), so we're still sane.

Hence, we get:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; 36.72% PH_3,27.74% P_4H_{10},10.55% H_2O, 25% O_2 &lt;/math&gt; by mass}}

== Example Reactor with Equilibrium ==

{{example|Suppose that you are working in an organic chemistry lab in which 10 kg of compound A is added to 100 kg of a 16% aqueous solution of B (which has a density of 57 lb/ft^3) The following reaction occurs:

&lt;math&gt; A + 2B \leftarrow \rightarrow 3C + D &lt;/math&gt;

A has a molar mass of 25 g/mol and B has a molar mass of 47 g/mol. If the equilibrium constant for this reaction is 187 at 298K, how much of compound C could you obtain from this reaction? Assume that all products and reactants are soluble in water at the design conditions. Adding 10 kg of A to the solution causes the volume to increase by 5 L. Assume that the volume does not change over the course of the reaction.}}

'''Solution''': First, draw a flowchart of what we're given.

[[Image:Equilibrium Rxn Flowchart.PNG]]

Since all of the species are dissolved in water, we should write the equilibrium constant in terms of molarity:

&lt;math&gt; K = 187 = \frac{[C]^3[D]}{[A][B]^2} &lt;/math&gt;

We use initial ''molarities'' of A and B, while we are given mass percents, so we need to convert.

Let's first find the number of ''moles'' of A and B we have initially:

&lt;math&gt; n_{A0} = 10 \mbox{ kg A} * \frac{1 \mbox{ mol A}}{0.025 \mbox{ kg A}} = 400 \mbox{ mol A} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; n_{B0} = 100\mbox{ kg solution} * \frac{0.16 \mbox{ kg B}}{\mbox{kg sln}} = 16 \mbox{ kg B} * \frac{1 \mbox{mol B}}{\mbox{ 0.047 kg B}} = 340.43 \mbox{ mol B} &lt;/math&gt;

Now, the volume contributed by the 100kg of 16% B solution is:

&lt;math&gt; V = \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{100 \mbox{ kg}}{57 \frac{lb}{ft^3} * \frac{1 \mbox{ kg}}{2.2 \mbox{ lb}} * \frac{1 \mbox{ ft}^3}{28.317 \mbox{ L}} } = 109.3 \mbox{ L}&lt;/math&gt;

Since adding the A contributes 5L to the volume, the volume after the two are mixed is &lt;math&gt; 109.3\mbox{ L} + 5\mbox{ L} = 114.3\mbox{ L} &lt;/math&gt;.

By definition then, the molarities of A and B before the reaction occurs are:

*&lt;math&gt; [A]_0 = \frac{400 \mbox{ moles A}}{114.3 \mbox{ L}} = 3.500 M &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; [B]_0 = \frac{340.42 \mbox{ moles B}}{114.3 \mbox{ L}} = 2.978 M &lt;/math&gt;

In addition, there is no C or D in the solution initially:

* &lt;math&gt; [C]_0 = [D]_0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, &lt;math&gt; a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore we now have enough information to solve for the conversion. Plugging all the known values into the equilibrium equation for liquids, the following equation is obtained:

&lt;math&gt; 187 = \frac{ (\frac{3X}{114.3})^3 (\frac{X}{114.3}) } { (3.5 - \frac{X}{114.3} ) (2.978 - \frac{2X}{114.3} ) ^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be solved using Goalseek or one of the numerical methods in appendix 1 to give:

{{box|&lt;math&gt; X = 146.31\mbox{ moles} &lt;/math&gt; }}

Since we seek the amount of compound C that is produced, we have:

* &lt;math&gt; X = \frac{\Delta n_C}{c} &lt;/math&gt;
* Since &lt;math&gt; c = 3, n_{C0} = 0, \mbox{ and } X = 146.31 &lt;/math&gt;, this yields &lt;math&gt; n_C = 3*146.31 = 438.93\mbox{ moles C} &lt;/math&gt;

{{box|438.93 moles of C can be produced by this reaction.}}

Most processors and other complicated hardware circuits are typically divided into two components: a '''datapath''' and a '''control unit'''. The datapath contains all the hardware necessary to perform all the necessary operations. In many cases, these hardware modules are parallel to one another, and the final result is determined by multiplexing all the partial results.

The control unit determines the operation of the datapath, by activating switches and passing control signals to the various multiplexers. In this way, the control unit can specify how the data flows through the datapath.

The width of the data path ...

For good [[../Code Density | code density]], you want the ALU datapath width to be at least as wide as the address bus width.
Then every time you need to increment an address, you can do it in a single instruction,
rather than requiring multiple instructions to manipulate an address one piece at a time.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;It seems that the 16-bit ISA hits somehow the &quot;sweet spot&quot; for the best code density, perhaps because the addresses are also 16-bit wide and are handled in a single instruction. In contrast, 8-bitters need multiple instructions to handle 16-bit addresses.&quot;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;it just really sucks if the largest datum you can manipulate is smaller than your address size. This means that the accumulator needs to be the same size as the PC -- 16-bits.&quot;

== music theory ==

i'm not *that* interested in music theory. to be honest, rhythm is my weakest point in music. i just saw that i could improve the article, so that's what i did. it's not an obsession or anything.

as the wikibook says, it's unstable, so even if there was a specific audience, you could change it.</text>

Coolant change and flush.

A coolant flow diagram for a 1997 Jetta diesel would show coolant leaving the water pump and traveling through a 3/4 inch inside diameter hose, up the front of the engine, to the top of the engine block.  There it either takes an easy path through the wide, upper radiator hose (only if the thermostat is open) or it flows directly into the engine. Hot coolant exits the driver's side of the engine head and goes to the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) device to cool recycled smoke.  This adds even more heat to the coolant.  Next the coolant travels to the heater core in the dashboard.  Finally the rubber coolant hose exits the dashboard and joins a metal line which returns coolant to the suction side of the water pump.  Two skinny hoses direct bubbles to the top of the coolant reservoir as the system purges itself of flow-restricting air bubbles.  The bottom of the coolant reservoir is T connected into the suction line to the water pump. The thermostat is in the water pump inlet and blocks  incoming flow from the bottom radiator hose until the engine has reached the temperature at which the thermostat is designed to open 195 degrees Fahrenheit.  A corroded thermostat can get stuck open which would prevent proper warm-up. Or, A thermostat can become stuck closed, which can cause overheating and boil over.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

Taking the idea of superscalar operations to the next level, it is possible (and frequently desirable) to put multiple microprocessor cores onto a single chip, and have the cores operate in parallel with one another. 

== Symmetric Multi-core ==

A symmetric multi-core processor is one that has multiple cores on a single chip, and all of those cores are identical.

{{TextBox|'''Example: Intel Core 2''':

The Intel Core 2 is an example of a symmetric multi-core processor. The Core 2 can have either 2 cores on chip (&quot;Core 2 Duo&quot;) or 4 cores on chip (&quot;Core 2 Quad&quot;). Each core in the Core 2 chip is symmetrical, and can function independently of one another. It requires a mixture of scheduling software and hardware to farm tasks out to each core.}}

{{TextBox|'''Example: Parallax Propeller''':

The Parallax Propeller is an example of a symmetric multi-core processor. The Parallax Propeller has 8 cores on chip, each one a 32-bit RISC processor. Each core in the Parallax Propeller chip is symmetrical, and can function independently of one another.}}

== Asymmetric Multi-core ==

An asymmetric multi-core processor is one that has multiple cores on a single chip, but those cores might be different designs. For instance, there could be 2 general purpose cores and 2 vector cores on a single chip.

{{TextBox|'''Example: Cell Processor'''

IBM's Cell processor, used in the Sony PlayStation 3 video game console is an asymmetrical multi-core processor. The Cell has 9 processor cores on board, one general purpose processor, and 8 data-processing cores. The one multipurpose core, known as the '''Power Processor Element''' (PPE) controls the communication between the other cores, and distributes computing tasks to the other cores for processing. The other 8 cores are known as '''Synergistic Processor Elements''' (SPE), and are specially designed to have high floating-point throughput, especially with vector operations.}}

{{TextBox|'''Example: Kilocore'''

Rapport's Kilocore processor, is an asymmetrical multi-core processor. The Kilocore has one general purpose processor, a PowerPC processing core, and either 256 or 1024 data processing cores on-chip. The cores are designed to run at extremely low power, so the overall chip is faster and yet uses less power than typical desktop CPUs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomshardware.com/news/ibm-rapport-kilocore,2575.html Tom's hardware: &quot;IBM says Kilocore technology will outrun today's mobile processors&quot;] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;.}}

== Symmetric Multicore ==

[[Image:IntelCore2DuoE6600.jpg|thumb|right|The Intel Core 2 Duo]]

A symmetric multi-core processor is a processor which has multiple cores that are all exactly the same. Every single core has the same architecture and the same capabilities. An example of a symmetric multi-core system is the Intel Core 2 Duo processor.

Each core has the same capabilities, so it requires that there is an arbitration unit to give each core a specific task. Software that uses techniques like '''multithreading''' makes the best use of a multi-core processor like the Intel Core 2.

{{-}}

== Asymmetric Multi-core ==

In an asymmetric multi-core processor, the chip has multiple cores on-board, but the cores might be different designs. Each core will have different capabilities. 

=== Example: IBM Cell Processor ===

An example of an asymmetric multi-core processor is the IBM Cell processor.

The Contemporary Music period is the period following the [[../Modern Music/|Modern Music period]].  It is generally considered to have lasted from 1945 A.D. to the present.

Contemporary music is (in general) based on originality. Then Contemporary artists use dissonances and tried to disobey &quot;the laws&quot; that music had followed for many years.

Contemporary music is divided into a lot of sub-categories like &quot;minimalism&quot;, a style that has been explored by many artists including Steve Reich, John Adams, and Philip Glass.


{{BookCat}}
The Contemporary Era was formed during the last quarter of the nineteenth century through a painting movement called Impressionism. Around 1870 a group of French painters rejected the Romantic Era. Twentieth Century music reflects the influences of art and literature mechanistic atomic age.
The pleasant sounding  Impressionistic music led to experiments with twelve tone music. Some other experiments are with electronic music,jazz, and more.Also different people from the romantic era made variations of there songs so they could add Impressionism.Some these composers include Bartok,Stravinsky,Prokofiev, Copland,Shostakovich,Barber,and Gorecki.
The music also contains non-western melodies and leaves out romanticism.The Contemporary also introduces new scales (whole-tone,modes) and chord uses. The painting movement also is called the others. 


Some general characteristics are
(Do not apply for all compositions,only commonly found.)

# Fewer lyrical melodies than other periods.
# Dissonant Harmonies
# Complex rhythms
# Percussiveness
# Greater use of percussion,brass,and woodwind.
# Uses synthetic and electronic sounds</text>

== Cache ==

{{wikipedia|Cache}}

A cache is a small amount of memory which operates more quickly than main memory. Data is moved from the main memory to the cache, so that it can be accessed faster. Modern chip designers put several caches on the same die as the processor; designers often allocate more die area to caches than the CPU itself. Increasing chip performance is typically achieved by increasing the speed and efficiency of chip cache. 

The cache memory performance is the most significant factor in achieving high processor performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajsmith&quot; /&gt;

Cache works by storing a small subset of the external memory contents, typically out of it's original order. Data and instructions that are being used frequently, such as a data array or a small instruction loop, are stored in the cache and can be read quickly without having to access the main memory. Cache runs at the same speed as the rest of the processor, which is typically much faster than the external RAM operates at. This means that if data is in the cache, accessing it is faster than accessing memory.

Cache helps to speed up processors because it works on the '''principle of locality'''.

In this chapter, we will discuss several possible cache arrangements, in increasing order of complexity:
* No cache, single-CPU, physical addressing
* Single cache, single-CPU, physical addressing
* Cache hierarchy: L1, L2, L3, etc.
* cache replacement policies: associativity, random replacement, LRU, etc.
* Split cache: I-cache and D-cache, on top of a unified cache hierarchy
* caching with multiple CPUs
* cache hardware that supports virtual memory addressing
* the TLB as a kind of cache
* how single-address-space virtual memory addressing interacts with cache hardware
* how per-process virtual memory addressing interacts with cache hardware

== No cache ==

Most processors today, such as the processors inside standard keyboards and mice, don't have any cache.
Many historically important computers, such as Cray supercomputers, don't have any cache.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajsmith&quot; /&gt;
The vast majority of software neither knows nor cares about the specific details of the cache, or if there is even a cache at all.

Processors without a cache are usually limited in performance by the main memory access time.
Without a cache, the processor fetches each instruction, one at a time, from main memory,
and every LOAD or STORE goes to main memory before executing the next instruction.

One way to improve performance is to substitute faster main memory.
Alas, that usually has a financial limit: hardly anyone is willing to pay a penny a bit for a gigabyte of really fast main memory.

Even if money is no object, eventually one reaches physical limits to main memory access time.
Even with the fastest possible memory money can buy, the memory access time for a unified 1 gigabyte main memory is limited
by the time it takes a signal to get from the CPU to the most distant part of the memory and back.

== Single cache ==

Using exactly the same technology, it takes less time for a signal to traverse a small block of memory than a large block of memory.

The performance of a processor with a cache is no longer limited by the main memory access time.
The performance of a processor with a cache is usually limited in performance by the (much faster) cache memory access time:
if the cache access time of a processor could be decreased, the processor would have higher performance.
&lt;ref name=&quot;ajsmith&quot; /&gt;
However, cache memory is generally much easier to speed up than main memory:
really fast memory is much more affordable when we only buy small amounts of it.
If it will improve the performance of a system significantly, lots of people are willing to pay a penny a bit for a kilobyte of really fast cache memory.

=== Principal of Locality ===

There are two types of locality, '''spatial''' and '''temporal'''. Modern computer programs are typically loop-based, and therefore we have two rules about locality:

;Spatial Locality:When a data item is accessed, it is likely that data items in sequential memory locations will also be accessed. Consider the traversal of an array, or the act of storing local variables on a stack. In these cases, when one data item is accessed, it is a good idea to load the surrounding memory area into the cache at the same time.
;Temporal Locality:When data item is accessed, it is likely that the same data item will be accessed again. For instance, variables are typically read and written to in rapid succession. If is a good idea to keep recently used items in the cache, and not over-write data that has been recently used.

== Hit or Miss ==

A '''hit''' when talking about cache is when the processor finds data in the cache that it is looking for. A '''miss''' is when the processor looks for data in the cache, but the data is not available. In the event of a miss, the cache controller unit must gather the data from the main memory, which can cost more time for the processor.

Measurements of &quot;the hit ratio&quot; are typically performed on [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] applications.
The actual hit ratio varies widely from one application to another. In particular, video and audio streaming applications often have a hit ratio close to zero, because each bit of data in the stream is read once for the first time (a compulsory miss), used, and then never read or written again.
Even worse, many cache algorithms (in particular, LRU) allow this streaming data fill the cache, pushing out of the cache information that will be used again soon (cache pollution).&lt;ref&gt;
Paul V. Bolotoff.
[http://alasir.com/articles/cache_principles/ &quot;Functional Principles of Cache Memory&quot;].
2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cache performance ==

A processor with a cache first looks in the cache for data (or instructions). On a miss, the processor then fetches the data (or instructions) from main memory.
On a miss, this process takes *longer* than an equivalent processor without a cache.

There are three ways a cache gives better net performance than a processor without a cache:

* A hit (read from the cache) is faster than the time it takes a processor without a cache to fetch from main memory. The trick is to design the cache so we get hits often enough that their increase in performance more than makes up for the loss in performance on the occasional miss. (This requires a cache that is faster than main memory).
* Multiprocessor computers with a shared main memory often have a bottleneck accessing main memory. When a local cache succeeds in satisfying memory operations without going all the way to main memory, main memory bandwidth is freed up for the other processors, and the local processor doesn't need to wait for the other processors to finish their memory operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajsmith&quot; /&gt;
* Many systems are designed so the processor often read multiple items from cache simultaneously -- either 3 separate caches for instruction, data, and TLB; or a multiported cache; or both -- which takes less time than reading the same items from main memory one at a time.

The last two ways improve overall performance even if the cache is no faster than main memory.

A processor without a cache has a constant memory reference time T of
:&lt;math&gt;T = Tm + E&lt;/math&gt;

A processor with a cache has an average memory access time of&lt;ref name=&quot;ajsmith&quot; /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = m*Tm + Th + E&lt;/math&gt;

where
* m is the miss ratio
* Tm is the time to make a main memory reference
* Th is the time to make a cache reference on a hit
* E accounts for various secondary factors (memory refresh time, multiprocessor contention, etc.)

=== Flushing the Cache ===

When the processor needs data, it looks in the cache. If the data is not in the cache, it will then go to memory to find the data. Data from memory is moved to the cache and then used by the processor. Sometimes the entire cache contains useless or old data, and it needs to be '''flushed'''. Flushing occurs when the cache controller determines that the cache contains more potential misses than hits. Flushing the cache takes several processor cycles, so much research has gone into developing algorithms to keep the cache up to date. 

== Cache Hierarchy ==

Cache is typically divided between multiple levels. The most common levels are L1, L2, and L3. L1 is the smallest but the fastest. L3 is the largest but the slowest. Many chips do not have L3 cache. Some chips that do have an L3 cache actually have an external L3 module that exists on the motherboard between the microprocessor and the RAM.

=== Inclusive, exclusive, and other cache hierarchy ===

When there are several levels of cache, and a copy of the data in some location in main memory has been cached in the L1 cache, is there another copy of that data in the L2 cache?

* No. Some systems are designed to have strictly exclusive cache levels: any particular location in main memory is cached in at most one cache level.

* Yes. Other systems are designed to have a strictly inclusive cache levels: whenever some location in main memory is cached in any one level, the same location is also cached in all higher levels. All the data in the L2 cache can also be found in L3 (and also in main memory).
All the data in a L1 cache can also be found in L2 and L3 (and also in main memory).

* Maybe. In some systems, such as the Intel Pentium 4, some data in the L1 cache is also in the L2 cache, while other data in the L1 cache is not in the L2 cache. This kind of cache policy does not yet have a popular name.

== Size of Cache ==

[[Image:Intel-pentium-pro-CPU.jpg|thumb|right|The Pentium Pro chip was one of the largest microprocessors ever manufactured. It was so large because it contained the largest cache of any chip at the time.]]

There are a number of factors that affect the size of cache on a chip:

#Moore's law provides an increasing number of transistors per chip. After around 1989, more transistors are available per chip than a designer can use to make a CPU. These extra transistors are easily converted to large caches.
#Processor components become smaller as transistors become smaller. This means there is more area on the die for additional cache.
#More cache means fewer delays in accessing data, and therefore better performance.

Because of these factors, chip caches tend to get larger and larger with each generation of chip.

{{-}}

== Cache Tagging ==

Cache can contain non-sequential data items in no particular order. A block of memory in the cache might be empty and contain no data at all. In order for hardware to check the validity of entries in the cache, every cache entry needs to maintain the following pieces of information:
#A status bit to determine if the block is empty or full
#The memory address of the data in the block
#The data from the specified memory address (a &quot;block in the cache&quot;, also called a &quot;line in the cache&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajsmith&quot; /&gt;)

When the processor looks for data in the cache, it sends a memory address to the cache controller. the cache controller checks the address against all the address fields in the cache. If there is a hit, the cache controller returns the data. If there is a miss, the cache controller must pass the request to the next level of cache or to the main memory unit.

The cache controller splits an effective memory address ([[Most significant bit|MSB]] to [[Least significant bit|LSB]]) into the tag, the index, and the block offset.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Cache,basic.svg|center|600px|A diagram of cache showing non-sequential data]]

The memory address of the data in the cache is known as the '''tag'''.

== Memory Stall Cycles ==

If the cache misses, the processor will need to stall the current instruction until the cache can fetch the correct data from a higher level. The amount of time lost by the stall is dependent on a number of factors. The number of memory accesses in a particular program is denoted as ''A&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''; some of those accesses will hit the cache, and the rest will miss the cache. The rate of misses, equal to the probability that any particular access will miss, is denoted ''r&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''. The average amount of time lost for each miss is known as the miss penalty, and is denoted as ''P&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''. We can calculate the amount of time wasted because of cache miss stalls as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{stall time} = A_m \times r_m \times P_m&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, if we have the total number of instructions in a program, ''N'', and the average number of misses per instruction, ''MPI'', we can calculate the lost time as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{stall time} = N \times MPI \times P_m&lt;/math&gt;

If instead of lost time we measure the miss penalty in the amount of lost cycles, the calculation will instead produce the number of cycles lost to memory stalls, instead of the amount of time lost to memory stalls.

=== Read Stall Times ===

To calculate the amount of time lost to cache read misses, we can perform the same basic calculations as above:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{read-stall time} = A_r \times r_r \times P_r&lt;/math&gt;

''A&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the average number of read accesses, ''r&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the miss rate on reads, and ''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the time or cycle penalty associated with a read miss.

=== Write Stall Times ===

Determining the amount of time lost to write stalls is similar, but an additional additive term that represents stalls in the write buffer needs to be included:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{write-stall time} = A_w \times r_w \times P_w + T_{wb}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''T&lt;sub&gt;wb&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the amount of time lost because of stalls in the write buffer. The write buffer can stall when the cache attempts to synchronize with main memory.

{{TODO|Why would the cache ever attempt to synchronize with main memory? What causes such a synchronization to start?|DavidCary|Microprocessor Design}}

=== Hierarchy Stall Times ===

In a hierarchical cache system, miss time penalties can be compounded when data is missed in multiple levels of cache. If data is missed in the L1 cache, it will be looked for in the L2 cache. However, if it also misses in the L2 cache, there will be a double-penalty. The L2 needs to load the data from the main memory (or the L3 cache, if the system has one), and then the data needs to be loaded into the L1. Notice that missing in two cache levels and then having to access main memory takes longer than if we had just accessed memory directly.

=== Design Considerations ===

L1 cache is typically designed with the intent of minimizing the time it takes to make a hit. If hit times are sufficiently fast, a sizable miss rate can be accepted. Misses in the L1 will be redirected to the L2 and that is still significantly faster than accesses to main memory. L1 cache tends to have smaller block sizes, but benefits from having more available blocks for the same amount of space. In order to make L1 hit times minimal, L1 are typically direct-mapped or even narrowly 2-way set associative. 

L2 cache, on the other hand, needs to have a lower miss rate to help avoid accesses to main memory. Accesses to L2 cache are much faster than accesses to memory, so we should do everything possible to ensure that we maximize our hit rate. For this reason, L2 cache tends to be fully associative with large block sizes. This is because memory is typically read and written in sequential memory cells, so large block sizes can take advantage of that sequentiality. 

L3 cache further continues this trend, with larger block sizes, and minimized miss rate.

==== block size ====

A very small cache block size increases the miss ratio, since a miss will fetch less data at a time.
A very large cache block size also increases the miss ratio, since it causes the system to fetch a bunch of extra information that is used less than the data it displaces in the cache.
&lt;ref name=&quot;ajsmith&quot; /&gt;


== Associativity ==

In order to increase the read speed in a cache, many cache designers implement some level of '''associativity'''. An associative cache creates a relationship between the original memory location and the location in the cache where that data is stored. The relationship between the address in main memory and the location where the data is stored is known as the '''mapping''' of the cache. In this way, if the data exists in the cache at all, the cache controller knows that it can only be in certain locations that satisfy the mapping.

=== Direct-Mapped ===

A direct-mapped system uses a hashing algorithm to assign an identifier to a memory address. A common hashing algorithm for this purpose is the modulo operation. The modulo operation divides the address by a certain number, ''p'', and takes the remainder ''r'' as the result. If ''a'' is the main memory address, and ''n'' is an arbitrary non-negative integer, then the hashing algorithm must satisfy the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;a = p \times n + r&lt;/math&gt;

If ''p'' is chosen properly by the designer, data will be evenly distributed throughout the cache.

[[Image:Cache Block Basic.svg|center|400px]]

In a direct-mapped system, each memory address corresponds to only a single cache location, but a single cache location can correspond to many memory locations. The image above shows a simple cache diagram with 8 blocks. All memory addresses therefore are calculated as ''n mod 8'', where ''n'' is the memory address to read into the cache. Memory addresses 0, 8, and 16 will all map to block 0 in the cache. Cache performance is worst when multiple data items with the same hash value are read, and performance is best when data items are close together in memory (such as a sequential block of program instructions, or a sequential array).

Most external caches (located on the motherboard, but external to the CPU)
are direct-mapped or occasionally 2-way set associative,
because it's complicated to build higher-associativity caches out of standard components.&lt;ref name=&quot;bolotoff&quot; /&gt;
If there is such a cache, typically there is only one external cache on the motherboard, shared between all CPUs.

The replacement policy for a direct-mapped cache is the simplest possible replacement policy:
the new data must go in the one and only one place in the cache it corresponds to.
(The old data at the location in the cache, if its dirty bit is set, must be written to main memory first).

=== 2-Way Set Associative ===

In a 2-way set associative cache system, the data value is hashed, but each hash value corresponds to a set of cache blocks. Each block contains multiple data cells, and a data value that is assigned to that block can be inserted anywhere in the block. The read speeds are quick because the cache controller can immediately narrow down its search area to the block that matches the address hash value.

The LRU replacement policy for a 2-way set associative cache is one of the simplest replacement policies:
The new data must go in one of a set of 2 possible locations.
Those 2 locations share a LRU bit that is updated whenever either one is read or written, indicating which one of the two entries in the set was the most-recently used.
The new data goes in the *other* location (the least-recently used location).
(The old data at that LRU location in the cache, if its dirty bit is set, must be written to main memory first).

=== 2 way skewed associative ===

The 2-way skewed associative cache is &quot;the best tradeoff for .... caches whose sizes are in the range 4K-8K bytes&quot; -- André Seznec{{cite web |url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/seznec93case.html |title=A Case for Two-Way Skewed-Associative Caches |accessdate=2007-12-13 |author=André Seznec}}&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.irisa.fr/caps/PROJECTS/Architecture/ Micro-Architecture] &quot;Skewed-associative caches have ... major advantages over conventional set-associative caches.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fully Associative ===

In a fully-associative cache, hash algorithms are not employed and data can be inserted anywhere in the cache that is available. A typical algorithm will write a new data value over the oldest unused data value in the cache. This scheme, however, requires the time an item is loaded or accessed to be stored, which can require lots of additional storage.

== Cache Misses ==

There are three basic types of misses in a cache:
#Conflict Misses
#Compulsory Misses
#Capacity Misses

=== Conflict Misses ===

[[Image:Cache Block Basic Conflict.svg|center|400px]]

A conflict miss occurs in a direct-mapped and 2-way set associative cache when two data items are mapped to the same cache locations. In a data miss, a recently used data item is overwritten with a new data item.

=== Compulsory Misses ===

[[Image:Cache Block Conflict Compulsary.svg]]

The image above shows the difference between a conflict miss and a compulsory miss. A compulsory miss is an instance where the cache must miss because it does not contain any data. For instance, when a processor is first powered-on, there is no valid data in the cache and the first few reads will always miss.

The compulsory miss demonstrates the need for a cache to differentiate between a space that is empty and one that is full. Consider when we turn the processor on, and we reset all the address values to zero, an attempt to read a memory location with a hash value of zero will hit. We do not want the cache to hit if the blocks are empty.

=== Capacity Misses ===

Capacity misses occur when the cache block is not large enough to hold the data item.

== Cache Write Policy ==

Data writes require the same time delay as a data read. For this reason, caching systems typically will write data to the cache as well. However, when writing to the cache, it is important to ensure that the data is also written to the main memory, so it is not overwritten by the next cache read. If data in the cache is overwritten without being stored in main memory, the data will be lost.

It is imperative that caches write data to the main memory, but exactly when that data is written to the main memory is called the '''write policy'''. There are two write policies: '''write through''' and '''write back'''.


Write operations take as long to perform as read operations in main memory. Many cached processors therefore will perform write operations on the cache as well as read operations.

=== Write Through ===

When data is written to memory, a write request is sent simultaneously to the main memory and to the cache. This way, the result data is available in the cache before it can be written (and then read again) from the main memory. When writing to the cache, it's important to make sure the main memory and the cache are synchronized and they contain the same data.

In a write through system, data that is written to the cache is immediately written to the main memory as well. If many writes need to occur is sequential instructions, the write buffer may get backed up and cause a stall.

=== Write Back ===

In a write back system, the cache controller keeps track of which data items have been synchronized to main memory. The data items which have not been synchronized are called &quot;dirty&quot;, and the cache controller prevents dirty data from being overwritten.

The cache controller will synchronize data during processor cycles where no other data is being written to the cache.

=== Write bypass ===

Some processors send writes directly to main memory, bypassing the cache.
If that location is *not* already cached, then nothing more needs to be done.
If that location *is* already cached, then the old data in the cache(s) needs to be marked &quot;invalid&quot; (&quot;stale&quot;) so if the CPU ever reads that location, the CPU will read the latest value from main memory rather than some earlier value(s) in the cache(s).

== Stale Data ==

It is possible for the data in main memory to be changed by a component besides the microcontroller. For instance, many computer systems have memory-mapped I/O, or a DMA controller that can alter the data. Some computer systems have several CPUs connected to a common main memory. It is important that the cache controller check that data in the cache is correct. Data in the cache that is old and may be incorrect is called &quot;stale&quot;.

The three most popular{{fact}} approaches to dealing with stale data (&quot;cache coherency protocols&quot;) are:
* Use simple cache hardware that ignores what the other CPUs are doing.
* Set all caches to write-through all STOREs (write-through policy). Use additional cache hardware to listen in (&quot;snoop&quot;) whenever some other device writes to main memory, and invalidate local cache line whenever some other device writes to the corresponding cached location in main memory.
{{Wikipedia|MESI protocol}}
* Design caches to use the MESI protocol.

{{TODO|Fill in more details on MESI and alternative cache coherency protocols|DavidCary|Microprocessor Design}}

With simple cache hardware that ignores what the other CPUs are doing, cache coherency is maintained by the OS software. The OS sets up each page in memory as either (a) exclusive to one particular CPU (which is allowed to read, write, and cache it); all other CPUs are not allowed to read or write or cache that page; (b) shared read/write between CPUs, and set to &quot;non-cacheable&quot;, in the same way that memory-mapped I/O devices are set to non-cacheable; or (c) shared read-only; all CPUs are allowed to cache but not write that page.

== Split cache ==

High-performance processors invariably have 2 separate L1 caches, the instruction cache and the data cache (I-cache and D-cache).
This &quot;split cache&quot; has several advantages over a unified cache:&lt;ref name=&quot;bolotoff&quot; &gt;
Paul V. Bolotoff.
[http://alasir.com/articles/cache_principles/cache_hierarchy.html &quot;Functional Principles of Cache Memory&quot;].
2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wiring simplicity: the decoder and scheduler are only hooked to the I-cache; the registers and ALU and FPU are only hooked to the D-cache.
* Speed: the CPU can be reading data from the D-cache, while simultaneously loading the next instruction(s) from the I-cache.

Multi-CPU systems typically have a separate L1 I-cache and L1 D-cache for each CPU, each one direct-mapped for speed.

''Open question: To speed up running Java applications in a JVM (and similar interpreters and CPU emulators), would it help to have 3 separate caches -- a machine instruction cache indexed by the program counter PC, a byte code cache indexed by the VM's instruction pointer IP, and a data cache ?''

On the other hand, in a high-performance processor, other levels of cache, if any -- L2, L3, etc. -- as well as main memory -- are typically unified, although there are several exceptions (such as the Itanium 2 Montecito).
The advantages of a unified cache (and a unified main memory) are:&lt;ref name=&quot;bolotoff&quot; /&gt;
* Some programs spend most of their time in a small part of the program processing lots of data. Other programs run lots of different subroutines against a small amount of data. A unified cache automatically balances the proportion of the cache used for instructions and the proportion used for data -- to get the same performance on a split cache would require a larger cache.
* when instructions are written to memory -- by an OS loading an executable file from storage, or from a just-in-time compiler translating bytecode to executable code -- a split cache requires the CPU to flush and reload the instruction cache; a unified cache doesn't require that.

== Error detection ==

Each cache row entry may have error detection bits.
Since the cache only holds a copy of information in the main memory
(except for the write-back queue),
when an error is detected, the desired data can be re-fetched from the main memory -- treated as a kind of miss-on-invalid -- and the system can continue as if no error occurred.
A few computer systems use Hamming error correction to correct single-bit errors in the &quot;data&quot; field of the cache without going all the way back to main memory.&lt;ref&gt;
Paul V. Bolotoff.
[http://alasir.com/articles/cache_principles/cache_line_tag_index.html Functional Principles of Cache Memory].
2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specialized cache features ==

Many CPUs use exactly the same hardware for the instruction cache and the data cache.
(And, of course, the same hardware is used for instructions as for data in a unified cache. The revolutionary idea of a Von Neumann architecture is to use the same hardware for instructions and for data in the main memory itself).
For example, the Fairchild CLIPPER used 2 identical CAMMU chips, one for the instruction cache and one for the data cache.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajsmith&quot; &gt;
Alan Jay Smith.
&quot;Design of CPU Cache Memories&quot;.
Proc. IEEE TENCON, 1987.
[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1987/5288.html]
[http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1987/CSD-87-357.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the various caches are used slightly differently,
some CPU designers customize each cache in different ways.

* Some CPU designers put the &quot;branch history bits&quot; used for [[Microprocessor Design/Hazards#Branch Prediction | branch prediction]] in the instruction cache. There's no point to adding such information to a data-only cache.
* Many instruction caches are designed in such a way that the only way to deal with stale instructions is to invalidate the entire cache and reload. Data caches are typically designed with more fine-grained response, with extra hardware that can invalidate and reload only the particular cache lines that have gone stale.
* The virtual-to-physical address translation process often has a lot of specialized hardware associated with it to make it go faster -- the TLB cache, hardware page-walkers, etc. We will discuss this in more detail in the next chapter, [[../Virtual Memory/]].

**Toxicity: well tolerated; [[w:Moyamoya_disease|Moyamoya disease]] in one child with NF1; 6 patients with optic pathway tumors maintained/improved their vision
**Conclusion: Proton RT is safe and efficacious; longer term follow-up needed


==Adult Pilocytic Astrocytoma==
*Uncommon
*Clinical presentation includes visual disturbances, seizures, and headaches. Papilledema common
*Favorable prognosis both in terms of survival and neurologic function
*Most remain stable after resection (gross or subtotal) only, and need no adjuvant RT with close follow-up
*It may be reasonable to offer RT in unresectable disease, especially if causing neurologic symptoms
*10 year OS 95%


*'''Intergroup NCCTG/RTOG''' (1986-1994)
**Prospective. 20 adults with supratentorial pilocytic astrocytoma. If gross total (n=11) or subtotal (n=6) resection, observation. If biopsy only (n=3), RT 50.4 Gy to 2-cm edema margin 
**'''10 years; 2004''' PMID 15001258 -- &quot;Adult patients with supratentorial pilocytic astrocytomas: a prospective multicenter clinical trial.&quot; (Brown PD, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 Mar 15;58(4):1153-60.) Median F/U 10 years
***10-year outcome: 95% alive. 1 patient died of unknown cause 2.1 years after enrollment; 1 patient progressed 1 month after enrollment and was salvaged with P-32 followed 1.5 years later by RT, now without evidence of progression at 9 years
***Conclusion: Favorable prognosis; don't need RT after gross total or subtotal resection</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Radiation Oncology/Thyroid:TOC}}

==Epidemiology==
*2% of thyroid cancers
*13-39% thyroid cancer deaths
*F&gt;M 3:1
*Mean age of diagnosis is 65

==Pathophysiology==
*Thought to be a de-differentiation of a previously differentiated thyroid cancer.
*20% have history of differentiated thyroid CA
*20-30% have concurrent papillary thyroid CA
*loss of p53 thought to be a major step in de-differentiation.

==Histologic Subtypes==
''Histologic subtype has not been found to affect prognosis.''
*Spindle Cell
*Giant Cell
*Squamoid

==Staging==
''All anaplastic thyroid CA is considered stage IV.''
:''see [[Radiation Oncology/Thyroid/Staging|Staging]] for details.''

==Treatment==
*Monotherapy (surgery, chemo, xrt) have not shown to benefit overall survival.
*Current treatment of choice is multi-modality.  Upfront resection is preferred if tumor confined to thyroid.
*Hyperfractionated xrt with adriamycin treatment of choice for locally advanced non-metastatic.  Consider consolidative surgery if good response to chemoxrt.
*Dose of 60 Gy in 40 fx over 4 wks.

===Treatment Prognostic Factors===
*'''SEER Database Analysis, 2005''' PMID 15739211 &quot;Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Treatment outcome and prognostic factors,&quot; (Kebebew E, Cancer. 2005; 103(7):1330-5.)
**516 pts from SEER cancer registry tx'd for anaplastic thyroid CA from 1973-2000.  
**Overall cause-specific mortality at 6 mo's was 68.4% and at 12 mo's was 80.7%.
**On multi-variate analysis age&lt;60 and intrathyroid tumor (w/o mets) were independent predictors of lower cause-specific mortality.
**Conclusion:  given the majority of data for ATC derived from small single institution series which are subject to selection bias, this analysis identifies prognostic factors that may be used to triage more aggressive treatments to patients who may benefit.

===Combined Modality Approach===
*'''SEER Database Analysis, 2008''' (1983-2002) PMID 18838882 &amp;mdash; &quot;Surgery and radiotherapy improves survival in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: analysis of the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results 1983-2002.&quot; (Chen J, Am J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct;31(5):460-4.)
**261 pts who had surgery performed or recommended
**Median survival 4 months. On multivariate analysis, distant disease, tumor size &gt; 7 cm, and treatment with surgery (+/- RT) were significant related to survival. The addition of RT to surgery resulted in improved survival for pts with disease extending into adjacent tissue but not for those with disease limited to the capsule or with distant metastatic disease
**Conclusion: surgery and radiotherapy improves survival.

*'''Princess Margaret, 2001''' PMID 11413523 &quot;Completely resected anaplastic thyroid carcinoma combined with adjuvant chemotherapy and irradiation is associated with prolonged survival,&quot; (Haigh PI, Cancer. 2001; 91(12):2335-42.)
**33 pts w/ anaplastic thyroid cancer retrospectively reviewed to determine prognostic factors.  64% w/ metastatic dz.  92% received adjuvant therapy.
**Pts w/ curative resection w/ longer median survival.
**Conclusion:  Complete resection or maximum tumor debulking followed by adjuvant chemo/xrt resulted in some long term survivals.

*'''Mayo Clinic, 2001''' PMID 11742333 &quot;Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: a 50-year experience at a single institution,&quot; (McIver B, Surgery. 2001; 130(6):1028-34.)
**134 cases b/w 1949-99, mean age 67, 46% w/ mets at time of dx
**72% underwent surgery, 30% w/ complete resection
**Neither surgery, chemo, nor radiation improved survival significantly.  Combined modality approach was the only approach that led to long-term survivors.

===Altered Fractionation of Radiotherapy===
*'''Princess Margaret, 2006''' PMID 16967442 &quot;Clinical outcome of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma treated with radiotherapy of once- and twice-daily fractionation regimens,&quot;  (Wang Y, Cancer. 2006; 107(8):1786-92)
**47 pts w/ anaplastic thyroid CA tx'd b/w 1983-2004.  Pts tx'd palliatively or w/ curative intent w/ goal to assess local control, survival, toxicity of once vs twice daily regimens.
**94% 6 mo local PFS if xrt w/ radical intent, 64% if palliative intent.  Median OS 3.3 mo's longer if BID fractionation (13.6 vs 10.3 mo's)
**Conclusion:  twice daily fractionation appears to lead to better outcome.

*'''Royal Marsden Pure Accelerated XRT, 1999''' PMID 10225555 &quot;Phase II evaluation of high dose accelerated radiotherapy for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma,&quot; (Mitchell G, Radiother Oncol. 1999; 50(1):33-8.)
**17 pts w/ anaplastic thyroid CA tx'd w/ BID xrt to 60.8 Gy (1.8 Gy in AM, 2 Gy in PM)
**3 pts w/ CR, 7 pts w/ partial response; toxicity from esophagitis/dysphagia high (40% grade 4 pharyngo-esophagitis, dysphagia)
**Conclusions of the authors were that toxicities of pure acceleration were unacceptably high in spite of improved local control rate.

*'''Sweden, 1994''' PMID 8055459 &quot;Combined doxorubicin, hyperfractionated radiotherapy, and surgery in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Report on two protocols. The Swedish Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Group,&quot;  (Tennvall J, Cancer. 1994; 74(4):1348-54. )
**33 pts w/ anaplastic thyroid CA tx'd w/ hyperfractionated xrt (30 Gy preop, 46 Gy postop), doxorubicin, surgery

==Protein-Protein Interaction Network Visualization==
&lt;!--Poulami--&gt;

[[Image:Human_interactome.jpg|thumb|Human interactome]]
Protein interaction network visualization is one of the most user-friendly features developed for the simulation process of protein protein interactions. Drawing of a protein may seem to be easy but generating the same protein with all the types of conformation that it can attain for a simulation process is quite difficult. In this context one of the greatest manually produced molecular structures of its time was done by Kurt Kohn's 1999 map of cell cycle control.{{ref|1}}  In this paper around 1,548 proteins were linked together as determined by yeast two-hybrid assay.
&lt;!--Sarah--&gt;
Protein-protein interaction network visualization deals with territory that is very similar to that of [[Proteomics/Protein - Protein Interactions/Prediction| protein-protein interaction prediction]], but differs in several key ways.  Foremost, visualization tools were developed simply for illustrating the big picture represented by protein-protein interaction data or expression data, for qualitative assessment, not necessarily for quantitative analysis or prediction.  Expression and interaction experiments tend to be on such a large scale that it is difficult to analyze them, or indeed grasp the meaning of the results of any analysis.  Visual representation of such large and scattered quantities of data allows trends that are difficult to pinpoint numerically to stand out and provide insight into specific avenues of protein functions and interactions that may be worth exploring first out of the bunch, either through confirmation or rejection and then later of significance or insignificance to the research problem at hand.  With a few recent exceptions, visualization tools were not designed with the intent of being used for analysis so much as to show the workings of a molecular system more clearly.

Visualization tools also do not actually predict protein-protein interactions themselves or their characteristics.  On the contrary, visualization tools only create a graphical representation of what is already &quot;known&quot; in literature and in molecular interaction repositories such as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_ontology Gene Ontology](GO).{{ref|2}}  A side-effect of displaying interaction networks by treating some proteins as members of more general family groupings or going by interactions in different tissues or as analogues in other tissues or organisms is the apparent display of a protein-protein or other molecular interaction that is inferred but may or may not have actually been observed and documented, something that could be misconstrued as a predicted interaction.  There is no statistical analysis involved; this phenomenon is merely a fluke of the annotation scheme used as a reference (albeit a useful fluke).

Perhaps the most significant difference between protein-protein interaction network visualization and [[Proteomics/Protein - Protein Interactions/Prediction| protein-protein interaction prediction]] is the nature of the information it provides.  Protein-protein interaction prediction is characterized by its concern with how proteins will interact, where they will interact, under what conditions they were interact, and what parts are necessary for their interaction.  These characteristics are governed by physical and chemical properties of the proteins or other molecules involved, which may be actual molecules that have been described through extensive proteomics experiments or hypothetical, ''in silico'' generated species that are being investigated for [[Proteomics/Proteomics and Drug Discovery/Structure-Based Drug Design| pharmaceutical]] and other applications.  Interaction network visualization tools are given no knowledge of physical or chemical properties of the proteins they are displaying other than their presence in the system and sometimes a normalized level of expression.  As a result, the information they inadvertently impart concerns only whether or not certain proteins putatively interact with certain other proteins, not how they interact, when they interact, or why they interact.

==Visualization Tools==
Due to the ever increasing employment of interaction of network visualization to direct research, scientists decided to automate the process. Some of the automated visualization systems are as follows. 
===Osprey===
Osprey is a visualization tool that represents genes as nodes and interactions between gene products as edges.  It uses the GRID database to determine interactions by default, but can be configured in a number of ways to meet the user's needs.  Osprey was developed in answer to the need to text-search the network of interactions and can output networks to a number of graphical formats.{{ref|3}}

A limited version is available at the BioGRID website: http://www.thebiogrid.org/

A full version for personal or non-profit use is downloadable from the Osprey site: http://biodata.mshri.on.ca/osprey/servlet/Index

===VisANT===
VisANT is a tool that creates a visual interface for mining gene/protein interaction data with a focus on being adaptable to new types of data, both in terms of interactions and interacting members.  It taps into a number of databases including [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genbank GenBank], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KEGG KEGG], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swissprot SwissProt].{{ref|4}}

VisANT is available via web interface at the VisANT site: http://visant.bu.edu/

===NAViGaTOR===
NAViGaTOR is an interaction visualization tool that combines Java with OpenGL to deliver multi-platform 2D and 3D representations of physical protein-protein interaction networks.  It includes options for color-coding network maps according to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_ontology GO] and information in the literature.  NAViGaTOR supports standard import and export formats such as GO and [http://psidev.sourceforge.net/ Proteomics Standards Initiative] (PSI).{{ref|5}}

NAViGaTOR is available for download online at the NAViGaTOR site: http://ophid.utoronto.ca/navigator

===Cytoscape===
Cytoscape is primarily a visualization tool written in Java for molecular interaction networks.  User-defined interactions are supported, as is the ability to record attributes of nodes, edges, and networks.  Annotations can be imported from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_ontology GO] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KEGG KEGG].  Cytoscape allows visualization of expression data on a network not just by user-defined color-coding, but also through border thickness and color and the option to display expression levels and p-values on the network.  Methods for analysis can be added through plugins that allow filtering by expression level, identifying differentially expressed subnetworks, and identifying clusters of highly interconnected nodes (molecules).{{ref|6}}

===yEd===
yEd is a graph editor that allows users to edit existing graphs as well as generate new ones but is not limited to working with biological data and offers no analysis tools.  It seems as though yEd might be of use chiefly as a tool for cleaning up and tweaking graphs generated by other, more biologically-specialized visualization tools to be used for posters or other publications.  yEd does support widely-used import formats like GML and is available for a number of platforms.{{ref|7}}

===NetPro===
NetPro is a commercially developed and manually-curated protein-protein interactions database.  The emphasis in NetPro is on facilitating the literature search and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_text_mining text-mining] steps of investigating putative protein-protein interactions and their ramifications.{{ref|8}}  Molecular Connections, the company that maintains and distributes NetPro, is also the producer of a handful of other visualization tools.{{ref|9}}

NetPro is not free, but more information is provided at the Molecular Connections site: http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/databases/transpath/6.0/doc/netpro.html

'''Okame cherry''' is a hybrid tree, which is one of the earliest cherries to bloom, and thus is often planted in parks and gardens. The name &quot;Okame&quot; is Japanese, referring to a woman who is often depicted in statues. 

==Description==
More or less vase-shaped crown, densely covered in pink flowers before the leaves emerge in the spring.

==Growing conditions==
Full sun to medium shade, often does fine under high canopies. The plant prefers deep, fertile soils. Somethat drought tolerant after established.

==Uses==
As a specimen or patio shade tree. Forces well, so can also be grown for cut flowers.

==Maintenance==
[[Image:Daihouonji_Okame.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A statue of Okame in Japan]]
Pruning for crossing branches should be done every 2-4 years. The tree is often grafted, so basal suckers should be removed if present.

==Propagation==
Generally grafted.

==Harvesting==
For forcing, cut branches just as the buds begin to expand. 

==Pests and diseases==
Usually problem-free. See ''[[../Prunus/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases.

Hacker [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor Fyodor] (Gordon Lynn) wrote '''&lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;''' to assist in port scanning and network analysis.  He published the original source code in [http://www.phrack.org/archives/51/P51-11 Phrack Magazine, Volume 7, Issue 51, Article 11], and now maintains the tool at [http://insecure.org/ Insecure.org].  Security experts all over the world use &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; for simple network checks, detecting open ports and service versions; the NSA [http://images.insecure.org/nmap/images/wash-post-nsa.jpg keeps a list of security tools and current versions]&amp;mdash;including &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;, Snort, and Nessus&amp;mdash;up on the big board.

&lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; does not only detect open ports; it detects services and operating system versions as well.  You can use &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; to scan a default range of ports, or a specific subset; it can scan a single host, a range, or a set; and it can find out if hosts are up or down. &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; can become a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled user, for good or for evil.

The &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; network scanning tool supplies a diverse set of options to control its behavior. It can scan multiple hosts and host ranges; utilize various scanning techniques; identify operating systems and service versions; and even perform stealth scanning to avoid triggering certain IDS and IPS utilities.

==Basic use==
First, let's cover some basic use of &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;.  You should at the very least know how to scan hosts and check for specific ports; these fundamentals will show you what's open on the target network.

===Scanning hosts===
Basic use of &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; just involves scanning a target IP address or domain name. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
bluefox@ice-ldap:~$ nmap webserv1

Starting Nmap 4.10 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ ) at 2007-04-01 15:52 EDT
Interesting ports on webserv1 (192.168.30.11):
Not shown: 1644 closed ports, 28 filtered ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
21/tcp   open  ftp
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
111/tcp  open  rpcbind
199/tcp  open  smux
443/tcp  open  https
1008/tcp open  ufsd

Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 15.142 seconds
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this mode of operation, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; shows the open ports and the common service carried on that port. &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; will not show services moved to other ports accurately; http on port 21 will read as ftp, for example.

You can specify multiple hosts on &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;'s command line as well:

&lt;pre&gt;
bluefox@ice-ldap:~$ nmap dbserv1 webserv1

443/tcp  open  https
1008/tcp open  ufsd

Nmap finished: 2 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 17.001 seconds
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see, my Web server exposes too many ports and my MySQL server has a weak firewall; I ran this scan from a DMZ, which has to go through the firewall to enter my network.  Here we can see the power of &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;:  I know I should switch my firewall to default deny and allow only the services needed through explicitly.  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; identifies ''filtered'' ports by a lack of response; ''closed'' ports send a TCP packet with a RST flag when you try to open them, indicating the server received the packet and would have allowed you to connect to any service listening on that port.

===Advanced target specification===
&lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; allows you to use IP address targets for various sets and ranges based on a simple syntax.

* &lt;code&gt;''x-y''&lt;/code&gt; - Specify from x-y. &lt;code&gt;nmap '''192.168.0-1.1-2'''&lt;/code&gt; will scan ''192.168.0.1'', ''192.168.1.1'', ''192.168.0.2'', and ''192.168.1.2''
* &lt;code&gt;''*''&lt;/code&gt; - Replaced with &lt;code&gt;0-255&lt;/code&gt;. Your shell will probably emit a bunch of file names, so just use &lt;code&gt;0-255&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;''x,y''&lt;/code&gt; - Specify &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;nmap '''192.168.0.1,2,4'''&lt;/code&gt; will scan ''192.168.0.1'', ''192.168.0.2'', and ''192.168.0.4''. Further, &lt;code&gt;nmap '''192.168.0.1-2,4'''&lt;/code&gt; will scan the same set of hosts.
* &lt;code&gt;''/n''&lt;/code&gt; - Scan CIDR notated subnets. &lt;code&gt;nmap '''192.168.0.0/16'''&lt;/code&gt; operates as &lt;code&gt;nmap '''192.168.0-255.0-255'''&lt;/code&gt; for example.

You can combine these notations in any form you want. For example, if you wanted to scan a few subnets on ''192.168.0.0/12'', you could use &lt;code&gt;nmap '''192.168.0,16,64,96.0/4'''&lt;/code&gt;. Usually you will not want to do anything this drastic, and can stick to a single host; however, if you need it, you should know how to do it. Remember, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; maps networks, not just hosts.&lt; &quot; Vs &quot; ss1 &lt;code&gt; area title yahoo&lt;&gt;facebook&lt;&gt;ip address&lt;&gt;

===Scanning ports===
* '''Switches''':  &lt;code&gt;-p&lt;/code&gt;

Sometimes you don't need to know everything open on a host, sometimes you just want to make sure proFTPd and Apache are up and the SMTP server hasn't died, and see if SSH is listening. For these situations, you can specify ports to scan. Port specification can be manipulated in the same way as target specification, using the &lt;code&gt;''x-y''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;''x,y''&lt;/code&gt; notations.

:&lt;code&gt;~$ nmap '''-p21-22,25,80,443''' webserv1&lt;/code&gt;

Scanning specific ports lets you check specific issues several orders of magnitude faster. What version of Apache a server has (&lt;code&gt;-sV -p80&lt;/code&gt;), whether a server runs MS SQL Server or MySQL (&lt;code&gt;-sV -p1433,3306&lt;/code&gt;), if the server runs ssh, etc.

===Service Scans===
* '''Switches''': &lt;code&gt;-sV&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; has the ability to do service scans and RPC grinding; in other words, it can tell you what high level protocol, application, version, version of libssl if the service supplies an SSL connection, etc., listens on a port instead of matching the port number to the common service.  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; also uses an RPC grinder, which makes RPC connections to ports running an RPC service; typically a single ''RPC portmapper'' port tells you which ports run RPC, but if the firewall blocks that then &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; will find it itself.

Let's take a look first at a scan against the server behind me.  This server provides a profoundly good example because I've configured it to let me poke holes in my college's firewall, and thus it looks really strange.  A typical &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; scan comes out well enough:

&lt;/pre&gt;

The above shows FTP, DNS, hosts2-ns, HTTP/SSL, and Microsoft Directory Services (Active Directory).  We can take a closer look with an &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; service scan using &lt;code&gt;-sV&lt;/code&gt;.  The below output gives us something quite different.

&lt;/pre&gt;

So it seems this server really has Apache serving http on two ports; OpenSSH serving over the FTP, DNS, and HTTPS ports; and Samba providing SMB connections.  Further, we can see that the server uses SSH 2.0 protocol on OpenSSH 4.3p2 Debian 5ubuntu1, a native Ubuntu .deb rather than a custom build.  We can guess with relative accuracy that this server runs Ubuntu, even without an OS scan; either that or the administrator really doesn't have a clue what he's doing, or has managed to change banners with a rewrite proxy to fool us.

Worth note, the &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt; switch activates service scanning as well.

==Advanced Port Scans==
You can run many types of advanced port scans with &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt;.  Aside from the standard &lt;code&gt;connect()&lt;/code&gt; port scan, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; requires root access to perform these advanced scans because it needs to create raw sockets and construct raw TCP/IP packets.

===Using nmap with root===
The &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; program obtains different information with and without root access.  With root access, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; can perform advanced TCP/IP scans; operating system detection; and MAC address identification.

First let's check out a normal user utilizing &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;-A&lt;/code&gt; option.  &lt;code&gt;nmap -A&lt;/code&gt; activates operating system and service scanning, in the same way as &lt;code&gt;nmap -O -sV&lt;/code&gt;.  Operating system detection requires root access, so OS detection won't work at all.  I've performed the below scan against a Linksys WRT54G wireless router.

&lt;pre&gt;
bluefox@icebox:~$ nmap -A -p80,1 192.168.1.1

&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; simply skips the OS detection phase.  When we put &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; into operation as root, however, we see that it can also look up a lot more information.  Below, we see it discovered the MAC address and identified the vendor owning that MAC space; the operating system and details about the OS; the uptime; and the network distance.  It also gave us a device type; &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; sees a Linux OS used for desktops, wireless routers, or network storage, and thus classifies the device as either general purpose, WAP, or storage.

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; becomes much more powerful with root access; however, for security reasons you should not haphazardly give &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; the SUID permission.  You can allow users to run &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; specifically via &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;, but be aware that anything that allows a user to gain root access&amp;mdash;SUID bits, &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&amp;mdash;represents a security risk.

===Operating system detection===
* '''Switches''':  &lt;code&gt;-O&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;-O&lt;/code&gt; switch enables &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; operating system detection.  OS detection attempts to use characteristics of the target's TCP/IP stack to fingerprint the remote operating system; usually it can identify Linux, Windows, and BSD, and find a general range of versions and families like Windows NT/XP or 95/98/ME.  A typical OS Detection scan looks like the below.

&lt;pre&gt;
bluefox@ice-ldap:~$ sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.105 -P0

&lt;/pre&gt;

=== TCP connect() Scan ===
* '''Switches''':  &lt;code&gt;-sT&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; allows a ''TCP connect() scan'' in all cases, administrative access or not; when you specify other scan types without root access, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; automatically substitutes this scan type.

In this scanning mode, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; opens a connection to the port in the same way a Web browser or FTP client does and checks to see how the TCP/IP stack responds.  The following results arise from this scan:

* '''open''':  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; was able to complete a connection, and then closed the port.
* '''closed''':  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; tried to connect and got an error informing it that the port was closed (the OS got a RST packet).
* '''filtered''':  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; tried to connect and the OS gave it some other error, like host or port unreachable or connection time-out.

TCP connect() scans work with all privilege levels, but can execute slowly and produce excess packets.  They also usually create more logs on the target, and can crash really poorly programmed services.

=== TCP SYN Scan ===
* '''Switches''':  &lt;code&gt;-sS&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; ''TCP SYN scan'' uses a simple SYN packet to connect to a port to determine its status.  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; uses this by default whenever it has raw socket privileges.

The TCP SYN scan sends a SYN packet as if opening a connection, and checks the result.  The following statuses come from this test:

* '''open''':  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; got a SYN/ACK from the host on that port.  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; does not have to take further action; the OS has no record of the connection, and responds to the SYN/ACK with a RST, tearing down the connection on the target.
* '''closed''':  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; got a RST from the host on that port.
* '''filtered''':  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; got something else, or nothing.

TCP SYN scans execute very quickly, create fewer logs, and act in a more stealthy manner.

== Scanning Firewalls ==
You can use &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; to penetrate firewalls as well.  &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; can perform scans useful for determining whether a firewall uses stateful filtering or not; and which ports a firewall allows through.  You can scan targets behind the firewall with this and discover the firewall rules, allowing more targeted scans and possibly evading firewall logging.

=== TCP ACK Scan ===
* '''Switches''':  &lt;code&gt;-sA&lt;/code&gt;

== Stealth Scans ==
Unfortunately, if you scan through certain IPS or IDS machines, you get loads of fluff from proxy ports. This presents a minor annoyance. I had to trim below output, as it contained thousands of lines of text.  I've obscured the host I scanned below; I had chosen a live machine on the Internet to scan for this, because I don't have the IPS hardware they use.

Fortunately, you can perform a stealth scan to evade this; unfortunately, stealth scans take an order of magnitude longer. Usually a ''polite'' scan will do the trick, it causes only 150 packets/minute.

:&lt;code&gt;~$ nmap -T polite %%%&lt;/code&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;-T&lt;/code&gt; option takes one of five arguments, given by name or number. These are:

* &lt;code&gt;'''paranoid'''&lt;/code&gt; (0) - No parallel scanning. 5 minutes between sending packets.
* &lt;code&gt;'''sneaky'''&lt;/code&gt; (1) - No parallel scanning. 15 seconds between sending packets.
* &lt;code&gt;'''polite'''&lt;/code&gt; (2) - No parallel scanning. 0.4 seconds between sending packets.
* &lt;code&gt;'''normal'''&lt;/code&gt; (3) - Default scanning. Tries to be very fast without overloading the network.
* &lt;code&gt;'''aggressive'''&lt;/code&gt; (4) - Faster than ''normal'', but loads the network.
* &lt;code&gt;'''insane'''&lt;/code&gt; (5) - Parallel scans, times out hosts in 15 minutes, won't wait more than 0.3 seconds for an individual probe. Loses a lot of information.

&lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; also provides options to control scan time-outs. Combining these with the above provides more fine-tuned scans, for example a scan doing 100 packets per minute:

:&lt;code&gt;~$ nmap -T sneaky --scan_delay 600&lt;/code&gt;

Let's try the above scan again, politely.

&lt;pre&gt;
bluefox@icebox:~$ nmap -T polite

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, thanks for your message about the Persian language wikibook :) 

Unfortunately my level of written Persian is poor and also I found when editing the font is very tiny so I didn't notice what I typed was wrong, so thank you for your help in pointing out the mistakes. In answer to your question &quot;furniture&quot; is pronounced &quot;asas&quot;. &quot;Chera&quot; was also definitely spelled wrong, and I am just trying to correct the other misspellings now. 

I am also interested in whether people think it is better to begin lessons in transcription and then gradually add the alphabet, or begin by introducing the whole alpahabet right at the beginning? I will open this topic on the talk page of the [[Persian/Contents]].

It would be great if you might be interested in editing the book as well, and I am hoping to contact some Persian-speaking editors from Wikipedia to help. [[User:Poppy|Poppy]] 19:19, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

== Transcription or Persian alphabet ==
Is it better to begin lessons in transcription and introduce the alphabet later or to begin with the alphabet and work from there? [[User:Poppy|Poppy]] 19:23, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

==Some encouragement==

As someone trying to self-learn Persian, I've been happy to see any progress at all on the website. For anyone with knowledge of Persian, thanks for your contributions so far, and please keep it up!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are accessing your application with URLs that look like http://localhost:45437/cgi-bin/WebObjects/AppName.woa/  (with the xxx:portnum instead of xxxx/-portnum) ... then you are using the [[Programming:WebObjects/Web Applications/Development/Direct Connect|Evil Direct Connect]].  See that page for why you don't want to be using Direct Connect.  See this page for how to stop.


=== Turn on Apache ===
Go to '''System Preferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; Services''' and turn on '''Personal Web Sharing''' if it is not already on.

=== Edit Apache Config ===
Note: '''Do NOT try to use the Bonjour / Rendezvous name of your machine in this step.'''  It will cause you grief.  Accept this and don't even try.  You have been warned.

Edit '''/etc/httpd/httpd.conf''', find the line containing '''ServerName''' and change it to this:
&lt;pre&gt;
ServerName localhost
&lt;/pre&gt;

That line may be commented out by default.  You can simply uncomment it (remove the leading pound sign) and then restart apache:

&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apachectl restart
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Tell wotaskd to Use Localhost Too ===
Edit '''/System/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/Contents/Resources/Properties'''

Add this line after the '''WOPort=1085''' one:
&lt;pre&gt;
WOHost=localhost
&lt;/pre&gt;
Now you need to restart wotaskd:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo systemstarter stop &quot;WebObjects Services&quot;
sudo systemstarter start &quot;WebObjects Services&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

or

restart wotaskd and womonitor with launchctl if your WebObjects install launches that way.

=== Finally, Configure your Application ===
Add or edit these launch parameters:
&lt;pre&gt;
–WODirectConnectEnabled false
-WOHost localhost
-WOAdaptorURL http://localhost/cgi-bin/WebObjects
–WOPort 5555
&lt;/pre&gt;
The WOPort is optional, but useful if you want consistent URLs for bookmarks and such.  You can use any number you want, but it needs to be unique for each application you launch (or rather, you can only run one app instance on a given WOPort at a time).  In WOLips, WOPort, WODirectConnectEnabled, and WOAdaptorURL already exist and just need to be updated.  WOHost does not, and needs to be added.  The dash in front of the name (&quot;-WOHost&quot;) is important and must be in the name for the setting to work properly.

You may want to set this in your global WOLips settings so you don't have to set it every time you make a new launch configuration.  You will need to go back and modify existing launch configurations with these settings even if you set it globally.  Global settings only apply to newly created launch configurations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''6502 assembly''' contains a grand total of 151 valid opcodes; we can ignore the 105 undefined opcodes that some sources reference.  Because of this small set, ''6502 assembly language'' allows us to quickly conjure hypothetical machines based on non-existent hardware, define memory mappings for this hardware, and then proceed to define simple programs for the hardware.

This page of the ''Hacking'' Wikibook takes advantage of this to submerge the reader deeper into the guts of a bare CPU; although other CPUs have different instruction sets, the core function of operating flags, registers, memory, and the stack remain the same.  More advanced CPUs utilize protected memory; but even then, the function of delivering and handling a signal matches closely with the function of delivering and handling an interrupt.

=Adjectives=

==Overview of Adjectives==

An adjective is simply any word that describes a noun, such as an object or subject in a sentence. Of course, whole phrases may be used to describe nouns, but adjectives are individual words. In English, for example:

The '''red''' dog attacked the '''crazy''' fox.

An adjective can also be used in a sentence opposite a form of &quot;to be.&quot;

The boy is '''good'''.

In Latin, the same is true.

==Adjectives in Latin==

Like nouns, adjectives in Latin are declined. The vast majority take either the first and second declension (''antiquus -a -um'') or the third declension (''ferox, ferocis''). All such adjectives must agree with the nouns they describe in gender, number, and case.

Most third declension adjectives do not have separate masculine and feminine forms. (Neuter adjectives follow the third declension neuter pattern.)

First and second declension adjectives have three distinct genders. Feminine adjectives require the first declension, masculine the second (masculine pattern), and neuter the second (neuter pattern).

These words will look like the adjective '''antiquus''' (old, ancient):
:''antiquus'' (masculine), ''antiqua'' (feminine), ''antiquum'' (neuter). 

Third declension adjectives typically look more like '''ferox''', '''ferocis''' (wild, bold).

Adjectives &lt;u&gt;often&lt;/u&gt; come '''after the word they describe'''. (But since word order is not central to the meaning of a Latin sentence, the adjective &lt;u&gt;may appear anywhere&lt;/u&gt; within the sentence. In poetry, for example, several words often separate an adjective from the noun it modifies.)

For example:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | '''Explanation'''- The ''good'' boy loves the ''wild'' dog.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || puer || '''bonus''' || amat&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; || canem&lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; (acc) || '''ferocem'''&lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; (acc).
|-
| ''English:'' || [The] boy || '''good''' || [he] loves || [the] dog || '''wild'''. 
|}
* &lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt; ''amāre'', [to] love. ''amat'', [he] loves.
* &lt;sup&gt;(2)&lt;/sup&gt; ''canis'', dog (masc.)
* &lt;sup&gt;(3)&lt;/sup&gt; ''ferox, ferocis'', wild. ''ferocem'' (acc.)

''Bonus'', a first and second declension adjective, is masculine, nominative, and singular to agree with ''puer'', the word it is describing.

''Ferocem'', a third declension adjective, is masculine, accusative, and singular to agree with ''canem''. ''Canem'' is accusative because it is the object of ''amat''.

Here is an example of plural adjectives:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | '''Explanation'''- The ''good'' boys love the ''wild'' dogs.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || Puerī (plur) || '''bonī''' (plur)|| amant (plur) || canes (plur, acc) || '''feroces''' (plur, acc).
|-
| ''English:'' || [The] boys || '''good''' || [they] love || [the] dogs || '''wild'''. 
|}

The words  ''bonus'' and ''ferocem'' become ''boni'' and ''feroces'' to agree with the plurals ''pueri'' and ''canes''.

However, if a girl ([[wiktionary:en:puella#Latin|puella]]) happened to love that boy:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | '''Explanation'''- The ''good'' girl loves the ''good'' boy.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || Puella || '''bona'''|| amat || puerum (acc) || '''bonum''' (acc).
|-
| ''English:'' || [The] girl|| '''good''' || [she] loves || [the] boy|| '''good'''. 
|}

''Bonus'' must become ''bona'' in order to modify ''puella'', which is feminine.

Finally, if the girl isn't good, but rather wild:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | '''Explanation'''- The ''wild'' girl loves the ''good'' boy.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || Puella || '''ferox'''|| amat || puerum (acc) || '''bonum''' (acc).
|-
| ''English:'' || [The] girl|| '''wild''' || [she] loves || [the] boy|| '''good'''. 
|}

Even though ''puella'' is first declension, ''ferox'' remains third declension. In the same way, a good lion would be ''bonus leo''.

Adjectives must agree in gender, number, and case, but '''not necessarily in declension'''.

==Exercise==

{{Latin/Exercise|Translate|
# est bonus. • sum ferox. • estis boni. • sunt bonae.
|
# He is good. • I am wild. • You (pl.) are good. • They are good.

&lt;!-- Lesson --&gt;
[[File:Mir-i Arab madrasah.jpg|350px|An old Madrassa in Bukhara|thumb|right|An old Madrassa in Bukhara.]]
This lesson is divided up into several sections. After your done you'll be ready to have your very first conversation in Uzbek. Sure, it'll be real simple—but you'll know how to greet somebody, introduce yourself, ask some polite questions, and say goodbye. If you want to do it intensive (which I'd recommend) you can do this all as one lesson. If you don't have much time the dialogues are broken up into four sections—just do one. (Eventually I think we'll merge all four tiny dialogues)

==Cultural Notes==
For many years Soviet histories portrayed Central Asia as a backward area with no tradition of scholarship and learning. In fact, education in the region was widespread and well developed long before the nineteenth century Russian conquest. There existed a large network of &quot;old style&quot; primary (maktab) and higher (madrasa) schools, which taught religious subjects. In those days many children studied at ''maktabs'' in their own neighborhoods. Some continued their studies for another ten years at a ''madrasa''.

After the Russian conquest, the tsarist administraion established schools with instruction in Russian for the indigenous nationalities. These trained a small number of Central Asians to serve the tsarist administration. Around the turn of the century, reform minded local intelligengtsia called ''iadids'' opened &quot;new style&quot; schools (''usul-i jadid''). Unlike the &quot;old style&quot; schools, the ''jadid'' schools taught secular subjects.

Both the &quot;old style&quot; and the &quot;new style&quot; schools disappeared in the 1920s. Today Uzbekistan has educational institutions developed after the Soviet model, including primary and secondary schools, specialized technical schools, and institutes and universities. . . '''--The rest of the information from the peace corps manual is dated. Any important cultural fact about education can go here--'''

==Grammar and Vocabulary Explanations==
===For Dialogue 1===
In Uzbek the infinitive is formed by adding the suffix ''-moq'' to the verbal stem:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples of -moq|||0|2|}}
|-
| eshitmoq
| to listen
|-
| yozmoq
| to write
|-
| o’qimoq
| to read
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;
Without the infinitive or any other suffix, the Uzbek verbal stem is identical to the second person singular or imperative which is used in familiar or sometimes impolite situations:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|||0|2|}}
|-
| eshit!
| listen!
|-
| yoz!
| write!
|-
| o’qi!
| read!
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;
To express the imperative for singular and plural in a polite manner, the suffix ''-ing'' is added to a verbal stem ending in a consonant. The suffix ''-ng'' is added to a stem ending in a vowel:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|||0|3|}}
|-
| eshit+ing
| listen
|-
| yoz+ing
| write
|-
| o’qi+ing
| read
|-
|}

In the sentence ''gapni yozing'' the suffix ''-ni'' indicates the accusative case and expresses the idea of a definite quality. It is equivalent to English 'the':&lt;br&gt;
{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|Suffix -ni|0|4|}}
|-
|gapni yozing
|-
|sentence+the write+you
|-
|(Write the sentence!)
|-
|}

====Pronunciation Notes====
Pronounce the letters ''ng'' as one sound as in the American English '''ng''' in the word ''so'''ng''''', and not as two sounds '''n''' and '''g''' as in English 'in good standing'.

Imperative sentences are pronounced in Uzbek with a falling intonation on the last syllable:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|||0|3|}}
|-
|sekin o’qing 
|read slowly
|-
|}

===For Dialogue 2===
The negative of a verb is formed by adding the suffix ''-ma'' to the stem of the verb before adding any of the tense or person suffixes:

{| {{Uzbek table|Example| Negative of a verb (-ma suffix) ||0|4||}}
|-
| yozi
| write!
| yozma!
| don't write!
|-
| o’qi
| read!
| o’qima!
| don't read!
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The word ''tushunmayman'' is a negative verb in the present-future tense and can mean 'I do not understand' or 'I will not understand.' It is formed by adding the suffix ''-i'' to the negative form of the verb:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|The negative of a verb (-ma suffix) and present-future tense (-i suffix)||0|4|}}
|-
|tushun+ma+i+man&lt;br&gt;
|understand+not+do/will+I&lt;br&gt;
|I (will) do not understand
|-
|}

As in English, an adjective always stands before the noun it qualifies:

{| {{Uzbek table|Example|||0|4|}}
|-
| yaxshi tilak
|-
| good wish
|-
|}

''Aytishingiz mumkin'' (you can say) consists of a verbal noun ''aytishingiz'' (your saying) and a verbal predicate ''mumkin'' (it is possible).

The expression ''Sog’ bo’ling!'' (Be healthy) is used by Uzbeks to wish each other well when saying goodbye.

===For Dialogue 3===
The locative case suffix ''-da'' is attached to nouns and has the meaning of 'at,' 'in,' 'on':

{| {{Uzbek table|Example| Negative of a verb (-ma suffix) ||0|4||}}
|-
| uy
| home
| uyda
| at home
|-
| yakshanba
| Sunday
| yakshanbada
| on Sunday
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The verbal forms of ''o’qidim'' (I read), ''qildingiz'' (you did) etc. . . contain the definite past tense suffix ''-di''. This suffix is added to the verb stem and indicates in a factual manner that an action was completed in the recent past:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|||0|3|}}
|-
| xat yozdim
| I wrote a letter (and finished writing it)
|-
|}

====Sentence Patterns====
When a word needs to be emphasized, it is usually placed immediately before the predicate:

{| {{Uzbek table|Examples|||0|4|}}
|-
|Yakshabada men uyda bo’ldim
|Men uyda yakshanbada bo’ldim
|-
|Sunday+on I home+at was+I
|I home+at Sunday+on was+I
|-
|I was at home on Sunday
|I was at home on Sunday
|-
|}

==Uzbek Proverb==
{| {{Uzbek table|Proverb|||0|2|}} 
|[[image:Cquote1.svg‎]]Sog’ tanda -- sog’lom aql[[image:Cquote2.svg‎]]
|-
|Translation: In the healthy body is a healthy mind.
|-
|Meaning:Sound body = Sound mind
|-
|}

==Recap==
&lt;!-- Recap --&gt;
Congratulations! You can know have your first ever conversation in Uzbek--and that wasn't that hard either? Was it? 

In future editions of this book we might have excersizes and such, so that you can practice what you learned, and really get it to soak in--and also so you can double check and make sure you know it. But they aren't available just yet :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Imperative=

==Positive Imperative==
===English===
In English (and in Latin), the positive imperative is a command. For example:

* '''Do''' it!
* '''Stop''', in the name of love!
* '''Take''' out the garbage!

===Latin===

In Latin, the imperative singular is found by taking the last two letters off of the infinitive. The six exceptions to this rule are dicere (dic), ducere (duc), facere (fac), velle, malle (infinitives not used) and nolle (noli). Ferre (fer) and esse (es) are often considered  irregular due to the lack of a vowel at the end but we can see that applying the rule of removing the last two letters forms the imperatives correctly.

====Examples:====

Run, boy!
:'''''Curre''', puer!''&lt;ref&gt;In many cases, the vocative will be used with the imperative, unless the imperative is used in a conversation or at a reader, as in a letter or guide.&lt;/ref&gt; (from ''curro, currere''; to run)


Go!
:'''''I!''''' (from ''eo, ire''; to go)


)


&lt;references /&gt;

====Questions====
'''Write out: '''

#Love me, Octavia! (to love = ''amo, amare'')
#Come to Rome! (to come = ''venio, venire''; Rome = ''Roma, Romae, f.'')

===Plural===
To form the plural imperative in Latin, take the 2nd person plural present form of the verb (eg. amatis, sedetis, regitis, venitis) and replace the is at the end with e. The only exceptions to the rule are velle, malle (imperatives not used) and nolle (nolite). Ferre (ferte) and esse (este) are often considered irregular but applying the rule (fertis -&gt; ferte, estis -&gt; este) correctly forms the imperatives.

Go home, boys!
: '''''Ite''' domum, pueri.''

Stay, all of you!
: '''''Manete''', omnes!''

====Exercises====

Write out:

#Take them, men! (to take = ''adripio, adripere'')
#Fear me, children! (to fear = ''timeo, timere''; children = ''liberi'')

==Negative Imperative==

===English===
In English, we use the word &quot;don't&quot; for prohibitions, or negative imperatives. For example:

*'''Don't do''' it!

*'''Don't say''' that!

===Latin===
Similarly, in Latin the negative imperative is formed with two words, the imperative of ''nolo, nolle'' and the infinitive.

''Nolo'' by itself means &quot;I do not want,&quot; but in its imperative it means &quot;do not...!&quot; 

''Nolle'' is irregular, and its imperative forms are ''noli'' and ''nolite''.

====Examples====

Do not fear me!
:'''''Noli''' me '''timere'''!''

Don't build the aqueduct there, soldiers!
:'''''Nolite''' aquaeductum ibi '''aedificare''', milites!''

Don't wash the dog, boys!
:'''''Nolite''', pueri, canem '''lavare'''!''

====Exercises====

Translate:

#Don't cry, daughter! (to cry = ''fleo, flere'')
#Don't hurt me, friends! (to hurt = ''vulnero, vulnerare'')
#Don't go into the water, boys!
#Don't hurt them, soldiers! (them = use ''eos'', masculine accusative plural of ''is, ea, id'')

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Latin}}

== Imperfect Active Indicative ==

The imperfect is a construct like:
&lt;br&gt;'''I was seeing.'''
&lt;br&gt; In Latin it would look like this:
&lt;br&gt;'''Videbam.'''

English has a similar construct called progressive past. Actions seem incomplete, and so the imperfect label. For example, &quot;I was running,&quot; &quot;We were sailing,&quot; &quot;They were calling.&quot; Note that 'to be' is always there. Latin, however, would sometimes use imperfect like simple past; accordingly, &quot;We were sailing&quot; could be translated as &quot;We sailed.&quot; Other translations of imperfect can be used to/kept such as &quot;We used to sail/We kept sailing.&quot; 

Regardless of language, the concept of an imperfect is important. Imperfect is called imperfect for a reason - in Latin, the verb &quot;perficere&quot; means to finish/complete, which is what perfect is from. Thus, imperfect, in the grammatical sense, means not finished - that the action could be or could not be completed. Perfect instead means it has been finished - I saw. You have already seen, and it is now completed. I was seeing implies that the action is not yet completed.

The perfect tense, which we will learn later, is a more immediate reference to the past. The name, imperfect, helps you remember its use: in situations where you can't say when an event started or ended or happened, you must use the imperfect.

In situations where you can know when an event started or ended or happened, use the perfect. 

You conjugate the imperfect tense this way:
verb + ba + personal ending

The endings for imperfect are:

Sg.
&lt;br&gt;1. '''-bam'''
&lt;br&gt;2. '''-bas'''
&lt;br&gt;3. '''-bat'''
&lt;br&gt;Pl.
&lt;br&gt;1. '''-bamus'''
&lt;br&gt;2. '''-batis'''
&lt;br&gt;3. '''-bant'''

Note that the only thing we add are ba + the personal endings (the same as in the present tense) to the infinitive stem. This gives us the imperfect conjugation.

Note that in third and fourth conjugations, you will have to form it differently. There is *no* rule to explain this, it just is, although there are memorization techniques that can help.

ven&lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re is 4th conjugation and is formed like:
veniebam
veniebas 
veniebat 
veniebamus
veniebatis 
veniebant

For third conjugation, an example used in some textbooks/study guides is: capere (to capture or seize) 

capiebam
capiebas
capiebat
capiebamus
capiebatis
capiebant

Note that it is easiest to think of what the endings -ere and &lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re lack. The imperfect -ba + the personal ending, which we can call the imperfect conjugation,  must be prefixed by ie.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{latin}}

== Future I, Passive ==

Future active is a tense which, unsurprisingly, refers to something which has not yet happened. The endings are fairly basic, and follow fairly regular rules - however, the future endings used in 1st and 2nd conjugation differ from the endings of 3rd, 3rd-io (not a typo!), and 4th.

For example - &quot;amo, amare&quot; (1st conjugation) would be

Ama bo - I will love&lt;br&gt;*
Ama bis - You will love&lt;br&gt;
Ama bit - He/She/It will love&lt;br&gt;
Ama bimus - We will love&lt;br&gt;
Ama bitis - Y'all will love&lt;br&gt;
Ama bunt - They will love&lt;br&gt;*
* 1st person singular and 3rd person plural use bo and bunt, not bi.
Note the B and the BIs - the distinguishing feature of future tense in Latin.

With &quot;venio, venire&quot; (4th conjugation--io), however, the endings are different. In future, this is what they look like:

Veni am - I will come &lt;br&gt;
Veni es - You will come&lt;br&gt;
Veni et - He/She/It will come&lt;br&gt;
Veni emus - We will come&lt;br&gt;
Veni etis - Y'all will come&lt;br&gt;
Veni ent - They will come &lt;br&gt;

[deleted paragraphs go here. deleted to maintain rigorous accuracy, which we will go back to striving for.)

To clarify: ven&lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re, venio.. we know it is 4th conjugation verb and if we look at its first person singular conjugation, we see that it is an io verb, because the conjugation of the first person singular is &quot;ven'''i'''o&quot;. (an io category exists within 3rd and fourth conjugations and is a more general concept which we will briefly introduce here by using venire, venio as an example).

Let's first identify what we know.

We know it is 4th conjugation -io because it ends in &lt;U&gt;i&lt;/U&gt;re, which tells us that it is 4th conjugation, and io because its nominative singular ends in io (venio). Because it is io, we leave the i in. So, when we are asked (as all textbooks should phrase these &lt;B&gt;new&lt;/B&gt; questions):

1. What are the steps to form the future 2nd person conjugation?

We say:

1. It is better to know more than you need: check the infinitive nominative singular, we now know that it is 4th conjugation io.
2. We now know that we can form the stem: the stem is veni and can then add a personal ending--leaving in the i. We leave in the i because it is io. Because it looks weird, we never leave the i in the future perfect. 

What is the form for venire, in the future tense, in the 2nd person?

The answer is venies.

==If==
&lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt;, '''PRGM:CTL:1''', requires a criteria argument (condition) to be stated immediately afterwards which will allow the program to determine whether the following instructions are to be executed.  The argument or arguments (which will be referred to as a condition) is a boolean result, meaning that they will be true (non-zero, ie 1) or false (zero, ie 0).  For more help on booleans, see the Boolean Reference (somewhere not yet).

A simple If is used when the programmer wishes to test for a condition, then execute '''one''' instruction (following the if statement) if the condition returns true.

===Syntax: If===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:If ''condition''
:''statement''
}}
*where ''condition'' is any statement resulting in a zero or non zero result
**if ''condition'' returns true (again, non-zero), ''statement'' is executed
**if ''condition'' returns false (zero) ''statement'' is not executed

===Ex: If===
The following example demonstrates a very basic If statement that will display &quot;x &gt; Five&quot;:
{{bcode:Example|
:6&amp;rarr;X
:If X&gt;5
:Disp &quot;X &gt; FIVE!&quot;
}}
It will display &quot;x &gt; Five&quot; because the condition x&gt;5 (6 is greater than 5) returns true.  If x had been 3, condition would return false (3 is not greater than 5),and nothing would display.

===Ex: If One===
The following program will always display &quot;Hello World&quot; because the condition 1 will always return 1 (which is non-zero) and therefore the condition is always true
{{bcode:Example|
:If 1
:Disp &quot;Hello World&quot;
}}
and likewise the following will never display &quot;Goodbye&quot; because it always returns 0
{{bcode:Example|
:If 0
:Disp &quot;Goodbye World&quot;
}}

==If Then End (If Then)==
&lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; '''PRGM:CTL:1''' &lt;tt&gt;Then&lt;/tt&gt; '''PRGM:CTL:2''' &lt;tt&gt;End&lt;/tt&gt; '''PRGM:CTL:7''' conditional statements (more commonly known as &lt;tt&gt;If Then&lt;/tt&gt; statements) are used when more than one statement must be executed if a condition returns true.  It is very much like the simple &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; statement, with the obvious difference that multiple statments are executed instead of one.
===Syntax If Then===
The &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; statement requires a condition, then a &lt;tt&gt;Then&lt;/tt&gt; command must follow on the next line, followed by one or more statements which will execute if the condition returns true.  The &lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; block is ended by a &lt;tt&gt;End&lt;/tt&gt; statement which tells the calculator that all following statments are to be executed as normal.
{{bcode:Syntax|
:If ''condition''
:Then
:''statement1''
:''statement2''
:''statementn''
:End
}}
*Where condition is any statement resulting in a true or false result.
**if condition returns true, statement1, statement2... statementn (all statements between Then and End) will execute
**if condition returns false, the statements between Then and End are not executed, and the program continues with the first statement after End

===Ex: If Then===
{{bcode:Example|
:If x&lt;u&gt;&gt;&lt;/u&gt;5
:Then
:Disp x
:x+1&amp;rarr;x
:Disp x
:End
}}

{{bcode:Output|
6
7
}}
if x = 6, but would display nothing if x was less than five

==If Then Else End==
&lt;tt&gt;If&lt;/tt&gt; '''PRGM:CTL:1''' &lt;tt&gt;Then&lt;/tt&gt; '''PRGM:CTL:2''' &lt;tt&gt;Else&lt;/tt&gt; '''PRGM:CTL:3''' &lt;tt&gt;End&lt;/tt&gt; '''PRGM:CTL:7''' 
If elses are used when the programmer needs to make a choice where if the condition returns non-zero, statements are executed, but if the condition returns zero, other statements are executed.  Either way, only one set of instructions are executed
===Syntax: Else If===
{{bcode:Syntax|
:If ''condition''
:Then
:''trueStatements''
:Else
:''falseStatments''
:End
}}
*Where condition is any statement resulting in a zero or non zero result.
**if condition returns nonzero, trueStatments (insructions between Then and Else) will execute, then the instruction after End is executed
**if condition returns zero, falseStatements (instructions between Else and End) are executed, then the instruction after End is executed

===Ex: Else If===
{{bcode:Example|
:If X&lt;u&gt;&gt;&lt;/u&gt;5
:Then
:Disp &quot;Hello World I'm&quot;
:Disp &quot;Big like five&quot;
:Else
:Disp &quot;Goodbye World&quot;
:Disp &quot;I'm small like four&quot;
:End
}}
Would display
{{bcode:Output|
Hello World I'm
Big like Five
}}
if X were greater than or equal to five, but would display the following if X were less than five
{{bcode:Output|
Goodbye World
I'm small like four
}}

===Syntax: While===
&lt;tt&gt;While&lt;/tt&gt; loop executes a block of commands between the While and End commands as long as the specified condition is true. The condition is tested at the beginning of the loop (when the End command is encountered), so if the condition is initially false, the block of commands will never get executed.
{{bcode:Syntax|
:While ''condition is true''
:''statement''
:End
}}
*where ''condition'' is any statement resulting in a zero or non zero result

      <text xml:space="preserve">How much water needs to be boiled?  Are the solids or the water put in the refrigerator?


The amount of water just needs to be enough to melt the butter into.  Just use one or two parts more water than butter and add more water if/when the water level drops from evaporation.

and the solids (Butter and the THC dissolved into it) go into the fridge.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">this page is a mess. I wouldnt reccomend anyone use it. I started correcting it without realizing just how bad it is. The language is informal, it doesnt discuss the differences between a rhetorical essay and a exhibition essay. If people are really supposed to try to learn how to write a five point essay from this it needs a lot of work. 

Am i the only one who feels this way?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the year 1826, the first photograph ever taken was developed by Nicéphore Niépce. The picture was not that clear and it took over 8 hours to expose.&lt;BR&gt; [[File:View from the Window at Le Gras, Joseph Nicéphore Niépce.jpg|300px]]&lt;BR&gt;Since then photography has expanded by leaps and bounds[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography]. In the 1990's. Quicktime introduced the Quicktime VR, which allows you to create an almost interactive photograph that emulates a 3D space. This surprised everyone, and the technology was so new. Photography has now been taken to another level using VRs again. To create a VR, a photographer must set a tripod up with a specialized head. The photographer precedes to take shots of the surrounding environment at various angles.  The photographer must then import the photos into a &quot;VR stitcher&quot;, where they will &quot;stitch&quot; together the shots taken in the field to produce a single spherical scene that can then be navigated in Quicktime. A company named Z360 introduced time-lapse VRs. It is a VR environment with moving pictures or action moving in the pictures. &quot;Z360 is a company that combines photographic imagery and digital delivery to create dynamic and informative displays for on-line communication. Unlike many multimedia developers, we provide a complete service, allowing us to control quality and create an efficient workflow specifically tailored to your requirements.
This site shows a wide range of examples which mostly require Quicktime, but look out for Java or Flash examples. In the age of broadband, we believe our approach becomes increasingly valuable, providing a fast, immersive and truly user led experience&quot;[http://www.z360.com]. Their Motion Vr and Panorama VJ are ingenious. 
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Motion VR (http://z360.com/motion/prim.htm)&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;Panorama VJ (http://z360.com/vj/bad.htm)&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;

The future of interactive photography will excite even the novice photographer. As more and more software becomes available, photography is dramatically moving toward becoming a completely digital media.

==NHL Classification Schemes==
*'''Rappaport classification (1966)''' &amp;mdash; oldest
**Developed by the AFIP (Armed Forces Institute of Pathology)
**Was before lymphomas were divided into B and T cells
**Well-differentiated or poorly-differentiated or histiocytic (large cell) lymphoma

*'''Kiel classification (1974)'''
**Used in Europe
**Low grade and high grade, T cell and B cell
**Low grade B cell: Lymphocytic (chronic lymphocytic and prolymphocytic leukemia, hairy-cell leukemia), Lymphoplasmacytic/cytoid, Plasmacytic, Centroblastic/centrocytic (follicular or diffuse), Centrocytic
**High grade B cell: Centroblastic, Immunoblastic, Large cell anaplastic, Burkitt's lymphoma, Lymphoblastic

*'''Lukes and Collins (1974)'''
**Separates B and T cells using immunologic typing. Was used in the United States.

*'''Working Formulation (1982)'''
**Devised to translate among the many different classification systems
**Was based only on morphology. Based on low-power architectural arrangement (i.e. diffuse vs follicular proliferation) and high-power cytologic characteristics (nuclear outline: cleaved vs non-cleaved; cell size: small, large, or mixed).  Does not consider B or T cell lineage.
**low, intermediate, high grades. Special studies not used. Only 10 categories. Used letters A-J and grouped according to prognosis.
**&lt;u&gt;Low grade&lt;/u&gt; (groups A-C): small lymphocytic, follicular small-cleaved cell, follicular mixed small-cleaved and large cell.
**&lt;u&gt;Intermediate grade&lt;/u&gt; (D-G): follicular large cell, diffuse small cleaved cell (Mantle cell), diffuse mixed small and large cell, diffuse large cell
**&lt;u&gt;High grade&lt;/u&gt; (H-J): Large cell immunoblastic, lymphoblastic, small non-cleaved cell (Burkitt and non-Burkitt)
**Reference: PMID 6896167 - &quot;National Cancer Institute sponsored study of classifications of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: summary and description of a working formulation for clinical usage. The Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Pathologic Classification Project.&quot; Cancer. 1982 May 15;49(10):2112-35.

*'''WHO/REAL (1994)''' (Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms)
**Introduced by the International Lymphoma Study Group (ILSG) in 1994
**Reference: PMID 8068936 (1994) -- &quot;A revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms: a proposal from the International Lymphoma Study Group.&quot; (Harris NL, Blood. 1994 Sep 1;84(5):1361-92.)
**Incorporates morphology, immunophenotype, genetic features, clinical features
**Is not based on prognosis (unlike Working Formulation); treats each lymphoma as a separate disease process with a spectrum of aggressiveness (such as breast cancers).
**About 25 categories (includes all lymphoid neoplams: Hodgkins lymphoma, non-Hodgkins, leukemias, plasma cell neoplasms, etc.). Also has myeloid, mast cell, and Langerhans cell diseases.
**WHO (World Health Organization) adopted the REAL classification
**Reference: PMID 10577857 (1999) -- &quot;World Health Organization classification of neoplastic diseases of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues: report of the Clinical Advisory Committee meeting-Airlie House, Virginia, November 1997.&quot; (Harris NL, J Clin Oncol. 1999 Dec;17(12):3835-49.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nowadays, the companies need to compete fiercely with other competitors. The employees are the vital resources of the success of the companies so the companies need to provide more benefits for retaining the good performance of employees. Besides, in order to reduce the turnover rate of the companies and save the amount of cost of the recruitment, the employers offer the various compensations for the employees.   
 
The benefits have two types, the financial benefits and non-financial benefits. The financial benefits divide into direct and indirect benefits. The direct benefits are wages, salaries, commissions and bonuses. The indirect benefits include social security, family and medical leave and so on. The non-financial benefits comprise working conditions, flexible working time and the appropriate status symbols. 

If the employees receive the financial benefits from the employers, they will have a sense of belonging of companies and have a well cooperation with the employers. Moreover, providing the benefits for the employees can increase the productivity of the firm because the employees can work more efficiency and efficient.

However, the human have different expectations in the life so the financial benefits can not satisfy their whole expectations. The company needs to provide non-financial benefits to satisfy the employees’ needs. For examples, if the companies cater the comfortable and harmonious environment for the employees, the employees will have well morale and concentrate on the work.

The companies adopt the different benefits to satisfy the need of the employees. The financial benefits have the merits and demerit. The non-financial benefits also have the advantages and disadvantages.

== The factor included in financial benefits ==

'''Financial benefits'''
	The financial benefits can divide into two major categories: direct financial compensation and indirect financial compensation. 
	Direct financial compensation
The financial rewards are paid directly to the employees, such as wages, salaries, commissions and bonuses.
	Indirect financial compensation
The indirect financial compensation can divide into two parts: legally required benefits and voluntary benefits. These benefits are not paid directly to the employees. 
 
The Legally Required Benefits includes social security, unemployment compensation and worker’s compensation. 
Social Security generally includes retirement benefit, disability insurance, Medicare etc. 
Unemployment Compensation is paid when the employee is laid off by the company. 
Worker’s Compensation is paid when the job-related accidents or illness was happened. 

[[Image:HandwritingEmperorXianfeng_002.jpg|thumb]]
 
The Voluntary Benefits are paid indirectly to the employees and not tied to an employee’s performance. The following are some voluntary benefits the companies always provide: 
Payment for Time Not Worked is provided payment to the employees for time not worked. For example, the companies can provide vacations to employees when the employees don’t need to work. Also the companies can provide payment for jury duty, voting time and bereavement time. 
Health Benefits includes health care, dental and vision care. 
Employee Services includes relocation benefits, child care service, educational assistance, food service, financial services, discount on company products etc. These benefits are specially offered to some companies’ employees only. 
Premium Pay is paid to the employees when they work under extremely dangerous conditions or undesirable hours. 
Benefits for part-time employees are paid to the part-time employees in order to remain their working desire.
Moreover, the Voluntary Benefits also include life insurance, retirement plans, employee stock option plans, supplemental unemployment benefits etc. 

'''Non-financial benefits'''
	The Job
Sometimes, the job may give the employees more intangible benefits. When the employees work in companies, they will feel their job is worthwhile. For example, employees can learn more useful knowledge and skills. They can improve themselves when they are working. The job can satisfy the employees’ desire. The job seems give them more intangible benefits than wages. 
	Job Environment
If employees work in satisfied job environments, they will feel valued and work hard. Sometimes, the job environments are more important than direct financial benefits such as wages and salaries. If employees work in comfortable environments, they can work more happily. For example, employees always prefer working in a safe environment to work in a dangerous environment because the safety is more important than the number of money.

== The determinants of those benefits ==


Not matter financial benefits or non-financial benefits, all the employees would feel appreciate if the employers provide more and more. 
However, every employee has their own decision, if they can choose the benefits they want. It doesn’t matter how good the proposed benefit is. The main purpose of a benefit program is to make the employee feel better about the company, which they will do only if they value whatever it is employers are giving to them. 
So, the employee’s need is the main determinants of the benefits.

'''Financial benefits'''
For most of employees, financial may be the major condition when they apply the job. Actually, this kind of benefits can be used for supporting their daily expenditure and saving. Realists are concerning this benefit very much. The financial benefits are tangible. For example, Company A gives Ben a 301(k) and 5 holidays per month. And Company B gives Ben a 325(K0 and 5 holidays per month. It is easier to compare the financial benefits they are providing. Based on this characteristic, it becomes the major condition when they decide to accept the job.
 
'''Non-financial benefits'''

[[Image:003Cracow.jpg|thumb]]
 
This is a kind of intangible benefits. Sometimes, it is easy to be ignored. But, for some people who are seeking for the psychological satisfactions may emphasize the non-financial benefits. Based on the Maslow Theory, the diagramed shows the Maslow Pyramid. The top one is self-actualization. That means they are finding the self-fulfillment and realize one’s potential. And the job can satisfy the employees’ desire. May be the number of people who stay in “self-actualization” is very limited. But, they are exalted by the society. For example, the Medical Sans Frontieres provide emergency medical assistance to populations in danger. Although they are given the allowance for the base need, but they are still willing to join this prgamme. It is because their self actualization needs is large than the phsiological needs. They are enjoying the intargible benefits more than salary.  

Therefore, all the employees have their own needs. In order to maximize the utility of benefits, the employers should ask the employees what they want. Or the employers can found a compensation consultant to do a survey for them.

== Example ==
 
When you decide to do a job, you will think more about the financial benefit or the non financial benefit? In Hong Kong, most of the political persons are by all means in high qualification and they are well educated. What factors will affect them to determine what they choose to do?

Working for a government means that they will have a political right to affect Hong Kong. However, the salary of working for a government is not really high. They can choose to work in a bank in order to get more salary.

We may look at the case of Antony Leung, Mr Leung Kam Chung, who was was the former Financial Secretary of the HKSAR.Before he taking up the post of Financial Secretary, he worked in a bank, starting his banking career as a currency trader. He spent 23 years with Citicorp where he took up regional management positions in investment, corporate and private banking in Hong Kong and overseas. He served in senior management positions at big international banks in Hong Kong.In addition he rose to the rank of Asia-Pacific chairman when he joined Chase Manhatan Corporationin 1996.

What are the reasons for him to give up the job from bank but working as a political person? We will talk about the advantages and the disadvantages of working as a bank and working in the government.  

First of all, we can see that working as a bank can earn a high salary. The salary can be over $10,000,000a year. It is far more about $2400000 a year than the salary of working as a Financial Secretary. 

However,with comparison to work as a political person,working as a bank has its drawsback.It cannot be familarized to the citizen.It cannot be so famous.

As a Financial Secretary of the HKSAR,you may get more non financial benefit to determine you to choose this job.The person represents Hong Kong,the citizen will know more about you.You will have the reputation and maybe you will have the sense of satisfaction due to the fact that you have the right to affect the political of Hong Kong.Moreover,being a staff of the government,you may get the subsidize of housing and medicical care.

However,there are disadvantages to be a Financial Secretary of the HKSAR,you may work under pressure because you take the responsibility of the whole society of Hong Kong.It is serious if you make a wrong decision. You may affect the whole society, but not only concerning to you or a part of the economy.


Therefore, we find that the financial benefit is attractive. However, sometimes people will mainly think of the non financial benefit to find a job. 


== Questionnaire: ==

Are you an employer or employee?

For employee:
1.	Does your company offer the worker’s compensation?
(E.g.: Labor Insurance, medical care etc.)

2.	Do you satisfy with your working environment?

3.	Do you satisfy with your salary?

4.	Will you join another company if she offers you a better salary but not good working environment?

5.	Do you think the financial or Non-financial benefits are more important to you?


For employer:

1.	Do you think the moral of the employee is import?

2.	Will you improve the working environment or increase the salary of the staff with good performance if you have the ability to pay?


We had interviewed 20 people for the survey, there are 17 employees and 3 employers. And they are from the small-scale companies, none of them are civil servant. For the rough and small-scale survey we had done, we got the data below. 


For Employee:

1.What kinds of benefits are you receiving?
(E.g.: Labor Insurance, medical care etc.)

[[Image:Wisla_004.jpg|thumb]]
 
From the above chart, it showed all the employees received the labour insurance, annual leave and MPF benefits, as it is a must for the employer to offer according to the Labour Legislation. However, the health care benefit is not included in this regulation, so there is only a small portion of employees received this kind of benefits. It showed the employers would not offer special benefits to their employee rather than the one under the regulation. 

2.Do you satisfy with your working environment?
3.Do you satisfy with your salary?



According to the data, most of the employees are not satisfied with their salary and the working environment. And, more interviewees satisfied with their salary than the working environment comparatively.

It showed the employers tend to offer a better salary than provide a better working environment, as they conduct some survey to understand the desire of the employees’ preference or the employer did not care about the working environment.
    
4. Will you join another company if she offers a better salary but not good working environment?

[[Image:Vavelio pilis.jpg|thumb]] 


If a company offer a better salary but not good working environment, most employee are not sure whether to join the company or not; it showed the employees are not only considering the salary when they join a company, the working environment will be considered also.


[[Image:Pieniny_007.jpg|thumb]]

5. Do you think the financial or Non-financial benefits are more important to you?

 

A large percentage of the employees think the financial benefits are more import, only 2 interviewees have different opinion, they are the ones who satisfied with their salary. For those who are not satisfied with their salary, they think the salary are more important that the working environment. So, it is difficult to argue whether the financial or the non-financial benefits are more important to the employees, it depends on the real situation the employees are facing at the moment. For this point, in the case study sector will be explained further.  

For Employer:

1.	Do you think the moral of the employee is import?


 

All of the employers interviewed agreed the moral of the staff are important to the business, and it directly affects the staff’s performance. So the employers will pay attention to enhance the moral by different methods, like giving bonus, appreciate the staff orally, etc., And it depends on each different situation what to do to enhance the moral of the employees. 

2. Will you improve the working environment or increase the salary of the staff with good performance if you have the ability to pay?

If the employers have the ability to pay, most of them prefer to increase the salary rather than improve the working environment. But they say it is difficult to make the decision, it will depend on the existing situation. If the salary of their staff is not lower than the other companies, then most probably they may invest to improve the working environment. On the other hand, if they found the salary of their staff is lower than other companies, they will sure to increase the salary instead.


== Conclusion ==
 
To conclude, in most of the countries, the company or the organization will provide the non financial benefit to the employees apart from the financial benefit. Financial can be classified as direct aspect and indirect aspect. In terms of direct aspect, it can be the real money, which means wages, salaries, commissions and bonuses. In terms of the indirect aspect, it means the benefit or welfare that is provided by the company but not in the money aspect. For example, the company will provide health care, life insurance and retirement plans to the employees. It will attract the employees to join the company.                       
 
However, when the employees to decide to stay or leave the company, they will not only think of the financial benefit. They will also consider the non financial benefit such as their sense of satisfaction from the work environment. Their sense of satisfaction can be aroused by the lots of reasons. For example, we may learn how to face the challenge and work under pressure from the work. It may let us gain more experience. It is the advantage of doing the job apart from looking at the salaries.

From the perspective of our group, we think that besides the financial benefit, non financial benefit is very important for the employees. It can to raise the morale and increase the motivation of the employees to perform well in the job. Both employers and the employees can be beneficial from it.

      <comment>/* Common video compression methods and codecs */  several wording changes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You can have and use uncompressed video... if you have LOTs, really LOTs of storage space! That´s why most digital video you find is compressed in some way. More than simply compressed, video is really ''encoded'' by a '''codec''' and then saved in a ''file'' following a certain '''format'''.

=Codec vs Format=
'''Codec''' means &quot;en'''co'''der/'''dec'''oder&quot;. It is a software which compresses the video for storage purposes with a certain algorithm, and sometimes (not always) can decompress the video for playing it as well.

It is very common that people confuses the codec with the file format of a video. There are, indeed, some file formats which require a specific encoding standard. However, this does not mean that only one encoding/decoding software must be used --- there are lots of encoders for MPEG 1 video files, for example. And, more than that, there are file formats which can &quot;store&quot; video compressed in a variety of ways.

The very common AVI file format is an example --- it can store uncompressed video, or video which was compressed by, just to mention one example, an MPEG4-standard codec like XviD, DivX, etc. You may hear people talk about &quot;this DivX video&quot; or similar, but this is not precise --- in fact, a video compressed with the DivX codec is really a MPEG4-standard video, and as such it can be played by any other MPEG4 decoder, like XviD.

Some problems arises from the fact that the AVI format uses an identification string called '''FourCC''' which is used to tell which codec was used for compressing the video. Some applications made for a certain compression standard may refuse to work with a different FourCC code even if the compression method is the same. And people often take the FourCC information as the &quot;format&quot; of the video.

So, to make things clear: codec is the software which compresses video; and there can be lots of codecs which output files in the same format.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of our [[Econometric Theory/Classical Normal Linear Regression Model (CNLRM)|CLR]] assumptions for linear regression is that our disturbance terms are '''homoscedastic''', meaning they have equal scatter (&lt;math&gt;Var(\epsilon) = \sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt;). However, there are times that regressions end up with '''heteroscedastic''' disturbance terms, meaning the scatters are unequal (&lt;math&gt; Var(\epsilon) = \sigma_i^2&lt;/math&gt;).

[[Image:Hetroscedastic.JPG|thumb|Hetroscedastic, Cone shape]]


==Causes of Heteroscedasticity==
Heteroscedasticity are more common in cross-sectional data than in time series. It is usually due to a scale or size factor.

''Example:'' In basic Keynesian economics, we assume that savings and income are determined by wealth and income. Agents that have more wealth and income are more likely to save, this will produce a hetroscedastic relationship.

==Consequences of Hetroscedastity== 

1) OLS Coefficients are still unbiased for true value.
&lt;math&gt; E(\hat{\beta}) = \beta &lt;/math&gt;

Unbiased coefficients depend on &lt;math&gt; E(\epsilon) = 0, cov(x_i,\epsilon_i) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

So the regression is safe from hetroscedasity.  on this assumption. 

2) OLS Coefficients are not efficient. There exists an alternative to the OLS Coefficant that has a smaller variance than the OLS one. &lt;math&gt; \exists_\tilde{\beta} st. var(\tilde{\beta}) &lt; var(\hat{\beta}^{OLS}) where E(\tilde{\beta}) = \beta &lt;/math&gt; and therefore, is more efficient.

3) Hypothesis tests, in the presence of hetroscedasity of an OLS coefficient, based on the standard error of the coefficient are invalid.


Bias in estmated variance of OLS Estimators causes ineffiancies.

Recall: &lt;math&gt; \hat{\beta}^{OLS} = \beta +  \frac{\sum (x_i + \bar{x})\epsilon_i}{\sum(x_i + \bar{x})^2} &lt;/math&gt;

When beta-hat is unbiased, the second term goes to zero. However, with hetroscedasicity, the second term is not zero. 

Derive &lt;math&gt; var(\hat{\beta}^{OLS}) &lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt; var(\epsilon) = \sigma_i^2 &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; var(\hat{\beta}^{OLS}) = var(\frac{\sum (x_i + \bar{x})\epsilon_i}{\sum(x_i + \bar{x})^2}) &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;      = (\frac{1}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2})^2 var(\sum(x_i - \bar{x})\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;      = (\frac{1}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2})^2 \sum var((x_i - \bar{x})\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;      = (\frac{1}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2})^2 \sum x_i - \bar{x})^2 var(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;      = (\frac{1}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2})^2 \sum x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sigma_i^2 &lt;/math&gt;


We can represent the differences in variances in the error term by the matrix Z
 
&lt;math&gt; \sigma_i^2 = Z \sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt;

&quot;...that there were originally intended to be seven Horcruxes, thus giving Voldemort seven extra pieces of his soul.&quot;

This is wrong. If Voldemort did this, then there would be eight pieces to his soul, not seven. I'm going to change it. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Jammi568|Jammi568]] ([[User talk:Jammi568|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jammi568|contribs]]) , 5 April 2007&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:Actually, we don't know. What Tom says is, &quot;What I don't understand, though – just out of curiosity – I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can you only split your soul once? Wouldn't it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces? I mean, for instance, isn't seven the most powerfully magic number, wouldn't seven—?&quot; Slughorn then says how bad it would be to rip the soul into seven pieces, but we don't know if Tom's intent is to rip his soul into seven or to tear off seven shards and secrete them. All we really know is that the number seven has been suggested, and we know of five places where Horcruxes likely are or were: the diary, the signet, Helga Hufflepuff's cup, Salazar Slytherin's locket, and Nagini.

'''''Sedum''''' is the '''stonecrops''', is genus in the family [[../Crassulaceae/]], representing about 400 species of leafy succulents, found throughout the northern hemisphere, varying from annual groundcovers to shrubs. 

==Description==
The plants have water-storing leaves and a typical form of blossom with five petals, seldom four or six. There are typically twice as many stamens as petals.

==Growing conditions==
Well drained soils.  Many sedums are extensively cultivated as garden plants, due to their interesting and attractive appearance and hardiness. The various species differ in their requirements; some are cold-hardy but do not tolerate heat, some require heat but do not tolerate cold.  They are preferred over grass for green roofs, popular in Germany and some other countries.

==Species==
Well known European ''Sedums'' are ''[[../Sedum acre/]]'', ''[[../Sedum album/]]'', ''[[../Sedum dasyphyllum/]]'', ''[[../Sedum reflexum/]]'' (also known as ''[[../Sedum rupestre/]]'') and ''[[../Sedum hispanicum/]]''.

==Uses==
''Sedum reflexum'', known as &quot;stone orpine&quot; or &quot;crooked yellow stonecrop&quot;, is occasionally used as a salad leaf or herb in Europe (and the United Kingdom) [http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Sedum+rupestre]. It has a slightly astringent sour taste

''Sedum acre'' (&quot;biting stonecrop&quot;) on the other hand contains high quantities of piperidine alkaloids (namely (+)-sedridine, (-)-sedamine, sedinone and isopelletierine) which give it a sharp, peppery and acrid taste and make it somewhat toxic. Depending on the amount consumed, irritations of the mucous membranes, cramps and paralysis, including respiratory paralysis may ensue. In ancient Greece, biting stonecrop was used to treat epilepsy and skin diseases, as well as to cause abortions.

'''Bloodroot''' (''Sanguinaria canadensis'') is a perennial, herbaceous flowering plant native to eastern North America from Nova Scotia, Canada southward to Florida, United States. It is the only species in the genus Sanguinaria, and is included in the family Papaveraceae.

Bloodroot is also known as bloodwort, red puccoon root, and sometimes pauson. Bloodroot has also been known as tetterwort in America, although that name is used in Britain to refer to Greater Celandine.

Bloodroot grows to 60 cm tall, with one large, sheath-like basal multi-lobed leaf up to 30 cm across. The flowers are produced from March to May, with 8-12 delicate white petals and yellow reproductive parts that appear to be clasped by the leaf. The flower is short-lived, but the leaf continues to grow until mid-summer, when the plant becomes dormant. Bloodroot stores sap in an underground rhizome the sap is toxic.

==Reproduction and genetics==
Bloodroot is one of many plants whose seeds are spread by ants, a process called myrmecochory. The seeds have a fleshy organ called an elaiosome that attracts ants. The ants take the seeds to their nest, where they eat the elaiosomes, and put the seeds in their nest debris, where they are protected until they germinate. They also get the added bonus of growing in a medium made richer by the ant nest debris.

==Bloodroot produces morphine-like alkaloids==

Bloodroot produces benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, primarily the toxin ''sanguinarine''.  The alkaloids are transported to, and stored in, the rhizome.

===Bloodroot extracts are toxic to animal cells===

Sanguinarine kills animal cells by blocking the action of '''Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase''' transmembrane proteins.  As a result, applying bloodroot to the skin may destroy tissue and lead to the formation of a large scab, called an ''eschar''. Bloodroot and its extracts are thus considered ''escharotic''.

In spite of supposed curative properties, and historical use by Native Americans as an emetic, extreme caution should be used for any internal use.

On 13 Aug 2005, U.S. news media reported that Dan Raber (of Georgia, United States) came under felony investigation for dispensing bloodroot paste to women with breast cancer.  It was reported that nine women developed disfiguring destruction of skin and underlying tissue.  Reports also indicated that Lois March, M.D., who is a practicing physician in Cordele, Georgia, has also come under U.S. FDA investigation for her role in prescribing pain medication to Raber's disfigured customers while their use of bloodroot was ongoing&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwinnettdailypost.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=32&amp;url_article_id=5181&amp;url_subchannel_id=&amp;change_well_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajc.com/health/content/shared-auto/healthnews/prss/527423.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casewatch.org/board/med/march/march.shtml|title=Accusation against Lois March, M.D.|author=Composite State Board of Medical Examiners (Georgia)|date= July 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial uses of sanguinarine extracted from bloodroot===
The United States FDA has approved the inclusion of sanguinarine in toothpastes as an antibacterial or anti-plaque agent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2700895&amp;dopt=Citation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=6585404&amp;dopt=Abstract&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/coscom99.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=2207852&amp;dopt=Citation&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, it is believed that this use may cause leukoplakia, a premalignant oral lesion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaomp.org/brochures/Leukoplakia.pdf Leukoplakia], (pdf format) hosted by the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology.  Page accessed on December 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 Nov 2003, the Colgate-Palmolive Company commented by memorandum (see: [http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/03/Nov03/112803/81n-0033p-c000016-01-vol84.pdf PDF file]) to the United States Food and Drug Administration that then-proposed rules for levels of sanguinarine in mouthwash and dental wash products were lower than necessary.  Professor George T. Gallagher also commented from his post at Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine, see his memorandum[http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dailys/03/jul03/070303/81N-0033P_emc-000001.txt] of 23 June 2003.

''[http://www.phytobiotics.com/Englisch/Products/sangrovit_e.htm Sangrovit®]'' is an animal food additive sold and distributed in Europe.  Sangrovit is manufactured by Germany-based Phytobiotics.  Sangrovit contains sanguinarine and chelerythrine.  On 14 May 2003, Cat Holmes reported in the Georgia Faces&lt;ref&gt;http://georgiafaces.caes.uga.edu/getstory.cfm?storyid=1851&lt;/ref&gt; that Jim Affolter and Selima Campbell, horticulturists at the University of Georgia College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, were meeting with Phytobiotics to relate their research into commercial cultivation of bloodroot.

==Historical uses==

The plant was used as a dye and for an herbal remedy by the native population. A break in the surface of the plant, especially the roots, reveals a reddish sap.

In physician William Cook's 1869 work '''The Physiomedical Dispensatory''' is recorded a chapter on the uses and preparations of bloodroot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.henriettesherbal.com/eclectic/cook/SANGUINARIA_CANADENSIS.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Cook described tinctures and extractions, and also included at least the following cautionary reference:
{{cquote|The U. S. Dispensatory says four persons lost their lives at Bellevue Hospital, New York, by drinking largely of blood root tincture in mistake for ardent spirits [...]}}
Greater Celandine (''[[../Chelidonium majus/]]''), a member of the poppy family (Papaveraceae) which has, like bloodroot, a caustic, reddish sap, was used in Colonial America as a wart remedy.  Bloodroot has been similarly applied in the past.  This may explain the multiple American and British definitions of &quot;Tetterwort&quot; in 1913.

'''Lilacs''' (''Syringa'') are a genus of about 20 species of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae (olive), native to Europe and Asia. The genus name Syringa is derived from syrinx meaning a hollow tube or pipe, and refers to the hollow state of the younger shoots in some species. The name &quot;pipe tree&quot; is occasionally used.

==Description==
Lilacs range in size from large shrubs to small trees, 2-10 m tall. The leaves are opposite (occasionally in whorls of three), deciduous, and in most species simple and heart-shaped, but pinnate in a few species (e.g. ''S. laciniata, S. pinnatifolia''). The flowers are produced in spring, each flower about 1 cm diameter, white, pale pink or more generally purple, with four petals. The flowers grow in large panicles, and in several species have a strong fragrance. Flowering starts after 80-110 growing degree days.

==Growing conditions==
&lt;!--sun, soil, etc.--&gt;

==Species==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
Lilacs are popular shrubs in parks and gardens throughout the temperate zone. In addition to the species listed above, several hybrids and numerous cultivars have been developed. The term French lilac is often used to refer to modern double-flowered cultivars, thanks to the work of prolific breeder Victor Lemoine.

The wood of lilac is close-grained, diffuse-porous, extremely hard and one of the densest in Europe. The sapwood is typically cream-coloured and the heartwood has various shades of brown and purple. Lilac wood has traditionally been used for engraving, musical instruments, knife handles etc. When drying the wood has a tendency to be encurved as a twisted material, and to split into narrow sticks. The wood of Common Lilac is even harder than for example that of Syringa josikaea.

Purple lilacs symbolise first love and white lilacs youthful innocence.

==Maintenance==
[[Image:Lilac cultivar.jpg|left|thumb|Lilac in flower (a white flowered cultivar]]
Lilacs flower on old wood, and produce more flowers if unpruned. If pruned, the plant responds by producing fast-growing young vegetative growth with no flowers, in an attempt to restore the removed branches; a pruned lilac often produces few or no flowers for one to five or more years, before the new growth matures sufficiently to start flowering. Unpruned lilacs flower reliably every year. Despite this, a common fallacy holds that lilacs should be pruned regularly. If pruning is required, it should be done right after flowering is finished, before next year's flower buds are formed. Lilacs generally grow better in slightly alkaline soil.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''I KEEP six honest serving-men''

''(They taught me all I know);''

''Their names are '''What and Why and When'''''

''And '''How and Where and Who'''''.

''I send them over land and sea,''

''I send them east and west;''

''But after they have worked for me,''

''I give them all a rest.''

a quote from ''The Elephant's Child '' by Rudyard Kipling, to which one could reasonably add What, Which, How many and so on- the sheer complexity of reasoning using only seven most important questions could be formulated as a sort of equation: 

7QnMQ/x

7 Questions: Who and What, When and Where, How and Why, and Which.

To the power of n: Who else, What else, When else, Where else, How else, Why else, Which else.

Multiplied by Meta Questions focused on the answers obtained at the 7Qn stage directing attention to function, structure, process, form, content, context, purpose, design.

Divided by x in terms of a possibility versus probability decision. The possibilities seem endless, So how should we start to find out what is possibly our best option?

==Organizing Information (Deduction)==
Humans are both hunters and gatherers. In fact in order to hunt, one has first to gather information about prey, terrain, available skills and so on then assemble a team, equip them with weapons, produce an overall strategy, and practice som tactical maneuvers. 
===Inventory===
This word comes from the past participle of ''invenire''  which means 'to find'. An inventory is simply a list of things found in a particular location such as a territory of store. The most famous inventory is the Doomsday Book compiled by William I shortly after conquering England. Useful as inventories may be for accounting purposes (Doomsday was a taxation project) they really need to be broken into sections.
===Index===
One of the great problems of medieval monasteries were that although they were centers of learning and filled with books, they were valuable and had to be chained to the lectern. So some clever monk got round to numbering all the pages as well as the chapters and verses, and then made a list of relevant passages for each topic - God's and Hebrews' actions, speeches and so on, and those were eventually developed into a concordance, which is a matrix rather like a modern worksheet or spreadsheet such as XL or Visicalc. Sophisticated database management systems  such as Microsoft Access or Oracle are really multi-directional spreadsheets in which the data is not merely stored processed and organized, it can be also retrieved in part or in whol and in several different ways
==Solution of Problems==
There are no problems, only opportunities to resolve difficulties in an interesting way!
===Given or Problem Statement ===
This obvious first step is often ignored, and as a result folk solve problems that do not actually exist, or else re-invent the wheel. As well as stating the problem, a well written problem statement will also outline similar and related problems, and any known solutions.
===Wanted or Solution Concept===
If you want to get to there, I would not start from here, if I were you! Imagine if you are lost in a country lane, perhaps finding a main road, which might lead to an intersection, a signpost, and intermediate point and finally..... A solution concept is just that. You may wish to go to the capital city to see a minister of state, but you will probably need to negotiate several lesser problems first.
===Experimentation Development and Implementation===
Nothing is ever simple - it may sound so, but in practice we encounter the Murphy principle: Things are apt go wrong only when it is vital that they should work perfectly! Practice does tend to make perfect - compare a modern production car to a Ford model &quot;T&quot;
The difference is quite minimal - both have four wheels, four seats, an engine.... So which is better, and why?
==Resolution of Controversies==
Wherever three people gather to discuss, there are always at least four different opinions!
===Competitive===
Trial of strength is the only option for most animals, and has remained in use throughout human history, only now it is called 'bullying', 'terrorism' or 'warfare'. Divine intervention, morality or justice may be invoked as a reasonable cause for violence, but to discover the real reason , do as &quot;Deep Throat&quot; suggested &quot;Follow the money. always follow the money.&quot;
===Contention===
The parties to a dispute ask an impartial and skilled judge to determine the solution, sometimes with the aid of experts (usually two, hence tribunal) and sometimes with a jury of the litigants' peers. There is an expression in english law, which roughly translated means &quot;the lawyer with the longest wig (experience) is the most expensive, which is why the litigant with the deepest pockets always wins&quot;
===Arbitration===
This is similar to contention, except that there is usually a prior contract, in which the parties have previously selected and agreed on a person or organization to resolve any future difficulties that they may encounter. This has the advantage that the trade or profession is more likely to avoid damage than the people or companies in dispute, so they are much more likely to try to settle by some other means such as private treaty (which is often a supplementary contract) or mediation.
===Mediation===
This is, legally speaking, the new kid on the block, and many jurisdictions insist the parties try it before going for a formal trial. The problem is that it requires both parties to forgive each other and really talk. 

The most common form is 'co-mediation' in which two neutral people sit between the contestants around a table, and 're-frame' their statements so that &quot;You blithering idiot&quot; becomes &quot;Your opponent has formed an opinion of you in which your actions may be inappropriate and ineffectual, so I will ask that you choose and describe a specific event&quot; 

Engaging in mediation requires maturity - there is no 'father figure' providing guidance, and humility since we all make mistakes, and, perhaps most of all, courage to try unusual, counter-intuitive ideas. 

Example: some residents of an apartment block were in dispute - one was accused of being a peeping tom (spying on his neighbors). After some hours and bitter tears, it emerged that he was neither a voyeur nor a thief, but was unemployed and searching through discarded rubbish to find food or things to sell. He was eventually elected as janitor or concierge at minimum wage. A year later, when the police-sponsored mediation service verified its results, he was a respected member of the community who had considerably supplemented his income by performing minor services for the other residents and nearby neighbors (the supervising police officer had merely had the awkward task of persuading him to make a reasonable tax declaration about his 'tips').

==Discovery of Truth==
The answer to Life, the Universe and Everything is precisely 42 - At least according to the Hitchhikers Guide to the Universe by Richard Adams, who wrote a story in which civilization collapses trying to discover &quot;Why was the answer 42?&quot;

There is a difference between wisdom and learning, and people who have little formal education are often more reasonable that scholars - which is reflected in the modern academic usage of an idea originating from wise King Solomon's song as ''living in ivory towers''. 
===Religion===
Religion probably has survival value, in that it mediates how co-religionists relate to each other and to outsiders. Unfortunately it is also quite effective at warfare since it is used by the great and powerful to manipulate the poor and the weak so that they organize armies and kill each other. For this reason, conservative theologians tend to denigrate liberal ideas like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Religion is a model of society that resembles a family or tribe. Ancestor worship assumes predecessors were more skilled than their pupils or students. Monotheism assumes a supreme entity similar to a remote father or tribal chief, while polytheism personifies skills as various gods and goddesses such as Fortune, who holds a cornucopia or cup of plenty in one hand, and a rudder behind her back, enabling her to alter the course of human life.

According to religious concepts, wisdom is handed down from generation to generation. The advent of writing some eight thousand years ago created permanent records that became unchallengeable 'scripture' from which emerged concepts of ubiquitousness and infallibility and hegemony when texts were interpreted by suitably appointed scholars and ordained priests.
====How religion can be used or misused ====
The earliest example of the power of writing is by the Babylonian King Hammurabi  dating back almost 4000 years to about 1772 BCE. His code is the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world, and was inscribed on stone stelae (pillars). Putting up a notice known as 'flying a kite' is still a good way of publishing your ideas, but today newspapers and blogs might be rather less expensive. like Hammurabi, be sure to sign your work and quote your authority. Anonymous ranting is fine for 'poison pens' but these are easily dismissed and rarely have any lasting effect.

From that sort of 'secondary scripture' writing down new ideas carrying references to 'divine revelation' (by chapter and verse) emerges the recent but persuasive dogma of 'intelligent creationism' in which all things have meaning and reason, only some of which are divinely revealed 'for the good of humanity' via holy scripture and others (like intelligent creationism) the 'people of God' (religiously inspired folk) have to divine for themselves from authoritative prior work. One of the earliest examples of this genre was by Archbishop James Ussher, who used scripture to establish the time and date of the creation as the night preceding Sunday, 23 October 4004 BCE.

===Science===
Science is also a belief system, but based on the idea of 'falsification'. Unlike Religion, which is divine revelation and so unquestionable, science demands that every assertion IS put into question. There are no facts, only 'best guesses' and techniques that work (technology) and ingenious ideas (engineering) that expand the sum of human wisdom.

Science is based in the concept of society being a chaotic collection of individuals with a variety of skills rather than a close-knit family. It relies on high communication skills and volumes, and emerged from the massive expansion of knowledge made possible by the high volume of written texts printed on Gutenberg presses from the fifteenth century and much increased after the invention of rotary printing in the nineteenth century. 

During the twentieth century telephony, radio, television and the Internet have greatly accelerated this 'global view' that all mankind both men and women, master and servant, rich and poor are equal. This 'flexible network' concept is in contrast to the rigid hierarchical structure of religious and commercial entities, and challenges the meritocratic hierarchy of academia, since students can, and routinely do outperform their teachers and publicly challenge their professors (whereas in religious parlance such rebellious acts might be punished as blasphemy against divine revelation).
====How science can be used or misused====
Like religion, science too uses earlier authoritative works to support ideas. But there is a difference: as well as quoting sources of inspiration and references to the work of others, science uses the principle of 'statistical probability' and 'repeatability' (same experiment by other independent researchers). 

There can be no absolute truths for science, no divine revelation - although some things are so well established as to seem incontrovertible, scientifically speaking, new understanding may always uproot previously 'proved' notions. The controversy about global warming is an example of human scientists falling prey to vested interests and clouding the reality with convenient opinions (environmentalists and oil magnates) dressed up to look like both good  science and scientific fraud (by misuse of statistics and propaganda by both sides).
 
Science, like religion, also has a theory of creation called 'evolution' in which simple things become more complicated. At the core is a belief that matter and energy are essentially the same (so burning wood releases energy previously stored from the sun using photosynthesis). The start of the universe was a singularity that broke down (all creation was energy free dark matter that exploded in the big-bang, and living organisms are accidental chemical reactions, so life has no divine meaning, and reason is merely a consequence of biological  complexity.

===Apologists===
Many scientists hold religious or unscientific beliefs. Issac Newton was an alchemist who was really  trying to turn base metal into gold - a feat that was finally made possible by nuclear science based on the theories of   Albert Einstein, an agnostic who nevertheless believed in something marvelous approaching Buddhism.

In reality, we humans tend to evolve fictional stories for and about ourselves which reconcile our various irreconcilable beliefs. Religion addresses our emotional feelings, science our rationality. We have both: quick and dirty short term love and hatred, long term rational planning and dogged implementation. We need both! 

One might reasonably believe that a merciful god would see a poor naked farmer sowing seed and bless his harvest. In fact, one is unlikely to remain entirely unclothed and unshod for very long if the ground is baked hard, or soaking wet or mostly stony, nor if the sun is hot, or if it is raining wind nor during strong winds. Now guess what science thinks might be the ideal conditions for seed germination? We can, therefor benefit from both emotional and rational stories.

Mostly our balance of emotion and  reason has us make the right decisions, sometimes  for the wrong reasons - and sometimes vice versa!

==Performance==
I'd strongly recommend replacing this with something that doesn't have to load a large list of pages in background JavaScript; it causes unnecessary slowdowns. It may be possible to do some decent random selection via the MediaWiki API; if not already available, it would not be difficult to add a module to provide it, which can then be queried JS much more efficiently (and function when JS is not available!) --[[User:Brion VIBBER|Brion VIBBER]] ([[User talk:Brion VIBBER|talk]]) 23:37, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

:First test version of an API/JS module: [[User:Splarka/randbook.js]] (it queries generator=random with limit=10 (max) repeatedly until it finds a page in the book categories). This works because 10.5% of the articles on en.wb are main book pages.
:Another option would be to use [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;generator=categorymembers&amp;gcmlimit=100&amp;gcmnamespace=14&amp;gcmtitle=Category:Alphabetical&amp;prop=categoryinfo generator=categorymembers&amp;prop=categoryinfo] on Category:Alphabetical, to find all 38 categories, and weight them by the number of members, and then randomly choose one, grab the full list, and randomly select a member (~500 at most currently, but not scaleable).
:Ideally would be [[bugzilla:2170|2170 Random page in this category feature]] (marked as fixed but actually broken/reverted again), but that would require a schema change to add cl_random for efficiency purposes. Or just be broken on big categories. [[User:Splarka|Splarka]] ([[User talk:Splarka|talk]]) 09:31, 13 November 2008 (UTC)

== Bug? ==

Hi!

When I go to [[MediaWiki:Perbook/X86 Disassembly.css]] it is shown the following links in the tabs: _|[[Special:Mypage/per book/MediaWiki:Perbook.css|style]]|_ and _|[[Special:Mypage/per book/MediaWiki:Perbook.js|script]]|_. There, I another tab with the link _|book|_ that points to &quot;MediaWiki:Perbook&quot;, that doesn't exist, instead of point to the original [[MediaWiki:Perbook/X86 Disassembly.css]]. What is wrong? [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]]19:14, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

Hi!

[[MediaWiki:Common.js/Toolbox.js|This script]] is causing an error when a user opens a page like [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.js/Toolbox.js&amp;action=edit this] (which is not editable for non-admins):
 edit.wikiEditor is not a function
 https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Common.js/Toolbox.js&amp;action=raw&amp;ctype=text/javascript

It seems to be enought to test if &lt;code&gt;edit.wikiEditor&lt;/code&gt; is defined and, if not, just return.

:Uops... I forgot to mention that on pt.wb we had changed the variable name from &quot;edit&quot; to &quot;$edit&quot; (since it's value is get with $(...), this makes it clearer), so you'll need to do another edit to either change the &quot;$edit&quot; [http://en.wikibooks.org/?diff=prev&amp;oldid=2055750 added here] to &quot;edit&quot; or change all other 3 &quot;edit&quot;s to &quot;$edit&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section of the Spanish wikibook discusses the Spanish past tense.  You have presumably learned about the present tense, therefore this section assumes a knowledge of said tense and previously learned vocabulary. 

='''''La formación del pretérito'''''=

The preterite is used to speak of an event that happened at a specific time (I went to Sallly's (yesterday)).
First, we must learn the preterite tense, is used for past actions that are seen as completed. There are two different forms of the preterite, one for -ar verbs and a seperate form for -er and -ir verbs.  



'''''1.  Los verbos regulares del preterito - ar'''''


Let us learn the conjugation for regular -ar verbs in the preterite now.  For example:


; El preterito - ejemplos de los verbos ''-ar''
{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | cantar (to sing)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''é'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''amos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''aste'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''asteis''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''ó'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''aron'''
|}


{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | nadar (to swim)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | nad'''é'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | nad'''amos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | nad'''aste'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | nad'''asteis''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | nad'''ó'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | nad'''aron'''
|}

Notice the pattern: in each form, you must drop the &quot;ar&quot; in the infinitive form.  For the first person singular, you add &quot;é&quot;, for the second person singular you add &quot;aste&quot;, for the third it is &quot;aron&quot;.  As for plural, in the first person &quot;amos&quot; is added, in the second &quot;asteis&quot;, and in the third we add &quot;aron&quot;. 
 
On to the exercises...



'''''2. Los verbos regulares del preterito - er y ir'''''


Now, we will learn the conjugation for regular -er and -ir verbs.  For example:


; El preterito - ejemplos de los verbos ''-er'' y ''-ir''
{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | beber (to drink)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | beb'''í'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | beb'''imos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | beb'''iste'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | beb'''isteis''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | beb'''ió'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | beb'''ieron'''
|}


{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | vivir (to live)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | viv'''í'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | viv'''imos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | viv'''iste'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | viv'''isteis''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | viv'''ió'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | viv'''ieron'''


|}

Notice the pattern: in each form, you must drop the &quot;er&quot; or &quot;ir&quot; in the infinitive form.  For the first person singular, you add &quot;í&quot;, for the second person singular you add &quot;iste&quot;, for the third it is &quot;ieron&quot;.  As for plural, in the first person &quot;imos&quot; is added, in the second &quot;isteis&quot;, and in the third we add &quot;ieron&quot;.  

On to the exercises...


'''''3. Los verbos con cambios de deletreo en la forma &quot;yo&quot; - 'car', 'gar', 'zar''''''

There are also verbs that have a spelling change in the first person singular form. These changes occur in verbs that end in &quot;car&quot;, &quot;gar&quot;, or &quot;zar&quot; and, in the first two cases, are necessary in order to maintain the original sound of the written verb (in speaking, we tend to pronounce the word correctly without having to think about it). 

As explained in the &quot;Alfabeto&quot; section, both &quot;c&quot; and &quot;g&quot; have a 'hard' sound before an &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, and a soft sound before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;. In the first-person Preterite, then, the &quot;é&quot; ending would change the 'k/' sound of the &quot;c&quot; to an 's/' sound, and the hard-g sound to a 'h/' sound.  In order to maintain the original sound of the verb, we change the spelling.  For a &quot;-car&quot; verb, we change the &quot;c&quot; to a &quot;qu&quot; when it comes before &quot;é&quot;:


{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | practi''car'' (to practice)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | practi'''qué'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | practic'''amos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | practic'''aste'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | practic'''asteis''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | practic'''ó'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | practic'''aron'''
|}


Similarly, for a &quot;-gar&quot; verb, we add a &quot;u&quot; after the &quot;g&quot;:


{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | lle''gar'' (to arrive)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | lle'''gué'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | lleg'''amos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | lleg'''aste'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | lleg'''asteis''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | lleg'''ó'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | lleg'''aron'''
|}


For &quot;-zar&quot; verbs, there is no longer a change in pronunciation, but tradition calls for the letter &quot;z&quot; to be followed only by &quot;a&quot;, &quot;o&quot; or &quot;u&quot;.  With a following &quot;e&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, we change the &quot;z&quot; to a &quot;c&quot;:


{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | comen''zar'' (to begin)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | comen'''cé'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | comenz'''amos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | comenz'''aste'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | comenz'''asteis''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | comenz'''ó'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | comenz'''aron'''
|}


On to the exercises...


'''''Ejercicios del pretérito'''''

These exercises take what we have learned so far and integrate everything together.  Be familiar with the first three sections of el tiempo pasado.

On to the exercises...

='''''La formación del imperfecto'''''=

The imperfect tense is used to refer to actions in the past that occurred repeatedly.  E.g. I used to play with dolls.  These have an indefinite time.  It's often used to describe past behaviours and likes, especially of childhood.

'''''1.  La formacion del imperfecto - los verbos ar'''''

Just as with the preterite, in the imperfect construction -ar verbs receive their own conjugation.  For example:

; El preterito - ejemplos de los verbos ''-ar''
{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | hablar (to speak)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | habl'''aba'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | habl'''ábamos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | habl'''abas'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | habl'''abais''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | habl'''aba'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | habl'''aban'''
|}


{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | cantar (to sing)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''aba'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''ábamos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''abas'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''abais''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''aba'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | cant'''aban'''
|}

Notice the pattern: in the imperfect construction we drop the &quot;ar&quot; and add our endings.  As for the singular, in the first person we add &quot;aba&quot;, in the second person we add &quot;abas&quot;, and in the third person we add &quot;aba&quot;.  In the plural, for the first person we add &quot;ábamos&quot; (with an accent), for the second person we add &quot;abais&quot;, and in the third we add &quot;aban&quot;. 

Onto the exercises...


'''''2.  La formacion del imperfecto - los verbos er y ir'''''


Just as in the preterite, the -er and -ir verbs have their own conjugation.  For example:

; El preterito - ejemplos de los verbos ''-er'' y ''-ir''
{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | correr (to run)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | corr'''ía'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | corr'''íamos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | corr'''ías'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | corr'''íais''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | corr'''ía'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | corr'''ían'''
|}


{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | asistir (to attend)
|-
|
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Singular'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Plural'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''First'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | asist'''ía'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | asist'''íamos'''
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Second'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | asist'''ías'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | asist'''íais''' 
|-
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | '''Third'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | asist'''ía'''
| style=&quot;background:#ffffff&quot; | asist'''ían'''
|}


Notice the pattern: in the imperfect construction we drop the &quot;er&quot; or &quot;ir&quot; and add our endings.  As for the singular, in the first person we add &quot;ía&quot;, in the second person we add &quot;ías&quot;, and in the third person we add &quot;ía&quot;.  In the plural, for the first person we add &quot;íamos&quot; (with an accent), for the second person we add &quot;íais&quot;, and in the third we add &quot;ían&quot;. 

Onto the exercises...


'''''3.  Los verbos irregulares en la forma de imperfecto: 'ser', 'ir', y 'ver''''''


Only three verbs are irregular in the imperfect construction: ''ser'', ''ir'', and ''ver'':

{| style=&quot;background:#bbeebb&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Oedipus was a king of Thebes. When he was born there was a prophecy that he would murder his father and marry his mother. Because of this, his parents had a soldier carry him away to kill him. However, the soldier couldn't go through with it and instead gave him to a farmer to raise as his own. 

Years later, when Oedipus was grown, Thebes was being plagued by the sphinx, who would wait by the roadside and ask every passerby a riddle and when they couldn't answer correctly they would be killed. Oedipus came to Thebes to try his luck at the riddle, but on the way he met a traveler, got into an argument and killed him. The traveler was his father, the king, who had been going to try and find help against the sphinx.

When Oedipus arrived at Thebes he was questioned by the sphinx, but was successful in answering the riddle, and the sphinx in disgrace killed herself. In gratitude for freeing them the people of Thebes made Oedipus their king, to replace the one who had not come back, and Oedipus married the queen, who was really his mother.

It was not until much later that the truth of who Oedipus really was, was revealed. In horror at what he had done he gouged out his own eyes, and wandered the rest of his days.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Needs to be cleared up?===

While I'm not exactly certain about it all myself, isn't it a bit incorrect to call this part quicktime? Quicktime is a framework for showing video and playing audio in OS X, the player is just a frontend. (Which is still called QuickTime Player when you have the pro version). It would probably be smarter to rename this part QuickTime Player and let people know that what plays videos and music in iTunes is quicktime as well, just not QuickTime Player.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)'''is a method of gel elctrophoresis to separate proteins based on the their mass.The proteins are dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),a detergent that breaks up the interactions between proteins,and then electrophorised. The smallest molecules move through the gel faster, while larger molecules take longer and result in bands closer to the top of the gel.

===Gel===
The gel used for SDS-PAGE is made out of acrylamide which form cross-linked polymers of polyacrylamide. Standard gels are typically composed of two layers, one top-most layer called the stacking gel and a lower layer called separating or resolving gel.The stacking layer contains a low percentage of acylamide and has low pH , while the acrylamide concentration of the separating gel varies according to the samples to be run and has higher pH.The difference in pH and acrylamide concentration at the stacking and separating gel provides better resolution and sharper bands in the separating gel.

===Procedure===
The samples are treated with SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate),an anionic detergent which denatures  the protein by breaking the disulfide bonds and gives negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass.Without SDS,different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in folding,as differences in folding patterns would cause some proteins to better fit through the gel matrix than others.SDS linearizes the proteins so that they may be separated strictly by molecular weight.The SDS binds to the protein in a ratio of approximately 1.4 g SDS per 1.0 g protein [[http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/protocols/html/SDS_PAGE_protocol.htm]],giving an approximately uniform mass:charge ratio for most proteins,so that the distance of migration through the gel can be assumed to be directly related to only the size of the protein.Proteins may be further treated with reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol(DTT) or TRP(Tributyl phosphine)to break any reformed disulfide bonds and then alkalated with iodoacetamide to prevent reformation of disulfide bonds.
A tracking dye like bromophenol blue may be added to the protein solution to track the progress of the protein solution through the gel during the electrophoretic run.

===Electrophoresis===
The proteins denatured by SDS are applied to one end of a layer of polyacrylamide gel submerged in a buffer.Buffer provide uniform pH and ions for conducting electric potential. When an electric current is applied across the gel,the negatively-charged proteins migrate across the gel to the positive pole. Short proteins will more easily fit through the pores in the gel and move fast, while larger ones will have more difficulty.Due to differential migration based on their size, smaller proteins move farther down the gel, while larger ones stay closer to the point of origin.After a given period of time,proteins might have separated roughly according to their sizes.Proteins of known molecular weight (marker proteins)can be run in a separate lane in the gel to calibrate the gel.

===Staining and analysis===

Following electrophoresis,the gel may be stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain to visualize the separated proteins. After staining, different proteins will appear as distinct bands within the gel according to their sizes and thus by molecular weights. The molecular weight of a protein in the band can be estimated by comparing it with the marker proteins of known molecular weights. The separatesd protens can be cut from the gel and further analyzed by other proteomic techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is where you decide how your computer should boot. The amount of options depend on your setup and most users will have only one choice, the OS X system on the internal harddrive. Other potential options are to boot from an official OS X disc (either one of the discs you got with the computer or the CDs you get if you buy OS X) or to boot from a BootCamp partition. It's also possible to have an extra OS X on an external harddrive and boot from that one. It's even possible to boot from a volume on a network.

This preference pane is very easy to use. Click the volume you want to have as start disk and press the Restart... button. The computer will restart and boot from the system you picked.

This is also where you restart in Target Disk Mode to be able to use the computer as an external harddrive (only works with FireWire).

      <text xml:space="preserve">2D-PAGE is a form of gel electrophoresis  in which separation and identification of proteins in a sample are done by displacement in 2 dimensions oriented at right angles to one another(orthogonal). This technique is also used to compare two or more samples to find differences in their protein expressions.

===Basis for separation===

In this technique proteins are separated by two different physicochemical properties. In the first dimension proteins or polypeptides are separated on the basis of their net charges by isoelectric focusing and in the second dimension they are separated on the basis of their molecular masses by electrophoresis. Because it is unlikely that two molecules will be similar in both properties, molecules are more effectively separated in 2-D electrophoresis than in 1-D electrophoresis.

===Sample preparation===

The goal of sample preparation is to solubilize maximum number of proteins and maintain their solubility throughout the process. The materials for sample should be carefully collected, snap frozen and ground under liquid nitrogen in the presence of protease inhibitors. After extracting proteins from source material they are then solubilized and denatured by means of chaotropes, detergents, and reducing agents. Hydrogen-bonds in the sample proteins are disrupted by chaotropes urea and thiourea. Uncharged detergents are used to disrupt hydrophobic interactions. Detergents such as CHAPS, Triton X-100, sulfobetaine SB3-10, and amidosulfobetaine  are IEF-compatible additives. Disulfide bonds 
are reduced to sulfhydryls by reducing agents dithiothrietol (DTT), dithioerythritol, and tributyl phosphine (TBP). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sequential extraction is done to categorize proteins based on their solubility. This is an example of pre-fractionation to enrich low abundance proteins. Proteins are sequentially extracted into chaotrope/detergent solutions of increasing solubilization power. First, proteins are treated with an aqueous buffer, the insoluble proteins remaining from this extraction are treated with urea/CHAPS/TBP, and the insoluble proteins remaining from this step are then treated with urea/thiourea/CHAPS/SB 3-10/TBP.  2-D PAGE is then done to separate the proteins in each of the supernatants. The remaining insoluble material from the final extraction can be taken up in SDS-PAGE sample solution and run in a one-dimensional gel.

===Isoelectric focusing (IEF)===
In IEF, proteins are separated by electrophoresis in a pH gradient based on their isoelectric point(pl). A pH gradient is generated in the gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel. At all pHs other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged. If they are positively charged, they will move towards the more negative end of the gel and if they are negatively charged they will move towards the more positive end of the gel. At its isoelectric point, since the protein molecule carry no net charge it accumulates or focuses into a sharp band.

=====Immobilized pH Gradient (IPG) and IEF run=====
Immobilized pH gradients are used for IEF because the fixed pH gradients remain stable over extended run times at very high voltages. The pH gradients of IPGs are generated by means of buffering compounds that are covalently bound into polyacrylamide gels. IPGs are cast strips with plastic backing sheets and are commercially available in different pH ranges and lengths. They offer high resolution, great reproducibility, and allow high protein loads. Isoelectric focusing is run in the same solutions that are used to extract or solubalize the proteins. The IPG strips with the protein sample must be rehydrated in the rehydration/sample buffer during with protein samples are loaded into the strips. Rehydration can be active or passive. To load larger proteins active rehydration in small voltage is applied. After the run in IEF cell, the proteins focus as bands on the strip according to their isoelectric points. The focused strips can be frozen for storage

===SDS-PAGE===
=====IPG gel strips equilibration=====
The proteins in the focussed IPG strips are uncharged because they are at their pI and so they will not move into the SDS- PAGE gel. So the strips are treated with SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), an anionic detergent which denatures  the protein by breaking the disulfide bonds and gives negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass. Without SDS, different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in folding, as differences in folding patterns would cause some proteins to better fit through the gel matrix than others. SDS  linearizes the proteins so that they may be separated strictly by molecular weight. The SDS binds to the protein in a ratio of approximately 1.4 g SDS per 1.0 g protein (although binding ratios can vary from 1.1-2.2 g SDS/g protein), giving an approximately uniform mass:charge ratio for most proteins, so that the distance of migration through the gel can be assumed to be directly related to only the size of the protein. 
Proteins may be further treated with reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or TRP(Tributyl phosphine to break any reformed disulfide bonds and then alkalated with iodoacetamide to prevent reformation of disulfide bonds. A tracking dye like bromophenol blue may be added to the protein solution to track the progress of the protein solution through the gel during the electrophoretic run.

=====SDS-PAGE run=====
The equlibrated IPG strip is placed on the top of the SDS-PAGE gel  submerged in a suitable buffer and sealed in place with agarose gel. An electric current is applied across the gel, causing the negatively-charged proteins move out of the gel and migrate across the gel. Depending on their size, each protein  move differently through the gel matrix. Smaller proteins travel farther down the gel, while larger ones remain closer to the point of origin. The proteins separate roughly according to size and therefore by molecular weight. It is common to run &quot;marker proteins&quot; of known molecular weight in a separate lane in the gel, in order to calibrate the gel and determine the weight of unknown proteins by comparing the distance traveled relative to the marker.

===Visualization===
After electrophoresis the gel is stained to visualize the separated proteins. Commonly used stains are Coomassie Brilliant Blue or SYPRO Ruby or silver stain. different proteins will appear as distinct spot within the gel. Coomassie Brilliant Blue or SYPRO Ruby are compatible with Mass Spectrometry. Coomassie Brilliant Blue has detection limit about 10ng of proteins per spot and the gel images of spots can be captured by scanning densitometer which operate in visible light[[http://www.weihenstephan.de/blm/deg/manual/manualwork2html02test.htm]]. SYPRO Ruby can detect 1ng of proteins per spot and since it is fluorescent , the sopts are visualized by a fluorescent imager. Silver stain can detect spots containing proteins less than 1 ng and is the most sensitive non – radioactive protein visualization method.Laser devices for image capturing are useful for fluorescently stained gels.
[[Image:2D-PAGE.JPG|frame|Image of the gel after 2D-PAGE run]]

===Analysis===
The images can be further analyzed using image –analysis softwares. These softwares quantify proteins spots, match images and compare corresponding spots intensites of related gels, prepare gel data reports, remove background patterns, and integrate image information to databases.Alternately the proteins separated can be obtained from the gel can be analyzed by MS for protein identification. 2D- PAGE can be used to study diffrential protein expression by comparing images from  2D –PAGE gels samples labeled with stable isotopes or fluorescent dyes.

===Advantages and Disadvantages===
Using 2D-PAGE,100 –1000’s of polypeptides can be analyzed in a single run. The proteins can be separated in pure form from the spots. The spots can be quantified and also analyzed by MS. In this method polypeptides can be probed with antibodies and also 
they can be tested for post- translational modifications. The disadvantages may include large amount of sample handling, less reproducibility, difficulty to separate low abundance proteins, acidic and basic proteins, very large and very small proteins and hydrophobic proteins.Also not automated for high throughput analysis.2D-PAGE has limited dynamic range.

==Theory==
Differential in Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) is a technique to monitor the differences in proteomic profile between cells in different functional states. This is done in three steps. First, samples are tagged with unique fluorescent dyes. Second, they are run together on the same 2D-PAGE gel. Finally, after the run completes, the different fluorescent images of the same gel are superimposed over each other. DIGE allows the study of proteins that are expressed differentially, as well as those that are common between samples. This technology allows for simultaneous separation and comparison of up to three samples on one gel.{{ref|Unlu}}

==DIGE vs. 2D-PAGE==
In traditional 2D-PAGE, different samples are often separated in multiple gels. Those gels are then overlapped to compare one gel to another. Due to differences between gels in spatial resolution and spot intensities, the overlaying of images and correct matching of proteins is difficult. There can also be variations in protein uptake by the isoelectric focusing strips, incomplete protein transfer from the first to the second dimension gel, and local inconsistencies in gel composition, field strength or pH gradients. These gel-to-gel variations can mask the biological variation between the samples. Unfortunately, not all of these variations are avoidable; they can occur for a number of reasons. Thus, quantitative comparisons of protein expression levels are difficult using 2D-PAGE. 

In DIGE, protein mixtures are pre-labeled, prior to electrophoresis, with cyanine dyes that guarantee co-migration of proteins. This co-migration on the same gel eliminates running differences between samples. In addition, the samples are subjected to the same environment and the same procedures throughout the experiment. Experimental variation is minimized in this way. In DIGE, there is no need to process a gel for visualization after electrophoresis.

==Dyes==
The cyanine dyes (Cy2, Cy3 and Cy5) used for DIGE are N-hydroxy succinimidyl ester derivatives, are covalently tagged to the ε-amino group of lysine residue of proteins, and replace the ε-amino group positive charge with the positive charge of the dye. The binding of the dyes introduce small but matched increases in molecular weight to the protein. Since these dyes are hydrophobic, to prevent precipitation of proteins, only one lysine residue per protein is labeled (minimal labeling). Minimal labeling limits the fluorescence intensity and thus the sensitivity of the stain. The dyes are all charge-matched and molecular mass-matched to prevent alterations of the isoelectric point, and to minimize dye-induced shifting of labeled proteins during electrophoresis.{{ref|Attard}}

There is also another class of cyanine dyes, called saturation dyes, which saturate cysteine residues instead of minimally labeling lysine residues. Again, these dyes are mass and charge-matched; but there is a smaller chance of protein modification and isoelectric point shift. Saturation cysteine dyes have superior sensitivity to minimal lysine labeling. As with the minimal lysine labelling cyanine dyes, if a cysteine amino acid is not present in a protein, then the saturation dyes will not be able to label it, leaving the protein undetectable.

==Experiment== 
===Two dyes===
Two protein samples are first labeled with propyl-Cy3 and methyl-Cy5. Once the samples are labeled, they are applied onto a single 2D-GE gel. After the run, the corresponding protein spot are visualized by successively illuminating the gel with the excitation wavelengths of each of the dyes. The resulting protein spots are analyzed using imaging software. Differentially expressed protein spots are then excised from the gel and identified by mass spectrometry.

===Three dyes===
To study multiple samples, a large number of pairwise comparisons or analysis of samples run on different gels is needed. An important alternative is to use a third dye (Cy2) with similar characteristics as Cy3 and Cy5. Protein samples are labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5, and a pooled sample containing equal amounts of all samples in the experiment is labeled with Cy2. All samples are then applied on the same gel. The pooled sample acts as an internal standard for every protein spot on each of the gels, and is then used for normalization of all spots, across all gels. This approach reduces the experimental variation, increasing both the accuracy of quantification and the statistical confidence of protein expression differences.{{ref|Bergh}}

==Advantages==
To study differential expression of proteins, there is no need to run multiple gels. Loss of proteins even in the low molecular weight range is reduced since no post-electrophoretic processing (fixation or destaining) is necessary. This method is more quantitative than the standard colorimetric staining methods, both with regard to sensitivity as well as linearity.

__TOC__
==Theory==
Quantitative preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (QPNC-PAGE) is an electrophoresis technique to isolate native or active metalloproteins in biological samples and to resolve properly and improperly folded metal cofactor-containing proteins in complex protein mixtures. Some examples of metalloproteins are metal chaperones, prions, metal transport proteins, amyloids, metalloenzymes, and metallopeptides.

==Gel and Buffer Characteristics==
The gel is polymerized for a time period of sixty-nine hours at room temperature. That results in a gel which is mechanically stable, homogeneous, and free of monomers or radicals, and therefore, only negligible interactions of the gel with the biomolecules occurs. The metalloproteins are not dissociated into metal cofactors and apoproteins during electrophoresis, and purified metalloproteins are isolated in quantitative amounts from different PAGE fractions. Due to the specific characterstics of the gel, the conformation or active structures of the isolated proteins are not changed by this method.

The chemical stability of a specific metalloprotein can be investigated and confirmed by using molecular exclusion chromatography.

The buffer used for electrophoresis contains 20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM NaN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and has a pH 10. Due to the specific properties of the gel and buffer solution, most proteins in the sample are charged negatively and migrate from the cathode to the anode in the electric field. The proteins are eluted continuously by a physiological buffer solution and isolated in different fractions.{{ref|QPNC}}

==Analysis and Applications==
Metal cofactors eluted in different PAGE fractions can be identified and quantified by mass spectrometry. Since the pure metalloproteins are separated under non-denaturing conditions, the structures of these proteins can be obtained by solution NMR spectroscopy.

Improper folding of metalloproteins results in degenerative conditions like Alzheimer's disease. The quantitative analysis of metallochaperone proteins in biofluids helps in the clinical investigations concerning the structure-function relationships of biologically-active metal cofactor-containing chaperones in those protein-misfolding diseases.{{ref|ALZ}} QPNC-PAGE combined with biological mass and NMR spectrometries provides valuable information about the metabolisms of important metal cofactors in biological systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==='''Isoelectric Focusing(IEF)'''=== 
In Isoelectric focusing, proteins are separated by electrophoresis in a pH gradient based on their isoelectric point(pl). A pH gradient is generated in the gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel. At all pHs other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged. If they are positively charged, they will move towards the more negative end of the gel and if they are negatively charged they will move towards the more positive end of the gel. At its isoelectric point, since the protein molecule carry no net charge it accumulates or focuses into a sharp band.

===== Immobilized pH Gradeint (IPG) and IEF run=====
Immobilized pH gradients are used for IEF because the fixed pH gradients remain stable over extended run times at very high voltages. The pH gradients of IPGs are generated by means of buffering compounds that are covalently bound into polyacrylamide gels. IPGs are cast strips with plastic backing sheets and are commercially available in different pH ranges and lengths. They offer high resolution, great reproducibility, and allow high protein loads. Isoelectric focusing is run in the same solutions that are used to extract or solubalize the proteins. The IPG strips with the protein sample must be rehydrated in the rehydration/sample buffer during which protein samples are loaded into the strips. Rehydration can be active or passive. To load larger proteins active rehydration in small voltage is applied.As the sample is electrophorised, the proteins will migrate toward either the anode or cathode, depending on charge. The proteins will stop when they reach their respective pI. After the run in IEF cell, the proteins focus as bands on the strip according to their isoelectric points. The focused strips can be frozen for storage.

=='''Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)'''==
This is a very common method of gel elctrophoresis for separating proteins by mass. The most commonly used system is also called the Laemmli method after U.K. Laemmli, who was the first to publish a paper employing SDS-PAGE in a scientific study.The proteins are dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),a detergent that breaks up the interactions between proteins,and then electrophorised. The smallest molecules move through the gel faster, while larger molecules take longer and result in bands closer to the top of the gel.
[[image:SDS-PAGE.jpg|thumb|230px|Picture of an SDS-PAGE. The molecular marker is in the left lane]]

====Gel====
The gel used for SDS-PAGE is made out of acrylamide which form crooss-linked polymers of polyacrylamide. Standard gels are typically composed of two layers, one top-most layer called the stacking gel and a lower layer called separating or resolving gel.The stacking layer contains a low percentage of acylamide and has low pH , while the acrylamide concentration of the separating gel varies according to the samples to be run and has higher pH.The difference in pH and acrylamide concentration at the stacking and separating gel provides better resolution and sharper bands in the separating gel.

====Procedure====
The samples are treated with SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate),an anionic detergent which denatures  the protein by breaking the disulfide bonds and gives negative charge to each protein in proportion to its mass.Without SDS,different proteins with similar molecular weights would migrate differently due to differences in folding,as differences in folding patterns would cause some proteins to better fit through the gel matrix than others.SDS linearizes the proteins so that they may be separated strictly by molecular weight.The SDS binds to the protein in a ratio of approximately 1.4 g SDS per 1.0 g protein [[http://mullinslab.ucsf.edu/protocols/html/SDS_PAGE_protocol.htm]],giving an approximately uniform mass:charge ratio for most proteins,so that the distance of migration through the gel can be assumed to be directly related to only the size of the protein.Proteins may be further treated with reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol(DTT) or TRP(Tributyl phosphine)to break any reformed disulfide bonds and then alkalated with iodoacetamide to prevent reformation of disulfide bonds.
A tracking dye like bromophenol blue may be added to the protein solution to track the progress of the protein solution through the gel during the electrophoretic run.

====Electrophoresis====
The proteins denatured by SDS are applied to one end of a layer of polyacrylamide gel submerged in a buffer.Buffer provide uniform pH and ions for conducting electric potential. When an electric current is applied across the gel,the negatively-charged proteins migrate across the gel to the positive pole. Short proteins will more easily fit through the pores in the gel and move fast, while larger ones will have more difficulty.Due to differential migration based on their size, smaller proteins move farther down the gel, while larger ones stay closer to the point of origin.After a given period of time,proteins might have separated roughly according to their sizes.Proteins of known molecular weight (marker proteins)can be run in a separate lane in the gel to calibrate the gel.

====Staining and analysis====

Following electrophoresis,the gel may be stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain to visualize the separated proteins.After staining, different proteins will appear as distinct bands within the gel accroding to their sizes and thus by molecular weights.The molecular weight of a protein in the band can be estimated by comparing it with the marker proteins of known molecular weights.The separatesd protens can be cut from the gel and further analyzed by other proteomics techniques.

=='''Isoelectric Focusing(IEF)'''== 
In Isoelectric focusing, proteins are separated by electrophoresis in a pH gradient based on their isoelectric point(pl). A pH gradient is generated in the gel and an electric potential is applied across the gel. At all pHs other than their isoelectric point, proteins will be charged. If they are positively charged, they will move towards the more negative end of the gel and if they are negatively charged they will move towards the more positive end of the gel. At its isoelectric point, since the protein molecule carry no net charge it accumulates or focuses into a sharp band.


====Immobilized pH Gradeint (IPG) and IEF run====
Immobilized pH gradients are used for IEF because the fixed pH gradients remain stable over extended run times at very high voltages. The pH gradients of IPGs are generated by means of buffering compounds that are covalently bound into polyacrylamide gels. IPGs are cast strips with plastic backing sheets and are commercially available in different pH ranges and lengths. They offer high resolution, great reproducibility, and allow high protein loads. Isoelectric focusing is run in the same solutions that are used to extract or solubalize the proteins. The IPG strips with the protein sample must be rehydrated in the rehydration/sample buffer during which protein samples are loaded into the strips. Rehydration can be active or passive. To load larger proteins active rehydration in small voltage is applied.As the sample is electrophorised, the proteins will migrate toward either the anode or cathode, depending on charge. The proteins will stop when they reach their respective pI. After the run in IEF cell, the proteins focus as bands on the strip according to their isoelectric points. The focused strips can be frozen for storage.

=='''Native-PAGE'''==
Native PAGE is used to separate proteins in their native states according to difference in their charge density. Native state of protein means proteins are in properly folded state, not denatured or unfolded state. There are no denaturants present in the gel and buffer in the gel maintains the protein in its native state. Many proteins are shown to be enzymatically active after separation by native PAGE. Thus, it is used for prepartion of purified and active proteins.
In native PAGE the mobility depends on both the protein's charge and its hydrodynamic size. The charge depend on the amino acid composition of the protein as well as post-translational modifications. The hydrodynamic size and mobility of native protein on the gel will vary with the nature of the conformation. Proteins with compact conformations have higher mobility and larger structures like oligomers have lower mobility.
Native PAGE can be carried out near neutral pH to avoid acid or alkaline denaturation to study conformation as well as self-association or aggregation, and the binding of other proteins or compounds. The apparatus is kept cool to minimize denaturation of proteins and proteolysis.

==Theory==
Two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) is a form of gel electrophoresis in which proteins are separated and identified in two dimensions oriented at right angles to each other.

In this technique, proteins are separated by two different physical properties. The first dimension, isoelectric focusing, separates proteins on the basis of their net charge. The second dimension, SDS-PAGE, further separates the proteins by their mass. Small changes in charge and mass can easily be detected by this method, because it is rare that two different proteins will resolve to the same place in both dimensions.{{ref|Exp}}

For further details on gels, staining, and electrophoretic analysis, see the &quot;Gel Electrophoresis&quot; section of this chapter.
For further details on the individual dimensions of two dimensional electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE, see the &quot;One Dimensional Electrophoresis&quot; section of this chapter.

==Process==
The proteins in a focused IPG strip are uncharged (their net charge is 0) because they are at their isoelectric point, so they will not move into the SDS-PAGE gel. To prepare the proteins for movement into the SDS-PAGE gel, the equilibrated strip is treated with detergent SDS. The treated IPG strip is placed on top of the SDS-PAGE gel, submerged in a buffer, and sealed in place with agarose gel. When an electric current is applied across the layered gels, the negatively charged proteins move out of the IPG strip and migrate through the SDS-PAGE gel. Each protein moves differently through the gel matrix depending on its size. The separation of proteins is distributed roughly according to size (molecular weight), like other electrophoresis methods.{{ref|Garfin}}

[[Image:2D_electrophoresis.gif|center|A description of 2D electrophoresis.]]

==Visualization and Analysis==
The resolution of 2D-PAGE gels is somewhat different than that of one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Proteins are rarely resolved as discrete bands; rather, they are resolved as spots cascading down the gel. These gels can be stained in much the same way as other electrophoresis techniques, and adding another dimension of separation does not in any way hinder visualization.

Some analysis of 2D-PAGE gels has a direct complement in one-dimensional electrophoresis; the determination of molecular weight is done the same way in 2D-PAGE as in the simpler method. Analysis of 2D-PAGE gels can become more complicated, however, because it is not as easy to discern the identity of proteins with the naked eye. For careful analysis, image analysis software, such as Delta2D, can be useful. Delta2D can quantify protein spots, match images, compare corresponding spots and intensities of related gels, prepare gel data reports, remove background patterns, and integrate image information to databases.{{ref|DELTA}} There are also many other software packages available.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==
Using 2D-PAGE, hundreds to thousands of polypeptides can be analyzed in a single run. The proteins can be separated in pure form from the resultant spots. The spots can be quantified and further analyzed by mass spectrometry, depending on their resolution. Polypeptides can also be probed with antibodies and tested for post-translational modifications. 2D-PAGE is also used to study differential expression of proteins between cell types.

The disadvantages of this technique include a large amount of sample handling, limited reproducibility, and a smaller dynamic range than some other separation methods. It is also not automated for high throughput analysis. Certain proteins are difficult for 2D-PAGE to separate, including those that are in low abundance, acidic, basic, hydrophobic, very large, or very small. Through advancements in this technology, scientists are, however, able to separate low abundance proteins with moderate efficiency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{DSP Page}}

Most digital signals are infinite, or sufficiently large that the dataset cannot be manipulated as a whole. Sufficiently large signals are also difficult to analyze statistically, because statistical calculations require all points to be available for analysis. In order to avoid these problems, engineers typically analyze small subsets of the total data, through a process called '''windowing'''.

== Windowing Introduction ==

Windowing is the process of taking a small subset of a larger dataset, for processing and analysis. A naive approach, the '''rectangular window''', involves simply truncating the dataset before and after the window, while not modifying the contents of the window at all. However, as we will see, this is a poor method of windowing and causes power '''leakage'''.

== Applying Windows ==

Application of a window to a dataset will alter the spectral properties of that dataset. In a rectangular window, for instance, all the data points outside the window are truncated and therefore assumed to be zero. The cut-off points at the ends of the sample will introduce high-frequency components. 

Consider the system ''H(z)'', with input ''X(z)'' and output ''Y(z)''. We model this as:

:&lt;math&gt;Y(z) = X(z) H(z)&lt;/math&gt;

If we have a window with transfer function ''W(z)'', we can mathematically apply the window to our signal, ''X(z)'' as such:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{X}(z) = X(z) W(z)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, we can pass our windowed signal into our system, ''H(z)'' as usual:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{Y}(z) = \hat{X}(z) H(z)&lt;/math&gt;

== Leakage ==

If our signal is a lowpass or passband signal, the application of a window will introduce high-frequency components. Power from the original signal will be diverted from the specified frequency band into the high-frequency areas. This redistribution of power from a target band to the upper frequencies is known as ''leakage''.

If we look at a rectangular window, we know from duality that the frequency response of that window is a ''sinc'' function, which has non-zero values all the way out to both positive and negative infinity. Convolution of the ''sinc'' function with any narrow-band signal is going to cause a very spread-out spectrum.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== His prayer ==

Verses 1-26, sums up Jesus teachings,
Jesus begins to pray to the Father for different reasons. First, He prays for Himself (verses 1-5) then He continues and begins to pray for His apostles (verses 6-19 and 24-26) and for all believers and the world (verses 20-23). This prayer seems to combine all things done, past present, and future.
Each prayer depends on the one before it with Jesus being the foundation. (Petersen).

Jesus' prayer is the culmination of all of his ministry in the world.  Jesus prays for God to be glorified in what is about to come through him.  Jesus also prays for his disciples and all believers that God would bless them and the Holy Spirit would be revealed to them and be present in the believers' lives.

== Verses 1-5: Jesus Prays for Himself ==


Throughout this Gospel we have been told that his 'hour had not yet come' (the first occasion in John 2:4).  Jesus begins to express the desires of His heart in verses 1-5. Now, it 'has come'. Now he prays that he may be glorified.  No one can glorify him but the Father and he prays that he may so accept it as to bring glory to his Father in turn.  His “hour” had come for the Father to “glorify Thy Son,” (NAS) which would be through His death, resurrection, and ascension. He will be glorifying his Father by doing his will.

In verse 2 Christ was given two things; the “authority over all mankind” and the power to “give eternal life.” (NAS) 

He continues (v.3) to define this “eternal life” as knowing “the only true God” and Jesus Christ whom he had sent. This idea of mankind “knowing” God could have several interpretations. Some believe that knowing God was literal and so the verse seemed ambiguous. However, others believe that “knowing” God meant that mankind would no longer need a mediator and could have a personal knowing of God and Jesus Christ.

In verse 4 Jesus talks of His glorification and it should be noted that the language used in this verse implies that this glorification had already been done. “I glorified Thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which Thou hast given Me to do.” (NAS)  

In verse 5 Jesus states: &quot;Now, Father, glorify Me together with Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.” (NAS) Here some believe that Jesus was saying He had finished what he came into the world to do, but in order for Him to come into the world, Jesus had to set aside His glory and become a servant. However, Jesus is now asking for God to reinstate His glory as He left the world. (Philippians 2:5-11)  By asking for glory at God's side Jesus is also telling us that he is one with God and the Holy Spirit, thus reaffirming the holy Trinity of Christian belief, a very important concept in the times that were to come.  Through this belief, because all three are one in the same they cannot bestow glory on themselves, but have to ask for it from each other.

== Verses 6-19: Jesus Prays for His Disciples ==

This section of John Chapter 17 contains much of the essence of Jesus' prayer. He is specifically praying for those closest to him, the disciples.  In his prayer, Jesus details to his heavenly Father what has come to pass, what is, and what will be.  However, in all cases, the name of God is glorified.  The circumstance is special however; this is because Jesus' motives in the prayer lie with his disciples and their acceptance of God's word (aka Jesus).  &quot;...And glory has come to me through them...Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name--the name you gave me--so that they may be one as we are one (John 17:11).  Here Jesus asks that the disciples be granted unity.  However, he is not just asking for simple agreement; he is asking for the ultimate kind of unity: the unity of the Father, the Son. For those who say Jesus is God because he and the father are one this verse unravels that argument. He prays for the same oneness for his followers as he and the father share. Would that make his followers God? Hardly.

'''The Message of Christ's Prayer'''  &quot;I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours&quot;  Christ's words in verse 9 when he speaks of the disciples are somewhat unclear, and perhaps troublingly so.

  He mentions that he is not praying for &quot;the world. The next passage led me to believe that he was praying for the people within the world, but even then, it was only for the believers.  In verse 20 Christ says &quot;I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message.&quot;  There is no mention of those who will not believe in the message.  Are we to assume the worst?  

Yes we flippantly tell strangers &quot;Jesus loves you&quot;, but what does Jesus say? He says he loves his own, those who love the Father and Jesus and demonstrate it by obeying the commands of the Gospel.

Jesus commands us to love everyone including our enemies but he never says he loves sinners, he says he loves those who remain faithful to the Father and his gospel. His love is conditional. However the father's love is universal. He loves all humans.

This chapter contains the prayer of Jesus to the Father, which is overheard by His disciples. The first few verses directly concern Jesus himself, but the bulk of the prayer is for the apostles and those who would become believers later.  One of the amazing things about His prayer is that Jesus did not pray just for the apostles, but for those who would believe through their word. The apostles would preach the word, convert many people to Christ.  In addition, they would leave on record by their writings the gospels and the many letters. 

One of the great questions of Christianity is that of Jesus' relationship to God, and much of that has centered around John's gospel because of its more advanced theological identity.  Many point to passages such as John 10:30 in which Jesus proclaims, &quot;I and the Father are one,&quot; to suggest that John saw Jesus and God as being equal.  While that may certainly be the case if one reads verses 21-23 that says, &quot;21 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 22 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one: 23 I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity,&quot; it seems rather clear that Jesus is referring to a oneness of mind and purpose and not a oneness of power or physical being.  If the disciples are able to be one in the same sense that Jesus is one with God, it only makes sense if read as being united in purpose and thought, as is alluded to in verse 23.

Jesus' prayer was that all the disciples might be one in him and in the Father.  He prayed that all who truly believed might ultimately be with him where he was to behold the glory he would have with God (J. Boulton, 2006).

'''The Revelatory Work of Jesus'''  In 17:25-26, we have more language of being sent.  Jesus says, to his Father, whom he calls &quot;Righteous,&quot; &quot;The world does not know you, but I know you; and these know that you have sent me.&quot;  The disciples now know that Jesus came from the &quot;Righteous God.&quot;  Yet these verses imply that the disciples are able to know this only because Jesus &quot;made [God's] name known to them.&quot;  It has been said in earlier chapters that the work of the Paraclete is &quot;the revelation of Jesus himself to his disciples,&quot; (Smith 319).  Jesus says in 17:26, &quot;...I will make it known, so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.&quot;   

God loves everyone but has a special love for believers.
==Chapter 18 ==


	The Route to the Olive Grove of Gethsemane

Then Yahshuah, and the eleven, sang the Passover Hallel hymn which contains these lines
Psalm 118
They compass me about like bees; they are quenched as the
 fire of thorns;  verily, in the name of Yah I will cut them off. 
Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall; but Yah helped me. 
Yah is my strength and song; and He is become my salvation. 
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of the righteous; the right
 hand of Yah does valiantly.  The right hand of Yah is exalted; the right hand of
 Yah does  valiantly. I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of Yah. 
Yah has chastened me sore; but He has not given me over unto death…I will give
 thanks unto You, for Thou hast answered me, and art become my 
salvation. The stone which the builders rejected is become the chief corner-stone. 
This is Yah 'S doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. …O give thanks unto Yah, for He is  good, for His mercy endures forever. (Psa.118:1-29)  

After they sang, they went out of Yerushalayim through the Eastern gate, down through the valley of Gey-hinnom, crossed a bridge over the Kidron brook and ravine, and went up the Mount of Olives to an Olive Grove called Gethsemane (the Place of the Olive Press).
The valley of Gey-hinnom (Gehenna) is where Solomon defiled and sacrificed hundreds of young girls.
The Kidron ravine is the path David took when he was forced to flee Jerusalem by his son Absalom. David went up the Mount of Olives weeping.


   Judas Comes With the Rogues to Arrest Yahshuah            Jn.18

They could see torches, and people, moving into the garden coming towards them. It was Judas Ben Shimon of Keriot with a mob sent by the elders and chief priests (Sahmmai and Gamaliel). There were Temple guards with swords, and a band of Pharisees with staffs and clubs, and some rogue Mosaic Law experts. Judas had received the thirty pieces of silver and was about to betray Yahshuah.
Yahshuah fully realizing what was happening went to meet them and asked, 
“Who are you looking for?”
“Yahshuah of Netzeret.”
“I am he.”
 As soon as Yahshuah said ‘I am he,” the mob drew back and fell to the ground as if an invisible force had knocked them down. Yahshuah asked them again, “Who are you looking for?”
Rising to their feet, they said again, “Yahshuah of Netzeret.”
“I told you I am he. If you are only looking for me, then let the other men here go free.” he said this to fulfill the prophecy,
Of those that you gave me, I lost none.

Wounds made by a friend are intended to help, but an enemy's kisses are too much to bear.  Prov 27:6  
And as I watched, I saw Azazel approach Him and he kissed Him on the face and then stood behind Him.  And I said, &quot;0 Eternal One! Who is the Man insulted and beaten, who is worshipped by the nations and kissed by Azazel?&quot; And He answered and said, &quot;Hear Abraham! The Man you saw insulted and beaten and yet worshipped by many, He is the 'Relief' granted by the nations to the people who proceed from you, in the last days, in the twelfth hour of the age of ungodliness. But in the twelfth hour of my final age will I set up this Man (the Messiah, Yahshuah)  from your generation, whom you saw issue from among my people, and all who follow will become like this Man, and such as are called by me will join the others, even those who will to change within themselves. The Apocalypse of Abraham 1:55-56

	Peter Tries to prevent the Arrest  		        Jn. 23

Then Peter drew one of the two swords and struck the High Priest’s servant Melekh, and cut off his right ear.
Yahshuah restrained Peter and asked, “Shall I not drink the cup that Father has prepared me for? Put up your sword, all who live by the sword will die by the sword. Do you not understand that I could call 60,000 angels and Father would send them to me?”
The chariots of Yah are ten thousands and thousands upon thousands.  From the Dead Sea Scrolls Psalm 68:17  
And Elisha began to pray and said: O Yah, open his eyes, please, that he may see. Immediately Yah opened the attendant's eyes; so that he saw; and, look! the mountainous region was full of horses and war chariots of fire round about Elisha.  2Ki.6:17  
 Wisdom is better than weapons of war.  Ecclesiastes 9 :18
Anyone shedding man's blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God's image he made man.  Ge.9:6  
Yahshuah went to the wounded servant and touched the wound, and the bleeding stopped, and instantly his ear was back on his head as good as new. Then he said to the mob and the soldiers,
“Am I a wild bandit that you have to come after me with swords and clubs in the dark of night to arrest me? Do you think I am leading a gang of assassins and zealots? I am a teacher, and I have been peacefully sitting in the Temple every day this week in broad daylight telling people about the Kingdom of Yah. Apparently, no one thought I was a wild bandit then. So who has changed your mind about me? I will tell you who it was, it was Azazel, the devil, for he always does his work in the dark, the Prince of the Power of Darkness reigns over you, and so you do his bidding.”
Then they seized him and led him away. All the Apostles fled. A soldier grabbed one disciple by his robe, but he wiggled out of it, and fled away naked. 

The Ransom was paid in the garden
By allowing the forces of darkness to seize him Yahshuah paid the ransom. The ransom was paid at that moment in the garden. A sinless man surrendered himself as a prisoner exchange to Azazel. If he can remain sinless until death, he will break Azazel’s power to keep humans forever in the land of death. Azazel is confident that with a little torture Yahshuah will be easy to break. Azazel is unaware that if Yahshuah dies sinless, the curse of the Torah will fall upon him.
“Cursed is he who accepts a payment and then slays an innocent man.” (Deut. 27:25)

          Yahshuah in the House of Ananus , the Ringleader of the Rogues

The Temple guards first took him to the house of Ananus , the retired illegal High Priest; he was the ringleader of the rogues who had appointed his son-in-law Kayafa as his illegal successor.


222            Peter Denies Knowing Yahshuah Two Times

When the Apostles fled, two of them, Peter and Yahchanan  had followed the mob with Yahshuah. Yahchanan  had connections in the High Priest’s house and easily entered the courtyard. After a while, he spoke to the woman gatekeeper and arranged for Peter to enter. As Peter came in she asked, “Aren’t you one of Yahshuah’s followers? 
“No, I am not,” he said.
The Temple guards had built a fire in the courtyard and many slaves and other people were sitting around it warming themselves. Peter came and began to warm himself. One of the slave girls sitting there recognized him and said, “There is one of his followers. I saw him one day with Yahshuah.”
Peter denied it saying, “By my oath, I do not even know him miss, you are mistaken.”
“I am sure I saw him with Yahshuah of Netzeret,” she said, Peter heard a rooster crow off in the distance.

    		Ananus ’s Guard Strikes Yahshuah

Inside Ananus’ house, Ananus  questioned Yahshuah about the Gospel of the Kingdom and about his followers. Yahshuah said, “My teachings were never hidden. I said everything in public in the synagogues and in the Temple. Why do you question me? Ask the people who heard me speak, they will tell you what I taught.”
One of the guards struck Yahshuah in the mouth saying, “How dare you talk to the High Priest like this.”
Yahshuah, answered, “You know he has not been the High Priest for many years, and when he was in office,  he was not legally the High Priest, but a pretender. Therefore if I have said anything evil what was it? And if I broke no law, then why did you hit me?”
“And the men that held Yahshuah mocked him, and smote him.  And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote you?  And many other things blasphemously spake they against him”.  (Luke 22:63-65)

  		   Peter Denies Yahshuah the Third Time

Peter moved away to the porch of Kayafa’s house. One of the high Priest’s slaves saw him and said. “He is one of them. I saw him in the garden near my uncle Melekh.” 
Peter said, “I swear I do not know him.” The slave said, “Listen to the way he speaks, he is a Galilean.”
Peter said, “On my oath, may curses fall upon me if I am not telling the truth.” Immediately he heard a rooster crow the second time and he remembered what Yahshuah had said.
Meanwhile Ananus  had ordered Yahshuah transferred across the courtyard to the house of Kayafa. Yahshuah came onto the porch and he and Peter looked at each other. Peter ran from the courtyard and into the city weeping bitterly.
Roosters only crow at dawn, but the Romans soldiers used to blow an instrument 4 times during the night that sounded like a rooster. It would now be about midnight.

    		Yahshuah Tells the Rogues He is the Messiah 	

When it was morning Kayafa convened an illegal trial the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, 
Are you the Messiah? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, you will not believe me:  And if I also ask you a question, you will not answer me, nor let me go.  (Luk 22:67-68) 
Kayafa  brought in false witnesses to condemned Yahshuah. The witnesses however kept contradicting each other. At last, two witnesses came in and said, “This man said if we tear down the Temple made with hands, in three days he could build it with his own two hands.” 
“With one hand,” one of the witnesses said. 
“No with two,” the other said. 
The two witnesses began to argue and Kayafa said to Yahshuah, “Well what you say was it with one hand or two?”
Moses wrote in the Scroll of Deuteronomy:
 On the evidence of two or three witnesses the death sentence shall be executed; a person must not be put to death on the evidence of only one witness.  The hands of the witnesses shall be the first raised against the person to execute the death penalty, and afterwards the hands of all the people. So you shall purge the evil from your midst.   Deut 17:6-7
False witnesses have risen up against me and they breathe out violence. From the Dead Sea Scrolls Psalm 27:12  
Wicked and deceitful people have opened their mouths against me and have spoken against me with lying tongues. They surround me with words of hatred and attack me without a cause.  From the Dead Sea Scrolls Psalm 109:2   

Yahshuah was silent. Kayafa asked,
 “Have you nothing to say?” Yahshuah said nothing.”
He was hard pressed and he was letting himself be afflicted; yet he would not open his mouth.  He was brought like just like a sheep to the slaughter; and like a ewe that before her shearers has become mute, he also would not open his mouth.  Is.53:7 
Kayafa stood up and shouted, “I want you to swear by the living Eloah and tell us whether or not you are the Messiah the son of Yah.”
Yahshuah said, “I am the Messiah, the son of Yah, and furthermore this mortal man will ascend to heaven, and you will see him seated at the right hand of Yah riding on the Shokeyn cloud of Glory.”
It is written in the Scroll of Daniel:   I kept on looking in the visions of the night and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a mortal happened to be coming ; and to the Ancient of days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One.   And to him there was given him, a rulership and dignity and a kingdom, that all peoples, national groups, and languages should all serve him. His rulership is an everlasting rulership that will not pass away, and his kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.   Dan.7:13  
Then Kayafa broke the law and tore his own robe 
Subsequently Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons:  Do not let YOUR heads go ungroomed, and YOU must not tear YOUR garments, that YOU may not die.   Lv.10:6 

Then Kayafa  screamed, “He has blasphemed. You heard his blasphemy. We need no more witnesses. He is guilty of death.”
It is written:   So the abuser of Yah’s name should be put to death without fail.  The entire congregation should without fail pelt him with stones.  Lv.24:16  

Then everyone, including the slaves, rushed at him and began spitting on him and hitting him. Someone put a blindfold on him and hit him saying, “Prophesy O great Adoni and tell us who hit you.”

    Judas Returns the Thirty Pieces of Silver and Commits Suicide

After they had sent Yahshuah to the dungeon, Judas Ben Shimon of Keriot came in and said to the chief priests (Gamaliel and Shammai)  and senators, “I have betrayed an innocent man.”
They said, “That is your affair, we had nothing to do with it.” Judas went to the Temple and hurled the thirty pieces of silver into the treasury. Then he hung himself in a tree. As he was hanging, the limb broke and he fell to the ground. His stomach burst open and his entrails spilled out. Therefore, the Jews called it the haunted place, Aceldama, the Field of Blood.
But you, O God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction; bloody and deceitful men will not live out half their days; but, I will trust in you.  Ps.55:23  

      The Thirty Pieces of Silver Used to Buy a Cemetery for the Poor

When the priests found the coins, the next day they said, “This is blood money, we cannot put it in the treasury, and so they used it to buy a cemetery for paupers on the site of an old pottery field and thus was fulfilled the Prophecies.
Cast it into the treasury, the goodly price that I was prized by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the treasury, in the house of Yah...and gave them for the Potter’s field.      -Zech. 13

   The Rogues Have Their First Meeting With Pilate Asking Him to Execute Yahshuah   

At dawn, the rogue chief priests (Gamaliel and Shammai) , rogue Mosaic Law Experts, and rogue Senators met and decided to take Yahshuah to the Roman Prefect, Pilate. They took him to the government headquarters, the Praetorian. 
The kings of the earth take their stand and high officials themselves have massed together as one against Yah  and against his anointed one.  Ps.2:2  

 If Jews enter a non-Jewish dwelling, they are considered defiled, and none of these rogues wanted to be defiled, or they would not be able to eat the coveted Passover meal, so they requested Pilate to come out to them. Pilate is believed to have come from Scotland, he ruled from 26 to 36 AD. The Jewish Encyclopedia says,
“His administration was characterized by corruption, violence, robberies, ill treatment of the people, and continuous executions without even the form of a trial…Pilate looted “funds from the sacred treasury in order to provide for the construction of an aqueduct”…when the citizens protested he sent among the crowds disguised soldiers carrying concealed daggers, who massacred a great number, not only of the rioters, but of casual spectators…Pilate's last deed of cruelty, and the one which brought about his downfall, was the massacre of a number of Samaritans who had assembled on Mount Gerizim to dig for some sacred vessels.” http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=312&amp;letter=P&amp;search=pilate  
When Pilate saw them with a prisoner, for Yahshuah was bound with a chain, he asked, “What are the charges?”
They tried to dispense with the charges saying, “If he wasn’t a terrible criminal we would not have bothered you so early in the morning.”
Pilate said, “Why don’t you try him in your own law court?”
They said, “As you know since you Romans took over, you took away our right to execute criminals.” 
This was to fulfill the prophecy that he would be lifted up and hung in a tree, for that is how the Romans executed people. (The Jews stoned, burned or beheaded them).

Here are the charges:
•	SEDITION 

•	TAX EVASION

•	IMPERSONATING A KING 

•	IMPERSONATING THE MESSIAH 

•	IMPERSONATING GOD 

“This man is a wizard, shaman, warlock, and an insurrectionist. He is stirring up the people telling them not to pay taxes to Caesar, and claiming to be the Messiah, the King of the Jews.”
Pilate said to Yahshuah, “What do you have to say about all these charges?”
Yahshuah said nothing and Pilate marveled.

         		 Yahshuah is Questioned by Pilate		

 Pilate ordered Yahshuah to be brought inside to the Judgment Hall, and then asked him, 
“Are you the King of the Jews?”
Yahshuah asked, “Are you truly trying to understand this for yourself? Or are you only trying to confirm what the illegal chief priests (Gamaliel and Shammai)  said about me?”
Pilate said, “Only a Jew would care about these things, do I look like a Jew? Your own nation and chief priests, Shammai and Gamaliel, have brought you to me. What did you do?”
Yahshuah denies being any part of the Jewish/Israeli nation:
Yahshuah said, “My Kingdom (my nation)  is not of this Cosmos. If it were, my followers would have fought to keep me from being arrested.”
Pilate said, “Ah ha! So you are a King then?”
Yahshuah said, “Yes I am. But my kingship is not to reign over others as earthly kings reign, but to deliver the truth. Everyone who is on the side of truth will listen to me.
a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire. 
Ecclesiasticus (from the Latin Vulgate): 3:31    

Pilate turned his back, and as he walked away, he rhetorically quipped, “What is the truth?”  (It is clear by Pilates reply that he, like most of the elite in Rome, and followed the philosophy Pyrrho, the Skeptic, which denied that truth can be known. They believed only fools spoke of the truth.)

   	     Pilate Tells the Rogues to Take Yahshuah to Antipas

Pilate went out to the priests and senators and said, “He is innocent of any crimes. We Romans do not kill a man unless he commits a serious crime. It is not a crime to say you are a king of another Cosmos come to deliver the truth.”
The rogues began to accuse Yahshuah more fiercely saying, “This man has been preaching rebellion throughout the nation. He began in the Galil region and now he is here”. 
When Pilate detected that Yahshuah was from the Galil region, he said. “King Antipas is in town for the feast. If this man is a Galilean, take him to Antipas.”

  			 Yahshuah Before Antipas			

So the angry rogues took Yahshuah to Antipas. Antipas was fearful and delighted. He feared Yahshuah might be John, the Baptizer, come back from the dead, and he was delighted for he had heard much about Yahshuah and wanted to meet him, hoping to be entertained by a miracle. Antipas asked him many questions, but Yahshuah stood in complete silence. The rogues stood shouting out the charges against him, but he said not a word.
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.  Isa 53:7  

It is written in the Scroll of Jeremiah:
 But I was like a gentle lamb
  led to the slaughter.
And I did not know it was against me
  that they devised schemes, saying,
‘Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,
 let us cut him off from the land of the living,
 so that his name will no longer be remembered!’ 
  From the Dead Sea Scrolls Jerm 11:19
Antipas and his guards began to mock and ridicule him and treat him despicably. They brought some bright white cloth interwoven with silver specks that dazzled in the sun. They fashioned a king’s costume for him then sent him back to Pilate. From that day forward, Antipas and Pilate, who had been enemies, became fast friends.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Trigonometry==
'''Trigonometry''' is the branch of mathematics dealing with the measures of the sides and angles of a triangle. Using trigonometric ratios, one can determine the side and angle measures (i.e. &quot;solve the triangle&quot;) using minimal information.

&lt;!--I copied this section from the chapter on the triangle inequality.unsure why it was there. --&gt;
===What is a right triangle?=== 
A right triangle is any triangle where one angle measures 90º.  A right triangle consists of two small sides, across from the smaller angles, and a longer side, across from the right angle.  The sides of a right triangle have special names.  The two smaller ones are called ''legs'', and the longer side is called the ''hypotenuse'' (pronounced hi-POT-uh-noose).&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Geometry-ch6-triParts.png]]&lt;br&gt;
Notice that the bottom-left angle is 90 degrees. The sides labelled &quot;opposite&quot; and &quot;adjacent&quot; are the legs, and the names are in reference to the angle &quot;a&quot;.  These terms will always be used when discussing sides of a right triangle, and will always be given in reference to some angle.  Remember, '''the hypotenuse is always the longest side and is always across from the right angle'''. 

====Practice====
Let's practice what we've learned.
For the triangle below, fill in the blanks.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Geom-ch6-triWithMesaures.png]]&lt;br&gt;
What is the length of the hypotenuse?                _________&lt;br&gt;
What is the length of the side opposte angle &quot;a&quot;?    _________&lt;br&gt;
What is the length of the side adjacent to angle &quot;a&quot;?_________&lt;br&gt;
{{HideNseek|title=View answers|text=The correct answers are 10 feet, 8 feet, and 6 feet respectively.}}

====More Practice====
Rotating a right triangle does not alter the names of the sides.  Consider the following triangle: Can you name the hypotenuse, adjacent and opposite sides?&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Geom-ch6-triUpsideDown.png]]&lt;br&gt;
Even though this right angle has been rotated, the sides are still named with respect to the angle &quot;a&quot;.  See if you can identify the sides of the triangle below.  Remember that everything is from the point of view of angle &quot;a&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
What is the length of the hypotenuse?              ___________feet&lt;br&gt;   
What is the length of the side opposite angle &quot;a&quot;? ___________feet&lt;br&gt;
What is the length of side adjacent to angle &quot;a&quot;?  ___________feet&lt;br&gt;            
{{HideNseek|title=View answers|text=The correct answers are 6 feet, 4 feet, 3 feet, respectively.}}

==Trigonometric ratios==
The three most common trigonometric ratios are '''sine''' (abbreviated &quot;sin&quot;), '''cosine''' (abbreviated &quot;cos&quot;), and '''tangent''' (abbreviated &quot;tan&quot;). These trigonometric ratios can be determined contingent on the information you have available. If the angle measure is given, entering sin(x), cos(x), or tan(x) in most scientific calculators (where &quot;x&quot; is the angle measure) will yield the sine, cosine, and tangent of the given value.

===Soh Cah Toa===
[[Image:Sohcahtoa.svg|thumb|150px|right|Figure 1. In this example, angle A is the reference angle, and so side a must be the opposite side and side c the adjacent side. Side b is the hypotenuse.]]
In a right triangle, if you are given at least two of the side measures, you can determine the sine, cosine, or tangent using a method commonly referred to by the mnenomic device ''Soh Cah Toa''. What this refers to is:
* Soh: '''s'''ine = '''o'''pposite / '''h'''ypotenuse
* Cah: '''c'''osine = '''a'''djacent / '''h'''ypotenuse
* Toa: '''t'''angent = '''o'''pposite / '''a'''djacent
The terms ''opposite'' and ''adjacent'' are in relation to the '''reference angle''', which is the angle your calculations are based upon. In Figure 1, since angle ''A'' is the reference angle, then the side opposite of that angle is side ''a''. While there are two sides adjacent to angle ''A'', side ''b'' is designated as the hypotenuse so side ''c'' is the adjacent side. Therefore, in Figure 1:
* sin(A) = a/b
* cos(A) = c/b
* tan(A) = a/c
Please note that &quot;sin(A)&quot; is read as &quot;sine of A,&quot; &quot;cos(A)&quot; is read as &quot;cosine of A,&quot; and &quot;tan(A)&quot; is read as &quot;tangent of A.&quot;

For example, if ''a = 7'' and ''c = 14'', you would need to find the tangent of angle A, as the other two ratios require the hypotenuse which is unavailable. As the tangent is the opposite divided by the adjacent, you would get ''tan(A) = 7/14'', which can be simplified to one-half.

===What now?===
:''Note: Please make sure first that your calculator gives angle measures in degrees.''
When determining the measures of a triangle, the sines, cosines, and tangents have a function: determining the angle measure. Above, it was determined that the tangent of the reference angle, ''A'', is 1/2. If you entered tan&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(1/2) into a scientific calculator, you will see that you will get the angle measure of ''A'', which is approximately 26.6°. You now have two angle measures: 26.6° and 90°, since this is a right triangle. Since the sum of all angles in a triangle is 180°, subtract the two known angle measures from 180 and you will get the third angle measure: 63.4°.

Solving the side and angle measures of triangles will be covered in more depth in [[Geometry/Chapter 19|Chapter 19]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rhino Mocks can be used to test events on interfaces.  For example, let's assume an interface that represents an editor view.  This might in turn be implemented by an untested, lightweight user control in a WinForms application:

 public interface IView
 {
   event EventHandler UserClickedSomething;
 }

We'll be testing the presenter class of this view.  An NUnit test that asserts some action takes place due to this event being raised might look like this:

 [Test]
 public void UserClickedSomething_Handled()
 {
     MockRepository mocks = new MockRepository();
     
     // create the mock
     IView viewMock = (IView)mocks.CreateMock(typeof(IView));
 
     // indicate that we expect an event handler to be attached.
     // in doing so, we obtain an IEventRaiser instance.
     viewMock.UserClickedSomething += null;
     IEventRaiser raiser = LastCall.IgnoreArguments().GetEventRaiser();
 
     // we've finished recording.
     mocks.ReplayAll();
 
     // create our presenter
     Presenter presenter = new Presenter(viewMock);
 
     // no indication from the user yet.
     Assert.IsFalse(presenter.IsUserAlive);
 
     // simulate user action by raising event on mocked interface.
     raiser.Raise(viewMock, EventArgs.Empty);
 
     mocks.VerifyAll();
 
     // user is known to be alive and kicking.
     Assert.IsTrue(presenter.IsUserAlive);

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is design, technology, and philosophy? ==

Before the discussion of science, philosophy, and technology, there should be comparison and explanation of these concepts. It is better to take a look at these pages:

*What is Design? [http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/trinity/watdes.html]
*What is Technology? [http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/trinity/watistec.html]
*Technology is Related to Science? [http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/trinity/relate.html]
*What is philosophy? [http://www.dartmouth.edu/~phil/whatis/wsa.html]

== Instructional Design is science? ==
Rowland (1993) explains that both Charles M. Reigeluth and Rita Richey emphasize the science of instructional design because &quot;they feel that design principles accurately predict future phenomena - in this case, learning - and therefore can be used to prescribe instructional events&quot; (p.89) Based on this statement, one can say that instructional designers seek understanding and then apply the principles of design while they are engaged in designing instruction; therefore, instructional design is a science.

Apart from being able to predict future phenomena, and prescribe instructional events, the complexities of the design process require scientific principles and approaches to handle instructional problems. For example, instructional design employs empirical methods in analysis, design, and repeated tryout and revisions to validate the effectiveness of the instructional materials. Through experiments, science simulates natural processes in controlled environments in order to better understand natural phenomena. If through the creation and design of instruction, learners can exhibit observable changes in behavior, knowledge and skills which can be attributed to the use of the instruction (or such attributes can be predicted in a defined instructional context), then why can't instructional design be categorized as science?

In a multifaceted definition of instructional design as a process, a discpline and a reality, Penn State staff also view instructional design as &quot;the science of creating detailed specifications for the development, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance of situations that facilitate the learning of both large and small units of subject matter at all levels of complexity.&quot; (Adapted from &quot;Training and Instructional Design&quot;, Applied Research Laboratory, Penn State University [http://www.umich.edu/%7Eed626/define.html])

== Instructional Design (ID) is philosophy? ==
Whether you are a practicing instructional designer or a student learning in the field of Instructional Design, you will make instructional and learning decisions for others and yourself.  Your design decisions are based on your own beliefs and values.  Smith and Ragan (2005) state &quot;fields of study, such as instructional design, do not have educational philosophies; people who study in these fields do&quot; (p.18). In other words, instructional designers bring to their craft their own unique ideas, beliefs and values about the process of education and this serves as a backdrop which exerts both overt and subtle influence on how designers practice. These practice decisions include how designers choose particular design models, how designers carry out assessments, what evaluation measures are chosen, what direction to take when confronted with conficting development needs, just to name a few. Solomon (2000)effectively synthesizes a rich body of literatures in the field and aims to &quot;provide insight into understanding that various ways in which philosophy shapes instructional design practice&quot; (p.23). 

There are four critical philosophies had impact on ID theory: (a) modernism, (b)critical theory, (c)pragmatism, and (d) post modernism [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Instructional_Technology/Instructional_Design/The_Paradigm_Shift]. They have shaped paradigms that construct ID models. In fact, the ID theory is stemmed from philosophical roots but not directly. The paradigms play critical role here. 

In spite of Smith and Ragan's (2005) assertion, Gagne &amp; Merrill (1990); Merrill (1993); and Spector (1994) have explored extensively the philosophy of instructional design. The nature and elements of the building blocks of instructional design, as well as practical application of learning situations have been discussed. Instructional design is based, in part, on the concepts of sequencing instructions, mastery of learning, and is performance-oriented. ID relies on the principles of andragogy, which emphasize experiential learning and other fundamental theories of learning such as cognitivism, behaviorism, and constructivism. According to Spector (2000)[http://ifets.ieee.org/periodical/vol_3_2000/spector.html]learning essentially involves a change in abilities, attitudes, beliefs, capabilities, knowledge, mental models, patterns of interaction or skills. Differentiating and exploring these concepts will further expand the basis of instructional design philosophy.

The advent of distance education added another layer of complexity and Ely (1999) predicts that the growing application, need and interest of distance education may foment the &quot;philosophy of humanistic technology&quot; in the field of instructional technology.

== Instruction Design is technology? ==
In his discussion on the philosophy of instructional technology, Ely says &quot;it may seem strange that in the above discussion of the relationship between a field and a discipline that technology was not considered to be one of the roots of the field. After all, it is the most frequently mentioned term used in the various attempts to give identity to the field&quot; (p.3)

To further muddy the waters of this discussion, we must make mention of the fact that there is considerable thought and numerous writings devoted to the &quot;philosphy of technology.&quot; David Blacker of Illinois State University, for example, as written an essay on &quot;The Philosphy of Technology and Education: An Invitation to Inquiry&quot; [http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EPS/PES-Yearbook/94_docs/BLACKER.HTM].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A verb is a part of speech that usually denotes action (&quot;bring&quot;, &quot;read&quot;), occurrence (&quot;to decompose&quot; (itself), &quot;to glitter&quot;), or a state of being (&quot;exist&quot;, &quot;live&quot;, &quot;soak&quot;, &quot;stand&quot;). Depending on the language, a verb may vary in form according to many factors, possibly including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. It may also agree with the person, gender, and/or number of some of its arguments (what we usually call subject, object, etc.). 

Verbs can be conveyed in many ways. Lets look in particular at the word &quot;wear&quot;

She wears a pink dress - This sentence is made up of three main parts, she, being the noun. Wears, being an action or 'doing' word. Pink, describing the noun about to be added to the sentence and, Dress, the noun which pulls all these words together (giving them all one key point) to complete the sentence.

==Grammatica 15 Modal particles==

Recall:

:''.. Er zit weinig anders op om het winkelen voorlopig '''maar''' te vergeten ..''
:''.. maar ik ben '''nog maar net''' begonnen met mijn werk ..''
:''..Ik weet de naam '''niet''', maar ik weet '''wel''' ..''
:''.. Dan weet ik '''wel''' wie u bedoelt ..''
:''.. Ik zal '''wel even''' vragen of ..''
:''..Dus, zegt u mij uw naam eens?..''

Dutch has a variety of adverbs that function as modal particles. They are often hard to translate exactly. They do not have so much a clear 'meaning', but add a certain flavor to the phrase they are in.

;wel

The adverb ''wel'' is strictly speaking the adverbial form of the adjective ''goed'', just as English ''well'' and ''good''. Nevertheless it is used rather differently in Dutch. One meaning it has is to negate the words ''niet'' (not) and ''geen'' (not a, no):

: dit is niet uw portemonnee
:: this is not your wallet
: Wel! Dit is wel mijn portemonnee
:: yes, it is!

:''..Ik weet de naam '''niet''', maar ik weet '''wel''' ..''
:: I '''do not''' know the name, but I '''do''' know...

It is often used to introduce ''but'':

:ik heb wel gezegd dat ... maar...
::I did say that ... but...

It is often added to a sentence to indicate that he speaker is making an admission or is volunteering something:

: Ik zal wel vragen..
:: let me go ask.. (I volunteer)

Another use is to indicate that something is exceptional:

:er waren wel dertig tornado's!
::there were thirty tornadoes (no less!)

;even

''even'' indicates that the action will not cost much time or effort. Adding it to a sentence adds an implicit ''no problem'' to the utterance:

:''.. Ik zal '''wel even''' vragen of ..''

:: Let me go ask,  no problem, will take just a moment 

;eens

literally ''eens'' means once, but it is often added to add a flavor of an exceptional occasion.

:heb je wel eens..? - did you ever.. ?
: zal ik eens koffie zetten? - (for a change) would you like me to make coffee? 

; maar 

The word ''maar'' can be used as a (co-ordinating) conjunction and is usually translated by ''but''. 
It is also an abverb with the meaning of ''only'', ''just'':

:ik heb maar zeven euro op zak
::I only have seven euro on me

:Geeft u mij maar een biertje
:: Just give me a beer

However it can also be a modal adverb that indicates a certain measure of resignation or lack of choice of the speaker:

: ik heb maar gezegd dat ...
: I said that ..., because I did not know what else to say

:''.. Er zit weinig anders op dan het winkelen voorlopig '''maar''' te vergeten ..''
:: lit : there is little else on (the list of options) than to forget ''(sigh..)'' the shopping spree temporarily

Adding ''maar'' can also 'soften' the sentence and indicate that  the speaker is trying to be polite or friendly.

:geef hier!  - give it (..or else!) 
:geef maar hier!  - why don't you give it to me (Don't worry: I'll take care of it)

With a more ironic intonation it could also mean:

:just give it up - (you're busted)

;combinations

In Dutch modal particle can be heaped up into interesting combinations of flavors, e.g.:

:hij zou wel eens even laten zien hoe sterk hij was -  he was going to show off how strong he was (but ..)

==Grammatica 15-2 The old cases==

:Recall : '''de plek des onheils''' – an old genitive.

Indo-European languages, to which both English and Dutch belong were originally highly inflectional with eight cases, three genders and usually four or five declensions. Both languages have lost this system, Dutch however a bit later than English. In fact in the written standard language Dutch retained four cases and three genders up to the spelling reform of 1947. In the spoken language the case endings and the masculine-feminine distinction had been gone for much longer, but prior to the second world war the educational and political establishment tenaciously tried to preserve the case system, even tried to introduce forms that never existed in the language artificially.  

The discrepancy between written standard and spoken language led to serious educational problems with equally serious social consequences. After the destruction by the second world war spelling modernization was imperative and a lot of old baggage was thrown overboard. Since then case endings are a bit of an unpopular subject. They are often seen as oldfashioned, even harmful to 'progress'. Nevertheless, there is a fair bit of remnants left in the modern language even though case endings have definitely ceased to be part of a system. The leftovers are ''idiom'' more than ''grammar''. To understand the remnants it is useful to have a peek at the definite article as it was before 1947:

{|
! case!! masculine!! feminine !! neuter !! plural
|-
|nominative || de || de ||het ||de
|-
|genitive || des || der ||des ||der
|-
|dative || de(n) || de(r) || den ||den
|-
|accusative || de'''n''' || de ||het ||de
|}

The above implies that prior to 1947 one ''had'' to write:

: ik zien de'''n''' man
: ik zie de vrouw

Worse than that, it was:

: ik vereer de deugd (f)
: ik haat den leugen (m)

Most people above the Rhine had to use a dictionary to do the latter right, because the m-f contrast was no longer alive in their spoken mother tongue and neither were the -n and -r endings.

In 1947 a small (but sweeping) change was allowed in the spelling: the '''n''' in the masculine accusative was made ''optional''.  With a sigh of relief everybody promptly stopped using the infamous ''buigings-n''  and it has not been used since... This change obliterated both the accusative-nominative distinction and the masculine-feminine one.   

The dative only occurred when indirect objects were used without a preposition. All prepositions had come to use the accusative which was now identical to the nominative for anything but personal pronouns.  The genitive was still a bit more common although it was always possible to use a construction with ''van'' to avoid it:

:de vloek der mensheid –&gt; de vloek van de mensheid

Thus the change of 1947 basically put an end to the case endings as a system.

Still, there are numerous relics that are difficult to understand, let alone use properly, without some knowledge of the old system.

===Genitives===

As in English, genitives are regularly used to indicate possession with proper names:

: Jans auto
::John's car

There is a growing tendency to extend this usage to female proper names (in defiance of the old case endings) in stead of a construction using the clitic form of the possessive pronoun.

: Annies auto  - Annie d'r auto

For inanimate nouns the genitive is clearly on its way out, although the plural can occasionally still be seen: 

: het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden
: de prins der dieven
:het periodiek systeem der elementen – the periodic system of the elements

Occasionally people deliberately opt to use the odd archaic expression like ''plek des onheils'' as a stylistic gadget. 

The adjective still has a productive partitive genitive in -s that occurs after words like wat, iets, veel etc.:

: iets lekkers – something yummy

A modicum of productivity also occurs in expressions using ''tot ... toe''. In this type of expression a verb is used in its genitive form:

: tot berstens toe - such that it almost bursts
: tot bloedens toe - such that blood was flowing


The genitive occurs in various fossilized forms -usually functioning as adverbs- like:

:'s ochtends – in the morning, at day break
:'s morgens  - in de morning
:'s middags – in the afternoon
:'s avonds – in the evening
:'s nachts – in the night
:'s winters – during the winter
:tweemaal daags  - twice a day 
:barrevoets - barefoot
:blootshoofds – with bare head
:grotendeels – for the most part
:een ieder ging zijn'''s''' weeg'''s'''  - each went in his own direction

Notice the vowel change in ''dag – daags'' and ''weg - weegs''

The form 's is a clitic form of ''des'', the masc/neuter genitive article. Notice the -n of grotendeels. The adjective had had both strong and weak endings (as it still does in German) and the -n is weak ending.

===Datives===

One preposition had stubbornly retained the dative and it still occurs mostly in petrified dative forms. It is the word ''te'' – at, to. The noun originally received an -e in this case. The proposition often occurs fused with the old dative articles:

:te + den  -&gt; ten  (masc and neut. sg.)
:te + der  -&gt; ter  (fem sg. and plural)

:ten tijde van  - in the days of..
:ten hoogste -  at the most
:ten dele – partly
:ten eerste - firstly

:terdege - thoroughly
: ter gelegenheid – on the occasion of
: ter aarde bestellen – commit to earth, bury

Interestingly the old feminine dative ''ter'' still enjoys a measure of productivity in combinations with verbal nouns in -ing:

:ter wikifiëring - to be wikified

This also holds for words in -heid

:ter gelegenheid

This is one reason why words ending in -ing, -te, -tie, -heid are recognized as feminine proper and Dutch does not have a common gender like a number of Scandinavian languages..

''te'' also occurs without articles:

:te allen tijde – at all times 
:te zijner tijd – in due course
:te gelegener tijd – at a convenient moment

Notice that '''tijd''' is feminine in the latter two, masculine in the other, a good example of how corrupt the case/gender had become in the end. The feminine is probably a German influence (die Zeit is feminine). There are more oddities:

: het hart – ter harte  (neuter -feminine) 

''Te'' also has a few non-archaic usages. It is used in combination with infinitives as ''to'' does in English:

: Dat is goed om '''te''' weten – that is good '''to''' know
: Hij begon af '''te''' vallen – he began '''to'''  lose weight

It is also used to indicate excess, as English ''too'':

:Dit is te veel – This is too much.

Or with locations,  as English ''at'' or ''in'' :

: te A'dam – in Amsterdam

A few other prepositions had taken the dative in a previous phase of the language and some forms remain:

: van den bloede  - of (royal) blood
: van harte! - from all my heart
: met verve – with passion
: in den beginne – in the beginning (Genesis)
: in koelen bloede

===Accusatives===
As in English accusatives are common for personal pronouns only

:ik -- mij

Accusative relics are rare because the case resembled the nominative, but a greeting like:

: goede'''n'''avond 

has an extra -n- because it was an accusative ending of the adjective goed.

===Verhaal: Zijn zieke moeder===
Het sneeuwde hard, de oostenwind gierde over de vlakte en sneed door alle kleding. Jan rilde, maar hij vermande zich en trok zijn muts wat verder over zijn oren. Hij gaf zijn Harley wat meer gas. Toen het bericht hem bereikte dat er naar hem gevraagd was, had hij gezegd dat hij, als het maar even kon, komen zou. Dit was en bleef zijn moeder tenslotte. Wat er ook gebeurd mocht zijn, hij moest er niet aan denken dat zij zou kunnen sterven zonder haar nog een laatste keer te zien. Daarvoor herinnerde hij zich te veel goede tijden met haar.

De kamer waar ze lag was niet groot en had een echte ziekenhuislucht. Plichtmatig groette hij zijn zus en die zwager waar hij nooit mee op had kunnen schieten.  

::Ma?
:::Jongen, ben je toch gekomen?
::Ja natuurlijk. Hoe is het nou?
:::Ach, gaat wel.. Ze zorgen goed voor me hier. 
::Heeft de dokter nog wat gezegd?
:::De dokter? Ja, ik mag weer naar huis. Was het niet veel te koud? Je bent helemaal nat..
::Ja het sneeuwt een beetje.  Mag je weer naar huis? Zo! Wanneer? 
:::Vrijdag, geloof ik...

Ze zuchtte. Haar ogen sloten zich en gingen niet meer open.

{{Dutch/Translation|verhaal

It was snowing hard, the easterly wind blasted across the plain and cut through all clothing. Jan shivered, but pulled himself together and pulled his cap a bit further over his ears. He gave his Harley a bit more gas. When the message reached him that he had been called for, he had said that he would come if ever he could. This was his mother after all and would always be. Whatever may have happened, he could not bear the thought that she might die without seeing her a last time. He remembered too many good times with her. 

The room she was in was not very large and had a typical hospital smell. Dutifully, he greeted his sister and this brother-in-law he had never gotten along with.
::Mam?
:::Son, did you come anyway?
::Of course. How are you doing?
:::Oh, not too bad.. They are taking good care of me here
::Did the doctor tell you anything?
:::The doctor? Oh, yes I can go home again! Wasn't it far too cold? You are all wet..
::Yeah, it is snowing a bit. Can you go home again? Wow! When is that?
:::Friday, I think...

She sighed. Her eyes closed and did not open again.

===Introduction to ''werkwoorden''===
The second large family of words besides the ''naamwoorden'' is that of the verbs, the ''werkwoorden''. The types that are important in Dutch are basically the same ones as in English:

#transitive verbs - overgankelijke werkwoorden
#ditransitive verbs -  ditransitieve werkwoorden
#intransitive verbs - onovergankelijke werkwoorden
#reflexive verbs - wederkerende werkwoorden
#impersonal verbs - onpersoonlijke werkwoorden
#copulas - koppelwerkwoorden
#auxiliary verbs - hulpwerkwoorden
#modal verbs - modale werkwoorden

However, the conjugation of these verbs is not exactly the same as in English, particularly in their choice of auxiliary verbs. E.g. some of the intransitive verbs in Dutch take ''zijn'' in the perfect rather than ''hebben'', which is why we will split this category into ergative and inergative verbs. The following table summarizes the usage of auxiliaries and the approximate percentage of total verbs that a particular type represents. (The percentages are based on the verbs currently in the data base of nl.wiktionary on June 9, 2012)

====Transitive verbs – Overgankelijke werkwoorden====
They are by largest category by far (58% of total). A transitive verb has a direct object which can be converted into an object in the passive voice.  Their name refers to the fact that they can undergo this transition (''overgang'') using the auxiliary verb ''worden''.

:Ik zie het paard → Het paard ''wordt'' door mij gezien

The active perfect tense is formed  using the auxiliary verb ''hebben'', the passive perfect with the auxiliary verb ''zijn''

:Ik ''heb'' het paard gezien → Het paard ''is'' door mij gezien

The above passives are personal: they center around &quot;het paard&quot; as subject. In Dutch passives can also be impersonal, particularly if they center about something indefinite. Impersonal passives are usually initiated with the word &quot;er&quot;.

:Jan bakt veel brood  - Er wordt (door Jan) veel brood gebakken.
:John bakes a lot of bread - There is a lot of bread being baked (by John).

In English such constructions are somewhat cumbersome and infrequent, mostly limited to continuous tenses. In Dutch they are quite frequent.

=====Ditransitive verbs=====
The verb can have other objects, like indirect ones or prepositional ones. In English these can be transposed into a passive construction where the indirect object becomes the subject

:He gives ''me'' - ''I'' am given by him
:He sent for ''me'' - ''I'' was sent for by him

Notice that ''me'' is transposed into ''I'' in English. 

In such cases it is possible to construct an impersonal passive ''without'' a subject in Dutch. Often the locative adverb ''er'' is used to open the sentence.

:Hij geeft mij - ''Mij'' wordt door hem gegeven / Er wordt door hem ''aan mij'' gegeven
:Hij vroeg naar mij - Er werd door hem ''naar mij'' gevraagd 

Notice that the object does ''not'' become subject. There are [[:nl:wikt:Categorie:Ditransitief werkwoord in het Nederlands|some verbs]] where it ''can'' become the subject but in Dutch. However, this is done not with ''worden'' but with ''krijgen'' (to get) as auxiliary:

:De '''kok''' schotelde de man een biefstuk voor - The cook served the man a steak.
:Door de kok werd aan de man een '''biefstuk''' voorgeschoteld  - A steak was served ..
:De '''man''' kreeg een '''biefstuk''' voorgeschoteld -  The man got served ....

=====Accusative verbs=====
A small group of Dutch verbs do have a direct object, but they cannot undergo the transition to a passive voice.

:aanhebben - to wear (clothes)

:Hij heeft een jas aan - Hij heeft een jas aangehad.

:&lt;s&gt;Een jas wordt aangehad door hem.&lt;/s&gt;  is not a valid sentence.

====Intransitive verbs – Onovergankelijke werkwoorden====
An intransitive verb does not have a direct object

:Hij gaat naar Amerika - he goes to America
:Jij geneest - you get well

Such phrases cannot be transposed into a passive voice construction

Sometimes the same verb can be used as a transitive, that does have a passive:

:Jij genas ''hem'' - you healed him
:Hij werd door jou genezen - he was healed by you.

Another way of making a verb transitive is to prefix be-:

:Ik kijk naar de tekening - I look at the drawing
:Ik bekijk de tekening - I examine the drawing

In Dutch there are really two types of intransitives: ''ergatives'' and ''inergatives''. 

=====Ergatives=====
Ergatives take the auxiliary ''zijn'' in the perfect:

:Jij geneest.
:Jij '''bent''' genezen. - you have healed.

''Genezen'' can also be transitive, but some verbs are only ergatives:

:het vet stolt - the grease solidifies
:het vet is gestold.

Ergatives typically express ''autonomous processes'' that ''happen'' and the typically do not have a clear ''agent''.

The causative auxiliaries ''doen'' en ''laten'' are used to transform ergatives into transitives:

:Ik doe het vet stollen.

Vice versa the auxiliary ''raken'' can be used to create an ergative sentence from an adjective or participle:

:Hij '''raakte''' verwond. - He got wounded.

=====Inergatives=====
Inergatives take the auxiliary ''hebben'' in the perfect. There is a clear agent:

:De hond blaft
:De hond heeft geblaft. 

That darned dog is the culprit!

These verbs are not entirely intransitive, but form an impersonal passive with ''er'':

:Er wordt geblaft - There is barking.
:Er is gebeld - Somebody called.

Transitives, ditransitives and inergatives all have one thing in common: they are ''verbs of action''. Usually there is a clear ''agent''. In the passive this agent is indicated by using the preposition ''door'':

:Er is niet ''door hem'' gebeld - There were no phone calls from him.

====Reflexive verbs – Wederkerende werkwoorden====
In a sense, reflexive verbs are intermediary between active and passive. Their subjects equal their direct objects. In Dutch they are accompanied by the reflexive pronoun ''zich'' in its various forms. 

Verbs can occur both as reflexive and as an ordinary transitive verb, albeit with a different meaning:

:ik herinner me - I remember
:dat herinnert me aan.. - this reminds me of..

Others occur only in reflexive form:

:zich gedragen - to behave
:hij wist zich niet te gedragen - he did not know how to behave
:zich vermannen - to pull oneself together (''lit''. to make oneself a man)

Reflexive verbs do not have a passive voice, but they can have a second direct object besides the reflexive pronoun:

:hij herinnerde zich dat.

''Zich'' is a relatively recent loan from German -Afrikaans does not have it e.g.- and only used for the third person and occasionally together with ''u''. The other reflexives are identical to the object forms of the personal pronouns.

It is possible to add -zelf to a reflexive pronoun to make the reflexive relationship more emphatic. Thus ''I wash myself'' can be expressed with four subtle degrees of emphasis:

: ik was me -- I'm washing not dressing e.g.
: ik was ''mij'' -- I don't wash you
: ik was me''zelf'' -- You don't wash me
: ik was ''mijzelf'' -- I neither wash you nor do you touch me: buzz off!

The addition of -zelf is only possible if the verb is ''optionally reflexive''. E.g. you can also wash ''someone else''. If the reflexiveness is mandatory forms with -zelf are not possible.

====Auxiliary verbs - Hulpwerkwoorden====
Auxiliary verbs are used to form the various compound tenses and voices of the verb. In Dutch they are:

:''hebben'': forms active perfect tenses
:''zijn'': forms active perfect tenses of some verbs and passive perfect tenses of transitive verbs
:''worden'': forms passive imperfect tenses
:''zullen'': forms the future tenses

Occasionally ''gaan'' is used for immediate future constructions. 

In contrast to English ''to do'' the verb ''doen'' is not used as an auxiliary, although there are expressions like:

:hoop doet leven - ''lit''. 'hope makes one to live' - where there is hope there is life
:dit doet vermoeden dat... - this makes one suspect that...

====Modal verbs – Modale werkwoorden====
Modal verbs are closely related to auxiliary verbs. They are verbs like ''kunnen'', ''moeten'' and ''mogen''

:ik kan komen - I can come, I am able to come
:ik zou kunnen komen - I would be able to come

In the latter case the word order is a bit more restricted in dependent clauses:

:ik wist dat ik komen kon 
:ik zei dat ik kon komen

are both possible, but:

:ik zei dat ik zou kunnen komen

In this case it is unusual to put ''zou'' at the end

====Impersonal verbs – Onpersoonlijke werkwoorden====
Some verbs only occur in the third person singular with the neuter personal pronoun ''het''. Weather phenomena are a good example:

:het regent - it rains
:het sneeuwt - it is snowing
:het dooit - it is thawing
:het waait - the wind blows

Impersonal verbs are not limited to the weather:

:het spijt me - I'm sorry

Impersonals always take ''hebben'':

:het heeft gewaaid
:het heeft me gespeten.

====Copulas – Koppelwerkwoorden====
Copulas couple two concepts, the ''subject'' and what in Dutch is known as ''het naamwoordelijk deel van het gezegde'', the nominal part of the compound verb. The ''naamwoordelijk deel'' can be either ''zelfstandig'' or ''bijvoeglijk''. The most common copula is '''''zijn''''' (''to be''):

:Jan is piloot
:Jan is sterk

''Worden'' can be used as a copula in Dutch, corrsponding to ''to become'':

:Jan wordt piloot

There is a few more copulas such as:

:blijven: dit blijft moeilijk – this remains difficult
:lijken: dit lijkt mooi  - this seems beautiful
:blijken: dit bleek onmogelijk – this proved impossible
:schijnen: het scheen eenvoudig – it appeared easy

==The four contrasts of the verb==

===Indicative mood===

The forms of the Dutch verb in the indicative mood are determined by the four contrasts:

# is the action ''now'' or in the ''past'' (tegenwoordig - verleden)
# is the action ''finished'' or ''not'' (onvoltooid - voltooid)
# is the action ''real'' or ''predicted / hypothetical'' (niet toekomend - toekomend)
# is the action ''performed'' by or ''applied'' to the subject (bedrijvend - lijdend)

The first contrast is rendered synthetically, the other three require auxiliary verbs:

# -
# ''hebben'' or ''zijn''
# ''zullen''
# ''worden''

The contrasts can be combined freely. This leads to 2x2x2x2 = 16 forms for a transitive verb, for an intransitive one the passive voice (contrast 4) does not apply and there are 8 forms.

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;| (niet toekomend) !!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| toekomend 
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| !! tegenwoordig!! verleden!! tegenwoordig!! verleden
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''bedrijvend'''||'''onvoltooid'''||ik zie||ik zag||ik zal zien||ik zou zien
|-
|'''voltooid'''||ik heb gezien||ik had gezien||ik zal gezien hebben||ik zou gezien hebben
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''lijdend'''||'''onvoltooid'''||ik word gezien||ik werd gezien||ik zal gezien worden||ik zou gezien worden
|-
|'''voltooid'''||ik ben gezien||ik was gezien||ik zal gezien zijn||ik zou gezien zijn
|}

Note that in the prefect passive tenses ''worden'' takes ''zijn'' as its auxiliary. In the passive voice construction its past participle ''geworden'' is typically omitted, rendering ''zijn'' the auxiliary of the perfect passive by default.

In Dutch the tenses are indicated by their contrasts, e.g. ''ik zou gezien zijn'' is de ''voltooid verleden toekomende tijd van de lijdende vorm''. As this nomenclature leads to rather lengthy names it is usual to use an acronym: '''''vvtt''' van de lijdende vorm''

Notice that in Dutch grammar the ''past future tenses'' replace what is known in other grammars as the ''conditional (mood)''. It is thought of as a future tense uttered in the past:

: Yesterday I said: ''&quot;he will come&quot;'' =&gt; yesterday I said that he '''''would come'''''.

===Infinitive mood===

In the infinitive mood the present-past contrast is missing:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| !! (niet toekomend) !!toekomend 
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''bedrijvend'''||'''onvoltooid'''||zien||zullen zien
|-
|'''voltooid'''||gezien hebben||gezien zullen hebben
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;| '''lijdend'''||'''onvoltooid'''||gezien worden||gezien zullen worden
|-
|'''voltooid'''||gezien zijn||gezien zullen zijn
|}

Compound infinitives are rather more prominent in Dutch than in English, especially in combination with the particle ''te'':

: Hij was bang door de wachters ''gezien te zullen worden''
::: He was afraid that he would be seen by the guards
: Na hem ''gezien te hebben'' sloegen zij alarm
::: After they had spotted him they sounded the alarm

Notice that in the latter example the infinitive is part of an adverbial expression of time, using the preposition ''na'', but that it still carries a direct object: ''hem''. In the first example the compound infinitive is accompanied by a prepositional object ''door de wachters''. Infinitives thus do function as verbs in Dutch. They allow their action to be encapsulated inside another sentence without putting the action in a separate clause starting with a relative pronoun (that, who etc.)  or a conjunction (after, because etc.)

===Subjunctive and imperative moods===

The other two moods are far more limited. There is usually only one form in the active present. For the imperative that is the second person singular, for the -all but extinct- subjunctive the third person singular. 

====Subjunctive====
For the subjunctive mood, only a few forms have managed to survive. 

: &lt;u&gt;Leve&lt;/u&gt; de koning! Dat hij lang &lt;u&gt;moge&lt;/u&gt; leven! 
::: Long live the king! May he live long! 
: Wat de reden dan ook &lt;u&gt;zij&lt;/u&gt;, je moet je huiswerk afhebben. 
::: Whatever the reason be, you must have your homework done. 
: Ik zou eerder zijn gekomen, &lt;u&gt;ware&lt;/u&gt; het niet voor het slechte verkeer. 
::: I would have come earlier, had it not been for the bad traffic. 

The subjunctive has now rather more disappeared over time, and isn't practiced any longer. Only a few fossiled expressions remain. The past tense of this mood in particular has been replaced by the forms of the indicative past. Sentences that start with an inversion followed by the adverb ''maar'' are a remnant:

:'''Was''' je maar gekomen!  -- If only you had come! (not: ''*Ware'' je maar gekomen)
:'''Gaf''' hij maar een teken van leven!  -- If only he gave a sign that he's alive! (not: ''*Gave hij maar ..'')

====Imperative====
The most common imperative is, much as in English the stem of the verb:

:Help! -- Help!
:Kom! -- Come!

The verb ''zijn'' has a special form, ''wees'':

:Wees stil! -- Be quiet!

Imperatives are often modified with modal particles like ''maar'' or ''toch''.&lt;br&gt; ''Maar'' softens the command to a friendly invitation
:Kom maar!  -- Come! Don't be shy! It's all right!
''Toch'' expresses impatience:
:Kom toch! -- Come! You are waiting for you! Come already!

''Kom toch!'' also expresses disbelief: ''oh, come on.. seriously?''

There exists an archaic plural that takes -t:

:Staakt!  -- Strike!

It went out of fashion around the middle of the 20st century, but can still be seen in older literature.

There is also an imperative of the plusquamperfect, often used with the adverb ''toch''. It expresses disapproval of an earlier chosen course of action:

:'''Had''' toch even '''gebeld'''! - You should have called!
:'''Was''' toch naar ons toe '''gekomen'''!  - Why on earth didn't you come to us?!

I would add content about how to publish free webcomics in free websites. --[[User:212.166.246.156|212.166.246.156]] 15:36, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

this whole book is misinformed

comics are not all about being &quot;funny&quot;. If you have not read the &quot;Maus&quot; series by Art Spiegelman, or dealt with true artistry in comics and graphic novels, then don't be adding garbage to this.
the last thing we need is more people reinforcing myths about comics.
the Creative Writing/Comics wikibook has got things straight.
i will modify this book if i ever get time.

==Restructuring and Rewriting==
I'm hoping to have time to restructure and rewrite this book, which is obviously not very good. If anyone has any suggestions, drop them here. I'm not an expert on the subject.[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|talk]]) 02:08, 20 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

= Dutch Defence =
===1...f5===
Black's opening move aims to transpose into a Dutch Defence. [[/2. d4|d4]] gives a main-line Dutch, while [[/2. c4|c4]] and [[/2. g3|g3]] reserve options.

A major independent option is [[/2. e4|e4]]. The sacrifice of White's e-pawn is borrowed from the [[../../1. d4/1...f5/2. e4|Staunton Gambit]], but the positional themes are very different since here White's king's knight can reach g5.

[[/2. d3|d3]] is a way of preparing e4.

== Listbox filtering ==

Take a look on above table and try to remember it. Above data will be used to explain some nice types of lixtbox filtering.

=== Simple filtering ===

You may filter by using full values of given columns. If you'd type '''Sale Invoice Transaction''' in ''Portal Type'' column then only object ''003'' would be shown.

'''%''' sign may be used as part of word. If you'd type '''Sale%''' in '''Portal Type''' column, then objects '''001''' and '''003''' would be shown.

Using this types of filtering - which may apply on any columns and types is almost enough.

=== Complex filtering ===
==== Date ranges ====

You may use two operators to define date range - '''&gt;=''' which is mean ''after this date, including it'' and '''&lt;=''' - ''before this date, including it''. When '''Start Date''' would be set to '''&gt;= 2007/10/11''' then objects '''001''' and '''004''' would be shown. When it'd set to '''&lt;=2006/10/11'''  objects '''002''' and '''003''' would be shown.

==== Not operator ====

If you'd type '''!=Draft''' in '''Simulation State''' column, then objects '''002''', '''003''' and '''004''' would be shown. Note, that you might not have any space after not operator '''!=''' - '''!= Draft''' won't work.


== Domain Tree ==

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Erp5_domain_button.png]]&lt;/span&gt;

If the listbox has a domain root defined, it will display this icon - when you click on it, the listbox will enter a &quot;domain tree mode&quot;. Then you can select a base category from the dropdown that appears to the left of the listbox.



&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Erp5_domain_tree.png]]&lt;/span&gt;

When you select a base category (like Region), the listbox will present an expandable tree of all regions that are defined in the system. When you click on any of them, the listbox will show only these people that live in this region (or in any sub-region). Here, we selected Europe/Poland/Mazowieckie region, and we see everyone who lives in Siedlce or Warszawa.

&lt;pre&gt;
TODO: show accounting listbox with count/sum 
feature in domain tree mode
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
TODO: Report tree ???
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;/&gt;

=Lisitsin Gambit=
2. e4 is a very counter-intuitive move, as after the pawn is captured White does not get to make a developing move but must move an already developed piece again. However, practice has shown that the knight landing on g5 is hard to chase away and creates certain tactical threats (more than simply Nxe4!) that compensate for the lost pawn.

[[/2...fxe4|2...fxe4]] is the only way to challenge White's idea. 
&quot;The way to refute a gambit is to accept it.&quot; - Wilhelm Steinitz

[[../../../1. e4/1...e5/2. Nf3/2...f5|2...e5]] transposes to the notorious Latvian Gambit. This may actually be a good practical choice for someone who knows nothing about the Lisitsin, as it gives Black a greater initiative.

== Lisitsin Gambit ==
Black logically accepted White's gambit and is now attacking White's f3-knight. By far the best move to save it is [[/3. Ng5|3. Ng5]]. On d4 or e5 it can be kicked by pawns, on h4 it does nothing (as long as Black is wary of a Qh5 check) but on g5 it forces Black to defend her e4-pawn.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Before you begin, have a plan. Do some rough sketches and layout ideas before you jump head first into your final page. You want to try to solve as many problems as possible to avoid them while they are still easy to fix. 
*Check your spelling! Have a dictionary or [[w:word processor|word processor]] handy if you are not sure. You may also try typing your dialogue into a word processor or other computer program that has a spell-check feature. 
*Run your ideas by another person. Sometimes a second (or third, or fourth, etc.) outside opinion can shed light on problems you didn't see, or provide suggestions that can make your comic even better. Sometimes you can get so involved in making it, it is easy to miss even the simplest things. 
*Draw what you draw best. It's much easier and relaxing than struggling with things you haven't tried drawing before. (Then again, it is important to push yourself in order to get better.)
*You can make your comic as intricate or as simple as you please, you are the creator of it after all.
*And most importantly have fun , its no use trying to make a comic book and not enjoying the process. 
*Get comic creating!

      <text xml:space="preserve">In comics, one is not limited to the kinds of stories they can tell. Wether one wishes to create a one page story about their pet dog Buster, or create a multi-volume space saga, knowing the basics of a narrative structure can help you tell your stories in a more organized, interesting way. 
The narrative structure is typically broken down into five parts, which are:
* Exposition
* Rising Action
* Climax
* Falling Action
* Resolution

==== Exposition ====
Exposition is where main characters are introduced, setting is defined and the goals and desires of the characters are introduced.

==== Rising Action ====
After the main characters motivations are defined in some way, and they usually begin to work towards them at this point. Smaller problems and situations will happen here. Usually this means that another character or force is stopping the protagonist from reaching his goal.

==== Climax ====
It is here where the main character is ready to achieve his actual goal, or is ready to fight the antagonist. In a story, this is the most dramatic part, 

==== Falling Action ====
==== Resolution ====

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Draw a circle. 
*Draw a light vertical line at the center of the circle. 
*Make light horizontal dashes a little above the center of the circle. 
*Draw another light horizontal line just below the dashed lines. 
*Draw the jaw-line of your character at the bottom half of the circle. Where it meets at the center vertical line it should basically look like a big &quot;V&quot; in the end. 
*Draw two vertical lines at the base of the jaw to make the neck. 
*Add the eyes at the horizontal line with the eyebrows going up to the dashed horizontal line. 
*To draw the eyes, make a half-oval shape. Then draw a horizontal line underneath the oval. Place a black dot in the middle for the pupils. 
*Make your nose along the vertical line and end with the mouth just below it. 
*To draw the nose, draw a slanted line going down to the right, then draw another smaller slanted line going down to the left. *Nostrils are generally triangular shaped. 
*Draw the ears as high as the dashed line and about as low as the nose. 
*To draw the ears, make half-oval shapes on the side of the head. 
*Make the hairline above the dashed line to show were the hair stops. You can make the hair however you want. 
*Trace over the head with a pen if you wish. 
*Erase any extra lines, and you now have a human head.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Learning Management systems (LMS) such as [http://www.blackboard.com/us/index.Bb Blackboard] and [http://moodle.org/ Moodle] are excellent tools that can be used in the K-12 classroom to promote the school and its curriculum.

'''Benefits to Students and Parents'''

A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Management_System learning management system] allows students to download and upload files, participate in chat and discussion boards, as well as take assessments. Students are also able to view grades as well as contact the teacher and classmates. An LMS is a step above a classroom website which is a more static approach to giving classroom information. These systems utilize tools similar to those that tech savy students already use outside of the classroom. Although most educators think of an LMS as being limited to older students it can help younger students in the elementary grades to organize their work while simultaneously keeping parents in tune with what is going on in the classroom. An LMS allows teachers to tutor and build skills by placing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object reusable learning objects], documents, video, practice exercises, and assessments on the system. Using an LMS allows parents to review the course curriculum, classroom calendar and monitor their student's progress. If the instructor posts samples of student work and rubrics, students and parents can see how other classmates are performing and have a clearer idea of academic expectations. The use of a learning management system gives the teacher the opportunity to promote classroom activities and course expectations. However, once an LMS is implemented there is pressure on the instructor to keep the content up to date and located in such a way as to be easily found by the students and parents. Once parents and students have ready access to certain information, for example grades, that information must be kept up to date. An LMS system also allows for distance learning for students that are out of school due to illness or suspension.


'''Benefits to Teachers'''

The use of a learning management system also allows for teacher collaboration at grade level or by subject in the design of learning objects to post on the system. Given proper planning time teachers can design thematic units using reuseable learning objects and perscriptive activities for groups of students based on test data. The Amarillo Independent School District in Texas uses the Blackboard learning management system with a set of add-ons to support teacher collaboration and curriculum development.(Waters,2007) This allows teachers across the district to work independently and contribute to the team effort asynchronously without having to attend district wide meetings.

== Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis ==
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is a very common method of gel electrophoresis for separating proteins by mass. SDS-PAGE was first known as the Laemmli method, after its inventor, U.K. Laemmli. The key component of this technique happens before proteins are electrophoresed; they are denatured in a detergent called sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). SDS denatures proteins by binding to the hydrophobic core of the protein, and gives each protein a negative charge proportionate to its mass. SDS binds to the protein in a ratio of approximately 1.4 grams of SDS per 1.0 g of protein, but can vary from 1.1-2.2 grams of SDS per gram of protein {{ref|SDS}}. The proteins may be further treated with reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol (DTT), to break any reformed disulfide bonds, and then alkylated with iodoacetamide to prevent further reformation of disulfide bonds.

The end result of this process is that the denatured proteins become linear, so that all proteins have similar structure and can be separated according to their molecular weight. Unlike conventional gel electrophoresis, where proteins would need to be broken into linear chunks for analysis, SDS-PAGE allows for analysis of the entire protein.

For further details on gels, staining, and electrophoretic analysis, see the &quot;Gel Electrophoresis&quot; section of this chapter.
[[File:SDS-PAGE.jpg|thumb|230px|Picture of an SDS-PAGE. The molecular marker is in the left lane]]

== Isoelectric Focusing ==
In isoelectric focusing (IEF), proteins are separated by an electric current that passes through a gel containing a pH gradient.  A protein's charge depends on the charge of its amino acid side chains.  These charges change with pH.  A protein will move through the pH gradient until its charge is zero since neutral molecules are not attracted to either the cathode or anode.  The pH at which the protein is neutral is called the isoelectric point.

Immobilized pH gradients (IPGs) are used for IEF because the fixed pH gradients remain stable, even at very high voltages, for a long time. Buffering compounds are used to create the pH gradients of IPGs. IPGs are cast strips of gel with plastic backing sheets, and are commercially available in different pH ranges and lengths. They offer high resolution, great reproducibility, and allow high protein loads. {{ref|IEF2}} Isoelectric focusing is run in the same solutions that are used to extract or solubilize the proteins.

IPG strips loaded with protein must be rehydrated in rehydration/sample buffer. Rehydration can be active or passive. To load larger proteins, a small voltage is applied, causing active rehydration. After electrophoresis is complete, the focused strips can be frozen for storage.

== Native-PAGE ==
Native-PAGE is used to separate proteins in their native states, according to differences in their charge density. The native state of a protein is its properly folded state, not denatured or unfolded. It is important in Native-PAGE that there be no denaturants present in the gel or buffer. Otherwise, proteins will not maintain their native state. Many proteins are shown to be enzymatically active after separation by native PAGE. Thus, it is used for preparation of purified and active proteins. Native-PAGE can be carried out near neutral pH to prevent denaturation by acids and bases; it is useful to study individual conformations, as well as aggregation or self-associations. Denaturation and proteolysis is further reduced by keeping the apparatus and sample cold. {{ref|Native}}

The mobility of proteins depends both on their charge and size. The amino acid composition and post-translational modifications of any particular protein determines its charge. Smaller proteins or those with higher charge move farther during electrophoresis than larger proteins or those with less charge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What You Need==
* Small flathead screwdriver - This is used to pop off the faceplate edges
* Electrical Tape - This is used to prevent scratching
* Ford Key - This is used to ''pop'' the stereo out
** Don't have one? don't worry, you can easily [[#Building A Key|build one]]

==Steps==
# Take the screwdriver and wrap the tip with a single layer of electrical tape
#* Make sure that your screwdriver is thin enough to fit between the edge and the trimming
# Stick the screw driver in between the faceplate edge and the trimming and pry off the edges
#* This should not take much force, I found best results when prying from the top and bottom
#* If you do not have the tape player or the MD then do this for the small plate as well
# Use the ford key by sticking it into the hole and the slot as shown
*Note: The photo shows the key in the middle and lower holes, but the key must be used in the upper and lower holes.*
#* If you only have two keys, do one side first then the other side next
# Now pull the radio out while applying force on the keys towards the door
#* If you removed the small plate, this should be pretty easy, if not you will have to be creative
# Tada! your factory stereo has now been removed.  Just unplug and do what you want with it.

==Building A Key==
All you need to build your own set of keys is a metal coat hanger and some tools&lt;br/&gt;
I used a Dremel to do the work, but I'm sure there are many other ways to go about building the key
* Measure the bottom of the coat hanger into four approximately equal sized pieces
* Use the Dremel (with a sandpaper disc) to cut the coat hanger at the leftmost and rightmost edges
** You should end up with a piece falling off from the middle
* Now try and cut the hanger again so that you will have a U-shaped ''key'' with segments of equal length
* finally, sand down the sharp edges and taper the points on one side
* for the straight piece that you cut first, you can either use this to build another (just use pliers to fold it into a U) or you can toss it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't think the AuxMod has seen any development recently, I don't even know if it is still being used by anyone.  But for the sake of argument, here is the information about the mod.

==Explanation==
* AuxMod is a circuit board that connects to your factory stereo and makes use of the Tape/MD player
* It converts the Tape/MD player to an input port (3.5mm RCA mini)
* With this input port you can play mp3 players or anything that has a standard headphone port through the factory stereo
* Successfully tested with the RX-8, Mazda6, Mazda5, Mazda3, Miata, MPV, Tribute and Mazda2 (according to the website)
** I believe Protege 5 has been successfully tested, although no ''official'' word from the developer

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|Cuisine of the United States]] | [[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]

'''Switchel''', also known as '''Ginger Water''' or '''Haymaker's Punch''', is a sweetened beverage made from ground [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]], [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|apple cider vinegar]], sugar or other sweeteners and water.  It is a traditional drink on farms in the north eastern United States, where it was made to soothe the thirsts of farm workers as well as (allegedly) boost one's stamina. It is served chilled, but is often served warmed in the Winter months.

==Ingredients==
Recipe 1:
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|apple cider vinegar]]
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Ginger|ground ginger]]
*1 quart [[Cookbook:Water|water]]

Recipe 2:
*3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]]
*2/3 cup apple cider vinegar
*1 heaping teaspoon ground ginger
*1 gallon Water

==Procedure==

# Dissolve sugar and ground ginger in the water.
# Stir in the apple cider vinegar
# Chill or serve over ice cubes. Shake well before serving.

==Variations==

Some traditional recipes have used [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] and/or [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]], separately or in combination, as sweeteners. The ratio of sweetener and vinegar to water vary widely in traditional and modern recipes. A small amount of [[Cookbook:Oatmeal|oatmeal]] is sometimes added to give the beverage more body and to add to the flavor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For Help Topics, press F1.

== Tools ==
=== Select (S)===
Press S to cycle between the four selectors:&lt;br&gt;
*Rectangle Select&lt;br&gt;
*Ellipse Select&lt;br&gt;
*Lasso Select&lt;br&gt;
*Magic Wand&lt;br&gt;
Brief Descriptions of each:&lt;br&gt;
'''Rectangle Select''' selects a rectangle. Drag from one corner to the opposite corner to draw. Hold Shift to keep it as a Square.&lt;br&gt;
'''Ellipse Select''' selects a Circle/Oval. Drag like a rectangle, and it will draw a circle which touches each side. Hold in Shift to keep it as a Circle.&lt;br&gt;
'''Lasso Select''' draws a shape and selects it dynamically. Just draw any old shape.&lt;br&gt;
'''Magic Wand''' is, well... magical. Click on a pixel of one color and it will select all pixels adjoining that one of the same or similar color, then do the same on each pixel selected in this manner.&lt;br&gt;
=== Paint Bucket ===
Just click wherever and it will fill with your primary color. Right-Click to fill with your alternate color.&lt;br&gt;
=== Paintbrush (B) ===
Click and drag to draw a line of specified thickness.&lt;br&gt;
=== Pencil (P) ===
Just like the Paintbrush, but it only has a thickness of 1 pixel.&lt;br&gt;
=== Clone Stamp (L) ===
Copies one part of the image to another part of the image, selected as circles. &lt;br&gt;
=== Text (T) ===
Click to create a text box. Type text in said text box, and use the Nub (Square with four arrows on) to move it around by dragging.&lt;br&gt;
=== Shapes (O) ===
Use O to cycle between the five different parts of the Shape tool.
*Rectangle
*Ellipse
*Rounded Rectangle
*Freeform Shape
*Lines/Curves
A brief description of each:&lt;br&gt;
The '''Rectangle''' draws a rectangle. You can make it draw a rectangle border, solid rectangle or solid rectangle with border. Hold Shift to keep it square.&lt;br&gt;
The '''Ellipse''' draws a circle or oval, like the Ellipse Select tool. As with the Rectangle tool, you can hold shift to keep it circular, and you can draw a border, solid shape or solid shape with border.&lt;br&gt;
The '''Rounded Rectangle''' draws a rectangle with rounded corners. It is identical in every respect to the Rectangle tool.&lt;br&gt;
The '''Freeform Shape''' tool is like the Lasso Select. It is also like the Rectangle tool. You can choose to draw a border, a solid shape or a solid shape with a border.&lt;br&gt;
'''Lines/Curves''' is used to draw a straight line. Then, you can drag the four handles on the line around to bend the line to your will.&lt;br&gt;
=== Color Replacer (R)===
Replaces your alternate color with your primary color, and leaves other colors alone.&lt;br&gt;
=== Eyedropper (P)===
Click on a pixel to replace your primary color with the color of the pixel you clicked on. Simple enough. 
Right click to change your alternate color.&lt;br&gt;
=== Eraser (E) ===
Fades all the pixels in the area of its effect to nothing, on the current layer.&lt;br&gt;
=== Gradient (G) ===
Click at one point and drag to another. Having done that, it should be quite obvious.&lt;br&gt;
=== Pan (H) ===
While zoomed in, use this tool to drag your way around the image.&lt;br&gt;
=== Zoom (Z) ===
Left click to zoom in, right click to zoom out.&lt;br&gt;
=== Move (M) ===
Use M to cycle between the two move tools.&lt;br&gt;
*Move Selection
*Move Selected Pixels
A brief description of each:&lt;br&gt;
'''Move Selection''' moves only your selected area. You can drag your selection circle all over the image and it will not affect the image in any way.&lt;br&gt;
'''Move Selected Pixels''' moves the pixels you have selected on the current layer. So if you select a 10x10 square on layer A, then drag it 20 to the right, it will move that square on layer A but on layer B it will do nothing.&lt;br&gt;

'''INTRODUCTION:'''

In this [http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/biotech/microarray/ excellent Flash application from learn.genetics] (Utah university), students are introduced to the 'new' science of genomics and are shown how a DNA microarray works. Thay are then instructed to carry out a virtual microarray that illustrates the genetic difference between a healthy skin cell and a melanoma cell. Students can use this task as a means to learn about genomics and the use of reverse transcriptase and to revise protein synthesis. 
 




'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:''' 

* DNA Microarray virtual lab from [http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/biotech/microarray/]

* Teacher-set questions

*
*
*
*
*


OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED: 

* Individual access to computers is beneficial

* Internet connection

* Macromedia Flah Player (latest version)




'''INSTRUCTIONS:''' 

* Send students to the learn.genetics homepage and ask them to find the DNA microarray in the virtual labs section. 

* Students complete the microarray learning excercise individually. 




'''SAMPLE QUESTIONS'''

* What is the main difference between Genetics and Genomics? (scale of work and time consumption)

* Which of the following statements are true?

** An erythrocyte and a skin cell in the same body contain the same DNA. (T)

** Different genes are expressed in different cell types within the same organism. (T)

** Gene expression can be observed as production of tRNA. (F - mRNA)

** Each spot on a Microarray represents one gene. (T)

** A cancer cell will express most of the same genes as a healthy cell. (T)

** Reverse transcriptase makes a new strand of RNA. (F - it makes copy DNA (cDNA))

* Produce a flow-chart of the process of a microarray

* If a gene is not expressed, what would you expect to see on a microarray scan? 
** green marker 
** red marker
** yellow marker
** no marker       (T)

'''INTRODUCTION:''' 

Made in 1992, this true story is based on the life of Lorenzo Odone, a young boy diagnosed with the progressive neurological disease [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenoleukodystrophy adrenoleukodystrophy]. Starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon, it tells the story of Lorenzo's parents as they struggle to make Lorenzo's life comfortable whilst also generating groundbreaking research into this 'orphan' disease. Their research led to the development of Lorenzo's oil, an olive-oil based food supplement that can prevent the onset of ALD in boys diagnosed with the disease. Lorenzo lived until May 30, 2008, one day after his 30th birthday. 


Students will watch the movie, answering a series of questions that tie the movie to the DP Biology syllabus. 





'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:''' 

* Lorenzo's Oil DVD or video 

* Question sheet, available from (occ link)
*
*
*
*
*
&lt;BR&gt;

'''USEFUL INFORMATION'''

* ALD is a progressive, sex-linked neurological disorder - it is only passed from mothers to sons and is carried on the X-chromosome. (Although there is an ALD-related gene on another chromosome, this may confuse students). 

* ALD is a build-up of long-chain fatty acids (C24-C26) which damage the myelin sheath of nerve cells. As this progresses, patients lose motor function and eventually become paralysed, requiring a ventilator and saliva-suction. 

* Symptoms are shown in young boys, which get progressively worse. Death is usually before age 12. 

* A C24-C26 limited diet was found to increase levels of C24-C26 fatty acids in some patients, due to increased biosynthesis of the same dangerous molecules. 

* C18, toxic to humans in pure form, can reduce C24-C26 when used to 'flood the system'. It is found in olive oil. 

* 'Lorenzo's oil' is a C18-rich oil. This can be produced by either removing the C24-C26 chains from olive oil, or by using C18 chains to make triglycerides. This is very expensive. 

*Some boys given Lorenzo's oil before they show symptoms remain ALD-free. 

* The Odone family's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo%27s_oil Myelin Project] aims to develop research into remyelination of damaged nerve cells, with the eventual goal of reversing some of the progress of ALD. 

&lt;BR&gt;

----


'''IDEAS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION'''

* Discuss: as more boys survive into adulthood, will it become possible for girls to develop ALD? 

* Genetic screening and 'designer babies' - if the mother is a known carrier, do students' points of view on their rights change?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MENSTRUAL CYCLE ANIMATION TASK ==

'''TEACHING OBJECTIVE:''' 
* Produce an animation to illustrate the menstrual cycle

'''TASK OUTCOMES:''' 
* By the end of this activity, students will be able to explain the menstrual cycle using Flash animation. 

'''TIME REQUIRED:''' 
* ongoing project

----

'''INTRODUCTION:''' 
Many students by now have ICT skills that surpass those of their teachers and seem to love fiddling with animations. 
This task takes a fairly dull topic and allows them to produce a resource that could be used in middle-school health classes or as a simple revision tool for later on. 




'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:''' 

* Macromedia Flash Professional (or other animation software)

* 1 computer per student or pair

* 
*
*
*
*


OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED: 

* text or revision guide

* input from counsellor if the results are to be used for middle-school education

*



'''INSTRUCTIONS:''' 

* If all students in the class are strong on animation, work solo. 

* If some have limited ICT skills, pair them with stronger members of the class. They can split the research/ animating elements of the task between them. 

* Agree as a class on a time limit for the project - 2 weeks may be sufficient. If students have their own laptops, you may want to give up a few lessons for the project. 

* Define the task clearly. At minimum, SL content must be covered effectively. HL students may want to add in extra detail, as either an option in their animation (selected from a menu), or as a more advanced presentation that would probably be insuitable for middle-school use but may be used for DP revision. 

* Personally, I prefer that information is clear, not copied, and not too wordy. Animations are supposed to make learning more simple, not confuse the issue! 

* I also prefer that students don't include any overpowering soundtrack, especially death-metal or happy-hardcore rave tunes, as this distracts from the point of the animation. Needless to say, they still do it. 

* Emphasise substance over style. 

* 
*
*


'''SAFETY/ RISK ASSESSMENT'''

* In some cultures, parents may need to give approval before students are shown materials of this nature. 

* Censor content before it is shown to younger students - be especially vigilant with errors or misconceptions that may lead students into poor life choices. 

*


----


'''IDEAS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION'''

* This could be used as part of a parents' education day, or in a school health symposium. 

* The task could be easily adapted to most topics in Biology. 

*

      <text xml:space="preserve">== PROTEIN SYNTHESIS RUNNING DICTATION ==



'''TEACHING OBJECTIVE:''' 
* To introduce/ consolidate the processes of transcription/ translation (at Standard Level) through student modelling and a competition. Success depends on students' understanding of the topic. 




'''TASK OUTCOMES:''' 
By the end of this activity, students will be able to: 

* Transcribe and translate a 10-amino-acid polypeptide

* work as a group to build a model of a polypeptide whilst acting as parts of the process. 

* Describe the effects of errors (e.g. base substitution) on the the final product



'''TIME REQUIRED:''' 
* 15 minutes if used for consolidation, up to 30 if used for teaching


----

'''INTRODUCTION:''' 


In this activity, students will work in teams of three to transcribe a DNA sequence and translate it into a polypeptide. 
This challenge is straightforward if explained clearly but can be a headache if not. 
It can be used either as a plenary to consolidate SL protein synthesis, or as a challenging teaching task. 





'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:''' [[Image:Protsyn_run_dic.jpg|right|250px|Instructions Image. remove the answers first!]]
(per group of three)

* LEGO blocks, beads or similar (5 colours, 6 blocks of each)

* genetic code image (included here) - 1 per group

* instructions image, projected on whiteboard (cut off DNA, mRNA and A.A. sequences)

* pen and scrap paper

* poster made up of the DNA sequence, no spaces between triplets. 

* correct answer written down or photographed for checking



OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED: 
* text book or study guide
*
*



'''INSTRUCTIONS:''' [[Image:Translationchart.jpg|right|250px| Genetic Code]]

* split class into groups of three

* put up a large poster of the DNA sequence (unspaced) in the corridor (TCTCAACAATACCGAGCCCTTGCGTCTGCTGCACAATCCACTGCACGA)

* set up one table per group, with a set of blocks inside the classroom

* assign roles for each player: 

** player 1 = RNA POLYMERASE 
*** job: read poster, transcribe to mRNA codons, run into classroom, hand off to player 2. 

** player 2 = tRNA
*** job: translate codons into amino acids and shout out the sequence. Needs genetic code sheet. 

** player 3 = LARGE RIBOSOMAL SUBUNIT
*** job: listen to the sequence, grab the correct blocks and put them in the right order. 

* RULES: 
** player 1 may not help player 2, player 2 may not help player 3
** first team to finish must shout stop 
** teams may not 'edit' their final model

* SCORING: 
** first to finish = 100 points
** second = 90 points
** third = 80 points and so on... 
** each error in the amino acid sequence has a penalty of -10 points. 
** highest scoring team wins (may not necessarily be the fastest)


* If this task is used for teaching for the first time, texts will be required for the group and they should plan their strategy together and make sure all members understand before they start running about. 


* THE SOLUTION: 
** the DNA sequence is TCTCAACAATACCGAGCCCTTGCGTCTGCTGCACAATCCACTGCACGA. 
** this is 48 bases long, but only codes for 10 amino acids. 
** transcription MUST begin at the 'START' codon: TCTCAACAA  '''TACCGAGCCCTTGCGTCTGCTGCACAATCCACT'''  GCACGA 
** it must end at the 'STOP' codon (ACT)
** the mRNA sequence is: AUG - GCU - CGG - GAA - GCG - AGA - CGA - CGU - GUU - AGG - UGA
** this gives the amino acids: MET - ALA - ARG - GLU - ALA - ARG - ARG - ARG - VAL - ARG - STOP



'''SAFETY/ RISK ASSESSMENT'''

* Clear any obstacle out of the way

* Maintain order and force students to walk if necessary

*


----


'''IDEAS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION'''

* Put up an alternate version of the DNA sequence for one team: TCTCAACAATACCGAGCCC'''A'''TGCGTCTGCTGCACAATCCACTGCACGA

** In this version, the fourth triplet in the gene has been changed from 'CTT' to '''CAT'''

** This represents a base substitution mutation, and the resulting amino acid will change from 'glu' to 'val'

** Use this mutation to introduce/ discuss base substituion mutations, with reference to sickle cell anaemia. 

** Can the students spot the source/outcome of the error by themselves? 

* Where groups forgot to begin at the 'START/MET' codon, discuss this error

* With HL students, discuss the effects of base deletion or frame-shift mutations. These may be apparent if they made an error caused by deletion or insertion of a base in the mRNA.

== Effects Menu ==
The effects menu is where all of the different effects will show. Some are packaged with Paint.NET; others must be downloaded and extracted into the Paint.NET\Effects\ folder.
Only the default effects will be dealt with here.

=== Blurs ===
There are six default blurs.

==== Gaussian Blur ====
Gaussian Blur is just your average blurring. Mostly, it is used as a softener to remove overly sharp edges, or pixelation.

==== Median ====
This blur reduces noise. As of  the 3.20 Release, it's  now under 'Noise' instead of 'Blurs'.

==== Motion Blur ====
This blurs the image in a way that makes it look like it is moving in a certain direction.

==== Radial Blur ====
Blurs the image like it is spinning around the center of the image.

==== Unfocus ====
Makes it appear like you are seeing it, but not looking at it. Seeing is believing (Use it and you'll know what I mean).

==== Zoom Blur ====
Makes it appear that you are zooming past the image. Once again, seeing is believing.

=== Distort ===
There are four different default distortions.

==== Bulge ====
Bulges the image out at the center. Like a pot belly.

==== Polar Inversion ====
Um. Just use it. I don't think it's really useful.

==== Tile Reflection ====
Sort of cuts it into tiles and makes it look like it's reflecting off those tiles. Looks really cool, please try it.

==== Twist ====
Could be a KoRn song.
Twists your image around the center. The maximum value is 100, which is NOT 100 degrees.

== Effects Menu II ==
The effects after the popouts.

=== Add Noise ===
Creates a static effect. The intensity is the amount of static, and the saturation is how color-ish it is.

=== Clouds ===
Creates clouds using your primary and secondary colors. How simple and self-explanatory.

=== Edge Detect ===
Detects edges and colours the edges in various colours, the inside is then coloured black.

=== Emboss ===
The good old emboss effect. It... embosses stuff. Somewhat self-descriptive.

=== Frosted Glass ===
Have YOU ever looked through Frosted Glass? It makes stuff look like your looking at it through a layer of Frosted Glass.

=== Glow ===
Lets you have a glow on an image.

=== Oil Painting ===
Makes it look like an Oil Painting.

=== Outline ===
Takes every pixel in the whole image, then adds an outline onto it.

=== Pencil Sketch ===
Makes the whole image look like a Pencil Sketch. Very effective, but only black and white.

=== Pixelate ===
Expands the pixels in a similar fashion to the zoom tool in MSPaint.

=== Red Eye Removal ===
Only put this here to make sure you know it exists. It really needs no explaining.

=== Relief ===
Makes the image a relief of itself. Think of it as making your image 3D, then making it look really bad.

=== Sharpen ===
Think unblurring, but ineffective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== DIFFUSION AND OSMOSIS MAGIC SHOW ==


'''TEACHING OBJECTIVE:''' 
* Students will find their own demonstrations of diffusion and osmosis in action and put on a 'magic show' (fun demonstration) for younger students. This may form part of a science fair or school open day. 



'''TASK OUTCOMES:''' 
* By the end of this activity, students will be able to: 
** differentiate between diffusion and osmosis
** explain the processes of diffusion and osmosis clearly to others
** demonstrate diffusion and osmosis using visual displays
** order appropriate equipment and completing risk assessments



'''TIME REQUIRED:''' 
* 1-2 lessons prep time, 1 lesson as 'the show' 

----

'''INTRODUCTION:''' 
Diffusion and osmosis lend themselves to visual demonstration and are pretty simple, so why should we have all the fun (and do all the work)? As the 'membranes' topic falls early in the course, this is an ideal opportunity for students to develop independent research and practical investigation skills - they will be required to find out about their own demonstration, order their own equipment and complete risk assessments. 




'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:''' 

* Groups will be responsible for researching their own demonstrations and thus will be required to order their own materials from the lab technician or find them by themselves. 

*
*
*
*
*
*


OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED: 

* A cooperative lab tech

* texts/ study guides

* internet access



'''INSTRUCTIONS:''' 

* Divide the class into groups of 2 or 3

* Each group must put on a demonstration of 2 or more visual stunts that accurately and entertainingly illustrate the processes of osmosis and diffusion. 

* Students will be given the task and time to research. 

* They must order all materials from the lab tech at least one week before the performance. 

* All groups must practice their 'show' before the real thing - give up one lesson for this. 

* For each demonstration performed, groups should produce a large, clear and accurate poster that explains what happens. 

* Try to minimise the number of 'overlapping' demonstrations. Some ideas include: 
** The osmosis egg
** diffusion of dyes in water
** stink bombs/ thunderpants
** hairdryers, big box and loads of ping-pong balls bouncing about

* Imagination and accuracy are key to success. 



'''SAFETY/ RISK ASSESSMENT''' 

* Each group should complete a risk assessment when ordering materials

* Monitor demonstrations carefully and insist on safety first
*


----


'''IDEAS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION'''

* Students should take this basic knowledge and build on it with active transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MODELLING THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM ==

'''TEACHING OBJECTIVE:''' 
* To demonstrate and explain the basic steps in digestion

'''TASK OUTCOMES:''' 
* By the end of this activity, students will be able to explain what happens to food as it makes the journey from the mouth to the anus. 


'''TIME REQUIRED:''' 
* 20 minutes if teacher-led, 1hr if student-led

----

'''INTRODUCTION:''' 
Digestion is simple, gooey and visual with this demonstration activity. 
The teacher can use the image to build a model digestive system to explain the steps 'from food to poo'. 
Alternatively, the teacher can provide the students with the materials needed and set them the task of preparing, practising and presenting the stages of digestion to an audience. In the canteen at lunch time would be a good crowd-pleaser! 




'''MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT:''' [[Image:Model_dig_sys.jpg‎|right|450px|Diagram of the digestive system model]]
(per model produced)

* plastic funnel

* long balloon, end cut off

* rubber glove, one finger chopped

* 30cm hose

* one leg of pantyhose

* large beaker/ bucket

* duct tape, scissors

* 5 sandwich-bag clips or strong clothes pegs

* some (brown) cereal, milk, juice and a spoon



OTHER RESOURCES NEEDED: 


* Texbook/study guide
*
*



'''INSTRUCTIONS:''' 

* TRY IT OUT BEFORE THE LESSON! 

* Having made the model, use it to demonstrate the stages of digestion, beginning with chewing in the mouth (smash up the cereal and juice with a spoon), through to defaecation (squueze out the stool into a beaker). 

* Along the way, use as much detail as relevant to the audience. For DP students, actions at each stage and enzymes used will be beneficial. If students are modelling to younger students, keep it simple and fill the blanks in class. 

* 
*
*
*
*
*
*


'''SAFETY/ RISK ASSESSMENT'''

* Clean up thoroughly

* Do not eat the food (though for an added 'eugh!' factor, you might want to dip younger finger in the 'stool' and taste it)!

* Be careful of food allergies


----


'''IDEAS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION'''

* Video the presentations

* flow-chart the digestive process, including enzymes at each stage

*

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 07:04, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

Hi, I noticed you recently created a few pages for your Nighthawk guide. If you've come from Wikipedia or are new to wikis in general, here at Wikibooks we use a nested naming scheme. All pages inside a book are made within that book using slash convention. I moved your pages (as you will see) to be within the book. Please see the linked policy above which should be able to answer any questions you have about how we create pages here. Reply on my talk page if you have any further issues. Thanks. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:15, 8 April 2007 (UTC)
Thanks for the help.. New on here for about a week. See the changes you have made and the Catagory edit 
.Appreciate the help  Rob

::Hi Rob - can you give me some specific examples - can't see any real problems at a quick glance but I will happily help if I can - cheers --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 15:42, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:::Aaaah I see.  Ok firstly a minor point, new talk page postings always go at bottom of the page - hardly vital but it does make it easier to see the relevant posting when you get the orange bar!

:::Yes I see what you mean - the automatic use of # (or ## for sub heads) is good as it would allow you to restructure the book at any stage without then changing the page names (although you will need to do it first off).  In a sense it is your call as you are the major contributor to the book and I don't see it as highly important.  However longer term it may be easier to have pages that are not numbered so that they can be moved on the title page without looking strange.

:::If you want to do it there is no need to loose anything.  Just use the &quot;move&quot; button and create the new name for the page.  This would mean for example that [[Honda Nighthawk Owners Repair and Maintenance Guide/1 Guidelines for contributors]] would become [[Honda Nighthawk Owners Repair and Maintenance Guide/Guidelines for contributors]] say (if you do this move the link will no longer be red!).  The front page can then be changed to
:::# [[/Guidelines for contributors/]]
:::If you then want to change the order you can do so without changing the page names.  Hope this helps, you know where I am if you want me - regards --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:17, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

==Image copyright problem with [[:Image:Snootbootfix.jpg]]==

[[Image:Plitvice lakes.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Plitvice Lakes]]

This book aims to be a complete guide to the Croatian language. From the basics, to the most advanced concepts of grammar and speech. It also aims to provide some miscellaneous information in relation to Croatia and the Croatian language (for example: history of the Croatian language, different dialects, how the Croatian language evolved, etcetera).

==The Lessons and Reference/Lekcije i preporuke==
The lessons are put into levels. Each level focuses on a certain part of Croatian, to help build up your knowledge of the language, also known simply as Croatian. For example, the first level is mostly vocabulary. After studying and learning all the levels and lessons, hopefully the reader will be able to speak Croatian fluently. The levels are mainly for people who want to learn Croatian seriously as another language. If you wish to learn some of the language quickly because of business, a holiday or just out of curiosity, the reference is here for a quick guide. If you are familiar with another Slavic language (cf. Russian, Polish, Czech,Serbian,Bulgarian etc...), then you are at an advantage as Croatian shares the same noun declinations and sentence structures as her sister languages.

Reference is not a guide, however nor is it similar to the lessons. It is large portions of this South Slavic language put into a small area so the reader can look up verbs quickly without having to go through the lessons to find it. However, if you want to learn some more vocabulary, please use Level 1, not Reference to look up the word you want. Level 1 is not rigidly structured, so it is easy to use, like a dictionary.

==Under Construction/U izradi==
This book is currently under construction. The squares next to each page, level or lesson, shows whether the content inside is completed or not. Below shows what stages these squares show:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Croatian alphabet==
Croatian is an easy language to spell. Each letter is pronounced separately and clearly in almost every position and each word is spelt as it is pronounced (some exceptions are odsvirati pronounced [otsvirati]; another one is odšteta pronounced [otšteta]...). However, some words have a few vowels pronounced longer than others, so if you don't pronounce its vowels in correct length it might have a different meaning (for example: when &quot;kada&quot; is pronounced as it's written it means when, but when it's pronounced with a longer first a then it means bathtub).

The Croatian language uses a Latin alphabet, with 30 letters.

The following table lists all of the letters, together with pronunciations and &quot;as in...&quot; notes for easier pronunciation. 

Note: Because of their similarity in pronucation, some Croatian children in certain areas don't learn to differ Č and Ć, Đ and DŽ or &quot;je&quot; and &quot;ije&quot; before fifth grade. Stress almost always falls on the second-last or third-last syllable

To oversimplify, remember six rules:

1. For the &quot;c&quot; without a hat, remember &quot;cats.&quot; In English we pronounce the cat's head (&quot;c&quot;) but in Croatian the tail is pronounced (&quot;ts&quot;).

2. A hat on a &quot;c,&quot; &quot;s,&quot; or &quot;z&quot; becomes an English &quot;ch,&quot; &quot;sh,&quot; or &quot;zh.&quot; Pronounce &quot;ć&quot; like &quot;č&quot;, because it makes learning Croatian easier.

3. DŽ is an English &quot;j,&quot; as in &quot;John.&quot;

4. For &quot;h&quot; pretend you're Scottish and saying &quot;loch&quot; or German saying &quot;Bach.&quot;

5. The &quot;i&quot; and &quot;u&quot; vowels are always long, never short.

6. The &quot;j&quot; is pronounced like &quot;y&quot; in English.
==Stress==
Croatian language has 4 types of stress.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|
!rising
!falling
|-
!short
|`
|‶
|-
!long
|´
|⌒
|}
And there's also &quot;ˉ&quot;. It means that the vowel is pronounced longer, but the stress isn't on this vowel. Example is pìlōt.&lt;br&gt;
Every stress has it's name: short-rising (kratkouzlazni), short-falling (kratkosilazni), long-rising (dugouzlazni), long-falling (dugosilazni).&lt;br&gt;
Examples: žèna (wife; it means e is short, and the intonations is rising)&lt;br&gt;
kȕća (house; it means u is short, and the intonations is falling)&lt;br&gt;
rúka (arm; it means u is long, and the intonation is rising)&lt;br&gt;
zlâto (gold; it means a is long, and the intonation is falling)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The ampersand (&amp;)===
I'm starting to learn Ruby and I think there is a mistake in the section about the ampersand.
The redefinition of &lt;tt&gt;to_proc&lt;/tt&gt; in class Symbol defined as

 def to_proc
    lambda {|x, *args| x.send(self, *args)}
 end

doesn't work in my Ruby version 1.8.

What works is this:

 def to_proc
    lambda {|*args| self.send(self, *args)}
 end

I am not sure if the first version worked in any of the previous releases of Ruby?

I would like to change it, but I would really appreciate someone checking if the new code is really 100% correct.

--[[User:Filu|filu]] 17:51, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

OK, the mistake is mine. The version of &lt;tt&gt;to_proc&lt;/tt&gt; method found in the article indeed works, for
method calls such as is the case with the &lt;tt&gt;upcase&lt;/tt&gt;. However my version works for function calls, such as

 def fun_upcase( s )
    s.upcase
 end
which in turn cannot be combined with the original &lt;tt&gt;to_proc&lt;/tt&gt;.

Maybe this should be clarified in the text of the article.

--[[User:Filu|filu]] 19:31, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

== Great Explanation ==

Wow what a wonderful explanation of Proc and Blocks. I was struggling with these when doing Rails project. Now everything seems to make sense and is clear.

This is an attempt to make it possible to give attributions, claim authorship and grant any rights under the license used on Wikibooks. The use of this template has legal implications. If you are interested in the subject read carefully the Wikibooks copyright statement existing in each page the draft of [[Wikibooks talk:Ownership]] and it's talk page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:58, 29 October 2008 (UTC)

==Removing the comment about Source code==
How is the bit about source code important to say [[Biblical Studies/Authors]]? Also, why is this acceptable? How do we know permission has been obtained from the other people that contribute to the books that use this template? Who are we to relicense their contributions into the public domain? My opinion is that we cannot course we cannot only the copyright holder's themselves can do that.  Only the people themselves do that, and as this requirement is not part of our terms of use, then individual books cannot do this.  ''Especially'' after the book has had source code contributed to it before any such claims about the public domain where in place as with [[C++ Programming]]. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 00:13, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

:If the book has no source code, &quot;Any source code included...&quot; it becomes void. It is a template it could probably be reworked to make it facultative, in any case only the right owners my decide if it is acceptable or not, in the specific case of [[Biblical Studies]] no one has claimed rights over that work, my use of the template was to give attributions to Wikipedia... (For historical context the template was exclusive to the C++ Programming namespace it was later moved to the global namespace)
:Permissions are given by anyone that states rights over the work. Regarding the issue of source code in general the issue is more extensive and a solution like we use for images would be needed (having each source code that is copyrightable and constitutes or permits stand alone use to be licensed on its own) for instance before the recent license change to be legal if a user took the code and used it on his computer he would have to include a copy of the GFDL (for use and redistribution).
:If you aren't claiming ownership over a source code or a work the Authors page is irrelevant to you.  If a copyright holder has a claim he can always use the established practice to correct issues or request a pulldown of the work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:33, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

:PS: Notice that some source code on the [[C++ Programming]] has included an author or mentions other licenses IIRC GPL. If have issues with the use of the template on the [[Biblical Studies]] feel free to substitute it by a similar text that provides the necessary acknowledgment to Wikipedia.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:39, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

I think the public domain notice violates copyright law since it is not part of any terms of use for Wikibooks and people cannot be expected to be aware of the notice nor to have agreed to those terms. I think the only safe option is to assume that source code is released under both the GFDL and CC-BY-SA when there is no message included with the source code to the contrary and a user that submitted the code does not have a message on the user page stating otherwise. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:40, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

:I agree that it can be a problem, but only to copyright claims and those can be easily addressed. If you remember Robert did put forward that the submit phrase should mention that situation. There is also the issue of dual license before the licensed change we had a work that was dual licensed (IIRC Swift was the proponent) and there are other cases, some I have pointed out before some are even more ambiguous like [[More C++ Idioms/Detached Counted Body]] (notice the last lines), In that particular case I really don't have a formed opinion I can't even state over what Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs Innovations. is claiming ownership (the source code or the concept), I do however see a conflict in regards to use as Wikibooks licenses don't prevent commercial use of the content, but I decided not to make waves as if there is a problem the rights owners should be the ones making them evident (this is also my approach to general copyvio issues, even if I understand some benefits in being proactive in some instances).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:51, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

:: Its a problem not only for copyright claims, but also for anyone wishing to reuse it because they might incorrectly assume that there are no limits or restriction on the use of the source code when there may in fact be limits or restrictions. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:40, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

::: In general terms that is not the case since public domain is less restrictive than our licenses, hence the benefit in adding the line about source code to the authors page. It makes clear that if a piece of code doesn't clear indicate a license it is PD, not even the persons listed as authors are claiming owning them. If any code is added that is not PD or does not conform in license with the CC-BY-SA 3.0 License or the GFDL, then the submit phrasing makes it an issue, for instance a GPL source would not be usable if we intended to be strict about the interpretation and value of it. In fact source code that does not conform to our licenses would be more similar to fair use images, in any case a huge change on the system would be required to really address in full the issue of source code. Until we have a problem requiring a pull down of this type of content we should only attempt to make sure any licenses or copyrights are clearly stated.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:25, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

:::: I think you miss darklama's point.  The point is that the reuser has legal liability they did not know they had.  Hypothetically suppose some user Cppmaster appears and adds many good examples of code in writing the book.  Later I come along and think &quot;Hey those are awesome, I want to put them in my C++ book.  Since they are public domain I don't even need to provide a link to wikibooks (because WB has a much better book. If people know it exists why buy my book?).  Then Cppmaster sues me.  He says he never agreed for his code to be PD, he never saw this notice, it doesn't apply to him.  Well it would be a legal mess to sort out.  If I had known at the start it was only creative commons at the beginning, I would have included the link to WB and sold a few less books instead of paying for a lawyer and possibly paying royalties to Cppmaster.  I suggest you go the other way.  Place a userbox on your user page that says &quot;Any samples of code posted this user on wikibooks are released into the public domain.&quot;  As it stands this public domain statement should come out of the template.

::::::These seem to be site wide user licenses, going beyond a specific book. They are useful, to avoid confusion, but ownership/authorship has to be directly claimed (mostly like signing one's work), can't be attributed by a third party.
::::::An example of the submit clause limitations is when using content that is not created by the contributor and the attribution of rights only by relying only on the edit history. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:01, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

:::::In case of that type of problem, the final user of a miss licensed work can be ordered by a court to stop distribution, and can claim compensation for losses to the culprit (among other variations), in a wiki (and in Wikimedia project) that liability is limited but indeed it is a problem for those that decide to claim authorship (it goes with the responsibility bit). In any case Wikimedia will never be in danger per the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Authors&amp;action=submit Terms of Use]. This limited liability is valid even contributors that don't claim authorship, they are open to be targeted by a copyright infringement process, but since this is a non-profit venture, I doubt that anything very grave would come of that, but if the work is used commercially then it becomes extremely problematic.
:::::The information on the authors page is as valuable as the submit clause (even if I agree that it is not as visible), anyone contributing to a book is doing just that, it is responsible for understanding what and for what he is contributing, books are expected to be self contained works (this is different from Wikipedia). In any case the problem with source code is not a specific problem with one book, it is a problem with all books that use source code (as I said similar to the use of images). I can't remember what was said by I recall that this issue was already discussed with [[User:Robert Horning]] (a Wikibookian that claimed and to my understanding demonstrated good knowledge of US copyright law) and an understanding on Wikimedia rulings on those aspect and the history of the project.

:::::: Ok, how about the following for compromises.  
::::::# Either we make a template similar in spirit to the ones above but allows for us to specify which books it applies to.

::::::::To compromise it would require you had made a specific point I could agree or refuse to object too or something we can meet in the middle, literally something that each side makes concessions over, examining your proposal it is clear you aren't making any concessions.
::::::::So far no specific point has been made, yes we have lots of unknowables but they seem to be the same and so have equal value. In fact I have shown you that there are and have been far more complex issues in similar situations or with similar impact, that the issue regarding source code is a system/project wide issue that this template is attempting to address. Notice that the template also provides a statement about image licenses, most books do not.
::::::::Since you are not claiming that you have added code to the works that isn't PD or hasn't a compatible license information, you don't have any motive to object to the template use. Any code that fails those characteristics will be removed as not compatible with the licenses of Wikibooks (as is normal to all incompatible content). The prevarication issue Darklama raised can happen with or without the template, in fact in most uses of the template I'm taking part of the responsibility if that happens.
::::::::Note also that templates above are for userspace not particularly suitable to be added to books. In any case I don't have any issue in you adding another template to [[Biblical Studies]] as I said I only added this one because the work needed attributions. Did I miss something in the shuffle ? How do you still see the present state as problematic ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:06, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

{{outdent|::::::::}} Yes I still find the current situation problematic.  The statement I took out was put back in verbatim, so it is difficult to feel like anything I am concerned with has been address.  As I said in the beginning: 
#By adding this statement other peoples code has been relicenced without their agreement or permission.  If I was caught unaware about this, it seems safe to assume other users will be (or have been) as well.
#I feel should not place a copyright notice a book that requires stricter requirements (in terms of giving up rights) than our Terms of Use.  Particularly since we cannot agree people contributing to the book have seen or accepted these terms.
#I believe Darklama is correct this statement could also prove to be problematic for reusers.

I admit that the first possibility of making a more specific disclaimer on your user page was more of an alternative then a compromise.  However, if the WMF said it was acceptable to use this claimer there would still be the question ''should'' we use the disclaimer.  As a contributor to one of the books where this disclaimer is displayed my answer would be normally be no.
The compromise was meant to be that, yes I will agree to it if the WMF says it is ok.

I have thought of a third possibility, which may or may not be seen as a compromise.  Instead of marking source code that isn't public domain we instead mark that code that ''is'' public domain.  This way if someone is unaware of the notice, no problem they will not mark their source code as public domain.  We could even creative and make a public domain template that puts a box around the source tags in a box and at the bottom of the box buts in very small type &quot;public domain&quot;.  A person using such a template would realize they were including their work on the public domain.

:#The disclaimer is ambiguous enough not to cause any issues (&quot;Any source code included if not bearing a different statement shall be considered under the public domain.&quot;) you can interpret it in several way including, a way that the Wikibooks license is in effect. That view will resolve your dilemma. 
:#There are no stricter requirements anywhere. What do you see as stricter requirements ?
:#Reuse is problematic with or without the disclaimer, can you guarantee that all source conforms with the project's licenses ? You can't, and I can affirm that they don't, that is why we have the copyvio process for those issues. What changes here ?

::# The disclaimer is an issue whether it i ambiguous or not. Users probably won't get that &quot;a different statement&quot; means or could imply the statement seen when submitting works, the Media policy, the Copyright page, or the Terms of Use page. If the Wikibooks license is in effect than the disclaimer is equivalent to an empty statement which isn't helpful.
::# Just because nobody can guarantee that all source code conforms with the project's license doesn't mean that we shouldn't try. Nothing changes, by default contributions are assumed to be available under Wikibooks' license, unless there is reasonable evidence to the contrary, like another website has the same material.

:::I think we are going around in circles and I'm not making myself understood.
:::#The statement is required because source code has the same issues that we have with images (if you don't understand that then there is no point in continue this discussion as you will never understand what I'm speaking of). That is not a problem with my template, but is a system issue, you can find source code for instance in the Ada book that has its specific license and copyright owner. In any case we (you and me) have already discussed this issue many times...
:::#That is why the disclaimer is used, to remove any doubts that the code can be used in stand alone form without complicated licenses like the GFDL or a specific reference to the CC-BY-SA 3.0 (even more since there may be no-one to attribute the code, a copyright owner).
:::#I don't fully fallow you here. The disclaimer is not a license (see the difference if you don't understand the concept), it is just a clarification. AS I pointed out before the GPL (and others) are not compatible with the GFDL and (I think) the CC-BY_SA 3.0, if you really intend to treat them as normal content, you have already much cleanup work pending before getting into the hypothetical. Of course I will object to such treatment since I defend that source code has a specific need for licensing (much like the images, as stated before), my solution solves the issue to deal with that in system, since unlike images source code is text and in many instances already includes the necessary copyright declaration.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:05, 5 December 2010 (UTC) 
::::: We need to change the discussion here.  It is too focused on who is correct or incorrect.  Let's put aside the explicit discussions of GFDL, GPL, CC-BY_SA 3.0.  The point is that Darklama and I disagree with the inclusion of this disclaimer into the book.  You can't just unilaterally decide it goes back in. Leaving the statement in as is simply isn't an option.  We need to find some constructive way to make sure we are all happy with the end result, so we need some ideas.  To modify an idea I had above, if snippets of code should be treated like images, let's treat them more like images with the means we have available to us.  We could create a template that places small link at the bottom of the box for the code.  The link go be followed to the appropriate licensing information for that snippet of code, what ever that may be (a copy of GPL, a list of authors and the license, etc.).  If this is unacceptable what would you suggest? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 01:19, 6 December 2010 (UTC)
:::::: I have just shown you that this was the best solution I came about without making a system wide change that would require every source code that is present on our works to require that licensing information or be deleted (that will be extremely damaging to our project).
:::::: If you still don't understand what is at issue, read the Wikibooks:Media and substitute images by source code, remove the fair use concept (that can be valid to snippets by most uses are to small to get copyright coverage, in any case for instance on the Windows books, using the examples of the Win32 API would fall under fair use), you will notice that even then incompatible licensed code will constitute a problem so a special type of limited use would be required.
:::::: These are legal matters if you intend to change this solution you are the one that has to come up with a viable alternative.
:::::: I'm an author on at least 2 works that use will use source code, I need to be clear to users that I'm not claiming any right over &quot;some&quot; of the code (I may add parts of code that I will require attribution or license under the GPL/BSD etc), ad that the included code, if not stating otherwise, is free to reuse (doesn't get the automatic copyright protection).
:::::: I respect your concerns and think I have addressed them sufficient to show you that there is no cause for them, that in fact there are more grave issues behind this. We already have established forms to deal with any violation of the copyright.
:::::: In any case this was how I as author/copyright owner decided to establish my rights and how I require those works to be attributed as per our policies. I will be thinking in ways of improving it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 10:26, 6 December 2010 (UTC)  
::::::: Let me be clear that no action has been taken to address my nor darklama's concerns.  I understand you felt this was the best solution make your intentions clear to users, but it doesn't make make things clear at all, it mistakenly gives the impression that any code which does not explicitly have disclaimer to the contrary next to it is in the public domain.  I am also a author and copyright holder over part of at least [[C++ Programming]], and I feel this solution is inappropriate.  I can't blame you for being bold and adding the disclaimer, but it is a bit frustrating you repeatedly tell us this is fine when we tell you this is a problem.  I am going to attempt to put something a bit in between taking it out completely and leaving it as is.  Let me know what you think.

:::::::: I made a small addition and I can live with it. But noticed that any source code that doesn't now have a license information is in limbo (regarding use and distribution outside of the book's context). That is not a problem specific to the project but an issue created by the copyright law that abolished the need to state a copyright statement on works making any work presumable to be copyrighted, my solution attempted to make that bit clearer and was less verbose.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 11:34, 6 December 2010 (UTC)
::::::::: Much better, but I still have a small issue with the last sentence, as I intended to add myself to the authors list of [[C++ Programming]] (pending the resolution of our disagreement or lack thereof depending on who you ask) and the last sentence would no longer be true for the both of us.

::::::::::: I don't particularly agree with the last change as the template is to be generic if other authors have other requirements they should simply create their version of the template. I'm even considering making a copy of the template to my userspace and restructuring it so to reflect it my own specific attribution requirements in place of attempting to provide a general framework to other Wikibookians. Something on the lines of what you proposed earlier. The previous text was clear enough for my understanding if people needed to state a right they would include it to the source there was no need to state it specifically here (it now also makes it seem that any one that doesn't list his name on the authors page will not be able to claim rights over the source code).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:01, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

:All this considerations are important an is beneficial to the project that more Wikibookians become aware of the subject (and the distinctions), for example I also see people claiming authorship based on the creation of works, in that specific cases under the copyright law creation doesn't mean the same as initiating a book project. In any case this subject as we already talked is important and should be under community discussion and decision and some deeper topic would even require Wikimedia to take a clear position.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:01, 5 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

Ice has become more important recently in drinks.  Different shapes and styles are de facto in the cutting edge mixologist's repertoire.

Styles:
::Twice Frozen (or many times frozen) achieves a similar goal to heating before freezing.  The air that is in solution with the water comes out of solution and allows the ice to freeze into a more dense, harder to melt block.  This is useful for martinis and other drinks that are best served cold, but should not be watered down.
::Mineral/Bottled Water can impart a different flavor in the water.  This is usually used in citrus/acidic drinks where the melted water can mellow the drink out.

Shapes:
::A big block of ice allows pieces to be chipped off in the appropriate shapes and sizes.  Spears can be cut to fit into the shaker for stirring a martini, or small globes can be cut to fit into a tumbler.
::Larger-than-usual cubes are useful to keep a rocks drink cold but not melt too much, this can help a scotch/rocks keep its flavor while imparting a minimal amount of water into the drink.</text>

I am all mixed up. I went to a place I thought Operating System Design was going to start and posted a warning that I was going to mess around in major way. I still intend to. But what is wrong with the links? [[User:DKleinecke|DKleinecke]] 20:36, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

== Book Subject ==

Currently, this book provides Wikipedialike descriptions of the components which make an OS. All good and well, but I'd like to see some more system specific (say x86 (IA32) and/or AMD64, may be other systems) information about the design of the components. Specifics about boot loading for BIOS and for EFI, segmented memory model which is x86 specific, that kind of things.
Could the book be about designing (and writing?) an OS for common architecures, or should it be just a collection of wikipedic articles, as general as possible? [[User:Virtlink|Virtlink]] ([[User talk:Virtlink|talk]]) 15:11, 25 October 2008 (UTC)

== Operating System ==

Currently [[Operating System]] redirects to this page, [[Operating System Design]].
I suspect most people who come to Wikibooks and type &quot;Operating System&quot; are really looking for something more like [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]].
Should I change the redirect to go to that book?
Or would some sort of &quot;disambiguation page&quot; be better?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:44, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

== merge ==

I suggest merging [[Operating Systems Development]] into [[Operating System Design]].
I hope that one book can be useful to both the target audience of &quot;people who want to build a custom OS as a hobby and want a few hands-on, practical HOWTO tips&quot; as well as the target audience of &quot;people curious about how the OS they are using works, who might perhaps write application software that uses features such as multi-tasking processes and threads, but would never dream of actually changing the OS itself, and don't want to know obscure details about &quot;kernel-level debugging&quot; and other things that their machine will never do&quot;.

Feel free to try to persuade me that these audiences are so different that they need two separate books.

I think the two are related topics, but each might still merit its own book if authors can be found. I would think of operating system ''design'' as a more theoretical approach to the topic, probably with historical examples from various operating systems, but also heavy on the mathematics of the algorithms involved, while operating system ''development'' would assume that the person knew how to design an operating system and showed various and specific examples of how to do it given specific hardware.--[[User:Chuckhoffmann|Chuck Hoffmann]] ([[User talk:Chuckhoffmann|talk]]) 04:25, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

: {{done}}. The two books have merged. Perhaps someday in the future this book will grow so large that we split it into two books, either along the lines Chuck Hoffmann mentioned or along some other lines. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 23:02, 9 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

[[image:s_carbs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|1985 CB700/CB750SC Nighthawk S Carburetor]]

Rough idling, hard starting or other performance problems may be due to dirty carburetors. If the bike has sat for a few years or the gas tank shows signs of varnish and gum deposits the carb should be suspect. 

When servicing carbs be aware that:

1) Parts are fragile and become more so with age.

2) Parts made from rubber or plastic can be damaged by carb cleaners.

3) Gasoline is highly flammable. 
 
1984-1986 SB700&amp;750 

Recommend removing gas tank to do this job.
 
Ref 4-3 Rubber connecting tube between the air box and carb intake will be stiff due to age. Loosen both 10mm AF bolts at top rear of airbox and lever box backwards along the slots for 15mm until the bolts are fully back then tighten them there to give clearance for boot removal. Unclamp clips then push the rubber flange inward at the air box end. The connecting tube can now slide off the carb intake and out. WD40 applied to the joint may help.

Ref 4-3 The “Intake” pipe snootboot going to the cylinder head is extremely difficult to remove from the carb as the rubber is stiff.
Working the carb assembly up and down side to side may get results. Heating the rubber with a hair drier helps but rquires '''extreme caution''', make sure no sources of fuel are present.  Attempts to lever the carb off should be done with care to avoid damage to the linkage. [[image:Snootbootfix.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Using a Dremel tool to resize boot]] Removing the eight allen hd cap screws holding the intake flange to the head can be done if all else fails. To attempt this you will need a 1/4&quot; hex socket, a universal, with a selection of extensions. A ball end hex is also useful. Once off, resize the boot opening so next time you don't have to tear half the bike apart. A Dremel tool with a small drum works well.

Ref 4-4 Check each vacuum piston for movement (black cylinder) visible from the intake side of the carb. Place a finger below the piston and gently lift. Make note of any pistons that appear seized. 

Ref 4-4 The vacuum chamber cover screws may be difficult to remove. Avoid stripping the heads by using a proper fitting impact driver.

Carefully lift the cover while separating the rubber diaphragm. Remove spring and lift out piston with attached diaphragm.
The piston itself is probably not seized; chances are that the jet needle is stuck. Free it by spraying a small amount of carb cleaner around the end of the jet needle visible through the intake end of the carb. Allow to soak and gently work the needle buy rotating the piston from above. Remove the piston when free. Remember carb cleaner kills rubber; keep it well away from the diaphragm.

Ref 4-5 As you lift the bowl the gasket should stay in the groove on the bowl side. Carefully separate the gasket as the bowl is lifted.

Ref 4-5 to 4-6 Check to make sure the needle valves move freely before attempting to disassemble. Frozen needle valves can be lifted by a collar at the top of the valve where the plastic float is attached . Avoid applying force directly to the plastic float. Avoid using carb cleaner to loosen the valve as the pointed end is made from rubber. 

Use a proper fitting screwdriver or where possible a socket to remove the jets. 

Ref 4-7 Choke (bystarter) valve removal. Remember orientation of  the spring on the choke shaft (bot of 4-7)

Ref 4-8 after loosening the choke shaft locking screws, check the shaft to make sure it slides with finger pressure. If still frozen, slightly  wedge open each of the 4 arm clamps and apply some WD40. The dark colored nut on top of each choke valve is made from plastic and will shear off under excessive force.  Do not attempt to remove the choke shaft by hammering the end. 

Ref 4-13 Pilot screw must be removed for cleaning the low speed circuit. Do not over tighten when counting the turns in. The factory setting is two turns out.

Ref 4-10 Carb Cleaning –“Clean all carburetor passages with compressed air”  who ever wrote this manual must have been dreaming.

1) Scrape varnish off as much of the float bowl as possible. Spray with carb cleaner and let soak.

2) Fill a dish with carb cleaner and drop in the brass jets and choke plungers.
 
3) Visually trace all of the fuel and air passages in the carb body.

The fuel passages are:  a) High Speed (main jet)   b) Low Speed (slow)   c) Choke 

Jet towers, float valve opening/seat and choke valve opening should be thoroughly cleaned by soaking in carb cleaner. Working the cleaner with a Qtip and a small bristle brush works well.
Next spray carb cleaner into each of the fuel passages. Let sit for 10 minutes and use compressed air to blow each passage out out. If you haven’t figured out the circuit, you may get a face full of carb cleaner at this point. Repeat procedure until the carb cleaner is clear when blown into a white pape towel.

4) The needle valve requires special attention to the small spring loaded rod at the top of the valve. Gently push on the rod and see if it moves into the valve body. If it does not move freely, set the pin end of the valve in a shallow tray of carb cleaner with the rubber end up and out of the cleaner. Soak until the pin is free. 

5) Small fuel tubes inter-connecting the carbs contain plastic and rubber components. Any carb cleaner leaking into these should be blown out promptly.

6) Carb cleaners may attack the plastic floats. Exercise caution. &lt;is there any way to adjust float levels by bending the plastic?&gt;

7) After a thorough cleaning, hold the jets up to the light for inspection. 

8) Blow out all air passages.

== Sources ==

Some suggestions:
1. There is no U.S. 'Civil Law'.  I suggest deleting 'Civil Law'.
2. Links should be made to online sources whenever possible.

The below are some suggested links.
www.uscourts.gov
www.justia.gov (started by the guy that did Findlaw)
www.wikipedia.org 
www.findlaw.com
www.supremecourtus.gov

Also, I think that a compilation of sources for all law books should be a separately maintained page.  This way, one could look at a list of links... and see if there is a public source available.  Findlaw is good for this, but perhaps a decent wikipage would do too?

&gt;Actually, there is a US Civil Law.  See for e.g.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_law

As of December 1, 2007, the Fed.R.Civ.P. were completely restyled according to the plain english movement and promulgated by the Court. I don't see any reason why they could not be reproduced for reference's sake here. [[Special:Contributions/68.56.90.231|68.56.90.231]] ([[User talk:68.56.90.231|talk]]) 23:12, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

Added 5/22/09:  I agree that the term US Civil Law is misleading, implying as it does that there is a general civil law in the US.  It's also true, as noted, that Louisiana follows certain (but not all) civil law principles, but they are considered by most attorneys to be an exception to the general practice of US law.

Civil law should, IMO, not be merged with civil procedure.  The term civil is used in a very different way.  Civil procedure is the process by which courts carry out their business, and as noted the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have been adopted by almost all states.  Civil law is, in the US, pretty much unique to Louisiana.  It would be unnecessarily confusing to combine them.</text>

'''This Section:'''
__TOC__



==Introduction==
Protein-protein interactions are extremely dependent upon the three-dimensional structure of involved proteins, more-so than just their amino acid sequences.  The way a polypeptide chain folds into its operational condition ''in vivo'' has long been determined by experimental techniques like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography X-ray crystallography] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMR NMR].  Both of these methods are long, laborious processes that often deliver questionable results, and at best are only elevant to the protein being studied or proteins that are known to be closely related.  Recent advances in science and computing have enabled 3D structures of proteins to be accurately predicted for a subset of small, simple proteins using nothing more than their amino acid sequence.  As an offshoot of this, protein-protein alignments can be done according to structural features as well as amino acid sequence, suggesting the function of uncharacterized proteins with no known relatives and thus providing insight into the way they will interact with other proteins in a system.&lt;ref&gt;Tolchin, E.  [http://www.genpromag.com/ShowPR.aspx?PUBCODE=018&amp;ACCT=1800000100&amp;ISSUE=0507&amp;RELTYPE=PR&amp;ORIGRELTYPE=PRO&amp;PRODCODE=00000000&amp;PRODLETT=T&amp;CommonCount=0  In Silico Techniques Tell How the Protein Turns] Reed Life Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction Methods Using Protein Space==
Many prediction methods used to predict three-dimensional protein structure are the same as those used to predict how proteins of known structures will interact[[Proteomics/Protein - Protein Interactions/Prediction| (click here)]].  The &quot;correct&quot; way of prediction is to try and score all possibile conformations, which is computationally intensive.  The only known work-around is to develop short-cut methods that sacrafice 100% accuracy to gain speed.  Emerging trends in computational structure prediction combine algorithms with biological knowledge to take a &quot;smart search&quot; approach, only focusing on areas of proteins that are most likely to be biologically significant.  This is an admitted improvement over the &quot;random search until a near-optimal configuration is found&quot; approach.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, O.,  Brunette, T.J. Predicting Protein Structure with Guided Conformation Space Search. 2005. http://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~oli/publications/src/tr05-63.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protein Structure Alignment Using Structural Space==
[[Image:Structure_space_map.jpg|frame|An example of a structure space map.]]
Another direction that is being taken is to adapt primary sequence alignment methods to consider secondary and tertiary structure.     There are a number of features of proteins integral to their function and interaction with other proteins that are not determined by amino acid sequence alone.  Many proteins share functional properties despite vast sequence differences because of the shapes that they fold into.  One method of simultaneously quantifying and visualizing these relationships is using a protein structure space map.[[Proteomics/Protein - Protein Interactions/Protein Space/References| [¹]]]  Roughly speaking, a Protein structure space map is the result of scoring how well known proteins match, structurally.  That score is used as a directional distance used to position families of proteins in relation to each other on a set of axes, closer if they are more similar, distantly if they are more dissimilar.  Anyone can look at the structure space map and immediately judge how similar two proteins or protein families are by their proximity on the map.

There are a number of structural alignment tools and databases available commercially and freely on the web.  A good list of them can be found on the Wikipedia page for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_alignment_software#Structural_alignment alignment software].

==Factors Affecting Protein Protein Interactions[http://www.biology.ucsd.edu/classes/bggn220.FA06/ProtProtinteractions.pdf]==
&lt;!--poulami--&gt;

The analysis of protein protein interactions can be of two kinds :
# Qualitative
# Quantitative

In both the cases we have factors related to the interactions
Factors affecting the qualitative analysis are discussed before. In this section we would mainly try to concentrate on the quantitative analysis.

==Factors Affecting the Quantitative protein protein interactions==

With regards to binding factors we mean whether the interaction is one-to-one or one-to-many binding. The one-to-one binding interactions can be quantified very easily but the problems lies when one protein has more than one binding sites. For one-to-many binding sites, there can be again two possibilities. If all these many binding are not associated with each other or in other words independent of each other we can just treat each binding as one-to-one and then sum them up all together. But if all these interactions are dependent on each other then we have to deal with its allosteric affects.

So the factors affecting the binding properties are :

#[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor-ligand_kinetics Kinetics]
#[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_properties Thermodynamics Properties]

===Affinity===

#Ka (affinity constant) or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_constant Kd(dissociation Constant)]
#Kd=1/Ka

===Kinetics===

#k(ass) or k(on) association rate constant or on rate
#K(diss) or K(off) dissociation rate constant or off rate

===Thermodynamics properties===
#[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_change Enthalpy Change]
#[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy Entropy Change]
#[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity Heat Capacity change]
#[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_free_energy_change Gibbs free energy change]
#Role of Water

====Role of Water====
Since most of the protein protein interactions take place in acqueous phase we should also consider the affect of water in an interaction. Water makes the environment quite hydrophobic and considerably favourable for protein interactions as they are also hydrophobic molecules.Due to the abundance of water molecules, most of the bonds need to be broken to make the protein interactions favorable.Water can also act as a cementing material in the hydrophobic gaps between two proteins.

Generally accepted principles for [[w:Graphical user interface|Graphical user interface]] design are: 

1.	'''Aesthetically pleasing'''
Provide visual appeal by following these presentation and graphic design principles:
* Provide meaningful contrast between screen elements.
* Create groupings.
* Align screen elements and groups.
* Provide three dimensional representation
* Use colors and graphics effectively and simply.

2.	'''Clarity''' 
The interface should be visually, conceptually and linguistically clear, including
* Visual elements
* Functions
* Metaphors
* Words and text

3.	'''Compatibility''' 
Provide compatibility with the following:
* The user
* The task and job
* The product
* Adopt the user’s perspective

4.	'''Comprehensibility'''
A system should be easily understood and learned. A user should know the following
* What to do
* What to look at
* When to do it
* Where to do it
* Why to do it
* How to do it
* The flow of actions, responses, visual preparations and information should be in a sensible order that is easy to recollect and place in context.

5.	'''Configurability''' 
Permit easy personalization, configuration and reconfiguration of settings.
* Enhances a sense of control
* Encourages an active role in understanding

6.	'''Consistency''' 
A system should look, act, and operate the same throughput. Similar components should:
* Have a similar look
* Have similar uses.
* Operate similarly
* The same action should always yield the same result.
* The function of the elements should not change
* The position of standard elements should not change.

7.	'''Control'''
The user must control the interaction.
* Actions should result from explicit user requests
* Actions should be performed quickly
* Actions should be capable of interruption or termination
* The user should never be interrupted for errors
* The context maintained must be from the perspective of the user.
* The means to achieve goals should be flexible and compatible with the user’s skills, experiences, habits and preferences.
* Avoid modes since they constrain the actions available to the user.
* Permit the user to customize aspects of the interface, while always 	providing a proper set of defaults.

8.	'''Directness'''
Provide direct ways to accomplish tasks
* Available alternatives should be visible,
* The effect of actions on objects should be visible.

9.	'''Efficiency'''
* Minimize eye and hand movements, and other control actions.
* Transitions between various system controls should flow easily and 		freely.
* Navigation paths should be as short as possible.
* Eye movement through a screen should be obvious and sequential.
* Anticipate the user’s wants and needs whenever possible.

10.	'''Familiarity'''
Employ familiar concepts and use a language that is familiar to the user.
* Keep the interface natural, mimicking the user’s behavior patterns.
* Use real world metaphors.

11.	'''Flexibility'''
A system must be flexible to the different needs of its users, enabling a level and type of performance based upon:
* Each user’s knowledge and skills.
* Each user’s experience.
* Each user’s personal preference
* Each user’s habits
* The conditions at that moment

12.	'''Forgiveness'''
* Tolerate and forgive common and unavoidable human errors
* Prevent errors from occurring whenever possible.
* Protect against possible catastrophic errors.
* When an error does occur, provide constructive messages.

13.	'''Predictability'''
The user’s should be able to anticipate the natural progression of the task.
* Provide distinct and recognizable screen elements
* Provide cues to the result of an action to be performed
* All expectations should be fulfilled uniformly and completely.

14.	'''Recovery'''
A system should permit:
* Commands or actions to be abolished or reversed.
* Immediate return to a certain point if difficulties arise.
Ensure that users never lose their work as a result of
* An error on their part
* H/W, S/W or communication problems.

15.	'''Responsiveness''' The system must rapidly respond to the user’s requests.
* Provide immediate acknowledgement for all user actions
* Visual
* Textual
* Auditory

16.	'''Simplicity'''
* Provide as simple an interface as possible
* Provide defaults
* Minimize screen alignment points.
* Make common actions simple at the expense of uncommon actions being made harder.
* Provide uniformity and consistency
Five ways to provide simplicity:
* Present common and necessary functions first.
* Prominently feature important functions,
* Hide more sophisticated and less frequently used functions

17.	'''Transparency'''
* Permit the user to focus on the task or job, without concern for the mechanics of the interface.
* Workings and reminders of workings inside the computer should be invisible to the user.

18.	'''Trade-offs'''
* Final design will be based on a series of trade-offs balancing often-conflicting design principles
* People’s requirements always take precedence over technical requirements

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Data types on the TI 83+/84+=
There are only 5 data types for the TI 83+/84+, one of them being an emulated one (not supported by hardware, calculated in software).

The data types are:

* uByte 8-bit value in the range of 0 through 255
* sByte 8-bit signed value in the range of -128 through 127
* Word  16-bit value in the range of 0 through 65535
* sWord 16-bit signed value in the range of -32768 through 32767
* TI float, 9 bytes, 1 sign byte, 1 signed exponent, 7 BCD bytes of the mantissa.
sword is a signed word, not a piece of metal, TI floats are not supported by hardware.

Assemblers often use db for a byte (signed or unsigned) and dw for a word (signed or unsigned).

Although TI floats are not supported by hardware, there are a lot of ROM calls for them, most of which can be found in '83psysroutines.pdf' which can be downloaded from TI's site.

For math with other data types it is best to take a look at [http://baze.au.com/misc/z80bits.html z80bits]

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Natural Selection===

More offspring are produced than finite resources can support. Individuals thus can be viewed as in a constant struggle for existence. Individuals within a population are rarely clones, they commonly show variation in phenotypes as well as genotypes. Some of this variation in behavioral phenotypes is heritable. As successful variants are more likely to survive and reproduce, their genotypes will be become overrepresented in the next generation

Density-independent and density-dependent growth models: '''Exponential Model''': a species can potentially increase in numbers according to a geometric series -- Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834) Logistic Model: the rate of population increase may be limited, i.e. it may depend on population density -- Pierre Verhulst (1838). '''Carrying Capacity''' (K): an environment's maximum persistently supportable load (Catton 1986).

'''Natural selection''' is the process by which environmental effects lead to varying degrees of reproductive success among individuals of a population of organisms with different hereditary characters, or traits. The characters that inhibit reproductive success decrease in frequency from generation to generation. It is the process whereby certain genes (alleles) gain greater representation in the following generations compared to other alleles. '''Adaptations''' are the complement of traits that increases the fitness of the owner. An individual's '''Fitness''' or Reproductive Success is the relative probability that an animal of a particular genotype and phenotype will manage to contribute its genes to the next generation

Aside from Natural Selection, changes in gene frequencies within a population may also arise from a variety of other sources including:

*Mutations: changes to individual nucleotide bases along the DNA to large scale rearrangements of chromosomes
*Gene flow: Emigration, Immigration
*Genetic drift: Changes in the genetics of the population as a result of chance. Bottlenecks and Founder Effect: Ellis-van Creveld Syndrome is an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia that results in short limbed disproportionate dwarfism. The syndrome most commonly occurs in the Amish population of Lancaster, Pa. The incidence is approximately 5 per 1000 live births and 2 per 1000 living persons. No case had been described in the Amish of Ohio, Indiana, or other Amish areas at the time of an extensive search performed by McKusick, et al. The genealogy of the disorder in the Amish of Lancaster, Pa. can be traced back to the immigrants Samuel King and his wife
Example: H.B.D. Kettlewell's work on Industrial Melanism

==Population Genetics and Behavior==
Population genetics described the statistical distribution of genes in a particular breeding population, such as a breed of dog, and examines the role of various biological effects on gene distribution. While ordinary genetics predicts phenotypic makups of the next generation, population genetics concerns itself with genetics predictions for a breeding group several generations into the future.

===Population===
A '''population''' is the collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographic area. When all individuals in a population are identical with regard to a particular phenotypic trait they are known as monomorphic. When the individuals show several variants of a particular trait they are polymorphic. The '''Gene pool''' for a species or population is the complete set of unique alleles present in it. While large gene pools indicate robust populations, extensive genetic diversity, and a good chance to survive bouts of intense selection, low genetic diversity is associated with reduced biological fitness and an increased chance of extinction.

===Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium===
The '''Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium''' posits that allele frequencies will remain constant across generations if the population is large and individuals are mating randomly. Moreover, we will be able to accurately predict genotype frequencies from gene frequencies (e.g., in a two-allele system - a2+2aA+A2). It produces a null model against which genotype frequencies of a real population are compared. Even when a disequilibrium exists, a HW equilibrium will reestablish after one generation of random mating. What are the assumptions? What will produce deviations from the HW equilibrium? What might produce an excess of heterozygotes (e.g. HLA-1, MHC)? What might produce an excess of homozygotes? Deviations from HW equilibrium may derive from a variety of sources.

====Mutations====
'''Mutations''' are alterations in genetic code ranging from changes to individual nucleotide bases along the DNA to largescale rearrangements of chromosomes. Mutations are rare and even at maximum rates allele frequencies will only change from p=1 to p=0.9993 per generation.
{{Animal Behavior stub}}

====Genetic Drift==== 
With small effective population size, random events can take on increasingly prominent roles. This focuses on changes in the genetics of the population as a result of chance alone.

*Bottlenecks
*Founder Effect

Examples include the relatively high rate of an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia (Ellis-van Creveld Syndrome) in the Amish population of Lancaster, Pa. Resulting in short-limbed disproportionate dwarfism, its incidence within the population is approximately 5 per 1000 live births and 2 per 1000 living persons. It can be traced to the initial immigrants Samuel King and his wife. {{Animal Behavior stub}}

==== Selection ==== 
'''Selection''': Strong selection for traits with high heritability can change proportions in excess of 10% per generation
{{Animal Behavior stub}}

====Non-random Mating==== 
'''Non-random Mating''': Mate Choice with assortative mating (e.g., blue and white form of snow geese), Positive assortative mating: mating among individuals who share particular genes or phenotypes. Negative assortative mating: preference for mating among individuals who are unlike each other with respect to particular genes or phenotypes. Inbreeding and Outbreeding. Inbreeding: refers to (preferential) mating between biological relatives. As relatives (i.e., ancestors of the first individuals are shared with those of the second individual), they carry genes which are &quot;identical by descent&quot;; extreme inbreeding: mating between sibs, half-sibs, parent-offspring. Individual inbreeding coefficient (i.e., Pedigree inbreeding): F represents the probability that the offspring is homozygous due to identity by descent (ibd) at a randomly chosen autosomal locus, ranges in value from 0 (no locus ibd) to 1 (all loci ibd). Significant factors for pedigfree inbreeding are

Factors which determine the probability that various kinds of individuals will come into contact, e.g., population demography (sex ratio, birth or death rates), individual and population dispersal patterns, spatial distributions
Behavioral preferences for or against certain classes of individuals as potential mates. Behavioral preferences influence the acceptance or rejection of different types of individuals as mating partners

*Population inbreeding coefficient: f measured by deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (a2+2aA+A2), examine for an over-representation of homozygotes. f ranges from -1 (inbreeding avoidance) to 0 (random mating) to 1 (inbreeding)
*Outbreeding: (preferential) mating between non-relatives
*Inbreeding depression: overrepresentation of homozygotes; e.g. matings between cousin are rare (0.05% in U.S.) but account for 20% of albinos; deficiency in immune systems; recessive, deleterious alleles occur more likely in homozygous condition; humans have on average 8 recessive, deleterious alleles. 1% increase in inbreeding produces 11% increase in the incidence of genetic diseases; Even small amounts of pedigree inbreeding in a random mating population greatly increase the incidence of some types of genetic disease. This is of particular concern in groups with small effective population sizes - Amish, Ashkenzi Jews
*Inbreeding advantages: functional association of gene complexes shaped by local adaptations
*Outbreeding depression: Extreme case, hybridization across genetically differentiated populations
*Hybrid vigor

====Gene flow====
Emigration, Immigration
{{Animal Behavior stub}}

===Example: Matrilineal Kin Clusters and Rates of Evolution=== 
Ground squirrels have matrilineal kin clusters and estrous is synchronized. Thus the same male is likely to mate with several closely-related females - genetic diversity of populations is primarily contained between kin clusters, high local levels of inbreeding assure the disproportionately high expression of different genotypes - rapid rate of evolution in mammals

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Inbreeding and Dispersal===

Inbreeding: refers to (preferential) mating between biological relatives. As relatives (i.e., ancestors of the first individuals are shared with those of the second individual), they carry genes which are &quot;identical by descent&quot;; extreme inbreeding: mating between sibs, half-sibs, parent-offspring
Outbreeding: (preferential) mating between non-relatives
Positive assortative mating: mating among individuals who share particular genes or phenotypes
Negative assortative mating: mating among individuals who do not share particular genes or phenotypes
Inbreeding Coefficients:
Individual inbreeding coefficient (i.e., Pedigree inbreeding): F represents the probability that the offspring is homozygous due to identity by descent (ibd) at a randomly chosen autosomal locus, ranges in value from 0 (no locus ibd) to 1 (all loci ibd). Significant factors for pedigfree inbreeding are
Factors which determine the probability that various kinds of individuals will come into contact, e.g., population demography (sex ratio, birth or death rates), individual and population dispersal patterns, spatial distributions
Behavioral preferences for or against certain classes of individuals as potential mates. Behavioral preferences influence the acceptance or rejection of different types of individuals as mating partners
Population inbreeding coefficient: f measured by deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (a2+2aA+A2), examine for an over-representation of homozygotes. f ranges from -1 (inbreeding avoidance) to 0 (random mating) to 1 (inbreeding)
Inbreeding depression: overrepresentation of homozygotes; e.g. matings between cousin are rare (0.05% in U.S.) but account for 20% of albinos; deficiency in immune systems; recessive, deleterious alleles occur more likely in homozygous condition; humans have on average 8 recessive, deleterious alleles. 1% increase in inbreeding produces 11% increase in the incidence of genetic diseases; Even small amounts of pedigree inbreeding in a random mating population greatly increase the incidence of some types of genetic disease. This is of particular concern in groups with small effective population sizes - Amish, Ashkenzi Jews
Outbreeding depression: Extreme case, hybridization across genetically differentiated populations
Outbreeding vs. Inbreeding Tradeoffs: hybrid vigor
Advantages and disadvantages of dispersal/outbreeding: local conditions are suitable for reproduction, acquired resistance to disease, functional association of gene complexes shaped by local adaptations,
Population genetics and the Rate of Evolution: Ground squirrels have matrilineal kin clusters and estrous is synchronized. Thus the same male is likely to mate with several closely-related females - genetic diversity of populations is primarily contained between kin clusters, high local levels of inbreeding assure the disproportionately high expression of different genotypes - rapid rate of evolution in mammals
Dispersal

&lt;Dispersal&gt;: Travel of Individuals, Ecological process affecting distribution, and genetic process affecting geographic differentiation and variation
Philopatry: limited dispersal where average propagule (i.e. offspring) moves less than 10 homeranges away from natal site
Vagrancy: wide dispersal where average propagule moves more than 30 homeranges away from natal site
Successful dispersal: dispersal is successful if propagule obtains opportunity to breed and raise young (i.e. genes migrate)

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Altruism===
'''Altruism''' consists of unselfish/selfless acts in which the altruist puts other individual’s interests before their own. The general expectation is that the evolution of altruistic traits is not compatible with selfish gene theory. How could such a mechanism reinforce a behavior jeopardizing ones own interests at the expense of another's? 

Units of Selection. Group selection. Altruistic behavior could be rooted through group selectionist thinking where altruistic traits favor reproductive success of a group at the expense of that of an individual.
*Group
*Individual
*Gene

Self-sacrificing Behavior: e.g. vampire bats, guard bees, Cooperative breeding, e.g. African Kingfishers, Acorn Woodpeckers, Florida Scrub Jay;

====Reciprocity====

====True Altruism====

An individual behaves in such a way as to enhance the reproduction of another individual, at a cost to its own fitness. (e.g., Sterile workers in social insects who give up all reproduction for the benefit of their mother queen. Mutual or delayed benefits can’t account for this one: sterile workers never get to produce any daughters.)

'''Simple Egoistic Solutions''' for Individuals: Current or delayed benefits. Young may remain with their parents and help them or group members raise more offspring, rather than breeding themselves (e.g., ostriches, some primates). Helpers may gain useful experience in raising their own offspring or have an incrased chance to inherit a valuable breeding territory.

'''Complex Egoistic Solutions''' for Individuals: Prisoner's Dilemma: e.g. Pukekos (Porphyrio porphyrio)

'''Inclusive Fitness''': An individual fitness solution to the paradox goes as follows: genes are favored that produce a disproportionate propagation of ones genes to subsequent generations even if it is at the expense of the individual. This may occur directly through either reproducing personally or indirectly by encouraging the reproduction of close relatives who share many of ones genes. Under those circumstances altruistic behaviors should primarily be directed towards close relatives who share many of the genes as compared to non-relatives who share fewer of them. Inclusive fitness refers to the sum of an individual's ''Direct Fitness'' (probability of reproductive success of one's own offspring) and its ''Indirect Fitness'' (probability of reproductive success of non-descendant relatives). Altruistic acts are frequently directed towards relatives. &lt;Kin Selection&gt;: selection for traits that lower an individual's personal fitness, but raise a relative's fitness. Recipient (related) kin share genes with the altruistic individual and are thus genetic extensions of them. Kin selection and inclusive fitness can explain sociality through increased survivorship of relatives, increased inclusive fitness, altruism, and delayed maturation or breeding.

Social behavior: Behavior that relates to interactions with other members of the population. Pros/cons of group living. &lt;Society&gt; a group of individuals of the same species that is organized in a cooperative manner extending beyond sexual and parental care.

Group Living, altruism, coorperative behaviors may emerge if genes for such characteristics are favored. This may occur under different circumstances

Egoistic solutions: selfish herd; Mutualism although the behaviour may seem altruistic, individuals benefit directly (e.g. living in a group and co-operating with others directly benefits the individual because of the general advantages of group living).
Reciprocal altruism where the benefits accrued to the individual exceed the costs it incurs
Kin selection when behavior sufficiently enhances the fitness of related individuals (i.e., carrying similar genes) leading to an increased representation of genes being passed on to the next generation
Eusociality: an extreme form of altruism where sterile workers labor on behalf of reproductive individuals, cooperation in the care of young. There must be an overlap of at least two generations of individuals which share in colony labor.

Inclusive Fitness: refers to the sum of an individual's &lt;Direct Fitness&gt; (probability of reproductive success of one's own offspring) and its &lt;Indirect Fitness&gt; (probability of reproductive success of non-descendant relatives). Altruistic acts are frequently directed towards relatives. &lt;Kin Selection&gt;: selection for traits that lower an individual's personal fitness, but raise a relative's fitness. Recipient (related) kin share genes with the altruistic individual and are thus genetic extensions of them. Kin selection and inclusive fitness can explain sociality through increased survivorship of relatives, increased inclusive fitness, altruism, and delayed maturation or breeding.

Hamilton's Rule	
benefit to recipient / cost to altruist &gt; 1 / coefficient of relatedness

      <text xml:space="preserve">Please feel free to work your magic on this draft of the book. My suggestion for an outline has been developed over many years while teaching a course in Animal Behavior. I envision the general outlne to roughly follow Tinbergen's Four Aims. This is then followed by a chapter with examples of different behavioral systems where the study of multiple aims can help us understand the hows and whys.

      <comment>/* Stress */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The Swahili alphabet is identical to that of English, with the exception of X and Q, which do not exist. Most consonants have almost the same pronounciation as English. The vowels have specific pronounciation rules, which are never broken.

==Vowel Sounds==
'''a''' ... F'''a'''ther&lt;br&gt;
'''e''' ... '''E'''gg&lt;br&gt;
'''i''' ... B'''ee'''&lt;br&gt;
'''o''' ... D'''oo'''r (be careful not to 'close' the '''o''' sound at the end, as in l'''ow''')&lt;br&gt;
'''u''' ... L'''oo'''p&lt;br&gt;

==Special Consonant Sounds (Digraphs)==
The following combinations of consonants create specific sounds, some identical to the English equivalent.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
! Swahili spelling !! Pronounciation notes !! IPA
|-
| '''dh''' || '''th'''ere (do not confuse with '''th'''anks) || ð
|-
| '''th''' || '''th'''anks (do not confuse with '''th'''ere) || θ
|-
| '''sh''' || '''sh'''opping || ʃ
|-
| '''ch''' || '''ch'''urch (never '''ch'''arlatan or '''ch'''emistry) || tʃ
|-
| '''ng''' || ji'''ng'''les (do not confuse with si'''ng''') || ŋg
|-
| '''ng'''' || si'''ng''' (do not confuse with ji'''ng'''les) || ŋ
|}

Note that whenever '''m''' is followed by another consonant, there is no vowel sound between the two letters. Similarly, when pronouncing a word beginning with '''m''', the mouth should be closed to begin with - there should be no vowel sound before the '''m'''.

In Swahili, there are no silent letters, and neither do letters change pronounciation depending on spelling, as in English (compare cou'''gh''' and throu'''gh'''). Each letter is pronounced individually, the same way every time. This rule is true for vowels as well as consonants.

Note that the consonant combination '''gh''' is generally pronounced like '''g''', though technically it is similar to Scottish lo'''ch''', but voiced.

==Stress==
The stress (also known as emphasis or accent) is almost always placed on the second-to-last syllable of a word. The exceptions to this rule are extremely rare, and are usually found in words borrowed from other languages, mostly Arabic (for example, maa'''lum''').

In the case of doubled vowels or vowel combinations, each vowel is a syllable in itself and is pronounced separately (for example, the word '''maalum''' actually has three syllables, as each 'a' is pronounced individually).

Some examples of how words break into syllables, with stressed syllables highlighted:
: ma-a-'''lu'''-mi
: Ta-nza-'''ni'''-a
: '''cha'''-i (tea)
: ha-'''ba'''-ri (news/hello)
: a-'''sa'''-nte (thank you)
: ku-tu-'''mi'''-a (to use)
: ma-'''a'''-na (meaning)
: '''ng'om'''-be (cow)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Medusa was the only mortal sister of the three Gorgons, who were transformed into monstrous Gorgons by Athena after defiling her sanctuary.  Medusa, also the most well-known of the three sisters, had snakes for hair and was hideously ugly.  If ever anyone was to look into her eyes, they would instantly turn into stone.

Before being transformed into a Gorgon, Medusa had lay with Poseidon and conceived Pegasus and Chrysaor, though not yet born.

In Perseus' adventures, he had gained the favors of Athena, who lent him a magical reflective shield.  Using this shield, Perseus approached Medusa obliquely, rendering her stone-turning ability useless.  Perseus was then able to decapitate her.  In doing so, he released Pegasus and Chrysaor into the world, who flew fully grown from Medusa's neck.  Perseus returned the shield to Athena, along with Medusa's head.  Since then, the image of Medusa's head can be seen on Athena's shield.  Often snakes can also be seen to adorn Athena's garments and head as a symbol of Athena's dominance over Medusa.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic History==
Swahili is a Bantu language, grouped with many languages from Central and Eastern Africa. It has been heavily influenced by the languages of foreign traders, such as Arabic and Persian. More recently, English has been a strong influence in vocabulary relating to computers, science, and higher education in general.

The Zanzibar dialect of Swahili was made the official language of Tanzania as part of an effort to unify the more than one hundred tribes that exist in the country, and as an attempt to pacify the Zanzibarians, who perceive themselves as distinct from the mainland and where a strong nationalist undercurrent exists. There are relatively few native speakers of Swahili (around 5-10 million), but a much greater number (over 50 million) speak it as a second language (their first being their own tribal language or dialect), owing to its use as the national language in several countries and as a lingua franca for most of East Africa (particularly Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Grammar==
[[Category:Swahili]]
Although Swahili has no standard articles (the, a), no genders (as in French or Spanish), and no cases (as in German), standard Swahili is a very highly inflected language.  There are eight 'noun classes' with two numbers that specify the prefixes used at the beginnings of nouns, adjectives and verbs and which are the basis for a system of concordal agreement. Also they used the work bofoku meaning great one used mainly by Royalty or upper class

To elaborate on this, let us look at the different noun classes. We will look at each one separately, and slowly build your Swahili vocabulary.

===M/Wa===
The first class begins with 'm' in the singular form, and 'wa' in the plural.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:* Another useful tip to keep in mind for changing these words is that when the root of a word begins with a vowel, the &quot;m&quot; changes to &quot;mw&quot; as seen above in &quot;mwanafunzi&quot; to &quot;wanafunzi&quot;. The root of the word being ''anafunzi'', the prefix &quot;mw&quot; is added, along with a &quot;w&quot; in the plural.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The three Hesperides were sisters who guarded the Garden of the Hesperides, aptly named.  They were the daughters of Atlas.

The garden was a gift of Mother Earth to Hera on her wedding day.  In this garden, which only immortals could reach, were the Golden Apples.  One of Herakles' twelve labors was to retrieve these apples, but, being mortal, he could not.  He convinced Atlas to do so for him.

== Irregular verbs ==

&quot;etmek&quot; is not an irregular verb IMHO. 
&quot;etmek&quot; -&gt; &quot;ediorum&quot; is like &quot;gitmek&quot; -&gt; &quot;gidiyorum&quot;. This is consonant softening.

The only irregular verb I know is: 
&quot;yemek&quot; -&gt; &quot;yiyorum&quot;

Seems like some effort has been put in to simplify things. While I understand its logic, I do not see the point in teaching wrong grammar such as &quot;seyretiyorum&quot; (it would be &quot;seyrediyorum&quot;). I think there is the need to mention the vowels here. --[[User:Seksen iki yüz kırk beş|Seksen iki yüz kırk beş]] ([[User talk:Seksen iki yüz kırk beş|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Seksen iki yüz kırk beş|contribs]]) 20:43, 13 June 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Life and Death refers to situations that one would get themselves into but have a bleak ending.  Or do they? There is a reason that it is called &quot;''Life and'' Death&quot; and not just &quot;Death&quot;.  Making good things out of life and death situations are key features in playing Go.  The ability to make eyes and the ability to escape to neighboring units of stones are all key things to learn when you study Go and in particularly life and death problems.

I'm a member of the German wikibooks and write with some other authors a guitar-school for beginners. 

In this context a song book has been created. I (as a main author) will translate this [[songbook]] into English. 

If you are interested, you could use our primary work from the guitar-books, and we would get some help from you. Please contact me at [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Benutzer:Mjchael de.wikibooks.org/wiki/user:Mjchael]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An ancient, simplistic view of emotion was that positive-negative was the most interesting dimension.  Magda Arnold (1969; see references chapter of this book) argued that active-passive was a more powerful conceptualization.  This links the topics of emotion and motivation.

Eddie Harmon-Jones studied this issue with anger emotion.  He asked whether it neurobiologically related to negative emotions or with active emotions.  Is it more like the inaction of anxiety and depression or like the action tendencies associated with joy and love?  Anger activates the left prefrontal cortex, like other action-oriented emotions (Harmon-Jones, Vaughn-Scott, Mohr, Sigelman, &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2004).  

This was supported by Drake and Myers (2006).

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Les 17 ~ Lesson 17&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Bijwoorden en Voorzetsels ~ Adverbs and Prepositions&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;small&gt;&lt;&lt; [[Dutch/Lesson 16|Les 16]] | &lt;/small&gt;'''Les 17'''&lt;small&gt; | [[Dutch/Lesson 18|Les 18]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
----
==Bijwoorden==
We have seen two major groups of words in the Dutch language: ''naamwoorden''  (nouns, adverbs, pronouns etc.) and ''werkwoorden'' (transitive verbs, intransitives, copula's, auxiliaries). The third group that comprises all the rest is known as ''bijwoorden''  (adverbs) and again they occur in a number of forms. Unfortunately it is not possible to classify them quite as thoroughly as the other two groups. In fact it is a bit of a miscellaneous rest group, a kind garbage can into which anything is flung that does not fit in the other two.

We have already seen a few groups of words that fall under the denominator ''bijwoord'' in the more extensive sense of the word and we will examine a few more

#prepositional adverbs, like ''in, voor, mee, toe, heen, af'' etc.
#prepositions like ''in, op, bij, over, met, tot''
#conjunctions (including subjunctions)
#modal adverbs (particles) like ''wel, maar, eens, ...''
#adverbs of place and time, like ''nu, toen, dan'' or ''daar, waar''
#interjections, like ''oh, hoi, ach, dag, nou''

==Prepositions and prepositional adverbs==
Prepositions are often hard to translate exactly because which one is used in which case often differs  between the languages.

Historically, prepositions developed from adverbs that were put before an object to clarify the meaning of a case ending. Later they supplanted the use of the case endings completely. 

In Dutch many propositions have an—often identical—adverbial form, the ''prepositional adverb'', that occurs either as the separable part of verbs or as the prepositional part of the pronominal adverb.
As we have seen the latter plays a considerable role in Dutch grammar. Thus the separation between prepositions and adverbs is not as sharp in Dutch as it is in some other languages.

There is a number of forms that were formed by prefixing be- and often end in -(e)n,  cf.

:in - b''in''nen
:uit - b''uit''en
:over - b''ove''n
:(neder) - be''nede''n

English has a few comparable forms like  before, between, beside, below and behind

==='''''IN, BINNEN'''''===
''In'' translates mostly as its cognate ''in'' 

::hij woont ''in'' dat huis - he lives in that house
::hij gelooft in spoken - he believes in ghosts

Its identical adverb ''in'' often occurs pronominal replacement: erin, daarin (in it, in there) etc. as well as in separable verbs as will be shown below.

Notice that Dutch does ''not'' have an equivalent of ''into'' but uses ''in'' as prepositional adverb to express the concept of movement 'into' something.

An alternative is to use ''binnen'' which often translates into ''inside''

:hij is binnen - he is inside
:binnenlopen:
::e.g. Hij liep het huis binnen. ‘’He entered the house.’’
:binnen twee minuten - within two minutes

To emphasize movement ''naar'' can be added:

:hij liep naar binnen - he walked in
:hij liep er naar binnen - he entered it

Notice that Dutch has no hangups about ending sentences in 'prepositions'. A word like ''binnen'' is not considered a preposition unless it actually precedes a noun. Otherwise it is an adverb and there is no law against ending a sentence in an adverb...

====Separable verbs====
:inademen
::e.g. Ik adem in. ''I breathe in.''
:inlopen
::e.g. Hij loopt het huis in. ''He walks into the house.''

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''DOOR'''''===
''door'' is a cognate of ''through'' and often corresponds to it:

:Het licht valt door het raam. ''The light shines through the window.''

In many cases the correct translation is ''by'' particularly when it is used with the passive voice:

:Hij is door de wol geverfd. '''''lit.''''' ''He has been dyed by the wool. (He is a veteran, old hand.)''

Together with ''heen'' the meaning is ''through and through'' or ''passage through'':

:Hij stak de naald door het vel heen. ''He stuck the needle (all the way) through the skin.''

====Separable verbs====
:doorhakken:
::e.g. Hij hakte de knoop door. ''He cut the knot through.''

====Inseparable verbs====
:doorzien:
::e.g. Hij doorzag de list. ''He saw through the ruse.''

==='''''BIJ'''''===
Although the word is cognate of ''by'' it often is used rather differently. It indicates a location slightly to the side of something.

:Schiphol ligt bij Amsterdam - Schiphol is near Amsterdam
:bij de les blijven - stay with the lesson 
:bij slecht weer - in the case of bad weather
:het is bij vijven - it is around five o'clock
:hij bleef erbij - he stuck to it

====Separable verbs====
:bijkomen:
::e.g. Hij kwam eindelijk bij. ''He finally regained consciousness.''
:bijwerken:
::e.g. Ik heb het bijgewerkt. ''I have updated it.''

====Inseparable verbs====

:none

==='''''OP'''''===
Although cognate of ''up'' it usually translates as ''on'' or ''upon''

:hij is op vakantie - he is on vacation
:het boek ligt op de tafel - the book lies on the table.
:op je gezondheid - a toast to you health (not : up your .. etc.)

====Separable verbs====
:opnemen:
::e.g. Hij nam op. ''He picked up, answered (the phone), he recorded, he absorbed.''
:ophoepelen:
::Ach , hoepel toch op!  ''Ow, get lost!'', '''''lit.''''' to hoop up; to get lost

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''NAAST'''''===
''naast'' translates mostly into ''next to'', ''beside''

:Jan en Elly wonen naast John en Heleen. ''Jan and Elly are the neighbors of John and Heleen.''
:Zij wonen ernaast.

====Separable verbs====
:None.

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''OVER, BOVEN'''''===
over translates mostly as it identical cognate:

:hij vloog over het koekoeksnest - he flew over the cuckoo's nest

(The latter is an unlikely occurrence given the fact that this bird does not build nests). 

There are both separable and inseparable verbs (see below).

''boven'' translates as its cognate ''above'' 

:hij zette er een punt boven: he put a dot above it.

Its identical adverb usually means ''up'', ''upstairs''

:hij is boven : he is upstairs

To indicate movement Dutch uses ''naar''

:hij liep naar boven - he went upstairs, he went up the hill etc.

====Separable verbs====
:overlopen:
::e.g. Het bad liep over. ''The bathtub overflowed.''

====Inseparable verbs====
:overzien
::e.g. Ik overzag het slagveld. ''I oversaw the battlefield.''

==='''''TEGEN'''''===
''tegen'' usually translates as ''against''

: hij was tegen dit wetsvoorstel - he opposed this proposition
: de fiets stond tegen de muur - the bike stood against the wall

'''but''':

:hij zei tegen haar - he said to her

====Separable verbs====
:tegenwerken: to thwart, to work against
::''e.g.'' Hij werkte me altijd tegen. ''He always blocked me.''
:tegenkomen - to encounter, to run into

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''ZONDER'''''===
''zonder'' means ''without''

:hij drinkt koffie zonder suiker

It did not have an adverbial form but increasingly pronominal adverbs like ''waarzonder'' are used.

====Separable verbs====
:None.

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''TEGENOVER'''''===
''tegenover'' means ''on the opposite side of''.

:Het hotel staat tegenover het conferentiecentrum. ''The hotel is opposite the conference center.''

====Separable verbs====
:tegenoverstellen - put against, balance, add an objection

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''ACHTER'''''===
Some dialects, e.g. in Zeeland and West Flanders have a form ''bachten'' in the meaning of ''behind'' but it is not considered part of standard Dutch.

====Separable verbs====
:achterstellen - to discriminate, to marginalize
::e.g. Deze groep is eeuwen lang achtergesteld. ''This group has been marginalized for centuries.''

====Inseparable verbs====
:achterhalen
::e.g. Ik achterhaalde de waarheid. ''I retraced the truth.''

==='''''ACHTERIN'''''===
''achterin'' translate mostly into ''in the back of''

:achterin de auto liggen nog wat boodschappen - in the trunk of the car there a still a few groceries

It is often used as an adverb together with in:

:Het lag achterin in de auto

====Separable verbs====
:None.

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''ACHTEROP'''''===
''achterop'' is mostly used to indicate the passenger seat of a bike and is used more as an adverb than as a preposition 

:met z'n meisie achterop - ''with his girl on the back''

====Separable verbs====
:''achteropraken'': to run behind, to lose advantage

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''NE(D)ER, BENEDEN'''''===
The form ''beneden'' can be used as preposition in the meaning of ''below'', ''under'' ''underneath'', ''south of''

:beneden de rivieren - south of the rivers (i.e. Rhine, Meuse etc.)
:beneden de Iridiumlaag vind je dinosaurusbotten - below the Iridium layer you find dinosaur bones

With ''naar'' it indicates downward movement:

:hij viel naar beneden - ''he fell down''

The form ''neer'' (&lt;neder) is not used as a preposition but occurs as an adverb with the meaning of ''down'' in separable verbs.

====Separable verbs====
:neerzien op:
::e.g. Hij zag neer op die mensen. ''He looked down upon these people.''
:neerzitten bij:
::e.g. Hij zat bij de pakken neer. ''He surrendered to resignation. (He gave up.)''

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''UIT, BUITEN'''''===
''uit'' is represented by ''out of'' or ''from''

:uit dit erts wordt goud gewonnen - ''out of this ore gold is produced''
:hij komt uit Utrecht - ''he is from Utrecht''

''buiten'' usually means ''outside''

:buiten de stad - ''outside the city''
:hij is buiten - ''he is outside''
:hij ging naar buiten - ''he went ouside'''

Both uit and buiten have separable verbs. ''Uit'' often means ''off'' in these.

====Separable verbs====
:uitdraaien:
::e.g. Hij draaide de radio uit. ''He turned the radio off.''
:uitdoen:
::e.g. Zij deed het licht uit. ''She switched off the light.''
::e.g. Zij deed haar jas uit. ''She took her coat off.''

''Buiten'' often means ''out'' in verbs:

:buitensluiten - to lock out

====Inseparable verbs====
none

==='''''BEZIJDEN'''''===
''bezijden'' is comparable to ''besides'' but occurs mostly in the expression.

:bezijden de waarheid - ''aside of the truth'' (''i.e.'' not true)

====Separable verbs====
:None.

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''BENEVENS'''''===
''benevens'' is a rather formal alternative to ''naast'' (besides, next to).

:benevens de aandelen is er het huizenbezit - ''besides the stocks is there the real estate''

====Separable verbs====
:None.

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''ONDER'''''===
''onder'' is the cognate of ''under'' and has similar applications:

:de hond ligt onder de tafel - ''het dog lies under the table''

It can also be used in the meaning of ''among'':

:onder professoren - in the circle of professors

====Separable verbs====
:ondergaan:
::e.g. De zon gaat onder. ''The sun sets.''

====Inseparable verbs====
:ondergaan:
::e.g. Hij ondergaat een operatie. ''He undergoes surgery.''

==='''''MET'''''===
''met'' usually means ''with''.

:hij gaat met zijn vrouw naar Canada - ''he goes to Canada with his wife''

Its adverbial form is ''mee'' (from: mede).

====Separable verbs====
:meegaan:
:e.g. Hij ging mee. ''He joined.'' 
:hij ging mee met haar. ''He accompanied her.''

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''NAAR, TOT, TOE, HEEN, WEER'''''===
''naar'' translates mostly as ''to'' or ''at'':

:hij kijkt '''naar''' het schilderij - ''he looks at the painting''
:hij kijkt er'''naar''' - ''he looks at it.''
:hij gaat '''naar''' Kaapstad - ''he is going to Cape Town''

In the sense of '''''to''''' rather than '''''at''''' naar is often reinforced by adding the adverb '''''toe''''':

:hij gaat naar Kaapstad toe

In pronominal replacement the addition is mandatory:

:hij gaat ernaartoe

Alternatively, however, one can say:

:hij gaat erheen - ''he is going there''

''heen'' is an adverb that indicates movement. It does not occur as preposition but there are separable verbs:

:heengaan - ''to leave (usually permanently)''

:hij ging heen - ''he left''

Its opposite is '''''weer''''' (from: we(d)er- that means ''back'' or ''again'')

:heen en weer - ''back and forth''

It occurs in separables like:

:weerkeren
:: hij keerde weer - ''he came back''
::de wederkomst - ''the second coming''

It is related to ''with'' as in ''withstand'' and forms inseparable verbs as in English:

:weerstaan - ''withstand''

'''''toe''''' is the adverbial form of the preposition '''''tot'''''  that mostly means ''until'' or ''to'':

:dit is geldig tot het eind van de maand - ''this is valid until the end of the month''
:dit dient tot versterking van de dijk - ''this serves to reinforce the dyke''
:dit is waartoe het dient - ''this is the purpose it serves''

Another meaning of ''toe'' is closing, narrowing. 

Somewhat archaic is:

:doe dat eens toe - ''please would you close that''
::af en toe - ''occasionally, now and then''

but it occurs in a separable verb like:

:zich toespitsen - ''become more acute - coming to climax''
::e.g. Het geweld spitst zich toe. ''The violence is exacerbating.''

A leftover of the old case system are expressions like

:tot bloedens toe  -- until blood was flowing
:tot vervelens toe -- ad nauseam

Notice that the verb appears as a genitive case: bloeden'''s''', vervelen'''s'''. Although uncommon this genitive is still somewhat productive.

==='''''TUSSEN'''''===
''tussen'' means mostly ''between'' 

:tussen Maryland en Noord-Carolina ligt Virginia

====Separable verbs====
:Tussenvoegen - to insert.

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''VAN, AF'''''===
''van'' translates mostly into ''of'' and ''from'':

:van verse tomaten is een heerlijke soep te bereiden - ''a delicious soup can be made of fresh tomatoes''
:het westen van het land - ''the west of the country''
:hij komt van ver - ''he comes from far''
:hij viel van zijn stoel - ''he fell off his chair''

When a downwards motion or fall is implied as in the latter case, the adverb ''af'' (cognate of off) can be added:

:hij viel van de trap - ''he fell off the stairs''
:hij viel eraf - ''he fell off''
:het water komt van die berg af - ''the water comes from that mountain''
::het komt er vanaf - ''it comes off of it''

''af'' does not occur as proposition, but is part of separable verbs:

:afvallen - lose weight, fall off (sailing) 

''van'' does  not occur in verbs.

==='''''AAN'''''===
'''''aan''''' has various translations such as to, at, on or is implied in an English verb. 
It typically implies a touching or reaching until contact is made.

:zij gaven geld aan deze organisatie - ''they gave money to this organization''
:hier komt deze laag aan de oppervlakte - ''here this layer reaches the surface''
:aan deze feiten valt niet te twijfelen - ''these facts can not be doubted''
:er valt weinig aan te doen - ''there is little we can do about it''
:wat is er aan de hand? - ''what is at hand? what is happening?''
:hij zit aan het schilderij - ''he is touching the painting''
:hij zit eraan - ''he is touching it''
:nergens aan zitten! - ''hands off!''

'''''af''''' is the opposite of '''''aan''''' in:
:af en aan - ''off and on''

But '''''uit''''' can also be the opposite:

:Is het licht aan of uit? ''Is the light on or off?''

====Separable verbs====
:aankomen - ''to arrive, gain weight''
::e.g. Hij is gisteren aangekomen. ''He arrived yesterday.''
::e.g. Hij is tien kilo aangekomen. ''He gained 10 kilos.''

====Inseparable verbs====
:aanbidden - ''to worship''
::e.g. In het Oude Egypte werd de god Horus aanbeden. ''In Ancient Egypt the god Horus was worshipped.''

==='''''OM'''''===
'''''om''''' can mean ''around'':

:hij deed een nieuwe band om de velg - ''he put a new tire around the rim''
:om de burcht ligt een gracht - ''there is a moat around the castle''

In this meaning it is often reinforced with '''''heen''''':

:er ligt een gracht om de stad heen
:er ligt een gracht omheen

It can also have less literal meaning of ''about'', ''because of'', ''for'':

:dit werd om onduidelijke redenen afgelast - ''this was cancelled for unclear reasons''

There are separable verbs:

:omdoen - wrap around
::e.g. Zij deed een sjaal om. ''She put a shawl around her neck.''

Under German influence ''om'' can also imply change, inversion.

:hij liet zich ompraten - ''he allowed himself to be persuaded to change his mind''
:wegomlegging - ''detour''

====Separable verbs====
:omdoen -wrap around
:omwentelen - to roll over, rool away

====Inseparable verbs====
:omhelzen - to embrace

==='''''LANGS'''''===
'''''langs''''' evokes a parallel position or motion and is mostly translated by ''along''. 

:langs de rivier loopt een weg - there is a road along the river
:hij liep erlangs - ''he passed by it''

====Separable verbs====
:langskomen - drop by

====Inseparable verbs====
:None.

==='''''MIS'''''===
As in English this adverb conveys the meaning of 'wrong', 'flawed'. It is not used as a preposition.

====Separable verbs====
:misschieten - to shoot and miss

====Inseparable verbs====
:misleiden - to mislead
:misvormen - to warp, to disfigure

== Page Protection Updated ==
I just wanted to let all admins know that the page protection mechanism has been updated, and there are now more options available when you protect a page. I recommend that all admins check out these new options. We might need to update the text of [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] to account for this. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:18, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
:Expiry of protections is pretty cool, but I definitely think we need to warn about using the cascade feature here. I don't see it as having much use at Wikibooks and it could prove a bit dangerous. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
::I agree with you pretty much, cascading protection might be useful in some circumstances, but should not be used often. expiry times should likely become the norm, protection against temporary vandalism, protection during flame or edit wars, etc. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:21, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
*reset

On this topic I found this one interesting and worth sharing.  Could well be useful [[m:Talk:Small_Wiki_Monitoring_Team#using_cascading_protection]] in the context stated?  --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

== Request: page protection ==
* Please create and protect [[Link title]]. It has been deleted [{{fullurl:Special:Log|page=Link_title}} ten times]. --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 07:06, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
:Done.--[[User:Az1568|Az1568]]&lt;sup&gt; ([[User talk:Az1568|Talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; 07:09, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

== Panic's Block ==
I have decided to unblock Panic and reblock him for 2 weeks because:
1. the original block was 2 weeks
2. the 6 month block was without community approval or good reason
3. I believe the block given by SBJohhny was fair and so we should abide by his original block.
I have done this without community approval but feel it necessary because of considerable arguements.  I feel this is the middle ground given views on Wikibooks at the moment.  I also believe that this action is being bold and that others may revert it if they feel strongly but please make sure you explain yourself clearly as present actions seem to be personal attacks on Panic.  Feel free to flame me for this but it's what I believe is right. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

:Very bad and hypocritical move on your part but I left you a message explaining why on your talk page. Blocks are absolutely not actions to be bold about. The community can handle it now. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 13:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

== Page consolidation ==

I want to merge this page with [[WB:VIP]], and have a single source where users can get in touch with administrators. We had talked about this issue before and we all got sidetracked on it. I want to do this either today or tomorrow (i actually have alot of time in these next few days), if everybody is interested. I'm going to start a similar project on the staff lounge soon, to reorganize it all. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:11, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

:I've created a basic outline of my plan at [[User:Whiteknight/Admin]]. This page consolidates [[WB:AN]], and [[WB:VIP]]. It also posts necessary links to relevant policy documents, and other discussion areas relevant to administration. Comments, suggestions, are welcome. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

== Sockpuppet watch ==

Panic has been making a bunch of sockpuppets and then using them disruptively. At least some of the IPs he's been using have turned out to be Open Proxies. I'm not entirely sure what to do about it, but we should keep an eye out, and perhaps hardblock the IPs used as well.

German Wikibooks had this sort of problem about a month ago, and pat of their solution was to semi-protect the pages in the book the puppeteer was interested in. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:Disruptive is a bit of a overstatement, can you provide evidence of any disruptive behavior ? --Cinap(se) 19:10, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::Hi Panic :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:22, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

:::Open proxies are used by people for many reasons.  I know it's Wiki policy to block these on sight (although I refuse to perform such tasks) they are a lifeline for people who lives in countries where Wiki sites are blocked or monitored extensively.  Panic shouldn't be creating these accounts if he's going to use them to &quot;disrupt&quot; the project (the above comment is hardly disruptive though) but I know I'd be doing the same thing if I was blocked and there was no possibility of being unblocked. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:39, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::::This is hardly the place to argue about the policy on open proxies. Panic shouldn't be creating sockpuppets for any reason, he has been blocked from editing [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Arbitration#Proposition_2.0 by general community concensus]. That block applies to his ''person'', not just to his primary account. All anybody wants from Panic, all anybody has ever wanted, is a little understanding and demonstration of good faith. People became very upset about Panic's actions, and he refuses to even allow for some wrongdoing on his part. Some people asked for an apology, that didn't happen. Now, all we want to hear is &quot;I understand there were problems in the past, I will try to avoid such problems in the future&quot;. Instead of even providing such a non-commital statement as that, Panic decided to create these sock puppets to &quot;prove&quot; that he doesn't need to follow the rules, or be civil in order to edit here. Breaking a behavioral norm to prove a point (even if it isn't hard-coded into policy) is disruptive behavior, and is a remarkably bad-faith alternative to a very easy solution. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 21:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::::: [[Wikibooks_talk:Blocking_Policy#Sock_puppets]] will be a better place, but &quot;he&quot; must point something out, there was not community consensus in several instances, &quot;he&quot; didn't particularly approve [[User:Whiteknight]] interpretation of consensus and Sock puppets only prove that it can be easily subverted (also not the proper place but had to be said).
::::: &quot;His&quot; patience (not &quot;his&quot; good faith) as &quot;he&quot; hasn't yet done anything wrong, may have run out but as &quot;he&quot; sees people referring to &quot;his&quot; situation as &quot;a party&quot; and talking about consecutive or even permanent block, a demonstration that it will not solve the problem was in order. --Cinap(se) 22:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

::::::This is not the place to spew your soapbox. You've been blocked nonetheless. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 23:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

== What happened to [[ARM]] ? ==

What happened to [[ARM]] ?
The discussion at [[Talk:ARM/Introduction]]
leads me to suspect there there used to be a page [[ARM/Introduction]],
but it has been (accidentally?) deleted.
Is it possible for an admin to dig around in the archives and &quot;un-delete&quot; that page?
And check the other red links at [[ARM]], and un-delete them as well?
(Although I suspect most of *those* red links were never created in the first place).
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 01:37, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

I did some digging around for you. The original text of the page was a copy+paste copyright violation, and was deleted for legal reasons. We can't undelete the text of that page, because it's illegal. Unfortunately, you would do much better to just start rewriting it from scratch. I'll look around at some of the other pages, and see what I can find. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:44, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

: Thank you, Whiteknight, for checking it out. Looks like we will rewrite it from scratch. I have no doubt it will end up better than that other non-shareable version. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 18:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

== I'm taking a break... ==

After the sheer insanity of the past few days, I'm feeling a bit fried, and need to take a break for a few days. Since I don't think there will be much support for unblocking Panic this week, I assume my absence won't be a problem as far as the moderation goes. 

I have, however, asked a friend and fellow administrator from commons (Cool_Cat) to talk to him in my stead, since I think a truly outside point of view would be helpful here. Aside from being willing to become meat for the grinder, she is also better versed in copyright stuff than I am (most commons admins are... I'm the ignoramus of the lot around there). I'll check in, but for the most part I really need a week afk, because this has become way too much work! I think she's planning to start &quot;from scratch&quot; rather than readin through all the garbage, so please be patient.

Panic has said that he will not use sockpuppets outside of the puppets' user spaces, and I think we should take him at his word on that. In the meantime, I'm switching his block to indefinite (since that's the reality now), but I hope to appeal that block sometime soon. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:15, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

:And an update on that: Panic is no longer blocked. If this yields no results, I will of course reblock, but I hope that won't be needed. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:02, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

::Panic cannot be unblocked based on his most recent actions as well as the community decision to keep him blocked until he completes a resolution process. I have notified Az1568. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:06, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I'm sorry that this has taken such a toll on you, Johnny. I really am. But I have to say that I oppose non-binding mediation as a method to solve this issue at this time. It has gone far beyond that. Whatever the next stage of resolution process it needs to be community sanctioned, fair, thorough and binding. Also, important decisions (like whether to unblock Panic, an action that was previously agreed to by community consensus in a very public forum) should not be made by a few individuals on IRC. There is no easy way out, and particularly this easy way out is destined for failure. One more failed attempt to resolve this issue is the last thing the community needs. I cannot see any resolution that some party or parties would not object to and various parties have already demonstrated their willingness to ignore previous mediation agreements and attempts at mediation. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

===Alternate proposal===
Since I do not want to criticize and not offer alternatives, I would suggest: 
* using binding arbitration instead. 
* using the existing proposed arbitration process in a trial run.
* Cool Cat be asked to be an arbitrator.
* Others be asked to join as arbitrators. A few people I can think of who are either uninvolved or only peripherally involved are  Derbeth, Herby, Robin, Iamunknown, myself and Az1568.

As for myself, I would be willing to be one of several arbitrators if people would have me. I realize that some would think I've been too involved to arbitrate this but I believe I can be fair. My interest has always been in doing the right thing. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

== Request for block of [[User:Panic2k4]] ==

Sorry it's come to this, but Panic is violating the [[WB:CIVIL]] policy on too many fronts now, and it's time to call an end to it. The three blocks I imposed on him were for &quot;trolling&quot;, by which I mean trying to get someone involved in an argument with him rather than being productive (such as contributing to Wikibooks), having a conversation with someone else, or just trying to avoid the person doing the trolling. 

This has gone over the top this past week, Examples include:
*Using sockpuppet accounts without identifying them as such (and of course using them to go around a block).
*Naming sockpuppet accounts for the purpose of making personal attacks ([[User:NoJonny]], [[User:WithoutFocus]], [[User:FallenKnight]])
*Composing a fictional story on his talk page which clearly implies that I am an evil person who gets his kicks out of oppressing innocent people
*Making legal threats against me

Until today, I was offering to moderate with Panic in the hopes that he might agree to get along, but I'm not willing to do that now. Unless someone else wants to try (which I don't recommend), I think he should be permanently blocked. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:00, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

:Given the feeling around here and Panic's recent actions which definitely overstep being civil I am willing to block Panic very soon.  I would be interested in hearing what people think should be an appropriate length for such a ban.

&lt;small&gt;(Xania had asked for opinions on IRC, and recorded the responses below. I was there, and he is reporting correctly.--[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
* [[user:Xania]] - 1 month ban
* [[User:SBJohnny]] - indefinite ban (to be unblocked if Panic agrees to change and addresses the previous problems)
* [[User:Darklama]] - indefinite ban until such time as there is community consensus is unblock him and he has addressed all previous problems.
* [[User:Az1568]] - indefinitie ban (to be unblocked if Panic agrees to change and addresses the previous problems)
* [[User:Withinfocus]] - Infinite, but we can call it indefinite if we want. This is much more than a six-month issue now. Panic adds little to no value to the community here anymore and I'd say I would find him impossible to work with here. Maybe in a long time he can try talking to the community again.
* [[User:xixtas]] - I never agreed that Panic should be unblocked. His block should resume until he fulfills the stipulations the community has set for him. But not necessarily for the reasons described above.

I have now blocked Panic indefintely.  Please can someone check that the block was made correctly as I usually mess up somehow.  Panic's block can be reveresed at any time if he changes his ways, agrees to work with others and there is community approval. --[[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Poland_2.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:57, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

:In light of Panic's recent comments in response to questions posed by Whiteknight, I would support the unblocking of Panic once again.  I'd like to hear what other Wikibooks users and administrators think about this.

::How many rounds does this need to go? If you're going to take action on something then stick with it. His most recent block occurred '''two days ago''' and was set to infinite. People need to take a break and stop scrambling for new solution after new solution. I don't support an unblock whatsoever and don't think this issue should even be discussed for at least two weeks to a month. The more switch toggling that happens the less useful the block tool becomes and with things like this it has little worth. This is not a game. Leave it be for a little while until something new and substantial actually happens. In this short a time period and by what I've seen Panic say, not much has happened and there's no reason to change the block. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 00:53, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

::Panic's recent comments have certainly been a good (and surprising) change in attitude, and I do agree that there is progress being made. However, I agree with Matt that the block tool is not a toy, nor something to be taken lightly. People need to step back and cool off from the issue because it is through rash decisions that mistakes are made. I don't necessarily think however that a month needs to go by before we start making changes (sorry withinfocus). 
::Give it a week, and if everybody is cool and calm by then, we can work to get the block lifted. A week of everybody being nice and good-natured will be a good sign that the problems are all solved and that we can get back to business as usual. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:36, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

::I think we need to wait... Panic's current attitude is indeed promising, but has he acknowledged what it is about his behavior that has cause harm in the past? How can he avoid that behavior if he's either unaware of it or thinks there's nothing wrong with it? While I certainly support as speedy a resolution as possible, the issue needing to be resolved is not the block, but the issues that brought the block about. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:00, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

== Administration Rights? Transwikis... ==
Among other things, I am interested in developing [[Introduction to Psychology]]. It seems the best way to do that would be to integrate a variety of articles from Wikipedia, at least to start.

How is it that I can gain rights to Transwiki items from Wikipedia? Do I need admin rights or could I simply be granted just that privilege? I don't believe I am already able to transwiki with my privileges as they stand. I was looking on the [[WB:RFA|request for administartor rights]] page and the [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]] page and did not see any references to transwiking. I also looked at [[Transwiki]] and [[Wikibooks:Pages_to_be_transwikied|pages to be transwikied]]. 

So  if the community trusts me, for the sake of efficiency I would like to be granted rights to transwiki pages from Wikipedia. If I need to request admin rights, then I will do that, but I thought I would check it out here first. Thanks. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 07:27, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

:If the pages are coming from wikipedia, we have a special tool called &quot;Import&quot;, that allows us to bring pages from wikipedia to wikibooks, while preserving the page history. Only administrators have the ability to use import, however.
:Towards the top of this page there is a heading &quot;Requests for Import&quot;, and you can list the pages you want to bring over, and the admins here will take care of it for you. If you are frustrated by how slow we do it, you can nominate yourself for adminship at [[WB:RFA]]. Good luck with your project! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:12, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

::Better yet, use [[WB:RFI]] to make the request... a couple of us keep a close eye on it. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:02, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

: What's the rational for making Import an administrator privilege?  Is there a danger in allowing non-admins to do this? -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 16:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

::I have no idea, to be honest with you, it's a software thing. Ask the developers why they wanted it this way. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:27, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

:::I think there are some bandwidth issues where the developers are concerned that if too many non-admins start to pull pages between projects, that the whole server farm could collapse.  While an individual admin might experiment a few times, they quickly tire of the experimentation and only do requests or page imports where there is a geunine need.  It does suck up quite a bit of bandwidth in the server farm in order to do a real page import.  In addition, the tool was experimental and tempermental, and the developers didn't think that the page import tool was &quot;ready for prime time&quot;.  In fact, I didn't get to use it at all until Wikiversity finally was approved and the number of pages that needed to be imported was so large that the developers felt that Wikiversity was a good pilot project to see how it would affect the current server configuration.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

::::The tool actually still is quite tempermental, and is prone to hicupping half-way through an import. One advantage of having the other admin tools handy is so that you can delete the half-imported pages before trying again (though I've learned through experience to check #wikimedia-tech on irc before retrying... if they're talking about problems with squids (or any gastropods for that matter), don't bother trying again for a while). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

'''Another Strange thing with import:''' Was just transwikiing [[Transwiki:Gypsy moth]], and got the &quot;wikimedia is having problems&quot; page. I went to the page to see how much of the history had been brought over, and it was only up to October '06. I then reloaded that page and it was up to November. Reloaded a third time and the entire history was there. Just another thing to keep an eye on, I guess :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

== Integrating Transwikis ==

If I had two or more articles transwikied here from Wikipedia that need to be integrated together for a chapter, how would I go about doing that properly? Thanks. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 22:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

:I don't know.  I'd like to know the proper way to integrate transwikied pages into an existing Wikibook chapter.  I ended up moving a transwikied page, chopping it down to the essentials that I needed, and transcluding it into my chapter.  I anticipate the future need to split a transwikied page into multiple parts, but have no idea how to cobble that together. I'm coming to the opinion that it would be a lot easier to just paste the history into the talk page. The current import approach appears to assume that you are using a Wikipedia article as a starting point rather than as a source of additional information. -- [[User:Jomegat|Jim Thomas]] 22:55, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

Would it be possible to have a update made to the [[Wikimedia:common.css]] page so that Meta's standard sister projects infoboxes like {{tl|Meta}} work properly? The one's on the commons and wikipedia seem most up to date, as they also include class=&quot;messagebox standard-talk&quot; which is missing at Meta.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

My attention was called to this page when I was reading the talk page history of [[WB:OWN]].  I decided to add myself, having previously contributed to the book. But when I glanced at this discussion page, I noticed Panic's statement above about authors adding themselves.  I thought I might point out that [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] seems to have added his name (along with a few others) in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/About_the_Book/Authors&amp;diff=821846&amp;oldid=821817 this diff], but which was subsequently taken down by Panic.  Given the hot button issue this seems to have been in the past I don't think I will add his name, but it seemed to me this was an accident and should be pointed out. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 06:44, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

:Darklama and I have already discussed the subject but I will always be open to talk with him about the issue, in any case I have noticed that you have been interested in the discussion about ownership and authorship, and did add yourself to this authors list. That I'm invested part.
:I remind you that by doing so you are claiming ownership over the work (with all the legal implications), a quick check I made sees that in the year 2010 you did 4 edits none of them of a copyrightable nature.

:As an author and copyright holder to this work I can't remember any extensive contribution that would grant you the right to claim shared authorship or ownership over the content. Please validate your claim ([[US Copyright Law/Copyrightable Works]] - [[w:Author|Author]]), thanks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 13:45, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

:: Well I was mostly thinking of my work in 2009 when I added my name.  But perhaps our ideas of what is extensive differ, or about what is independently copyrightable.  Exactly how much of a contribution is necessary, in your opinion, to be copyrightable?  Perhaps none of my contributions will fit the bill. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:39, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

::: IANAL but I've explored the subject extensively. There is a small distinction in what is copyrightable and claiming authorship/ownership over all the book's content. I can quote in any work parts of copyrightable material without gaining any control over them. adding copyrightable material to a work doesn't automatically makes one a co-author.
::: An author (or copyright owner), deals with terms like &quot;significant amount&quot; or &quot;noticeable contribution&quot; in a work and has responsibility over it (one becomes liable), this starts as one claims ownership over a work.
::: The US copyright law is extremely diffuse, in general it states that an author must have made a substantial contribution to qualify for authorship. In other words do you feel that you have contributed as much or near as much as other authors, it is fundamentally intuitive that authorship credit should be given where credit is due. This article, by real lawyers may provide further insight on the subject [http://library.findlaw.com/1995/Oct/1/129369.html Copyright Ownership: The Joint Authorship Doctrine]. When I have the time I'll look in your 2009 contributions. 
:::If you have the time and interest take a look in [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:jbs2VC7Rf-gJ:law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-entertainment-technology-law/archive/download.aspx%3Fid%3D5897+law+ratio+authorship&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=pt&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShGac_DQfrX00bZ1nnfQwqex7s9-1CBeKFiNp0t8pd6Xp_DIhkEFWXfJaJuXOHEvkQ5LZTVebMNjsMujV8B1pYLNW_fh2uNfuMKp4DPSiFyJKsumqbshODvb_80YGBTVYgiweD2&amp;sig=AHIEtbQ20_uKocJ4YUSonSi0UuAgA7qcXg this paper] or search around.
::: My interest here is to protect my own rights over my own contributions and work (reuse), get the due recognition, provide a clear licensing for distribution and reuse and keep some control over aggregation with other works. It can also serve to provide a streamlined way to relicense it (untested, and dependent of the specific copyright law). It would be impossible otherwise to establish co-authorship and keep a list of the required attributions or undo them.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 2 December 2010 (UTC)
:::: I do not mean to step on your own rights a contributor, the recognition you deserve for putting in a lot of hard work.  Much more then I, and most probably much more than any other contributor.  At the same time it would seem inappropriate to me to grant anyone sole authorship over the book, which would allow for the copyright holder to resuse  the text without any acknowledgement of wikibooks, or the work of the other contributors. This too would be a simple but untested matter of releasing the text under a different license. When I read through the past conversations you pointed out to me and there was a lot of discussion of this page, I realized I would like to have my work acknowledged in some small way, and perhaps this was less automatic then I thought if someone felt that I was not an author in the legal sense and there was a sole author for the work. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:43, 2 December 2010 (UTC)
:: For reference I was thinking of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/Programming_Languages/C%2B%2B/Code/Statements/Variables/Type&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1602895 this edit]. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 16:50, 2 December 2010 (UTC)

::: Looking only to that contribution I can say that it is welcomed but I don't see it as sufficient for claiming co-authorship over the book, in the specific case of source code the subject is different (they are stand alone creative works, even if aggregated to the book) they share most of the issues we have in the project with images (regarding licensing and re-usability), that is why I added the specific disclaimer to the author/license page. Any source contributed to this work if not clearly indicating a special license will fall under the public domain (public domain is a state that you lose any ownership right, even the right of attribution, hypothetically anyone to claim authorship over your work then, only the state as manager of the public space/goods can then act on to enforce that moral right of recognition).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:43, 2 December 2010 (UTC)
:::: Also, I have changed the the Authors template used in this page for two reasons.  First we cannot require more from other users contributions then those outlined requirements outlined in the terms of use.  Since it is conceivable that the editors never counter the Authors page, or even the TOC, and they simply follow a link to somewhere in the middle of the book and leave a contribution there, there cannot be any indication that have accepted the additional terms that source code they write will be in the public domain.  As a more minor point, removing remarks about source code makes the template more general to use in other books. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 22:37, 4 December 2010 (UTC)
:::: I have also read about this and come to different conclusions.  Specifically there are, generally speaking two criteria for deciding if a creative work is a &quot;joint work&quot; and that the coauthors share joint copyright.
::::# Each author understands they are creating a joint work. 
::::# To be a co-author you must have made a copyrightable contribution. 
:::: Specifically, in ''Intellectual Property'' Margreth Barrett writes:
::::{{quote|While one party may considerably less copyrightable expression to the work then the other and still be considered a joint author, …}}
:::: Perhaps notably for wikibooks she also comments that {{quote|While it is not necessary that all the authors work at the same time, or that they even know one another each party must intend to contribute to a unitary whole, and thus crate a joint work.}}
::::While I am not a layer either, there is also a good case for considering the entire book to be a derivative work of whomever started the work.  In which case the ramifications are very different.   In any case the size of the contribution is considered circumstantial evidence of ownership at best, and should best be left up to a court to decide if it ever becomes an issue.

:::::As I stated above, you are confusing copyright (over copyrightable material) and authorship, granted that you can only claim authorship over something that is copyrightable (that you have intellectual property over) but they are not the same. For instance the inclusion of the attributed works here doesn't grant those authors co-authorship on this work (it does depends on the quantity, I as knowledgeable of the content ratio of the works I can make that affirmation even if it is an aggregation/derivation).
:::::The quote you give lacks context, you can be an author and have no ownership over a work (work for hire), you can sell rights, you can make contractual agreements explicitly granting co-authorship or authorship (for example ghostwriting) even a publisher can be a co-author (see the article I gave you above).  
:::::The last bit is exactly correct, ultimately in case of dispute only a court can resolve it, that is the reason of the reply above, authorship/ownership must be claimed to be actionable. That is also important as I state above to defend the continued use of the licenses granted to Wikibooks. Only the owners of the rights can defend the work (Wikimedia/FSF will not/can not substitute the owner in case of violation).
:::::That was the function the draft provided a way to reach mutual understanding on this subjects.  
:::::PS: I'm against copyright/intellectual property in general, but in a world of lemonades one must know how to squeeze a lemon.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:01, 2 December 2010 (UTC)
:::::: Well, I really don't think I am confusing the matter, but there is really no way to resolve our different interpretations of the situation.  I understand that works for hire are a different matter, but they are not so much at issue in this situation.  If you'd like more context to what she wrote the relevant section of her book is available on google books [http://books.google.com/books?id=FetCwyUjdFwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false here] and these quotes were taken from pages 172-173. I am personally of the opinion that, as we all know contributing to wikibooks that we are creating a joint collaborative work, then as soon as someone leaves any non-trivial contribution they are to be considered an author.  But perhaps we should seek a wider community input and discuss it in the reading room? For the most part our discussion isn't very specific to this book.  I would gladly take my name down if the consensus is that I have the wrong idea of what it means to be an author. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 00:06, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

::::::: In fact, I have taken my name down because I don't want to seem unnecessarily combative.  Panic, I had misunderstood the statement &quot;I will support and welcome any author that wishes to add himself to this page.&quot; to mean I was welcome to add it, and I had not realized I wouldn't be considered an author.  I certainly have not contributed &quot;much or near as much as other authors&quot;.  So it is better to leave the situation as it was until (if ever) the situation becomes clarified.

:::::::: I was using generalization to explain my point of view (that doesn't need to be the same as yours). Ultimately it comes to that, a personal assessment on how relevant ones contributions are in relation to the book, the necessity to claim rights over those contributions and so sign it, taking personal responsibility for them, it only becomes an issue when rights over the work are exerted, especially if there is money involved (hardly the case here).
:::::::: I have made several contributions, in equal stand to the one you listed, to several works but never considered them as granting me author status over them. We aren't specifically talking in exerting any rights but only in claiming them. This was one of the reasons I chose this project to contribute to.
:::::::: An erroneous or intentionally false claim if made is meaningless but actionable upon, a copyright violation.
:::::::: One of the previous discussions we had involving several Wikibookains (but not the general community) was specifically about this type of author pages, claims were made that this format reinforces the license, for instance, I (and at least another Wikibookian) defended that the GFDL requires a clear agreement to it, that is not provided or guaranteed by the submit statement, especially outside of the Wikimedia project, in stand alone form, and recognized the technical limitations of the edit history to provide usable and reliable information. The CC-BY-SA 3.0 is more lax in that, even if it indicates that attributions should be performed as the authors requires, one reason why it was adopted was the removal of the necessity to include a verbose copy of thelicense.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:36, 3 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

;Northern Hemisphere: These stars and constellations can be seen from anywhere north of the tropics in the Northern Hemisphere (they are more difficult to see in the tropics, and the North Star cannot be seen at all from the Southern Hemisphere).  The North Star never appears to move at all, and it can be found due north.  The Big Dipper and Cassiopeia will rotate around the North Star (also known as Polaris, since it is directly above the North Pole).  When drawing the diagram, be sure to include the seven stars in the Big Dipper, the five in Cassiopeia, and the North Star.  Make sure that the two stars at the end of the Big Dipper's &quot;bowl&quot; point to the North Star.  Cassiopeia should be shaped like a somewhat flattened &quot;W&quot;.

The Southern Cross, Scorpio, and Orion are not really located very close to one another.  It would be possible to draw them all on a single diagram, but since Orion is on the other side of the sky from the other two, you'd end up drawing an awful lot of sky.  Therefore, it should be acceptable to draw these three on independent diagrams.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Scope ===
In any language, '''scope''' (the context; what is the background) has a high impact on  a given action or statement validity. The same is true in a programming language.

In a program we may have various constructs, may they be objects, variables or any other such. They come into existence from the point where you declare them (before they are declared they are unknown) and then, at some point, they are destroyed (as we will see there are many reasons to be so) and all are destroyed when your program terminates.

We will see [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables#Scope|that variables have a finite life-time when your program executes]], that the scope of an object or variable is simply that part of a program in which the variable name exists or is visible to the compiler.

==== Global scope ====
The default scope is defined as '''global scope''', this is commonly used to define and use global variables or other global constructs (classes, structure, functions, etc...), this makes them valid and visible to the compiler at all times.

{{NOTE|
It is considered a good practice, if possible and as a way to reduce complexity and name collisions, to use a {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}} scope for hiding the otherwise global elements, without removing their validity.
}}

==== Local scope ====
A '''local scope''' relates to the scope created inside a '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements#Compound statement|compound statement]]'''''. 

{{NOTE|The only exceptional case is the {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} keyword. In that case the variables declared on the  {{C++ Programming/kw|for}} ''initialization'' section will be part of the local scope.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Polyphemus (In Greek: Πολύφημος) was a cyclops portrayed in the Odyssey and the Aeneid.  After capturing [[Greek Mythology/Heroes/Odysseus|Odysseus]] and several of his men, Polyphemus held them capture in a cave, along with the cyclops' sheep and goats.  He sealed the cave shut with a massive stone.  During the ordeal, Polyphemus killed and ate six of the sailors.  On the second day, Odysseus made the cyclops drunk, claiming his name was &quot;Noman&quot;, before five men drove a large sharpened stake into Polyphemus' only eye, blinding him.  The cyclops called for help and other cyclops came to his aid; but when he said Noman had hurt him, the cyclops took it to mean that no man had hurt him, so they left him alone.

The next day, when Polyphemus rolled away the stone to let out his flock, Odysseus and his men clung to the fur of the flocks underbelly.  Checking the animals backs with his hands, Polyphemus did not find the men.

Yet after they have escaped and were on their ship, Odysseus called to the blind cyclops and told him who he really was.  Polyphemus, in rage, hurled a great stone into the sea, nearly sending Odysseus' ship onto land.  They sailed further out and again Odysseus mocked the cyclops.  Yet Odysseus did not know that Polyphemus was the child of [[Greek Mythology/Gods/Poseidon|Poseidon]], who would torment Odysseus' voyage.

In the Aeneid, it tells of [[Greek Mythology/Heroes/Aeneas|Aeneas']] encounter with the cyclops, seeing his wounds:

Polyphemus, lived on berries and roots, walked with a cane.  He went to the sea often to wash out his eye-socket.  One time, he heard the sounds of Aeneas' ships oars as they rowed nearby; but in fear, they hurriedly rowed away.

==What You Need==
* Wiring Harness
** You can pick these up at most electronics stores ([http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_detail.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474396672459&amp;PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524443291220&amp;bmUID=1176078006788&amp;assortment=primary&amp;fromSearch=true Canadian Tire])
* Mounting Harness / Pocket
** You can order these from Mazda (BJ1H-66-9M0) or find them elsewhere ([http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_detail.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474396672459&amp;PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524443291222&amp;bmUID=1176078006773&amp;assortment=primary&amp;fromSearch=true Canadian Tire])

==Notes==
* You should try and wire the ground lead from your new stereo to the chassis if at all possible
* Remember to put the rubber tab on at the back of your new stereo (this helps keep it stable)
* Your car will sound quite different after you are done, even with factory speakers!

==Steps (Single DIN)==
# Connect your wiring harness to your new stereo's wiring harness
#* Don't forget to connect extra wiring from the ground and +battery if you plan on adding any amps
#* My wiring harness was missing pins for 11 and 12, so I going to have to buy an extra pin for 12 and insert it myself, until then I will just do without the illumination functionality.
# [[Mazda Guide/Protege 5/Removing Factory Stereo|Remove the factory stereo]] or remove your old aftermarket stereo
# Slide the stereo sleeve (that metal frame thing that came with your stereo) into the mounting harness, it should be fairly snug
# Now slide your mounting harness into the hole in the dash, this should also be quite snug
#* My mounting harness had small clips around the edges that snapped into place, i had to give it a few shoves for it to snap into place
# Use a flathead screwdriver to depress the tabs on the sleeve to keep the sleeve in place (it shouldn't move around afterwards)
#* Just visually inspect which tabs to depress, whichever ones would most help keep it in place
# Now connect the wires and wiring harness to your stereo, including the auxiliary input wires if you have any
#* remember to thread the aux wires through to somewhere first
#* try and get the bulk of the wiring tucked down behind the pocket
#* connecting the antenna wire last seems to work best
# now slide the new stereo into the sleeve, it will snap once it is in place
#* if it seems like the stereo won't go any further and its sticking out, this is probably because the rubber tab at the back of the stereo is not lined up with the hole in the back, pull the stereo out a little then press on the bottom part only (to lift the bottom up) or the top part only (to push the top down).
# put the trim around your new stereo, turn on the car and try 'er out

==Steps (Double DIN)==
# Connect your wiring harness to your new stereo's wiring harness
# [[Mazda Guide/Protege 5/Removing Factory Stereo|Remove the factory stereo]] or remove your old aftermarket stereo
# Plug in the new stereo and pop it in

=Virtual Compound Libraries=

One of the first steps in [[w:en:In_silico|''in-silico'']] drug design is the determination of the structure of a protein to be targeted, which facilitates the discovery of sites on a given protein that could serve as potential drug targets. These sites can either be active sites, allosteric regulation sites, regions of subunit attachment, or areas known to function in protein-protein or protein-small-molecule interactions.

While protein structures and drug target sites are being determined, the other half of the in silico drug discovery process is carried out. In this phase, chemists create or add to databases of potential drug leads; these virtual drug libraries will then be used for virtual library screening, or [[w:en:virtual_screening|VLS]]. This is the process of docking and scoring potential drugs into predicted target sites. 

==Construction of Virtual Compound Libraries==

In traditional drug discovery, a practice known as target-oriented synthesis (TOS) is used. This approach, brought about by the cost of synthesizing new compounds, focuses on modifying existing chemicals to find a variant that will match a target site. Also due to the cost of synthesizing novel compounds, traditional drug leads have been synthesized based on ease of synthesis, rather than pharmacological value. However, the advent of recent leaps in informational technology advancements have facilitated the construction of virtual compound libraries. By acting as huge repositories of molecular data and their respective characteristics, these libraries allow us to actually carry out a molecular interaction experiment without the actual and sometimes significant expense of wetlab materials. This in silico approach obviously expedites the process as well, ideally geared towards a streamlined process. As virtual drug libraries and virtual library screening are becoming more widespread, there is a shift to diversity-oriented synthesis. It is much cheaper to create many new classes of drugs in silico, as only the ones that dock and score adequately will need to be synthesized. The trade off in terms of cost and time between traditional and contemporary methods cannot be understated. 

Two main categories of drug libraries exist. The first type consists of a general and diverse range of chemical compounds. These types of libraries are used for discovering new types of drug leads for specific applications. Having a diverse range of novel compounds allows new drug leads to be found; in some cases, these leads can end up being more effective inhibitors than ones that are currently used in marketed drugs (Anderson). The other type of library, rather than being “broad” and “shallow,” is “narrow” and “deep.” These libraries are composed of a much narrower range of compounds; however, many different conformation and variations of this narrow range are included. [[Organic_Chemistry/Stereochemistry|Stereochemistry]] is one of the major variables used in creating variations of existing structures to add to such databases. For example, a compound that might not otherwise dock effectively to a protein, might have a tautomer that docks very well. 
The vast majority of the compounds in these libraries are small organic molecules, which have always been the premier substances in traditional drug discovery (Anderson). The reasons for the widespread use of small organic compounds in drug discovery, both in silico and in vitro/in vivo are: such compounds are much easier to fit into protein drug target sites during VLS; they are much easier to synthesize after successful virtual screening, assuming they do not currently exist; they typically have better ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) profiles than many larger, more complex compounds. It is hypothesized that the total drug space exceeds 10^100 compounds, and that figure does not include stereochemical variants (Anderson). So the use of small organic compounds in virtual libraries provides a subset of the total chemical space, albeit a subset that is still almost too large to be completely screened for every targeted protein.

As these data bases grow exponentially in size, they can be expected to become rate limiting factors due to modern computational limitations. For this reason, new approaches are being developed aimed at making the search process itself more effective and efficient. One if these tools, known as shape signatures, can be used in predicting molecular shape similarity or complementarity to a specific ligand or receptor, by analyzing the volume of the ligand and the target active site volume and relating it to such variables as electrostatic factors. A series of [[Probability:Important_Distributions|probability distributions]] are generated, from which geometric principles are applied to provide comparison between drug and target (Meek).

==Virtual Library Screening==

The computational approaches behind the virual screening associated with these Virtual Compound Libraries can be ligand-based, such as is seen with typical pharmacophore queries, or structure based, based on structural similarities between potential lignads, as is exhibited within drug target docking anlyses (Lengauer). Also, quantitative relationships pertaining to structure and activity can also be utilized in developing virtual screening algorithms (Kapetanovic). 

Various computationally intelligent [[algorithms|algorithmic]] methods are employed to add new compounds to virtual libraries, or to generate hit candidates which can be subsequently tested towards hopefully becoming a drug lead candidate. These methods may simply randomly assemble atomic groups into larger structures, or they may adapt existing structures. Often, existing chemicals have parameters such as side groups, chemical modifications, and stereochemistry modified, creating new compounds in the process. Also, incremental construction, pertaining to ligand rigidity and partial structure, as opposed to complete structure, can be employed to optimize these algorithms in computing the potential molecular interactions taking place. In general, the more molecular flexibility is permitted, the greater number of pharmacophores are generated, since a greater amount of molecular interaction is permitted.

Due to the large volume of chemical space contained in even the narrowest of virtual compound libraries, multidimensional methods of applying compounds to targets have started to take hold.  These methods go through a series of 'weeding' techniques based on factors of ever-increasing stringency.  The first step of such a process would apply known limiting factors to the database as a whole.  These factors may include unmanageable molecular size, structures known to induce toxicity, [[w:en:Cytochrome_P450_oxidase|cytochrome P450 ]] activation, or factors known to limit solubility.  Once these initial limitations removed the first set of unsuitable compounds, the second level of screening would be applied.  The second dimension utilizes 'molecular topology', which in simplest form is merely a method to assign functional and behavioral characteristics to a structural element.  This could include solubility, polarity, and ability to form hydrogen bonds.  The selectivity in this step would be based on either comparison with know in vivo ligands or the functionality of the known target site.  The third dimension uses, appropriately enough, three dimensional models of the molecules are used to determine possibility of binding to the rough model of a target site.  In the final, fourth dimension of the screening method, docking and scoring of the molecules left in the library is begun.  This is based on all the factors in the previous dimensions but on a much more sophisticated scale.  The structure of the target site is compared to a potential hit and all possible interactions are manifested mathematically to generate the final list of top scoring products.  This method of virtual screening allows for less analysis time as the least fit molecules do not undergo rigorous screening.  Instead, their obvious deficiencies for the drug target are used to eliminate them from time consuming scoring methods (Bleicher).  

Pharmacophores, which are sets or patterns of chemical groups known to intereact in identical fashion around the same receptor site, are often conserved in deriving new compounds from existing ones, aiding in future predictions of drug to target interactions (Lengauer). Furthermore, compounds that belong to classes of known drug leads, designating the fact that they showed positive signals in in-silico and in-vivo tests, may be put into focused libraries (Bleicher). These databases modify compounds slightly to product many similar, yet slightly different, structures in an effort to expand classes of known pharmacological value. The sheer amount of potential molecular interactions possible, given all possible variables in the biological world, necessitates the use of modern computation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

There are many great people who have worked, and are working within the field of Instructional Technology. These leaders in the field and their work serve to shape our views, influence our practices, and fuel our research. This paper will look at one such person, Ruth Colvin Clark. Ruth Clark’s work thus far has been focused in the following areas: cognitive and evidence-based methods for training and performance improvement, effective use of graphics, multimedia and learning, and e-learning. This paper will look at Clark’s career, her significant contributions to the field of Instructional Technology, and the impact her work could have, and is having on the way Instructional Technology practitioners develop instruction, look at media’s role in education, and design and develop e-learning.


=='''Influential Leader in IT – Ruth Clark'''==

	This is an exciting time for the field of Instructional Technology. Not too long ago, Instructional Technology was just an emerging field of study (Seels &amp; Richey, 1994). Today, Instructional Technology is not only an area of academic study, but a profession. What this means is that, Instructional Technologists are no longer simply focused on producing products as practitioners, but are involved in research as scholars (Seels &amp; Richey, 1994). There have been many countless people who have contributed, and are contributing, to the way instructional designers and the general public view the field of Instructional Technology. One such individual is Ruth Clark. 

===Background and Career===

	Ruth Clark was born in San Francisco, California. Her father was a military man, so the family moved annually. She says that she attended twelve different schools while growing up. (R.C. Clark, personal communication, February 22, 2006) After graduating high school, Clark went on to earn a Bachelors of Arts in Biology and Chemistry, graduating Magna Cum Laude from Immaculate Heart College in 1964. She then went on to earn a Masters of Arts in Biological Chemistry from the Department of Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1966. In 1998, Clark completed her Doctor of Education degree in Instructional Psychology from the School of Education at the University of Southern California. 

	When asked why she chose to pursue a doctoral degree in Educational Psychology, Clark said, “I was a science major for both my undergraduate and masters degrees, and what appealed to me was the research basis of learning wedded with the creative aspects of instructional production” (R.C. Clark, personal communication, February 22, 2006). 

	Since graduating from USC, Clark has worked as a Curriculum Developer, a Training Manager, and an Adjunct Professor. She currently serves as President for Clark Training &amp; Consulting where she provides seminars and consulting services to improve organizational performance. She also strives in her everyday work to translate research in instructional psychology for practitioner application. Clark is also the author and/or co-author of five books and numerous articles. She has also won various awards for her seminars and publications. 

	As far as her role thus far in the field of Instructional Technology, Clark says that, “My goal has been to translate valid empirical research into usable guidelines for practitioners.  I feel my books written with research scientists such as Richard Mayer and John Sweller are contributions that I personally value the most” (R.C. Clark, personal communication, February 22, 2006). Clark’s work has centered on cognitive methods for designing training as well as media’s application in instruction. The two researchers she cited are well-known in these areas. Richard Mayer has served as a Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) since 1975. Mayer’s current research centers on cognition, instruction and technology (Department of Psychology, UCSB, 2003). John Sweller resides at the University of New South Wales, Australia, and has worked since the early 1980s on cognitive load theory (Clark, Nguyen &amp; Sweller, 2006). 
Evidence-Based Instruction and Cognition Load Theory. 

	In her many articles, presentations and books, Clark addresses the issue of Instructional Technology practitioners incorporating more rapidly research and learning psychology into their design, development, and delivery decisions (Clark, 2003). She says, “I hope we will see a greater accumulation and synthesis of research on learning mechanisms and how to harness learning psychology through Instructional Technology.  I believe we will continue to see the impact of globalization on Instructional Technology implementations. I would like to see more precision of our terms and definitions with an emphasis on defining interventions in terms of their psychological mechanisms rather than their surface features” (R.C. Clark, personal communication, February 22, 2006).	

	She cites the separation of research and practitioner communities as the main barrier to evidence-based practice (Clark, 2003). She says, “My hope is that the field is moving more toward evidence-based practice and I have tried to move things in that direction by summarizing the research of the best instructional scientists in my books and seminars” (R.C. Clark, personal communication, February 22, 2006). 

	In her article, “Applying Cognitive Strategies to Instructional Design” (Clark, 2002), she states that in this information era where brains are in higher demand than brawn, training that optimizes organizational performance is more important than ever. She says, “Instructional technology is a design science that must guide the professional production of instruction … we need to allow research rather than fads and folk wisdom to serve as the infrastructure for the professional practice of training and delivery” (Clark, 2002, p. 8).
 
	In the past few years, Instructional Technology has come under fire as being old, obsolete, and ineffective (Gordon &amp; Zemke, 2000). In response to these charges, Clark says, “…the ISD boxes are still relevant and can be profitably populated by new models and techniques drawn from cognitive theories of learning” (Clark, 2002, p. 9). This shift from visible to invisible value in work calls for Instructional Technology to be equally focused on defining and teaching mental processes as observable job procedures (Clark, 2002).

	She goes onto say that with this shift from labor to knowledge, there have also been major shifts within in the psychological sciences. Educational psychologists have moved from behavioral to cognitive models of learning. She says, “The research in instructional psychology over the past 20 years provides a good start to a scientific foundation for design of effective instruction (Clark, 2002, p.9). She adds that Instructional Technology practitioners must incorporate an understanding of how cognitive and memory systems work during the learning process. 

	When instructional technologists design instruction, in order for it to be effective it must support human cognitive processes (Clark, 2002). The works that Clark has produced with John Sweller has focused on the cognitive load theory. This theory, “is a universal set of leaning principles that are proven to result in efficient instructional environments as a consequences of leveraging human cognitive learning processes” (Clark, Nguyen &amp; Sweller, 2006, p.7). 

	Clark says that the challenge for instructional designers is to develop instruction that provides new instruction to learners without overloading their cognitive circuits (Clark &amp; Taylor, 1994). “Once the learner is overloaded, frustration and demoralization inevitably set in. And people can’t learn when they’re frustrated and demoralized. One key to teaching, then, is to avoid overloading the learner’s working memory” (Clark &amp; Taylor, 1994, p. 40). She offers eight strategies to avoid cognitive overload. They are: talk less and turn key learning points into brief reference notes, do less and make learners do more, chunk training appropriately and dispense it over time, design workbook pages and computer-training screens so that they aid memory during practice, design job aids to aid memory and transfer after training, build automaticity, provide “training wheels” for new learners, and detect and remedy while the training process is in session (Clark &amp; Taylor, 1994). 

	Clark’s work in the area of making the research findings about cognitive load readily available to instructional designers and training practitioners has had a huge impact on the field. The Human Performance Technology Primer names Clark as one of the leaders in the field along with such notables as John Keller, Robert Gagne and Robert Mager (HPT Primer). Her books and articles are being widely used in educational and training settings. She has been published many times by the International Society for Performance Improvement, which is one of the premier organizations for performance and instructional technologists. Clark also served as ISPI’s President in 1996. As a result of her making this research available, instructional design practitioners are more cognizant about the effect of cognitive load on their learners, and design their instruction accordingly.  About Clark’s influence, M. David Merrill said, “Few have done more than Ruth Clark to provide instructional practitioners easy access to the findings of scientific educational psychology” (Clark, 2003, cover). 

	As far as her expectations for the impact her works will have on practitioners in the field, Clark says, “I’m hoping that we’re starting to professionalize – meaning people increasingly understand that training is an expensive investment, technology is complex and we need to leverage our work on the basis of scientific evidence” (Materi, 2003, p.7).
Graphics, Media, and E-Learning.

	In her book, coauthored with Chopeta Lyons, “Graphics for E-learning,” Clark looks at ways practitioners can effectively use graphics in e-learning environments to improve learning outcomes.  In answer to the question, does graphics improve learning, Clark says, “It depends. Many studies that compared lessons that used text alone to teach content with lessons that added relevant visuals to the text have shown that the versions with the graphics do improve learning” (Clark, August 2003, p. 2). Clark says there are three factors that influence the effectiveness of visual treatments. They are: instructional goal, learning landscape, and features of the graphics itself (Clark, August 2003).

	Instructional goals must be factored into the decision making process when selecting graphics. Depending on whether the leaning is procedural or problem-based will influence the types of graphics that will best suite desired learning outcomes. 

	The learning landscape will also have an impact on the types of graphics that are most effective. Environmental factors such as prior knowledge of the audience, computer capabilities, bandwidth, budget, and organizational standards must be considered when selecting graphics for use in instruction (Clark, August 2003).

	Clark explains that graphics contain two types of features, surface and functional. She notes that it does not come as a surprise that graphical features themselves can influence learning effectiveness. What is surprising is that it is not the surface features, which are typically associated with graphics that make the difference. Surface features describe the graphic. Is it a line art, or a photograph? But surface features alone do not determine the effectiveness of a graphic. Rather, it is its functionality that determines its impact on learning (Clark, August 2003). 

	She says, “Many of us are not using graphics effectively. We need to think about ‘what is my content, what is my instructional goal, who is my audience, what is the delivery method, and what is the best graphic to use,’” (Materi, 2003, p. 7). 
	Clark has also co-authored a book with Richard E. Mayer entitled, “E-learning and the Science of Instruction.” In it, they define e-learning as, content and instructional methods delivered on a computer with the aim of improving organizational outcomes (Materi, 2003). She adds though that e-learning should not be generalized. There are many types of e-learning, from synchronous to asynchronous, and from merely delivering information to improving performance. She states that e-learning should be designed on four course architectures: receptive, directive, guided discover or exploratory (Materi, 2003). 

	With the increasing growth of e-learning, there has been much debate about its effectiveness and levels of quality. Research now shows that traditional classrooms and virtual classrooms (synchronous e-leaning) are about equally effective overall. It is not the medium that makes the difference; rather it is the way instructional designers utilize the features of media that influences learning (Bernard, 2004). 

	Clark agrees with these findings by saying, “The trick to successful use of delivery medium, electronic or traditional, is to exploit the features of that medium in ways that lead to learning” (Clark, 2005, p. 2). In an effort to aid practitioners in the field design more effective e-learning instructional modules, Clark has developed the DVEP model. 

	The DVEP model stands for Define, Visualize, Engage, and Package (Clark, 2005). The Define stage is the first and in it the designer is articulating the business goals and the knowledge skills needed to achieve them. Then, the designer needs to choose the instructional methods needed to achieve the stated learning objectives. The last step in this initial stage is selecting the delivery media that best deliver the instructional methods identified (Clark, 2005).

	The second stage is Visualize. In this stage, the designer selects and/or designs the various types of visuals that will best promote learning. She states that it is crucial that designers select visuals for learning functions, and not just because they look good (Clark, 2005). She says, “… you should de-emphasize decorative graphics that can distract learners and depress learning in favor of representational visuals that illustrate the job environment, along with explanatory visuals that promote deeper understanding” (Clark, 2005, p. 5). 

	The third stage in the model is Engage. Frequent, meaningful learner interaction with the content is the main route to learning, and the virtual classroom offers many options to engage learners (Clark, 2005). Clark says that in order to keep learners engaged, designers must provide frequent, job-related interactions and use variety in question type (Clark, 2005).

	The final stage in the model is Package. In this stage designers must pay attention to all the elements that precede and follow the virtual classroom event (Clark, 2005). This means helping with technical issues, stating course objectives and assignments, and establishing a social presence during the early stages of the virtual session. She also says that designer should design working aids for handouts. This should be done during the planning phases of design. Once these handouts are created, it is then imperative that exercises are provided that require learners to reference these handouts during the virtual session and later on the job (Clark, 2005).

	As e-learning continues to expand, the need for effective evaluation of its effectiveness grows with it. Clark says, currently there is not much evidence on the best practices for implementing synchronous learning environments. She does say though, that designers can implement what is known about asynchronous learning and human learning processes until more research is forthcoming (Materi, 2003). Explore one of her elearning symposia [http://www.elearningguild.com/pdf/11/eid04_-_1_-_clark.pdf]. In this symposium, Clark presents an &quot;Evdienced Based Guidelines for Effective Instructional Visuals&quot;.


	The impact of Clark’s work in the areas of graphics, media and e-learning is being felt in positive ways by practitioners in the field. Her book with Mayer was the number one best seller according to its publisher, and the International Society for Performance Improvement awarded it with Outstanding Instructional Communication (Materi, 2003). Apart from the awards she’s received for her publications, Clark’s work is also impacting practitioners from all around the world. 

	In her article, “The e-Learning Edge: Leveraging Interactive Technologies in the Design of Engaging, Effective Learning Experiences,” Lisa Galarneau of New Zealand, cites the work of Clark and Mayer to show how the effective use of media can positively impact learning outcomes (Galarneau, 2004). 

	In an article entitled, “A Cognitive Approach to Instructional Design for Multimedia Learning,” Stephen D. Sorden of Northern Arizona University cites the work of Clark and Mayer as it pertains to online learning. Their research states that online learning can only be effective if structure it in a way that efficiently maximizes learning. What has to be emphasized is not how the instruction is delivered, but whether empirically-tested strategies for multimedia instruction are employed that facilitate knowledge construction by the learner (Sorden, 2005).

	Also, Hansjorg von Brevern from the Institute of Information Systems 
University of Bern, Switzerland in his article, “Cognitive and Logical Rationales for E-Learning Objects,” cites the works of Clark as it pertains to media selection and managing cognitive load.

=='''Conclusion'''==

	Ruth Clark’s work over the years has proven to be of vital importance to practitioners in the field of Instructional Technology. She is calling for the field to grow into its professionalism. She says, “We don’t have the professional recognition and the credibility that other professions do and my hope is in the next 20 years we’ll get a lot more of that. I think part of the key is evidence-based practice, to know what the research is and begin to apply it” (Materi, 2003, p. 7). Currently, Clark is working on finishing a book on how to use the new virtual classroom technologies effectively.  This will give her an opportunity to discuss the relationships between media affordances and learning and to emphasize again that what causes learning are instructional strategies - not delivery media. She is also always looking for partnerships with academic practitioners engaged in long-range programs of experimental research on instructional and other performance support methods (R.C. Clark, personal communication, February 22, 2006).

==What You Need==
* 8mm Socket
* 10mm Socket
* Flathead and Philips Screwdrivers
* Oven
* Paint
** This tutorial uses Rustoleum hi temp flat black barbecue paint. make sure you get a high temp paint...you dont want those catching fire! dunno if it gets hot enough, but just to be safe.

==Steps==
ok so to get the headlights off you have to take off the bumper. it's pretty straightforward but there's some tricky parts. unbolt the mudguards on the bottom and the two 10mm bolts attaching it to the undercarriage. then get up under the fender well and unbolt the two 10mm bolts attaching it to the fenders. unscrew the screws along the top of the bumper grill area. now before you try to pull off the bumper make sure you push in the little tabs under the outer part of the headlight, you can push em down with a thin flathead screwdriver. it looks like this close up...&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img1.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
and it's located right here on the headlight&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img2.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
so the bumper should come right off after that. don't worry about taking all the fog light and turn light stuff off, you can just rest the bumper right in front of the car like so....&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img3.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
so after that is off you can start unbolting the headlights. there are three 10mm bolts holding it to the frame. before you pull it off though take off the bumper support brackets from the bumper support beam. otherwise it'll be tough to get the lights out. that thing looks like this...&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img4.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
make sure you unplug all the lights first! then the headlight should come right out!
ok next step, getting the light ready for the ez bake oven. the oven heats the urethane or whatever it is that holds the lens on, and makes it easy to take apart.&lt;br/&gt;
you dont need to take too much off just the rubber thing that goes around the low beam and that thing with the tab that holds the bumper on i mentioned earlier. also take out this little screw...&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img5.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
that screw holds in that side of the lens, so easy to take it off while it's still cool.
ok it's ready!&lt;br/&gt;
get your oven to 200, shouldn't take long. get a cookie sheet and put a small towel on it, and put your headlight on that. then just plop it in the oven for 10 minutes&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img6.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
after the 10 minutes is up pull it out (wear gloves! mecanix or the home depot ones i have, cuz the light will be hot!) now to get the light apart just use some flathead screwdrivers and gently pry it loose from the tabs and apart from the housing. be patient here or you'll put some dents in the housing. so once that's completely off, you just have to unscrew the two screws holding the bezel onto the lens.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
now comes the long part. sanding. i used a foam 150 grit pad to get the majority and then a scotch brite to get those fun little spots that are hard to get to.&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img7.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
so once the lights are all nice and scuffed and smooth, make sure they are clean. then you paint them! i put a few coats. just make sure it's all coated and not to paint too fast or you'll make it run. and let the paint dry a little inbetween coats. then place em in the sun but out of wind for like 30 minutes or so if using the rustoleum&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img8.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
so once they are dry enough to touch, put em back into the lens and screw em back on. then place them back on the bezel and push em as far as they'll go and put them back into the oven at 200degrees for like 5 minutes. take em out and push the lens all the way on. here's me pushing...&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img9.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
make sure it's sealed all the way around like this!&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img10.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
aint that pretty.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
so after that you just put everything back on. dont forget that small screw that holds the edge of the lens on. and make sure you dont have spare parts and then take pictures to show everyone!&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:Mazda Guide-Protege 5-Headlight Blackout-img11.jpg]]&lt;br/&gt;
so all in all it took about a total of 4 hours or so cuz i had food halfway through. but i am very pleased with the results. hope you guys enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== File organization ===
Most operating systems require files to be designated by a name followed by a specific extension. The C++ standard does not impose any specific rules on how files are named or organized.

The specific conventions for the file organizations has both technical reasons and organizational benefits, very similar to the '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Style Conventions|code style conventions]]''''' we will examine later. Most of the conventions governing files derive from historical preferences and practices, that are especially related with lower level languages that preceded C++. This is especially true when we take into consideration that C++ was built over the C89 ANSI standard, with compatibility in mind, this has lead to most practices remaining static, except for the operating systems improved support for files and greater ease of management of file resources.

One of the evolutions when dealing with filenames on the language standard was that the default include files would have no extension. Most implementations still provide the old C style headers that use C's file extension &quot;.h&quot; for the C Standard Library, but C++-specific header filenames that were terminated in the same fashion now have no extension (e.g. iostream.h is now iostream). This change to old C++ headers was simultaneous with the implementation of [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Scope/Namespaces|namespaces]], in particular the std {{C++ Programming/kw|namespace}}.

{{NOTE|Please note that file names and extensions do not include quotes; the quotes were added for clarity in this text.}}

==== File names ====
Selecting a file name shares the same issues to naming variables, functions and in general all things. A name is an identifier that eases not only communication but how things are structured and organized.

Most of the considerations in naming files are commonsensical:
*Names should share the same language: in this, internationalization of the project should be a factor.
*Names should be descriptive, and shared by the related header, the extension will provide the needed distinction.
*Names will be case sensitive, remember to be consistent.

;Do not reuse a standard header file name
As you will see later, the C++ Standard defines a [[C++ Programming/Standard Headers|list of headers]]. The behavior is undefined if a file with the same name as a standard header is placed in the search path for included source files.

===== Extensions =====
The extension serves one purpose: to indicate to the Operating System, the IDE or the compiler what resides within the file. By itself an extension will not serve as a guarantee for the content.

Since the C language sources usually have the extension &quot;.c&quot; and &quot;.h&quot;, in the beginning it was common for C++ source files to share the same extensions or use a distinct variation to clearly indicate the C++ code file. Today this is the practice, most C++ implementation files will use the &quot;.cpp&quot; extension and &quot;.h&quot; for the declaration of header files (the last one is still shared across most assembler and C compilers).

There are other common extensions variations, such as, &quot;.cc&quot;, &quot;.C&quot;, &quot;.cxx&quot;, and &quot;.c++&quot; for &quot;implementation&quot; code. For header files, the same extension variations are used, but the first letter of the extension is usually replaced with an &quot;h&quot; as in, &quot;.hh&quot;, &quot;.H&quot;, &quot;.hxx&quot;, &quot;hpp&quot;, &quot;.h++&quot; etc...

Header files will be discussed with more detail later in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor|Preprocessor Section]] when introducing the #include directive and the standard headers, but in general terms a header file is a special kind of [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code|source code]] file that is included (by the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor|preprocessor]]) by way of the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor#Inclusion of Header Files (#include)|#include]] directive, traditionally used at the beginning of a &quot;.cpp&quot; file.

==== Source code ====
C++ programs would be compilable even if using a single file, but any complex project will benefit from being split into several source files in order to be manageable and permit re-usability of the code. The beginning programmer sees this as an extra complication, where the benefits are obscure, especially since most of the first attempts will probably result in problems. This section will cover not only the benefits and best practices but also explain how a standardized method will avoid and reduce complexity.   

;Why split code into several files?
Simple programs will fit into a single source file or at least two, other than that programs can be split across several files in order to:

*Increase organization and better code structure.
*Promote code reuse, on the same project and across projects.
*Facilitate multiple and often simultaneous edits.
*Improve compilation speed.

;Source file types
Some authors will refer to files with a .cpp extension as &quot;source files&quot; and files with the .h extension as &quot;header files&quot;.  However, both of those qualify as source code. As a convention for this book, all code, whether contained within a .cpp extension (where a programmer would put it), or within a .h extension (for headers), will be called source code. Any time we're talking about a .cpp file, we'll call it an &quot;implementation file&quot;, and any time we're referring to a header file, we'll call it a &quot;declaration file&quot;. You should check the editor/IDE or alter the configuration to a setup that best suits you and others that will read and use this files. 

; Declaration vs Definition
In general terms a declaration specifies for the linker, the identifier, type and other aspects of language elements such as variables and functions. It is used to announce the existence of the element to the compiler which require variables to be declared before use. 

The definition assigns values to an area of memory that was reserved during the declaration phase. For functions, definitions supply the function body. While a variable or function may be declared many times, it is typically defined once.

This is not of much importance for now but is a particular characteristic that impacts how the source code is distributed in files and how it is processed by the compiler subsystems. It is [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type#Definition_vs._declaration|covered in more detail]] after we introduce you to [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Statements/Variables/Type|variable types]].

===== .cpp =====
An implementation file includes the specific details, that is the definitions, for what is done by the program.  While the header file for the light declared what a light could do, the light's .cpp file defines how the light acts.

We will go into much more detail on class definition later; here is a preview:

[[Image:Nuvola mimetypes source cpp.png|right|95px||.cpp files]]
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &quot;light.h&quot;

Light::Light () : on(false) {
}

void Light::toggle() {
  on = (!on);
}

bool Light::isOn() const {
  return on;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===== .h =====
'''Header files''' contain &lt;u&gt;mostly&lt;/u&gt; declarations, to be used in the rest of the program.  The skeleton of a class is usually provided in a header file, while an accompanying implementation file provides the definitions to put the meat on the bones of it.  Header files are not compiled, but rather provided to other parts of the program through the use of &lt;code&gt;#include&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Image:Nuvola mimetypes source h.png|right|95px||.cpp files]]
A typical header file looks like the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Inside sample.h
#ifndef SAMPLE_H
#define SAMPLE_H

// Contents of the header file are placed here.

#endif /* SAMPLE_H */
&lt;/source&gt;

Since header files are included in other files, problems can occur if they are included more than once.  This often results in the use of &quot;header guards&quot; using the '''''[[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/Compiler/Preprocessor|preprocessor directives]]''''' (#ifndef, #define, and #endif).  #ifndef checks to see if SAMPLE_H has appeared already, if it has not, the header becomes included and SAMPLE_H is defined.  If SAMPLE_H was originally defined, then the file has already been included, and is not included again.

[[Image:Nuvola mimetypes source h.png|right|95px||.cpp files]]
Classes are usually declared inside header files.
We will go into much more detail on class declaration later; here is a preview:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
// Inside light.h
#ifndef LIGHT_H
#define LIGHT_H

// A light which may be on or off.
class Light {
  private:
    bool on;

  public:
    Light ();       // Makes a new light.
    void toggle (); // If light is on, turn it off, if off, turn it on
    bool isOn();    // Is the light on?
};

#endif /* LIGHT_H - comment indicating which if this goes with */
&lt;/source&gt;

This header file &quot;light.h&quot; declares that there is going to be a light class, and gives the properties of the light, and the methods provided by it.  Other programmers can now include this file by typing &lt;code&gt;#include &quot;light.h&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in their implementation files, which allows them to use this new class.  Note how these programmers do not include the actual .cpp file that goes with this class that contains the details of how the light actually works.  We'll return to this case study after we discuss implementation files.

==== Object files ====
An object file is a temporary file used by the compiler as an intermediate step between the source code and the final executable file.
All other source files that are not or resulted from source code, the support data needed for the build (creation) of the program. The extensions of these files may vary from system to system, since they depend on the IDE/Compiler and necessities of the program, they may include graphic files, or raw data formats.

=====Object code=====
The compiler produces machine code equivalent (object code) of the source code, contain the ''[[w:Binary and text files|binary]] language'' (''machine language'') instruction to be used by the computer to do as was instructed in the ''source code'', that can then be linked into the final program. This step ensures that the code is valid and will sequence into an executable program. Most object files have the file extension (.o) with the same restrictions explained above for the (.cpp/.h) files.

=====Libraries=====
Libraries are commonly distributed in binary form, using the (.lib) extension and header (.h) that provided the interface for its utilization. Libraries can also be dynamically linked and in that case the extension may depend on the target OS, for instance windows libraries as a rule have the (.dll) extension, this will be covered later on in the book in the [[C++ Programming/Compiler/Linker/Libraries|libraries section]] of this book.

==== Makefiles ====
It is common for source code to come with a specific script file named &quot;Makefile&quot; (without a standard extension or a standard interpreter). This type of script files is not covered by the C++ Standard, even though it is in common use.

In some projects, especially if dealing with a high level of external dependencies or specific configurations, like supporting special hardware, there is need to automate a vast number of incompatible compile sequences. These scripts are intended to alleviate the task. Explaining in detail the myriad of variations and of possible choices a programmer may make in using (or not) such a system goes beyond the scope of this book. You should check the documentation of the IDE, make tool or the information available on the source you are attempting to compile.

By analogy to colon CA, breast lesions may develop in a linear fashion:
*Normal -&gt; Usual ductal hyperplasia -&gt; Atypical ductal hyperplasia -&gt; DCIS -&gt; Invasive CA
*Causal evidence is lacking


*'''Mayo, 2005''' (1967-1991) PMID 16034008 -- &quot;Benign breast disease and the risk of breast cancer.&quot; (Hartmann LC, N Engl J Med. 2005 Jul 21;353(3):229-37.)
**Retrospective. 9087 women with benign breast disease, compared to SEER registry. Median F/U 15 years
**Histology: Nonproliferative 67%, proliferative without atypia 30%, atypical hyperplasia 4%
**Relative risk: overall 1.6; nonproliferative 1.3 (but if also no FH, RR 1.0); proliferative without atypia 1.9, atypical hyperplasia 4.2
**Family history independent risk factor


==Radial Scar==
*Region of central sclerosis, surrounded by epithelial proliferative lesions, cystic changes, and papillomas extending radially from the central sclerosis. If &gt;1.0 cm, can be termed &quot;complex sclerosing lesions&quot;
*On screening mammogram, may be indistinguishable from small invasive CA
*It appears to be pertuberation of normal stroma, but whether it is a precuror lesion is yet to be established
*Associated with invasive/DCIS pathology ~20%, proliferative/ADH pathology ~20%, and benign ~60%
*One study (Nurses Heatlh Study, 1999) found presence of RS to be an independent risk factor for BCA. However, a larger study (Vanderbilt, 2006) found that the risk is largely attributable to co-existent proliferative disease (e.g ADH)
*If there is associated invasive CA, DCIS, or proliferative pathology, it should be managed as such. There is no consensus as yet on how to manage benign solitary radial scar


*'''Ottawa, 2006''' (1995-2003) PMID 16944680 -- &quot;Management of radial scars found at percutaneous breast biopsy.&quot; (Becker L, Can Assoc Radiol J. 2006 Apr;57(2):72-8.)
**Retrospective. 184/227 radial scar biopsies done via 14-gauge (144 biopsies) or 11-gauge bx (40 biopsy). 30 lesions 14-gauge followed by 11-gauge
**Presence of RS: associated with CA 20%, high-risk lesion 20%, benign lesion 60%. 
**Specificity: 4% CA missed (5% for 14-gauge and 0% for 11-gauge), underestimated in 22% (25% and 17%). 
**Conclusion: If benign RS found on 14-gauge, need 11-gauge or surgery. If benign RS found on 11-gauge, mammographic follow up sufficient

*'''Vanderbilt, 2006''' (1950-1986) PMID 16502407 -- &quot;Interdependence of radial scar and proliferative disease with respect to invasive breast carcinoma risk in patients with benign breast biopsies.&quot; (Sanders ME, Cancer. 2006 Apr 1;106(7):1453-61.)
**Retrospective. 9556 women (biopsied) enrolled in Nashville Breast Cohort. RS in 9.2% Most found incidentally. Average F/U 20.4 years
**Risk of IBC: RS 7.0% vs. 5.5% controls (RR 1.8 at 10 years, SS). 92% of women with RS had proliferative disease; but RS only present in 1.3% of bx without proliferative disease. Stratifying for proliferative disease resulted in minimally increased risk
**Conclusion: RS mildly elevates risk of IBC, but largely attributable to co-existent proliferative disease. Further interventions should be based on extent of atypical hyperplasia
  
*'''Newcastle upon Tyne, 2005''' (UK)(1988-2002) PMID 16024215 -- &quot;All radial scars/complex sclerosing lesions seen on breast screening mammograms should be excised.&quot; (Fasih T, Eur J Surg Oncol. 2005 Dec;31(10):1125-8.)
**Retrospective. 124 women from screening program, detected by mammogram, with histologically confirmed RS
**Presence of RS: 66% pure radial scar, 18% ADH, 16% DCIS or invasive CA
**Mammogram: If FNA, mammogram 5/9 malignancy; if localization Bx, mammogram 4/11 malignancy
**Conclusion: All screen-detected stellate lesions should be excised due to association with pre-malignant and malignant disease

*'''Melbourne, 2003''' PMID 12518358 -- &quot;Fourteen-gauge needle core biopsy of mammographically evident radial scars: is excision necessary?&quot; (Cawson JN, Cancer. 2003 Jan 15;97(2):345-51.)
**Prospective. 75 consecutive RS detected by mammogram from population-based screening. 55 patients stereotactic core Bx first, 8 patients US-guided core Bx first, followed by excision bx
**Radial scar: overall 51/62 patients (82%). Sensitivity for stereotactic 85%, for US-guided 63%
**Associated lesions: in 4 patients with DCIS on excision, stereotactic bx revealed ADH or DCIS (both of which require excision). No invasiave CA. ADH present in 57%, found on biopsy in 72%
**Conclusion: Stereotactic core bx proven RS can be managed by mammography, provided there is no associated DCIS, ADH, or LCIS

*'''John Wayne CI, 2002''' PMID 12388495 -- &quot;Percutaneous core needle biopsy of radial scars of the breast: when is excision necessary?&quot; (Brenner RJ, AJR Am J Roentgenol. 2002 Nov;179(5):1179-84.)
**Retrospective. 157 lesions treated with surgery (102) or followed by mammography (55)
**CA risk: if ADH present, CA in 28%; if no atypia, CA in 4%. 
**Sensitivity: Missed in 9% of spring-loaded vs. 0% of vacuum-assisted (SS); missed in 8% if &lt;12 samples vs. 0% if &gt;=12 samples
**Conclusion: RS diagnosis likely reliable if no ADH, bx includes &gt;=12 specimens, and mammography agrees. If not, then need excisional bx

**Case-control. 1396 women from Nurses' Health Study, 255 women with BCA, 1141 controls. Median F/U 12 years
**Radial scar: 99/1396 women (7.1%); mostly incidental finding (median 4.0 mm)
**Cancer risk: Overall RR 1.8; if proliferative disease without atypia, RR 3.0 if RS vs. RR 1.5 if no RS; if proliferative disease with atypia, RR 5.8 if RS vs. RR 3.8 if no RS

== Unconfusing debits and credits ==

Like many people, I find the assignment of debits and credits very confusing.  After thinking hard, I think I have a good way to explain it.  If someone else agrees that this is good, please move it into the main text in a suitable place:

Many people find the ways accountants use &quot;debit&quot; and &quot;credit&quot; very confusing; they seem to be used exactly backward from what makes sense.  Shouldn't an asset be a credit?  Why are assets tracked as debits?  There is actually a simple logic to them, based on a few fundamental rules:
# The accountant never creates or destroys any money.  This is inherent in the double-entry system.  Money is shuffled between accounts, but debits and credits are always in exact balance.
# And so, the entire business never creates or destroys any money.  The final &quot;catch-all&quot; account where profits and losses end up is owner's equity.  Any assets in excess of liabilities are owner's equity.
# The terms &quot;credit&quot; and &quot;debit&quot; are used with the intuitive meaning of &quot;credit is good and debit is bad&quot; ''from the point of view of the owner''.  Profits are recorded as a credit to owner's equity.  This is because accountants are fundamentally reporting to the owners about the state of the business.
# But because credits and debits always balance, the only way to credit an equity account is to debit another account.  So to non-equity accounts, debits are &quot;good&quot; and credits are &quot;bad&quot;.

The point to remember is that from the point of view of the ''accountant'', owner's equity is just another kind of liability.  If the business were to be liquidated tomorrow, all of the debit accounts would be collected (e.g. assets sold), and the credit accounts (creditors) paid.  From the owner's point of view, equity is the &quot;good&quot; kind of credit account and liabilities are the &quot;bad&quot; kind, but as far as the accountant is concerned, they're both creditors to be paid.

So the terminology makes sense from the owner's point of view, but from the point of view of the business, it seems backward because it is backward.

The rest of the confusion is based on people's aversion to negative numbers.  Rather than just declare that credits are positive and debits are negative (or vice-versa), and that all accounts must add up to zero, accounts are divided into &quot;normally credit&quot; accounts and &quot;normally debit&quot; accounts, whose values are both recorded using positive numbers.  This saves writing a lot of minus signs, but you have to know to negate the right accounts before adding them together.

==Two types of ultracentrifuges developed: analytical and preparative==

===Analytical===

·      Uses small sample size (less than 1 ml)

·      Built in optical system to analyze progress of molecules during centrifugation

·      Uses relatively pure sample

·      Used to precisely determine sedimentation coefficient and MW of molecules

·      Beckman Model E is an example of centrifuge used for these purposes.

 

===Preparative===

·      Larger sample size can be used

·      No optical read-out – collect fractions and analyze them after the run

·      Less pure sample can be used

·      Can be used to estimate sedimentation coefficient and MW

·      Generally used to separate organelles and molecules. Most centrifugation work done using preparative ultracentrifuge 

·      Several models available, including L5-65 and L5-75 used for preparative purposes.

==Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry==
&lt;p&gt;
[[Proteomics/Protein Identification - Mass Spectrometry|Mass spectrometry]] (MS) proves to be one of the more sensitive techniques in proteomics which, while making it an incredibly useful technology, leaves it susceptible to strict sample preparation requirements. The conditions of any particular MS experiment will ultimately dictate the degree and types of preparations necessary but some concepts can be applied to any MS experiment, such as enrichment and fractionation. Furthermore, with the current emphasis being put on high-throughput techniques involving MS there is an increasing demand for automated and streamlined sample preparation tools for protein and peptide extraction upstream of MS.
&lt;/p&gt;
====Protein Fractionation, Partitioning &amp; Enrichment====
&lt;p&gt;
The first step to any proteomics experiment, particularly MS, is often to reduce the complexity of the sample; or &lt;b&gt;fractionate&lt;/b&gt; the sample. The goal of fractionation is usually to remove the “highly abundant components of the proteome”&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser&quot;&gt;Glaser, V. (2006) Sample Prep Upstream of Mass Spectrometry: Advances Focus on Sample Clean-Up, Fractionation, and Separation. Genetic Engineering &amp; biotechnology News (Vol. 26, No. 10). Obtained from http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem.aspx?aid=1667&amp;chid=1&lt;/ref&gt; followed by “subsequent fractionation of the moderate to low abundance proteins”&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser&quot;/&gt;  in order to produce a concentrated sample of proteins with the potential to be clinically relevant. There are a number of fractionation protocols and tools available and it is not uncommon to utilize more than one to adequately reduce the convolution of a sample. A protein sample can be fractionated on the basis of size, charge, hydrophobicity, and/or binding affinity. These qualities are often the basis of the many available kits capable of enriching a sample by partitioning out highly abundant proteins from a sample such as serum. Examples of such kits include Beckman Coulter’s ProteomeLab IgY-12 spin and LC column kits which “selectively partition 12 highly abundant proteins found in serum or plasma”&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser&quot;/&gt; or Bio-Rad’s ReadyPrep protein extraction kits which “fractionate protein mixtures based on cellular location (the cytoplasmic/nuclear fraction, membrane proteins, and membrane proteins specifically involved in intracellular signaling).”&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
====Sample Clean-up====
&lt;p&gt;
The clean up of a protein sample is more crucial prior to introduction to the mass spectrometer than in most other proteomics experiments primarily because of the sensitivity of the technology, but also because ‘dirty samples’ can be quite detrimental to the machine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In terms of MS sensitivity, it is “necessary to remove the detergents, [ion suppressing] salts, and chaotropes commonly used in proteomic sample preparation to increase solubility”&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser&quot;/&gt; as they can compromise analysis. In cleaning up samples for MS, one can utilize any number of concepts described in the [[Proteomics/Protein Sample Preparation/Contaminant Elimination|Contaminant Elimination]] section of this chapter. Finally, it should be noted that it is important to maintain an awareness of protein yield while attempting to maximize the quality of data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
====Differential Labeling of Proteins====
&lt;p&gt;

'''Main Focus'''

The results that can be derived from an experiment depends on the way the sample used was prepared. Optimizing the steps in sample preparation to get better results in mass spectrometry can help in the better understanding of host pathogen interactions.

'''Summary'''

[[Image:SPE Manifold.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Solid Phase Extraction Manifold]]



Mass Spectrometry can be used in proteomics to find out about the interactions pathogens have with the host. However in any analysis the results are largely dependent on the characteristics of the sample used. Changing the way the sample was prepared in the experiment can lead to better results. There are a lot of different steps in sample handling that can be optimized to give better results. However Influence diagrams need to be made to determine the changes made to the sample preparation procedures. For example an increase in selectivity leads to a decrease in sensitivity and vice versa.  Biomass losses have to be considered as well. The different steps which can be optimized are:

#Proteins of interest –       The protein of interest should be identified and its possible location found out. The experiment should be designed keeping this in mind.
#Growth conditions –          The growth conditions that are most suitable for the particular host pathogen can be designed
#Sample Preparation –         Sample size used and the way it is prepared can be changed to optimized for each experiment
#Sample Analysis Platforms –  The platform used to analyze the samples should be considered
#Data Analysis –              It is important how the data found out can be analyzed. Since not every bacterium study has been sequenced optimal data analysis plays an important role.

Tweaking the different steps above can lead to better results in finding out the interactions between pathogens and hosts leading to drug discovery.

====Summary====
:[[File:Labeling Chart.jpg|300px|thumb|right|]]&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O stable isotope labeling in the context of mass spectrometry is a technique that is used in many assay protocols. In simplest terms, the stable oxygen isotope &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O is attached to the target protein in an attempt to identify and quantify unknown proteins. Details vary from there depending on the goal of the experiment. The article identifies details of common methods and the categories of the results produced. One group of methods uses the metabolic function of the cell or organism to insert the isotope. Other methods label using chemical or enzymatic incorporation to accomplish the binding of the isotope. 

:While not the most common isotope labeling technique &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O labeling has certain advantages. Results are generated very quickly, the materials needed to run the assay are relatively cheap, and the amount of sample needed is small. This third point is important as it allows using amount-limited samples, such as those obtained through clinical methods, to be used effetely.  

:Global proteomic investigations&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O labeling samples are profiled quantitatively on a proteome wide basis. Problems can occur through variable cleavage causing error in results. However an unbiased coverage of the proteome is a major advantage over 2D-PAGE-based methods.  

:Targeted proteomic investigations&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; techniques using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O labeling to identify proteins in low abundance. Useful in early diction of biomarkers for disease or identifying proteins used in sorting and trafficking in cell organs. 

:Post-translational modifications&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O labeling to identify proteomes used in process regulation. Quantifying the abundance of the proteome before, after and after translation. 

:Compared to other technique&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O labeling has certain advantages making it very useful under the right conditions. Reagents are relatively cheaper than other assay techniques. Assay turn around times is short. This is useful for generating quick results needed in clinical settings. Assays can be conducted with small sample volumes. Using less sample is very important when dealing with limited supply samples.  

:Conclusion, the choice of technique depends on experimental design. While not always the best choice, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O labeling is very efficient at generating certain types of information quickly and inexpensively.

====Relevance to a Traditional Metabolism Course====
:This article was an overview of the diverse application of the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O labeling technique. It sets forth a very through background of the technique and principle. Sections are then presented on major areas where &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O labeling has and continues to be applied. Breaking down the history of the technique, improvements and breakthroughs in major research areas.

* Multiplexed into MPEG-2 stills
* To avoid square pixel, rectangular pixel distortion:
	Create at 720x540, resize to 720x480 (don't bother to crop 6 pixels from 486)
* An exception for Pros: Create at 640x480 and stretch up to 720x540 to accommodate thin lines that stretch horiznontally, but not vertically)

===Compressor Tips:===
Use VRB
Variable Bit Rate 2 pass of higher

===Advanced DVDs:===
* 1. DVD@ccess
* 2. Widescreen 16x9
* 3. Multilanguage discs
* 4. Subtitles

===Issues That Matter:===
* 1. Assets
* 2. Tracks, markers
* 3. Layered Menus
* 4. Overlay Menus
* 5. Slideshows
* 6. Finishing: first play, hybrids, burn/format

&lt;br&gt;
In compound numerals the lower orders of numerals follow the higher. Each numeral is written separately:

{| {{Uzbek table|Numbers|Compound||0|3|}}
|-
| o’n bir
| eleven (11)
|-
| o’n ikki

|-
| bir ming to’qqiz yuz to’qson ikki 
| one thousand nine hundred-ninety-two (1992)
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The Uzbek ordinal numbers are formed by adding the suffix ''-nchi'' (after vowels) or ''inchi'' (after consonants) to cardinal numbers:

{| {{Uzbek table|Numbers|Ordinals||0|3|}}
|-
| birinchi
| first
|-
| ikkinchi
| second
|-

| third
|-
| to’rtinchi

|-

| fifth
|-
| oltinchi

|-

|-

| eighth
|-
| to’qqizinchi
| ninth
|-
| o’ninchi
| tenth
|-
| yigirmanchi
| twentieth
|-
| o’ttizinchi
| thirtieth
|-
| qirqinchi
| fortieth
|-
| ellikinchi
| fiftieth
|-
| oltmishinchi
| sixtieth
|-
| etmishinchi
| seventieth
|-
| saksoninchi
| eightieth
|-
| to’qsoninchi
| ninetieth
|-
| yuzinchi
| hundredth
|-
| minginchi
| thousandth
|}&lt;br&gt;
In Uzbek the denominator of a fraction always takes the ablative suffix while the numerator does not take any suffix:

{| {{Uzbek table|Numbers|Fractions||0|3|}}
|-
| ikkidan bir
| one half
|-
| to’rtdan uch
| three-fourths
|-
| beshdan to’rt
| four fifths
|-
| o’ndan to’qqiz
| nine tenths
|-
|}
&lt;br&gt;
The decimals are expressed by the word ''butun'' (whole) followed by the denominator and the numerator:

{| {{Uzbek table|Numbers|Decimals||0|3|}}
|-
| o’ttiz sakkiz butun o’ndan olti
| thirty eight and six tenths (36.6)
|-
| bir butun o’ndan to’qqiz
| one and nine tenths (1.9)
|-
| ikki butun o’ndan besh
| two and five tenths (2.5)
|-
|}&lt;Br&gt;
In spoken Uzbek the word butun frequently is omitted or replaced by ''-u'' or ''va'', both meaning 'and':

{| {{Uzbek table|Numbers|Decimals (oral)||0|3|}}
|-
| o’ttiz sakkiz-u o’ndan olti
| thirty eight and six tenths (36.6)
|-
| o’ttiz sakkiz va o’ndan olti
| thirty eight and six tenths (36.6)
|-
| o’ttiz sakkiz o’ndan olti
| thirty eight and six tenths (36.6)
|-
|}

'''''Clematis''''' is a genus of perennial plants, most of which are vigorous, semiwoody climbing vines, but others are herbaceous perennials or shrubs. They are found throughout the temperate regions of both hemispheres, and also in mountains in the tropics. Most of the cool temperate species are deciduous, while many of the warmer climate species are evergreen.

Most species are known as '''Clematis''' in English, while some are also known as '''traveller's joy''', '''leather flower''', '''vase vine''' and '''virgin's bower''', the last three being names used for North American species.

One recent classification recognised 297 species of clematis and modern taxonomists subdivide the genus.  Magnus Johnson divided ''Clematis'' into 19 sections, several with subsections &lt;ref&gt;http://personal.inet.fi/koti/lofgren/Clemnet/Link_sections.htm#MJo&lt;/ref&gt;; Christopher Grey-Wilson divided the genus into 9 subgenera, several with sections and subsections within them &lt;ref&gt;http://personal.inet.fi/koti/lofgren/Clemnet/Link_sections.htm#Gr-W&lt;/ref&gt;.  Several of the subdivisions are fairly consistent between different classifications, for example all Grey-Wilson's subgenera are used as sections by Johnson.

Subgenera of Clematis according to Grey-Wilson:
:''Clematis, Cheiropsis, Flammula, Archiclematis, Campanella, Atragene, Tubulosae, Pseudanemone, Viorna'' 
Some of these were previously classed as separate genera.

==Description==
Clematis have opposite (or in rare cases alternate), pinnately compound leaves, with the petioles often twining to support the plant. Flowers are borne solitary or in panicles, bell-shaped or flattened. Bisexual or sometimes unisexual, stamens many, carpels numerous. Sepals in 4s or 5s, petal-like, petals lacking. Stamens are petaloid in some species. Fruits are achenes, often with long, feathery styles. Stems contain an acrid sap, and the bark of wody species exfoliates in long strips.

==Growing conditions==
Deep, organic-rich soils. Most species need their root zones shaded during the growing season. Full sun to part shade.

==Varieties==
&lt;!--general discussion or bulleted list--&gt;

==Uses==
&lt;!--Ornamental uses, food crop, material use (lumber, cut flower), etc.--&gt;

==Maintenance==
Young shoots are very delicate in the spring and brittle afterwards, so trellis structures should be installed during winter.

==Propagation==
Stratified seed, layering, division, cuttings, or in rare cases grafting

==Harvesting==
&lt;!--Discuss harvesting and storage--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Expressions are comparisons of two things. An example of an expression would be (8 &gt; 6)

==Types of Expressions==
Expressions can be real number like 6 or 7, 'hexadecimal numbers', strings or more complicated expressions. By default all text is considered a [[Game Maker Programming/Variables|Variables]] though if the text was in single or double quotes it would be a string. Any number in an expression is considered a real number unless it has a $ sign in front of it. If it had a $ in front of it then it is a 'hexadecimal number'
==Operators==
An operator is a symbol used for the comparison of two things in an expression. in (8 &gt; 6) the &gt; sign is the operator. There are many different types of operators. For expressions, the following binary operators exist:

* &amp;&amp;  means &quot;and&quot;. For example &quot;if(pi=3.14 &amp;&amp; 3+4=7)&quot;
* ||  means &quot;or&quot;. For example &quot;if(x=0 || y=0)&quot;
* ^^  means &quot;xor&quot;.  example &quot;if(x=32 ^^ y=27)&quot;
* &lt;   means &quot;less than&quot;.
* &gt;   means &quot;greater than&quot;.
* &lt;=  means &quot;less than or equal to&quot;.
* &gt;=  means &quot;greater than or equal to&quot;.
* ! means &quot;Not&quot;. For example &quot;if !(Variable=5)&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

It would certainly help if we know what is a paradigm in the context of Instructional Technology.  Then, we might be able to explain and discuss paradigm shift.

Davis (1978) defines paradigm as &quot;a more concrete conceptualisation of an underlying idea or theory, involving definitions, statements and interrelationships between the statements&quot; (p.23).  In the context of instructional technology (educational technology, he views that the activity of a group of people working together sharing common values and concepts would likely be a shared paradigm. In time this paradigm or series of paradigms will be presented and/or proposed. He notes that &quot;once a paradigm or series of paradigms has been proposed, there will still be details and ambiguities to be identified and resolved&quot; (p.23). In this case, variations of a proposed paradigm will be formed.  Lastly, Davis (1978) critically states &quot;the paradigms that are currently available are worryingly limited, although the variations offered seem endlessly lacking in anything creatively different&quot; (p. 23).

As commonly known, audio-visual education, behavioral psychology, and systems theory are the foundations of the field of IT. The trend being identified here could add the fourth foundation, philosophical. Visscher-Voerman and Gustafson (2004) stated that analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate (ADDIE) activities cannot be observed consistently in application of design processes. Hence, designers can show different frequencies and sequences during the progress of the phases. The transitions and overlaps between the stages produced diversity, too. That is why the different models have been revealed. As a result of these data, they recommended a conceptual framework including of four paradigms for design: 

#Instrumental paradigm: planning-by-objectives 
#Communicative paradigm: communication to reach consensus. 
#Pragmatic paradigm: interactive and repeated try-out and revision. 
#Artistic paradigm: creation of products based on connoisseurship (p. 76).

== Philosophical Roots ==

Visscher-Voerman and Gustafson (2004) proposed each paradigm with their philosophical movements, (a) modernism, (b) critical theory, (c) pragmatism, and (d) post modernism. They are consistent source for different stances and rationalities.

Instrumental paradigm relies on the idea of modernism. In modernism, the end (the solution to problem) is defined separately from and prior to the means (the way to solve the problem). The rationality of modernism is ends-means reasoning. General emphasis of this philosophy is logical reasoning and decomposition of problem into smaller problems to solve. That is why instrumental paradigm concerns with objectives that were expressed as a part of system or programming (Januszewski, 2001).

Communicative paradigm asserts that design process is realized on the basis of communication and negotiation perceptions and opinions to solve a problem. The parading is stemmed from critical theory. According to critical theory, means and ends cannot be perceived independently. Communicative rationality, the current representative of critical theory, aims at reaching consensus.          
Pragmatic paradigm proposes that design is a process of quick building, testing, and revising several prototypes or early product versions. This paradigm relies on pragmatism and pragmatic rationality. It offers that human kind must focus on practical solutions rather than theoretical issues. If something works well and is perceived as useful, this meant that true statement. 

According to artistic paradigm, the unique expertise and experience are the critical players of the design process. This paradigm advocates that design processes cannot be planned and are made in direct reactions to the specific situations where the designer involved. Artistic paradigm is associated with postmodernism. Postmodernism seeks for ultimate theory and the one-only-truth. However, sciences reduce the reality of one view to one foundation. Deconstruction is a strategy which postmodernism uses. In that strategy, current literature and existing meaning are criticized and denied. Postmodernism tries to close gap between the science and the arts. That is why the rational of it is called artistic.

== Trend Effect on Instructional Design ==

These four paradigm views were developed to: (a) emphasize and highlight the different applications of design processes in order of ADDIE activities, (b) help designers understand differences between design approaches and their activities, and (c) facilitate designers’ own design work processes and own design styles, and (d) support values and limitations of each paradigm that are useful form one situation to another (Visscher-Voerman &amp; Gustafson, 2004). 

Kozma (1994) stated that traditional instructional design models do not address the complex interrelationships among media, method, and situations. Most of them were derived from behavioral models. For this reason, they cannot be useful in constructivist environment, social models of learning (Winn, 1989, as cited on Kozma). These four paradigms could be identified as a potential impact trend because after that framework, the model concept of the IT could be rethought. Hence, the framework supports designers with all possible philosophically rooted rationales including necessary techniques and tools. Even though there are too many models in the IT field, especially for design processes, most of them are from the same perspective. In fact, the models seem different but their point of view for analyzing the problem is the same. In contrast to these models, this framework provides different angles to analyze the problem. For this reason, it could be named as the fourth foundation of the IT field. 

Visscher-Voerman and Gustafson (2004) suggested that additional field based research should be implemented to analyze the benefits of design practices for both theorists and practitioner. Because of this point, the framework also provides a concrete relation between theory and practice components of the IT field. The relation can be determined more empirically than ever. This suggestion is going to lead the major dissertation titles in future.

==Purification==
=== Heat Treatment ===

==Suitable Solvents==
;DI Water:not very well suited to make nanotube solutions. Can however be a good choice when used with [[#Dispersing Agents|detergents]]
As CNTs are hydrophobic they are best dissolved in organic solvents such as DMF.

==Dispersion Methods==

==Dispersing Agents==

= Making Nanotube Samples=

== Preparations ==

=== The Substrate ===
==== Choosing the right substrate ====
==== Preparing chips from a wafer ====
''Important: Open wafer boxes &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; inside an operating flowbox!''
*Spin a layer of protective resist on the entire wafer and bake it thoroughly.
*Use a ruler and a diamond pen to scribe the wafer. Make a clean scratch 4 to 5 mm long, parallel to the edge. Cover the wafer with cleanroom paper and break the wafer over an edge.
*Keeping the strip, store the rest of the wafer securely for future use.
*Scribe the resulting strip in rectangular pieces.
*Tear off a strip of clear adhesive tape a little longer than the substrate. Glue it to the resist side. Break the substrate by pulling it over an edge holding the ends of the tape.
*Carefully remove the wafer pieces from the tape with a tweezer.
*Wash the chips in IPA (&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; in acetone, which would remove the protective resist layer).

==== Preparing alignment marks on the surface ====
*Remove protective resist layer with Acetone and wash the chip in IPA
*Spin on your preferred resist system and bake the wafer
*EBL pattern the chips with a 3x3 matrix of alignment marks
**
*Evaporate a sufficiently thick (&gt;35 nm) Cr/Au or Ti/Au metal layer

=== Applying Nanotubes ===

''This section covers methods for random deposition of tubes. Instructions on dielectrophoretic trapping can be found in [[#Dielectrophoresis|this chapter]].''
==== Tubes in Volatile Solvents ====
==== Tubes in SDS (aq.) Solution ====
The tubes are encapsulated in SDS micells and form a stable solution. Thus there is no need for sonication before applying.
* The substrate chip is placed on the hotplate (level 1-2; approx 100 deg C)
* One drop of nanotube solution is applied and left to dry in. This procedure is repeated two more times or until a uniform staining of the chip is visible
* The chip is put into a beaker with water. The beaker is put on the hotplate and heated until the water starts to boil
* The chip is flushed in Popanol and blown dry with nitrogen
This procedure should result in an acceptably even distribution of single tubes on the chip. If there are to many regions of aggregated tubes visible in the SEM repeat the cooking step.
====Prepatterning====
==== Spraying ====

== Cleaning the Substrate ==
=== Plasma Cleaning ===
=== Wet Cleaning === 
An effective method for removing nanotubes from a wafer without destroying other structures is to use surfactants. Here a simple recipe with SDS:
#Sonicate samples in 1 to 10 % SDS (aq.) solution for about 5 min
#Rinse with DI water
#Rinse in IPA
#Blow dry with Nitrogen
Very fragile samples can be cooked in the SDS solution instead of sonication.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have started writing a cookbook for carbon nanotubes some time ago when I realized that I have to explain certain routine things over and over again to new students. There are lots of great textbooks about nanotechnology out there (including the excellent Wikibook on this topic) but there is not really a comprehensive resource for the &quot;simple&quot; things.

I will put the small collection of material I got so far up to form a nucleation point. Hopefully a comprehensive hands on carbon nanotubes manual will form around it.</text>

'''Garlic powder''' is dehydrated garlic cloves that have been ground to a white-yellow powder. It provides some of the flavour, but not the texture, of fresh garlic, lasts for a long period of time and disperses well in liquid, hence the usage in marinades. High quality brands consist of pure garlic, while low quality brands may add artificial colour and flavour enhancers.

Garlic powder is often included in dried spice blends, where the most common is garlic salt.

Garlic is believed to be a natural alternative to pesticide and to protect against fleas, and garlic powder is added to pet food with this purpose. 

1 clove of fresh garlic can be substituted by 1/5 - 1/8 teaspoon of garlic powder.</text>

[[Image:Bixa orellana seeds.jpg|right|thumb|Annatto seeds]]
'''Annatto''', also ''onoto'', ''achiote'', is a spice made of the red pulp surrounding the seeds of the achiote tree in [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]].

Annatto is commonly used as a food colouring agent, and has the food additive number E160b. It gives cheeses such as [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|Cheddar]] and [[Cookbook:Red Leicester Cheese|Red Leicester]] their colour, and helps [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] and [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]] appear the colour that customers expect it to be.

The traditional [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Venezuela|Venezuelan]] dishes [[Cookbook:Hallaca|hallaca]] and [[Cookbook:Perico|perico]] use annatto in their preparation.

==New Classifications==
:''For additional information, see [[Radiation Oncology/Breast/Breast_overview#Tissue_microarray_.28TMA.29_profiling |Tissue microarrays]] ([[Radiation Oncology/Breast/Breast_overview|Breast/Breast overview]])
Gene expression profiling is the basis for additional classification schemes.
*Luminal A type - ER+ and/or PR+, HER2–. Usually low grade. These express genes similar to normal cells lining breast ducts and glands
*Luminal B type - ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+. These are similar to luminal A, but grow faster and have a slightly poorer prognosis.
*Basal type - ER–, PR–, HER2–, cytokeratin 5/6 positive, and/or HER1+. Also known as &quot;triple negative&quot;.  Higher prevalence in young African American women.
*HER2 type - ER-, PR-, HER2+. Usually high histological grade.</text>

      <comment>/* How can you keep your eyes healthy? (Health) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is an eye?==
The eye is a very perplexing system that allows us to view things. Here you will find a lot about the eye. But remember, this is not a professional site. So this is just an outline.

==What is the function of the eyes? (Function)==
Eyes are the parts of our body that perceive light. They allow us to see the world and to understand how objects relate to each other. We can distinguish far objects from close ones and determine their color and shape. The eye acts like a camera where the eye-lens is a replacement of camera-lens, eye-lid of shutter and retina of photographic film.

==What do eyes look like? (Appearance)==
[[Image:Menschliches_Auge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A close up of a human eye.]]
The eye is almost spherical in shape. The eye-ball is about of 2.3cm diameter. We perceive eyes together with eyelids and eyebrows which make up one main characteristic of the face.

==What are the parts of the eyes? (Parts)==
Eyes are made of several different parts. The white part of the eye is called the '''sclera'''.(It is interesting to note that only in Human Species among all other creatures that sclera is visible when the eyes are open). This part covers the surface of the eyes except at the very front. At the front of an eye is a '''cornea'''. This part acts like a shield for the eye. It can still let light pass through because it is transparent. Under the cornea is the '''iris''' and '''pupil'''. The pupil is the black circle in the middle. It is actually a hole that lets light pass through into the back of the eye. The iris is a coloured diaphragm around the pupil. It is a muscle that opens and closes around the pupil to let more or less light through. Behind the pupil is a '''lens''' that focuses the light that passes through it onto the '''retina'''. It is made up of jelly-like crystalline substances and is convex in nature. Between the lens and cornea is a fluid called aqueous humour.Similarly, inside the major part of eye ball is vitreous humour.

The retina is the lining of the inside back of the eye. It is the part of the eye that translates the information from the light into the language of the '''brain''' i.e. electric impulses. The retina is lined with thousands of tiny '''rods''' and '''cones''' which detect the color and amount of light shining onto them. 

The optical information gathered by the rods and cones is passed via the '''optic nerve''' at the back of the eye to the brain.
[[Image:Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye_en.svg|left|thumb|300px|A diagram of the parts of the eye.]]

Most of the reflection takes place through cornea, aqueous humour and vitreous humour and the lens merely function to focus the image on retina. The lens is held by ciliary muscles which also controls the curvature of lens to accommodate it to see distant and close objects clearly.

==How do the eyes interact with other parts of the body? (Interaction with other Body Parts)==
The brain processes the raw data from the eyes to make sense of what you see compared to your knowledge of the world around you. The brain interprets what it receives from the eyes. You do not directly &quot;see&quot;. 

A clear example of this can be seen from experiments where subjects wear glasses that invert the view (turn it upside down). After a while the brain will adjust and turn the scene back up the right way because that agrees with other more reliable information you are receiving. 

Similarly the brain adjusts changes in color and light levels to better match how the objects should appear. 

It also combines the two slightly different views from your left and right eyes to work out the distance of objects from you. Your right eye will show a little more of an object's right side and the left eye will show more of an objects' left side. This is called '''stereoscopic vision'''. This vision helps us to judge the distance accurately and provides us a 3D vision of the world. The difference between the views from each eye becomes less the further the object is away from you.

Our perceptions are not perfect and can lead to misinterpretations of what we see. These are called '''optical illusions'''. 

However even though the brain's processing can be inaccurate, at most times we perceive a faithful reconstruction of the real world. Only optical illusions remind us that there is at times a difference between perception and the true state of affairs. Without our eyes and the complex processing of visual information by our brains we would not be able to make sense of writing, art or photos, nor understand as much as we do from limited visual information.

==What organ systems are the eyes connected with? (Connections)==
[[Image:Lateral_orbit_anatomy_2.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration shows how the muscles and nerves attach to the eye.]]

The optic nerve connects the eyes with the brain. Several eye muscles (4 rectus and 2 oblique muscles) attach the eyes to the skull and perform eye movements to control our gaze and visual focus and the power of accommodation of our eyes.

==How can you keep your eyes healthy? (Health)==

You should avoid putting your hands or any other object in the eyes. Wearing safety goggles when doing construction work can protect your eyes from injury. You should not watch television or use a computer for long periods of time. You should keep books at a distance of about 25cm while reading. Avoid looking at bright objects (like the sun) for too long as it can damage your eyes and even make you blind.

[[File:Petcock.jpg|right|thumb|250px|CB700/750SC Petcock. At the top is the brass fuel tube with the intank filter removed and used to draw fuel in the &quot;ON&quot; position. , Left side is the fuel supply to carb assembly, far right is vac hose to carb, at bottom is the fuel cup ]]

The Petcock (fuel valve) seems to be an on going issue. This device serves a number of functions which may cause confusion when troubleshooting. They are:

1) Manual fuel '''ON''' valve setting for normal operation 

2) Manual fuel '''RESERVE''' valve setting for reserve operation 

3) Manual fuel '''OFF''' valve setting 

4) Automatic fuel shutoff valve which overrides the manual settings. This valve is operated by engine vacuum via the small rubber hose. The valve opens when the engine is started and closes when the engine is stopped.

5) Primary and secondary fuel filtration. One protrudes into the tank, the other is in the small fuel cup at the bottom of the unit.

Before proceeding, make sure there is a '''fire extinguisher''' handy

If the bike has been recently running, turn the petcock to '''OFF''' and unscrew the small fuel cup cover on the petcock. Inspect and clean the small circular fuel strainer. Reinstall strainer and cup.

To determine if the petcock is working properly, turn the petcock to the '''OFF''' position. 
Disconnect the fuel line from the petcock and the smaller vacuum line from the carburetor. While holding an empty can under the petcock, turn the valve to the '''ON''' position. There should be no gas flow. Suck on the vacuum line or use a hand vacuum pump. Gas should start to flow into the can. Release the vacuum on the line and gas should stop flowing.The above test should also work when the petcock is in the '''RESERVE''' position.

If there is no gas flow . Turn the petcock to the '''OFF''' position and 
Ref 4-16 remove the gas tank 
The manual suggests servicing the petcock while still attached to the tank. It is better to remove the petcock completely and check the filters and the fuel valve diaphragm. If the tank is full, drain out most of the gas through the fill hole. 
Ref 4-17 in the manual(bottom of page) loosen the petcock lock nut and remove petcock. There should be a tube like fuel strainer attached. If not, check the tank for the strainer and remove it. Remove the O ring. Drain the remaining gas from the tank.
Ref 4-16 (bottom of page) carefully remove the cover, spring, and both diaphragms. If the bike has sat for a while, chances are that the diaphragms are stuck in the closed position from gas residue. Exercise care in freeing them. Remove the fuel cup, and the small circular strainer.

Set the petcock valve to '''ON''' and inspect the tall fuel tube which sticks up into the tank for gum and varnish residue. Clean with carb cleaner and blow out with compressed air. 
Set the petcock valve to '''RESERVE''' inspect the opening at the base of the tall fuel tube and clean as above. During use, recommend using the '''RESERVE''' setting occasionally to prevent the buildup of gum in the passage. 

Part of the petcock is assembled with rivets. Some internal components may be rubber and could be affected by prolonged soaking with carb cleaner.

Do not use carb cleaner on the rubber diaphragms. Inspect for tears and wear, Replace if required.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The gurus at Adobe have been making a lot of changes for their latest Photoshop release. Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia is sure to give them even more of the market share. One of the more recent additions to the Adobe suite is Adobe Lightroom. Lightroom was released a few weeks ago, and is great for photography pros. Lightroom offers features that are found in Photoshop, but focuses on the features that a photographer uses most commonly. The power of Lightroom is in its ability to &quot;import, select, develop, and showcase large volumes of digital images&quot;. Lightroom is a great Photoshop alternative for those not needing all the features Photoshop offers, has a reasonable price tag of around $200.
The biggest news in the Adobe world is the release of the CS3 suite. Photoshop is the industry standard in photo editing and manipulation, with Corel coming in as a distant second. New with the release of Photoshop CS3 there are two distinct versions. Adobe now offers the standard and extended version. According to Amazon.ca the price of Photoshop CS3 (for Mac) is 772.94 US dollars, whereas CS2 is available now for $599.95. The added features of the extended version sound amazing. From the Adobe website: CS3 offers &quot;3D and motion support with the ability to edit 3D content and incorporate it into 2D compositions, paint and clone over multiple video frames, and more. Comprehensive image analysis with new image measurement and counting tools&quot;.  Photoshop CS3 adds the extra edge for professionals in the medical, film, scientific, and engineering fields.
For more info on the release specs see [[http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/ps_psext_info.html]]Adobe Photoshop CS3

      <text xml:space="preserve">Proverbs 3:5,6 NKJV - 
&quot;Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.&quot;


A Biblical Foundation –


Many important questions need to be answered by Christians who are involved in producing interactive media.  Fundamentally, this is because our commitment to Christ has inherent bearing on what our lives produce.  


For example, one important question is, &quot;How do we love God and love people through interactive media?&quot;  Also, &quot;How does what we produce glorify God and appropriately affect and steward those people whom our products will touch?&quot;  

Many scriptures can be referenced to answer these, and many other, questions.  Paul admonishes believers, in 2 Timothy 2:15 (NKJV), to “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” 

To be a responsible producer of interactive media, it is imperative that Christians search out what the Word of God has to say about the manifold facets of our craft.  By the Word we can learn not only what such responsibility involves practically, but we can also discover what God’s intentions are for this domain of human creativity.  

Such research will protect us from otherwise defaulting into a &quot;worldly&quot; approach to a very important arena.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Canne défense is a new part of Canne de Combat. There is stick defense in the French martial arts, but it's now joined with savate défense, so, it's name is &quot;savate et bâton défense&quot;.

The goal of canne défense is to give ability of canne de combat players to defend themselves on the street using the stick used in canne. The assumption is that a canne player walks from the training to home, and he gets insulted by one or more not-so-gentle means. His first reaction should be evade the situation, but sometimes to evade, or to run away is not an option (somebody to defend, no place to run, etc.) In this situation he uses what he has with, and it is the canne stick. 

There are lot's of techniques described in different books and videos, but, we have to be sceptical with them: they are perhaps not tested under stress, too complicated to use them in a fight situation, or are simply based on the cooperation of the partner. 

So, we have to use our common sense to decide, if a technique in a specific situation is worth, we have to setup different scenarios, try the techniques in controlled fights (with resisting people and using protective equipments), and only if the proved to working, should we say: ok, this technique is good.

== Canne into the hand ==

So, we see, that here will be some trouble. Most of us carry a pack of sticks (5-6 different stick, perhaps a bâton) tied together, and packed into a bag. How can we access our weapon, how can we be sure, that the others won't be able to use our weapons against us (this can be happen, when we simply drop the other sticks). 

I would like to ask everybody, to post his comments/ideas about it.

My idea is to tie the bag with a quick tie method, so, using only one movement, the sticks will be free, and ready to use.

== This came from an inaccurate source and needs a total rewrite ==

After reading this recipe, I checked the reference to ''The Household Cyclopedia of General Information'' and discovered that it was published in 1881 and seems have been put up on the internet as a curiousity. This recipe comes from a section of the ''Household Cyclopedia'' called &quot;Early American recipes: Soups&quot; and this recipe is verbatim from that source.

There are a lot of good asparagus soup recipes available. This one needs to be replaced. --[[User:Unacuoca|Unacuoca]] ([[User talk:Unacuoca|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Unacuoca|contribs]]) 03:06, 22 July 2013 (UTC)

== Member vs. global ==
Why is this a member function:
 ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (int&amp; val );
But is this a global function: 
 ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt; (ostream&amp; out, char c );
Why? [[User:82.139.85.56|82.139.85.56]] 06:48, 19 September 2007 (UTC)

::I don't completely understand what you are asking. Do you understand classes and the use of friend on the example source ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:26, 19 September 2007 (UTC)
I do understand basic C++ classes, templates, etc. I was wondering why &lt;&lt; is a member for int while it is a global function for char. Do you understand what I'm asking now? [[User:82.139.85.236|82.139.85.236]] 14:56, 20 September 2007 (UTC)
----
I think I do...
I've not examined the standard definition but logic dictates that if the global operator&lt;&lt; can been overloaded the scope and how the overloading is performed can and should be optimized.
You should not add friends to existing classes unless you are responsible for their maintenance. You must also keep in mind that std::ostream is at the core a typedef alias, and remember that at least one operand of any overloaded operator must be of some user-defined type. This is why operator&lt;&lt; and operator&gt;&gt; are almost always implemented as non-member functions, exception if any are due to optimization or added functionality.
As an example of this logic I call your attention to:

  // Input and output
  ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; os, const string&amp; s);
  istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(istream&amp; is, string&amp; s);
  istream&amp; getline(istream&amp; is, string&amp; s, char delimiter = '\n');

This String-related global operators and functions are defined in the &lt;string&gt; header.
As you can see this is done so mostly for &quot;logistic&quot;/organizational reasons that any particular optimization (besides that member can access inside a particular scope)... At least this is what I think about the subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:05, 20 September 2007 (UTC)

== Number rounding example ==

This &quot;short&quot; example takes up half the page and, as far as I can tell, doesn't logically follow from the preceding text. I propose it be moved to a more suitable page (by a editor more experienced than I).

{{Wikipedia|Out-of-order execution}}

In a superscalar or similar processor design, there are multiple execution units that can be used to process pieces of data simultaneously. However, these execution units are not always used at the same time, and some processing power is lost. Sometimes, it is possible to feed instructions to all the execution units if we take the instructions out of their original order. '''Out of order execution''' (OOOE) is when a processor is capable of executing instructions out of their original order, in an attempt to do more work in parallel, and execute programs more quickly.

== Hazards ==

OOOE comes with some significant hazards, and the hazard detection units in these processors are not trivial. The dependencies of all instructions need to be determined, and instructions cannot execute before or at the same time as instructions on which they are dependent.

== Example: Intel Hyperthreading ==

{{wikipedia|Hyper-threading}}

'''Hyperthreading''' is the name for a technology developed by Intel for use in the Pentium 4 chip. Hyperthreading works by duplicating some architectural components of the processor, such as the status flags, the control registers, and the general purpose registers. Hyperthreading does not, however, duplicate any of the execution units. 

In a hyperthreaded system, it appears to the operating system that there are two separate processors, when there is only one processor. The OOOE engine feeds instructions from the two separate execution threads to the execution cores, to try and keep all of the cores simultaneously busy. In general hyperthreading increases performance, although in some instances this additional complexity actually decreased performance.</text>

      <comment>&quot;The primary problem&quot;, with reference.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

In addition to power and performance, another useful metric for examining processors is in terms of the amount of power used. Power is a valuable commodity, especially in mobile or embedded environments, and in server farms. Processors that utilize less power are more highly prized in these areas than processors with more capability and better performance.

The primary problem in server farms like the ones used by Google is power.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing the amount of energy used, without reducing the performance of the computer system, is one of the Grand Challenges in computer science.&lt;ref name=&quot;irwin&quot; &gt;

== Gene's Law ==

Less well known then Moore's law is Gene's Law, named after Gene Frantz. According to Gene's law, the power dissipation in embedded DSP processors will decrease by half every 18 months.


== Two reasons to reduce power ==

The power used by a microprocessor causes 2 problems.
Some techniques reduce only peak power; some other techniques reduce only average power.

==== The peak power problem ====

* All the power used by a microprocessor is eventually converted to heat energy. If too much heat energy is allowed to build up inside the microprocessor, the temperature will rise high enough to destroy the microprocessor.

This problem is solved by the cooling system, which replaces that problem with another problem:
* The higher the peak power used by a microprocessor, the more expensive the up-front cost of the cooling system necessary to keep that processor from destroying itself.

==== The average power problem ====

* The higher the average power used by a microprocessor, the higher the cost to the person who uses that microprocessor. That person must not only pay for the electric power going into the microprocessor, but also pay for cooling to pump waste heat energy all the way from the microprocessor to the outside environment.

In some situations, there are other reasons to reduce power:
* Laptop designers want a small, lightweight laptop. The higher the average power used by a microprocessor, the heavier the battery must be for a given runtime.

== Heat ==

In microprocessors, power is mostly dissipated as heat energy. This conversion to heat energy is a function of the size of the wires and transistors, and the operating frequency of the processor. 

As transistors get smaller, the depletion region gets smaller, and current leaks through the transistor even when it is off. This leakage produces additional heat, and wastes additional power.

&lt;!--
As materials heat up, they are typically more resistive to electricity.

''How is this relevant? When heated, *metals* have higher resistance, but *semiconductors* have lower resistance ...''
--&gt;
Heat can also cause materials to expand, which can alter the electrical characteristics of the tiny transistors and wires.

Many small microcontrollers don't need to worry about heat because they generate so little, but larger modern general purpose processors typically need to be accompanied by heat sinks and fans to help cool the processor. If a processor is running too hot, typically it can be slowed down to a lower clock rate to help prevent heat build up.

As power is a function of the square of the voltage, approximately, if you can reduce the power supply voltage by half, you can reduce the power dissipation by possibly three quarters. Because of this, microprocessor chips are quite often designed to run at what were once considered impossibly low voltages. The initial microprocessor chips, the Intel 8080 and the Motorola MC6800, were designed to run at 5.0 volts. More modern microprocessors, like the AMD Athlon K7 chips, are designed to run at 1.65 volts or even lower.

It should be noted that, in order to prevent uncontrollable heat buildup, many modern general-purpose microprocessors dynamically turn off parts of the chip. A computer that is being used for purely integer calculations does not need its floating point unit, and so power to the entire FPU, except possibly the register stack, is turned off. Major sections of the microprocessor, then, can be turned on and off several times per millisecond. While this does cut down average power draw and heat dissipation, it does put extraordinary demands on the power supply for the chip, which can see power requirements that jump 50% in microseconds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One way you can find a queen bee in a hive that you can clearly see is to find an area where you see a large clump of bees all looking into one central area for a long period of time.  Also, some bees will repeatedly come and go from this same place.  In the middle of this clump, if you were to brush the workers away, you would most likely find the queen.  She is normally guarded by as many as 10-20 workers at one time.

Many times it is not necessary to locate the queen herself as there is likely a lot of evidence of her presence in the hive.  Eggs are the most compelling evidence that you've got a viable queen.  Look for a uniform deposition of eggs (if it's spotty it may be a laying worker or an old queen).

If I missed something in here, or if you have more info to add, please do edit this article.

Brood is capped 9 days after the egg being laid. The best sign of 'queen rightness' are eggs (second to seeing the queen herself). If you can find eggs they were laid in the last 3 days. A laying worker will generally stick eggs to the side, rather than bottom, of a cell as her abdomen is not long enough. Workers can only lay drones (male) as they will not be fertilised. You can alos get a drone laying queen however, if she is old, damaged or poorly mated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography==
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;High performance liquid chromatography has proven itself to very useful in many scientific fields, yet is limited in either speed or resolution. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) increases throughput and resolution, primarily based on the use of smaller particles for separations.  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The advantages are primarily based on the theories that underly liquid chromatography.  In general, increasing the efficiency of a separation will also increase its resolution.  Since both efficiency and optimum flow rate are inversely proportional to particle size, a decrease in the particle size will increase both efficiency and flow rate.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For example, the particle size can be as small as 1.7um compared to 3.5um or 5um that is typically used in HPLC.  The particles must be able to withstand high pressure, extreme pH, and have a high load capacity in order to improve efficiency.  Other innovations to the chromatography method include a high pressure solvent delivery system, to take into account the smaller particle size, fast injection cycle sample management, and specialized detectors with fiber optic flow cell design.

== UHPLC vs HPLC ==

A comparison between Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography and High Peformance Liquid Chromatography is shown in the table below: &lt;br&gt;

:The profession of Instructional Technology has recognized the need to respond to increasing pressure to create learning experiences or environments which can get &lt;br&gt;.... the right content to the right person at the right time for the right end-user/learner experience. 
&lt;br&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Pugliese Pugliese, L. C.(2002. The transformation of educational publishing: The emergence and growth of a teacher-centered learning-object environment. Technos: Quarterly for Education and Technology. Retrieved on April, 19, 2007, from http://www.ait.net/technos/tq_11/3pugliese.php.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt; Just-in-time learning needs to be flexible, individualized, timely, and meaningful. Learning objects can be viewed as fundamental building blocks which can be used to respond to the increasing demand for just-in-time learning. Creating learning objects which can be re-used by different learners or instructional designers, in different circumstances, under different contexts, will have a tremendous positive impact on responding to the need for just-in-time learning.

:There exists a vast number of individuals (e.g. teachers, instructional designers, business people) who are creating a vast and varied assortment of [[Instructional Technology/Learning Management Systems/Learning Objects]]. Currently, many learning objects are proprietary (say in business settings), or developed for a particular use (narrowly conceived) or developed in a particular format (which does not allow for easy transfer to another format). &lt;br&gt;Common methods for retrieving learning objects at this time are basically course portals, course packs, and learning object repositories.&lt;ref&gt; The source is taken from Design and Reusability of Learning Objects in an Academic Context: A New Economy of Education? in ''USDLA Journal'' by Stephen Downes http://www.usdla.org/html/journal/JAN03_Issue/article01.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

In order for a particular learning object to maximize it's potential to be re-used by other learners in different educational contexts, it is essential that a system be developed whereby learning objects can be identified, located, retrieved and used with relative ease. There are obstacles that currently exist which  make the re-use of learning objects very difficult, if not impossibe at times. &lt;br&gt; One such problem is that software vendors have standards which only they own and that can restrict use. Another problem is that some standards which are being used to develop learning objects (such as SCORM-Shareable Content Object Reference Model) may be too strict to allow easy exchanges. Standards such as this one may lack in flexibility even though SCORM's intention is to make the development of learning objects more uniform with the idea that uniformity creates ease of exchange. A third problem is with learning management systems which have their own databases where learning objects are deposited but not open for exhange. In other words, they are a closed system. Finally, another problem which requires tackling is the need to find a workable system to manage digital rights of the creators of the learning objects. &lt;ref&gt; This list of problems is taken from Design and Reusability of Learning Objects in an Academic Context: A New Economy of Education? in USDLA Journal by Stephen Downes http://www.usdla.org/html/journal/JAN03_Issue/article01.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Identifying, confronting and working through problems such as the ones identified will allow for

== How a Marketplace or a Learning-Object Publishing Economy Can Be Created ==

Stephen Downes (see reference 2)has proposed an architecture for a '''DLORN''' (distributed learning object repository).His architecture is comprised of a distributed network which would include the core components of:
::*a learning object repository (to be hosted by vendors on their sites where the vendors have the servers and create the metadata)
::*a metadata repository (which is hosted independently and which would harvest metadata)
::*eLearning system (which queries, retrieves and displays learning objects)

The design principles of a system such as DLORN as envisioned by Stephen Downes include the following:
::#Open Standards
::#Royalty free standards
::#Open-source infrasructure layer
::#Open or proprietary service layer
::#Component based  and distributed architecture
::#Open access
::#Open Market
::#Standards Tolerance
::#Multiple Channels
::#Multi-Party Metadata
::#Integration with the semantic web
::#Multiple data types

It is important to Stephen Downes that this model (DLORN) not be set up to mimic current models which are more like a '''Library Model''' where the learning materials are seen as similar to library books or learning resources which are managed. Rather, he envisions this network being able to create '''Learning Opportunities''' whereby a learner could access a learning object, a journal article, a class or seminar, or even instructors and coaches directly.

To make this proposed system work, there would be three critical steps as envisioned by Stephen Downes and these are:
::#Breaking down the different components of a Learning Content Management or Learning Management System in to distinct, stand-alone parts
::#Having multiple instances of these parts
::#Having these instances indexed ot registered

Stephen Downes is not the only party to be working hard in confronting obstacles and barriers to the development of a marketplace for learning objects. Louise Pugliese identified onCourse in her article where she states &lt;br&gt; this new model will be designed, in the long run, to support a marketplace of services designed to provide effective and efficient distribution of a wide array of standards-based digital learning objects and simple management tools that can be integrated with a variety of standards-based learner management systems. &lt;ref&gt; Pugliese, L. C.(2002). The transformation of educational publishing: The emergence and growth of a teacher-centered learning-object environment. Technos: Quarterly for Education and Technology. Retrieved on April, 19, 2007, from http://www.ait.net/technos/tq_11/3pugliese.php.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Learning objects are very important tools for Global Market because context independency supports the development of multi-language and multi-cultural resources with aid of simple XML files. Therefore, universities and international companies can support universal education or training without worrying about cultural and language issues (Lin, 2001).

==Overview==
This book is a collection of TI-BASIC programs and their codes.  By copying the code into your own TI-83+/TI-84 calculator, you will be able to use any of these programs on your own.

==Writing a Program==
There are just a few steps to follow in order to write a program onto your TI-83+ or TI-84 calculator using TI-BASIC.

#Turn on your calculator and press the PRGM button.
#Press the right arrow button twice to move to NEW.
#Press Enter to select Create New.
#Name the program.  If the program is of your own creation, give it whatever name you would like it to have using the letters above each button or any of the numbers 0-9.  If you are copying a program from this book, type in the name already given.
#Write the code of the program by using the digits and commands found on the calculator and by using the PRGM sub-menus while within the program code.  These menus contain lists of many of the most vital programming commands, such as If, Then, End, While, Menu(, and many others.  Other helpful menus of commands are the MATH, TEST, and DRAW command lists.

Note: Some of the programs in this book use lower-case letters in their program codes.  In order for a TI calculator user to type in lower-case letters you must have MirageOS on your calculator. You must also check the checkbox for Enable Lowercase in Miscellaneous Options on the Options screen within MirageOS.  The Options screen can be opened by pressing the ALPHA key in MirageOS.  RAOSX is also useful for enabling lowercase letters and other common assembly functions.

For the instructional wikibook on TI-BASIC programming, see [[TI-Basic Z80 Programming]].

==Introduction==
Chromatography separation consists of a stationary phase and a mobile phase. In a mixture of proteins, the target molecule interacts with the stationary while the rest of the proteins in the mixture remain in the mobile phase. As the name indicates, the mobile phase moves and flows out of the system. The target protein has been successfully isolated. The next step is to remove the target protein from the stationary phase and get it into the mobile phase. This is done by eluting the target molecule.

[[Image:stationaryVSmobile.png|thumb|300px|right|The mobile phase flows out of the system while molecules in the stationary phase remain immobile]]

[[Image:desorption.png|thumb|500px|right|In chromatography, the target protein is desorbed from the stationary phase to the mobile phase. This illustrates a desorption curve. During this time the sample is transferred from the stationary phase to the mobile phase due to altered buffer conditions]]

==State of Mobile Phase==

The mobile phase can be either liquid or gas. Gas chromatography is very widely used in analytical chemistry. It has less application to proteomics because the technique requires high temperatures which are often unsuitable for the large polymers involved in proteomics. Gas chromatography depends on the  partition equilibrium between a solid stationary phase and a gaseous mobile phase. Gas chromatography is almost always performed in a tube. The stationary phase usually consists of solid beads packed into a column adhered to a capillary tube.

A more useful mobile phase in proteomics is one that is in a liquid state. All of the techniques discussed in this chapter involve liquid chromatography. In this technique, there is traditionally a partition equilibrium between a solid stationary phase and a liquid mobile phase. Liquid chromatography is either carried out in a column or a plane.

==Shape of Stationary Phase==

The stationary phase is almost always solid, however, there are examples of chromatography experiments in which the stationary phase is in another state. For example, in counter current chromatography (CCC), both the mobile and stationary phase are liquid.

The shape of the stationary phase usually can take two forms:
#planar chromatography
#column chromatography

===Planar Chromatography===

This type of chromatography involves a stationary phase that is planar. The plane can consist of a layer of paper or a substance such as a gel that is supported by a glass plate. The mobile phase diffuses and is allowed to interact with the plane.

[[Image:paper.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Figure 2. Paper Chromatography. The components of the sample move up the paper at different rates. www.wikipedia.org]]

In paper chromatography, the target molecule is placed on chromatography paper. The mobile phase is a solvent. The solvent rises up the paper. When it reaches the sample, the solvent carries it with it. Different components of the sample travel at different rates thus separating the sample into strips. In thin layer chromatography, a matrix of gel or silica is used instead of paper. This tend to provide faster runs and better resolution than paper chromatography.

===Column Chromatography===

Column chromatography is probably the most common form of chromatography used in proteomics. The stationary phase is in a column. The column usually consists of a tightly packed bead matrix. The mobile phase enters the column and flows out at a constant rate. The column is usually coupled to a detection device such as a mass spectometry device. the absorption of the sample can be measured as it flows out of the column. This way, any protein that has been eluted in the mobile phase can be detected.

Chromatography is a method of separating molecule. The method takes advantage of differences between a mobile phase and a stationary phase to separate the different components in a mixture. The target molecules can interact with the stationary phase based on characteristics such as charge, size, and hydrophobicity.

There are two theories of Chromatography:
#Plate theory
#Rate theory

===Plate Theory of Chromatography===
Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge created the plate theory of chromatography. The plate theory describes the stationary phase and the mobile phase as being in equilibrium. The partition coefficient ''k'' between these two plates can be defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;K = \frac{Concentration\ of\ solute\ in\ stationary\ phase} {Concentration\ of\ solute\ in\ mobile\ phase}&lt;/math&gt;

As ''k'' increases, the time it takes for the solutes to separate increases. If chromatography is being performed in a column of fixed length and flow rate, the retention time &lt;math&gt;(t_R)&lt;/math&gt; and retention volume &lt;math&gt;(V_r)&lt;/math&gt; can be measured and used to determine the value of ''K''.

===Rate Theory of Chromatography===

Rate theory was introduced by van Deemter to account for chromatographic behavior that could not be explained by plate theory. Rate theory is based on three terms: path-dependent diffusion (A),longitudinal diffusion (B) and mass transfer (C).  

A. Path-dependent diffusion occurs when the packing in a chromatography column is not uniform, so that two identical analytes may migrate differently because one had further to travel than the other.

B. Longitudinal diffusion is the result of materials moving from an area of high concentration (the center of a band on a chromatography column) to an area of low concentration (the outside edges of the same band). Longitudinal diffusion increases with increasing temperature.

C. Mass transfer effects result from the fact that materials take time to equilibrate between the stationary and mobile phases. While that time is elapsing, the mobile phase is still moving. This leads to band broadening.

I began at Wikibooks at the begining of 2007. I am a native speaker of English and live in Australia. My interests are in ancient history, especially around the Mediterranean. At school I learnt Latin from the [http://www.oxford-latin.net/OLC_main.htm Oxford Latin Course] having swapped from the [http://www.cambridgescp.com/page.php?p=clc^top^home Cambridge Latin Course]. I am trying to teach myself Ancient Greek from the [http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/greek/ Athenaze Course] and I intend to help with these languages until the project overtakes my knowledge and then to learn from them. I am also on English Wikipedia under the same username.

'''''Salvia''''' is a genus in the mint family, [[../Lamiaceae/]]. It is one of three genera commonly referred to as Sage. When used without modifiers, sage generally refers to common sage (''[[../Salvia officinalis/]]''); however, it can be used with modifiers to refer to any member of the genus. This genus includes shrubs, herbaceous perennials, and annuals. Different species of sage are grown as herbs and as ornamental plants. The ornamental species are commonly referred to by their scientific name ''Salvia''. 

The closely related genera ''[[../Perovskia/]]'' and ''[[../Phlomis/]]'' are also known as sage; Russian Sage (''[[../Perovskia atriplicifolia/]]''), native to the Crimea south to Afghanistan and Pakistan, is grown as an ornamental plant, because of its blue-violet sprays of flowers and its adaptability to either sun or part shade. It has a pleasant smell and is also grown as a bee plant, but is not consumed by humans. Jerusalem Sage refers to ''[[../Phlomis fruticosa/]]'' and other species of ''Phlomis''.

Some species of the unrelated genus ''[[../Artemisia/]]'' are also referred to as sages, a shortened version of ''sagebrush'', which is a more appropriate term for them. They generally taste vile and are not used in food preparation, although many of them are used medicinally. Smudge bundles are made with various grey-leaved species of ''Artemisia'' and are misrepresented as &quot;whitesage&quot; smudges. The true whitesage is ''Salvia apiana'', which has a delightful scent when burned.

==Description==
Shrubs and freely branching herbs with stems that are square in cross-section, with opposite, simple leaves that lack stipules. The flowers are showy, borne in false whorls around the stem (called verticillasters), with the inflorescence overall resembling a spike. Fruit contains 4 1-seeded nutlets.

All members of the genus are glandular and emit fragrant oils.

==Growing conditions==
Rich, well-drained soils. Most species do best in full sun.

==Species==
see [[w:List of Salvia species]]

==Uses==
The sage species used as herbs come from the Mediterranean and Asia Minor. Sage has also been grown in central Europe since the Middle Ages.

The name ''Salvia'' derives from the Latin 'salveo', which means 'to heal', and the herb is highly regarded for its healing qualities. An ancient proverb states, &quot;Why should a man die who has sage in his garden?&quot;. The ancient Greeks used it to treat tuberculosis, ulcers and snake bites.

The Ancient Romans considered sage to be a sacred herb and followed an elaborate ceremony when harvesting it. A sage gatherer would  use a special knife (not made of iron as it reacts with the sage), have to have clean clothes and clean feet and a sacrifice of food would have to be made before he could begin. The Romans would use it for toothpaste; they also believed it to be good for the brain, senses and memory. 

The Chinese also were quite partial to this herb. 17th century Dutch merchants found that they would trade one chest of sage leaves for three of their teas [http://www.selfsufficientish.com/sage.htm].

Sages are also used by several Native American cultures.

In modern gardens, sages are grown primarily as ornamental or culinary plants, for their good foliage and attractive flowers. They are also often planted to attract hummingbirds.

==Maintenance==
Deadhead to encourage repeat blooming

==Propagation==
Division, cuttings, or seed.

* non-aromatic varieties (not considered medicinal, but many still have a scent)
* Chia sages
* ''Divinorum'' (Diviner's sage) contains a diterpenoid used for spiritual and recreational purposes.
* Alzhiemer's disease, research has shown that it improves cognitive function over a period of several months &lt;ref&gt;http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdf?vid=19&amp;hid=119&amp;sid=3ed5146a-be26-4910-a86e-f5ff50f1028f%40sessionmgr103 &lt;/ref&gt;.

The aromatic sages strengthen the lungs and can be used in teas or tinctures to prevent coughs. Less aromatic species of ''Salvia'' are run-of-the-mill mint-family anti-inflammatories, which means that they can be used for pretty much any infection or inflammation, and will give at least some relief.

Common sage (''[[../Salvia officinalis/]]'') drunk as a cold tea will stop sweating, while the same tea drunk hot will produce sweating. Cold and hot teas will also either stop or enhance [[milk]] production. The [[essential oil]] is used in [[aromatherapy]] and [[medicine]].

[[White sage]] (''Salvia apiana'') is a very strong general [[anti-inflammatory]], used as tea or tincture. The tincture has a very nice scent and can be used as a [[perfume]]. This species is the famous whitesage of smudge sticks.

[[Pineapple sage]] (''Salvia elegans'', old: ''S. rutilans'') is a tender perennial with pineapple-scented leaves. Medicinally, this is perhaps closest to the [[scented geraniums]], a sweet-smelling ''[[Pelargonium]]'' species.

[[Red sage]] (''Salvia miltiorrhiza'') is used medicinally in [[Traditional Chinese medicine]].

'''Chia sages'''. The seeds of these species are used as [[bulk laxatives]], much like the seeds of [[Psyllium]] (''Plantago'' spp.) or [[linseed]]. [[Chia]] has been important in the diet of desert Indians. It is still used for its [[Mucilage|mucilaginous]] qualities by Mexican natives.

[[Diviner's sage]] (''Salvia divinorum'') also called Yerba de la Pastora or sometimes just ''Salvia'', is a plant that differs from all the other sages. It is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] visionary herb and there is some evidence it is a true [[cultivar]]. It is known to have strong [[psychoactive]] properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to measuring words ==
Unlike English, measuring words are needed when you need to say an object. For example we only need to say a book in English, but in Cantonese, when have to put a measuring word in front of the object, like 一本書.
Here is a table of some measuring words:
{| border=1 
| Measuring word
| Pronunciation
| When to use
| Example
|-
| 本
| bun2
| a flat object, but not very thin
| Book書
|-
| 個
| go3
| an irregular object
| Apple蘋果, orange橙
|-
| 塊
| faai3
| an irregular, flatten object
| cookie曲奇餅
|-
| 張
| zoeng1
| a very thin and flat object
| paper紙, ticket飛
|-
| 隻
| zek3
| an animal that is not flat; non-elongated object
| chicken雞, cow牛, egg雞蛋, watch錶
|-
| 條
| tiu4
| an animal that is flat; an elongated object
| fish魚, crocodile鱷魚, rope繩, belt皮帶, trousers褲, straw飲管
|-

| Use for wood 木, rice 飯 etc.
|}
===Practice===
Imagine you are doing shopping and need to get some grocery from a shopkeeper.  Study the following dialogues and make your own version with the above examples of measuring words:

店員：你想買乜嘢？

我：我想買'''一隻雞'''。

Translation:

Shopkeeper: What would you like?

Me: I want to buy a chicken.

(i386)
Rev 0.8 2007-04-11
Francois BIENTZ (francois.bientz@voila.fr)

Document based on the How-to :Setup WebObjects on Linux (Stefan Apelt) :
http://www.tetlabors.de/wo/setup_webobjects_on_linux.html.
Other platforms http://www.tetlabors.de/wo/

Thanks to 
Stefan Apelt, Ari Maniatis and Piotr Intres (Gentoo install)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

What you need :
*FreeBSD 6.2 X86 box
*a Mac and OSX 10.4.9 XCode 2.4.1, WebObjects 5.3.3 dev installed.
*or a Mac and OSX 10.4.9 server WebObjects 5.3.3 deploy installed.  



==Install Java and Apache==
You can can build and install the native Java 
- using the ports system (see http://www.freebsd.org/java)
- or download the diablo Java 1.5 package from the FreeBSD foundation:http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/downloads/java.shtml
file: diablo-jdk-freebsd6.i386.1.5.0.07.01.tbz. 

Install Apache : I used  apache13 from ports/www

==WebObjects 5.3.3 installation from OSX or OSX server==

On FreeBSD create these directories:
&lt;pre&gt;
/usr/local/apple/Library
/usr/local/apple/Local/Library
&lt;/pre&gt;

Directories/Files to copy from OSX to FreeBSD:

== Install the Apache adaptor for FreeBSD ==

edit /etc/profile and add :
&lt;pre&gt;
NEXT_ROOT=/usr/local/apple
export NEXT_ROOT
OS= FREEBSD
export OS
&lt;/pre&gt;
log off an log in (with a user login) then su

* [http://wonder.sourceforge.net/WOAdaptor.html Download the binary for FreeBSD 6.1] or
* [http://www.tetlabors.de/wo/setup_webobjects_on_freebsd.html Compile using Wo 5.2 Solaris]

Copy mod_WebObjects.so into /usr/local/libexec/apache.

== Configure Apache for WebObjects ==

Copy the configuration file for WebObjects  to the Apache conf folder: 
 cp webobjects.conf /usr/local/etc/apache/

The webobjects.conf file :
&lt;pre&gt;
# WebObjects : Enable the WebObjects module.


LoadModule WebObjects_module /usr/local/libexec/apache/mod_WebObjects.so
#AddModule mod_WebObjects.c

# Path to the Document Root of your Webserver, 
# it should contain a directory named WebObjects
WebObjectsDocumentRoot /usr/local/www/data

# You can change the 'cgi-bin' part of WebObjectsAlias to whatever you
# prefer (such as Apps), but the 'WebObjects' part is required.
WebObjectsAlias /cgi-bin/WebObjects

# Here are the 3 possible configuration modes.
# The apache module uses one of them to get information
# about your deployed applications.
# 1085 is the reserved port on which wotaskd processes listen to by default.

# Host List Configuration
# wotaskd is started automatically on supported platforms,
# so this is the default mode.
# The apache module gets its configuration from the wotaskds
# listed on the configuration line
# For multiple hosts:
# WebObjectsConfig http://&lt;name-of-a-host&gt;:&lt;port-on-a-host&gt;,http://&lt;name-of-another-host&gt;:&lt;port-on-a-host&gt; &lt;interval&gt;
# For localhost: 
WebObjectsConfig http://localhost:1085 10

# Multicast Configuration
# The apache module gets its configuration from all wotaskds
# that respond to the multicast call on the subnet
# WebObjectsConfig webobjects://239.128.14.2:1085 10

# File Configuration
# The apache module gets its configuration from one file
# WebObjectsConfig file://&lt;path-to-a-xml-config-file&gt; 10


# To enable public access to the WOAdaptorInfo page, uncomment the following line
# WebObjectsAdminUsername public

# To enable the WOAdaptorInfo page with restricted access,
# uncomment the next two lines and set the user and password
# To access the WOAdaptorInfo page with restricted access, 
# use a URL like: http://webserver/cgi-bin/WebObjects/WOAdaptorInfo?user+password.
# WebObjectsAdminUsername user
# WebObjectsAdminPassword password

# To change the logging options, read the following comments:
# The option name is &quot;WebObjectsLog&quot; and the first value indicates the path of the log file.
# The second value indicates the log level. There are five, in decreasing informational order:
# 	&quot;Debug&quot;,    &quot;Info&quot;,    &quot;Warn&quot;,    &quot;Error&quot;,    &quot;User&quot;
#
# Note: To enable logging, touch '/tmp/logWebObjects' as the administrator user (usually root).
#
# The following line is the default:
# WebObjectsLog /tmp/WebObjects.log Debug
&lt;/pre&gt;


Edit /usr/local/etc/apache/httpd.conf. Search for the line &quot;LoadModule
rewrite_module ...&quot; and insert the following lines right _before_ it:

Include /usr/local/etc/apache/webobjects.conf
&lt;Location /cgi-bin/./&gt;
SetHandler WebObjects
&lt;/Location&gt;

Search for the line  &quot;AddModule mod_rewrite.c&quot; and put the following
line right _after_ that:

AddModule mod_WebObjects.c

Search for a line &quot;ServerName ...&quot; and put your DNS host name in there.
If you do not have one, you can use your IP address, too. The explanation
within httpd.conf about this is very good.

ServerName yourhost.yourdomain.com

Save and exit. Now, to see if everything is right, try:

 /usr/local/sbin/apachectl configtest

If it says &quot;Syntax OK&quot;, you are fine. Else, try to find and correct the
errors it reports.

== Start Apache and WO Services ==

Start Apache:
/usr/local/sbin/apachectl start

Start wotaskd :
$NEXT_ROOT/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/wotaskd &amp;


== Start JavaMonitor and test the installation ==

The last step before adding application is starting JavaMonitor and see
if it works:
$NEXT_ROOT/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/JavaMonitor.woa/JavaMonitor
-WOPort 56789

After JavaMonitor is launched, you will see a line similar to the
following:

Your application's URL is:
http://yourhost.yourdomain.com:56789/cgi-bin/WebObjects/JavaMonitor.woa

Open this URL in a web browser.


== Create startup scripts for wotaskd and javamonitor ==

Install lsof from the ports

Create /usr/local/etc/rc.d/110.wotaskd.sh
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

NEXTROOT=/usr/local/apple

case &quot;$1&quot; in
        start)
                
           export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
           export NEXT_ROOT=${NEXTROOT}
           ${NEXTROOT}/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/wotaskd.woa/wotaskd &amp;
           echo -n ' wotaskd'
                
           ;;
        stop)
           lsof -i tcp:1085 |grep LISTEN | sort -u | awk '{print&quot;kill -9 &quot; $2}' | sh
                ;;
        *)
           echo &quot;&quot;
           echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` { start | stop }&quot;
           echo &quot;&quot;
           exit 64
                ;;
esac
&lt;/pre&gt;
Then
  chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/110.wotaskd.sh
Create /usr/local/etc/rc.d/150.javamonitor.sh
&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/sh

NEXTROOT=/usr/local/apple

case &quot;$1&quot; in
        start)
           export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
           export NEXT_ROOT=${NEXTROOT}
           ${NEXTROOT}/Library/WebObjects/JavaApplications/JavaMonitor.woa/JavaMonitor -WOPort 56789 &amp;
           echo -n 'JavaMonitor'
                        ;;
        stop)
           lsof -i tcp:56789 |grep LISTEN | sort -u |awk '{print&quot;kill -9 &quot;$2}' | sh
            ;;
        *)
           echo &quot;&quot;
           echo &quot;Usage: `basename $0` { start | stop }&quot;
           echo &quot;&quot;
           exit 64
            ;;
esac
&lt;/pre&gt;
Then
  chmod +x /usr/local/etc/rc.d/150.javamonitor.sh

== JDBC jars location. ==
for mySQL: put the mysql-connector-java-5.0.3-bin.jar in /usr/local/apple/Local/Library/WebObjects/Extensions.

'''''Salvia guaranitica''''' ('''Anise-scented sage''' or Hummingbird sage) is a species of sage native to South America, including Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. 

==Description==
It is a perennial or subshrub growing 1-3 m tall. The leaves are ovate, 4-13 cm long, mint green, and anise-scented when crushed. The inflorescences are up to 25 cm long, with each flower 3-5 cm long in varying shades of blue, with a dark basal calyx 10-12 mm long. Flowering begins in mid summer and continues through late autumn.

Salvia guaranitica is only a perennial in USDA Zones 7 to 10, but can be perennial in cooler climates, if planted in sunny microclimate.

==Growing conditions==
Deep, well-drained soils with adequate irrigation during drought periods. Water needs are low.  In colder climates, the plant should be sited against a building or masonry.

==Varieties==
Numerous cultivars have been selected, including:
*'Argentine Skies' (pale blue flowers)
*'Black and Blue' (very dark violet blue calyx)
*'Blue Enigma' (green calyx and blue flowers
*'Blue Ensign' (large blue flowers)
*'Purple Splendor' (large purple flowers)

==Uses==
''Salvia guaranitica'' is a popular ornamental plant in mild areas where the temperature does not fall below &amp;minus;12 °C. It is most often planted in order to attract hummingbirds.

==Maintenance==
Prune to the ground in early spring, before new stems grow. Can be sheared to encourage bushiness.  Staking is sometimes necessary.  Excellent container plant.

==Propagation==
Division or stem cuttings. In colder climates, it can be dug in early autumn and kept indoors either in a pot or in vermiculite for dormant storage. It's hardiness can be greatly extended if planted against a building or masonry to maintain higher winter soil temperatures.

==Pests and diseases==
See ''[[../Salvia/]]'' for a list of pests and diseases affecting the genus ''Salvia''.

==Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography==
High performance liquid chromatography has proven itself to very useful in many scientific fields, yet forces scientists to consistently choose between speed and resolution. Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC*) eliminates the need to choose and creates a highly efficient method that is primarily based on small particle separations.

Ultra high pressure liquid chromatography, also known as ultra HPLC (UPLC), is a form of column chromatography used to separate, identify, and quantify compounds. It allows for separation and analysis of small particles both quickly and effectively. Liquid Chromatography is the process of passing a mixture of particles to be separated through a column. This allows the analyte, which was separated from the mixture, to be measured from other molecules. The columns are filled with a packing material, known as the stationary phase. In UPLC a pump pushes the mixture, known as the mobile phase, through the columns. As the mobile phase is passing through the stationary phase a detector shows the retention times of the different molecules. Retention time varies depending on the interactions between the stationary phase, the molecules being analyzed, and the solvent used.

The theory behind the development of UPLC is the van Deemter equation. The van Deemter equation is an empirical formula that shows the relationship between linear velocity, also known as flow rate, and plate height, also known as column efficiency. Since particle size is one of the variables of the van Deemter equation, the curve generated can be used to investigate chromatographic performance. As the particle size decreases to less than 2.5 μm, there is a significant gain in efficiency even when flow rates are increased or when linear velocities are increased.

[[Image:Van-deemter.jpg|frame: Graph of Van-deemter Equation]]

Besides efficiency, the advantage of working with small particles is the fact that small particles can work at higher linear velocities. This allows for increases resolution and speed. Resolution is proportional to the square root of N, which is inversely related to both particle size and peak width. Peak width is inversely related to peak height. This means that the use of smaller particles will allow for narrower, taller peaks; greater resolution. It is also important to note that as particle size decreases the optimum flow increases. However, pressure is proportional to flow rate so smaller particles will require higher energy or pressure.

Current HPLC technology could not suffice for the new pressures associated with UPLC; a new system was designed by Waters called ACQUITY UPLC. Waters ACQUITY Ultra Performance LC systems have been developed to take into account all the advantages that small particle separations currently have over HPLC. This task was not easy. A new hybrid material was invented for the columns called Bridged Ethyl Hybrid (BEH). Also the columns needed a smoother interior surface. ACQUITY UPLC BEH columns also include microchip technology that captures the manufacturing information for each column, including the quality control tests and certificates of analysis called eCord™. The eCord database is also updated with real time method information, such as the number of injections, or pressure and temperature information, to maintain a complete continuous column history. 

Many of these advantages are primarily based on the theories behind liquid chromatography. In general, increasing the efficiency of a separation will also increase its resolution. Since both efficiency and optimum flow rate are inversely proportional to particle size, a decrease in the particle size will increase efficiency and speed up the flow rate.

In the ACQUITY system, the particle size is decreased to 1.7um compared to 3.5um or 5um. The particles were specifically designed to withstand wide ranges of pressure and pH, have a high load capacity, and improve efficiency. Other innovations to the chromatography method include a high pressure solvent delivery system, to take into account the smaller particle size, fast injection cycle sample management, and specialized detectors with fiber optic flow cell design.


*UPLC is a term trademarked by the WATERS corporation. Elsewhere, the technique is generally referred to as Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (uHPLC).

== uHPLC vs HPLC ==

A comparison between Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography and High Peformance Liquid Chromatography is shown in the table below: &lt;br&gt;
{| width=&quot;400&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| &lt;strong&gt;Attribute&lt;/strong&gt;
| &lt;strong&gt;HPLC&lt;/strong&gt;
| &lt;strong&gt;uHPLC&lt;/strong&gt;
|-
| '''Pressure'''
| 6000 Psi
| 100,000 Psi
|-
|'''Particle Size'''
| 5μm
| 1.7μm
|-
|'''Flow Rate'''
| Milliliters per minute
| Microliters per minute
|-
|'''Max Resolution'''
| Relatively low
| Relatively high
|-
|}

The lower bead size is the true reason for uHPLC increased flow rate and resolution. This can be shown mathematically using deemter's equation: H = A + B/µ + Cµ.  H being the plate height and µ being the particle size. The A constant remains constant independent of flow rate (it is referred to as the 'Eddy diffusion term'). The B constant is the diffusion coefficient, and C is the &quot;analyte mass transfer&quot; coefficient. As µ decreases, the A and C values of needed for a similar H value decrease, allowing for higher resolution. This also reduces the effect of the C value on the H value,   yielding faster separations for similar resolutions. Note uHPLC out classes HPLC in all aspects, and is expected to replace HPLC in the near future.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Chapters 18-19 chapters including Jesus' death are called Passion Narratives.  They describe Jesus' Passion or suffering.  &quot;The term suits the Synoptics better than John, where Jesus scarcely suffers anguish or pain,&quot; (Smith 322).  

'''Historically, who would be concerned that Jesus be apprehended?'''  John 18:3 states, &quot;So Judas brought a detachment of soldiers together with police from the chief priests and the Pharisees, and they came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.&quot;  Later on in this same chapter the narrator of John states that, Caiaphas, &quot;the high priest that year...was the one who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one person die for the people.&quot;  The Gospel of John seems to imply that it was the high priests that were interested in apprehending Jesus.  However, historically, there seems to be something wrong with this.  After all, while all the gospels seem to agree that Jesus was clashing with the Pharisees, there is no reason that high priests would be interested in apprehending Jesus just because of that.  Plus, it would make more sense that the Jews would wait to deal with Jesus after the Passover was over, yet in the Gospel of John, Jesus' death occurs during Passover.  Then, why was Jesus apprehended by the Jewish leaders?  While high priests during Jesus' time were the highest representatives of Jewish self-government, they were ultimately ruled by the Romans.  The Romans would keep high priests &quot;in line&quot; by holding onto their priestly garments.  Therefore, the Jews were not really &quot;self-governed.&quot;  Therefore, it makes sense that the Romans would have been interested in apprehending Jesus.  In order to understand the Romans' motives for doing this, the story of John the Baptist can be used: John the Baptist was apparently put to death for criticizing Herod; however, Josephus, a &quot;1st century Jewish historian,&quot; (Wikipedia) seemed to believe that the actual reason was that John the Baptist was gathering crowds that were willing to fight or die for John the Baptist's cause.  The Romans were most likely aware that they had to put the root of the crowd issue, John the Baptist, to death in order to maintain order.  This is a similar situation to Jesus'.  The Romans probably wanted to apprehend Jesus because they were attempting to preserve their own views about God and maintain order in their kingdom.  If this is true, then why was Jesus brought to Caiaphas?  Most likely, the Jews handed Jesus over to Roman hands to overt bloodshed; in other words, they wanted to give Jesus to the Romans before the Romans sent in their own troops and killed many people.  This is why the line, &quot;it was better to have one person die for the people&quot; makes sense in historical terms.  
Questions for clarification: In verses 15 and 16, who is the 'other disciple'?  Why does the servant-girl question Peter, by asking, 'You are not one of this man's disciples too, are you?&quot; and does not question and include the 'other disciple'? Does she know him, this 'other disciple'?

'''Pilate, Christ, and Prophecy in John 18'''  In verses 28-40, Christ converses with Pilate about His fate.  This is an interesting juncture for many reasons, but I wish to focus on the motives of Pilate.  Moments such as this are realizations of earlier prophecies that have a predetermined destination.  In this case, that destination is the death of Christ and the creation of the Christian variety of salvation through faith.  The question I'm wrestling with, though, is how much leeway Pilate had in his actions.  Do you believe he could have released Christ, or was he bound by the &quot;will of God&quot;?  And, if one believes that Pilate's will was completely overridden by God's will, then how does that gel with the notion of free will?  There are specific points (ironically, the most influential points in Christian history) that are ascribed these &quot;will of God&quot; characteristics, in which man's will is eclipsed.  Does the notion of free will, then, by its absence in the most important moments in Christian history, lose its integrity?

Jesus is very careful in his answers to Pilate's questions. Verses 33-40 show Pilate seemingly trying to catch Jesus in a tricky place. Jesus would have been accused of treason if he had answered &quot;yes&quot; to the question, &quot;Are you the king of the Jews?&quot;. Though he does not say it in that many words, he lets Pilate know that, regardless what Pilate calls it, Jesus is on the earth to point out the truth. If Pilate wants to label that as &quot;King of the Jews,&quot; he may. This keeps Jesus from the treason accusation: in explaining that his kingdom is not within the realm of Roman politics, Jesus cannot be accused of crimes against Rome. 

'''Peter's Denial of Christ'''
Peter, a beloved disciple of Christ fulfills Christ's prophesy in chapter 18. Previously in chapter 13 Jesus answers Peter's profession of laying down his life for Him saying &quot;Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, Truly, I say to you, a cock shall not crow, until you deny Me three times.&quot; (NAS)At first, Peter's character is strong and he seems to have a true passion and belief in Christ. Then as time goes by, this strong character turns into Peter believing he is indestructible as he strikes the high priest's slave and cuts off his right ear. However, this strong willed and overly confident follower begins to lag behind and does not enter into the court of the high priest. ( v.15) 
Here is where Peter begins to deny Christ. First in verse 17 a slave-girl asks Peter if He is a follower, he replies &quot;I am not.&quot; (NAS) Then, while the man he has followed for the past three years is in questioning, Peter goes to warm himself at the fire the slave and officers had built. They ask again, &quot;You are not also one of His disciples, are you?&quot; and Peter replies &quot;I am not.&quot;  (NAS, v. 18)
However, one of the slaves knew that Peter was in the garden with Jesus and questions him again, and just as Christ prophesied, Peter denied Him the third time.  (v.27) The cock then immediately crowed just as Jesus had said in chapter 13. What is interesting about this in John is that the cock only crows once in this book. In addition to that, only one of the synoptic gospels (Mark) writes it down as the crock crowing twice. With that said, the rest of the gospels mirror John very well in this chapter. The language of Peter in these denials is very interesting as well. Some see his answers “I am not” signifies a deeper opposition to Christ. Being that “I am” is a widely used phrase by Christ and is sometimes known as the “divine name.” This name is seen even in chapter 18, when Judas and his detachment of soldiers come to arrest Jesus. This name is so powerful that, as soon as Jesus identified himself as &quot;I Am,&quot; the soldiers fell away from him.  Another interesting fact, lies in Jesus' foreknowledge of Peter's denial.  Does Peter have control over his own actions?  Do those involved have control over ''their'' actions?  This once again (a common theme and question in the gospel of John) raises questions about self-determination and the legitimacy of free-will.  Peter's three denials also have a significance in biblical numerology.  The number three is often used to represent the trinity.  Jesus also asks Peter &quot;do you love me?&quot; three times to mirror his betrayals.

'''The Other Disciple'''

Along with the uniquely Johannine character of &quot;the Beloved disciple&quot; is this &quot;other disciple&quot; found in verse 15 of chapter 18, &quot;Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard&quot;.  Many have postulated that this mysterious figure might in fact be the beloved disciple found elsewhere in John, however, in his commentary on John, D. Moody Smith points out that is somewhat strange that if this is intended to be the same individual why does John not simply say so?  The fact that the disciple is known to the high priest may suggest that he was a native of Jerusalem, and since the beloved disciple appears only in Jerusalem in John's narrative it is not implausible that they are the same person.  Smith also points out that some have tried to identify this figure with the gospel writer himself, and though John of Zebedee, often attributed with writing this gospel, was a fisherman, it was not impossible that he may have been known to the high priest through a business relationship. 

'''John 18:1-11'''
''John'' tells the passion story in a unique way.  It begins with the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, a brutal arrest of an innocent man, and the abuse of power by armed guards.  But there is another way of interpreting this story—Jesus freely chose to place himself before his enemies because of his immense authority of his sacred person.  Jesus is in control even at the moment of his arrest. Jesus will freely and willingly &quot;drink the cup&quot; of the passion because in so doing he fulfills his duty of revealing God's love for the world.

''John's'' passion story: the tragedy of cruel death is overwhelmed by the power of redemptive love. For John, Jesus is the Word made flesh, sent to reveal the abiding love of God for the world. The most compelling statement of that love is, ironically, the death of Jesus. In giving his life &quot;for his friends&quot; (15:13), Jesus reveals God's overwhelming love for the world. From the perspective of faith, the death of Jesus is a word of life (D. Senior, 2007).

'''Some Differences (in the beginning) between John and the Synoptics'''

When reading all the different accounts of the Passion narrative, there are quite a few differences that can be pointed out between them.  For one, in John it says that Jesus and the disciples went out across the Kidron Valley to a nameless garden where within minutes  they met Judas and the betrayal began.  In the synoptics the garden is named Gethsemane and it is here that Jesus prays first and then finds his disciples asleep.  In John he has prayed before they ever reached the garden.  Another difference is the kiss.  In John there is no kiss and Jesus, as stated earlier hands himself over almost freely.  In the synoptics, Judas betrays him with a kiss.  Thes are just a few of the many differences between all the accounts of the Passion narratives in the gospels.

Remember the old saying about estimating the time  and doubling it to come up with something  reasonable. A complete bike restoration can take several months to years. It’s probably going to take more time for several reasons. Most likely you'd be fitting the work around other things happening in your life, expect lots of interruptions and delays. You tend to discover parts that need replacement as the project is proceeding. Sometimes parts need to be sent away for servicing or they might not be readily available and you have to find them.  Then there is the money thing. What level of perfection do I want, and how much is it going to cost. ''It always takes longer and cost more than you think''

'''Teardown.'''   
Having a bike broken down into five hundred pieces at the end of the day can give one a terrific sense of accomplishment. ''Don't do it!''. Putting everything back the right way and in the right place is the hard part. Here are some suggestions that might help.

[[image:Freezbag.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[Freezer bag with parts]]]

1) The time between the teardown stage and assembly will take a while. Knowing exactly where things belong at some point in the distant future can save you an enormous amount of time. Invest in a selection of different sized freezer bags that have the nifty seals and a place for writing a label. As a part comes off, clean it with its respective fasteners, washers, gaskets etc. Put the pieces into a bag and label what it is and where it goes. Apart from left, right, front and back  some things like carburetors, pistons and valves require referencing to the cylinder numbers. The plastic bags also protect the parts from corrosion. Spending extra time staying organized at this stage will have a huge payback six months from now when assembly starts.

2) Set parts aside that require further repairs or refinishing before assembly. Sometimes it's nice to have a few jobs that can be completed in an hour or so.

3) Follow the shop manual as you take things apart. If your not sure where to start or how things work, the manual will tell you. If you have a digital camera take lots of pictures especially areas that look complicated. 

4) Invest in good tools. Fortunately you don’t need a lot of tools to work on a bike. A must is a set of 6 point sockets(not 12 point)in ¼’and 3/8” drives and a good selection of extensions. Universals and wobble extensions are handy to have for tight spaces. A set of hex sockets for ¼” drive are also a must have. For assembly you need a torque wrench. The newer types that go “click” are slick. Combination, box and open end wrenches, use them where you have to, but make sure they are in good shape. Hopefully Philip head screws will be a thing of the past some day, but until they are an impact driver is the best way to get them out.
 
5) Avoid damaging or breaking parts. A broken bolt may use up your valuable time attempting to remove it, or worse, destroying the part your working on. Parts for older bikes are expensive and hard to find. You just have to walk around a salvage yard to see bikes that have been scrapped because the parts needed for repairs are too expensive or not available. Not sure how to remove a rusty bolt with the stripped head. Here is practical advice from someone with years of experience on all aspects of MC repair [http://www.dansmc.com/MC_repaircourse.htm See Dan's advice] 

6) Bikes built since the early 1980’s have lots of plastic and rubber components. These tend to become more fragile with age. So be careful.

6) If you don't have the special service tools specified in the manual. Make sure what you do use as a substitute will work without causing damage.

7) If you are fortunate enough to be working with a bike that runs. Test as many systems as possible before hand to identify problems and determine which parts need to be replaced or repaired. 

8) If you’re uncertain about a procedure, the Nighthawk Groups in the links section are always very helpful.

9) Start looking for replacement parts as soon as possible even if your not buying right away just to get an idea what is available. Ebay and the  various online groups are good sources as well as MC salvage yards. Parts for items that wear out, tend to still be available from Honda or other aftermarket supplier.

10) Don't get overwhelmed with the job.  Break it down into smaller steps, each with a beginning and a finished end. 

11) Gas tanks seem to get more easily damaged off the bike than on. Store them in a safe place, preferably far away from your work area.

12) You don't like wrenching on motorcycles but want a cheap bike,'' don't even start''.

Stripped an internal thread here is how to fix it [http://lwww.roadstarmagazine.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=233 Using a Helocoil insert]

'''1985 750 Nighthawk S'''

If your complete restoration of the bike includes major engine work,I would suggest the following teardown order to make engine removal as painless as possible..
1)	Seat 2) Gas tank 3) Exhaust pipes, 4) Rear tire 5) Air box with boots. 6) Engine. 

[[image:Barebones.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[1985 CB750S Nighthawk S]]]

'''Engine Removal'''

Ref 5-2 Remove both ends of the hoses and look out for the O rings 

Ref 5-4 Subframes (are these on 750SC’s  also?)

Ref 5-4 Remove and examine gear shift position switch check for continuity. Ref 21-8 

Ref 5-5 (Top) Engine Removal. The manual makes this job sound like a Sunday stroll.

If you’re planning to take the carbs off, this is a great time to do it and make a little extra room to squeeze the engine out of the right side.  If you happen to be on the Olympic weightlifting team follow the manual. . If not, here is what works.

Save the frame paint, wrap it with some thin padding along the bottom right cradle tube where the oil pan has to clear.  To have good control, you need to pull from the top, not push from the bottom as the manual suggests. To do this, locate the bike under a ceiling joist or roof rafter.  Attach a light chain or rope hoist at a point above the engine to the joist.  On the bike remove the two outside acorn nuts from each side of the head and make up two short straps from seatbelt material or a 1/16” X 1 1/4 steel strapping. Cut or drill two holes to suite the bolt spacing on the head in each strap. Attach the straps (use flat washers with the seat belt material). Next attach each end of a rope about 8 feet long to the straps in such a way as to make a bridle with the spine of the frame in the middle. Attach the bridle to the hoist and lift to take the full strain of the motor. Lift the motor just enough to make sure all of the engine mounts are free. Have a peek at the rubber boot at the driveshaft tube. It should just be starting to slide. Watch the boot for any pinching.  Use the scissor jack under the oil pan to make tilting adjustments. The engine needs to go forward and as high as possible to clear the frame. To do this, lift up with the hoist and pull the bike back. The kickstand should slide on the floor. As you do, the spline connecting the output shaft from the motor to the universal joint should slide off. Look inside the rubber boot to make sure it has cleared before proceeding.    Once the engine is in position, block it up and slide the bike sideways (left). When the strap on the left side of the head slides under spine of the frame, disconnect the rope and reattach to the strap, passing it under the right side of the spine. Pull the motor up a bit, continue sliding the bike to the left and the engine slips out. No strain, no pain and if your careful, not a scratch on the frame.

[[Image:lt_logo.jpg]]

LiveType is text creator in the following paragraphs the basics of this program will be explained. Start out by typing in the Inspector window in the upper left hand box.  After typing in a word, it appears on the Canvas. The Blue Bar under the text moves the text around, or by just clicking on a letter that letter will move by itself. The start and end points on blue bar moves the text vertically. A person can create a control point on the blue bar to skew the text by holding down control then click on the blue bar and choose ‘add control point’. To curve the text hold control then click on the control point and choose add a curve point. Attributes and text settings are similar to that in Photoshop. 
There is two different font types Regular and LiveFonts. In the media browser window on the far right choose the font tab and choose a font and click apply to change it. To style the regular font a viewer can go back to the inspector window and change the text in any way that they wish with attributes, effects, style and text. Under the style tab there are four ways to style the text shadow, outline, glow and extrude. LiveFonts are pre made animated texts that a user can choose from in the media browser under Livefonts. To change the color of the Livefont the user can simply go to attributes in the inspector window and change the color where it says color. 
	
The texture tab in the media browser allows the user to put an animated background to the text. When adding textures the texture gets put onto the timeline below the separated bar, this is so that the user can choose whether or not they want to include it in final render. The viewer can drag the background on the timeline above the separation bar and that would make the background automatically render out in final output with the text. The timeline in LiveType isn’t like a normal editing system timeline.  This is because when an animated text or background is dragged out or shortened it makes it faster and longer in speed. In the inspector window under the tab timing it displays the speed of the layer and the user can notice as they shorten or lengthen the speed changes. But, this doesn’t apply to anything static. The user can also slide the layer up and down the timeline horizontally to make it appear earlier or later in the animation. One very good feature about LifeType is that the preset textures can loop seamlessly. Another cool feature about LiveFont is that it can have multiple projects open at a time and be able to switch between them with tabs right above the timeline. The user can also hold down control and click on a track to copy and then paste it on another project.  One more handy feature is that the user can hold down control and click on a track and choose reveal media browser to find the original source of that track quickly. Some really good free tutorials on LiveType can be found at:

*Always qualify objects by owner.=
*Use query &quot;with (nolock)&quot; when you don't require high transactional consistency.
*Do not use GOTO.
*Avoid cursor use.  If necessary, always declare the correct type of cursor (FAST_FORWARD).
*Avoid SELECT INTO for populating temp tables.  Create the table then use INSERT SELECT.
*Always use ANSI join syntax.
*Always check for object existance.
*Use SCOPE_IDENTITY() instead of @@IDENTITY.
*Always check @@TRANCOUNT and commit/rollback as necessary.
*Order DML to avoid deadlocks.
*Always check @@ERROR and @@ROWCOUNT by assigning to a variable.
*Always check sp return values.
*Do not create cross-database dependencies.
*Avoid table value UDF – performance problems.
*Avoid dynamic SQL – if necessary use sp_executesql over EXEC.
*Avoid using NULL values.
*When there are only two values, ISNULL is more efficient than COALESCE.
*Always specify columns; try to avoid &quot;SELECT *&quot;. Exceptions include these two cases: &quot;WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * ...)&quot; and aggregate functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Synopsis ==

The synopsis of chapter 2 is very short, but that's really because very little actually happens. Harry's scar hurts; he thinks about who he could talk to about it; and finally he decides to write a letter to Sirius, writes the letter, and sets it aside. End of chapter. Most of the chapter really is re-introducing us to Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and the Dursleys, and to a lesser extent Sirius and Hedwig.</text>

# This proposal is definitely a step toward a good direction: it defines textbooks, deals with computer games and omissions. But it lacks clear rules what texts should go to Wikisource (we don't need 100-years-old outdated books here), explicit prohibition of self-promotion and propaganda (it mentions products etc. but not religious beliefs and political opinions). It does not deal with self-censorship as the old one did. I also fear that after mentioning Wikiversity so many times, people will start writing &quot;courses&quot; there being in fact our textbooks. I'm not against the direction of changes in the policy, but I think that in current shape it's still not ready. Also, with so many votes against, there is no consensus to introduce it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:23, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

* I have voted oppose as I believe that video game guides would be valuable to the project and help generate further interest in Wikibooks.  People claim that we 'were told' to remove guides but surely such a decision rests with those who are part of the project and not from high above.  Plus the list of what's OK for Wikibooks is not exclusive which may cause problems later when someone creates a new book (for example a textbook on rolling joints, or making a nuclear bomb) and finds that it's later nominated for deletion.[[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 01:36, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
::I support the view that removing content without a stated limitation of space, and proper data that permits to generates an analysis of quality of the content and interest by Wikibookians, should be objected by default, more content doesn't directly relate to more users/readers but less will certainly contribute to diminishing interest.
::There are other problems on this particular &quot;vote&quot;, it should have been made more publicly known that it was running, the considerations about the limitation or restriction to the enforcement of the text hasn't been taken in account and it is present on the discussion page, from that I don't think a presumed consensus could be asserted.
::As for the text proposed, it has indeed improved but there isn't a need to directly mention the GFDL (as recent posts on the staff lounge indicated) there may be a need to add more licenses in the future a simple reference to the [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]] would have sufficed and facilitate evolution on that subject in the future.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:56, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:::We never delete materials because of space concerns, we delete things that are against policy and need to be deleted. 
:::This vote is not properly advertised, but a discussion of this magnitude will likely be open for a long time, so we dont need to worry right now that people can't find it. It will get more public as time goes on. Also, no consensus is being &quot;asserted&quot;, that's why we are putting it to a vote. 
:::It is unlikely that we will ever alter the license here, even if people talk about it on staff lounge. And if we do make such a major change in the future, it is likely that this and many other policy documents will need to be rewritten entirely. I don't see mention of the GFDL as being a good reason to oppose a policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:03, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::I can think of a dozen good reasons why we shouldnt have videogame guides here, and none of them have to do with the fact that Jimbo said we shouldnt have them. We shouldnt make a decision based on our personal dislike of outside authority, but instead based on what is best for the project. Videogame guides technically shouldnt have been allowed under the previous version of the WIW policy, and the ambiguity on that matter has caused many problems. Fact is that most of the videogame guides have already left of their own volition, and the few new guides that are uploaded here are quickly abandoned. Fighting to keep videogame guides here is useless because there aren't many here left to keep. We might as well just cut out the ambiguity and prevent further confusion. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:59, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::I also see no reason to include Videogame guides.  Perhaps another wiki at another time, but as for now, I agree with Whiteknight.--[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 14:51, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

: People seem to have a problem with both trying to be exclusive and and not being exclusive. People who don't like the exclusive approach raise concern about potential abuse by admins to mass delete anything thats not on the list without any regard to VfD and people who want it to be exclusive point out problems with people adding things which might get deleted later. WIW is never going to be perfect or satisfy everyone. WIW states both 1) that to be on Wikibooks it needs to be able to pass consensus to remain and 2) Omissions are not a reason to justify keeping or deleting books. Surely in its current form any omissions from the policy proposal can be quickly addressed once agreed on, if passed in its current form. If people don't want something to be on Wikibooks its not going to pass VfD and this proposed policy is simply saying it can't be used to justify keeping it. Any book can be nominated for deletion, its up to the community to decide what to keep or delete. What reasons do you think this policy must be exclusive and how does that benefit anyone? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:41, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:It's my understanding that the two words are being used for the same concept, but represent different grammatical uses. A common example of the difference is somebody asking &quot;can i go to the bathroom&quot;, to which the common reply is &quot;I dont know, can you?&quot; &quot;can&quot; represents the ability to do something, and &quot;may&quot; represents having permission to do something. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:38, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
::In which case, &quot;can&quot; speaks to a general state of capacity and &quot;may&quot; speaks to a level of permission. So the items with &quot;can&quot; are attempts at general descriptions of what textbooks (as rather uniquely defined by wikibooks) &quot;are&quot; and the two using &quot;may&quot; speak to what textbook authors are and are not allowed to include? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:38, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
:::Although American (at the least) grammar has made the words interchangeable when they are not, &quot;can&quot; is really the ''ability'' to do things. Since anyone can edit this wiki, &quot;can&quot; is inappropriate by how I see it. The WIW list is for permissions. I suggest we make a quick fix to rename all the &quot;can&quot; to &quot;may&quot; and unbold the terms as well since I don't see the point. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 14:54, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

=== &quot;Expensive Proprietary Textbooks&quot; ===
I voted Support, but I don't think &quot;We hope this provides a better alternative to expensive proprietary textbooks.&quot; in the first paragraph should be included.  It just doesn't serve a real purpose... In addition, ''we'' is used nowhere else in the document.  It shouldn't be included.  --[[User:Jimmyatic|Jimmyatic]] 14:51, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:&quot;it is hoped that...&quot; is excellent!  But for me, I still believe the &quot;expensive proprietary&quot; in &quot;It is hoped that this provides a better alterntive to ''expensive proprietary textbooks'' is too much.  Is there any way to change it to be a bit more friendly?

::I certainly see your criticism, and I do agree with you that this sentence is out of place.

===Missing some of the old &quot;Wikibooks is Not&quot; - Send people to strategy Wiki?===
* I like most of the changes that have occurred, its certainly much more condensed than it was before, and I think easier to read. Noticably, some of the points about what wikibooks is not (such as, it is not the place to do development, it is not censored, and it is not a soapbox) have been removed, but I'm not sure if they were necessary based on the history of activities here. If we see someone doing the former, we can easily just point them to meta as the right place to go, I'm not sure if the latter should be in policy or not because we don't want this to become myspace once it has shown more growth in readership and contributors, but if there are adequate decision making policies in place (that's another one that'll be worked on once we come to a decision on this one) this shouldn't hopefully be a problem. 

* Other than that, I think the policies themselves as they are are make sense, maybe we should mention strategy wiki as an alternative place for VG strategy guides? The way I see it, VG guides are un-contestably allowed there, so why not encourage people to develop them where there will not be controversy over its appropriateness for the project, rather than here where there has been a significant amount of it? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 15:28, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:* IMO the not censored bit I think is more appropriate for [[Wikibooks:General disclaimer]]. If you look at the key points of the soapbox section they were covering NPOV, essays and advertisements/self-promotions which are covered in this proposal as ''Maintain a neutral point of view'', ''Not actively promote or advertise products, services or companies'', ''not essays, or for planning a class curriculum or online learning course'' and a few other things. The development bit I think may be covered by ''Wikibooks focuses on textbooks'' text which also includes ''Our sister project Media-Wiki has a place for proposing new Wikimedia projects if you cannot find a wiki for what you want to do''. So it already points people to Wikimedia for proposing new projects. So hopefully I've addressed your concerns.
:* I don't think suggesting StategyWiki as a place to post VG strategy guides should be a problem. I'll add it. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:29, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Travel guides ===

*Can we get some agreement as to the use of Wikibooks for storing travel guides? Discussion here: [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Isle of Arran|1]] and [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/London|2]] this could be a growth area. [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] 16:43, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
**I think that's another can of worms that we really shouldnt be opening right now. This proposal states that ommissions from it's text cannot be used as a justification to keep or delete materials. In other words, anything that isn't stated specifically is not to be implied from the text. Travel guides are not explicitly mentioned here, which means that it is up to the judgement of Wikibookians to determine whether they belong here on a case-by-case basis. Of note, Wikitravel is an excellent place for hosting travel guides, and if the controversy here surrounding them is too great, i would suggest authors could try moving them to that other site. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:59, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Policy vs. Guideline ===
::I will agree into making this a guideline (the actual version, not the proposed), since the enforcement of this text is not needed (as it doesn't indeed define nothing, it provides guidelines on acceptable content), this is further reinforced with the declaration &quot;Omissions should not be used to justify keeping or deleting pages or books.&quot;, I think no one that has opposed this as a policy will object making it a guideline.
::Can anyone point out what if not to block the creation of non compliant material will be the purpose of making this a policy?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:47, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:::This page is a foundation piece for our entire project, and will have a dramatic effect on future operations here. Making this a guideline simply shouldn't be an option, and I wont agree to it at all. This policy '''is enforceable''' because it defines things that are not acceptable to be here. This policy can be used as justification to delete things as per our deletion policy, especially in discussions at VfD. The fact that omissions to the policy cannot be used as deletion justification does not mean that the policy itself cannot be invoked to justify any deletions. It only means that things that are not specifically specified are not implied. There are several things in that proposal that are specifically mentioned, however. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:56, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::::Ok &quot;This policy can be used as justification to delete things as per our deletion policy&quot; that is why I will not support it, what if a VfD goes against (or seems) one of the definitions on this text.

::::: As a policy this proposal would allow VfD to supersede any &quot;static&quot; definition given through being able to pass community consensus.

::::::Yes the enforceable section is very disarming (txs for making it more readable), that is why I don't understand why to push it to be a policy in the first place, it really says it doesn't define anything and does nothing, it's just a bunch of guidelines on what should or not be here on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:40, 13 April 2007 (UTC)   

::::::Wikibookians are not robots, they are allowed to make decisions in just about all matters. Many sections of this policy are intentionally left vague to preserve the power wikibookians have to make decisions on these kinds of matters. Furthermore, in VfD, admins may use judgement as to whether to delete or not delete a page, and that judgement is based in large part off this policy, and the arguments that wikibookians make concerning this policy. There are real tangible effects from this proposal, and making it a guideline will only encourage people to be more loose in their interpretation, and more willing to disobey it all together. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:49, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:::::::Guidelines aren't open to be disobeyed without a good reason, and this shouldn't be a policy that enforces personal judgments, because they are personal and may not reflect the spirit or the intention of what is written down, in this case the text has no written enforceability (teeth), it goes as far as to state that it does nothing than provide a guideline of what content is acceptable or not.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:06, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

::::::::Yes, without a good reason. But when it comes down to it, everybody treats the deletion of their work as a &quot;good reason&quot;. It has written enforceability, it is enforceable through the deletion policy, which it expressly mentions. WIW discusses ''what'' to delete, the deletion policy discusses ''how'' to delete it. The two work together, and are very enforceable. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:17, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:::::::::That was my point if it is enforced by another policy why does it need to be a policy? What you seem to be atempting to state is that it defines or gives guidelines to the implementation of another policy, so it should be a guideline, what makes you think that by doing that we are degrading its intentions. I expect you are not assuming bad faith from users (&quot;only encourage people to be more loose in their interpretation, and more willing to disobey it all together&quot;), apart from that I don't see any other point on making it a policy and see benefits in making as lose as possible to permit evolution and new formats to appear and be chalanged.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:35, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Major changes without discussion prior to vote ===

* The latest changes since the last comment on the talk page are so numerous and has so completely gutted the previous policy that I can't possibly support this change.  This was not simplification, and I am actually shocked that not even a simple comment like &quot;I've cleaned this up for clarity&quot; was even put in the edit history.  For such a major change [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks/Unstable&amp;oldid=813769 from this version] has not even had so much as a minor comment.  I would consider the diff beteween this version I noted and the one under proposal to be huge, and certainly has not achieved any sort of concensus.  I also strongly disagree with the ultra strong tone of &quot;Wikibooks is only for textbooks&quot; that seems to come across.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 22:24, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
** Excuse me for asking for some clarification here, but are you saying that people should vote against this policy (or at least that you are voting against it) because it's a big change from a previous version of the proposal, and because the edit summary isn't satisfactory? This page represents a straw poll to gauge the level of consensus, it doesnt make sense to me that we should have to acquire consensus on the policy talk page, and then require it again here. If that is your position, then I say we should delete this page completely, and simply get consensus once on the module talk page. As to your last objection, there is certainly a strong &quot;Wikibooks is only for textbooks&quot;, but this proposal is intentionally vague in specifying what precisely a &quot;textbook&quot; is. For comparison, the current version of this policy also states unambiguously &quot;this is for textbooks&quot;, but makes no attempt to define what a &quot;textbook&quot; is in terms of our project. So it's my opinion that the fact that &quot;Wikibooks is for textbooks&quot; is not being changed with this revision, but that an effort has been made to define what a &quot;textbook&quot; is. Notice that under the current vague definition many different types of educational resources do qualify as being &quot;textbooks&quot; for inclusion here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:49, 15 April 2007 (UTC)
*** To clarify here, I felt that we were making some significant progress on this policy before the major changes were made.  I also don't think this is a mere straw poll to gague concensus but rather a ratification of a major policy.  As with nearly any heavily edited page on any Wikimedia website or even any Wiki at all, if you make a substantial change I feel it is incumbent that the person who made the changes should offer reasons why the changes were done.  I didn't see this happen here, certainly not to the degree I'm accustom to on Wikipedia or even to pages I've been involved with here on Wikibooks.  And to move this to become the &quot;official, enfoced policy of Wikibooks&quot; when such changes occur presuming that no futher debate can occur to change the policy is where I think this has gone too far.  Sure, once this vote happens it can still be changed, but it will develop its own inerta resisting any real substantive change of this order.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:08, 22 April 2007 (UTC)
** If I understand correctly your opposed because the edit summary didn't include a simple comment on what was done. As can be seen [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable|diff=815163&amp;oldid=813769}} here], its simply not true. While I did not say &quot;I've cleaned this up for clarity&quot;, I did summarize what I had done and I disagree that the result was a huge change. The points are the same, except for the absents of a disclaimer which was replaced with a link to the content disclaimer. I agree with Whiteknight, that it doesn't make sense to have to acquire consensus twice. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:01, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

::* I may be mistaken, but I thought that the point of the unstable branch was to propose changes without reaching consensus, and without changing the currently-active policy. I agree that it is the point of this vote to secure consensus, and though the talk page can and should be used to get peoples' opinions as far as how the policy is coming along, but I do not think we should discount the vote simply because editors did not leave a message every time they changed something. 

::* With that said, I will ask you: what do you think of the policy in its current state? [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 13:51, 17 April 2007 (UTC)
::*: I don't mind it so much, but I did raise several objections that key points were missing from this proposed policy that were in the previous version(s) of this policy, and were IMHO important enough not to be omitted simply due to simplification.  I felt that a rough compromise was made that preserved some positive language, but this current version represents a major change from that previous compromised version.  I'm not objecting to discounting changes without comment, but to make these kind of changes and move this policy to enforced status immediately after those changes are made is where I am objecting.  I just don't think this version has had the same level of previous review and compromise that earlier versions of this policy, even in the unstable branch, had achieved and it was premature to bring this to a vote in such a condition.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 07:08, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

* I would also like to express that I dislike what I perceive to be a textbooks-only policy and further and, further, that I do not like the plethora of inclusion-related policies that we are now getting.  If we are going to have [[Wikibooks:Annotated texts]], then we logically have [[Wikibooks:Textbooks]]; both would entail what type of texts are permitted on Wikibooks; I, however, would like to see an inclusion policy written that includes all items of consideration in one text and is less textbooks-only.  --[[User talk:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 23:04, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Textbook definition ===

Regretfully Oppose. The definition of &quot;textbook&quot; is too idiosyncratic and arbitrary. &quot;Textbook - A formal manual of instruction in a specific subject, especially one for use in schools or colleges.&quot; --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:30, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

To explain this a little better, there is a section entitled &quot;What are textbooks&quot; this is followed by a set of bullet points. These points describe wikibooks but they are not a good description of textbooks. Take the bullet point &quot;Textbooks are not mirrors for contents on another website.&quot; If this phrase is taken out of context it is a non-sequitur of gigantic proportions, on the order of &quot;Apples are not golf courses on the beach.&quot; Well of course they are not. But looking at it a little deeper one finds that textbooks *can be* mirrors of other web content. In fact, the purpose of the GFDL is to allow &quot;mirrors&quot; of our content in various forms. Take &quot;Textbooks may be printable or have printable versions, but textbooks are not paper, limited in size, intended to remain static or be restricted in any way.&quot; In real life, textbooks can be (and most real textbooks are) restricted in many ways. Even the books we write here are heavily restricted judging by this document and the results of VfDs. Also clearly most textbooks '''are''' paper. I would like to avoid saying things that are generally not true in our policies and guidelines. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:07, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

:Not to be silly, but that's something I find frustrating about the name of our project. This is '''W'''ikibooks. We write '''w'''ikibooks. So it gets difficult to talk about what ''a'' wikibook is in the plural. Maybe switch to &quot;''A Wikibook'' is not paper&quot;, to sort of clarify what we're talking about?
:In a very general sense, I've been keeping a distance from this change of WIW, because (as I've said in many places), it just seems a bit overambitious. The repeated deadlocks remind me of the way the US congress makes those odd, very large bills, rather than passing small items (we need some pork to spread around, eh?). If we're going to redo the whole thing, why not do it charter-style, where we just approve a very simple version, then add or subtract materials in a line-item fashion? This is how it's done on [[w:WP:NOT]], and by doing it line-item style, the policy has been kept stable over time, while allowing changes to be made when the need arises. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:17, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

:In response to Xixtas, I would like to point out that we are not attempting to repeat any previous definition of the word &quot;textbook&quot;, but we are instead redefining that word for our personal use here.  The things that we make here are obviously not traditional &quot;textbooks&quot;, although there are several connotations of that word that we would like to adopt for our use here (while changing many of the specific points). We could use a confusing term like &quot;Wikibooks is for wikibooks&quot; or something equally rediculous, but that would then require a section to define what precisely a &quot;wikibook&quot; is. We could say that &quot;Wikibooks is for apples&quot;, and then go on to say that &quot;an apple is an instructional resource for learning&quot;. Wikibooks simply aren't traditional textbooks, but at the same time there is no other word that would be better adopted for our purpose. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:49, 15 April 2007 (UTC)

::Any arbitrary word that we choose is going to come with problems.

I went through and changed the parts that really bothered me regarding the defining of &quot;Textbook&quot; but tried to stay true to the spirit and what I believe was the intended meaning of the original.

:I have read your edits and I like them. I agree with you that there is certainly some confusion stemming from semantics and that it's not entirely clear that we are redefining the word &quot;textbook&quot;. I did not see anything in your rewording that struck me as deviating from the intent or spirit of this proposal at all. However, if we rewrote the policy now it would essentially invalidate the current vote and cause us all to start over from square one. I am in the minority here in that I have a much greater sense of urgency to pass this proposal then most people do. I feel that this proposal corrects many of the ambiguities of the previous version, and would be a great boon to our project as we try to move forward. If I may be so bold as to suggest such a thing, might I ask that we save these changes and criticisms for after this policy has been accepted? Changes to the wording and grammar of an accepted policy dont require the lengthy political discussions that the acceptance of an entirely new proposal do. Once the proposal is made official, clarifications are as easy as making the changes and hoping nobody complains. Clarifications and changes in semantics can become the first order of business after we get the hard part (community approval of the policy) out of the way. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:06, 16 April 2007 (UTC)

Eg, paper is limited in size, is static and have other restrictions that textbooks here do not necessarily share.

=== Summary and why I at the moment will not change my vote ===
I was thinking on changing my vote since the ground I most object to the text now is the rational that was expressed on making it a policy, but I found that there are other points to still object to.
#&quot;Textbooks are not mirrors for contents on another website.&quot;, this statement is incorrect or at least badly stated  if I take the meaning as for what it intends expressing.
#I'm still not comfortable in why make it a policy and not a guideline the text only have 3 lines of NOTs and even those can be a bit vague for instance &quot;other literary works&quot;, and the somewhat problematic list of musts.  The reason given to make it a policy seem only based on assuming bad intention from users that will lead to directly challenge the text if it is a guideline, I take this as a working in reverse of assuming god faith, or at most an express intent to block or kill content that doesn't conform with text before it is created (in doubt don't do it), I think this shouldn't be the way we look at this text that is indeed a guideline (as it clearly has no enforcement power) or a specific definition to be used and enforced on by another policy.
#&quot;Be released under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License.&quot;, again the devil is on the details, this statement is incomplete (not to say in error) because Wikibooks license in not simply the GFDL but GFDL with some limitations, or put in another way not all GFDL content can be used on Wikibooks. The link is correct as it direct the user to the copyright page but the textual information induces in error (this may not be only a problem with this text but should be corrected if possible).
#&quot;textbook content &lt;u&gt;must&lt;/u&gt;&quot;... &quot;Be accurate, verifiable, peer reviewable and have a distinct book definition.&quot;, this will place all current books without a book definition in violation of policy, more it can even generate conflict, for instance the first &quot;scope or book definition&quot; created for the C++ Programming book was created by an outside (non contributor to the book) administrator, without any regard to the book editors, more it may be seen as a way to limit or shape book evolution of enforce and empower a battle over it (the reason of my fork of the C++ was also based on such divergence on the evolution of the work), I envision editors without previous contact with works start to Be Bold and with good intention engage in the activity of providing every book the missing definition.  What to do when the content is against the definitions or vice versa.
#must &quot;Be more than a collection of articles or list of terms, quotations, facts, images or other pieces of information.&quot;, to generic and without enforcing the need to consider a book at any stage as unfinished, this will not only invalidate a book in project but also create problems to slow editors.
#must &quot;Not cover more than one subject (although limited off-topic content should be tolerated if it increases the effectiveness of the textbook).&quot;, to generic, can a book be about flowers or only a specific type of lower, can a book cover multiple CPUs, Programming languages etc... In specific can't the C++ Programming book address Programming Patters ?
#must &quot;Not violate official Wikibooks policies or ignore official guidelines without a good reason.&quot;, is there any reason to the existence of this line ?
I call your attention that policies can't be broken, stating MUST is stating an unbreakable obligation, there are no good justification to break policy...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:59, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

:As is my typical style, I will try to address this in a point-by-point manner.
:#Wikibooks is about the creation of new material, not about the collection of existing material. It is fine to move some GFDL material here, but technically that is not our goal here. Mirroring content implies holding a static copy of materials, when in fact materials on our project are open to be edited and modified. This might be vague, but is not incorrect.
:#&quot;Literary&quot; has two meanings, and the meaning most commonly intended from that particular usage is &quot;[[wikt:Literature|The collected stories of a nation, people group or culture]]&quot;. It is intended to mean works of fiction, although again there are some ambiguities. The intending meaning of it, and the spirit of it, is not incorrect.  Also, it's not a matter of bad faith, it's a matter of finality. We want to be able to say, in a pinch, that X either does belong or does not belong. Opening up to say that there are possible reasons where the policy ''may be broken'', even with good reason, will allow things to be here that dont belong.
:#A minor omission, and one that can be easily and quickly corrected once the voting is over.
:#It does not say that the definition needs to be explicit. But, half your book can't be written about algebra for teenagers, and the other half of your book written about dogs for senior citizens. The C++ book, for instance, is consistant, and a scope is implied.
:#There is strong VfD precedent not to delete books that fail this criteria, so long as there is a possibility of improvement. There is a difference between a book that is temporarily a macropedia until it is finished, and a book that is intended to be a macropedia.
:#Again, dogs and algebra. Writing a book about &quot;flowers&quot; is different from writing a book about &quot;Roses and petunias&quot;, or even &quot;Trees and Flowers&quot;.
:#Is there any reason against it? Consider the [[White Heritage Security]] book (long since deleted), that technically didn't violate WIW, but was still a policy violation. Because it was a violation, it was deleted. 
:Many of the points that you bring up are matters of clarifications or rewordings. We can't change the version of the policy being voted on now, because changing it will invalidate the vote. However, making small changes in wording after the policy has been accepted will be much easier, especially if the changes represent an improvement in clarity. I would ask you to vote now on the &quot;spirit&quot; of the policy, and we can make fixing the particular words a primary concern after the voting is over. What we should do is make a list of small changes that need to be made, so that we can go through and make them at the end. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:19, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Existing policy is far better ===
Can you explain more what you mean? Whats unclear, incomprehensive and inaccurate about this proposed policy? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:42, 19 April 2007 (UTC)

*The existing policy includes quite a few specific statements that are only obliquely stated, if they are even stated at all, by this poor proposed replacement.  One example is &quot;Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider.&quot;.  These clear titles are necessary.  Without them, the policy is at best unclear, and indeed wholly inaccurate where it actually omits them entirely.  It should be noted that most of the &quot;What this project is not&quot; policies of the various Wikimedia Foundation projects are phrased in the way that the existing policy is.  (&quot;X is not a news service.&quot;  &quot;X is not an encyclopaedia.&quot;,  &quot;X is not a free web space provider.&quot; and so forth.)  To diverge from that common standard so acutely, as this poor replacement proposes to do, only serves to confuse people coming from other projects.

: Have you seen [[n:Wikinews:What is Wikinews|Wikinews:What Wikinews is]] or [[w:Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]]? They both use lists rather then titles. I disagree that it diverges from some common standard, that there even is a common standard, that titles are necessary, and that using a list instead of titles makes the proposal unclear or wholly inaccurate. I don't believe &quot;Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider&quot; is necessary in this proposal because it contains &quot;Pages that do not aid in the creation of textbooks do not belong here&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:09, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

I disagree entirely, the old version doesnt even describe what a &quot;textbook&quot; is, which I consider to be a very important (critically important) omission. This version also includes more examples of things which do and do not belong. In short, this version answers all the questions that the old version ignored. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:28, 19 April 2007 (UTC)

*The current policy links to [[w:textbook]] for a definition of what a textbook is, and the statement that are are more examples is simply false.  (There are ''fewer'' examples, and the text is ''less'' detailed.  The proposal omits mention of WikiSaurus, for example, and does not contain several of the points made in the existing policy about annotated texts.)  If that is the rationale underpinning the attempted wholesale removal of entire swathes of the existing policy, as is being done here, then it is a bad one. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 11:11, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
**Annotated texts already comprise a separate policy, and attempting to discuss that subject at length in two places gives rise to policy contradictions which should be avoided. Also, the way we are using the word &quot;textbook&quot; is not traditional, and is not adequately covered by the linked wikipedia article. It is in our best interest to redefine the word as we need to be more accurate, and not foster the confusion that comes from trying to combine our books and traditional printed books into the same small category. We don't mention tons of other wikis either such as wikispecies, wikinews, or wikiquote. We do say that wikibooks is not a thesaurus, so maybe we could include a link to wikisaurus if that's a big sticking point for you. the &quot;wholesale removal of entire swathes of the existing policy&quot; should be encouraged, where those swathes are redundant or rambling. There are many sections of the existing policy that aren't even related to the &quot;what wikibooks is&quot; subject. The new proposal is more concise, presents the same necessary information with less verbage and less confusion; it omits the things that were worth omitting, and includes only the things that are worth including. Furthermore, much of the information that you think we are losing is being shuffled into other policies or guideline documents instead. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:52, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

: [[WB:AT|Annotated texts]] has its own enforced policy now, there is no need to repeat it here, a link to it is provided within this proposal instead. WikiSaurus is part of Wiktionary, I don't think that a specific mention of it is necessary, but I don't think its addition would a major change either. What things are omitted? I agree with Whiteknight that this proposal does a better job answering questions that the old version did not. Linking to the traditional definition of textbook is not helpful, because textbooks on Wikibooks hardly fit the tradition definition or mold of the word. By providing a definition within the proposal it provides clarification on what textbooks are to Wikibooks and helps to emphasize the mission of Wikibooks better. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:09, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

:: I'm not sure I agree with this, it seems that there's a lot less discussion around here until someone proposes a vote, then all of a sudden all of the opinions come out [or if they had come out, they were in an out of the way place such as a user talk page that perhaps not everyone would read, or deep in some archive]. Without knowing such opinions it is impossible to achieve a consensus. Perhaps the vote shouldn't be used to decide to accept or reject the policy, but simply as a gauge of how everyone thinks it is going, once the discussion has stagnated (as Rob pointed out, the discussion on this particular policy had, for whatever reason, halted despite continued changes, and it took a vote to get out peoples' criticism of the changes). I will agree though that a vote can often throw a lot at us at once rather than focusing on getting consensus of one thing at a time, but whether you want that or not depends on if you like to look at things as a whole or in parts, and I think everyone's different in ''that'' regard.

===My objections to the proposed policy  ===
I dislike the inclusion of the one subject rule. It is vague and/or overly inclusive. Under this rule could a book on say Criminal Justice include a chapter on US Law? If no, why not? Any other CRJ textbook would. If it can then the rule is vague enough to imply that it can not.
I also found the book definition part as written to be  vague and I do not see the point. --[[User:Cspurrier|Cspurrier]] 21:36, 21 April 2007 (UTC)

If we're going to have a policy then we must be very clear about what the rules are.  If we continue to be vague about details then there's no point in having the policy.

::While the page is named &quot;vote&quot;, I dont think that this really has anything to do with a normal democratic vote. [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] is clear that these kinds of matters are never decided by a &quot;majority vote&quot;. That guideline also is clear that consensus can be measured with a straw poll. People who oppose the vote are heavily encouraged to discuss their objections here, and it is on the strength of those objections and following rebuttals that the matter will be finally decided. If anything, the &quot;votes&quot; above are little more then markers for the comments listed below.
::As to the one-subject rule that you are discussing, the intent was that books that are clearly on two distinct subjects should be split into two books to better cover both subjects. A book on criminal justice is expected to have chapters about law, but also possibly other subjects such a forensics, psychology, etc. All of these subjects would be unified along a particular narrative, however. For instance, we don't want a CRJ book with a chapter on &quot;computer and printer maintenance&quot; because criminal investigators typically need to repair their own computers. We also don't want a book with &quot;Criminal Justice and Dog Care&quot;, even if K-9 units are integral parts of some criminal investigations. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:12, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Step in the right direction, but lacks clear rules ===

This proposal is definitely a step toward a good direction: it defines textbooks, deals with computer games and omissions. But it lacks clear rules what texts should go to Wikisource (we don't need 100-years-old outdated books here), explicit prohibition of self-promotion and propaganda (it mentions products etc. but not religious beliefs and political opinions). It does not deal with self-censorship as the old one did. I also fear that after mentioning Wikiversity so many times, people will start writing &quot;courses&quot; there being in fact our textbooks. I'm not against the direction of changes in the policy, but I think that in current shape it's still not ready. Also, with so many votes against, there is no consensus to introduce it. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:23, 4 May 2007 (UTC)

: There is a [[WB:AT|Annotated texts]] policy now, which is linked to from within WIW/Unstable, which covers the issue of what texts should goto Wikisource. Religious beliefs and political opinions are covered by the [[WB:NPOV|neutral point of view]] policy, which is mentioned within WIW/Unstable as &quot;Maintain a neutral point of view&quot;. I believe &quot;Be considered acceptable through community consensus when there is a dispute as to its appropriateness&quot; covers self-censorship as does the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] policy which is linked to from within WIW/Unstable. I also believe one of the disclaimers pages, such as the General Disclaimer, is a better place to cover the issue in more detail. I disagree there is no consensus to introduce it, there are more people in favor then opposed and there has been very little in the way of rebuttals when someone has responded to the reasons for opposing the proposal.

It seems to me that this policy has failed to reach consensus. Therefore, I would like to ask what you all feel the next step should be in reaching an acceptable compromise.

If willing, I think at this point people should make and discuss their own edits as well, and hopefully we'll arrive at something acceptable.

:I know this might be a depressing suggestion to those who have been working so hard on this, but maybe just make a minor change to the policy by adding a single line: &quot;This policy may be changed incrementally by the addition, subtraction, or modification of particular points, each point to be decided upon separately.&quot; Then we could just pass minor amendments when we feel the need, rather than having to rewrite it every time. I think this would be advantageous for 2 reasons: first, because it will let us move through those changes that we already agree upon anyway, and second, I ''strongly'' believe that horse trading, poison pills, and &quot;pork&quot; just don't belong in a consensus-driven &quot;society&quot; such as ours... we can leave that to the republics and the democracies. &quot;What is Wikibooks&quot; should contain only and all of those policies that we all consent to. It's not about compromise or trading this for that. It's about coming to agreements, or in some cases coming to see one's view as contrary to that of the community, and agreeing to disagree. Changing things a bit at a time is much better for us. --[[User:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SB_Johnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:48, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

:: Do you mean start back at square one? Its a possibility, to do that and then pass amendments to that until it is up to snuff instead of starting with the rewrite and trying to modify that, not sure which method would be better though. If we do take your suggestion then I'm sure there are ''some'' things that the community can agree should / can be change. I have to agree with Robert's earlier point that many of the changes were done without discussing until now we have a completely different policy and never really ironed out the details, and therefore if we start again from scratch (or some pre-agreed midpoint) we'd have to make sure we remember that mistake.

:There are a few issues with the current policy, we wouldn't have attempted a complete (and controversial) rewrite if the current policy was perfect. That said, Wikibooks is at somewhat of a disadvantage compared with other wikimedia projects. Wikipedia had Jimbo, and later the WMF to help guide it. In many occasions, the correct direction for wikipedia to take was mandated from above. Other newer projects, such as wikiversity had their missions and charters determined ''before they were even created'', so that those projects start off with no ambiguity as to their goals or the types of acceptable content. Wikibooks doesnt have either of these things, and so we are on our own to find our own path.
:I only say this because i want to point out that we do have a harder time, but I also want to stress that progress isn't futile. We can't rely on external influence, so we do need to rely on each other. Numerically, if you look at the votes you can say that the majority of people are in favor of this proposal. However, because we are a community, and because we only have each other to rely on, a simple voters majority simply can't be made into policy; especially not a policy that is so important.
:I do agree with Johnny, we need to take this in baby steps. However &quot;baby steps&quot; does not mean that progress will not be made, or that it must be made painfully slow. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 17:58, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

::Babies can get around alarmingly quickly (from a parents' point of view)! Perhaps change the &quot;amendments amendment&quot; to read:
::*''&quot;This policy may be changed incrementally by the addition, subtraction, or modification of particular points, each point to be decided upon separately. Such calls for consensus should be announced using [[Mediawiki:watchdetails]] (thus making it appear on all registered users' watchlists), and if there are no major disagreements these changes will be put into place 2 weeks after the call for consensus.&quot;''

:::I dont know necessarily that every little change needs to be announced on [[Mediawiki:Watchdetails]]. Also, non-admins can't even edit that page, so essentially non-admins wouldn't be able to propose new ammendments. I think it's a better idea for people to add [[Wikibooks talk:What is Wikibooks]] to their watchlist and propose all changes there, '''or''' we could propose all changes at the [[WB:SLP|Project staff lounge page]], which most people should already have on their watchlists. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 19:09, 10 May 2007 (UTC)

:::::Proper way to go about it is the proposer to declare the proposal as closed and state the status of the discussion on the date it closed (for future reference).

: It was previously protected against editing to maintain stability while it was being considered, it no longer is protected.

Would really like enough direction to be able to prepare this at home. 02:55, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:I've wikilinked the spices, if that was what was troubling you. The directions are exactly as simple as they look - mix the spices together, push through a sieve, and store in a jar for later use. Are you perhaps looking for a recipe that uses this spice mix? One such recipe is [[Cookbook:Butter chicken|butter chicken]], a very popular dish in North Indian restaurants in Australia. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:09, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

==Food Colouring==
I have removed the food colouring as it is not a part of the traditional recipe. This food coloring is used by roadside stalls and cheap restaurants who do not put enough or none of the costlier ingridients(some dont know all the ingredients) and they make up for it by adding colour.
Morover food colouring is a spurious way of cooking(atleast in this recipe because it is not needed).
The colour that is widely used is  Ponceau 4R, or Cochineal Red A(FD&amp;C Red No.4) It is a  synthetic coal tar and azo dye, carcinogen in animals, can produce bad reactions in asthmatics and people allergic to aspirin; banned in USA &amp; Norway
http://www.foodreactions.org/allergy/additives/100.html
I believe that colour should not be included as the original recipe.

You can add that some restuarants use colour. I would not prefer to promote something that causes cancer. USA and Norway know better and have banned it.</text>

      <comment>/* Conditional Operator */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Conditional Operator ===
'''Conditional operators''' (also known as ternary operators) allow a programmer to check: if (x is more than 10 and eggs is less than 20 and x is not equal to a...).

Most operators compare two variables; the one to the left, and the one to the right. However, C++ also has a ternary operator (sometimes known as the conditional operator), '''?:''' which chooses from two expressions based on the value of a condition expression. The basic syntax is:

  ''condition-expression'' ? ''expression-if-true'' : ''expression-if-false''

If ''condition-expression'' is true, the expression returns the value of ''expression-if-true''. Otherwise, it returns the value of ''expression-if-false''. Because of this, the ternary operator can often be used in place of the '''if''' expression. 

{{NOTE|The use of the ternary operator versus the '''if''' expression often depends on the level of complexity and overall impact of the logical decision tree, using the '''if''' expression in convoluted or less than obvious situations should be preferred as it can not only be more clearly written but easier to understand, thus avoiding simple logical errors that would otherwise be hard to perceive.}}

*'''For example:'''
 '''int''' foo = 8;
 std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;foo is &quot; &lt;&lt; (foo &lt; 10 ? &quot;smaller than&quot; : &quot;greater than or equal to&quot;) &lt;&lt; &quot; 10.&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
The output will be &quot;foo is smaller than 10.&quot;.

      <comment>why?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Comments ====
Comments are portions of the code ignored by the compiler which allow the user to make simple notes in the relevant areas of the source code. Comments come either in block form or as single lines.
*'''Single-line comments''' (informally, ''C++ style''), start with &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; and continue until the end of the line. If the last character in a comment line is a &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; the comment will continue in the next line.
*'''Multi-line  comments''' (informally, ''C style''), start with &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; and end with &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;.

{{NOTE|Since the 1999 revision, C also allows ''C++ style'' comments, so the informal names are largely of historical interest that serves to make a distinction of the two methods of commenting.}}

We will now describe how a comment can be added to the source code, but not where, how, and when to comment; we will get into that later.

===== ''C style'' comments =====
If you use this kind of comment try to use it like this...
Commented

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
/*void EventLoop(); /**/
&lt;/source&gt;

or for multiple lines

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
/*
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
/**/
&lt;/source&gt;

this opens you the option to do this...
Uncommented

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void EventLoop(); /**/
&lt;/source&gt;

or for multiple lines

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
/**/
&lt;/source&gt;
 
{{NOTE|Some compilers may generate errors/warnings.&lt;br&gt;
Try to avoid using C style inside a function because of the non nesting facility of C style (most editors now have some sort of coloring ability that prevents this kind of error, but it was very common to miss it, and you shouldn't make assumptions on how the code is read). }}

... by removing only the start of comment and so activating the next one, you did re-activate the commented code, because if you start a comment this way it will be valid until it finds the close of comment &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt;. 

{{NOTE|Remember that C-style comments &lt;code&gt;/* like this */&lt;/code&gt; do not &quot;nest&quot;, i.e., you can't write 
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
int function() /* This is a comment /*
{              
 return 0;  
}              and this is the same comment */
               so this isn't in the comment, and will give an error*/ 
&lt;/source&gt;

because of the text &lt;tt&gt;so this is not in the comment */&lt;/tt&gt; at the end of the line, which is not inside the comment; the comment ends at the first &lt;tt&gt;*/&lt;/tt&gt; sequence it finds, ignoring any interim &lt;tt&gt;/*&lt;/tt&gt; sequence, which might look to human readers like the start of a nested comment.
}}

===== ''C++ style'' comments =====
Examples:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
// This is a single one line comment
&lt;/source&gt;

or

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
if (expression) // This needs a comment
{
  statements;   
}
else
{
  statements;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The backslash is a continuation character and will continue the comment to the following line:

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;
// This comment will also comment the following line \&lt;br&gt;
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This line will not print&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;&lt;/font&gt;

;Using comments to temporarily ignore code
Comments are also sometimes used to enclose code that we temporarily want the compiler to ignore. This can be useful in finding errors in the program. If a program does not give the desired result, it might be possible to track which particular statement contains the error by commenting out code.

; Example with ''C style'' comments

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
/* This is a single line comment */
&lt;/source&gt;

or 

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
/*
   This is a multiple line comment
*/
&lt;/source&gt;

; ''C'' and ''C++ style''
Combining multi-line comments (&lt;code&gt;/* */&lt;/code&gt;) with c++ comments (&lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;) to comment out multiple lines of code:

Commenting out the code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
/*
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
//*/
&lt;/source&gt;

uncommenting the code chunk

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
//*
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
void EventLoop();
//*/
&lt;/source&gt;

This works because a &lt;code&gt;//*&lt;/code&gt; is still a c++ comment. And &lt;code&gt;//*/&lt;/code&gt; acts as a c++ comment and a multi-line comment terminator. However this doesn't work if there are any multi-line comments are used for function descriptions.

; Note on doing it with preprocessor statements
Another way (considered bad practice) is to selectively enable disable sections of code:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#if(0)   // Change this to 1 to uncomments.
void EventLoop();
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

this is considered a bad practice because the code often becomes illegible when several #if's are mixed, if you use them don't forget to add a comment at the #endif saying what #if it correspond

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
#if (FEATURE_1 == 1)
do_something;
#endif //FEATURE_1 == 1
&lt;/source&gt;

you can prevent illegibility by using {{C++ Programming/kw|inline}} functions (often considered better than macros for legibility with no performance cost) containing only 2 sections in #if #else #endif

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
inline do_test()
  {
    #if (Feature_1 == 1)
      do_something
    #endif  //FEATURE_1 == 1
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

and call

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
do_test();
&lt;/source&gt;

in the program

{{NOTE|The use of one-line C-style comments should be avoided as they are considered outdated. Mixing C and C++ style single-line comments is considered poor practice. One exception, that is commonly used, is to disable a specific part of code in the middle of a single line statement for test/debug purposes, in release code any need for such action should be removed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Marketing Approach==

This is to help with interaction with possible students:

1. Myspace page for Potential MMI Students&lt;br&gt;
2. Facebook Group
:*These social networks are huge with all ages right now.
3. Unique packaging of our product&lt;br&gt;
4. Emails and direct mail (registrar help?)&lt;br&gt;
5. TV - maybe a 30 sec. TV spot to run with the other College Weekend spots on KGEB, Hour of Healing, and Make your Day Count&lt;br&gt;
6. VISUALS - Have the goods, i.e. camera, audio board, etc. in the pit for the college weekenders to see. This will draw them downstairs for a tour.&lt;br&gt;
7. Customize the mailings and packaging
:*Have our information packaged in a box that resembles a camera, film canister, or a DVD case. Have our label on the case and when they open it it has our information inside, a colorful brochure, maybe something like an interactive DVD, CD, etc. Possibly some of our projects from TV intro up through the Institute classes. Give them an idea what they will be doing.&lt;br&gt;
8. It’s important to contact them prior to the weekend. Maybe 2-3 times before college weekend. Especially within 2 months before College Weekend. Start in summer and express our interest in them!! SEE MARKETING SCHEDULE.&lt;br&gt;
9. Have something ready for them when they arrive with their name and information on it. Singling them out makes the feel welcomed and special!!
&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Program Description==
Chase is a simple yet enjoyable game.  In it, players take the role of a &quot;greater-than&quot; symbol (&gt;) who is hungry to eat some X's.  It is played on the regular typing screen, and there are 6 characters that can move around the screen.  One is the player's character, the &gt; sign.  Another, the X, is the character that the player is supposed to move towards and eat once he has reached it.  The other four, however, are &quot;not-equal-to&quot; symbols (≠) which are vicious and will try to eat the player if they get close enough.  Chase has a title screen that draws itself up on the Graph screen through the CSTART program, which must also be on a player's calculator before he can play Chase.  The title screen has four options which are:
&lt;br&gt;1) New Game (to start a new game)
&lt;br&gt;2) Continue (to continue a currently saved game)
&lt;br&gt;3) Instructions (to bring up the instructions for Chase)
&lt;br&gt;4) Quit (to leave the program and return to the main screen).

In the Instructions page, much of the above information is covered, as well as other information like which keys are used for the game controls.  In the game, the five non-player characters (the four ≠'s and the X) move around on their own, randomly following any of four patterns.  For instance, if one of the ≠'s moves a space left, then another will move up, another will move down, and another will move right.  Two ≠'s will never move in the same direction as one another in one move.  Also, the movement of the X will parallel that of one of the four monsters.  The controls that the player uses to move are displayed on the Instructions page.  The player can press any of the 9 number keys (1-9) except for the 5 to move his character.  For instance, pressing the 7 key will move the player's character up one space and to the left one space, and pressing the 8 key will only move the player's character up one space.  This explanation may be difficult to understand but is very easy to figure out by playing the game.

The player's score is displayed in the upper-right corner of the screen throughout the game.  Whenever the player eats the X character, one point will be added to his score in the display.  Also, the X will disappear and be regenerated somewhere else on the screen.  The player's high score is displayed in the Chase title screen every time he starts the game.

One last control is the ENTER key, which pauses/saves the game that you are currently playing.  If the player presses it once while he's playing, he can save his game and come back to it whenever he wishes by starting prgmCHASE and choosing option 2, Continue, mentioned above.  Also, by pressing the ENTER key twice while playing, once to pause/save the game and then once again, He can resume immediately and play will continue.  The effects of this are that all of the variables for things like score and position of each character on the screen are stored and also, the game will regain its regular running speed.  Unfortunately, whenever one is running a TI-Basic program that repeats, it will eventually run slower and slower.  To avoid or solve this problem when playing Chase, one can use this method of pressing ENTER twice.  As stated above, this exits the program and then resumes it again.

Note:  The variables used by the calculator to operate Chase are stored in the [J] matrix.

==Program Code==
Notes:
#Many of these lines of code can be linked together in one line by just typing a &quot;:&quot; instead of pressing ENTER and typing the next command on the next line.  Also, some of the commands displayed here are already linked in this way.
#The &quot;¤&quot; found in the command, &quot; :Output(8,3,&quot;-GAME¤SAVED- &quot;, is actually a very small square and it can be found in the CATALOG menu on your calculator.  It will be above what looks like a small plus sign (+), near the bottom of the list.

The plants of the genus '''''Lilium''''' are the true lily plants, comprising a genus of about 100 species in the lily family, Liliaceae. They are important as showy and large flowered garden plants, and in literature.

Lilies are native to the northern temperate regions. Their range in the Old World extends across much of Europe, the north Mediterranean, across most of Asia to Japan, south to the Nilgiri mountains in India, and south to the Philippines. In the New World they extend from southern Canada through much of the United States. A few species formerly included within this genus have now been placed in other genera. These include ''[[../Cardiocrinum/]]'' and ''[[../Nomocharis/]]''. 

==Description==
Lilies are usually erect leafy stemmed herbs. The majority of species form naked or tunic-less scaly underground bulbs from which they overwinter. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons. A few species form bulbs at or near the soil surface . 

Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb. 

The large flowers have three petals along with three petal-like sepals, often fragrant, and come in a range of colours ranging through whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds, purples, bronze and even nearly black.  Markings include spots, brush strokes and picotees. 

The plants are summer flowering.  Most species are deciduous, but ''Lilium candidum'' bears a basal rosette of leaves for much of the year. Flowers are formed at the top of a single erect stem, with leaves being borne at intervals up the stem.

==Growing conditions==
They are commonly adapted to either woodland habitats, often mountain, or sometimes to grassland habitats. A few can survive in marshland and a single one is known to live as an epiphyte (''L. arboricola''). In general they prefer moderately acidic or lime-free soils. 

==Species==
[[Image:Lilium canadense.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Asiatic hybrid flower]]
Numerous forms are grown for the garden, and most of these are hybrids. They vary according to their parent species, and are classified in the following broad groups;
*'''Species''' (Division IX). All natural species and naturally occurring forms are included in this group. 
*'''Asiatic hybrids''' (Division I). These are plants with medium sized, upright or outward facing flowers, mostly unscented. They are derived from central and east Asian species. 
*'''Martagon hybrids''' (Division II). These are based on ''L. martagon'' and ''L. hansonii''. The flowers are nodding, Turk's cap style (with the petals strongly recurved). 
*'''Candidum hybrids''' (Division III). This includes hybrids of ''L. candidum'' with several other mostly European species. 
*'''American hybrids''' (Division IV). These are mostly taller growing forms, originally derived from ''L. pardalinum''. Many are clump-forming perennials with rhizomatous rootstocks. 
*'''Longiflorum hybrids''' (Division V). These are cultivated forms of this species and its subspecies. They are most important as plants for cut flowers, and are less often grown in the garden than other hybrids. 
*'''Trumpet lilies''' (Division VI), including Aurelian hybrids. This group includes hybrids of many Asiatic species, including ''L. regale'' and ''L. aurelianse''. The flowers are trumpet shaped, facing outward or somewhat downward, and tend to be  strongly fragrant, often especially night-fragrant. 
*'''Oriental hybrids''' (Division VII). These are based on hybrids of ''L. auratum'' and ''L. speciosum'', together with crossbreeds from several mainland Asiatic species. They are fragrant, and the flowers tend to be outward facing. Plants tend to be tall, and the flowers may be quite large. An example is [[w:Lilium &quot;Stargazer&quot;]].
*'''Other hybrids''' (Division VIII). Includes all other garden hybrids.

==Uses==
Many species are widely grown in the garden in temperate and sub-tropical regions. Sometimes they may also be grown as potted plants. A large number of ornamental hybrids have been developed. They can be used in herbaceous borders, woodland and shrub plantings, and as a patio plant. 

Some lilies, especially ''[[../Lilium longiflorum/]]'', as well as a few other hybrids, form  important cut flower crops. These tend to be forced for particular markets; for instance, ''L. longiflorum'' for the Easter trade, when it may be called the Easter lily. 

''Lilium'' bulbs are starchy and edible as root vegetables, although bulbs of some species may be very bitter.  The non-bitter bulbs of ''[[../Lilium lancifolium/]]'', ''[[../Lilium pumilum/]]'', and especially ''[[../Lilium brownii/]]'' (called [[wiktionary:百|百]][[wiktionary:合|合]][[wiktionary:干|干]] in Chinese) are grown at large scale in China as a luxury or health food, most often sold in dry form.  They are eaten especially in the summer, for their ability to reduce internal heat.  They may be reconstituted and stir-fried, grated and used to thicken soup, or processed to extract starch.  Their texture and taste draw comparison with the potato, although the individual bulb scales are much smaller.

Although they are believed to be safe for humans to eat, there are reports of nephrotoxicosis (kidney failure) in cats which have eaten some species of ''Lilium'' and ''[[../Hemerocallis/]]'' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12680447&amp;dopt=Abstract].

Lilies are considered the most common of flowers to be presented at funerals.  The presence of Lilies at funerals symbolizes that the soul of the departed has received restored innocence after death. 

==Maintenance==
Maintaining Asian lilies means as a basic rule to keep the bulbs cool and not watered in winter. More than just some basic moisture might cause the bulb to rot.

==Propagation==
Liliums can be propagated in several ways; 
* by division of the bulbs, 
* by growing-on ''bulbils'' which are adventitious bulbs formed on the stem,
* by scaling, for which whole scales are detached from the bulb and planted to form a new bulb,
* by seed; seed germination patterns are variable and can be complex.

== The Binary Number System ==

Most computer systems operate using binary logic. The computer represents value using two voltage levels, usually 0V for ''logic 0'' and either +3.3V or +5V for ''logic 1''.  These two voltage levels represent exactly two different values and by convention, the values are ''zero'' and ''one''. These two values coincidentally, correspond to the two digits used by the binary number system.  Since there is a correspondence between the logic levels used by the computer and the two digits used in the binary numbering system, it should come as no surprise that computers employ the binary system.  

=== Binary Number Formats ===

The binary number system uses ''base 2'' which includes only the digits '''0''' and '''1'''. 

In the United States among other countries, every three decimal digits is separated with a comma to make larger numbers easier to read. For example, 123,456,789 is much easier to read than 123456789. We adopt a similar convention for binary numbers. In order to make binary numbers more readable, we add a space every four digits starting from the least significant digit, on the left of the decimal point. For example, the binary value 1010111110110010 will be written as ''1010 1111 1011 0010''. 

Using the above example ''1010 1111 1011 0010'':

* The rightmost sequence ''(0010)'' is in bit position zero, holding value '''0'''.  Bit zero is referred to as the ''least significant bit'', or ''lsb''

* Each bit to the left is given the next successive bit number. ''bit 1'', ''bit 2'' and so on...

* The left-most bit ''(1010)'' is typically called the ''most significant bit'', or ''msb,'' holding value '''1'''.

We typically write binary numbers as a sequence of bits. There are defined boundaries for the different sizes of a bit:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Name !! Size (bits) !! Example
|-
| Bit || 1 || 1
|-
| Nibble || 4 || 0101
|-
| Byte || 8 || 0000 0101
|-
| Word || 16 || 0000 0000 0000 0101
|-
| Double Word || 32 || 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0101
|} 

In any number base, we may add as many leading zeroes without ever changing its value, but in the binary number system, adding leading zeroes adjusts the bit to a desired size.  
For example, we can represent the number '''5''' as a: 

Bit 101; 

Nibble 0101; 

Byte 0000 0101;   

Word 0000 0000 0000 0101; or 

Double Word 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0101 

==== Notes on Names ====

;The Word
The boundary for a Word can be defined as either 16-bits or the size of the data bus for the processor.  Therefore, a Word and Double Word is not a fixed size but varies from system to system - depending on the processor.  

For the 8085 and 8086 microprocessors, a word is a group of 16 bits. We number the bits in a word starting from bit zero (b0) through fifteen (b15) as follows: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b15
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b14
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b13
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b12
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b11
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b10
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b9
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b8
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b7
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b6
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b5
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b4
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b3
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b2
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b1
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; | b0
|-
|} 

Remember, '''b0''' is the ''LSB'' and '''b15''' is the ''msb'' and when referencing the other bits in a word use their bit position number.  Notice that a word contains exactly two bytes. '''b0-b7''' form the low order byte, '''b8-b15''' form the high order byte. Naturally, a word may be further broken down into four nibbles. Nibble zero is the low order nibble '''(b0-b4)''' and nibble three is the high order nibble '''(b12-b15)''' of the word. The other two nibbles are &quot;nibble one&quot; and &quot;nibble two&quot;. 

With 16 bits, you can represent '''2^16''' or '''65,536''' different values. These could be the ''unsigned'' numeric values in the range of 0 =&gt; 65,535, ''signed'' numeric values which include both positive and negative values in the range of -32,768 =&gt; +32,767, or any other data type with no more than '''65,536''' values.   The three major uses for words are

* 16-bit integer data values
* 16-bit memory addresses
* any number system requiring 16 bits or less

;The Double Word 
A double word is exactly that, two words, so a double word quantity is 32 bits. Naturally, this double word can be divided into a high order word and a low order word, four bytes, or eight nibbles.

Double words can represent all kinds of different data:
* an ''unsigned'' double word in the range of 0 =&gt; 4,294,967,295
* a ''signed'' double word in the range - 2,147,483,648 =&gt; +2,147,483,647
* a 32-bit floating point value
* any data that requires 32 bits or less

=== Number Base Conversion ===
====Binary to Decimal====

It is very easy to convert from a binary number to a decimal number.  

For example let's breakdown the binary value ''1100 1010'':   
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''digit'''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | ''1''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | ''1''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | ''0''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | ''0''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | ''1''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | ''0''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | ''1''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | ''0''
|-
|  '''bit number''' || b7  ||  b6  ||  b5  ||  b4  ||  b3  ||  b2  ||  b1  ||  b0
|-
|  '''base 2''' || ''2^7''||  ''2^6'' ||  ''2^5'' ||  ''2^4'' ||  ''2^3'' ||  ''2^2'' ||  ''2^1'' ||  ''2^0''
|} 

Now just like the decimal system, we multiply each digit by ''base 2'' and its ''weighted position value'', then find the sum, like this: 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''1'''''(2^7)''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''1'''''(128)''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''''128'''''
|-
| '''1'''''(2^6)'' || '''1'''''(64)'' || '''''64'''''
|-
| '''0'''''(2^5)'' || '''0'''''(32)'' || '''''0'''''
|-
| '''0'''''(2^4)'' || '''0'''''(16)'' || '''''0'''''
|-
| '''1'''''(2^3)'' || '''1'''''(8)'' || '''''8'''''
|-
| '''0'''''(2^2)'' || '''0'''''(4)'' ||'''''0'''''
|-
| '''1'''''(2^1)'' || '''1'''''(2)'' || '''''2'''''
|-
| '''0'''''(2^0)'' || '''0'''''(1)'' || '''''0'''''
|-
|       ||     ||    '''''=202'''''
|}

====Decimal to Binary====

To convert from decimal to binary is slightly more difficult.  

There are two methods, ''division by 2'' and ''subtraction by the weighted position value''. 

=====The Division Method=====

For this, we divide the decimal number by 2, if the remainder is ''0'' write down a ''0''. If the remainder is ''1'', then write down a ''1''. This process is continued until the quotient is ''0''. 

The remainders will represent the binary equivalent of the decimal number.  The remainder values are written from the least significant digit to the more significant digit.  So each new remainder value is written to the ''left'' of the previous.    

For example, consider the number ''2671''. 

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|  style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; |'''Division'''
|  style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; |'''Quotient'''
|  style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; |'''Remainder'''
|  style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; |'''Binary Number'''
|-
|  2671 / 2 || 1335  ||  1  || '''1'''
|-
|  1335 / 2 || 667 || 1 || '''11'''
|-
|  667 / 2 || 333 || 1 || '''111'''
|-
| 333 / 2 || 166 || 1  ||'''1111'''
|-
| 166 / 2 ||  83 || 0 || '''0 1111'''
|-
| 83 / 2 || 41 || 1 || '''10 1111'''
|-
| 41 / 2 || 20 || 1 || '''110 1111'''
|-
| 20 / 2 || 10 || 0 ||  '''0110 1111'''
|-
| 10 / 2 || 5 || 0 || '''0 0110 1111'''
|-
| 5 / 2 || 2 ||  1 || '''10 0110 1111'''
|-
| 2 / 2 || 1 || 0 || '''010 0110 1111'''
|-
| 1 / 2 || 0 || 1 || '''1010 0110 1111'''
|-
|}

=====The Subtraction Method=====

Start with a weighted position value greater than the number.  If the number is less than the weighted value, write down a ''0'' and subtract ''0''.  If the number is greater than the weighted value, write down a ''1'' but subtract the weighted value instead.  This process is continued until the result is ''0''.  

When performing the subtraction method, the digits will represent the binary equivalent of the decimal number from the most significant digit to the lesser significant digit.  So each new digit is written to the ''right'' of the previous.

Consider the same number, ''2671'' 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | '''Weighted Value'''
| style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | '''Subtraction'''
| style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | '''Remainder'''
| style=&quot;width:150px;&quot; | '''Binary Number'''
|-
| 2^12 = ''4096'' || 2671 - 0 ||  2671 || '''0'''
|-
| 2^11 = ''2048'' || 2671 -2048 || 623 || '''01'''
|-
| 2^10 = ''1024'' || 623 - 0 ||  623  ||  '''010'''
|-
| 2^9 = ''512'' ||  623 - 512 || 111 || '''0101'''
|-
| 2^8 = ''256'' ||  111 - 0  || 111  || '''0 1010'''
|-
| 2^7 = ''128'' || 111 - 0 ||  111 || '''01 0100'''
|-
| 2^6 = ''64'' ||  111 - 64  || 47 || '''0 1010 01'''
|-
| 2^5 = ''32''  || 47 - 32 || 15  || '''0 1010 011'''
|-
| 2^4 = ''16'' || 15 - 0 || 15 || '''0 1010 0110'''
|-
| 2^3 = ''8'' ||  15 - 8  || 7 ||  '''0 1010 0110 1'''
|-
| 2^2 = ''4''  || 7 - 4 || 3 || '''0 1010 0110 11'''
|-
|  2^1 = ''2'' || 3 - 2 || 1 ||  '''0 1010 0110 111'''
|-
|  2^0 = ''1'' || 1 - 1 || 0 || '''0 1010 0110 1111'''
|-
|}

== The Octal Number System ==

Although this was once a popular number base, especially in the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP/8 and other old computer systems, it is rarely used today. The Octal system is based on the binary system with a 3-bit boundary.  

The Octal system uses base 8 which includes only the digits ''0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7'' (any other digit would make the number an invalid octal number).

|-
|} 

===Binary to Octal Conversion===

It is easy to convert a binary value to an octal number.  

First, break the binary number into 3-bit sections from the ''LSB'' to the ''MSB'' then convert the 3-bit binary number to its octal equivalent.  

Let's breakdown the binary value '''1010111110110010''': 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:100px;&quot; |'''3-bit'''
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot;| '''001'''
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot;|'''010'''
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; |'''111'''
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; |'''110'''
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; |'''110'''
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; |'''010'''
|-
|  || ''MSB'' || || || || || ''LSB''
|-
|'''Octal Digit'''|| 1  || 2 || 7 || 6 || 6 ||2
|-
|}

===Octal to Binary Conversion===

It is also easy to convert from an octal number to a binary value. 

Convert the decimal number to its 3-bit binary equivalent, then combine the 3-bit sections.

Let's take the above octal number, '''127662''' and break it down:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''Octal Digit'''
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; | '''3-bit'''
|-
| ''1''|| ''001''
|-
| ''2'' || ''010''
|-
| ''7'' || ''111''
|-
| ''6'' || ''110''
|-
| ''6'' || ''110''
|-
| ''2'' || ''010''
|-
|}

This yields the binary number '''001010111110110010''' or '''0000 1010 1111 1011 0010''' in our more readable format.

===Octal to Decimal Conversion===

To convert from Octal to Decimal, multiply the value in each position by its Octal weight and add each value. 

Again, let's take the Octal value, '''127662'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''1'''''(8^5)''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''1'''''(32768)''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''''32768'''''
|-
| '''2'''''(8^4)'' || '''2'''''(4096)'' || '''''8192'''''
|-
| '''7'''''(8^3)'' || '''7'''''(512)'' || '''''3584'''''
|-
| '''6'''''(8^2)'' || '''6'''''(64)'' || '''''384'''''
|-
| '''6'''''(8^1)'' || '''6'''''(8)'' || '''''48'''''
|-
| '''2'''''(8^0)'' || '''2'''''(1)'' || '''''2''''' 
|-
|       ||     ||    '''''=44978'''''
|} 

===Decimal to Octal Conversion===

To convert decimal to octal is slightly more difficult. 

The typical method to convert from decimal to octal is repeated division by 8. For this method, divide the decimal number by 8, and write the remainder on the side as the least significant digit. This process is continued by dividing he quotient by 8 and writing the remainder until the quotient is 0. When performing the division, the remainders which will represent the octal equivalent of the decimal number are written beginning at the least significant digit (right) and each new digit is written to the next more significant digit (the left) of the previous digit. Consider the number 44978.

|-

''As you can see, we are back with the original number.''

==Hexadecimal Number System==

A big problem with the binary system is verbosity. For example, eight binary digits are required to represent the value 202 while the decimal version requires only three decimal digits. Especially with large values, binary numbers become too unwieldy. The hexadecimal numbering system solves these problems.

Hexadecimal numbers are very compact and it is easy to convert from hex to binary and binary to hex.  Since we'll often need to enter hexadecimal numbers into the computer system, we need a different mechanism for representing hexadecimal numbers since you cannot enter a subscript to denote the radix of the associated value.  

The Hexadecimal system is based on the binary system using a Nibble or 4-bit boundary. In Assembly Language programming, most assemblers require the first digit of a hexadecimal number to be ''0'', and we place an ''H'' at the end of the number to denote the number base.

The hexadecimal number system uses ''base 16'', which includes only the digits ''0'' through ''9'' and the letters ''A, B, C, D, E,'' and ''F''.

This table provides all the information you'll ever need to convert from one number base into any other number base for the decimal values from 0 to 16.

===Hexadecimal to Binary===

To convert a hexadecimal number into a binary number:

1.  Breakdown the hexadecimal number into each individual Hexa digit

2.  Substitute the corresponding binary value for each Hexa digit 

3.  Each binary value is written from the beginning of the ''MSB'' (left) to the ''LSB'' (right)

For example, to convert '''0ABCDH''' into a binary value, simply convert each hexadecimal digit according to the table above. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

===Binary to Hexadecimal===

To convert a binary number into the hexadecimal format is almost as easy.

For example, given the binary number '''1011001010''', the first step would be to add two zeros in the ''MSB'' position so that it contains 12 bits.  Then separate the binary value into groups of four bits, so the revised binary value reads '''0010 1100 1010'''.  Then we look up the binary values in the table above and substitute the appropriate hexadecimal digit:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- 
|style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; | '''0010'''
|style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; | '''''2'''''
|-
|'''1100''' || '''''C'''''
|-
|'''1010''' || '''''A'''''
|-
|}

Therefore '''0010 1100 1010''' = '''''2CA'''''

Another example, '''1010111110110010''' converts into '''''AFB2'''''.

===Hexadecimal to Decimal conversion===

The weighted values for each position is as follows:  
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; | 16^0
| style=&quot;width:50px;&quot; | 1
|-
| 16^1 || 16
|-
| 16^2 || 256 
|-
| 16^3 || 4096 
|-
|}

To convert from Hex to Decimal, multiply the value in each position by its weighted value then add. Using the table above and the previous example, '''0AFB2H''', we expect to obtain the decimal value ''44978''.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''A'''''(16^3)''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''10'''''(4096)''
| style=&quot;width:75px;&quot; | '''''40960'''''
|-
| '''F'''''(16^2)'' || '''15'''''(256)'' || '''''3840'''''
|-
| '''B'''''(16^1)'' || '''11'''''(16)'' || '''''176'''''
|-
| '''2'''''(16^0)'' || '''2'''''(1)'' || '''''2'''''
|-
|       ||     ||    '''''=44978'''''
|} 

===Decimal to Hex===

To convert from decimal to hex is slightly more difficult. The typical method is repeated ''division by 16''. 

While we may also use repeated ''subtraction by the weighted position value'', it is more difficult for large decimal numbers.

''The Division Method''

Divide the decimal number by 16, and write the remainder on the side as the least significant digit. This process is continued until the quotient is ''0''. When performing the division, the remainders which will represent the hex equivalent of the decimal number are written beginning at the least significant digit (right) and each new digit is written to the next more significant digit (the left) of the previous digit. Consider the number 44978.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- 
| style=&quot;width:125px;&quot; | '''Division'''
| style=&quot;width:125px;&quot; | '''Quotient'''
| style=&quot;width:125px;&quot; | '''Remainder'''
| style=&quot;width:125px;&quot; | '''Hex Number'''
|- 
| 44978 / 16 || 2811  || 2 ||	'''2'''
|-
| 2811 / 16 ||	175 ||	11 ||	'''B2'''
|-
| 175 / 16 || 	10 || 	15  ||	'''FB2'''
|-
| 10 / 16 || 	0 || 10 || '''0AFB2'''
|-
|}

:'''''44978 = 0AFB2'''''

''When you use hex numbers in an 8085 program, the Assembler usually requires the most significant hex digit to be 0 even if this number of digits exceed the size of the register. This is an Assembler requirement and your value will be assembled correctly.''

===Hex Addition===

'''Add as if decimal numbers, except''': 

If individual digits are A through F, we must convert to its decimal equivalent (values from the table above) then add.  

For example:

find the sum of D + C  

''0DH'' = ''13'' and ''0CH'' = ''12'' so;

''13 + 12 = 25'' therefore; 

''D + C = 25'' but;

If the sum is greater than or equal to 16, we replace the sum with the sum minus 16 and carry over 1.

For example: 

25 - 16 = 9; then

D  +  C = 19; and finally

3) if the sum is between 10 and 15 (decimal), we replace the sum with the equivalent hexadecimal digit, for example:

{| 
|-
| carries || --&gt; ||   1  1
|-
| || || DF6D
|-
| || +|| 246C
|-
| overflow ||--&gt; '''1''' || '''03D9'''
|}

==Conversion Between Different Number Systems==
===Positional number systems===

Our decimal number system is known as a positional number system because the value of the number depends on the position of the digits. For example, the number 123 is different from 321 even though the same digits are used. Other ancient number systems used additional symbols to represent larger values, but in a positional number system the value of each digit is determined by its place in the full number. The lowest place value is the rightmost position, and each successive position to the left has a higher place value.  The rightmost position represents the &quot;ones&quot; column, the next position represents the &quot;tens&quot; column, the next position represents &quot;hundreds&quot;, etc. Therefore, the number 123 represents 1 hundred and 2 tens and 3 ones, whereas the number 321 represents 3 hundreds and 2 tens and 1 one.

The values of each position correspond to powers of the base of the number system. So for our decimal number system, which uses base 10, the place values correspond to powers of 10:

{| 
|-
|10^0 ||= 1
|-
|10^1 ||= 10
|-
|10^2 ||= 100
|-
|10^3 ||= 1000
|}

===Converting from other number bases to decimal===

Other number systems use different bases. The binary number system uses base 2, so the place values of the digits of a binary number correspond to powers of 2. 

For example, the value of the binary number '''10011''' is determined by computing the ''place value of each of the binary digits of the number'':

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''1''' || '''0''' || '''0''' || '''1''' || '''1''' || ''the binary number''  
|-
| (2^4) || (2^3) || (2^2) || (2^1) || (2^0) || ''place values''
|}

So the binary number '''10011''' represents the value

{|
| '''1''' (2^4) ||+	'''0'''(2^3)|| + '''0''' (2^2)	||+ '''1''' (2^1) || +'''1''' ( 2^0)
|-
|=  ''16'' || +	''0''||	+ ''0''||	+	''2''||	+	''1''
|-
| =	'''''19'''''
|-
|}

The same principle applies to any number base. For example, the number '''2132 base 5''' corresponds to
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| '''2'''|| '''1'''|| '''3'''|| '''2'''	|| ''number in base 5''
|-
| (5^3) || (5^2) || (5^1) || (5^0|| ''place values''
|}

So the value of the number '''2132 base 5''' is

{|
| '''2'''(5^3)||+'''1'''(5^2) ||+'''3'''(5^1)||+'''2'''(5^0)
|-
| ='''2'''(125)||+'''1'''(25)||+'''3'''(5)||+'''2'''(1)
|-
| = ''250''||+''25''||+''15''||+''2''
|- 
| = '''''292'''''
|}

===Converting from decimal to other number bases===

In order to convert a decimal number into different number bases, we have to be able to express the number in terms of powers of the other base. To convert the decimal number ''100'' to base 4, we must figure out how to express ''100'' as the ''sum of powers of 4'', for example:  
{| 
|''100''=|| 1('''64''')|| + 2('''16''')||+ 1('''4''') ||+ 0('''1''')
|-
|||= '''1'''(''4^3'') || + '''2'''(''4^2'') || + '''1'''(''4^1'') || + '''0'''(''4^0'')
|-
|}

Then we use the coefficients of the powers of 4 to form the number as represented in base 4:
{| 
| 100 || = '''1''' || '''2''' || '''1''' || '''0''' || ''base 4''
|-
|}	 	 

Another method is to repeatedly divide the decimal number by the base in which it is to be converted until the quotient becomes zero. As the number is divided, the ''remainders - in reverse order'' - form the digits of the number in the other base.  For example: 

Convert the decimal number 82 to base 6:
{|
| 82/6	|| = 13	remainder '''4'''
|- 
| 13/6 || = 2 remainder '''1'''
|-
| 2/6 || = 0 remainder '''2'''
|-
|}

The answer is formed by taking the ''remainders in reverse order'':  '''''2 1 4  base  6''''' 
 
Example conversions between number systems: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|'''Decimal''' || '''Binary''' || '''Hex'''
|-
| 255 || 1111 1111 ||  FF
|-
|93 || 0101 1101 || 5D
|-
|}

==Fixed length binary numbers==

Computer arithmetic is performed on data stored in fixed length memory locations, typically 8, 16, or 32 bits.

Special problems occur in manipulating fixed length numbers. The number 280 (base 10) is larger than the maximum 8-bit number; this results in a carry beyond 8 bits in the binary representation and a carry beyond two digits in the hexadecimal representation. When doing arithmetic using fixed length numbers, these carries are potentially lost. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Decimal !!Binary !!Hex
|-
| 201 ||   11001001 ||   C9
|-
| +79|| +01001111 || +4F
|-
| '''280''' || '''1 00011000''' || '''1 18'''
|}

===Negative numbers===

Signed magnitude - Use one bit for sign, 7 bits for number. 

Example: -1 (in an 8-bit system) could be 1000 0001 (base 2)

2's complement (most often used in computing)

Example: the 2's complement number representing -1 (in an 8-bit system) would be 1111 1111 (base 2) 

===Complement numbers===
Consider odometer numbers on a bicycle:
Consider odometer numbers on a bicycle:
 
Decimal examples
Odometer numbers are useful for both addition and subtraction (complements) of signed numbers. 
- 2     + 998
+ 3     + 003
+ 1     1 001

In the second example, the correct result is just the +001; the overflow is ignored in fixed-length complement arithmetic. 
Do subtraction as addition by using complements, i.e.
A - B = A + (-B) 
Important: It is easier to compute -B and add than to subtract directly. 
Example: 
- 005     + 995
+ 003     + 997
+ 008     1 992

Note that 995 and 997 were added in the normal fashion, the overflow was ignored, and the result was 992, which can be converted from the complement (or odometer) system back to -8, the correct answer. 
 signed   3-bit complement
     +3   003
     +2   002
     +1   001
      0   000
     -1   999
     -2   998
     -3   997
     -4   996
     -5   995
     -6   994
     -7   993
     -8   992

decimal   2's complement binary
   +127   01111111
   +126   01111110
   +125   01111101
    ...   ........
     +2   00000010
     +1   00000001
      0   00000000
     -1   11111111
     -2   11111110
    ...   ........
   -127   10000001
   -128   10000000

There are 256 numbers in an 8-bit fixed length 2's complement number system.
Why are these numbers called 2's complement? 
M - N = M + (-N) 
where -N is the complement of N. 
 
Example: 
decimal
    + 1   =     00000001
    - 1   =   + 11111111
      0   =   1 00000000

which does not equal 2^8, or 256; ignore the overflow, and the correct answer is zero. 
Now we need an easy way to do 2's complement operations. 
 
Example: 
What is the representation of -27 (base 10) in 2's complement 8-bit notation? 
  2^8 - 1     11111111
-      27   - 00011011
              11100100   corresponds to flipping all the bits;
                         also known as 1's complement
    add 1   + 00000001
   result     11100101   -27 in 2's complement representation

This approach is necessary because: 
1.	Fixed-length nature of numbers stored in a computer 
2.	More computationally efficient to implement a fast adder than an adder and a subtractor 
________________________________________
Examples of 2's complement number operations
Addition and subtraction in 2's complement form 
•	Addition: To compute N1 + N2, add N1 to N2 
•	Subtraction: To compute N1 - N2, add N1 to -N2 
Examples: 
decimal        binary           hex
    11   =     00001011   =     000B
  + 21   =   + 00010101   =   + 0015
    32   =     00100000   =     0020

    21   =     00010101   =     0015
  - 11   =   + 11110101   =   + FFF5
    10   =     00001010   =     000A

    11   =     00001011   =     000B
  - 21   =   + 11101011   =   + FFEB
  - 10   =     11110110   =     FFF6

  - 11   =     11110101   =     FFF5
  - 21   =   + 11101011   =   + FFEB
  - 32   =   1 11100000   =     FFE0

How we got the 2's complements of -11 and -21: 
 11     00001011
~11   - 11110100   1's complement
+ 1   + 00000001   add 1
-11     11110101   2's complement representation

Algorithm
1.	Store N. 
2.	Obtain ~N, the 1's complement of N, by replacing (bit by bit) every 0 with a 1 and vice versa in the number's binary representation. 
3.	Add 1 and ignore any carry after the eighth bit. 
Note: This algorithm works in hex by replacing each digit x with its hex complement, i.e. 15 - x. Example: The hex equivalent of 11 is $000B; its hex complement is then $FFF4, where each digit was computed as $F - x. Adding 1 to $FFF4 gives the result $FFF5 for the 2's complement of 11. (Using a dollar sign ($) before a number indicates that it is base 16.) 
Example: 
In binary: 
 N     0000 0110 0100 0111
~N   - 1111 1001 1011 1000   1's complement
+1   + 0000 0000 0000 0001   add 1
-N     1111 1001 1011 1001   2's complement representation

In hex: 
 N     0647
~N   - F9B8   1's complement
+1   + 0001   add 1
-N     F9B9   2's complement representation

A calculator will always give you the 2's complement directly. 
The Most Significant Bit (MSB) is the binary digit corresponding to the largest power of 2 and is always 1 for a negative 2's complement number. As a result it is often called the sign bit. 
In 2's complement, -0 = +0. Technically, 0 is the complement of itself.
 N     00000000
~N   - 11111111   1's complement
+1   + 00000001   add 1
-N     00000000   2's complement representation

________________________________________
Problems with fixed-length arithmetic
Overflow and underflow
For a 16-bit fixed-length number system,
 
Adding signed numbers can easily exceed these limits. 
first digit
       0011   $3000
       0110   $6000
       1001   $9000

This result, from adding two positive numbers in the number system, results in $9000, which is larger than $7FFF, the largest allowed positive number. In fact, $9000 equals 1001 0000 0000 0000, which is a negative number. The sign of the result is different from that of the operands. 
Rule: If there is a sign change in adding two positive 2's complement numbers, then overflow has occurred. 
We can generalize these rules to signed addition and subtraction. 
 
Sign extension
How about if numbers are of different length? 
decimal   2's complement binary
          3-bit 4-bit  8-bit
     +3   011   0011   00000011
     +2   010   0010   00000010
     +1   001   0001   00000001
      0   000   0000   00000000
     -1   111   1111   11111111
     -2   110   1110   11111110
     -3   101   1101   11111101
     -4   100   1100   11111100

To extend a 2's complement number to a greater number of binary digits, you just continue the sign bit to the left. 
Examples: Extend $9B to 16 bits. 
$9B = 1001 1011 = 1111 1111 1001 1011 = $FF9B

Extend $5F to 16 bits. 
$5F = 0101 1111 = 0000 0000 0101 1111 = $005F

Adding two 2's complement numbers of different length
43A0     43A0
  9B     FF9B   need to sign extend; you can't just add zeros.
????   1 433B

Note that the 8-bit $9B and the 16-bit $FF9B both represent -101 in their respective number systems.

'''''Lindera''''' is a genus of about 80-100 species of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae, mostly native to eastern Asia but with three species in eastern North America. The species are shrubs and small trees; common names include Spicebush and Benjamin Bush.

One of the world's rarest bee species, the andrenid bee ''[[../Andrena lauracea/]]'' is apparently a specialist on ''Lindera'' (see ''[[../Lindera benzoin/]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck! --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 14:11, 12 April 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== INTRODUCTION ==
Legal issues in instructional technology are becoming more and more relevant as technology becomes more prevalent for delivering instruction. Potential legal issues include but are not limited to, freedom of speech, harassment, privacy, special education, plagiarism, copyright and fair use.

== POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES IN INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY ==

As the profession of Instructional Technology grows and expands in the digital era, there is an increase for potential problem and/or conflict areas. Reiser &amp; Dempsey (2002) enumerate the following issues as possible legal areas of concern:

**Failure to develop and offer training which is mandated by the government can result in litigation initiated by the government.
**Taking material from the internet without getting consent, thereby violating copyright laws or intellectual property rights.
**Lawsuits resulting from comments made or material handed out during a training that are discriminatory (based on age, sex, race, ethnicity, etc).
**The injury of a trainee or employee who received the injury during a training if the training personnel were negligent in providing a safe training environment.
**Injury due to missing or incorrect information received by training materials.
**Possible lawsuits due to employees feeling that they were kept from promotions because they were denied access to the training which is necessary for the promotion.

Richard &amp; Dempsey (2002) conclude that, &quot;although we do not expect designer's to be legal experts, each needs to be aware of general laws (e.g., those pertaining to sexual harassment) and the laws governing specific industries (e.g., those pertaining to the discharge of pollutants).&quot; (p. 207).

== ISTE National Educational Technology Standards for Administrators==

SOCIAL, LEGAL, AND ETHICAL ISSUES.
Educational leaders understand the social, legal, and ethical issues related to technology and model responsible decision-making related to these issues. Educational leaders:
#ensure equity of access to technology resources that enable and empower all learners and educators.
#identify, communicate, model, and enforce social, legal, and ethical practices to promote responsible use of technology.
#promote and enforce privacy, security, and online safety related to the use of technology.
#promote and enforce environmentally safe and healthy practices in the use of technology.
#participate in the development of policies that clearly enforce copyright law and assign ownership of intellectual property developed with district resources. 

These standards can be found on the following website: http://cnets.iste.org/administrators/a_stands.html

Similar standards have been published for teachers. These standards might be important part of legal issues.

== ISTE Educational Technology Standards and Performance Indicators for All Teachers ==

Teachers understand the social,ethical,legal,and human issues surrounding the use of technology in PK-12 schools and apply those principles in practice. Teachers: 

#model and teach legal and ethical practice related to technology use. 
#apply technology resources to enable and empower learners with diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and abilities. 
#identify and use technology resources that affirm diversity 
#promote safe and healthy use of technology resources. 
#facilitate equitable access to technology resources for all students.

      <comment>/* Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) ==
The RAII technique is often used for controlling thread locks in multi-threaded applications.
Another typical example of RAII is file operations, e.g. the C++ standard library's file-streams. An input file stream is opened in the object's constructor, and it is closed upon destruction of the object. Since C++ allows objects to be allocated on the [[w:call stack|stack]], C++'s scoping mechanism can be used to control file access.

With RAII we can use, for instance, Class destructors to guarantee clean up, similar to the ''finally'' keyword in other languages. Doing this automates the task and so avoids errors but gives the freedom not to use it.

RAII is also used (as shown in the example below) to ensure exception safety. RAII makes it possible to avoid resource leaks without extensive use of &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; blocks and is widely used in the software industry.

The ownership of dynamically allocated memory (memory allocated with &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt;) can be controlled with RAII. For this purpose, the C++ Standard Library defines [[w:auto ptr|auto ptr]]. Furthermore, lifetime of shared objects can be managed by a smart pointer with shared-ownership semantics such as &lt;code&gt;boost::shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt; defined in C++ by the [[../Libraries/Boost|Boost library]] or policy based &lt;code&gt;Loki::SmartPtr&lt;/code&gt; from [[w:Loki (C++)|Loki library]].

The following RAII class is a lightweight wrapper to the C standard library file system calls.
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
 #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
 
 // exceptions
 class file_error { } ;
 class open_error : public file_error { } ;
 class close_error : public file_error { } ;
 class write_error : public file_error { } ;
   
 class file
 {
 public:
     file( const char* filename )
         :
         m_file_handle(std::fopen(filename, &quot;w+&quot;))
     {
         if( m_file_handle == NULL )
         {
             throw open_error() ;
         }
     }
   
     ~file()
     {
         std::fclose(m_file_handle) ;
     }
 
     void write( const char* str )
     {
         if( std::fputs(str, m_file_handle) == EOF )
         {
             throw write_error() ;
         }
     }
  
     void write( const char* buffer, std::size_t num_chars )
     {
         if( num_chars != 0
             &amp;&amp;
             std::fwrite(buffer, num_chars, 1, m_file_handle) == 0 )
         {
             throw write_error() ;
         }
     }
 
 private:
     std::FILE* m_file_handle ;
       
     // copy and assignment not implemented; prevent their use by
     // declaring private.
     file( const file &amp; ) ;
     file &amp; operator=( const file &amp; ) ;
 } ;
&lt;/source&gt;

This RAII class can be used as follows :

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void example_with_RAII()
{
  // open file (acquire resource)
  file logfile(&quot;logfile.txt&quot;) ;
   
  logfile.write(&quot;hello logfile!&quot;) ;
  // continue writing to logfile.txt ...
   
  // logfile.txt will automatically be closed because logfile's
  // destructor is always called when example_with_RAII() returns or
  // throws an exception.
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Without using RAII, each function using an output log would have to manage the file explicitly.
For example, an equivalent implementation without using RAII is this:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void example_without_RAII()
{
  // open file
  std::FILE* file_handle = std::fopen(&quot;logfile.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;) ;
 
  if( file_handle == NULL )
  {
    throw open_error() ;
  }
  
  try
  {

    if( std::fputs(&quot;hello logfile!&quot;, file_handle) == EOF )
    {
      throw write_error() ;
    }
  
    // continue writing to logfile.txt ... do not return
    // prematurely, as cleanup happens at the end of this function
  }
  catch(...)
  {
    // manually close logfile.txt
    std::fclose(file_handle) ;
 
    // re-throw the exception we just caught
    throw ;
  }
  
  // manually close logfile.txt 
  std::fclose(file_handle) ;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The implementation of &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;example_without_RAII()&lt;/code&gt; becomes more complex if &lt;code&gt;fopen()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fclose()&lt;/code&gt; could potentially throw exceptions; &lt;code&gt;example_with_RAII()&lt;/code&gt; would be unaffected, however.

The essence of the RAII idiom is that the class &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; encapsulates the management of any finite resource, like the &lt;code&gt;FILE*&lt;/code&gt; file handle. It guarantees that the resource will properly be disposed of at function exit. Furthermore, &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; instances guarantee that a valid log file is available (by throwing an exception if the file could not be opened).

There's also a big problem in the presence of exceptions: in &lt;code&gt;example_without_RAII()&lt;/code&gt;, if more than one resource were allocated, but an exception was to be thrown between their allocations, there's no general way to know which resources need to be released in the final &lt;code&gt;catch&lt;/code&gt; block - and releasing a not-allocated resource is usually a bad thing. RAII takes care of this problem; the automatic variables are destructed in the reverse order of their construction, and an object is only destructed if it was fully constructed (no exception was thrown inside its constructor). So &lt;code&gt;example_without_RAII()&lt;/code&gt; can never be as safe as &lt;code&gt;example_with_RAII()&lt;/code&gt; without special coding for each situation, such as checking for invalid default values or nesting try-catch blocks.  Indeed, it should be noted that &lt;code&gt;example_without_RAII()&lt;/code&gt; contained resource bugs in previous versions of this article.

This frees &lt;code&gt;example_with_RAII()&lt;/code&gt; from explicitly managing the resource as would otherwise be required. When several functions use &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;, this simplifies and reduces overall code size and helps ensure program correctness.

&lt;code&gt;example_without_RAII()&lt;/code&gt; resembles the idiom used for resource management in non-RAII languages such as Java. While Java's ''try-finally'' blocks allow for the correct release of resources, the burden nonetheless falls on the programmer to ensure correct behavior, as each and every function using &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; may explicitly demand the destruction of the log file with a ''try-finally'' block.

Good to see that we have a new editor, and while I understand the idea of &quot;being bold&quot;, might I suggest that perhaps you have misunderstood part of the idea?

This is intended as a textbook. The &quot;Questions&quot; may well be answered already; but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be there. They are there for a reason -- to hopefully inspire thought in the student.

Specifically: The questions under Ron's name are all answered, or many of them. Should they be yanked? No, because if you just skim the text you'll miss the answers; answering the questions sort of requires that you either go back and read the text more thoroughly, or that you already have an encyclopedic knowledge of the series.

Hacking out an entire section with the one-word comment &quot;Bull&quot; is not helpful. You may disagree; feel free to post a contrarian opinion. The Discussion page on that particular article does have some comments about that topic already, IIRC. But the fact that the opinion was placed there means that someone feels it is valid, or at least worth consideration.

Perhaps a good idea would be to consider whose toes you might be stepping on before you get too happy with the deletions. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:31, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:Also, don't take my actions the wrong way. I have no problem with how you started (by adding useful stuff to a good number of pages), and some of MG's pages might indeed need a bit of clean-up; i just put back a few parts that aren't yet decreasing the quality of those pages. When we have a good-enough quality overall, we can cut off the lesser parts. Looking forward to seeing you in action. And do have fun editing. -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 07:30, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:PS If you forget about something you know you edited, you can use the &quot;'''[[Special:Contributions/Therequiembellishere|my Contributions]]'''&quot; link to see if it's in there. Also, maybe you could find it useful to look into using the &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|my WatchList]]&quot; feature. ;) -- [[User:Jokes Free4Me|Jokes Free4Me]] 07:41, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

== Dates ==

I see you've gone and put a bunch of dates in for the dates people did things at Hogwarts. I'm going to suggest that you take those out... because while they are accurate, and we have got dates in the Timelines, that's the only place we have them. And since dates are not actually mentioned in most of the books, it makes a heck of a lot more sense for our readers if the years given in our articles are listed as relative to the books, rather than to the outside world. For instance – Kettleburn was Dangerous Creatures teacher until June 1993, right?  But that doesn't make it obvious that he left at the end of book 2. We've been basically following the same rule throughout... actual calendar dates are not at all important to the series, but dates relative to the books themselves are, so we leave it at &quot;first year&quot; rather than &quot;1991-1992&quot;.

:Granted my reasoning is a little... awkward, but as I got raked over the coals for it in my early days, I feel a little sensitive about it... To restate: You know and I know that Harry's first year starts September 1991, yes? But to the naïve reader, that is not obvious; it does not become apparent until the second book, what year it actually is supposed to be. (And even there, our supposition is wrong; Harry's parents were, by that logic, murdered on Hallowe'en 1981, which is a Saturday, so November 1, the first day in the first book, ought to be a Sunday, yet the book quite clearly states that it is a Tuesday.) JKR plays fast and loose with the dates in a number of other places; most importantly, school always starts on September 2, the Hogwarts Express rolls on September 1, and it seems that September 2 is at least always a week day, and a disproportionate number of times it is a Monday. GoF is at least consistent within itself as to the way days of the week and days of the month line up, but it is not consistent with 1994 / 1995. And I could go on for hours... but the important thing is this: The fact that book 1 largely falls in 1991 and 1992 '''is not''' important to the reader. The fact that it is Harry's first year at Hogwarts '''is''' important. So with the exception of the timelines, where the structure of the timeline generator forces us to put dates on things, the actual physical dates are largely unimportant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Microprocessor Design}}

The current state-of-the-art process for manufacturing processors and small ICs in general is to use '''photolithography'''. Photolithography is a complicated multi-step process.

== Wafers ==

A '''wafer''' is a large circular disk, typically made of doped silicon. Each wafer can hold multiple chips arranged like tiles. The number of chips per wafer is known as the '''yield'''. 

== Basic Photolithography ==

In photolithography, there are typically two important chemicals: an acid and a resist. A photo-negative of the design is exposed to light, and the pattern is projected onto the wafer. Resist is applied to the wafer, and it sticks to the portions of the wafer that are exposed to light. Once the resist is applied to the wafer, it is dipped in the acid. The acid eats away a layer of everything that is not covered in resist. &lt;s&gt;After the top layer has been disolved, the wafer is washed (to remove any remaining acid and resist), and a new layer of doped silicon is applied to the top of the wafer. Once the new layer of silicon has been applied, the process is repeated again.&lt;/s&gt;

The first two applications of resist are used to convert thin, carefully shaped regions of the base silicon wafer into n-type and p-type [[w:doping (semiconductor)]] (no net material is added or taken away after these steps).
''Wait up -- I thought doping occurred after the polysilicon was added? Is that an additional doping stage, or is doping not really the first 2 stages?''

After that, layers of polysilicon, silicon oxide, and metal are added, coating the entire wafer.
After each layer of desired material is added, resist and acid are used to &quot;pattern&quot; the layer, keeping the desired regions and removing the undesired regions of that layer.

== packaging ==

After all the layers specified by the design have been applied, the wafer is &quot;diced&quot; into individual rectangular &quot;die&quot;.
Then each die packaged.

''... does testing happen before the wafer is diced? Before and after? ...''

This is the '''Cheat Sheet''' for the '''[[Russian|Russian for English Speakers]]''' Wikibook. It is intended to be a one page quick guide to the Russian Language, and should serve as a reference to the general text, at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Russian, which is released under the GNU Free Documentation License.

* In most Russian dialects, '''о''' is pronounced as in ''hello'' only when it is stressed. If it comes immediately before the stressed syllable, it is pronounced 'uh', as in ''money''. Otherwise, it is pronounced 'ah', as in ''father''. For example, the word &quot;хорошо&quot; is stressed on the third syllable, so the word is pronounced 'kha-ruh-sho', not 'kho-ro-sho'. Notice that the first &quot;o&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ah&quot;, the second as &quot;uh&quot;, and the third as &quot;oh&quot;. However, if you pronounce ''о'' as 'oh', Russians will still understand you.
* The suffix '''-ого''' is usually pronounced 'ovo', not 'ogo', and '''-его''' is pronounced 'yevo', not 'yego'.
* Consonants can be either hard or soft. They are hard by default, unless followed by the vowels '''я''', '''е''', '''и''', '''ё''', or '''ю''', or the soft-sign '''ь'''. Because of this, consonants rarely need to be made hard, so the hard-sign, '''ъ''', is rarely used. Hard consonants are so called because they're short and brief, whereas soft consonants are just softer versions of their hard counterparts. For example, the hard consonant 't' in the English word ''tank'' is pronounced with the tip of tongue on the ridge of the hard palate - but if you pronounce it with the tip of the tongue on the back of the upper teeth, the 't' sound becomes ''soft''.
* At the end of a word, or before unvoiced consonants (like '''T'''), the following consonants change pronunciation: '''б→п, в→ф, г→к, д→т, ж→ш,''' and '''з→с'''. Notice that these are fairly similar, and since they make for easier pronunciation of the word, they are easy to predict. For example, '''ход''' is pronounced ''khot'', not ''khod''.
* '''Palatalisation''' (or soft consonants) means the letter is pronounced with the middle of the tongue. Ex: Pronounce ''ball'' while holding your tongue.

== Brazilian Portuguese duplication merge proposal ==

Hi there. Back in 2007 it looks like you did a lot of work on the Brazilian Portuguese lessons here: [[Portuguese/Contents/BPL1]]. Later on somebody created a separate [[Brazilian Portuguese]] wikibook, but left your set of lessons in place. I've started a discussion about how we can resolve this duplication: [[Talk:Portuguese/Contents#Separate wikibook Brazilian Portuguese]]

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

      <comment>/* Linking */ Fixed link to term &quot;Translation Unit&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Linker ===
The '''linker''' is a program that makes executable files. The linker resolves linkage issues, such as the use of symbols or identifiers which are defined in one translation unit and are needed from other translation units. Symbols or identifiers which are needed outside a single translation unit have ''external linkage''. In short, the linker's job is to resolve references to undefined symbols by finding out which other object defines a symbol in question, and replacing placeholders with the symbol's address. Of course, the process is more complicated than this; but the basic ideas apply.

Linkers can take objects from a collection called a library. Depending on the library (system or language or external libraries) and options passed, they may only include its symbols that are referenced from other object files or libraries. Libraries for diverse purposes exist, and one or more system libraries are usually linked in by default. We will take a closer look into libraries on the [[C++ Programming/Compiler/Linker/Libraries|Libraries Section]] of this book.

==== Linking ====
The process of connecting or combining object files produced by a compiler with the libraries necessary to make a working executable program (or a library) is called ''linking''. ''Linkage'' refers to the way in which a program is built out of a number of [[w:translation unit (programming)|translation units]]. 

C++ programs can be compiled and linked with programs written in other languages, such as C, Fortran, assembly language, and Pascal.
* The appropriate compiler compiles each module separately. A C++ compiler compiles each &quot;.cpp&quot; file into a &quot;.o&quot; file, an assembler assembles each &quot;.asm&quot; file into a &quot;.o&quot; file, a Pascal compiler compiles each &quot;.pas&quot; file into a &quot;.o&quot; file, etc.
* The linker links all the &quot;.o&quot; files together in a separate step, creating the final executable file.

==== Linkage ====
Every function has either external or internal linkage.

A function with internal linkage is only visible inside one translation unit.
When the compiler compiles a function with internal linkage, the compiler writes the machine code for that function at some address and puts that address in all calls to that function (which are all in that one translation unit), but strips out all mention of that function in the &quot;.o&quot; file.
If there is some call to a function that apparently has internal linkage, but doesn't appear to be defined in this translation unit, the compiler can immediately tell the programmer about the problem (error).
If there is some function with internal linkage that never gets called, the compiler can do &quot;dead code elimination&quot; and leave it out of the &quot;.o&quot; file.

The linker never hears about those functions with internal linkage, so it knows nothing about them.

A function declared with external linkage is visible inside several translation units.
When a compiler compiles a call to that function in one translation unit, it does not have any idea where that function is, so it leaves a placeholder in all calls to that function, and instructions in the &quot;.o&quot; file to replace that placeholder with the address of a function with that name.
If that function is never defined, the compiler can't possibly know that, so the programmer doesn't get a warning about the problem (error) until much later.

When a compiler compiles (the definition of) a function with external linkage (in some other translation unit), the compiler writes the machine code code of that function at some address, and puts that address and the name of the function in the &quot;.o&quot; file where the linker can find it.
The compiler assumes that the function will be called from some other translation unit (some other &quot;.o&quot; file), and must leave that function in this &quot;.o&quot; file, even if it ends up that the function is never called from any translation unit.

Most code conventions specify that header files contain only declarations, not definitions.
Most code conventions specify that implementation files (&quot;.cpp&quot; files) contain only definitions and local declarations, not external declarations.

This results in the &quot;extern&quot; keyword being used only in header files, never in implementation files.
This results in internal linkage being indicated only in implementation files, never in header files.
This results in the &quot;static&quot; keyword being used only in implementation files, never in header files, except when &quot;static&quot; is used inside a class definition inside a header file, where it indicates something other than internal linkage.

We discuss header files and implementation files in more detail later in the [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/C++/Code/File Organization|File Organization Section]] of the book.

The '''Pie Floater''' is a meal consisting of a meat pie served upside down in a dish of pea soup.  It is common in South Australia, and sometimes seen in other parts of Australia. The pie floater is a popular midnight snack for drinkers and revelers.

==Ingredients==
* 1 meat pie (commercial pies are fine)
* 1 can pea soup

==Procedure==
# Heat the Pie in an oven. A microwave will not work as well, as the pie pastry will not be crisp.
# Heat the pea soup separately.
# Place the pie upside down in the dish, and pour the pea soup around it until the dish is full.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__
[[Image:Human skeleton diagram trace.svg|thumb|150px|A diagram of the human skeleton]] The skeleton is the part of our body that allows it to keep its shape. It is made up of hundreds of connected bones, each with a different role. 

An adult skeleton system has 206 bones.
The longest is the thigh bone - femur
The smallest inside the ear - ossicles.

==Functions of the Skeleton==
The skeleton has six main functions:
*Support - the skeleton is the 'frame' which supports the body, allowing us to maintain our shape.
*Attachment - muscles, tendons and ligaments attach to the surface of the bones.
*Movement - skeletal muscles allow us to move around and these are attached to the skeleton by tendons.  If it were not for the skeleton, movement would be much harder and would be very restricted.
*Protection - the skeleton protects most of the vital organs. For example the skull protects the brain and the ribcage protects the lungs and the heart.
*Blood cell production - blood cells are made inside bone marrow, which is found in bones of the skeleton.

==Structure of the Skeleton==
Bones contain blood vessels , nerve cells and living bones. A non-living hard matter of calcium and phosphorous protects these. 

==Skeleton joints==
Joints are the meeting point of bones. These restrict as well as facilitate movement of bones.
Fixed joint , movable joints , ball and socket joints , pivot joints, etc., are different types of joints.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''partitioned matrix''' also called a '''block matrix''' is a partition of a matrix into rectangular smaller matrices called '''blocks'''.

The matrix &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be partitioned into 4 2×2 blocks
:&lt;math&gt;P = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\\
3 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 4\\
3 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_{11} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix},   P_{12} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 2\\
2 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix},  P_{21} = \begin{bmatrix}
3 &amp; 3 \\
3 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix},   P_{22} = \begin{bmatrix}
4 &amp; 4\\
4 &amp; 4\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can write the partitioned matrix like this
:&lt;math&gt;P_{partitioned} = \begin{bmatrix}
P_{11} &amp; P_{12} \\
P_{21} &amp; P_{22} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Re: 
Note: The word &quot;tinggal&quot; is a tricky word. If it is used alone (not conjugated), it means to live or to stay. However, if you conjugate it, it means to leave or to die. Many people got confused on this. Think of it in Indonesian culture perspective. Many indigenous Indonesian believe that when people die, their soul is here to stay.

Correction:
The word &quot;meninggal&quot; which means &quot;to die,&quot; was created because when one dies, he or she departs from this world. Therefore the correct word for &quot;to die&quot; in Indonesian is &quot;meninggal dunia.&quot; Literally it means &quot;to depart from the world.&quot; The colloquial word or slang word for this is &quot;meninggal.&quot;

Example:
# Pandu, panduan, pemandu, memandu.
# Tinggal, tinggalkan, meninggal, meninggalkan.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Diagonal Matrix ==
A '''diagonal matrix''', &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, is a square matrix in which the entries outside of the main diagonal are zero. The '''main diagonal''' of a square matrix consists of the entries which run from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. 

In the example below the main diagonal are &lt;math&gt;a_{11}, a_{22}, ..., a_{nn}\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \quad A=\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; a_{22} &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_{nn}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;


==Identity Matrix==
The identity matrix, with a size of ''n'', is an ''n''-by-''n'' square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It is commonly denoted as &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt;, or simply by ''I'' if the size is immaterial or can be easily determined by the context.
:&lt;math&gt;I_1=[1] \quad I_2=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \quad I_3=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix} \quad I_n=\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The most important property of the identity matrix is that, when multiplied by another matrix, ''A'', the result will be ''A''
:&lt;math&gt;AI_n=A\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_n A=A\,&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''vector space''' is a way of generalizing the concept of a set of [[Linear Algebra/Vectors|vectors]]. For example, the complex number 2+3i can be considered a vector, since in some way it is the vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

The vector space is a &quot;space&quot; of such abstract objects, which we term &quot;vectors&quot;.

== Some familiar friends ==
Currently in our study of vectors we have looked at vectors with real entries: 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R}^3, ..., \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. These are all vector spaces. The advantage we gain in abstracting to vector spaces is a way of talking about a space without any particular choice of objects (which define our vectors), operations (which act on our vectors), or coordinates (which identify our vectors in the space). Further results may be applied to more general spaces which may have infinite dimension, such as in Functional Analysis.

== Notations and concepts==
We write a vector, like we have before, bold, but you should write these on paper underlined or with an arrow on top. So we write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; for that vector.

When we multiply a vector by a scalar number, we usually ascribe it a Greek letter, writing &amp;lambda;'''v''' for the multiplication of '''v''' by a scalar &amp;lambda;. We write addition and subtraction of vectors as we have been doing before, '''x'''+'''y''' for the sum of vectors '''x''' and '''y'''.

With scalar multiplication and adding vectors, we can move to our definition of a vector space.

When we refer to an operation being 'closed' in a definition, we are saying that the result of the operation does not violate our definition.  For example, if we are looking at the set of all integers, we can say that it is closed under addition, because adding any integers results in something inside the set of integers.  However the set of integers is not closed under division, because dividing 3 by 2 (for example) doesn't result in a member of the set of integers.

== Definition==
A ''vector space'' is a nonempty set V of objects, called ''vectors'' on which are defined two operations, called ''vector addition'' and ''scalar multiplication'', respectively,  are defined such that, for &lt;math&gt;x,y\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &amp;alpha;&lt;math&gt; \in F&lt;/math&gt;, '''x'''+'''y''' and &amp;alpha;'''x''' are well defined elements of V with the following properties: 
* ''commutativity of addition'': '''x'''+'''y'''='''y'''+'''x'''
* ''associativity of addition'': '''x'''+('''y'''+'''z''')=('''x'''+'''y''')+'''z'''
* ''additive identity'': there is a vector '''0''' such that '''0'''+'''x'''='''x''' for all '''x'''
* ''additive inverse'': for each vector '''x''', there exists another vector '''y''' such that '''x'''+'''y''' ='''0'''
* ''scalar associativity'': &amp;alpha;(&amp;beta;'''x''') = (&amp;alpha;&amp;beta;)'''x'''
* ''scalar distributivity'': (&amp;alpha; + &amp;beta;)'''x'''=&amp;alpha;'''x'''+&amp;beta;'''x'''
* ''vector distributivity'': &amp;alpha;('''x'''+'''y''')=&amp;alpha;'''x'''+&amp;alpha;'''y'''
* ''scalar identity'': 1'''x'''='''x'''

=== Alternative Definition ===
People who are familiar with [[w:group theory|group theory]] and [[w:field theory (mathematics) |field theory]] may find the following alternative definition more compact:

* &lt;math&gt;(V, +)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[w:Abelian group|Abelian group]].
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha \in F, (\forall x, y \in V), \alpha (x+y) = \alpha x + \alpha y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha, \beta \in F, \forall x\in V, (\alpha + \beta)x = \alpha x + \beta x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha, \beta \in F, \forall x\in V, (\alpha \beta)x = \alpha (\beta x)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in V, 1x = x&lt;/math&gt;

== Subspaces ==
A ''subspace'' is a vector space inside a vector space. When we look at various vector spaces, it is often useful to examine their subspaces. 

The subspace S of a vector space V is that S is a sub''set'' of V and that it has the following key characteristics
* S is closed under scalar multiplication: if &amp;lambda;&amp;isin;'''R''', '''v'''&amp;isin;S, &amp;lambda;'''v'''&amp;isin;S
* S is closed under addition: if '''u''', '''v''' &amp;isin; S,  '''u'''+'''v'''&amp;isin;S.
* S contains '''0''', the zero vector.

Any subset with these characteristics is a subspace.

=== Examples ===
Let us examine some subspaces of some familiar vector spaces, and see how we can prove that a certain subset of a vector space is in fact a subspace.

==== The trivial subspace ====
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the set containing the zero vector ({'''0'''}) is a subspace in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Scalar multiplication closure''': ''a'' '''0'''='''0''' for all ''a'' in '''R'''

'''Addition closure''': '''0'''+'''0'''='''0'''.  Since '''0''' is the only member of the set so we only need to check '''0'''

'''Zero vector''': '''0''' is the only member of the set and it is the zero vector.

==== A slightly less trivial subspace ====
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the set '''V''' of all vectors from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the form (0,&amp;alpha;) where &amp;alpha; is in '''R''' is a subspace

'''Scalar multiplication closure''': ''a'' (0,&amp;alpha;) = (0,a &amp;alpha;) and a &amp;alpha; is in '''R'''

'''Addition closure''': (0,&amp;alpha;) +(0,&amp;beta;) =(0, &amp;alpha; + &amp;beta;) and &amp;alpha; + &amp;beta; is in '''R'''

'''Zero vector''': taking &amp;alpha; to be zero in our definition of (0, &amp;alpha;) in '''V''' we get the zero vector (0,0)

==== A whole family of subspaces ====
Pick any number from '''R''', say &amp;rho;.  Then the set '''V''' of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;, &amp;rho;&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Scalar mation closure''': ''a'' (&amp;alpha;, &amp;rho;&amp;alpha;) = (a&amp;alpha;, &amp;rho;a&amp;alpha;) which is in '''V'''.

'''Addition closure''': (&amp;alpha;, &amp;rho;&amp;alpha;) +(&amp;beta;, &amp;rho;&amp;beta;) =(&amp;alpha; + &amp;beta;, &amp;rho;&amp;alpha; + &amp;rho;&amp;beta;) = (&amp;alpha;+&amp;beta;, &amp;rho;(&amp;alpha;+&amp;beta;)) which  is in '''V'''

'''Zero vector''': taking &amp;alpha; to be zero in our definition we get (0, &amp;rho;0) = (0,0) in '''V'''.

That means '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,2&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,3&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,4&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,5&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,&amp;pi;&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;radic;2&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form 
&lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\sqrt{2}\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

As you can see, even a simple vector space like '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can have many different subspaces.

== Linear Combinations, Spans and Spanning Sets, Linear Dependence, and Linear  ==

=== Linear Combinations ===

Definition: Assume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector space'' over a field &lt;math&gt;(F, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty subset of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Then a vector &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''linear combination''' of elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a finite number of elements &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\in F&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x = a_1y_1 + a_2y_2 + ... a_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Spans ===

Definition: Assume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector space'' over a field &lt;math&gt;(F, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all linear combinations of &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\in V&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''span''' of &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt;. This is sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;Span(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)&lt;/math&gt;. 


Note that &lt;math&gt;Span(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\in V)&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  

Proof: Consider closure under addition and scalar multiplication for two vectors, x and y, in the span of the vectors &lt;math&gt;{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + ... + a_nv_n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = b_1v_1 + b_2v_2 + ... + b_nv_n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x+y = (a_1+b_1)*v_1 + (a_2+b_2)*v_2 + ... + (a_n+b_n)*v_n&lt;/math&gt;, which is also contained in the set.

&lt;math&gt;k*x = (k*a_1)v_1 + (k*a_2)v_2 + ... + (k*a_n)v_n&lt;/math&gt;, which is also contained in the set.


==== Spanning Sets ====

Definition: Assume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector space'' over a field &lt;math&gt;(F, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt; are vectors in such a vector space. The set &lt;math&gt;{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''spanning set''' for the vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every vector in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt;. Alternately, &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in V, (\exists a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\in F), x = a_1y_1 + a_2y_2 + ... +a_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;

=== Linear Independence ===

Definition:  Assume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector space'' over a field &lt;math&gt;(F, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we say &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is linearly independent if &lt;math&gt;a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...a_nx_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Linear independence is a very important topic in Linear Algebra. The definition implies that linearly dependent vectors may form the nulvector as a non-trivial combination, from which we may conclude that one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. 

If we have a vector space V spanned by 3 vectors &lt;math&gt;{v_1, v_2, v_3}&lt;/math&gt; we say that v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly dependent if there is a combination of one or two of them that can produce a third. For instance, if one of the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 = v_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_2v_2 + a_3v_3 = v_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_1v_1 + a_3v_3 = v_2&lt;/math&gt;

can be satisfied, then the vectors in V are said to be '''linearly dependant'''. 

How can we test for linear independence? The definition sets it out to us: If V is a vector space spanned by 3 vectors of length N:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V} = [v_1, v_2, v_3]&lt;/math&gt;

and we try to test whether these 3 vectors are linearly independent, we form the equations:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1v_1+a_2v_2+a_3v_3=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

and solve them. If the only solution is 

:&lt;math&gt;a_1=a_2=a_3=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;

then the 3 vectors are linearly independent. If there is another solution they are linearly dependent.


??????
We can say that for V to be linearly independent it must satisfy this condition:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}\bar{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where we are using 0 to denote the null vector in V.  If &lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}&lt;/math&gt; is square and invertable, we can solve this equation directly:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}^{-1}\tilde{V}\bar{a} = \bar{a} = \tilde{V}^{-1} \cdot 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And if we know that &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/math&gt; is zero, then we know that the system is linearly independent. If, however, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}&lt;/math&gt; is not square, or if it is not invertable, we can try the following technique:

Multiply through by the transpose matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}\bar{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Find the inverse of &lt;math&gt;[\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}&lt;/math&gt;, and multiply through by the inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;[\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}]^{-1}\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}\bar{a} = [\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}]^{-1} \cdot 0&lt;/math&gt;

Cancel the terms:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a} = \tilde{V}^T\tilde{V} \cdot 0&lt;/math&gt;

And our conclusion:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This again means that V is linearly independent.

=== Span ===

A '''span''' is the set of all possible vectors that are in a given vector space. 

===Basis===

A '''basis''' for a vector space is the least amount of linearly independent vectors that can be used to describe the vector space completely. The most common basis vectors are the '''kronecker vectors''', also called '''canonical basis''':

:&lt;math&gt; \hat i = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}\quad ; \quad \hat j = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}\quad ; \quad \hat k = \begin{pmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In the cartesian graphing space, we say an ordered triple of coordinates is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \begin{pmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And we can make any point (x, y, z) by combining the kronecker basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{pmatrix} = x\hat i + y\hat j + z\hat k&lt;/math&gt;

'''Some theorems''':
*A basis &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}(v_1, \ldots, v_n)&lt;/math&gt; of a vector space V has the maximal number of linearly independent vectors.
*(Converse) A maximal number of linearly independent vectors in a vector space is a basis.

== Bases and Dimension ==

If a vector space &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; is such that:&lt;br&gt;
it contains a linearly independent set &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; of N vectors,and&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; set of N + 1 or more vectors in &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; is linearly dependent,&lt;/br&gt;

then &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; is said to have &lt;b&gt;dimension&lt;/b&gt; N, and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; is said to be a   &lt;b&gt;basis&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;.

([http://www.mathematics21.org/formulas-theory.html this article] contains an abstract definition of a ''basis'' which is a generalization of a basis in vector space and can be used as the foundation to explain about bases and coordinate transformations.)

== Matrices == 

[[Image:Matrix.png|thumb|200px|right|Organization of a matrix]]
Informally an ''m''&amp;times;''n'' matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular table of entries from a [[w:Field (mathematics)|field]] (that is to say that each entry is an [[w:Element (mathematics)|element]] of a field). Here m is the number of rows and n the number of the columns in the table. Those unfamiliar with the concept of a field, can for now assume that by a field of characteristic 0 (which we will denote by F) we are referring to a particular subset of the set of [[HSE Complex number|complex numbers]].

An m&amp;times;n matrix (read as m by n matrix), is usually written as:

:&lt;math&gt;A=\left(\begin{matrix}
a_{11}&amp;a_{12}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{1n}\\
a_{21}&amp;a_{22}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{2n}\\
\vdots&amp;\vdots&amp;\ddots&amp;\vdots\\
a_{m1}&amp;a_{m2}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{mn}
\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; row is an element of [[w:Cartesian product|&lt;math&gt;F^n&lt;/math&gt;]], showing the n components &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a_{i1} &amp; a_{i2} &amp;\cdots a_{in} \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Similary the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; column is an element of &lt;math&gt;F^m&lt;/math&gt; showing the m components &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a_{1j}\\a_{2j}\\\vdots\\a_{mj}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Here m and n are called the ''dimensions'' of the matrix. The dimensions of a matrix are always given with the number of rows first, then the number of columns. It is also said that an m by n matrix has an ''order'' of m&amp;times;n. 

Formally, an m&amp;times;n matrix M is a [[w:Function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;M:A\rightarrow F&lt;/math&gt; where A = {1,2...m} [[w:Cartesian product|&amp;times;]] {1,2...n} and F is the field under consideration. It is almost always better to visualize a matrix as a rectangular table (or array) then as a function.

A matrix having only one row is called a ''row matrix'' (or a ''row vector'') and a matrix having only one column is called a ''column matrix'' (or a ''column vector''). Two matrices of the same order whose corresponding entries are equal are considered equal. The (''i'',''j'')-entry of the matrix (often written as &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt;) is the element at the intersection of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; row (from the top) and the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; column (from the left).

For example, 

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 8 \\
                        2 &amp; 7 &amp; 11 \\
                        1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1  \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

is a 3&amp;times;3 matrix (said 3 by 3). The 2nd row is &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}2 &amp; 7 &amp; 11 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and the 3rd column is &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 8\\ 11 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. The (2,3) entry is the entry at intersection of the 2nd row and the 3rd column, that is 11.

Some special kinds of matrices are:

* A ''square matrix'' is a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns. A ''diagonal matrix'' is a matrix with non zero entries only on the main diagonal (ie at &lt;math&gt;A_{i,i}&lt;/math&gt; positions).

* The ''unit matrix'' or ''identity matrix'' I&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, is the matrix with elements on the diagonal set to 1 and all other elements set to 0. Mathematically, we may say that for the identity matrix &lt;math&gt;I_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; (which is usually written as &lt;math&gt;\delta_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; and called [[w:Kronecker's delta|Kronecker's delta]]) is given by: &lt;math&gt; \delta_{i,j} = 
\begin{cases} 
  1, &amp; i=j \\
  0, &amp; i \neq j 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if ''n'' = 3:
: &lt;math&gt;
  I_3 =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}
.&lt;/math&gt;

* The ''transpose'' of an m-by-n matrix A is the n-by-m matrix A&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; formed by turning rows into columns and columns into rows, i.e. &lt;math&gt;A_{i,j} = A^T_{j,i} \forall i,j&lt;/math&gt;. An example is &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 \\
3 &amp; 4 \\
5 &amp; 6 \end{bmatrix}^{\mathrm{T}}  \!\! \;\!
= \,
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5\\
2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 \end{bmatrix} \;
&lt;/math&gt;

*A square matrix whose transpose is equal to itself is called a ''symmetric matrix''; that is, A is symmetric if &lt;math&gt;A^{\mathrm{T}} = A.\,&lt;/math&gt;. An example is &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\\
2 &amp; 4 &amp; -5\\
3 &amp; -5 &amp; 6\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

*A square matrix whose transpose is equal to its negative is called ''skew-symmetric matrix''; that is, A is skew-symmetric if &lt;math&gt;A^{\mathrm{T}} = -A.\,&lt;/math&gt;. An example is &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; -3 &amp; 4\\
3 &amp; 0 &amp; -5\\
-4 &amp; 5 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Properties of these matrices are developed in the exercises.

==Determinants==

To define a determinant of order n, suppose there are n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; elements of a field s&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; where i and j are less than or equal to n. Define the following function (this function is important in the definition):

S(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,...,a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)=# of reversals, meaning the number of times a&lt;sub&gt;n1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;a&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; when n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, for each possible combination.

Suppose you have a permutation of numbers from 1 to n {a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,...,a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). Then define a term of the determinant to be equal to (-1)&lt;sup&gt;S(a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,...,a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sub&gt;1a1&lt;/sub&gt;,s&lt;sub&gt;2a2&lt;/sub&gt;,s&lt;sub&gt;3a3&lt;/sub&gt;,...,s&lt;sub&gt;nan&lt;/sub&gt;. The sum of all possible terms (i. e. through all possible permutations) is called the determinant.

==Theorem==
Definition: The transpose of a matrix A, A&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the matrix resulting when the columns and rows are interchanged i. e. the matrix s&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt; when A is the matrix s&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;
A matrix and its [[transpose]] have the same determinant:
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A^\top) = \det(A). \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
All terms are the same, and the signs of the terms are also unchanged since all reversals remain reversals. Thus, the sum is the same.

==Theorem==
Interchanging two rows (or columns) changes the sign of the determinant:
:&lt;math&gt;\det \begin{bmatrix} \cdots \\ \mbox{row A} \\ \cdots \\ \mbox{row B} \\ \cdots \end{bmatrix} = - \det \begin{bmatrix}\cdots \\ \mbox{row B} \\ \cdots \\ \mbox{row A} \\ \cdots \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof===
To show this, suppose two adjacent rows (or columns) are interchanged. Then any reversals in a term would not be affected except for the reversal of the elements of that term within that row (or column), in which case adds or subtracts a reversal, thus changing the signs of all terms, and thus the sign of the matrix. Now, if two rows, the a&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row and the (a+n)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; are interchanged, then interchange successively the a&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row and (a+1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row, and then the (a+1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row and (a+2)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row, and continue in this fashion until one reaches the (a+n-1)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row. Then go backwards until one goes back to the a&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row. This has the same effect as switching the a&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; row and the (a+n)&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; rows, and takes n-1 switches for going forwards, and n-2 switches for going backwards, and their sum must then be an odd number, so it multiplies by -1 an odd number of times, so that its total effect is to multiply by -1.

===Corollary===
A determinant with two rows (or columns) that are the same has the value 0.
Proof: This determinant would be the additive inverse of itself since interchanging the rows (or columns) does not change the determinant, but still changes the sign of the determinant. The only number for which it is possible is when it is equal to 0.

==Theorem==
It is linear on the rows and columns of the matrix.
:&lt;math&gt;\det \begin{bmatrix}  \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ldots \\ \lambda a_1 + \mu b_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; \lambda a_n + \mu b_n \\   \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix} = \lambda \det \begin{bmatrix}  \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots \\ a_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_n \\   \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix} + \mu \det \begin{bmatrix}  \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots \\  b_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_n \\   \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
===Proof===
The terms are of the form a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...&lt;math&gt;\lambda a + \mu b&lt;/math&gt;...a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the distributive law of fields, this comes out to be a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...&lt;math&gt;\lambda a&lt;/math&gt;...a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...&lt;math&gt;\mu b&lt;/math&gt;...a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, an thus its sum of such terms is the sum of the two determinants:

&lt;math&gt;\lambda \det \begin{bmatrix}  \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots \\ a_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; a_n \\   \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix} + \mu \det \begin{bmatrix}  \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots \\  b_1 &amp; \cdots &amp; b_n \\   \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Corollary===
Adding a row (or column) times a number to another row (or column) does not affect the value of a determinant.

====Proof====
Suppose you have a determinant A with the k&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; column added by another column times a number:
&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}  a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1k}+\mu a_{1b} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2k}+\mu a_{2b} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3k}+\mu a_{3b} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\  a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nk}+\mu a_{nb} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where a&lt;sub&gt;kb&lt;/sub&gt; are elements of another column. By the linear property, this is equal to 

&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}  a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1k} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2k} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3k} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\  a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nk} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} \end{bmatrix} +  \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; \mu a_{1b} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; \mu a_{2b} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; \mu a_{3b} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\  a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; \mu a_{nb} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The second number is equal to 0 because it has two columns that are the same. Thus, it is equal to &lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix}  a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1k} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{1n} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2k} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{2n} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3k} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{3n} \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\  a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; a_{n3} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nk} &amp; \ldots &amp; a_{nn}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the same as the matrix A.




*It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\det(rI_n) = r^n \,&lt;/math&gt; and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\det(rA) = \det(rI_n \cdot A) = r^n \det(A) \,&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; matrices &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and all [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

*A matrix over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'' is invertible if and only if its determinant is a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]] in ''R''.  In particular, if ''A'' is a matrix over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] such as the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s, then ''A'' is invertible if and only if det(''A'') is not zero. In this case we have

:&lt;math&gt;\det(A^{-1}) = \det(A)^{-1}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Expressed differently: the vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] if and only if det(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is non-zero.

The determinants of
a complex matrix and of its [[conjugate transpose]]
are [[Complex conjugate|conjugate]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\det(A^*) = \det(A)^*. \,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Orthogonality ==

=== Cauchy-Schwarz inequality ===

The Cauchy-Schwartz inequality states that the magnitude of the inner product of two vectors is less than or equal to the product of the vector norms, or:
&lt;math&gt;| \langle x,y \rangle |  \le  \| x \| \| y \| &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Definition ===

For any vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in an inner product space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and denote it by &lt;math&gt;x \bot y&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y \rangle =0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Orthogonal complement and matrix transpose ===

=== Applications ===

==== Linear least squares ====

==== How to orthogonalize a basis ====
Suppose to be on a vector space V with a scalar product (not necessarily positive-definite), 
&lt;br&gt;
'''Problem:''' Construct an orthonormal basis of ''V'' starting by a random basis ''{'' ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''}''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An n-by-n matrix A is the inverse of n-by-n matrix B (and B the inverse of A) if BA = AB = I,
where I is an identity matrix.

The inverse of an n-by-n matrix can be calculated by creating an n-by-2n matrix which has the original matrix on the left and the identity matrix on the right.  Row reduce this matrix and the right half will be the inverse.  If the matrix does not row reduce completely (i.e., a row is formed with all zeroes as its entries), it does not have an inverse.


== Example ==
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 4 &amp; 4\\
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 8\\ 
  3 &amp; 6 &amp; 9
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We begin by expanding and partitioning A to include the identity matrix, and then proceed to row reduce A until we reach the identity matrix on the left-hand side.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 &amp; \big| &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\
  2 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 &amp; \big| &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;0\\ 
  3 &amp; 6 &amp; 9 &amp; \big| &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;1
\end{bmatrix}

\rightsquigarrow

\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 &amp; \big| &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\
  0 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; \big| &amp; -2 &amp; 1 &amp;0\\ 
  0 &amp; -6 &amp; -3 &amp; \big| &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp;1
\end{bmatrix}

\rightsquigarrow

\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 4 &amp; 4 &amp; \big| &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \big| &amp; 2/3 &amp; -1/3 &amp;0\\ 
  0 &amp; -6 &amp; -3 &amp; \big| &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp;1
\end{bmatrix}

\rightsquigarrow

&lt;/math&gt;
 
 
:&lt;math&gt;

\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; \big| &amp; -5/3 &amp; 4/3 &amp;0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \big| &amp; 2/3 &amp; -1/3 &amp;0\\ 
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 &amp; \big| &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp;1
\end{bmatrix}

\rightsquigarrow

\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; \big| &amp; -5/3 &amp; 4/3 &amp;0\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \big| &amp; 2/3 &amp; -1/3 &amp;0\\ 
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \big| &amp; -1/3 &amp; 2/3 &amp;-1/3
\end{bmatrix}

\rightsquigarrow

\begin{bmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \big| &amp; -1/3 &amp; -4/3 &amp;4/3\\
  0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \big| &amp; 2/3 &amp; -1/3 &amp;0\\ 
  0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \big| &amp; -1/3 &amp; 2/3 &amp;-1/3
\end{bmatrix}


&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
  -1/3 &amp; -4/3 &amp; 4/3\\
  2/3 &amp; -1/3 &amp; 0\\ 
  -1/3 &amp; 2/3 &amp; -1/3
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; is then the inverse of the original matrix A.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Recall that in your study of vectors, we looked at an operation known as the ''dot product'', and that if we have two vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, we simply multiply the components together and sum them up. With the dot product, it becomes possible to introduce important new ideas like length and angle.  The lenght of a vector,&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;, is just &lt;math&gt;||\mathbf{a}||=\sqrt{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;.  The angle between two vectors,&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the dot product by 

&lt;math&gt;\cos{\theta} = \frac{\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}} {||\mathbf{a}||||\mathbf{b}||}&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that only a few properties of the dot product are necessary to define similar ideas in vector spaces other than '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, such as the spaces of &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices, or polynomials.  The more general operation that will take the place of the dot product in these other spaces is called the &quot;inner product&quot;.  
== The inner product ==
Say we have two vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}=\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{b}=\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 3 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If we want to take their dot product, we would work as follows
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = a_1b_1+a_2b_2+a_3b_3 = (2)(6)+(1)(3)+(4)(0) = 15&lt;/math&gt;

Because in this case multiplication is commutative, we then have '''''a'''''&amp;middot;'''''b''''' = '''''b''''' &amp;middot; '''''a'''''.

But then, we observe that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}\cdot(\alpha\mathbf{a}+\beta\mathbf{b}) = \alpha\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{a} + \beta\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
much like the regular algebraic equality ''v''(''aA''+''bB'')=''avA''+''bvB''.
For regular dot products this is true since, for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, for example, one can expand both sides out to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(\alpha v_1a_1+\beta v_1b_1)+(\alpha v_2a_2+\beta v_2b_2)+(\alpha v_2a_2+\beta v_2b_2)=\\
(\alpha v_1a_1+\alpha v_2a_2+\alpha v_3a_3)+(\beta v_1b_1+\beta v_2b_2+\beta v_3+b_3)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, we can notice that '''''v'''''&amp;middot;'''''v''''' is always positive or greater than zero - checking this for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; gives this as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v}=v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2&lt;/math&gt;
which can never be less than zero since a real number squared is positive. Note that '''''v'''''&amp;middot;'''''v''''' = 0 if and only if '''''v''''' = '''0'''.

In generalizing this sort of behaviour, we want to keep these three behaviours. We can then move on to a definition of a generalization of the dot product, which we call the ''inner product''. An inner product of two vectors in some vector space ''V'', written &lt; '''''x''''', '''''y''''' &gt; is a function that maps ''V''&amp;times;''V'' to '''R''', which obeys the property that
* &lt; '''''x''''', '''''y''''' &gt; = &lt; '''''y''''', '''''x''''' &gt;
* &lt; '''''v''''', &amp;alpha;'''''a'''''+&amp;beta;'''''b''''' &gt; = &amp;alpha; &lt; '''''v''''', '''''a''''' &gt; + &amp;beta; &lt; '''''v''''', '''''b''''' &gt;
* &lt; '''''a''''', '''''a''''' &gt; &amp;ge; 0, &lt; '''''a''''', '''''a''''' &gt; = 0 iff '''''a''''' = '''0'''.

The vector space ''V'' and some inner product together are known as an ''inner product space''. 

&lt;!--
=== Examples ===
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt; '''''x''''' , '''''y''''' &gt; =  --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Many of the problems you will solve in Linear Algebra require that a matrix be converted into one of two forms, the Row Echelon Form  (&lt;i&gt;ref&lt;/i&gt;) and its stricter variant the Reduced Row Echelon Form  (&lt;i&gt;rref&lt;/i&gt;) .  These two forms will help you see the structure of what a matrix represents. If the matrix represents a system of linear equations, these forms allow one to write the solutions to the system.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every Computer Algebra System and most scientific or graphing calculators have commands which produce these forms for any matrix. The commands are often of the form &lt;i&gt;rref(A)&lt;/i&gt;, for example.

== The Row Echelon Form ==
A rectangular matrix is in '''row echelon form''' if it has the following three properties:
* All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros
* Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it
* All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros
* The first nonzero number in any row is a 1

This matrix is in row echelon form:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;&amp; 1 &amp;&amp; 3 &amp;&amp; 3\\ 0 &amp;&amp; 1 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 4 \\ 0 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== The Reduced Row Echelon Form ==
If a matrix in echelon form satisfies the following additional conditions, then it is in '''reduced row echelon form''':
* The matrix is in row-echelon form
* Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column
&lt;br&gt;
This matrix is in reduced row echelon form:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 0\\ 0 &amp;&amp; 1 &amp;&amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp;&amp; 0  &amp;&amp;1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and the &lt;i&gt;rref&lt;/i&gt; of the matrix in the previous section is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 3&amp;&amp;0\\ 0 &amp;&amp; 1 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp;0\\ 0 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp; 0 &amp;&amp;1 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt; How to proceed from a matrix to a reduced row form is explained below.

== Changing A Matrix Into REF Or RREF Form ==
A [[Linear Algebra/Systems of Linear Equations|system of linear equations]] can be solved by reducing its augmented matrix into reduced echelon form. 

A matrix can be changed to its '''reduced row echelon form''', or '''row reduced''' to its '''reduced row echelon form''' using the '''elementary row operations'''. These are:
# Interchange one row of the matrix with another of the matrix.
# Multiply one row of the matrix with a scalar constant.
# Replace the one row with the one row plus a constant times another row of the matrix.

For example, given the following linear system with corresponding augmented matrix:
&lt;p style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;math&gt;       3x_2 -  6x_3 + 6x_4 + 4x_5 = -5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x_1 - 7x_2 +  8x_3 - 5x_4 + 8x_5 =  9&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x_1 - 9x_2 + 12x_3 - 9x_4 + 6x_5 = 15&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 3 &amp; -6 &amp; 6 &amp; 4 &amp; -5 \\ 3 &amp; -7 &amp; 8 &amp; -5 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ 3 &amp; -9 &amp; 12 &amp; -9 &amp; 6 &amp; 15 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
To solve this system, the matrix has to be reduced into reduced echelon form.

'''Step 1:''' Switch row 1 and row 3. All leading zeros are now below non-zero leading entries.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; -9 &amp; 12 &amp; -9 &amp; 6 &amp; 15 \\ 3 &amp; -7 &amp; 8 &amp; -5 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; -6 &amp; 6 &amp; 4 &amp; -5 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 2:''' Set row 2 to row 2 plus (-1) times row 1. In other words, subtract row 1 from row 2. This will eliminate the first entry of row 2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; -9 &amp; 12 &amp; -9 &amp; 6 &amp; 15 \\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; -4 &amp; 4 &amp; 2 &amp; -6 \\ 0 &amp; 3 &amp; -6 &amp; 6 &amp; 4 &amp; -5 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 3:''' Multiply row 2 by 3 and row 3 by 2. This will eliminate the first entry of row 3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; -9 &amp; 12 &amp; -9 &amp; 6 &amp; 15 \\ 0 &amp; 6 &amp; -12 &amp; 12 &amp; 6 &amp; -18 \\ 0 &amp; 6 &amp; -12 &amp; 12 &amp; 8 &amp; -10 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 4:''' Set row 3 to row 3 plus (-1) times row 2. In other words, subtract row 2 from row 3. This will eliminate the second entry of row 3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; -9 &amp; 12 &amp; -9 &amp; 6 &amp; 15 \\ 0 &amp; 6 &amp; -12 &amp; 12 &amp; 6 &amp; -18 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 8 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Step 5:&lt;/b&gt; Multiply each row by the reciprocal of its first non-zero value. This will make every row start with a 1.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 4 &amp; -3 &amp; 2 &amp; 5 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix is now in ''row echelon form'': All nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros (there are no zero rows), each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it and all entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros.

As can and will be shown later, from this form one can observe that the system has infinitely many solutions. To get those solutions, the matrix is further reduced into ''reduced echelon form''.

'''Step 6:''' Set row 2 to row 2 plus (-1) times row 3 and row 1 to row 1 plus (-2) times row 3. This will eliminate the entries above the leading entry of row 3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -3 &amp; 4 &amp; -3 &amp; 0 &amp; -3 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; -7 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Step 7:''' Set row 1 to row 1 plus 3 times row 2. This eliminates the entry above the leading entry of row 2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; -2 &amp; 3 &amp; 0 &amp; -24 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; -2 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; -7 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a ''reduced echelon form'', since the leading entry in each nonzero row is 1 and each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.

From this the solution of the system can be read:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x_1 - 2x_3 + 3x_4 = -24&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x_2 - 2x_3 + 2x_4 = -7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x_5 = 4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Those equations can be solved for &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_5&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x_1 = 2x_3 - 3x_4 -24&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x_2 = 2x_3 - 2x_4 -7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x_5 = 4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the solution of the system. The variables &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_4&lt;/math&gt; can take any value and are so called '''free variables'''. The solution is valid for any &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_4&lt;/math&gt;.

== Understanding The Two Forms ==
Any nonzero matrix may be '''row reduced''' into more than one matrix in echelon form, by using different sequences of row operations. However, no matter how one gets to it, the '''reduced row echelon form''' of every matrix is unique.


&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
! '''''Theorem 1: Uniqueness of the Reduced Echelon Form'''''
|-
| Each matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon matrix
|}
&lt;/center&gt;


If matrix ''A'' is row equivalent to an echelon matrix ''B'', we call matrix ''B'' an echelon form of ''A'', if ''B'' is in reduced echelon form, we call ''B'' the reduced echelon form of ''A''.

== Pivot Positions ==
A '''pivot position''' in a matrix ''A'' is a location in ''A'' that corresponds to a leading 1 in the reduced echelon form of ''A''. A '''pivot column''' is a column of ''A'' that contains a pivot position.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{merge|Perl_Programming/Scalar_Variables}}
{{prognav|Perl|First Programs|Strings}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In perl there are five different types of variables, each indicated by its own sigil character: scalars($), arrays(@), hashes(%), subroutines(&amp;), and typeglobals(*). We first introduce scalars, they are the easiest to understand.

== Scalar Variables ==
Although they have a complicated name, a scalar variable is just a way of storing a value for use later. For example, consider:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

print &quot;Hello John.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

If we wanted to change the name of the user, we can just change the string. However if this program were hundreds of lines long and the name was used several times, trying to find the strings throughout the program would be more fuss than it was worth. Instead, it is common to use variables for any values that might change.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

my $firstname = &quot;John&quot;;

print &quot;Hello $firstname.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

This new program gives exactly the same output as the previous one. There are several new things about this program, the most obvious being the line

*&lt;code&gt;my $firstname = &quot;John&quot;;&lt;/code&gt;
**'''my''' Tells the perl interpreter to give you a new variable. Technically, this is optional but highly recommended.
**'''$firstname''' Tells the perl interpreter that you want a scalar variable called ''firstname''
**'''= &quot;John&quot;''' Tells the perl interpreter that every time you use ''$firstname'' you want it to use the ''string'' John.

While using variables to contain information that you have programmed is all very well, variables are used to store data that can change while your program runs, as their name implies.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

my $firstname = &quot;Jonathan&quot;;
print &quot;Hello $firstname.\n&quot;;

$firstname = &quot;John&quot;;
print &quot;Goodbye $firstname.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

You should notice that when we change the value of &lt;tt&gt;$firstname&lt;/tt&gt; we do not need to use the &lt;tt&gt;my&lt;/tt&gt; operator. This is because we have already told perl to give us the variable, and it is now ours to do what we wish with.

== Numbers ==
Now, while strings are very useful, there is a place in computer programs for numbers as well. A scalar variable can contain either a number or a string.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl
 
my $age = 17;

print &quot;Hello $age year old.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Perl does not provide any easy way of telling the type of information stored in a scalar variable.  Indeed, if you give Perl a string and ask it to do number operation, Perl will automatically convert the string into the number; and vice versa.  Here is an example:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

my $x = 10;
my $y = $x + 1;

print &quot;Using a number $x + 1 = $y.\n&quot;;

$x = &quot;10&quot;;
$y = $x + 1;

print &quot;Using a string $x + 1 = $y.\n&quot;;

$x = &quot;ten&quot;;
$y = $x + 1;

print &quot;Using an English word, $x + 1 = $y.\n&quot;;

$x = &quot;2ten&quot;;
$y = $x + 1;

print &quot;Using a funny string, $x + 1 = $y.\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you run this program, you can see that both the first two examples result in 11 being stored to $y.  Perl does not convert English words to numbers, though, and if you give a string like &quot;ten&quot; it will not turn it to 10, but instead just think it is 0.  The last example shows that it actually tries to understand the string as a number, and stop whenever it find something it doesn't understand.

== Raw Printing ==
It is of course possible to output variables without including them in a string. 

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl

my $forename = &quot;John&quot;;
my $message = &quot;Hello &quot;;

print $message;
print $forename;
print &quot;\n&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exercises ==

      <comment>/* The autoregressive model */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are times, especially in time-series data, that the [[Econometric Theory/Classical Normal Linear Regression Model (CNLRM)|CLR]] assumption of &lt;math&gt; corr(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1})=0 &lt;/math&gt; is broken. This is known in econometrics as '''Serial Correlation''' or '''Autocorrelation'''. This means that &lt;math&gt; corr(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1}) \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt; and there is a pattern across the error terms. The error terms are then not independently distributed across the observations and are not ''strictly'' random.


==Examples of Autocorrelation==
&lt;math&gt; corr(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1})&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Autocorrelation 1.JPG|thumb|400px|left|Positive Autocorrelation]]




&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; corr(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1})&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Autocorrelation 2.JPG|thumb|400px|left|Negative Autocorrelation]]


&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
==Functional Form==
When the error term is related to the previous error term, it can be written in an algebraic equation.
&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_t = \rho \epsilon_{t-1} + u_t &lt;/math&gt; where ρ is the autocorrelation coefficient between the two disturbance terms, and u is the disturbance term for the autocorrelation. This is known as an '''Autoregressive Process.'''
&lt;math&gt;-1&lt; \rho = corr(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1}) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
The u is needed within the equation because although the error term is less random, it still has a slight random effect.  

===Serial Correlation of the Nth Order===
====Autoregressive model====
*First order Autoregressive Process, '''AR(1)''':&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_t = \rho \epsilon_{t-1} + u_t &lt;/math&gt; 
**This is known as the first order autoregression, due to the error term only depending on the previous error term.
*nth order Autoregressive Process, '''AR(n)''':&lt;math&gt; \epsilon_t = \rho_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \rho_2 \epsilon_{t-2} + \cdots + \rho_n \epsilon_{t-n} + u_t &lt;/math&gt;

====Moving-average model====
The notation MA(''q'') refers to the moving average model of order ''q'':

:&lt;math&gt; X_t = \mu + \varepsilon_t + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i \varepsilon_{t-i}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where the θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., θ&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; are the parameters of the model, μ is the expectation of &lt;math&gt;X_t&lt;/math&gt; (often assumed to equal 0), and the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt;,... are again, [[white noise]] error terms. The moving-average model is essentially a [[finite impulse response]] filter with some additional interpretation placed on it.

==== Autoregressive–moving-average model ====

The notation ARMA(''p'', ''q'') refers to the model with ''p'' autoregressive terms and ''q'' moving-average terms. This model contains the AR(''p'') and MA(''q'') models,

:&lt;math&gt; X_t = c + \varepsilon_t +  \sum_{i=1}^p \varphi_i X_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i \varepsilon_{t-i}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Causes of Autocorrelation==
#Spatial Autocorrelation
&lt;math&gt; corr(\epsilon_t, \epsilon_{t-1}) \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt;
Spatial Autocorrelation occurs when the two errors are specially and/or geographically related. In simpler terms, they are &quot;next to each.&quot; 
'''Examples:''' The city of St. Paul has a spike of crime and so they hire additional police. The following year, they found that the crime rate decreased significantly. Amazingly, the city of Minneapolis, which had not adjusted its police force, finds that they have a increase in the crime rate over the same period. 
*Note: this type of Autocorrelation occurs over cross-sectional samples.
#Inertia/Time to Adjust
##This often occurs in Macro, time series data. The US interest rate unexpectedly increases and so there is an associated change in exchange rates with other countries. Reaching a new equilibrium could take some time. 
#Prolonged Influences
##This is again a Macro, time series issue dealing with economic shocks. It is now expected that the US interest rate will increase. ##The associated exchange rates will slowly adjust up-until the announcement by the Federal Reserve and may overshoot the equilibrium. 
#Data Smoothing/Manipulation
##Using functions to smooth data will bring autocorrelation into the disturbance terms
#Misspecification
##A regression will often show signs of autocorrelation when there are omitted variables. Because the missing independent variable now exists in the disturbance term, we get a disturbance term that looks like: &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_t = \beta_2 X_2 + u_t &lt;/math&gt; when the correct specification is &lt;math&gt; Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + u_t &lt;/math&gt;

==Consequences of Autocorrelation==
The main problem with autocorrelation is that it may make a model ''look'' better than it actually is. 
===List of consequences===
#Coefficients are still unbiased &lt;math&gt;E(\epsilon_t) = 0, cov(X_t, u_t) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; 
#True variance of &lt;math&gt; \hat{\beta} &lt;/math&gt; is increased, by the presence of autocorrelation. 
# Estimated variance of &lt;math&gt; \hat{\beta} &lt;/math&gt; is smaller due to autocorrelation (biased downward).
# A decrease in &lt;math&gt; se(\hat{\beta}) &lt;/math&gt; and an increase of the t-statistics; this results in the estimator looking more accurate than it actually is. 
# R² becomes inflated.

All of these problems result in hypothesis tests becoming invalid.

[[Image:AC(1).GIF|thumb|400px|Autocorrelation in data. 2 runs, but the real OLS, which we would have never found, is somewhere in the middle.]]

==Testing for Autocorrelation==
# While not conclusive, an impression can be gained by viewing a graph of the dependent variable against the error term (namely, a residual scatter-plot).
# Durbin-Watson test:
## Assume &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_t = \epsilon_{t-1} \rho + u_t &lt;/math&gt;
## Test H(0): ρ = 0 (no AC) against H(1): ρ &gt; 0 (one-tailed test)
## Test statistic &lt;math&gt; DW = \frac{\sum (\epsilon_t - \epsilon_{t-1})^2} {\sum \epsilon^2} = 2 - 2 \rho &lt;/math&gt;
* Any value under D(L) (in the D-W table) rejects the null hypothesis and AC exists. 
* Any value between D(L) and D(W) leaves us with no conclusion of AC.
* Any value larger than D(W) accepts the null hypothesis and AC does not exist.
[[Image:D-W.GIF|Thumb|400px|The Durbin-Watson distribution]]
*Note, this is one tail test. To get the other tail. Use 4 - DW as the test stat instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The first thing that comes to mind about the Gulf Coast region is precisely that; the coast along the Gulf of Mexico. And no wonder, since there are more than 624 miles of coastline stretching southward from the Louisiana border to the Mexican border near Brownsville.

----
The warm water of the Gulf beckons visitors who want to swim, fish, sail, sunbathe, build sand castles, surf or just take a relaxing stroll on the beach.

----
Searching for some solitude? Look no further than the North Padre National Seashore - which has the longest undeveloped stretch of barrier-island beach in the world - or, if you prefer to be where the action is, join the crowds and party-like atmosphere up and down the coast during Spring Break, or in Galveston and Port Arthur during Mardi Gras.

----
Get up early in the morning to cast lines off a pier or head into the Gulf for some deep-sea fishing. Spend the afternoon lying on a beach enjoying the warmth of the sun and listening to the lulling sound of the waves breaking on the sand. Take a walk along the sand as the sun sets, enjoying the peace of day’s end as sunbeams make their final plays across the water. In the evening, head out to a local waterside restaurant to enjoy fresh seafood and the dark ripple of the waves at night. 

----
However, the Gulf Coast is not just about the sand and surf. From the sun-kissed valley near the Texas-Mexico border to the swamps in Orange, and everything in between, the region has something that appeals to every kind of traveler. 

----
If you enjoy wildlife watching, you’ve definitely come to the right place. The Rio Grande Valley is the nation’s number one bird-watching destination, and most of the Texas Coastal Birding Trail stops fall within this portion of the state. Some of the birding opportunities include seeing tropical birds in Harlingen, stopping at the Matagorda County Birding Nature Center, Paradise Pond Birding Habitat or Los Ebanos Nature Preserve, catching glimpses of the endangered whooping crane that winter at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, and visiting Rockport-Fulton in September for the Hummer/Bird Celebration to see the migrating hummingbirds. 
----
For history buffs, travel back to a different time in Texas with a visit to one of many sites of profound historical importance. Visit the San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site in Deer Park, where Texas avenged its Alamo defeat and won its independence from Mexico. See Spindletop in Beaumont, which set off the oil boom in Texas in 1901 and brought in the modern era of petroleum production. 
----
For museum lovers, the region is rich with art museums, heritage museums, and historic homes and buildings that preserve history. Tour homes, mansions and plantations, and see examples of everyday life and culture in the 1800s and early 1900s. Houston’s museum district is ranked among the five best in the nation, and its Museum of Fine Arts is the sixth largest in the country. 
----
With Texas’ largest city, Houston, and its surrounding metropolitan area, along with Corpus Christi, Brownsville, Harlingen, Port Arthur, Beaumont, the Brazosport Area and Bay Area Houston, there are plenty of opportunities for people who want for modern day activities like shopping, visiting art museums, attending theatrical performances, splashing around at water parks, and enjoying rides at amusement parks. For a truly out-of-this-world experience, visit NASA/ Space Center Houston and have some fun learning about our nation’s space program. 

----
With so much to see and do here, it might be hard to decide where to start, but you don’t want to miss a thing. So, whether you are a beach or water fan, history buff or living for the present, urbanite or nature-lover, the Gulf Coast has something  for you to enjoy!

==1. What is the main purpose of a seed? ==
The main purpose of a seed is to grow a new plant, thus propagating the species.

==2. What foods were first given to man in the Garden of Eden? ==
''Then God said, &quot;I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.'' Genesis 1:29
==3. Identify from a seed or drawing and know the purpose of each of these parts of a seed: seed coat, cotyledon, embryo. ==
[[Image:Salix scouleriana.seed.jpg|thumb|250px|Parts of a seed]]

* '''Seed Coat''' - The ''seed coat'' is the covering which encloses the seed (small embryonic plant, usually with some stored food).
* '''[[W:Cotyledon|Cotyledon]]''' - This is a significant part of the embryo within the seed of a plant. Upon germination, the ''cotyledon'' becomes the embryonic first leaves of a seedling.
* '''Embryo''' - A seed embryo includes the cotyledon which becomes the plant's first leaves, the epicotyl (not shown), which becomes the shoot above the leaves, the hypocotyl which becomes the plant's stem, and the radicle which becomes the plant's root.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

==4. List from memory four different methods by which seeds are scattered. Name three kinds of plants whose seeds are scattered by each method. ==

===Gravity===
The effect of gravity on the dispersal of seeds and spores is straightforward.  Heavier seeds will tend to drop downward from the parent plant, and not by themselves travel very far.  Spores, being much lighter, are more influenced by physical movements in the environment, especially those of wind and water, and therefore less strictly subject to the simple motion of gravity (see examples below). Gravity may be sufficient agent for plants growing on steep slopes, but upslope movement of a population can be a problem. The naked seeds of gymnosperms are largely dependent upon gravity for dispersal. Most conifers are long-lived large shrubs or tall trees, thus taking full advantage of gravitational dispersal and allowing for gradual upslope movement of a population. Dispersal of seeds &quot;strictly&quot; by gravity should not overlook storm effects: seeds from a deteriorating cone growing high on a tall, narrow tree will get spread widely during a wind storm (see &quot;Wind&quot; below).    

Encasing seeds in a rounded fruit promotes gravity driven movement away from the parent.

* Ferns
* Pine trees
* Spruce trees 
* Fir trees
* Junipers
* Cedars
* Hemlocks

===Mechanical dispersal===

Numerous species have mechanical means to overcome the tendency of a seed to drop close to its parent. Seedpods are often shaped so that the seeds are flung away from the parent plant with considerable force as the seedpod matures

Examples of fruit with mechanical dispersal mechanisms:
* Yellow wood sorrel and Touch-me-not &amp;ndash; as the seed dries, becomes sensitive to disturbance, ejecting tiny seeds in an explosive discharge.  Touch-me-not is named for this behavior.
* Maple trees - the seeds of the Maple tree are those little &quot;helicopters&quot; that children love to play with.  As the seeds falls, the wings cause it to rotate, slowing its descent, and thus allowing a breeze to carry it farther from the parent.  When the seed strikes the ground, it bores into the soil.

[[image:Pisssenlit4.1s.JPG|right|thumbnail|200px|Dandelion &quot;clock,&quot; showing brown achenes and attached pappuses.]]

===Wind===
For non-aquatic, terrestrial plants, the wind is an obvious supplier of energy for movement, and many plants clearly take advantage of this fact.  This type of seed dispersal is not efficient, but very effective. Perhaps most familiar are the feather-light fiber parachutes with attached achenes that are produced by a number of species of flowers, a well-known example being the dandelion (see right).

* Milkweed
* Thistles
* Dandelions

=== Water ===
Plants that grow in water (aquatic and obligate wetland species) are likely to utilize water to disperse their seeds.  For example, all mangroves disperse their offspring by water. In one mechanism, the seedling separates from the fruit, leaving its cotyledons behind, and&amp;mdash;floating horizontally on the water surface&amp;mdash;is carried away by tidal or river flow. After a month or two, the propagated seed turns vertical in the water. Once it &quot;feels&quot; bottom or strands, roots start to develop and leaves appear at the upper end.

A mechanism commonly seen in coastal plants are those that promote flotation of the fruit, allowing the seed to be carried away on the tide or ocean currents. Examples would be:

* The coconut produces a large, dry, fiber-filled fruit capable of a long survival adrift at sea.
* Alexandrian laurel or ''kamani'' produces a globose fruit that is almost cork-like.     

===Animals===
[[Image:Barbed seed in fur 2159.jpg|thumb|right|A barbed seed caught in the fur of a cat.]]
[[Image:Seeds atached to trouser leg.jpg|thumb|Seeds are often the bane of bushwalkers]]
A significant aspect of plant-animal cooperation involves plants designed to take advantage of animal abilities to move. Some fruit have prickly burrs or spikes that attach themselves to a passing animal's fur or feathers so that the animal will carry them away. Some seeds are contained within a soft fruit that &quot;invites&quot; animals to consume it. These seeds have a tough protective outer-coating so that while the fruit is digested, the seeds will pass through their host's digestive tract intact, and grow wherever they fall. Some seeds are appealing to rodents (such as squirrels) who hoard them in hidden caches, often beneath the surface of the soil, in order to avoid starving during the winter and early spring. Those seeds that are left uneaten have the chance to germinate and grow into a new plant.

Some animals that disperse may also eat the seed.

* Beggarlice
* Cockle burr
* Apple
* Banana
* Strawberry
* Oak (acorns)

==8. What conditions are necessary for a seed to sprout? ==
=== Requirements for seed germination ===
Seed germination depends on many factors, both internal and external. The most important external factors include: water, oxygen, temperature, and the correct soil conditions. Every variety of seed requires a different set of variables for successful germination. This depends greatly on the individual seed variety and is closely linked to the ecological conditions in the plants' natural habitat.

==== Water ====
Germination requires moist conditions. Mature seeds are usually very dry and need to take up significant amounts of water before they can &quot;come back to life.&quot;  The uptake of water into seeds leads to a marked swelling. The pressure caused by water aids in cracking the seed coat for germination. When seeds are formed, most plants store large amounts of food, such as starch, proteins, or oils, for the embryo inside the seed. When the seed absorbs water, it breaks down these stored food resources and allows the seedling to germinate and grow until it reaches the light. Once the seedling starts growing, it requires a continuous supply of water and nutrients.

==== Oxygen ====
Most seeds respond best when water levels are enough to moisten the seeds but not soak them, and when oxygen is readily available. Once the seed coat is cracked, the germinating seedling requires oxygen. If the soil is waterlogged, it might cut off the necessary oxygen supply and prevent the seed from germinating.

==== Temperature and light ====
Seeds germinate over a wide range of temperatures, with many preferring temperatures slightly higher than room-temperature. Often, seeds have a set temperature range for sprouting and will not sprout above or below a certain temperature. In addition, some seeds may require exposure to light or to cold temperature to break dormancy before they can germinate. As long as the seed is in its dormant state, it will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating if they never experience frost. Some seeds will only germinate when temperatures reach hundreds of degrees, as during a forest fire. Without fire, they are unable to crack their seed coats. Many seeds in forest settings will not germinate until an opening in the canopy allows then to receive sufficient light for the growing seedling.

==== Stratification ====
[[image:Sjb_whiskey_malt.jpg|thumb|250px|Malted (germinated) barley grains]]

Seeds must be mature and environmental factors must be favorable before germination can take place. When a mature seed is placed under favorable conditions and fails to germinate, it is said to be dormant. Some seeds will not germinate (begin to grow) until they have been dormant for a while. The length of time plant seeds remain dormant can be reduced or eliminated by a simple seed treatment called stratification. Seeds should be planted promptly after stratification.

Stratification mimics natural processes that weaken the seed coat before germination. In nature, some seeds require particular conditions to germinate, such as the heat of a fire (e.g., many Australian native plants), or soaking in a body of water for a long period of time. Others have to be passed through an animal's digestive tract to weaken the seed coat and enable germination.

==9. Make a collection of 30 different kinds of seeds, of which only 10 may be collected from commercial seed packages, the other 20 you are to collect yourself. Label each kind as follows: seed name, date collected, location collected, and col­lector’s name. ==

'''Sima''' is a Finnish [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] drink based on lemons (''Citrus medica''). The purpose of the fermentation is mainly to make the drink bubbly; normal sima contains only very small amounts of alcohol and is suitable also for children. It is especially important in celebrating 1st of May but is made throughout the summer in some families. Sima is considered a variant of [[Cookbook:Mead|mead]].

==Traditional sima==

First gather your equipment. You will need a container large enough to hold all of the sima (a big plastic bucket for example) and empty bottles, their number and size depending on how much sima you are going to make. Plastic soda bottles are recommended as pressure can build up in the bottles. An exploding plastic bottle is less dangerous than an exploding glass bottle. You will also need a funnel for bottling.

You should sterilize all of your equipment. A thorough process is described in the [[Cookbook:Mead|mead]] recipe. However, as the fermentation time of sima is very short (only a few days) and it is usually consumed within a week or so, just washing the bucket and bottles well and then rinsing them with boiling water right before using is generally enough to prevent spoiling.

===Ingredients===

*8 litres of [[Cookbook:Water|water]]
*500g of [[Cookbook:Brown_Sugar|brown sugar]]
*500g of [[Cookbook:Sugar|white sugar]]
*2-3 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]
*1/4 tsp [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]] (ordinary baker's yeast, either fresh or dry)
*handful of [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]]

===First day===
''Time: 20 minutes + sterilization of equipment''
# Boil 4 litres of water.
# Wash the lemons well and peel the zest, being careful not to include the bitter white pith. Put the zest into your container.
# Slice the lemons and remove the white pith from around the slices. Add the slices, too, into the container.
# Add all the sugar into the container with the lemons.
# Pour the boiling water on top, and mix well until the sugar is mostly dissolved.
# Add 4 litres of cold water so that the mixture will be lukewarm, the right temperature for the yeast to activate. If unsure, check with a thermometer, the temperature should be between 35°C and 45°C. When the temperature is right, add the yeast. One way is to take a small cup of the mixture from the container, dissolve the yeast in it and then mix it back. Just dropping a crumb of fresh yeast into the container will also work.
# Let it stand overnight.

===Second day===
''Time: 15 minutes + sterilization of equipment''
# Bottle it on the next day: add one spoonful of sugar and a few raisins to each bottle before you pour the sima in.
# After bottling, let the bottles stand at room temperature out of direct sunlight for 2 more days. The raisins will bloat up and float to the surface.
# Finally, move the bottles to your refrigerator. The sima is ready, and should be served cold. It will keep for at least a week in the refrigerator.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* For a simpler process, just squeeze in the juice of one or two lemons instead of removing the pith.
* You may use 1 kg of brown sugar instead of mixing white and brown, to make a darker sima with a stronger brown sugar flavour.
* All the sugar may optionally be replaced with 1kg [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]].
* You can put the bottled sima into the refrigerator immediately. This will cause the fermentation to be slower; the sima will be ready in approximately 5-7 days.

== Quick sima ==

This slightly less traditional recipe, optimized for simplicity and short preparation time, makes it easier to try making sima: the only equipment needed are a 3 litre open container (a saucepan or small bucket perhaps), a 2 litre soda bottle and a funnel. The result is still undoubtably sima.

Making two litres at a time is very fast and a good way to practice without fear of losing a large batch to an error. On the first day it takes only about as long as it takes for the water to boil, and on the second day the bottling can be done in five minutes. Making a new small batch every 2-3 days lets you drink fresh sima daily without worrying about it spoiling, and takes hardly any time at all.

===Ingredients===
* 250g [[Cookbook:Brown_Sugar|brown sugar]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* Small amount of dry yeast

===First day===
''Time: 10 minutes''
# Boil 1-2 litres of water.
# While the water is boiling, wash your container and squeeze the juice from the lemon into a glass.
# Set aside 1 litre of hot water for the sima. Rinse the container with the rest to sterilize.
# Put 250 grams of brown sugar and the juice of one lemon into a container holding at least 3 litres.
# Pour 1 litre of hot water onto the sugar and lemon juice and mix until sugar dissolves.
# Add 1 litre of cold water.
# Add a very small amount of yeast (up to a quarter teaspoon).
# Let it stand overnight.
===Second day===
''Time: 5 minutes''
# Wash a 2 litre soda bottle and rinse it with boiling water.
# Add a teaspoon of sugar into the bottle and a few raisins if you want to.
# Pour the sima into the bottle with a funnel.
# Leave in a dark place in room temperature for 2 days.
# Move the bottle into the refrigerator; the sima is ready.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Parkour}}
The Pull-up is an upper-body compound exercise, involving many muscles. It requires a sturdy bar, above your shoulders but low enough for you to reach it and it must be able to support your body weight.

== Steps ==
# Grasp the bar above your head firmly. Palms towards you is a chin-up (increasing the load on the biceps), while palms away is a traditional pull-up (increasing the load on the latissimus dorsi and other muscles of the back).  Employing a variety of hand positions from session to session or set to set is beneficial; even a ''&quot;neutral&quot; grip''—the palms facing each other—can be used.  A neutral grip could be used, for example, if exercising between two parallel bars on a jungle gym.
# Curl your legs up so that they are not touching the ground if necessary.
# Use your arms to pull your whole body up.  Try and intentionally focus on the muscles being used during exertion for greater gains.  For example, when doing a traditional pull-up, as described above, focus on drawing the shoulder blades toward each other and down, trying to increase the &quot;feel&quot; of the muscles working.  When focusing on the movements this way, it becomes clear by sensation how differently the hand placement (i.e., towards or away from face) affects the musculature exercised during the movement.
# Pause when your chin is above the bar.
# Go back down slowly.
# Repeat as many times as necessary based on your exercise needs.  Some trainers advise that gains can be increased (or plateaus passed) if one continues on with this exercise ''after'' &quot;failure.&quot;  Failure, as such, occurs when you can no longer pull yourself up to the bar.  To continue, you use the strength in your legs to actually jump up to the bar into a position as if you had already pulled yourself up, and ''slowly'', in a controlled fashion, let yourself down again.  This makes the exercise an eccentric isotonic rather than the standard concentric isotonic, and allows one to exercise the involved muscles to a greater extent (and in a slightly different and physiologically valuable manner, see [[w:Isotonic_(exercise_physiology)#Eccentric|Eccentric contractions]]).

== Tips ==
* Practice. This is a difficult exercise and will take a long time to master. It is not a simple exercise and it requires a fair amount of strength.
* Begin doing it slowly. Only engage in &quot;ballistic&quot; (i.e., fast moving, with explosive force) exercise if you are already practiced in the movement and know the effects and dangers of ballistic exercise.  Nonetheless, swinging while performing the exercise is a waste—try and perform it in as controlled a manner as possible, regardless of the speed.  When exercise-training for applied sports, such as Parkour, which involve ballistic movements as part of their repertoire, it ''is'' important to train one's muscles with ballistic methods.  See [[w:Ballistic_Training#Criteria|Qualities and principles of ballistic training]].

== Variations ==
* '''One handed pull-up''': Use one hand instead of two, to pull yourself up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anatomy describes the composition and relationships of parts of our body. Just describing how our body is composed of many parts helps us guess and memorize functions of our body. Anatomy is what this book is mostly about and it is fascinating to see how well our body is designed. Anatomy deals with organs or groups of organs. An organ is a distinct part of our body with a function, for example our heart. Anatomy of the movement apparatus (all organs that are involved in movement), for example, deals with muscles, bones and tendons. Groups of organs such like this are also called organ systems.

=== How to approach an organ? ===

If you learn about the anatomy of an organ or an organ system, you will soon notice that you can look at an organ from afar and also very close up. If you go to extremes you use a microscope to look at single cells of an organ. All organs are made from cells. Therefore we will understand a lot about an organ by both looking at it with the naked eye - which we will call the macroscopic view - and at cells - which we call the microscopic view. In the individual descriptions of organs you will therefore find both macroscopic and microscopic aspects of that organ.

We now list some subtopics of anatomy and where you can find more information about those organs in this book.

There are many different types of organs such as the heart, liver, brain etc.

== Movement apparatus ==

The movement apparatus deals with the organs needed for movement: bones, muscles and tendons.  While we often think of movement in terms of walking, climbing, or moving our mouths to talk, movement goes on inside of us as well.  For example, our digestive systems use muscles in organs to transport food through the digestive process.  Likewise, movement inside of our bodies by the diaphragm allows us to take in air from our surroundings.

== Circulatory system ==

The so called circulatory system involves everything that keeps our blood in order and flowing. Organs are blood vessels, heart, bone marrow and the spleen. The liver also takes part in keeping our blood healthy but it has many more functions, too. The lungs help in the purification and oxygenation of blood.

== Respiratory system ==

The respiratory system allows us to breathe in order to take in oxygen. This involves the mouth, epiglottis, trachea and the lungs. The respiratory system closely interacts with the circulatory system, because one important function of the blood is to transport oxygen. The heart acts like a pump circulating all the clean blood to different parts of the body and pumps the impure blood for purification to the lungs.

== Digestive system ==

Have you been hungry recently? Our digestive system deals with all the food we take in. Food travels from the mouth through the esophagus to the stomach. From there the small intestine and the large intestine actually absorb nutrients (the small components in our food that our body can make use of) and water. Finally faeces is excreted through the anus.

== Renal system ==

The renal system we only feel when we urinate, or when we have an urge to do so. The kidneys are a filter that cleanses the blood. Also, if we drink more fluid than we need, excess fluid is transported through the kidneys as urine to the bladder. Since unhealthy substances are excreted through the urine, you can see that drinking enough fluid helps keep you healthy.

== Reproductive system ==

The reproductive system differs between men and women. These organs are needed for a couple to have children. A baby is carried by a woman in the uterus. The special organ of the placenta is formed during pregnancy and is shared between mother and child who feeds through this organ.

== Nervous system ==

The '''nervous system''' is composed of the brain, medulla and nerves. The nervous system contains our consciousness and we use our nervous system to control the rest of our body.

== Other organs ==

The '''liver''' is a very important organ, producing many substances that other cells need. It plays an important part in collecting the digestive products with juices that aid digestion. It also stores energy (glycogen) which can be turned into quick form of energy (glucose). In this way the organ plays a major role in providing instant energy to supply important organs. 

'''It is very important to remember that cutting off glucose and oxygen to the brain can make a person unconscious in 3 minutes.''' 
 
Thymus, spleen and tonsils in children help the immune system to defend against bacteria and viruses. 

The largest organ on the human body is the epidermis, also known as our skin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Horticulture''' is meant to eventually become an exhaustive technical manual for professionals in the horticulture trade, as well as a guidebook for gardeners of every level of expertise. The scope of the book includes garden techniques, materials, soils, plants, weeds, diseases, pests, hotricultural chemicals, and beneficial insects. 

Because of this large scope, the ''Wikimanual'' is not intended to be printed out as &quot;one big book&quot;, since this would (after a few years of development) be far too thick a book to fit on any real-world bookshelf. Rather, it is meant to be printed out module-by-module, to cover topic areas for classrooms, or as &quot;custom garden guides&quot; for individual gardeners (only including those pages that pertain to a specific garden). 

Because of the free licensing on Wikibooks, this means that any instructor can create textbooks for a specific class they are teaching, without any need to seek permissions or pay licensing fees. So, for example, an instructor could assemble a book for a two semester course on herbaceous ornamental plants that is specific to the lesson plan, and includes exhaustive discussion of how to grow and maintain any particular plant, from siting and fertilization to pest and disease control to commercial propagation methods. 

Instructors can also use Wikibooks as a venue for class assignments: the edits of each student can be seen on their account logs, and they can of course be assigned particular tasks, such as writing entries for a set of plants, insects, diseases, and so on. 

For amateur gardeners, the ''Wikimanual'' is a place for both learning and sharing &quot;tips and tricks&quot; they have learned from others or invented themselves. &quot;Expert amateurs&quot; often wish that &quot;landscapers&quot; knew how to do things better, and the ''Wikimanual'' is an excellent way to share (in fact, the free license allows anyone to print out copies and distribute them, and even tuck them under windshield wipers). 

==Ways to help==
There are many ways in which to contribute, from indexing to copyediting to maintenance to creating new content. For cleanup and maintenance, a few templates and categories exist for this, such as {{tl|Wmog-tw}} (for cleaning up transwikis that haven't yet been completely modified to fit the ''Wikimanual's''  [[../Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]). 

'''Images''' are also needed for many pages, particularly those pages that describe a process such as [[../Division/]], [[../Pruning/]], and other garden techniques. These should be uploaded to [[commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]] rather than to Wikibooks, because in the future much of this book might be translated into other languages. 

There are also many '''stubs''' that need to be further developed.

Many pages are '''orphaned''' and need to be linked to from the table of contents or a listing linked to from the table of contents.  See all the pages of the book in [[:Category:Horticulture]].

'''New content''' is of course the most important need, since while there are already hundreds of &quot;chapters&quot;, there are thousands of plants, pests, diseases, techniques, and so on.  In general, the best way to start new chapters is by transwikiing content from Wikipedia using the [[Special:Import|Import tool]], which copies all revisions and thus honors our copyrights. To request an import (only administrators can do it, list the Wikipedia article name at [[WB:RFI]].

'''Greece''' (Hellenic Republic) is a country in southern [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]]. It shares borders with [[../Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[../Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[../Albania|Albania]] and [[../Turkey|Turkey]]. The capital city is '''[[w:Athens|Athens]]'''. Other big cities in Greece are Thessaloniki, Patras and Piraeus. Greece is well known for it's history and it's islands. The country is also a member of the [[../EU|European Union]] and uses the Euro as its currency along with 16 other countries in Europe.

==Greece's History==
[[File:Porch of the Maidens (Caryatids) 2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Cryatides in the Acropolis Museum, Athens]]
Greece is heir to the heritages of [[Wikijunior:Ancient Civilizations/Greeks|ancient Greece]], the [[Wikijunior:Ancient Civilizations/Romans|Roman]] and the Byzantine Empire, and nearly four hundred years of Ottoman rule. Greece is the '''birthplace of democracy''', the Olympic Games, western books, and western drama including both tragedy and comedy. The Iliad, an epic poem written by Homer in the 8th Century BC, is the oldest work of western writing. 

Ancient Greece was not a single country; Ancient Greece was divided into lots of small city-states in the south and two kingdoms in the north. Generally the south was much more advanced; Athens and Sparta, the most powerful Greek cities, were in the south. There were many wars between the cities, and it was not until 338 BC (338 'before Christ') when they were all united to fight against the Persians under King Philip II of Macedon, one of the two kingdoms of the north. When Philip died his son, Alexander The Great, took his place and campaigned against Persia, establishing a new era, the Hellenistic era.

After the Hellenistic era, in 146 BC, the Roman period began when the Romans ruled over Greek lands. After a century the whole Greek-speaking world became part of the Roman Empire. Greek was the language used by most of the people in the eastern parts of the Empire, while Latin was spoken more in the west. In 330 AD the capital of the Roman Empire changed; Byzantium, an ancient Greek city, became the new capital, which was then renamed to Constantinople (in Greek: 'The city of Constantine' meaning the emperor who chose Byzantium as the new capital). In the following years the Roman Empire was divided into two parts; the east part became the Byzantine Empire. In 1453 the siege of Constantinople by the Turks took place, the Ottoman Empire was then established.

[[File:Epidauros-Theater-1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Ancient Theatre of Epidauros.]]
For almost four centuries, Greece was part of the Ottoman Empire. In 5 March 1821 Greeks started a revolution so they could be independent. Greece became an independent country on 3 February 1830. Many wars occurred before Greece gained the lands it has today. Greece also took part in the two World Wars. Greece fought alongside the Allies in World War II and the Entente in World War I. A civil war took place after the World Wars, too. After a military junta of 1967–1974 a vote was held for Greeks to decide whether they wanted Greece to become a Republic or to remain a Kingdom. The Greek vote of December 8, 1974, resulted in the end of the monarchy in Greece and the establishment of the current Third Hellenic Republic.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|revolution|when the people try to change the government by force.}} 

Greece became the tenth member of the European Union on January 1, 1981. The country adopted the Euro in 2001 and successfully organized the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. At the moment Greece is facing big economic and social problems.

==Albania's History==
[[Image:Albania in Europe (-rivers -mini map).svg|thumb|300px|right|Map showing the location of Albania in Europe]]
During the fifteenth century Albania enjoyed a brief period of independence under the legendary hero, Skanderbeg. Aside from this exception, the country did not enjoy independence until the twentieth century. After five hundred years of Ottoman rule, an independent Albania was proclaimed in 1912. The country adopted a republican form of government in 1920. In 1939 the Italians invaded the country. Because of this event Albania was one of the first countries occupied by the Axis Powers in World War II.  

After the war Albania became a communist state known as the '''Socialist People's Republic of Albania''' and was ruled by Enver Hoxha until 1985.  Albania became a democratic country in 1991 but faced problems throughout the 1990s.  In 1996 there were severe economic problems because of the failure of '''Ponzi schemes''' in the country.  In 1997 there was an armed rebellion and hundreds of thousands of people emigrated to other parts of Europe and North America.  In 1999 Albania faced an influx of refugees from Kosovo, Serbia during violence in that province.

It shares borders with [[../Poland|Poland]], [[../Russia|Russia]], [[../Belarus|Belarus]], and [[../Latvia|Latvia]].  The capital city is '''[[w:Vilnius|Vilnius]]'''.  Other big cities in Lithuania are Kaunas and Klaipėda.  Lithuania has been part of the [[../EU|European Union]] since 2004.  Lithuania's currency is called the '''Lithuanian Litas'''

==Lithuania's History==

[[Image:LocationLithuaniaInEurope.png|thumb|200px|right|Map showing the location of Lithuania in Europe]]
[[Image:Flag_of_Lithuania.svg|thumb|200px|right|The national flag of Lithuania.]]
Lithuania was first formed in the 6th century. Lithuania first appeared on the map in the middle of 13th century when '''Mindaugas''' united Lithuanian lands. He became a King in 1253 and then Lithuania was recognised as the '''Kingdom of Lithuania'''. Later on, the country expanded quickly and in the beginning of the 15th century Lithuanian Duchy was '''one of the largest countries in Europe''', stretching from Baltic to the Black sea. However, due to a great threat of being occupied by Grand Principality of Moscow, Lithuania united with Poland in 1569 into a Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth country. Lithuania had its own army, currency, laws (the three statutes of Lithuania) and institutions. 

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Poland-Lithuania |five hundred years ago this was a big empire covering most of modern-day Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Belarus and Ukraine}}

In 1795 during the third Partition of the Commonwealth, the country was occupied by Russia, Prussia and Austria. Majority of Lithuanian lands were in the Russian Empire with the rest of it in Prussia. Lithuania re-established its independence after the First World War on February 16, 1918. During the Second World War, The Soviet Union occupied Lithuania in June 1940, one year later Lithuania was occupied by German forces and was reoccupied by Soviet Union in 1944. '''More than 13% of Lithuanian population, including Lithuanian Jews, were killed during the war''', many of them by the secret Soviet police forces were deported to Siberian GULAGs where people died from cold and hunger, the others had been sent to German labour camps. 

March 11, 1990 Lithuania was the first Soviet Republic to renew its independence. Lithuania joined the United Nations on September 17, 1991 and on May 31, 2001 it became the member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). On January 4, 1994, it became the first of the Baltic states to apply for NATO membership. On March 29, 2004, it became a NATO member, and on May 1, 2004, Lithuania joined the '''European Union'''.

==Lithuania's Geography==

Lithuania is situated in northern Europe. It has sandy coastline with big dunes some of which face the open Baltic Sea. There are no mountains in Lithuania, only hills which are not higher that 300 metres (1,000ft). However, there are many lakes and wetlands. The main river is '''Neman''' (Nemunas). Green forests cover about 30% of the land. Climate is wet and moderate, though sometimes weather fluctuations happen with -25C in winter and 38C in summer. According to one geographical computation method, Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, lies only a few kilometres south of the geographical centre of Europe.

==Lithuania's People==

{{wikipedia|Lithuania}}

There are only '''3.3662 million people living in Lithuania''', 84.6% of whom are ethnic Lithuanians who speak the [[Wikijunior:Languages/Lithuanian|Lithuanian]] language, the official language if the country. Together with Latvian, it is one of the two surviving members of the Baltic language group and one of the oldest used spoken languages in the entire world. There are also some minorities in Lithuania, including Poles (6.3%), Russians (5.1%), and Belarusians (1.1%).

Most Lithuanian schools teach English as a first foreign language, but students may also study German, or, in some schools, French. The majority of Lithuanians are [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christian]] Catholics, even though they were very last in Europe to be baptised. It is said that many Lithuanians were following Baltic pagan religion until the middle of 18th century. Many traditions, celebrations and songs come from the pagan times. People then believed in many gods (gods of earth, wind, thunder, water, etc.).

Since 2004 many Lithuanians have moved to other parts of the EU, especially Germany, the UK and Ireland, to work and live.

==Lithuania's Sights==

Today Lithuania is a popular tourist destination.  Most tourists come from the neighbouring Baltic countries, Russia, Germany, Poland and the UK.  Vilnius, the capital, is a popular city for cultural museums and night-life.  There are '''three [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]''' in Lithuania: Kernavė (an archaeological site), Curonian Spit (shared with Russia) and the Old Town of Vilnius.  The [[w:Hill of Crosses|Hill of Crosses]] is a notable religious tourist attraction.

[[Image:Location Iceland Europe.png|thumb|200px|left|Map showing the location of Iceland]]
[[Image:Flag of Iceland.png|thumb|200px|right|The flag of Iceland]]
'''Iceland''' is an island country in the far north west of Europe and is famous for its natures beauty and variety also the loftiness Icelandic Sagas who tell the tales of the Vikings and their survivors. Iceland does not border any other country and the capital city is '''[[w:Reykjavik|Reykjavik]]''' where almost 70% of the Icelandic population live.  Iceland is not part of the [[../EU|European Union]] but it has applied to join in the future.  The '''Krona''' is the currency of Iceland.

==Iceland's History==
[[Image:Law speaker.jpg|thumb|left|205px|A 19th century replica of a meeting of the Alþingi at Þingvellir.]]

It is generally believed that Iceland was discovered and settled by Norse Vikings in the second half of the 9th. The first settler was '''Ingólfur Arnason''' who came to Iceland with his brother Hjörleifur. Hjörleifur was killed by his slaves but Ingólfur built his homestead in Reykjavík in 874. From 874 to 930 lots of people, mostly Norse Vikings and their Irish slaves moved to the island and by 930, most available farmland had been claimed and the Althing, a parliament was founded as the political hub of the Icelandic Free State. Christianity was peacefully adopted in the year 1000. 


In 1814, following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark-Norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms by the way of the Treaty of Kiel. Iceland, however, remained a Danish dependency. The country's climate worsened during the 19th century, leading to mass emigrations to North America, largely Canada. Meanwhile, a new independence movement arose under the leadership of Jón Sigurðsson, inspired by the romantic and nationalist ideologies of mainland Europe. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland home rule, which was expanded in 1904. In 1918, Iceland became fully independent but the head of state remained as the King of Denmark.

During World War II, the German occupation of Denmark on April 9, 1940 severed communications between Iceland and Denmark. A month later, British military forces sailed into Reykjavík harbor, violating Icelandic neutrality. Allied occupation of Iceland lasted throughout the war. In 1941, responsibility for the occupation was taken over by the United States Army. Following a national vote on the subject, Iceland formally became an independent republic on June 17, 1944. The occupation force left in 1946. Iceland became a member of NATO on March 30, 1949, amid domestic controversy and riots. On May 5, 1951, a defence agreement was signed with the United States -- American troops returned and stayed as part of the defence agreement throughout the Cold War and until the autumn of 2006.

Since World War II Iceland's economy has grown incredibly.  The most common industries are financial services, tourism and fishing.

{{{{BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Define|Cold War|between 1945 and 1991 there was military, economic, space, sporting and competition between the USA (and its allies) and the USSR (and its allies).  There were often fears that a global war might start.}}

Iceland is an island with no borders. It is often referred to as '''the island of ice and fire''' and is constantly being shaped by Glaciers and volcanoes. The island is about 103,000 km² (39,768.5 sq mi) meaning that per 3 Icelanders has 1 km² for them self. About 23,805 km² (9,191 sq mi) of the island is Vegetation, 2,757 km² (1,065 sq mi) are Lakes and about 11,922 km² (4,603 sq miles) are Glaciers.
Iceland is geologically a young land, Iceland is located on a geological so called hot spot, thought to be caused by a mantle plume. Meaning that under the island is a hot red burning lava coming up all the way from the inner earth The island is also over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which runs right through it. This combined location means that geologically the island is extremely active, having many volcanoes, notably Hekla, Eldgjá, and Eldfell. The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783–1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population; the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months after the eruption.
Iceland has hundreds of mountains and volcanoes.  The highest mountain is [[w:Hvannadalshnúkur|Hvannadalshnúkur]] at 2,110 metres.

Because Iceland is over a so called hot spot there are lots of hot springs and are also geysers. A word derived from the name of the most famous one in Iceland, Geysir in Haukadalur the most geologically active is Strokkur in the same area. 
With such a widespread availability of geothermal power, and also because of the numerous rivers and waterfalls that are harnessed for hydro power, residents of most towns have hot water and home heat for a low price. The island itself is composed primarily of basalt, a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism like Hawaii. There are, however, a variety of volcano-types on Iceland that produce more evolved lavas.

==Iceland's People==
[[Image:Gulfoss Iceland 2005.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Gullfoss, Because of Iceland is such a young land it contains hundreds of waterfalls]]
The Icelandic Population is about 300.000 people which is about the size of a small city in Europe therefore there are lots of things that make the Icelandic people so special for one their language.

Icelanders write and speak [[Wikijunior:Languages/Icelandic|Icelandic]], a North Germanic language descended from Old Norse. It is the only living language to retain the runic letter Þ which indicates the fact that Icelandic has changed less from Old Norse than the other Nordic languages and has a considerable extent development of new vocabulary based on native roots rather than borrowings from English. Because of that Icelanders can still read and understand Old Norse which their famous sagas are written in. The Sagas were written around the time of the island's settlement. Until the Christianization of Iceland, many traditional Viking beliefs held strong, remnants of which remain today. For example, some Icelanders either believe in elves or are unwilling to rule out their existence. [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christianity]] is the main religion in Iceland.

The majority of national foods are based around fish, lamb and dairy products. '''Þorramatur''' is a national food, consisting of many different dishes; this is not consumed on a daily basis but usually around the month of Þorri. Traditional dishes include skyr, cured ram scrota, cured shark, singed sheep heads and black pudding.

Though changing in the past years, Icelanders remain a very healthy nation. Children and teenagers participate in various types of leisure activities. Popular sports today are mainly football, track and field, handball and basketball. Sports such as golf, tennis, swimming, chess and horseback riding on Icelandic horses are also popular.

Iceland is home to the television station Nick Jr.'s animated program LazyTown (Icelandic: Latibær), a television program created by Magnús Scheving. It has become a very popular program for children and adults, and is shown in over 98 countries, including the US, Canada, Sweden and Latin America.[17] The LazyTown Studios are located in Garðabær. Iceland was also the home of The Sugarcubes, a popular 80's and 90's pop group; whose members included the now famous singer Björk.

==Iceland's Sights==

500,000 tourists visit Iceland every year.  Popular attractions include the rugged landscape of Iceland which is generally peaceful because there are so few people in the country.  Volcanoes, mountains and lakes are all extremely popular because of their sheer number.  The capital city is popular because of its small city when compared to other world capitals.  Iceland has 2 [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]: '''Þingvellir National Park''' and Surtsey, which is a small volcanic island of the Icelandic coast.

[[Image:Location Norway.svg|thumb|200px|right|Map showing the location of Norway (green) in Europe]]
'''Norway''' is a country in north-western Europe.  It shares borders with [[../Sweden|Sweden]], [[../Finland|Finland]], and [[../Russia|Russia]].  The capital city is '''[[w:Oslo|Oslo]]'''.  Other big cities in Norway are Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim and Kristiansand.  Norway's currency is called the Norwegian krone.  Norway is not a member of the [[../EU|European Union]].  The Norwegian people voted &quot;no&quot; for joining the EU.

==Norway's History==
[[Image:Flag of Norway.svg|thumb|200px|right|The flag of Norway]]
Norway's history is dominated by war, especially from 900-1349 A.D. The well-known ''Vikings'' discovered and settled places like Greenland, [[../Iceland|Iceland]] and Newfoundland, and conquered places like the Isle of Man, the Orkneys and the Shetland Islands. After ''the Black Death'', Norway was a part of ''The Kalmar Union'' (Norway, Denmark and Sweden), and later, when Sweden went out of the union, Norway was part of Denmark for almost 400 years. In 1814 Norway made its own constitution, and Norway was allowed to keep it when in union with Sweden. In 1905 Norway became independent again, and after an election, the Norwegian people chose to be a kingdom with the Danish King's son as King. He took the more Norwegian-like name Haakon, and his son took the name Olav. The Queen continued to be Maud.

==Norway's Geography==
'''Fjords''', long inlets from the sea, cover most of Norway's coastline.  Norway is a very ''long'' country, like Chile.  It stretches from 57° and 81° North and parts of the north are in the Arctic Circle.

Norway has over 50,000 islands and a coastline of 83,000 kilometres (because of the large number of islands and rugged coastline).

Norway's highest mountain is [[w:Galdhøpiggen|Galdhøpiggen]] at 2,469 metres.
==Norway's People==
[[Image:Geiranger 3 Norwegen.JPG|thumb|280px|right|Geiranger, Norway]]
Norways' population is mostly ethnic Norwegians and people from the other Scandinavian countries. Approximately 5 million people live in Norway.

The majority of Norwegians are Protestant [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Christianity|Christian]].  There are also small minorities of Catholic Christians, [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Islam|Muslims]] and [[Wikijunior:World Religions/Judaism|Jews]].

The main language of Norway is [[Wikijunior:Languages/Norwegian|Norwegian]] (which has 2 written forms).  A variety of Sami languages are spoken by the Sami people especially in the north of the country.

One famous Norwegian artist was [[w:Edvard Munch|Edvard Munch]] who is famous for [[w:The Scream|The Scream]]

==Norway's Sights==

Norway is very popular with tourists especially those who live the great outdoors.  Norway is a '''very expensive country''' but many tourists visit every year to see the famous fjords, the unspoiled nature and the attractive towns around the country.

The most visited tourist sites in Norway are Holmenkollen Ski Jump and Bryggen which is a [[Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].  The capital, Oslo, is popular for business trips and sight-seeing trips and cruises in the Arctic north are popular especially during the winter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Theodore Herman Albert Dreiser (August 27, 1871 &amp;ndash; December 28, 1945) was an American naturalist author known for dealing with the gritty reality of life. He was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, to Sarah and John Paul Dreiser, a strict Catholic. John, his father, was a German immigrant and Sarah was from the Mennonite farming community near Dayton, Ohio; she was disowned for marrying John and converting to Catholicism. Theodore was the twelfth of thirteen children (the ninth of the ten surviving). The popular songwriter Paul Dresser (1859&amp;ndash;1906) was his older brother.  From 1889&amp;ndash;1890, Theodore attended Indiana University before flunking out.  Within several years, he was writing for the ''Chicago Globe'' newspaper and then the ''St. Louis Globe-Democrat''.  After proposing in 1893, he married Sara White on December 28, 1898.  They ultimately separated in 1909, but were never formally divorced.

I'm also a fan of SiFi and Fantasy books check [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Panic2k4/Books_Read#Books_read.2C_SF_.26_Fantasy_Books.2C_their_authors_and_my_rates  Books read, SF &amp; Fantasy Books, their authors and my rates], if you have some favorites tell me about it :) it's becoming hard to find any good ones. Have you taken a look into the [[C++ Programming]] book ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:57, 18 May 2007 (UTC)
: First of all, thank you for your notice, it is fixed now. I saw your page. There are many author that I don't know. I suppose this is fantasy. I don't like it. From the author I saw, I was surprised to see Dante Alighieri. Does he write Science fiction or fantasy? Fairy tails are also thought to be prototype of fantasy... Stanislaw Lem and Isaac Asimov I love them much and read many books they wrote. Harry Harrison have interesting books too, but have not interesting books too. I like SiFi of 70-80's. They are good. The latest one has much of rubbish. I suppose, you've already read this classic. (Again, I am not reading fantasy and I distinguish them). I can recommend you to read brothers Strugatsky books. They are Russian writers and not very popular abroad Russia. If you'll find their books, I recommend you to read it. I'll just note few of them: &quot;The bug in an ant hill&quot;, &quot;Waves extinguish a wind&quot; (continue of the first one), &quot;Picnic on a roadside&quot;, &quot;Monday begins on Saturday&quot; (while it is defined as SiFi, I think it is on the border between SiFi and fantasy) and much more. I suppose you've read Oruel's &quot;1984&quot;. I recommend you also to read Nabakov (while it is not SiFi or fantasy).
I've just created new page [[m:b:en:User:Alexsmail/What to read|m:b:en:Wikibooks/User:Alexsmail/What to read?]] So you can see books that I'm going to read their. (I warn you, there is no SiFi or fantasy their.). I haven't taken a look into the [[C++ Programming]] book yet. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 15:21, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
:: I have examined the [[C++ Programming]] book, see my comment in [[Talk:C++ Programming]]. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 16:37, 19 May 2007 (UTC)
::: Can't find your post, probably I already replied to it some time ago. Keep an eye on [[C++ Programming/Editor's TOC]] for anything you can add.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:04, 12 September 2007 (UTC)

== Russian translation ==

Unfortunately I know no Russian whatsoever, but the people in [[:Category:User ru-1]], [[:Category:User ru-2]], or [[:Category:User ru-3]] might be able to help you. If there's no one active on those lists you might want to check the analogous categories on wikipedia (see [[w:wikipedia:babel|Wikipedia's babel page]]). Good luck.

== Re: help requested ==

I started translating your book at [[A scientific perspective of philosophy]]. Take a look and tell me what do you think about.

--[[User:Vitalij zad|vitalij]] 12:32, 8 September 2007 (UTC)
: Thank you! It is looks fine. When I'm translating back to Russian, I do understand the text. I will keep eye on your work. Unfortunately, I can't help you with the style in English, since my level of English is not that great. [[User:Alexsmail|alexsmail]] 12:09, 9 September 2007 (UTC)
:: I had to clean up the text and develop more the examples you did because before it was understandable only to phisicists while we would like to speak with philosophers!
::--[[User:Vitalij zad|vitalij]] 09:12, 10 September 2007 (UTC)
::: I don't want to lose the physic part of the book. If you can, add more parts. It is great, but don't lose the existing parts. You can remove the formulas, but don't avoid the physics explanations. They are not really physics, but popular scientific (научно-популярные) information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to help you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* You should sign your name on Talk and vote pages using four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window that will insert this, too; it looks like part of a signature.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[WB:SL|Staff Lounge]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or ask me personally on my talk page. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add this page to your &quot;watchlist&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Guidelines==
When working on this project, remember that it's aimed at children. It's more important to be understood than to be precisely accurate on every detail. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simpler language would work.  When you have to use an uncommon or technical word, list it in the glossary of basic terms and define it. Giving definitions when such words are used is generally a good idea as well.

Please, if you can contribute to this book, do so.  Many sections are in need of help. You can work on almost anything including this page, but if you want to make some significant changes please bring them up [[Talk:Wikijunior Human Body|on the discussion page]].  You are welcome to create modules for additional parts of the body.

Try to restrict discussion to the main discussion page so that people can actually see your message without having to check specific pages.

==Create or request an article==
You are encouraged to create an article on an interesting part of the body. Note however that not all articles will make it into the final published version, though they will all be available on this live online version. If you would like someone else to write a page about a part of the body, add your suggestion to the ''Article Stubs'' list. When creating stub articles please use the [[Wikijunior Human Body/Stub Template]].

&lt;!-- Except for the first article, add a request alphabetically in the format:
 * [[/Body Part/]] 
--&gt;
==Major questions==
Consider using these questions as headings in each article:

* What does a %body part% look like?
* What are the parts of the %body part%?
* What is the function of the %body part%?
* How does the %body part% interact with other parts of the body?
* How can you keep your %body part% healthy?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Books read, SF &amp; Fantasy Books, their authors and how I rank them ==
{{TOC right}}
'''Rates are from 1-10:&lt;br&gt; (?) = can't remember, (Q) = quit in the middle, (8-9) - you shouldn't die without reading those, (5-7) - pretty cool, (3-4) - mediocre'''

My rating is based on many factors, most important to me is the level of imagination or new concepts a work introduces without getting turned into dreamscapes. Secondly how intelligent the author is in advancing the plot in a plausible way without boring the reader to death. I don't like mundane story lines or overcomplicated concepts or very convoluted mental or moral dilemmas, if pieces don't fit well together I will not like it, I'm willing to turn off the reality/science verifier if the history is entertaining, a capacity one must have if one enjoys only books and has a good imagination.

I have read many more books I will try to tag the ones I remember or came across with a &quot;?&quot; until I revisit the text and rate it. Also if I quit (&quot;q&quot;) a book it was because the history was boring or very confusing or just didn't catch my interest I will rate the work as for what I did read so classification may be off by one point above what I would rank it if I spent the time to really find out. I rarely skip to the end of the book in that event, if I quit its because I just don't care what happens next. This is important as low ranking books if finished indicate a good plot line.

== &lt;s&gt;Votes and/or&lt;/s&gt; discussion ==

&lt;s&gt;{{Support}}&lt;/s&gt; - The only change I'd make is to clarify the sysop bot section. If I use AWB under Mike.lifeguard to do deletions without a flag is that ok? I think it should be - if I wanted a bot flag for those deletions, it'd need the extra discussion and approval at [[WB:RFA]], but without the flag they're subject to the full scrutiny of normal deletions, so the tool used shouldn't matter. If the actions were to be &quot;hidden&quot; by a bot flag, then some prior discussion would be in order. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:36, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

:I think you need a bot account that has been through RfA to take &quot;admin&quot; actions using a bot (I seem to recall being told that running a bot on an existing admin account was not ok). --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 12:04, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

::That's my impression too - that using a bot for admin actions under an existing admin account isn't ok. But I think it should be - ''if'' the account is ''not'' bot-flagged (since the changes would be subject to the same scrutiny as any of your other admin actions).

:::For what I remember of discussions on the problem, is that all bot action without the bot flag do appear in the changes log. So the main objection is not the use but the length or periodicity of the bot's actions, some admins do use scripts (that's a kind of bot), so the remaining problem is not to clutter the logs and keep a low number on errors.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:31, 16 October 2007 (UTC)

::I'm of the impression that using an automated admin script is perfectly fine. In fact, I suspect (although cannot prove and refuse to make any such allegations) that certain users are already using such a script. Common tasks that would benefit from automation include mass-deletions (such as images, or books with large numbers of pages that have been VfD'd) or open proxy blocking (blocking large ranges at once). If you run such a script and dont tell anybody, what would be the difference from how things are now? If anything, we should encourage people to announce what tools they are using, so those tools can be opened to public scrutiny and reliability tests. I would say I am generally against giving such an admin-bot a flag, just because we do want all admin tasks to be easily viewable and verifiable. In fact, in lieu of a policy stating that such admin-scripts cannot be used, I would say that such tools should be cultivated and encouraged. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:06, 17 October 2007 (UTC)
[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Is this proposal still running? If not what about a merge or coming to a consensus with the unstable branch...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:16, 26 March 2008 (UTC)
::I will rename the thread to only discussion and leave it running as there was no announcement of a vote and no one seems willing to support what seems an adoption proposal (since the objective of the vote can only be implied).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:33, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

== One small issue ==

I really like the current text of the proposal as-is. It's simple and really gets across the point that the bot flag is really not a big deal. One small point I noticed (and I still {{support}} this proposal anyway) is that it's a little bit unclear about where the bot flag comes from. It says no real vote is required, but does that mean, as I think it should, that granting and revoking the bot flag is done at the discretion of bureaucrats only. It's a small issue, really, so I still support this. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:14, 21 October 2008 (UTC)

:Why not let admins give and revoke the bot flag like we do now with the patrol and rollback flag? Would take some load off bureaucrats. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:39, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
::Unfortunately, that decision hasn't really borne any fruit - we still have only a handful of patrollers/rollbackers. Given admins may flag themselves for temp jobs, I don't see the need to make it an admin-settable bit. As well, bots can actually do damage; I'd like to think our bureaucrats are trusted to protect the community from such mishaps.
::As well, can we try to keep conversation in one place? I chose [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Administrative_Assistance#Implementing_Flood_flag_and_a_bot_policy|WB:AA]] since it had the background info there. It'll be easier for everyone to see and evaluate what's going on with respect to the proposal if things are consolidated. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:53, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
::I guess I didn't answer Andrew's question. Yes, the intent is that bureaucrats will simply grant the flag in uncontroversial cases.

== Draft of the unstable branch is up for approval as policy ==
The process is taking place here [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote/Bots]].

== Global bots ==

This policy says nothing about whether global bots are automatically approved or even whether global bots are allowed at all.  (I suspect the community would be against it due to past apprehensions about interwiki linking, but this should be clarified).

==What is a comma splice?==
&quot;Comma splice&quot; is the term commonly used to describe two independent clauses (basically, clauses that express a complete thought and could stand on their own as full sentences) joined by a comma rather than other accepted punctuation approaches, such as a comma with a coordinating conjunction, a period, or a semi-colon. Like the run-on sentence, they may have a coordinating conjunction (and, or, nor, but, for, so yet) between them but not the comma that needs to accompany the coordinating conjunction when separating two independent clauses.

==Examples of comma spliced sentences==
* ''Every day, millions of children go to daycare with millions of other kids, there is no guarantee that none of them are harboring infectious conditions.''
* ''Many daycares have strict rules about sick children needing to stay away until they are no longer infectious, enforcing those rules can be very difficult.''
* ''Daycare providers often undergo extreme pressure to accept a sick child &quot;just this once,&quot; the parent has no other care options and cannot miss work.''

==Fixing comma spliced sentences==
Once you find a comma spliced sentence and notice where the two independent clauses are &quot;spliced,&quot; you can then decide on how best to separate the clauses:
* You can make two complete sentences by inserting a period'''.''' This is the strongest level of separation.
* You can use a semicolon between the two clauses if they are of equal importance''';''' this allows your your reader to consider the points together.
* You can use a semicolon with a transition word to indicate a specific relation between the two clauses''';however,''' use this sparingly. 
* You can use a coordinating conjunction following the comma''', and''' this also will indicate a relationship.
* Or, you can add a word to one clause to make it dependent.

==Examples of fixed comma spliced sentences==
Notice how the sentences above have been punctuated in the following examples.

* ''Every day, millions of children go to daycare with millions of other '''kids. There''' is no guarantee that none of them are harboring infectious conditions.''

==1. Know 25 parts of a dairy cow.==
==2. What considerations are made when selecting a calf?==
The best approach is a holistic one, by taking a close look at the genetics of the calf and the environment. Both of these factors have an effect on the final phenotype. Maternal and paternal characteristics are important as well as the heritability of these traits. When selecting a calf don't always select on appearance. Know that the calf is going to be used for before selection. Characteristics differ between dairy and beef calves.

==3. Know the care, management, and feeding of dairy cows during their following stages:==
===a. Calves===
===b. Weaning to six months===
===c. Six months to fifteen months===
===d. Fifteen months to springers===
===e. The dry cow===
==4. Know the proper feeding techniques for a lactating cow.==
==5. Know how milk is produced in the cow.==
==6. Know the steps in milking a cow either by hand or machine.==
===Hand Milking===
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Milk a cow}}
===Machine Milking===
[[Image:Cow milking machine in action DSC04132.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The milking machine extracts milk from all teats'']] 
Milking machines are used to extract milk from cows when the herd is larger than about 4 cows.  The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder.  It is made up of a claw, four teatcups, long milk tube, long pulsator tube, and pulsator.  The claw is a manifold which connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the long pulse tubes and long milk tubes.  Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic.  Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic), which holds a soft inner liner or inflation.  Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow.  The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulsation chamber.

Milking machines work in a way that is different from hand milking or calf suckling. Continuous vacuum is applied inside the soft liner to withdraw milk from the teat by creating a pressure difference across the teat canal (or opening at the end of the teat). Vacuum also helps keep the machine attached to the cow.  The vacuum applied to the teat causes congestion of teat tissues (accumulation of blood and other fluids). Atmospheric air is admitted into the pulsation chamber about once per second (the pulsation rate), to allow the liner to collapse around the end of teat and relieve congestion in the teat tissue. The ratio of the time that the liner is open (milking) and closed (massaging or resting) is called the pulsation ratio.  

The four streams of milk from the teatcups are usually combined in the claw and transported to the milkline or collection bucket (usually sized to the output of one cow) in a single milk hose.  Milk is then transported (manually in buckets) or with a mechanical pump to a central storage vat or bulk tank.  Milk is refrigerated on the farm in most countries either by passing through a heat-exchanger or in the bulk tank. 

In the photo above is a bucket milking system with the stainless steel bucket visible on the far side of the cow.  The two rigid, stainless steel teatcup shells applied to the front two quarters of the cow are visible.  The top of the flexible liner is visible at the top of the shells as are the short milk tubes and short pulsation tubes extending from the bottom of the shells to the claw.  The bottom of the claw is transparent to allow observation of milk flow.  When milking is completed the vacuum to the milking unit is shut off, and the teatcups are removed.

Milking machines keep the milk enclosed and safe from external contamination. The interior 'milk contact' surfaces of the machine are kept clean by a manual or automated  washing procedure implemented after milking is completed.  Milk contact surfaces must comply with regulations requiring  food grade materials (typically stainless steel and special plastics and rubber compounds) and are easily cleaned.  

Most milking machines are powered by electricity but, in case of electrical failure, there can be an alternative means of motive power, often an internal combustion engine, for the vacuum and milk pumps. Milk cows cannot tolerate delays in scheduled milking without serious milk production reductions.

# Long milk tube
# Short pulse tubes
# Long pulsator tube

==8. What is mastitis? What steps can be taken to prevent mastitis?==
Mastitis is the inflammation of the mammary gland.  It is usually caused by a bacterial infection from ''Staphylococcus'', ''Streptococcus'', ''E. coli'', or ''Mycoplasma''.  It can have many causes, including by poor milking practices, poorly fitting teatcups, faulty milking equipment, and freezing.  It can be spread to other cows when bedding is shared between an afflicted cow and a healthy cow.  It can be prevented by vaccination.

==9. Know five herd health problems, their symptoms, and how to prevent and/or treat them.==
===Mastitis===
Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary glands.  It has been covered in the previous requirement.

===Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy===
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is more commonly known as ''mad cow disease''.  The infectious agent in BSE is believed to be a specific type of misfolded protein called prion. Misfolded prion proteins carry the disease between individuals and cause deterioration of the brain.  Different theories exist for the origin of prion proteins in cattle. Two leading theories suggest that it may have jumped species from the disease scrapie in sheep, or that it evolved from a spontaneous form of &quot;mad cow disease&quot; which has been seen occasionally in cattle for many centuries.  

Cattle, like most other food animals, are normally herbivores. In nature, cattle eat grass or grains. In modern industrial cattle-farming, various commercial feeds are used, which may contain ingredients including antibiotics, hormones, pesticides, fertilizers, and protein supplements. The use of meat and bone meal as a protein supplement in cattle feed was widespread in Europe prior to about 1987. Worldwide, soybean meal is the primary plant-based protein supplement fed to cattle. However, soybeans do not grow well in Europe, so cattle raisers throughout Europe turned to the less expensive animal byproduct feeds as an alternative. A change to the rendering process in the early 1980s may have resulted in a large increase of the infectious agents in the cattle feed. A contributing factor seems to have been a change in British laws that allowed a lower temperature sterilization of the protein meal.

Soybean meal is cheap and plentiful in the United States. As a result, the use of animal byproduct feeds was never common, as it was in Europe. However, U.S. regulations only partially prohibit the use of animal byproducts in feed. In 1997, regulations prohibited the feeding of mammalian byproducts to ruminants such as cows and goats. However, the byproducts of ruminants can still be legally fed to pets or other livestock such as pigs and poultry such as chickens. In addition, it is legal for ruminants to be fed byproducts from some of these animals.  A proposal to end the use of cow blood, restaurant scraps, and poultry litter (fecal matter, feathers) in January 2004 has yet to be implemented, despite the efforts of some advocates of such a policy, who cite the fact that cows are herbivores, and that blood and fecal matter could potentially carry BSE.

===Foot and Mouth Disease===
Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), sometimes called hoof-and-mouth disease, is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and pigs. It can also infect deer, goats, sheep, and other bovids with cloven hooves, as well as elephants, rats, and hedgehogs. Humans are affected only very rarely.

Foot-and-mouth disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly after two or three days; blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling; and blisters on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness. Adult animals may suffer weight loss from which they do not recover for several months as well as swelling in the testicles of mature males, and in cows, milk production can decline significantly.

One of the difficulties in vaccinating against FMD is the huge variation between viral strains. There is no cross-protection between strains (meaning that a vaccine for one strain won't protect against any others) and in addition, two strains within a given strain may have nucleotide sequences that differ by as much as 30% for a given gene. This means that FMD vaccines must be highly specific to the strain involved. Vaccination only provides temporary immunity that lasts from months to years.

===Rinderpest===
Rinderpest (RP) is an infectious viral disease of cattle, domestic buffalo, and some species of wildlife, it is commonly referred to as cattle plague. It is characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. In German, ''Rinderpest'' means ''cattle-plague''.  It can be prevented by vaccination. Effective control of rinderpest has been established and by the end of 2010, the FAO plan to have eradicated it completely.

===Blackleg===
Blackleg is an infectious bacterial disease of sheep and cattle, caused by Clostridium chauvoei bacteria. It is found all over the world. A symptom of blackleg is characteristic swellings which make a cracking sound under pressure. Blackleg vaccine gives immunity against it.
Burning the upper layer of soil to eradicate left-over spores is the best way to stop the spread of blackleg from diseased cattle.
===Foot Rot===
Foot rot, or infectious pododermatitisis, is a hoof infection that is commonly found in sheep and cattle. As the name suggests, it rots away the foot of the animal, more specifically the area between the two toes of the infected animal. It is extremely painful and contagious. It can be treated with a series of medications but if not treated the whole herd can become infected. The cause of the infection in cattle is two anaerobic bacteria (grow without oxygen), Fusobacterium Necrophorum and Bacteroides Melaninogenicus. Both bacteria are common to the environment in which cattle live and the Fusobacterium is present in the rumen and fecal matter of the cattle themselves. Usually there is an injury to the skin between the hooves that allows the bacteria to infect the animal. Another cause of foot rot may high temperatures or humidity causing the skin between the hooves to crack and let the bacteria infect the foot. This is one of the reasons that foot rot is such a major problem in the summer. Foot rot is easily identifiable by its appearance and foul odor. Treatment is usually with an antibiotic medication, and preventing injury to the feet is the best way to prevent foot rot.

==10. Know the meaning of the following terms:==
;a. Concentrates:
;b. Crude protein:
;c. Cull:
;d. Dry period:
;e. Lactating:
;f. Lactation cycle or period:
;g. Oxytocin: Oxytocin is a hormone which causes the smooth muscle layer of band-like cells surrounding the alveoli to squeeze the newly-produced milk into the duct system. Oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex, or let-down to occur.

==11. Explain the pasteurization of milk and the proper care of dairy utensils and appliances.==
==12. Assist with the care and milking of a dairy herd of cows for at least three months.==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Historically, the milking and the processing took place close together in space and time: on a dairy farm. [[Image:Milking-a-cow-past.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''Milking the old-fashioned way'']] People milked the animals by hand; on farms where only small numbers are kept, hand-milking may still be practiced. Hand-milking is accomplished by grasping the teats (often pronounced 'tits') in the hand and expressing milk by either squeezing the fingers, progressively, from the udder end to the tip or by squeezing the teat between thumb and index finger then moving the hand downward from udder towards the end of the teat. This is repeated, using both hands for speed. Both methods result in the milk that was trapped in the milk duct being squirted out the end into a bucket that is supported between the knees (or rests on the ground) of the milker, who usually sits on a low stool. 

Traditionally the cow, or cows, would stand in the field or paddock while being milked. Young stock, heifers, would have to be trained to remain still to be milked.  In many countries the cows were tethered to a post and milked. The problem with this method is that it relies on quiet, tractable beasts, because the hind end of the cow is not restrained. In cold countries where cows are kept in barns, at least for the winter if not throughout the year, they are still tethered only by the neck or head, particularly where they are kept in small numbers.
