      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 4. Configuring Simulation==

Model simulation has a set of specific settings. A group of model settings is called an experiment, and experiments are displayed at the bottom of the model branch in the workspace tree. You can create several experiments for the same model with alternative model settings. One experiment is created by default and named ''Simulation''. 

[[File:Step 4. Configuring the simulation 1.png]]

If we start the model, it will work for 100 time units and then will stop. Since we want to observe the process for a long time, we need to remove the model stop condition. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Remove the model stop condition'''
#In the '''Project''' view, click the ''Simulation:Main'' experiment item.
#Go to the '''Model Time''' tab of the '''Properties''' window. Here you can define model time settings. In Pedestrian Library a model time unit is considered as one day of a model lifetime (you can see that ''days'' are chosen as '''Time units'''). 
#Choose '''Never''' in the '''Stop''' drop-down list. The model now will simulate infinitely until we will stop it.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 4. Configuring the simulation 2.png]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 5. Running the Model==

We have finished creating a simple model using AnyLogic Pedestrian Library. Now you can run the model. 

Build your model by clicking the '''Build Model''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model.gif‎]] toolbar button. If there are some errors in your model, the building fails and the '''Problems''' view appears listing all the errors found in your model. Double-click an error in the list to open the location of the error and fix it.

[[File:Step 5. Running the model 1.png|none|frame|''Problems view'']]

After the model is successfully built, you can start it. Running the simulation, you automatically bring the current model up to date.  

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Start the model'''
#Click the '''Run''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model2.gif‎]] toolbar button and choose the experiment you want to run from the drop-down list. Your simulation experiment is called &lt;tt&gt;Subway Entrance/Simulation&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 5. Running the model 2.png]]&lt;/br&gt;In the case this model is the only one opened in the workspace at the moment you will be prompted to run this particular experiment. Later on this button will start the previously run experiment. To run any other experiment, right-click the experiment in the '''Project''' view and choose '''Run''' from the context menu.

Having started the model, you will see the presentation window. It displays the presentation designed for your simulation experiment.

[[File:Step 5. Running the model 3.png]]

Click the button to '''Run the model and switch to Main view''' and observe the process you have modeled. You can see that the model behaves correct: passengers enter the subway entrance and pass through the corridor leading to the subway trains.

[[File:Step 5. Running the model 4.png]]

You can adjust the execution speed to your needs using '''Slow down''' and '''Speed up''' [[File:Step_7._Running_the_model_4.png]] toolbar buttons. You can also switch to virtual time mode to view simulation run at its maximum speed and simulate a long period of time. To enable virtual time mode click the '''Toggle real/virtual time mode''' [[File:Step 5. Running the model 5.png]] toolbar button.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 6. Adding Ticket Control Gates==

Now we will expand our model by adding automatic ticket control gates. Thus we will show you how services are defined in Pedestrian Library.

First, we will modify our animation and then modify the model flowchart.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the model animation'''
#Draw four lines representing ticket control gates as shown in the figure below.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding ticket control gates 1.png]]
#The starting point is important. Passengers will move from the stating to the ending point of a line.
#Create a group containing all these lines drawn.  We need it since we want to define a service with several shapes.&lt;/br&gt;Select four just created lines (the easiest way to select several shapes is to subsequently click on them with '''Ctrl''' pressed), right-click the selection and choose '''Grouping/Create a group''' from the popup menu. You will see a group icon [[File:Step 6. Adding ticket control gates 2.png]] appeared in the center of the selection. Select this group and rename it to &lt;tt&gt;gatesGroup&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Draw polylines animating queues to ticket control gates as shown in the figure below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding ticket control gates 3.png]]
#The starting point of the polyline is important. It stands for the head of the queue. Therefore place the first point of each polyline near the corresponding ticket control gate.
#Add all just created polylines to a new group as you did it recently for the lines representing control gates. Name this group &lt;tt&gt;gatesQueuesGroup&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Draw a line as shown in the figure below. Name it &lt;tt&gt;lineBeforeGates&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding ticket control gates 4.png]]

Now we will modify the model flowchart.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the model flowchart'''
#Add new objects and connect them as shown below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding ticket control gates 5.png]]
#Modify the properties of the [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedGoTo.html PedGoTo] object. Now we want this block to move passengers not to subway trains but to our line located before the ticket control gates.&lt;/br&gt;Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding ticket control gates 6.png]]
#*Specify new destination for passengers. Choose &lt;tt&gt;lineBeforeGates&lt;/tt&gt; as the '''Target (point, line)'''.
#Configure [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedServices.html PedServices] object. '''PedServices''' object represents one or multiple services and defines its default properties. Services defined by this object can be referenced by flowchart objects [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedServices.html PedServices].&lt;/br&gt;Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding ticket control gates 7.png]]
#*'''Name''' this object &lt;tt&gt;gates&lt;/tt&gt;.
#*Specify the group containing lines representing services. Type &lt;tt&gt;gatesGroup&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Services (group of lines)''' field.
#*Specify the group containing polylines representing queues to services. Type &lt;tt&gt;gatesQueuesGroup&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Queues (group of lines, polylines)''' field.
#*Leave all other properties unchanged. You can see that the '''Delay''' time is uniformly distributed with minimum value of 2 seconds and maximum value of 3 seconds. Leave it since it is typical delay time for ticket control gates.
#*Leave the '''Service type''': ''Delay and pass through''. There are two types of services in Pedestrian Library. ''Delay and pass through'' service is defined by a line, along which pedestrians should move. Pedestrian services at beginning point of the line and then moves to ending point before leaving service. We use it since we want passengers to pass through service lines representing ticket control gates. Another type of ''service'' (''Delay'') is also defined by line, which pedestrians should step on for service delay time.
#Configure [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedService.html PedService] object. '''PedService''' object is added into flowchart to model how pedestrian flow passes through a service defined by [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedService.html PedService] object.&lt;/br&gt;Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 6. Adding ticket control gates 8.png]]
#*Specify the '''PedServices''' object defining the service pedestrians will pass through. Type gates (the name of our '''PedServices''' object) in the '''Service (PedServices)''' field.

Now you can run the model and observe its behavior. You can see that now passengers pass through ticket control gates and sometimes queues are generated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 7. Changing Passenger Arrival Rate Interactively==

In the current model the passenger arrival rate is fixed. However, AnyLogic provides a set of controls enabling changing the model parameters at the model runtime.

Now we will introduce how you can vary parameters of Pedestrian Library objects dynamically. We want to interactively change the passenger arrival rate to assure acceptable performance of service points with hypothetic load. We will introduce the corresponding control element in the presentation to change the rate interactively.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Add a slider to vary passenger arrival rate'''
#Open the '''Controls''' stencil of the '''Palette''' and drag the '''Slider''' [[File:Step 7. Changing passenger arrival rate interactively 1.gif]] element from there into the graphical editor, e.g. to the right of the entrance layout:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Changing passenger arrival rate interactively 2.png]]
#Set the properties of the slider. We want to vary the passenger arrival rate from 0 to 5000 pedestrians per hour. Therefore, specify &lt;tt&gt;5000/hour()&lt;/tt&gt; as slider’s '''Maximum value'''. We type &lt;tt&gt;5000/hour()&lt;/tt&gt; here since the default model time unit in pedestrian models is day. And since we want to define our rate in peds per hour, we divide the value by the constant defining time value equal to one hour according to the current time unit setting.  
#Type &lt;tt&gt;1000/hour()&lt;/tt&gt; as the slider's '''Default value'''. 
#Specify &lt;tt&gt;pedSource.set_rate(value);&lt;/tt&gt; as the slider's '''Action'''. This code will modify the rate of our '''PedSource''' object each time the user will move the slider. &lt;tt&gt;value&lt;/tt&gt; here is the local variable that stores the current value of the slider.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Changing passenger arrival rate interactively 3.png]]

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Add text labels for the slider'''
#Add a title for the slider. Drag the '''Text''' [[File:Step 7. Changing passenger arrival rate interactively 4.gif]] element from the '''Presentation''' palette onto the diagram (above the slider).
#Define the text to be displayed by this label in the '''Text''' property:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Changing passenger arrival rate interactively 5.png]]
#In the same way add two text labels displaying slider's minimum (''0'') and maximum (''5000'') values. Place them below the slider as shown in the figure below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 7. Changing passenger arrival rate interactively 6.png]]

Run the model. Now you can change the passenger rate interactively with the slider. Therefore, you can find the maximal passenger arrival rate that can be served.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Step 8. Adding Ticket Windows==

Now we will expand our model by adding ticket windows.

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the model animation'''
#Draw lines representing ticket windows as shown in the figure below.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding ticket windows 1.png]]
#Add these lines to a new group. Name the group &lt;tt&gt;windowsGroup&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Draw polylines representing queues to ticket windows as shown in the figure below.&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding ticket windows 2.png]]
#The starting point of the polyline is important since it stands for the head of the queue. Place the first point of each polyline near the corresponding service line. 
#Add these polylines to a new group. Name the group &lt;tt&gt;windowsQueuesGroup&lt;/tt&gt;.
#Move &lt;tt&gt;lineBeforeGates&lt;/tt&gt; a little bit down:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding ticket windows 3.png]]

Now we will modify the model flowchart. 

[[File:Step_1._Creating_a_new_model1.gif]] '''Modify the flowchart'''
#Add new objects and connect them as shown below:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding ticket windows 4.png]]
#Configure [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedServices.html PedServices] object. This object will define parameters of a service representing ticket windows. Services defined by this object can be referenced by flowchart objects [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedServices.html PedServices].&lt;/br&gt;Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding ticket windows 5.png]]
#*'''Name''' this object &lt;tt&gt;windows&lt;/tt&gt;.
#*Specify the group containing lines representing services. Type &lt;tt&gt;windowsGroup&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Services (group of lines)''' field.
#*Specify the group containing polylines representing queues to services. Type &lt;tt&gt;windowsQueuesGroup&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Queues (group of lines, polylines)''' field.
#*Specify the service time. Type &lt;tt&gt;triangular(15*second(), 25*second(), 35*second())&lt;/tt&gt; in the '''Delay''' field (you can use [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.help/html/wwanylogic/Using%20Intelli-sense.html code assist]). We assume that service time is triangularly distributed with minimum value of 15 seconds, average value of 25, and maximum value of 35 seconds.
#*Change the '''Service type''' to ''Delay''. ''Delay'' service is defined by a line, which pedestrians should step on for service delay time.
#Configure [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedSelectOutput.html PedSelectOutput] object. We need it to route non-ticketed passengers to ticket windows while other ones – straight to the ticket control gates. '''PedSelectOutput''' object is a decision making block of Pedestrian Library. The pedestrian arrived at the '''PedSelectOutput''' object is forwarded along one of five output ports depending on ratios specified for these ports.&lt;/br&gt;Set up the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding ticket windows 6.png]]
#*Specify ratios for flows going to ticket control gates ('''Chance 1''') and to ticket windows ('''Chance 2''') correspondingly. In this flowchart we assume that the number of passengers that have already bought their tickets is actually significantly higher.
#Configure just added [http://www.xjtek.com/anylogic/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.xj.anylogic.pedestrian_library/help/reference/PedService.html PedService] object. This flowchart object references to '''PedServices''' object defining a service representing subway ticket windows.&lt;/br&gt;Set the following object properties:&lt;/br&gt;[[File:Step 8. Adding ticket windows 7.png]]
#*Specify the '''PedServices''' object defining the service pedestrians will pass through. Type &lt;tt&gt;windows&lt;/tt&gt; (the name of our '''PedServices''' object) in the '''Service (PedServices)''' field.

Run the model. Note that now some passengers first go to the ticket windows to buy a ticket and only then pass through ticket control gates.

==Resources==

Please add links to useful resources on the [[Applied_Science_BTEC_Nationals#Resources|book's front page]] if they are useful for all/several units, or to each unit's chapter if it's more specific.

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] ([[User talk:Ewen|talk]]) 13:46, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

==&quot;To do&quot; list==

Has anyone any requests about which units should be tackled next/first? Does anyone want to volunteer to write a unit? Don't all speak at once...

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 20:04, 24 November 2007 (UTC)


is there any more information you can put on for other subjects 

like forensic psychology or microbiology?

==Contributors==

If you want, add some details about yourself below:

*[[User:Ewen]] teaching First and National BTECs at Swansea College.
*[[User:rah34]] teaching A-level Biology and National BTEC at Woking College.

==Coded punctuation and assignment writing==

When I read the syllabus for BNA applied science, I can see that the learning outcomes are separated by semi-colons or commas. A fellow teacher told me that this was an Edexcel code for compulsory, advisory or voluntary. Does anyone know if this is so, or if there is any good, free information on the web on how to write good assignments to hit all the learning goals. .e.g. key words to be included etc.

19:08, 26 November 2007 [[User:Fossa|Fossa]] ([[User_talk:Fossa|Talk]] | [[Special:Contributions/Fossa|contribs]])

:No, I'm sure the punctuation is merely marking topics and sub-topics within a list.

:[http://www.edexcel.org.uk/VirtualContent/102614/NACD_in_Applied_Science_L3_TS.rtf Tutor support materials] - exemplar material for units 1, 4, 5, 29, 32 and 35. See p14 (and 15-19) for an assignment sheet that can be adapted.

:(I had to Google this sheet - am I alone in finding Edexcel's website to be impossible to navigate efficiently?).

:[http://www.edexcel.org.uk/VirtualContent/103974/Centre_briefing_NSS_2007_2008.pdf NSS Briefing 2007-08] - the final page is the cover sheet for units.

== Textbooks for BTEC students? ==

&quot;I went to a meeting at our college on BTEC course and the lady mentioned that all students who are registered on BTEC course get a free book to help them during the course. I have not been able to get any answers from our exam officer.&quot;

Not my comment, but one that left me thinking: Where are these textbooks then? Any ideas anyone?

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 09:50, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

== Scenarios ==

Can we reject assignments if they do not meet the scenario?

I've had students submit work which was meant to be in the form of a 'Briefing for lawyers' and all they did was churn out the usual essay-style work. At first I thought 'Well, if they want to do the same style of assignment over and over then it's only themselves who get bored...' 

However, it also affected the coverage of Key Skills as the students were essentially re-writing the assignment so that it covered the BTEC criteria but not the KS ones. Now I'm having to issue extra work to cover KS because they met the BTEC criteria, but not the scenario. So, how strongly should we / could we enforce compliance with the scenario?

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] ([[User talk:Ewen|talk]]) 11:06, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

:Answer from Edexcel: If students meet the criteria, it doesn't matter if they ignore the scenario. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] ([[User talk:Ewen|talk]]) 19:17, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

== Course structure ==

We run the full Diploma, the Award and the Certificate, which allows students to combine A-levels and the BTEC if they want. The Award can be done in one year (the first year of the Certificate) or over two years.

The Certificate is in our timetable blocks 'A' and 'C', and Award students have several options:

#Join the Cert Year 1 students in block A in year 1 of the Award, and then join the Cert Year 1 students in block C for Year 2 of the Award.
#Join the Cert Year 1 students in block C in year 1 of the Award, and then join the Cert Year 1 students in block A for Year 2 of the Award.
#Join the Cert Year 1 students in block A and C to complete the Award in one year.

I think a lot of centres enter all their students for the Award initially, in case a student doesn't progress to year 2 they can still claim 'success'.

What other models are out there?

      <comment>Rejected the last text change (by [[Special:Contributions/168.91.255.100|168.91.255.100]]) and restored revision 1600283 by Graeme E. Smith</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Air Loops and Basic HVAC&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is important to note that what a Ground Source Heat Pump does, is affect the temperature of the air within a building. All the other effects are really the consequences of attempting to control the heat of the air within the building. In order to do this, the heat pump has to have some method of affecting the temperature of the air. We call this part of the system the Air Loop because while it is part of the refrigeration system, it is the side that directly affects air temperature.

There are usually two types of heat that can be produced in the Air Loop, Direct Forced Air, where a refrigeration Loop actually heats and cools the air directly, and Radiant heat where the refrigeration loop heats and cools water, which then directly heats and cools the floor, radiating heat or coolness across the expanse of the floor, and thus heating or cooling the air indirectly. Radiant heat is thought to be the more efficient of the two, but people are more likely to have forced air in floors above the basement.

There is one aspect of Ground Source Heat Pump Air Loops that practically eliminates the Option of retrofitting homes that already have forced air systems, and that is the prohibitive cost of re-plumbing the Air Pipes, that connect the furnace to the registers, to incorporate 15% larger pipes, so as to allow for greater air movement, to accommodate the lower heat output of a heat pump with regards to the heat output of an open flame.

This does not affect the efficiency but does affect the renovation cost especially if the basement has been developed, building the HVAC system into the structure and requiring a tear down of the structure to accommodate the larger pipes. Retrofitting in a Forced Air Heat Pump system, requires gutting and re-framing the house to accommodate larger pipes. A combination system might work better as a retrofit where you do radiant heating in the basement, and thus have only to condition the heated air to keep it hot. In such a case the 15% increase in size of the HVAC pipes might be overcome with the heated basement, but no way to calculate this difference has been suggested in my existing manuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">While this page is useful it uses terms, particularly in the section on organization, which are not explained within the book until much later. This could irritate/confuse potential readers who are new to 3D. Perhaps move to a later part of the book or remove technical details (it is far easier to understand &quot;Always name everything in a meaningful way.&quot;)
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

There is too much information for a Noob to swim through and much of it in not educational. I'd like to see less text that is more direct, moving the reader along since this isn't even a tutorial, but a primer. I made major changes to this page today. I hope they are kept.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

'''Descriptivism''' - Observation of how language is used. This is generally the method used in linguistics. (Cf. '''prescriptivism''')

'''Morpheme''' - An individual unit of meaning in a word. For example, the word ''uninterested'' may be analyzed as consisting of three morphemes: ''un-'', ''interest'', and ''-ed''. (Morphemes are sometimes also considered to contain units which have no basic phonological representation, see ''reduplication'', ''truncation'').

'''Morphology''' - The study of how units of meaning are combined together to create words. The basic units of reference in morphology are ''morphemes''.

'''Phone''' - A unit of sound or a gesture used to produce one in a language. Note that different phones may have the same underlying representation in a language (see ''phoneme'').

'''Phoneme''' - A class of phones which contrast with other phonemes in a language. For instance, in English the phoneme /t/ is realized as a plosive at the beginning of a word (e.g. ''term'') but as a flap between vowels in most positions (e.g. ''butter''), while in other languages these two sounds are different phonemes.

'''Phonetics''' - The study of the different types of sounds used in human language and how they are produced and perceived. The basic units of representation in phonetics are ''phones''.

'''Phonology''' - The study of how languages group phones together and use them to encode meaning. The basic units of representation in phonology are ''phonemes''.

'''Prescriptivism''' - Ruling on how language should used. This is common in language instruction but is generally irrelevant to linguistics.  (Cf. '''descriptivism''')

'''Register''' - a different type of speech adopted by a language-user depending on context

'''Rounding''' - &quot;puckering&quot; of the lips while producing a phone, most commonly a vowel</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Changing chord diagrams==

Hello. I'm changing the chord diagrams. If you object please revert to previous diagrams. I'm going to remove the editorial comment about the Hendrix chord. Shouldn't it be left on this talk page or on the users talk page. I've added the scale manual and the technical exercises.

&quot;EDIT: THE CHORD NAME ABOVE IS INCORRECT. It is simply a 7/#9 chord. It has a major third in it, so is NOT a minor chord. The #9 is the same note (sonically) as the minor third, so if it were a minor chord, you could not have a #9. If the author is trying to say that it is a flatted 7th (as opposed to a natural 7th) in the chord spelling, then he should write &quot;Dominant 7/#9&quot;. Writing &quot;Minor 7th&quot; means it's a minor chord w/ a dominant 7th.&quot;

The above is the comment I'm removing. I'm correcting the chord symbol.

Here is the second comment I'm removing. Like the other comment it is correct. I'm changing the chord symbol.

EDIT: ALSO INCORRECT! If it is a 7th chord, you do NOT write &quot;add 9&quot;. Just write: B7/9 or B7/9/13. Use &quot;add 9&quot; if you intend the player to play a triad, with no 7th, but adding the 9th on top, i.e. &quot;B add 9&quot;. Again, as above, this is not a &quot;minor 7th&quot; chord, but a &quot;dominant 7th&quot; chord.

Thanks

      <comment>Schema document comments are in error</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The comments in the schema document appear to be wrong.  XSD patterns must match the entire literal value; it is as if they had implicit start-of-string and end-of-string anchors at the beginning and end of the pattern.  So the zip type is in fact correct.  The zip2 type, by contrast, does not match zip codes but requires a leading caret and a trailing dollar sign.

Does XForms prescribe a different pattern syntax?

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} [[Category:Beef recipes]] [[Category:French recipes]] [[Category:Pepper recipes]]

== Ingredients ==
* 4 (6-8 ounce) beef tenderloin steaks, 1 inch thick
* 2 tbs black peppercorns, cracked
* Salt
* 1/3 cup cognac
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 cup unsalted butter, divided
* 2 tsp olive oil

== Procedure ==
#Sprinkle steaks on both sides liberally with kosher salt. Press peppercorns into both sides of each steak. Let sit 30 minutes or until room temperature.
#Melt 1 tbs butter with oil in a large '''stainless steel''' skillet over medium high heat. Add steaks and cook 5 minutes per side for medium rare, 6 for medium, and 7 for well done. Remove from pan and keep warm.
#Raise heat in pan to high. Turn off the heat, then deglaze pan with cognac. Carefully ignite with a firestick, then swirl the pan until flames die.
#Put heat to medium and whisk continuously to remove fond. Bring to a boil and cook until liquid has reduced by 1/2.
#Whisk in cream. Bring to a boil and cook until liquid has reduced to 1/3 cup.
#Slowly whisk in butter, 1 tbs at a time. Spoon sauce over steaks and serve warm.

== Notes ==

Don't even think about using a nonstick pan. Repeat after me, &quot;You can't build a pan sauce in a nonstick skillet&quot;. Good.

If you don't want to ignite the cognac, you do not have to. I just put it in because it makes a performance that makes people stare at you with amazement.

== Warnings ==

If you do choose to ignite, remember to keep a lid, in case things get out of hand, and a fire extinguisher, in case something bad happens and you need it.</text>

[[:Category:New Books]] I think this category should be deleted because it is not used. It is not a dynamic list and has only 18 pages. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 21:52, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''.

:Yes I know that, but the category is not used and further more the template {{tlx|new}} only shows the list of books in the category. It would be better to delete the Category and make a true list of newly created books. Or maybe I am way off. When are books added to this category? If as soon as they are made, then I am right on. But if books are added when they are complete then this is a good category. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 23:14, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

:: How can you say the category is not used, if you know that? {{tlx|new}} uses the category for its list. Books are added to the list by using {{tlx|new book}}. {{tlx|new book}} is added to new books when they are first created and usually kept on a page for about 2 weeks. Its no different from how {{tlx|CategoryList}} is used on your newly created library page. Should we delete all those categories too than? Before using a dynamic list to generate new books it was done so manually. There is no advantage to deleting this category. There is no other way to see a list of newly created books. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:06, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

:::Ok so they are used as soon as the book is made, even if the book isn't done yet. In that case it could be a dynamic list in order to minimize maintanance. This one we still have to add books to the category. That is why I think we should delete the category. If it isn't possible to make a list like that then I say {{keep}}.  &lt;small&gt;—The preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Arlen22|contribs]]) 12:16, 1 August 2009.&lt;/small&gt;

::::Yes, the meaning is &quot;newly created book&quot;.  (There is, BTW, no such thing as a book being &quot;done&quot; here; unless a book is deleted, further changes are always possible.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 15:54, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep'''. I agree with darklama, it is good to keep a list of newly created books.  I agree there are difficulties, I think lots of times books don't get added to it, and it seems to me books stay in there longer then two weeks.  But overall I think it is helpful.

This page was tagged as a speedy by [[User:Geoff Plourde|Geoff Plourde]] (3 August 2009). I think that there is some content that shouldn't be simply deleted and that the stub is of value and too recent (12 June 2009) to be merely deleted, so I changed the speedy request for a VFD.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:33, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' I have toned down the links and provided 2 other alternatives (random selections from a search on the topic) so the spam issue is partially addressed.
: In any case the page is too recent and does have content that shouldn't be lost. I feel again that talking with the page creator and educating him would be more productive (even if there is some suspicions of bad faith) that doesn't affect the content nor the value of the subject the page covers. The creator was welcomed and an attempt to request more input was made but it seems not replied to.
: I also urge that someone that can would check the page history and if the 3 contributors that attempted to flood the page with the same link are identical or from the same range a block of the most recent ones should be considered as the action demonstrates bad faith in a coordinated way.
: Finally, the page should be renamed (haven't searched for other works that could use the content) or could be merged.
: In any case a good catch by [[User:Geoff Plourde|Geoff Plourde]]...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:42, 3 August 2009 (UTC)
:{{comment}} I don't care either way, but... Wikibooks does not seem the appropriate place to stash a one page handout on men's suits. Now, if someone wanted to write a book on suits/clothing, that's another matter. Maybe we should move this to userspace? [[User:Geoff Plourde|Geoff Plourde]] ([[User talk:Geoff Plourde|talk]]) 20:10, 3 August 2009 (UTC)
::{{comment}} Only the owner of the user space can make that decission. In any case we do support stubs on this project no one is expected to commit to the full creation of a work. If some content is usable we should strive to keep it, see the above discussion about [[English Grammar 2]].
::Since the VFD was not initiated only due to the speedy (if so I would have talked to you directly) but due to the multiple accounts that engaged on the action you detected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompTIA CompTIA] Security+ certification designates knowledgeable professionals in the field of security, one of the fastest-growing fields in IT. Security threats are increasing in number and severity, and the gap between the need for security professionals and qualified IT personnel is the largest of any IT specialty, according to a 2008 CompTIA study. Even in a troubled economy, most businesses plan to maintain or increase their investment in security. 

CompTIA Security+ is an international, vendor-neutral certification that proves competency in system security, network infrastructure, access control and organizational security. Major organizations that employ CompTIA Security+ certified staff include Booz Allen Hamilton, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Motorola, Symantec, Telstra, Hitachi, Ricoh, Lockheed Martin, Unisys, Hilton Hotels Corp., General Mills, the U.S. Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines. 

Although not a prerequisite, it is recommended that CompTIA Security+ candidates have at least two years of technical networking experience, with an emphasis on security. The CompTIA Network+ certification is also recommended.

# [[/Compliance and Operational Security/]]
# [[/Threats and Vulnerabilities/]]

== Test Details ==
Number of questions: 100 

Length of test: 90 minutes 

Passing score: 750 on a scale of 100-900 

Recommended experience: CompTIA Network+ certification and two years of technical networking experience, with an emphasis on security.

{{closed|Closed as [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete'''.  I've left this up here for months and no objections to deletion have been registered here or on the below referenced talk page.  Wikibooks is not Wikisource and the material on these pages is at [[s:Manual of Gardening|Manual of Gardening]] and [[s:Home Vegetable Gardening|Home Vegetable Gardening]] should anyone have need of it.  Anything missing from those texts is being pulled from Project Gutenberg and not here.  Finally, if SB Johnny, as a major contributor to [[Horticulture]], isn't interested in them, then I feel safe deleting them. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:08, 4 August 2009 (UTC)}}
The contents of this category have just been sitting there and it seems like, from the contents of [[Wikibooks talk:Pages to be transwikied/Gardening]], that they are abandoned and other source material is being used to populate Wikisource, rather than the pages in the above category.  At least that's the way I interpret it. [[Talk:Gardening]] also indicates that a new book would be started ([[Horticulture]]) that would not use the pages in this category.  So they are no longer being transwikied and they have been dismissed as not acceptable for a merge.  I humbly propose they be deleted rather than sit in limbo. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:13, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

* '''Delete'''. These pages has been in limbo a long time. Wikisource has had plenty of time to transwiki them if they were going to use them. The Horticulture book has also had plenty of time to adopt them if they were going to be used. The Gardening pages are part of a book that became public domain due to its age and that is why it was suppose to have been transfered to Wikisource to begin with from what I understand. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:43, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Zeus is associated with capricorn and Hera with libra? You might want to double check that because I thoroughly believe that to be untrue. If anything it is the opposite. But in reality, Hera is associated with Capricorn and Saturn and Zeus is associated with Aries or even Libra. Zeus in my mind is positively an Aries because of the derivation of the word zeus which is yeu or youth. Aries is the most youthful of all the signs! I don't really have a reason why Hera takes after Kronos other than that I am exactly like Hera and I am a Capricorn. I just see the saturn in her nature. But I would just do a little more research into this idea to make sure that what makes it to the page is solid fact.</text>

Could we talk about the changes to the title of [[Dual Booting Microsoft Windows]], which to the best of my knowledge is grammatically correct and the proper order, but maybe I am missing something.  Before I make anther change I thought we could talk so I could see a bit better what the difficulty is. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:52, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

==The International Phonetic Alphabet== 

The '''International Phonetic Alphabet''' is a system of phonetic notation which provides a standardized system of representing the sounds of spoken languages. It may be represented visually using charts, which are given here for reference:

===Consonants===
Pulmonic consonants are those made by obstructing the glottis (the space between the vocal cords) or oral cavity (the mouth) and either simultaneously or subsequently letting out air from the lungs. Where symbols appear in pairs, the one to the right represents a voiced consonant. Shaded areas denote articulations judged as impossible.

Coarticulated consonants are sounds that involve two simultaneous places of articulation (are pronounced using two parts of the vocal tract). In English, the [w] in &quot;went&quot; is a coarticulated consonant, because it is pronounced by rounding the lips and raising the back of the tongue. Other languages, such as French and Swedish, have different coarticulated consonants.

Non-pulmonic consonants are sounds whose airflow is not dependent on the lungs. These include clicks (found in the Khoisan languages of Africa), implosives (found in languages such as Swahili) and ejectives (found in many Amerindian and Caucasian languages).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
[[File:Appalachian Region of US.png|thumb|375px|right|The Appalachian Region of the US]]
Country music is a uniquely american genre of music that can trace its roots back to earlier european folk songs that the arriving immigrants brought with them. It developed in the Appalachians and surrounding states; changing the forms and sounds of the earlier folk songs until the music reflected the conditions that these early american settlers experienced. The music itself has never stopped absorbing elements from other genres such as blues, ragtime, jazz, rock and contemporary folk. It is this vitality that has kept country music at the heart of american culture. 

===History===

Country music, like most early folk music, was passed down orally from generation to generation; with each adding to the existing tradition. The guitar, being cheap and portable, was ideal for country musicians and from the earliest days has been associated with the music. 

It was the invention of the phonograph and radio that led to the creation of the first national country stars The Carter Family. The Carter Family also sung gospel, Victorian ballads and vaudeville songs. The guitar solo in their song &quot;Wildwood Flower&quot; is an early example of characteristics that are still to be found in country lead breaks.

Country guitarists also absorbed elements from the blues and slide guitar started to be featured shortly after the success of the Carter Family. Jimmie Rodgers (1897-1933) was the first solo star of country music and his guitar style is a mixture of country alternating bass and the blues form. 

Country music took on some on the elements of the big band era of the 1930s. The growth of bigger bands that included instruments such as drums and saxophones led to the creation of Western Swing. Whereas the music of the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers had retained some of the earlier folk ballad qualities; Western Swing was primarily for dancing.

===Guitars===  

Acoustic guitars have been a firm favourite for country musicians since the 1920s. The &quot;open&quot; resonating sound of these guitars suit the country and western chordal style. The Gibson L-5 was popular (the instrument played by Maybelle Carter) as were Martin guitars. It musn't be overlooked that Gibsons and Martins are professional marque guitars and that many players would have started on cheaper models by other manufacturers. 

The Dobro Resonator guitar was also used from the 1930s onwards. Its unique timbre appealed to country guitarists and its volume allowed it to be heard amongst the expanding line-up of instruments.

Other instruments that are commonly used in country music are the fiddle and banjo.

==Exercise One==

This exercise uses these chords:

&lt;gallery perrow=3&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;Courier New&quot;&gt;
File:G major chord for guitar (open).png|'''G'''
File:C major chord for guitar (open).png|'''C'''
File:D major chord for guitar (open).png|'''D'''
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This is an exercise for alternating the bass. It is recommended that this exercise be played without a plectrum. Use the thumb of your right hand to play the alternating bass notes. The right hand fingers must also form a &quot;claw&quot; and be placed on the three treble strings to start this exercise. The ring finger of the right hand always takes the highest note. After playing the bass note with your thumb; slightly lift your right hand fingers to sound the treble strings. Don't pluck or pull away your right hand. A slight lift of your right hand index, middle and ring finger is enough to sound the chord and then return your hand back for the next lift. Practice this exercise slowly for accuracy especially placing the claw correctly and ensuring that after the lift the fingers are only millimeters away and ready to be placed again. There should be no movement of the forearm or wrist; all the work is done by the fingers. The left hand holds down the chords as shown above. Most tab exercises will have chord diagrams that show the chords to be used.

==Essential Country Guitarists and Recordings==
[[File:Jimmie Rodgers.jpg|thumb|right|The Country and Western performer Jimmie Rodgers]]
* The Carter Family - a long career has led to many Carter Family recordings but the early recordings between 1927 and 1941 on the Victor label are considered to be the best of the original Carter family line-up. Some of the Carter Family's radio performances are in the public domain and can be found on-line for listening or download.

* Jimmie Rodgers - his first hit record was &quot;Blue Yodel (T for Texas)&quot;. The first country solo artist to achieve national fame in the US. 

* Hank Williams - the writer of &quot;Your Cheating Heart&quot; and &quot;Hey, Good Lookin&quot;

* Willie Nelson - the country performer and song-writer who wrote &quot;Crazy&quot; (Patsy Cline).

* Chet Atkins - one of the architects of the &quot;Nashville&quot; sound. A guitarist of wide skills who has performed on the records of Elvis Presely and the Everley Brothers; as well as issuing his own solo releases and duos with the guitarist Jimmy Reed. 

* Leon McAuliff - one of the great Western Swing steel guitarists. Played with Bob Wills' Texas Playboys.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the '''Wikibooks Driving Guide'''.  This book covers the basics of driving, including basic driver safety, advanced driving techniques, and relevant vehicle maintenance topics.  It is a work in progress; refer to chapter 10 for ways in which you may help improve it.

== Content ==
The '''Wikibooks Driving Guide''' contains content suitable for both new and experienced drivers; as well as for mentors to new drivers, such as parents with teenagers reaching the driving age.  All content in the '''Wikibooks Driving Guide''' is suitable for all classes of drivers.

Within, you will find several topics including vehicle safety, technique, and maintenance across a wide range of driving conditions including personal, professional, and precision or &quot;racing&quot; conditions.  When executed correctly and with proper judgment, all techniques are useful in all driving conditions.  Some conditions, such as precision driving for motorsports, will require the use of specialized techniques more than others; other condition, such as personal &quot;street&quot; driving, will demand more conservative and generalized driving technique but occasionally benefit from advanced specialized techniques to avoid or neutralize hazardous conditions.

The content covered within serves only to raise driver awareness in the field of driving.  Specialized, hands-on driver's education courses for a variety of driving styles exist.  For example, specific Advanced Driver's Education courses cover vehicle dynamics and handling techniques as they apply to unpredictable hazardous situations in every-day driving conditions.  Specialized autocrossing driver's education courses cover vehicle dynamics and handling techniques under extreme road conditions and at maximized speeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''present subjunctive''' in Spanish is formed by adding the following endings to the stems of verbs:
-ar: -e, -es, -e, -emos,- éis, -en
-er/-ir: -a, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, -an

Verbs that are stem changing/ boot verbs in the present indicative will do the same in the present subjunctive.
If a verb has an irregular yo form in the present indicative that is the base form for the present subjunctive; hence tener, tengo, becomes:  tenga, tengas, tenga, etc., or oír, oigo, becomes:  oiga, oigas, oiga, etc.

Verbs that end in –uir, like huir, which have a ‘y’ between stem and ending in the boot (all forms but nosotros and vosotros) in the present indicative function as yo irregulars:  all six forms in the present subjunctive have the ‘y’:  huya, huyas, huya, huyamos, huyáis, huyan.

For phonetic reasons there are various spell changes.  The –car, -gar, -zar, -guar yo spell changes in the preterit occur in all six forms of the present subjunctive.  Sacar:  saque, saques, saque, etc.  Llegar:  llegue, llegues, llegue, etc.  Lanzar:  lance, lances, lance, etc.  Averiguar:  averigüe, averigües, averigüe, etc.  Also yo spell changes from the present indicative will occur in all six forms in the present subjunctive for:  -ger/gir, consonent+-zar, -guir.  Escoger:  escoja, escojas, escoja, etc.  Vencer:  venza, venzas, venza, etc.  Seguir:  siga, sigas, siga, etc.

-ir stem changing verbs will have a change in the nosotros and vosotros forms, with the ‘o’ in the stem becoming a ‘u’ or the ‘e’ becoming an ‘i’.   Morir:  muera, mueras, muera, muramos, muráis, mueran.  Sentir:  sienta, sientas, sienta, sintamos, sintáis, sientan. 

There are six irregular verbs in the present subjunctive:
Ser:  sea, seas, sea, seamos, seáis, sean
Ir:  vaya, vayas, vaya, vayamos, vayáis, vayan
Saber:  sepa, sepas, sepa, sepamos, sepáis, sepan
Haber:  haya, hayas, haya, hayamos, hayáis, hayan
Estar:  esté, estés, esté, estemos, estéis, estén
Dar:  dé, des, dé, demos, deis, den

The '''imperfect subjunctive''' in Spanish is formed by adding the following endings to the third person plural of the preterit after removing the ‘-ron’
-ra, -ras, -ra, ’-ramos, -rais, -ran

Hence hablar, hablaron, becomes:  hablara, hablaras, hablara, habláramos, hablarais, hablaran

Or vivir, vivieron, becomes:  viviera, vivieras, viviera, viviéramos, vivierais, vivieran
An alternative, less used, set of endings is also available:
-se, -ses, -se, ’-semos, -seis, -sen

The '''future subjunctive''' (not commonly used but an accepted form), like the imperfect subjunctive, is formed using the third person plural of the preterit after removing the ‘-ron’.  The endings are:
-re, -res, -re, ’-remos, -reis, -ren

==1. Give a brief history of the art of decorative knotting.==
Macramé, the modern art of decorating with knots, is believed to have originated with 13th-century Arab weavers. These artisans knotted the excess thread and yarn along the edges of hand-loomed fabrics into decorative fringes on bath towels, shawls, and veils. The word macramé is derived from the Arabic migramah (مقرمة), believed to mean &quot;striped towel&quot;, &quot;ornamental fringe&quot; or &quot;embroidered veil.&quot; After the Moorish conquest, the art was taken to Spain, and then spread through Europe. It was first introduced into England by Kathleen Koons at the court of Queen Mary, the wife of William of Orange, in the late 17th century.

Sailors made macramé objects at sea, and sold and bartered them when they landed, thus spreading the art to places like China and the New World. Macramé remained a popular pastime with 19th- century British and American seamen, who called it square knotting after the knot they most preferred in making hammocks, bell fringes, and belts.

Macramé reached its zenith in the Victorian era. Sylvia's Book of Macramé Lace, a favorite at that time, urged its readers &quot;to work rich trimmings for black and coloured costumes, both for home wear, garden parties, seaside ramblings, and balls- fairylike adornments for household and underlinens ...&quot; Few Victorian homes went unadorned.

While the craze for macramé waned in later years, it is now popular again, for making wall hangings, articles of clothing, bedspreads, small jean shorts, tablecloths, draperies, plant hangers and other furnishings.

==2. What is a good macramé cord? ==
Cotton seine twine is recommended for the beginner because with this material, the patterns are easier to see and the knots are easy to tighten.

==3. Know three kinds of cords that are good and why they are good.== 
Common materials used in macramé include cotton twine, hemp, leather or yarn. 

;Cotton twine: Soft, flexible, easy to obtain, cheap
;Hemp: Very strong, easily acquired, natural look
;Leather: Strong, stiff, doesn't fray
;Yarn: Various colors, cheap, flexible

==4.  Know the basic knots used in macramé. Know two variations of each of these knots. ==

==5. How is the overhand knot useful in macramé? ==
Overhand knots can be used to tie two cords together at the bottom of a piece, to fasten a cord to a bead or pearl, or to serve as a decorative knot in the pattern.

==6. How much cord is needed to reach the desired length of the finished product? ==
The length of cord needed for a finished product is directly dependent on the types of knots used.  It also depends on how much knotting is done on a given cord.  Anchor cords will have fewer (if any) knots compared to working cords.  A general rule of thumb is to allow yourself five times more cord than the length of the product.  A better guideline is to experiment.  Tie a short section (at least a couple of inches (10 cm) long).  Measure it, and then untie it and measure the amount of cord used.  If 2 inches of your sample required 12 inches of cord, you will need six times as much cord.

==7. Make a sampler wall hanging using the essential knots and using at least two variations, such as the horizontal half-hitch, vertical half-hitch, or the half knot.== 
==8. Make two other items of your choice using the square knot, the double half-hitch, and two variations of either or both items. ==

[[File:Vatican stamp type A1 with frame.jpg|right|480px]]
&lt;br&gt;
{{drop|P }}&lt;font size=3&gt;ostage meters first appeared experimentally at the end of the 19th century and came into general use worldwide starting in the 1920s. By the 1960s more mail was being franked by postage meter than with traditional adhesive stamps. The trend continues today as mechanical postage meters are displaced by newer and more versatile digital franking systems and machines.



This is a catalog of all the different types of postage meter stamps ever used to frank mail in the world. It organizes and categorizes the stamps by their appearance (design format) rather than the meter model that printed them. It is thus a STAMP catalog for use primarily by stamp collectors and is not a meter (machine) catalog. It is an expansion of &lt;i&gt;The International Postage Meter Stamp Catalog&lt;/i&gt;, written and published by Joel Hawkins and Rick Stambaugh in 2005, and its 2008 Supplement.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:10, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

:Hi Panic, Thanks for your welcome to Wikibooks. I could use guidance with two issues: how to upload images and place them on the page, and how to create 'chapters' and link them to the introduction/table of contents. Thanks, Rick

== Image Uploading ==
I got you email, for uploading images into the project you should prefer using [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Commons] (you can use the images from there). You can also get more insight in the why this is best from the discussion going on on the [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Restriction_of_image_uploads]].&lt;br&gt;
To upload an image to Commons use [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Upload the Commons upload page] it is easy and has a lot more information on how to proceed.&lt;br&gt;
For info on using images see [[Editing Wikitext/Pictures]] if you still can do what you intend make a post into the in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]] (you can use your sandbox, see above about it, to do the tests).
PS: remember to sign your posts :) Hope this helps...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:18, 7 August 2009 (UTC)


== Copyright problems with [[:{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE:File:Belgium K2.jpg}}||File:File:Belgium K2.jpg|File:Belgium K2.jpg}}]] ==

{{mbox|type=warning|msg=
Thank you for uploading [[:{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE:File:Belgium K2.jpg}}||File:File:Belgium K2.jpg|File:Belgium K2.jpg}}]]. Some copyright information is needed for compliance with [[w:copyright|copyright law]] and Wikibooks' [[WB:MEDIA|media policy]].

Please add copyright and source information on the [[:{{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE:File:Belgium K2.jpg}}||File:File:Belgium K2.jpg|File:Belgium K2.jpg}}|description page]] by using Wikibooks' [[WB:FILES|copyright templates]]; there is no need to upload files again.

See '''[[Help:Uploading files]]''' for help and [{{fullurl:Special:Log/upload|user={{PAGENAMEE}}}} your file uploads]. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me, or ask in the [[WB:HELP|assistance reading room]].

Thank you. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:26, 1 October 2009 (UTC)}}

:I see you have added &quot;Permission&quot; and then your name to the image. This isn't what you need to do. You need to attach the license you are releasing the image under - please see [[WB:MEDIA]] for guidance. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 07:46, 2 October 2009 (UTC)

: I am new at this. I don't even know how to reply to messages. I hope this (editing the narrative) is the correct way. I just replaced &quot;{{Richard Stambaugh}}&quot; with this &quot;{{PD-Richard Stambaugh}}&quot; for the image under question. Thanks for the help. Rick

::Hi, the way to do it is like this &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;Permission= {{PD-user|[[User:Rickstambaugh|Richard Stambaugh]]}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;. I've changed this now for you. Thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

== Formatting ==

When categorising [[International Postage Meter Stamp Catalog/Finland]] I did some formatting that I wanted to bring to your attention. I replaced the multiple newlines (which won't display consistently) with {{tlx|clear}} and removed the font tags that colour text blue. That colour coincides with the default link colour and can therefore be confusing. It would be better to use book-wide style-sheets that will hopefully soon be implemented. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:53, 22 February 2010 (UTC)

== Great Job ==
Great job, Rick! We, at [[w:ru:Википедия:Проект:Филателия|Philately Project]] of Russian Wikipedia, appreciate very much your 'opus magnum' and look forward to being able to enjoy the Soviet Union and Russia sections of the Postage Meter Stamp Catalog. Could you prioritize that? Maybe we would even be able to add something on the subject. BTW I have a small collection of Soviet postage meter stamps of the 1970-ies. Eventually it would be nice to have the Catalog translated into Russian in ru.wikibooks.org, what do you think? Sincerely, Leonid Dzhepko. --[[User:Л.П. Джепко|Л.П. Джепко]] ([[User talk:Л.П. Джепко|talk]]) 08:30, 27 February 2010 (UTC)

Hi Leonid, Yes I can re-prioritize countries and will do Russia and USSR out of my usual sequence. I appreciate help from people who know more than I do and look forward to your input. I am in the middle of France which will probably take me another two weeks. I then must do the United States for an earlier request. The U.S. could take me a long time, maybe two months. I will do Russia and Soviet Union after the U.S. That will be about May-June. Best regards, Rick
: OK, thank you! D'you know that you can add yr signature automatically by clicking the button 'Your signature with timestamp' from the middle of the row right above this editing window? --[[User:Л.П. Джепко|Л.П. Джепко]] ([[User talk:Л.П. Джепко|talk]]) 15:29, 27 February 2010 (UTC)

No I didn't. Thanks for the tip. I just printed out the guide to Wiki markup buttons. Maybe this will speed up my editing.--[[User:Rickstambaugh|Rickstambaugh]] ([[User talk:Rickstambaugh|talk]]) 15:34, 27 February 2010 (UTC)

: Hi Rick, I notice that you have made Russia and USSR. Thank you for both, they are very informative. Hopefully, you would not mind my minor clarifications/changes regarding your wording (which I dare to make based on my knowledge of Russian and Ukrainian). If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me or change them if you do not agree. Rgds, Leonid Dzhepko. --[[User:Л.П. Джепко|Л.П. Джепко]] ([[User talk:Л.П. Джепко|talk]]) 12:30, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

:: Rick, I cannot identify in yr catalogue a USSR meter stamp, which can be seen [http://www.mirmarok.ru/prim/view_article/267/ there] (machine # 9508; 7th image from top). --[[User:Л.П. Джепко|Л.П. Джепко]] ([[User talk:Л.П. Джепко|talk]]) 07:07, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

== West Indies ==

Hi Rick,
New to wikibooks, so still finding out how to approach things.
I'm editor of the British West Indies Study Circle Bulletin (www.bwisc.org) and personally a keen collector of Jamaica (and philatelic author).
Our recent journal made mention of you wikibook and I may receive a trickle of information (one so far)which I will share with you.
However, I have produced something for Jamaica myself
http://www.jamaicaphilately.info/80_Meter-Marks/Jamaica_Meter-Marks.pdf
and seek your advice on how you would like me proceed with it (if at all).
Regards

Steve</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page is a refrence for all opengl functions   it will be big  but it will be easy to navagate when finished.  I do not want to split or have the page split for size. It will make it much harder to find the functions if it is split.

The idea is that each function,type and classes documentation will be formated like this
* possable function use
* what it dose
* short example of ussage context  ie  3 to 9 lines of commented code

Now let's start with real modeling. In this tutorial we will study in greater depth how to model using box modeling work flow. Let start with a swan chair. It is great piece to model for its a popular piece of furniture so reference images are easy to find. It also have a simple geometric structure so its shape easy to grasp and also contains simple edge and face loop flow so as not to necessitate difficult edge loop face loop flow herding techniques.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SwanChairSceneInBlender.png|400px]]|2=Scene with the chair model as seen in Blender}}

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SwanChairSceneRenderedWithBlender.jpg|400px]]|2=Rendered Scene with the chair}}

The techniques learned could also be used to model other chairs (Example: the Egg chair, Tulip chair or Parson's chair which is advised to be modeled too) and other subjects.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== alternatives to single Program Counter ==

[[Microprocessor Design/Instruction Set Architectures]] mentions
&quot;there are processor architectures, for instance the CDP1802, that do not have a single Program Counter&quot;
[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Microprocessor_Design%2FInstruction_Set_Architectures&amp;diff=1490949&amp;oldid=1490943]

The [[Wikipedia: RCA 1802]] certainly proves it is not *necessary* to have a special PC register separated from the other registers.
What other processor architectures do not have a single Program Counter?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:29, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

:I'll grant that there are not many out there. The 1802 had a register that was set to be the program counter by convention, and another that was used by convention for subroutine calls. But any GP register could act as program counter. If we go back to archaic computing, there were a number of computers without static storage that did not have a program counter at all, but rather the instruction would end with the address of the next instruction; program store was a spinning drum, and the last word of the instruction was the encoded position on the drum surface of the next instruction. In the PDP-11, one of the registers, R7, was the PC by convention; I am unsure whether that was convention only or could be changed in software. That is, however, all I can remember off the top of my head. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 06:43, 5 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is meant to make students aware of the indestructible properties and make use of them in developing their analytical skills. ''''Nothing can be analyzed without finding its properties.'''' This article lets one to analyze anything completely and systematically through the indestructible properties which can be discovered through each of those one could analyze.

== Developing Analytical Skills Using the Indestructible Properties ==
# Think on the '''divisibility''' property which is discoverable through each of those you could analyze. Divisibility is the property without which one can neither be a part nor be a whole. 'Divisibility' should not be confused with 'division'. Note: Divisibility is the property and division is not a property.Nothing can be quantified in an indivisible universe.
# Think on the '''comparability''' property which is discoverable through each of those you could analyze. Comparability is the property without which one can neither be an equivalence nor be a difference.
# Think on the '''connectivity''' property which is discoverable through each of those you could analyze. Connectivity is the property without which one can neither be a link nor be a limit. Note: The one without any connection to others has no limits. One has no limits in the absence of the other ones.
# Think on the '''disturbability''' property which is discoverable through each of those you could analyze. Disturbability is the property without which one can neither be a influence nor be a sensation.
# Think on the '''reorderability''' property which is discoverable through each of those you could analyze. Reorderability is the property without which one can neither be an origin nor be a derivative.
# Think on the '''substitutability''' property which is discoverable through each of those you could analyze. Substitutability is the property without which one can neither be a substitute nor be misfit.
# Think on the '''satisfiability''' property which is discoverable through each of those you could analyze. Satisfiablity is the property without which one can neither be a requirement nor be a fulfillment.

One would become a perfect analyst by learning to discover and investigate these indestructible properties. Illustrative examples are given below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,
My name is Rick (Richard) Stambaugh, and I am the author and co-author of several books about 'meter' stamp collecting, a specialty area of the stamp collecting hobby. My goal with Wikibooks is to turn my magnum opus, The International Postage Meter Stamp Catalog, by Joel Hawkins and myself, 2005, into a repository of meter stamp taxonomy that all collectors can use freely, update and expand.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Line - A line is simply a series of dots, or points, in space.
That line can be straight (although some would argue that a 
line can never be truly straight) or curved. Lines are used to delineate objects as in a line drawing, or used to create graphs, or used to outline areas as in a framed effect. Imaginary lines are created when two areas of different colors, textures, or values meet to create a line between those effects.
* Colour - Hues, which are represented by the shades (add black), tones (middle ranges), and tints (add white) of any given color. Get a color wheel. You'll love yourself for that effort, because a color wheel can help you to determine various color schemes such as contrasting colors, triadic schemes, etc.
* Volume - Although volume is often represented by three-dimensional objects, a two-dimensional designer or artist can create the illusion of volume (and, therefore, depth and/or distance) through various techniques like perspective, shading, and highlights.
* Movement - Movement is not animation, although animation illustrates movement. Movement is how you as a designer move the viewer's eye through a space with the line, contrast, volume, and the placement of objects within a design (composition).
* Space - Space comes in two flavors: Positive space, which is represented by highlights or by an object; Negative space, which is represented by open space or by shadow. The balance of space creates a composition.
* Texture - Texture is illusion in two-dimensional design. In other words, the designer/artist creates the 'feel' of a brick, water, or other object through drawing or through photographic representation. Collage artists may represent texture through the actual object, such as sandpaper that represents sand.
* Value - Value is light and dark and all the shades in between (gray scale). The use of this element creates contrast.
* Typography - In design, topography is an element; however, it's an element created by other elements such as line, space, volume, and value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vehicle maintenance''' plays an important role in driving.  Unmaintained vehicles not only experience more faults and require more costly repairs; but they present huge safety hazards to the driver and others in and around the vehicle, including passengers, other vehicles, and pedestrians.  Maintenance includes daily inspections and routine service, as well as materials selection for parts such as tires, brakes, and fluids.

'''Psycholinguistics''' is the study of how people understand language.  It can cover a number of fields, and provide important insights into our understanding of language.

== Methodologies ==

== Verbal Behavior ==

B.F.Skinner's Verbal Behavior represents a conceptual, theoretical extension of his powerful inductive approach innovated with lower organisms. This approach posits that language, or what Skinner calls Verbal Behavior, is best explored in terms of functional relationships.

This view represents a view opposed to the traditional hypothetico-deductive approaches to language that are largely driven by speculative theories and not integrative, data-driven theories.

Skinner's view of Verbal Behavior was widely viewed to have been &quot;demolished&quot; by Noam Chomsky's critique. However, astute readers will have noted that little of what Chomsky said actually applied to Skinner's work. See, for example, Ken Maccorquodale's On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior
(http://www.behavior.org/computer-modeling/maccorquodale/maccorquodale1.cfm) for a general statement of the widely held perception that Chomsky said almost nothing about Skinner's work. 

Skinner's inductively driven conceptual extension to human verbal behavior has seen an enormous resurgence in applied settings in the treatment of autistic children who were considered &quot;untreatable&quot; by normal approachs.

Skinner's position is that human verbal behavior is, like other behavior, driven by the four-term contingency analysis discovered and refined in laboratory work: one or more motivating operations (MO), one or more discriminative stimuli (Sd), one or more responses (R), and one or more reinforcing stimuli (Sr) make up the four term contingency. Human verbal behavior is analyzable in this functional context. 

Children, then, learn language as a function of thousands of instances of verbal prompting, shaping and reinforcement.  

Grammar is universal in the sense that the world is universal. The same speakers in all of the world deal with the same world and so speak about it in similar ways. Human language is too young to be a part of the human genetic endowment.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Driver safety''' involves many factors including education and experience as well as traffic law, road etiquette, and driver habits.  By developing and expanding a good sense of all of these through education and experience, a driver becomes much more safe and effective on the road, not only able to avoid collisions and hazards but also able to compensate for poor road and traffic conditions.  This reduces the number of accidents, and also allows drivers to keep moving and prevent backups when encountering and reacting to blocked lanes, poor drivers, and other emergency situations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We know why we tour as tourists. You know why you may choose some parts of the globe over others by reasons such as family, cheap prices and activities- but do you specifically know why we tour? 

Tourism varies a number of ways: time, number of tourists, and different reasons being just some. For example, you may spend 2 weeks in Borth which has thousands of tourists, or you may tour in the Amazon for a month where there are little tourists and for the purpose of ecotourism. 

Because of recent falls in the economy and general decrease of salary, many people are looking for cheaper places to tour. This means more money for the cheaper resorts, that tend to be Mass Tourism destinations and a big company. 

Tourism can have positive and negative effects: money, jobs and a good recognition are common positives that tourism brings. However, Global warming, pollution and destruction of habitat are all negatives people are concerned about. Solutions are being carried out to make tourism more eco-friendly. Eco-tourism helps local communities, wildlife and produces much less pollution than mass tourism. But are the general public willing to tour in eco-tourist destinations?

== Introduction ==
Quick: take a look around yourself and see how many examples of writing are within view.

While languages have been in use for tens of millenia, writing has had a comparatively short lifespan.

An individual unit of writing is known as a ''glyph''. Similarly to the concept of the phoneme in phonology, we can speak of ''graphemes'' and ''allographs'' in orthography. A grapheme is a fundamental unit of written language, and an allograph is any acceptable instantiation of the grapheme in writing. It is standard linguistic practice to enclose graphemic representations in angular brackets &amp;lt;&amp;gt;. &lt;!--note: angular brackets may be interpreted as html unless you use the escape codes &amp;lt;&amp;gt; --&gt;

== Directionality ==

The most common directions for written language are horizontal rows of ''left-to-right'' (''ltr'') or ''right-to-left'' (rtl) text. Examples of languages written left-to-right include English, Hindi, and Thai. Examples of right-to-left writing include Arabic, Hebrew, and N'ko.

Vertical writing systems are also found, usually going from top-to-bottom (though bottom-to-top is attested). These vertical rows may be ordered either left-to-right or right-to-left. The Mongolian script (not in much use anymore) is a vertical script ordered left-to-right, while Japanese may be written either horizontally from left-to-right or in vertical columns from right to left. Bottom-to-top writing includes some instances of the Berber script Tifinagh.

In rare cases writing systems may use combinations of these directions. The term ''boustrophedon'' (meaning 'ox-turning' in Greek) generally refers to horizontal scripts in which lines alternate for directionality, and the characters themselves may be mirrored.

== Types of spelling systems ==

Phonemic, morpho-phonemic, defective, complex

== Alphabets ==
[[Image:Abkhaz Uslar alphabet.JPG|thumb|300px|alt=chart of consonants in the Abkhaz Uslar alphabet|Alphabets treat consonants and vowels equally.]]

Given that you are reading this book, you are probably already familiar with at least one alphabet. The concept underlying alphabets is essentially that they represent the sounds of a language rather than the meaning, and that consonants and vowels are treated in the same way, i.e. the letters &lt;a,e,i,o,u&gt; are not different in any fundamental way from the letters &amp;lt;b,c,d,f,g...&amp;gt;.

One might say that idealized alphabets assign one letter per segment, whether consonant or vowel. In reality many alphabets deviate from this somewhat &amp;ndash; for instance, in English we use the ''digraph'' (two-letter combination) &lt;sh&gt; to represent the single sound /ʃ/.

== Abjads ==
[[Image:Phoenicianletters.png|thumb|alt=The first five letters of the Phoenician abjad|Abjads mostly only represent consonants.]]
An ''abjad'' (also known as a ''consonentary'' or a ''consonental alphabet'') is a writing system where words are generally written only with characters for consonants. The Modern Hebrew writing system employs an abjad; for example, the Modern Hebrew word /zanav/ 'tail' is written &lt;זנב&gt; (right-to-left), which would correspond to &lt;znv&gt; in English. Characters for certain certain vowels may also be used, and system of vowel marking&amp;mdash;or ''vocalization''&amp;mdash;may be available for use but not usually employed.

Abjads  are a less common form of writing system; however, most modern alphabets as well as many other writing systems have descended from the Proto-Canaanite alphabet used in the late bronze age. The most prominent abjads still in use today are the Arabic and Hebrew writing systems.

== Abugidas ==
[[Image:Brahmika.svg|thumb|200px|alt=Brāhmī &quot;ka&quot; and its alternate forms for other vowels|Abugidas use glyphs for consonants which are modified depending on the following vowel.]]
An ''abugida'' (or ''alphasyllabary'') is similar to an abjad in which vocalization is obligatory &amp;ndash; consonants are the basic graphemic units, but they are modified (usually with diacritics) depending on what vowel comes after them. Vowels without preceding consonants may be written either with separate independent graphemes, or by using the usual vowel diacritics on a ''null consonant'' glyph. Examples of languages which use abugidas include Hindi, Thai, and Amharic.

In many abugidas consonants have a &quot;default&quot; vowel which is assumed to follow them if they are not marked for any other vowel, and they may be marked with a special symbol (known as a ''virama'', from Sanskrit) or otherwise modified to suppress the inherent vowel. For example, in the Devanagari script, a script used to write a number of Indic languages including Hindi and Marathi, any consonantal grapheme in isolation is presumed to be followed by the vowel /a/. If any consonant is followed by another consonant without an intervening vowel, the cluster is written as a ''ligature'' (a glyph composed of multiple graphemes combined together).

== Syllabaries ==
[[Image:Cwy no parking.jpg|thumb|alt=No Parking traffic sign in Cherokee syllabary and English.|Syllabaries assign glyphs to syllables.]]
A ''syllabary'' assigns each syllable to one grapheme. Languages that use syllabic writing include Japanese (in one script), Cherokee, and Yi. Languages with syllabaries tend to have simpler phonotactics, since more possible syllables translates to a larger inventory of graphemes.

Syllabaries are distinct from abugidas in that similar syllables (e.g. ''ga'' and ''gi'') are not necessarily related to each other systematically.

== Logographies ==
[[Image:Pendant EN Louvre AO7702.jpg|thumb|alt=Pendant bearing the Sumerian logogram EN, meaning &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;|Logographies use glyphs to represent morphemes.]]

A ''logography'' (or ''logographic script'') is a writing system in which graphemes generally represent words or morphemes rather than sounds. Individual characters in a logographic script are known as ''logograms''.

Logographic scripts are not necessarily ideographic or pictographic. For instance, Chinese characters are not always ideographic since they may sometimes be used purely for phonetic content, and are usually have opaque derivation rather than being transparently pictographic.

The term ''hieroglyphs'' or ''hieroglyphics'' may be used to refer to logograms, but it is more often used to refer specifically to Ancient Egyptian.

Isolated logograms may be used in non-logographic scripts. For instance, the numerals and mathematical symbols used in English writing are logograms—1 one, 2 two, + plus, = equals, and so on. In English, the ampersand &amp; is used for and and et (such as &amp;c for et cetera), % for percent, $ for dollar, # for number, € for euro, £ for pound, etc. Note that logograms such as ''1'' are rarely used for phonetic value &amp;ndash; one would not write something like &quot;The team 1 the soccer game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions to this can be seen in forms of SMS and IM shorthand, but practical limitations on character counts or manual exertion create extra-linguistic motivating factors.&lt;/ref&gt; Also note that ''1'' may have different phonetic value depending on context: c.f. ''1'' &quot;one&quot; and ''1st'' &quot;first&quot;.

== Mixed scripts ==

Some languages use multiple types of script in writing. Such a form of writing may be known as a ''mixed script''. Examples of mixed scripts include Egyptian Hieroglyphs and Japanese writing.

== Unwritten language and new orthographies ==

In the past many non-native linguists created defective orthographies for previously unwritten languages, failing to mark important features such as tone and vowel length which they could not distinguish themselves, and sometimes marking unimportant allophonic detail.

Many contemporary new orthographies are modeled after the IPA. For instance, many languages in parts of Africa have the 7-vowel system /a ɛ e i ɔ o u/, and their recently-introduced orthographies commonly make use of the graphemes &amp;lt;ɛ, ɔ&amp;gt;.

=== Exercise 1: Nēhinawēwin ===

Swampy Cree (''Nēhinawēwin'') is a dialect of Cree, an Algonquian language spoken in Manitoba and Ontario. It is one of a number of Canadian languages which uses a writing system which is a type of the collection of related orthographies known as ''Canadian Aboriginal syllabics'' (or just ''syllabics''). The following is an Swampy Cree inscription from Winnipeg, written in syllabics. Using the transcription of the text in the Latin alphabet, given below, determine what rules govern characters in Cree syllabics, and what type of script you think it should be considered as.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Synopsis==
&lt;pre&gt;
\expandafter &lt;macro&gt; &lt;tokens&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Description==
The \expandafter command delays expanding a macro until its arguments have been expanded.

==Examples==
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\def\a[#1]{A's argument was `#1'}
\def\args{[FOO]}
\a\args
&lt;/source&gt;
will not work, saying &quot;! Use of &lt;code&gt;\a&lt;/code&gt; doesn't match its definition.&quot; This is because while defining &lt;code&gt;\a&lt;/code&gt;, the first argument (denoted &lt;code&gt;#1&lt;/code&gt;) appeared in square braces. Therefore, &lt;code&gt;\a&lt;/code&gt; expects its first argument to appear in square braces, while in &lt;code&gt;\a\args&lt;/code&gt;, the immediate character after &lt;code&gt;\a&lt;/code&gt; is not a left square bracket.
Using \expandafter, we can write
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\expandafter\a\args
&lt;/source&gt;
This expands &lt;code&gt;\args&lt;/code&gt; before &lt;code&gt;\a&lt;/code&gt;, as if we had written the following in the first place:
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;
\a[FOO]
&lt;/source&gt;
As a result, TeX will print &lt;code&gt;A's argument was `FOO'&lt;/code&gt;.

The \expandafter command first expands the tokens following &lt;macro&gt;, and then expands &lt;macro&gt;, with the expanded &lt;tokens&gt; following it as if they had been typed in the file.

==Multiple invocations==

One sometimes sees long chains of expandafters, which can normally be read as &quot;expand after N&quot;, e.g.
&lt;source lang=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;% Chain of expandafters leads to \pra having definition ``\onelevelexpanded''
\def\onelevelexpanded{Page={\the\count0} }
\def\mycommandcontents{\onelevelexpanded}
\ea\def\ea\pra\ea{\mycommandcontents}
&lt;/source&gt;
This expands &lt;code&gt;\mycommandcontents&lt;/code&gt; only once (in contrast to [[TeX/edef]]).

'''Canning''' is the preservation of food in airtight cans, generally under pressure and/or heat.  It is used to preserve [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]], [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], and [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]].  Canning prevents spoilage by halting microbial growth, eliminating oxygen (and related oxidation), and destroying enzymes.  Proper canning procedures allow foods to be stored for long periods without refrigeration.  However, canning is not perfect and some spoilage can occur, requiring care and attention.  Clostridium botulinum (which causes botulism) is one organism which can survive the canning process upon occasion.

Two main types of home canning are commonly used today: hot water baths and pressure canners.  Pressure canners must be used for low-acid foods (such as [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], and some [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]]) while hot water baths can be used for acidic foods only.  Foods can be naturally acidic, such as [[Cookbook:Recipe|applesauce]], or have added acids, like [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]].  Pint or quart glass jars are generally used with single use self-sealing lids.

In a hot water bath, filled jars are immersed in a canner full of hot water.  The canner is brought to a boil, and the jars are boiled for the given period of time.  During the process time, the vapors and expansion of the jar contents force the air out of the jars, creating a vacuum.

A similar process occurs in a pressure canner, except the increased pressure within the canner allows processing to occur at a higher temperature.  The higher temperatures are more effective at killing microorganisms, allowing low acid foods to be preserved.

Cleanliness is a key component of successful canning. Using sterilized jars, well washed and trimmed produce, and clean equipment prevents introducing microbial contamination and unwanted detrius.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some people view checksums as a kind of [[Algorithm Implementation/Hashing | hashing]] but take note that most will have no guarantee not to generate collisions (different inputs, same result).

A programmer writing a checksum algorithm should use
one's complement addition if one is willing to sacrifice error detection effectiveness for speed,
Fletcher-32 checksum for a balance of speed and error detection,
CRC-32 for better error detection.&lt;ref&gt;
Theresa C. Maxino.
[http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/thesis/maxino_ms.pdf &quot;The Effectiveness of Checksums for Embedded Networks&quot;]
compares the error detection effectiveness of commonly used checksums:
exclusive or (XOR), two's complement addition, ones' complement addition, Fletcher checksum, Adler checksum, and cyclic redundancy codes (CRC) ...
briefly mentions that &quot;weighted sum codes&quot; might be just as good as CRC in error detection but with lower computational cost ...
discusses common misconceptions about error check codes.
&lt;/ref&gt;
A programmer should use a MAC or digital signature -- typically involving a cryptographically secure hash such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 -- if one is willing to run a little slower in order to detect malicious alterations to data.
Such hashes are covered in a later chapter, [[../Hashing/]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Duxelles''' is a French mushroom dish.

==Directions==
For basic duxelles, mince 1/2 pound fresh mushrooms (or mushroom stems) and 1 small onion or 1 to 2 shallots. In a frying pan, sauté the onion or shallot in 1 to 2 tablespoons butter until soft but not brown (3 to 5 minutes). Stir in minced mushrooms, salt and pepper, chopped parsley to taste, and a pinch of tarragon or thyme if you wish. Depending on your main course, any fresh herb(s) or splash of soy sauce, white wine, Madeira, lemon juice, or even fruit, such as dried apricots, can be added. Cook the mixture over medium high heat until the mushrooms give off a lot of liquid; that liquid will evaporate completely (5 to 10 minutes). The duxelles will look like a coarse mash. Cool the mixture slightly and taste for seasoning. This will make about 1-1/2 cups. Duxelles may be frozen for 1 to 2 months. 

If you're using dried mushrooms, rinse them first as they are almost always holding grit and bits of the forest from which they grew; then soak them in very hot (but not boiling) water (add heated wine or fruit/vegetable juice if you want more flavor) until tender (10 to 20 minutes, depending on how large they are). Remove them from the water; rinse and again scrub them well with a mushroom brush. Pat the mushrooms dry and continue as for fresh mushrooms. 

Sauce duxelles is made starting off with a basic duxelles recipe, and then adding white wine, stock and tomato purée. This is served over fish, meat or eggs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Description==
===Visual effect===
* changes the color of the next objects to be drawn
[[image:OpenGL_Programming_reference_glColor.png]]
==Usage Context==
* Will work anywhere in Display loop but normally used between [[OpenGL_Programming/reference/glBegin|glBegin]] and [[OpenGL_Programming/reference/glEnd|glEnd]].
* Affects everything following until it is called again or the loop starts over.
* [[OpenGL_Programming/reference/glEnd|glEnd]](); and [[OpenGL_Programming/reference/glBegin|glBegin]](); do not affect it.

==Usage Examples==
* draws 7 points and 3 different colors
* starting from x center  y .5+  and moving to  x .6+ y .5+
* shows that the color will stay even if you restart a new gl section
* shows that the color will stay even if the loop starts over
* replace the display function with this in the [[OpenGL_Programming/reference/basic_testing_app|basic testing app]] program to see the results

Savanna Redding was 13 years old and an 8th-grade honors' student in Arizona in 2003 when she was strip-searched by school officials after a classmate had reported that she had prescription-strength Ibuprofen.

Read about the story in the link below:
[http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/04/19/scotus.strip.search/index.html]
[http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle_blog/2009/jun/25/supreme_court_upholds_fourth_ame]

In April 2009, her case was heard by the US Supreme Court. They voted 8-1 to uphold the students' rights and declared the search unreasonable under the 4th Amendment[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution]].

Do you support this decision? Some agree with the court that school officials went too far and that the search was too invasive for the suspected offense. Others argue that this decision gives students a free license to hide drugs in their underwear (since school official will now have to think twice about searching students). Where do you stand as far as this issue is concerned?

&lt;/span&gt;

== Hands off! ==

The 4TH Amendment to the Constitution says: '''The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.''' I think a strip search for prescription ibuprofin is unreasonable and my only problem with this is that it took so many years for this girl to find justice. I know drugs are a problem in schools but strip searching anyone goes too far, this was a school not prison. I do agree with locker searches because they belong to the school but the girls body belongs to her and they would need a search warrant and probable cause to search her.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 04:58, 10 August 2009 (UTC)




I would absolutely say that schoool officials should not have stipped search this girl.  It was uncalled for and there was no evidence that this girl had done anything wrong or had been carrying anything having to do with drugs.  I do not believe any child should ever have to experience a strip search.[[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 00:49, 10 August 2009 (UTC)  
 
I think that this case is crazy! I certainly understand the importance and need to keep drugs out of schools; however, I think it is also very important to trust children until they have given you a reason not to. If the child had been notorious for bringing dangerous or illegal things to school, then why not take a step further and search her for drugs/weapons. But based on something that another student said (which could very well be made up) it is critical that you give the other child a chance to explain. This teaches the children about trust, consequences, etc. I absolutely think that jumping right to a strip search should be out of the question! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 23:28, 9 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002

This was ridiculous! Especially since this girl had no prior issues in school, was on the honor roll, and there was no real basis for the search. Besides, why would she have pills down her underwear? If there were no signs of the pills on her or in her backpack, that should have been sufficient enough. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 23:18, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I'm very surprised that the administrators were willing to take this leap.  To me it doesn't seem like the reaction fit the accusation.  An administrator must have their endorsement which means they have to have had a school law course on the graduate level.  I'm sure at some point there was mention of unreasonable searches.  Maybe they were absent during that class.  A good rule of thumb that I have used with students and teacher alike is &quot;If in doubt, dont... or ask&quot;.  I find it hard to believe there wasn't at least a small amount of doubt in the administrators mind before administering the strip search. [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 16:30, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I was very upset after reading this article.  I would be appalded if I were that student or parent.  I can not believe she was stripped searched over Ibprofen.  I do not think children should be strip searched at all let alone in the school system.  There are so many other ways to deal with a child that may be carrying something in school that is not allowed.  After reading the article I began wondering how the girl in the article was feeling when this happened and following the incedent dealing with the courts and the media.  This situation could have been avoided. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 14:26, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

This was definitely unreasonable.  A 13-yr old for Ibuprofen?  Come on, really?  I wonder what effect this incident had on her.  I do not believe that anyone should be strip-searched at school, especially for meds you can get at wal-wart?!  I believe that strip-searches should only be used in extreme cases.  What if someone is suspected of carrying a gun or other weapons?  Or, if a student has been caught multiple times already.  This is a fine line because we all want schools to be safe.  And as parents of school age children, I hate to think about any of these things being in front of my kids.  But in reality, there is no stopping some of these things.
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 01:23, 8 August 2009 (UTC)


Wow.  How is that girl ever going to be able to deal with the fact that she was strip searched at the young age of 13, for over-the-counter medications!  That is madness.  I agree with some of the people below that there isn't much you can do to prevent drug abuse.  Even if there was a magic way to check people at school, there is nothing you can do about a student that takes drugs (prescription or not!) and comes to school under the influence.  That's one of those things that you're not going to be able to do anything about.  That's a pretty sad excuse to strip-search anyone!  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 00:10, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I feel like no matter what schools do to try and prevent drug use at their school, it is still going to happen. No matter what kind of regulations are put in place, students will always find some way to get around them. I think that strip searches are terrible and should only be used as an absolute last resort (i.e. the student has been caught with drugs multiple times). I think that schools should have a no-tolerance drug policy and should make it clear what punishments will await a student who breaks these rules. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 17:33, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

That is ridiculous. Did they consider that because of her age is was appropriate to strip search her or something? What in the hell is wrong with people? This is the sort of thing that makes me laugh at how abusive people get over their authority. There was nothing logical at all about strip searching that girl, and everyone involved should be utterly ashamed. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 22:10, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

Zero-tolerance policy or not unless somebody’s life is in danger there is never a good reason to strip search a child. This comes close to being sexual abuse, my goodness she is only a 13 year old child. Students look up to those with authority at school. I could only imagine all those students and parents who were affected by this incident.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 00:52, 9 August 2009 (UTC)


I agree with the post above. There is nothing more we can do to prevent drug abuse. We can talk and tell students the effects of drugs until we are blue in the face but they are either going to listen or not. I know that strip searches happen and that is great if it is done the correct way (if there is such a thing). In the case of the young girl and the ibuprofen I'm not sure what is exactly right or wrong. Drug searches need to happen but not in the manner that was conducted in the article. I do believe that searches can stereotype certain students who aren't drug users/abusers. This could ruin them in the social scene and in the classroom. So I vote to keep the hands off as well. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 17:44, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

This is an easy issue to report on.  I am familiar with that case and would not expect the outcome to be any different.  Why would anyone think it is all right to strip search a 13 year-old girl for ibuprofen?  That almost makes me sick.  Furthermore, there was no reasonable suspicion.  It was the word of another student.  Seriously?  I can say no more.  I pray for that little girl and hope she is able to move past the embarrassment and humiliation of such a despicable act.  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 18:06, 6 August 2009 (UTC)


I can't imagine how humiliating it was for the girl who was subjected to this horrible act.  I do not condone strip searching ofr school children, especially over an allegation by another student and the subatance involved.  A child wants to feel safe and protected while they are in school.  As educators, we struggle daily with strengthening student self worth as well as self esteem.  School are concerned with illegal substances on campuses and drug abuse in general.  However, strip searches violate the rights of the students and, in my opinion, scar a student for live.  In this case, over an Advil! There are far less trumatizing ways to punish a student who breaks a school rule.  I agree with the Surpreme Court...leave the students alone!   [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 18:24, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

I feel that no matter what the situation, students should not be strip-searched. I feel that this is an invasion of privacy on the student and should never be used. Teachers and administrators can tell students not to bring drugs and prescriptions to school until they are blue in the face, however, students will always find a way around it. In the case of the young girl and the Ibufrofin, I do not agree with strip-searching. I also think that strip-searching can stereotype certain students who do not use drugs. Most of the time administrators and teachers are actiing upon unreasonable suspicions, anyway. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 11:58, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

I find this completely invasive and a violation of one self. I can't imagine this happening to me in middle school in front of everyone, I would be so ashamed. As a future teacher I would hate to see this happen in public to a students. They completely approached it the wrong way. They should have taken the student to the principles office and spoken to her and confirmed that the medication was given with a prescription verifying with the parents and the doctor if it was needed. Strip searching is sending such a negative message to our students, it is giving them more reasons to hide things and it is making it harder for teachers to get close to them and open up about things. It is the same as if your boss gave you a negative evaluation in front of the entire office, it's just unethical. We as adults need to teach children how to be respectfull of others, how are we suppose to teach this when children have no trust and respect from us. My elders have always told me that respect and trust needs to be earned, but if it has not been broken why mistrust.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 16:57, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

This was a shameful, horrifying invasion of a young girl's privacy.  There is never cause to do this and the Supreme Court made a wise judgement.  If there was a seriously suspected drug problem at a school, couldn't a drug sniffing dog find drugs without violating a student's personal privacy?  It makes me angry beyond words.  [[Special:Contributions/97.80.242.214|97.80.242.214]] ([[User talk:97.80.242.214|talk]]) 00:02, 8 August 2009 (UTC) [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 23:08, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

I remember seeing this story on the news a few weeks ago and when it first came to light. My initial, and present, thoughts were how ridiculous the school officials acted. The student was clearly a model student, since she was an honors’ student and she was 13 at the time of the strip-search, a time where many girls her age begin taking prescription-strength Ibuprofen. Another thing that disturbed me was that the Redding was reported by another student. While it is important for student to report cases of drug use on school property, how did the school official know if it was not a personal, indirect attack? It might not have been, however, considering the situation it seems very likely. In the case of Savanna Redding, I do support the decision of the Supreme Court and agree that the school officials were too invasive, especially considering the fact it was a 13 years old girl with prescription-strength Ibuprofen. I also understand the opposition because the decision may seem that students will now have an effortless time bringing drugs on school property. Currently, the only solution I see for the moment is to have effective drug prevention programs within a community. I strongly stress community, because in many cases, drug programs only have a police officer come in once a year to discuss drugs and alcohol. In order to be effective, teachers are going to have be better informed themselves about drugs and parents are going to have to start participating as well. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 01:29, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

Oh my gosh, how dare they! I cannot believe that the school thought this was appropriate action to take. This is supposed to be a school in United States, not a prison in a third world country. I understand the zero tolerance to drugs...but come on, this was extreme measures and the school should have to pay for their infraction. Not only did they violate the teenager (young teenager at that), she will probably have serious emotional issues for a while. It is one thing to search a child's locker and backpack...but this could be classified as emotional and physical rape without penetration. How will this child feel safe in the school again? The Supreme Court found in favor of the student which should be applauded. When it comes to drugs, even over-the-counter medication such as Ibuprophen, Tylenol, Benedryl, etc. cannot be brought to school without a note signed by a physician and taken to the nurse for despensing. This is because kids are very creative when it comes to drugs and should not be allowed to take them by themselves in school. When I worked at a high school, one of the students had taken his ADHD medicine, crushed it up, mixed it with over-the-counter medicine, and sold it to a lot of students to snort, until the school police officer caught him.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 04:16, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

Wow I feel like this was definitely unreasonable! No one should have their privacy violated like that, especially a thirteen year old girl who is in honors classes! Usually those in honors classes don't get into delinquent behavior as often. And come on, it was Ibuprofen not anything illegal,they didn't have to go as far as they did for that kind of search. I definitely agree with the court and feel that her rights were violated. I cannot believe that some people believe that is okay for the school to search students like that. And in the first place, they should have asked her if she had a reason for having that kind of medication. She may have had a note from her doctor allowing her to have the medication for any conditions she may have. The school definitely did not take the appropriate action in that situation, I hope that they have not taken similar actions since then. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 13:05, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I think that this type of search was uncalled for. Though I understand the concern about students bringing in any type of drug into schools, this is a 13 year old girl accused (technically word of mouth) by a peer. This matter should have been handled in a more private and less chaotic manner. If parental and doctors notes are provided there's no need to go to such extremes for ibuprofen. The girl may have had the medical need for it. Definitely uncalled for! [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 18:47, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I have been following this case for a while now.  I can not believe that they did that.  While I am in support of the investigation of illegal drugs, there is a limit to what can be done!  I have an almost 13 year old daughter, how horrible it must have been for this girl in school to be embarrassed like this!  I think that the court made the right decision and there are far too many other druge filtering through schools to be worrying about a girl who had or did not have ibuprofen.  Get real...she is after all still a kid and no one should be treating a kid like that without her parents involved.  Also, if they would have called the police do you really think that they would have searched this girl for that???  The school would have been laughed at and told no way.
[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 19:13, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I am still in disbelief at the actions of these school officials, the strip search was completely uncalled for.  This girl was exposed, vulnerable, and ultimately mishandled.  This situation has forced us to revaluate how these things are handled in the future. The parents should first be contacted and asked if their child is permitted to have the medication, and the police should be called in regards to illegal drugs.  Though it was unfortunate what this adolescent had to go through, her incidence drew the parameters for future events. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 15:36, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

The search was, in my opinion, totally uncalled for.  Ibuprofen is not a controlled substance, sure the article mentions it was “prescription strength” but that just means the pills were larger. Taking several over the counter pills would have the same effect. Strip searching anyone for medication that is basically over the counter is absurd and calls into question the validity of “zero” tolerance programs all together. (If anyone saw the Colbert report last week and saw the story on the young lady who was expelled for taking a birth control pill during lunch that is another prime example of the Kafka-esque scenarios that ensue from “zero-tolerance”)  I mean, sure strip search students if they’re suspected of selling potentially harmful controlled substances but cases like this just take the “war on drugs” into the realm of absurdity. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 18:16, 9 August 2009 (UTC)


Strip searching a 13 year old honors student is unnecessary. In some cases, maybe stripe searches are necessary, but in this situation it was very uncalled for. A middle school student's ibuprofen does not merit the stripe search of this poor young girl. Not only did this go beyond the means for this particular situation, but it also tainted the innocence of this child. The war on drugs is a serious cause, but ibuprofen does not merit such extremes.[[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:49, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

I agree with everyone else. It was absoulutely uncalled for. The school officials should be embarrassed at their lack of judgement. Yes, drugs in schools may merit a strip search, but not ibuprofen. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]])


This is a difficult situation to be in. I understand the fact that the school wanted to make sure that she wasn't hiding them anywhere else, but to strip search an eighth grader is a little crazy. A regular search would have sufficed. I'm sure if the school administration had asked her for them that she probably would have given them to her. I understand the need to keep the drugs out of school but that is crissung the line a little bit. [[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 04:42, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

== Search Away. Anything to keep the drugs at Bay. ==
Search her!!  I am definitely in favor of searching students if they are suspected to have drugs.  However, if they need to do a strip search, I think that they should have appropriate personnel, namely a female police officer take care of it.  Students need to know that they cannot get away with hiding drugs or any kind of dangerous item in their clothing while they are at school.  Students have rights and so a student should not have to be asked to be stripped searched at the drop of a penny.  Rather there needs to be some kind of standard for deciding when it is appropriate for a strip search to take place.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:CellPhone.png|300px]]&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;
Many college students bring their cell phones and laptops to class. Some of these students use these technological tools to engage in non-school related personal activities (such as texting friends or chatting on Facebook) during class time. In fact, in Spring 2009 an ECI 301 student told the professor she couldn't participate in a class role-playing activity because she was engaged in an argument with her boyfriend on Facebook.

Many high schools and junior high schools have strict policies outlawing cell phones and prohibiting students from using computers for personal activities during school hours. Should college classrooms enact such regulations? Or should college students be able to make their own decisions about how to use their technology during class?

== We're all adults here. College students should decide for themselves how and when they want to use their phones and laptops and the extent to which they will participate in class activities. ==

I often see students in class wit their laptops surfing the web or chatting but I also see many students taking notes. I find that most teachers will say something if they see a student checking their email during class and I find that most students will switch pages as the teacher walks by showing that they know its wrong. We are adults paying for college with our own money (some of us),if students want to take a moment to &quot;phase out&quot; during a 3 hour class let them. I cannot imagine anyone spending the entire class not paying attention, they would fail.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 04:44, 10 August 2009 (UTC)


I am sort of on the border about this topice.  I do feelt hat college students should have the right to use their technology as they please. I say this by means of that these devices or whatever they are doing does not affect the learning of other students.  Honestly, I can ot imagine that everyone pays 100 percent attention 100 percent of the time and I feel they have a right to do what they please for a few moments to get back on track.  We all need those moments of escape or day dream. I think high school is a tougher choice just because of maturity and not always being considerate of peers. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 00:56, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

College students should be responsible for themselves and what they do on their computers and/or cell phones. As long as they are not being disruptive to the classroom or disrespectful to the teachers. I have been in classes where while the professor is lecturing students have answered their phones in class. This is rude and disruptive and should not be tolerated. But, as long as the students aren't being disrespectful, what they get out of class is up to them. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 23:27, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I do feel students should be allowed to bring their technologies to class. I also feel though that students should be respectful of the teachers and turn their phones to vibrate while in the class. As for the facebook and myspace issues during class I do feel that students can use those technologies in the classroom but I feel I would not do that.  i feel I am paying a lot of money to attend college and I feel I want to get my moneys worth. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 14:48, 9 August 2009 (UTC) 

College students should be allowed to have more freedom than high school students.  In college courses the expectations are set from the beginning of class about participation.  If the professor requires the student to participate in class in order to receive part of their grade then they need to realize that.  If they choose to not participate then they should know they are forfeiting their grade.  If the professor just require attendance and no participation, then the student should be able to use the time in class to fit their needs.  It is up to the student to acquire the knowledge that the professor shares.  After that the student's education is in their hand. [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 16:37, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

When you are a college student you should have enough sense to make your own decisions.  But I do believe if something a student is doing on their cell phone or laptop is disrupting other students or the class that the professor has rights to take action.  The real issue is if it is hindering other students from concentrating or learning.  If you are minding your own business but not paying attention in class that is your fault and you will have to catch up on your own time.  Even if these things were not allowed in class, students would have other ways not to pay attention or participate.  I know there are many students who do not have these things but still will not participate.  So I think students should be able to decide for themselves.
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 02:11, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

College students should be capable of making their own decisions. We are adults. That said, a professor should be totally within their rights to simply walk over to someone using their laptops for facebooking or anything other than class-related use and ask politely for them to leave.[[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 22:14, 7 August 2009 (UTC) 

I totally agree with this statement. Even if cell phones are not allowed, we as college students will still find a way to use them during class. Also, colleges can not ban the use of laptops because many students use them for note-taking and not just Facebooking. I feel that if students decide to bring their laptop to class but use it for Facebook instead of taking notes, then that is their choice and their fault. It's the same as not coming to class- it's a choice that the student has made. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 17:42, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

By the time a student is in college they should know how to respect others in a class. As long as someone cell phone or computer are not disrupting anyone in the class, these items should be in the class it is their paid education they are jeopardizing not mine.[[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 01:11, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I don't think that college students need to be restricted on wether they can bring their phone or computer to class. College students should be treated as adults, and when adults get treated like children they act the same. Restricting college students would send out a message that they are not able to behave in an adult setting. Allthought I do not think that college students should be restructed, I do feel that it is very disrespectfull for a student to be doing unrelated school activities during a class, it is distracting as well. If a students is really not in the class to pay attention and try lo learn from the professor than they should not come at all. On another note I think that teachers who have rules about mandatory attendance to class to be able to pass the class is unnecessary. I think that as long as the students completes the work on time and passes the test that they should be able to pass the class and that attendance should have nothing to do with passing the class. We are all suppose to be aduls right? Let us be responsible for our own actions.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 17:06, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

It would be so ridiculous to enact those same rules at a college level.  Even at a high school and middle school level, it is still a little ridiculous.  We cannot fight the trends of technology.  We should simply embrace them and find ways to integrate those things into our curriculum.  We should integrate them during school years.  In college, students should be able to choose how to effectively time manage.  I like teletechnet classes because I can come listen to the lectures and also do homework for my other classes.  Having my laptop and being in class is an effective way for me to multitask and make the most of every minute of my time.  It should be my choice as how to spend my time.  I pay to be lectured to.  [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 17:18, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

I would have to agree that we are all adults, and college students should be able to decide for themselves how and when they want to use their phones and laptops and the extent to which they will participate in class activities. I have always been a good student, but I will admit that I do log onto the Wireless Internet during some college courses to check my e-mail or Face book. It helps to pass the time, especially when you feel that a 3 hour class could be accomplished in an hour. Some classes, however, do not allow you to search the web and require 100% attention. If you decide not to give the professor this attention, your must pay the consequences. College students should be treated like adults in every manner, and they should be responsible for their own actions. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 22:08, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

College students should be allowed to use whatever they want in class '''as long as it disturbs no one else.'''  They fact that they are adults responsible for their own actions and are paying to attend gives them this right.  They do not have the right to interfere with anyone else's learning.

I feel that when you are in college, you should be responsible enough to make your own decisions in class. Regardless of whether you choose to pay attention to the material or not, you are paying for the class so what you want to do in that time is your responsibility. I am not saying you should be texting or on Facebook the whole class period, but if that is what you decide to do with your time instead of paying attention to the material, then that is no one else's concern but your own. I do not believe that schools should enact policies against having technology in the classroom. Sometimes cell phones are good when people need to get in contact with you and cant call you. Texting is less of a distraction than calling someone during class, and you can often just send a quick text to ensure plans without losing sight of the material. I feel that college students are all adults and should be able to make their own decisions regarding technology use in the classroom. [[User:Rburt005|Rburt005]] ([[User talk:Rburt005|talk]]) 13:10, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

A very controversial and important issue because we have seen recently that technology has shown improvement, and deterioration, among students. If college classrooms place such restrictions during school hours, students may be less incline to attend courses and/or schools. On the other hand, it may strengthen the work ethic of students who follow these restrictions because it shows the professors and college that these are truly dedicated students. There can also be two sides to college students making their own decisions. By the time a student is in college, they should have the common sense to pay attention during class, and if not, deal with the consequences. However, I know that occasionally there are students, especially with children at home, who like having a form of silent communication in the classroom since cell phones are very disruptive. With the very small exception of freshmen and sophomores that recently graduated from high school, it is my opinion that it is the students’ choice to use technology for personal activities during course sessions. By the time you are taking college courses, you should be mature enough to make responsible decisions such as paying attention in class. And if not, blaming only yourself for a bad grade. In the cases such as the ECI 301 student who was too busy arguing with her boyfriend of Facebook to participate in an activity, I think they deserve an F or some type of grade deduction. Depending on the teacher, they may even be asked to leave since they are too busy doing something personal on the teacher’s time. I understand emergencies, where students have to leave during class, however, it seems that this scenario could have waited until after class. And if it was truly important to the student, she should have left the classroom. The classroom is a place for learning, and if you are not available to do that, then you should not be there.  [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 17:18, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I think that college students are old enough to know what is right from wrong and engaging in their own decisions. I feel that we are also old enough to deal with the consequences of such actions. We all know that if we engage in Facebook chats while in class we wont learn anything, therefore, the time and effort we have spent is for nothing. I don't agree with using these technology gadgets as &quot;time-killers&quot; for class time. Everything has a place and time. Laptops should be used to review school material only while in class. While cellphones should be stored and silenced. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 18:51, 8 August 2009 (UTC)


While I must agree that there should be a limit to what students do in class, we are all adults and the truth is we paid for the classes we take and if it is not impeding the other classmates from learning I say go for it.  Now do I think it is rude for the teacher to be lecturing and someone ignoring questions or directions, yes!  But, like I said that is a maturity thing and anyone of us could place ourselves in the shoes of the teacher and see how we would feel.  Probably not too happy with the student, I think.  So common courtesy is the key and if you woud rather fight with your boyfriend then get a good grade then it was your money and it was your grade.

I think it would be ridiculous to ban these things from college classrooms, we should all be responsible enough to know what's acceptable and what's not in the classroom.  I'm aware of those that rudely partake in online activities during class, however, those students should be penalized individually instead of penalizing the whole class. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 15:19, 9 August 2009 (UTC)


The obvious difference between college students and high school students is that college student pay to be there, and high schoolers legally have to be there. High school students are mandated by the state to attend and meet certain standards. Their attendance is monitored as well as their in class activities. College goers on the other hand are legally adults and pay to attend class. No one checks behind them to see that they are attending class, so why would it seem necessary to limit what they can or cannot do in class to the extent to which it does not interrupt anyone else's learning.[[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 02:06, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

College students pay tuition and should not be held under the same rules as high schools. However, that being said, teachers and professors could use laptops and cell phones as well as other technology and incorporate them into the lecture. Students may be less likely to use them for personal uses. There is a line that can be crossed. It is a different story if you are disturbing others. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 02:33, 10 August 2009 (UTC)


I agree with the statement we are adults, if that's how we want to spend our class time then we are only hurting ourselves. In college we have to pay for out education unlike in high school. This is one of the main reasons why the colleges shouldn't waist their time trying too enforce those rules, because it won't really do them any good. For instance, look at the high schools and junior high schools that do enforce the no computers no cell phone rules. The students have figured out ways to hide the fact that they are using their phones. They text from in their desk or inside their purses. I think that if you want to spend a thousand dollars on a class a choose to spend that time on Facebook that should be your mistake, I mean decision.

== Courtesy please. I don't want to be distracted by a classmate on Facebook. If students are not here to learn; they shouldn't bother coming. ==

I have to say that I wish most college students were responsible enough to make the decision on their own but unfortunately many are not. It is very frustrating to see people on the phone, searching the internet or playing games. It can be very distracting for other students in the class as well as for the professor. I think that for the sake of the rest of the class and as an act of respect for the teacher, using technological devices not pertaining to the class material should not be allowed. I think its great to incorporate computers into lessons and if students find them helpful then that's great, but keep to the class material and just take notes! Chances are, you'll be better off that way anyways! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 23:55, 9 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002


I'm surprised that not more postings are down here with the anti-technology vote.  To me, it is so aggravating to watch someone sit there and text friends all during class.  It's rude, to say the least.  If someone is on their phone or computer they ARE NOT listening to what is being discussed in class.  This is a sore subject with me because I think that people who are always texting are RUDE and it's disruptive to everyone around.  It's like going out to dinner with someone and while they are talking to you they are texting someone.  REALLY?  SO rude!  If people are permitted to text and look at their laptops during a lecture I should be able to knit.  At least I would be paying attention.  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 00:16, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I consider myself a technologically savvy individual and I own a cell phone and a laptop (along with lots of other goodies).  I don't have a problem with them being in a classroom; however, what students are doing with them can be distracting.  Ringers should be silenced as not to interrupt the teacher or students. (I fully understand the need to have communication in case of an emergency.) If you can't take your fingers off of the keypad long enough to suspend your texting, turn it off.  You may think it is not bothering anyone, but it is.  And yes, we know what you are doing with the phone under the desk.  I don't have a problem with laptops in the classroom.  It is your decision whether or not you choose to waste your time chatting on Facebook instead of concentrating on your class.  Personally, I think it is rude.  I know that these all are a sign of the times.  Please, if you can't tear yourself away from the cell or social networking, turn it off.  The last time I checked, there is not a degree being offered in texting.  [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 18:37, 6 August 2009 (UTC)


I think using a cell phone in class in very '''disrespectful''' to not only to the professor but to fellow classmates as well. If you are in college you need to act like a civilized adult and be respectful of others. Laptops are somewhat distractful when classmates are on sites that are not related to the class. I was in an ecology class one time where the guy in front of me constantly used his laptop. He never paid attention to the professor (who was an awesome teacher) and I would find my eyes wondering to his screen more than once during class. This really had an indirect effect on me and my grade in that class. I would try to go over my notes that night after lecture and couldn't remember anything that my teacher had said. I confided in my professor and we decided it would be best if I moved where I sit in class. It helped me but I don't think that I should've had to move. The guy was a genius and aced every test. Looking back on it now he was probably bored with the class and wanted something else to do. However, I still believe he should have shown courtesy for me and my other classmates. [[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 21:21, 6 August 2009 (UTC)


I think you should turn off your cell phone and limit your computer use to in-school studies ONLY! School is a place for learning. If you would rather talk on your phone or play computer games, than you should not come to class. It is the perogative of the professor to prohibit the use of cell phones and laptops during class. When I went to the orientation for a class, some of the students played games on the computers while the professor was discussing the syllabus of the impending class. I found it very distracting. The professor even stopped in the middle of his discussion to ask the students if they found the games more appealing than the discussion. The students thought it was funny and I felt sorry for the professor. As the beginning question noted, college students are presumed adults...so they need to act like it and show some respect to the professor who is trying to teach them something. As for the student in the ECI 301 spring class...the student should face some kind of reprimand, because that is just plain stupidity. Obviously, they are not mature enough to attend college. It's all about common courtesy and respect that we seem to be lacking these days! What happened to &quot;do unto others as you wish them to do unto you?&quot;[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 06:00, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

As far as face book is concerned I don’t really find it all that distracting if a classmate chooses to squander his time rather than listen to a lecture. (Often I am jealous that they have the option to do so as many lectures are somewhat less than stellar)  However, cell phones should be off during class time.  Perhaps I can deal with texting, if the student has their keypad silenced, but actually talking on the phone? That’s just absurd.  Of course this applies to the student on the laptop as well, although there are not many who’ve made it to college that are either A) rude enough, or B) stupid enough, to fart around on unsilenced laptops during class. Overall though I can see how professors would hate the disrespect implicit in the act of texting or abusing laptop privileges. I also, think it largely depends upon the grade level and class size. In an auditorium size college class obviously it would be much harder to enforce any kind of embargo on laptops or cell phones.  Where as in a high school class room, due to the proximity to other students and the teacher a cell phone or laptop abuser would be easier to spot, and probably be a larger distraction. [[User:BitterAsianMan|BitterAsianMan]] ([[User talk:BitterAsianMan|talk]]) 18:40, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

Courtesy please.  I believe that colleges should make requirements for students not to engage in off-task facebook or phone interactions during class.  The reason for this is simple.  Doing such off-task stuff such as facebook or phone texting distracts not only the one doing it but also others in the class.  It's the class at large that is at stake.  Therefore, the issue is more than simply about the freedom of one student.  Thus, the rule should be enforced.  In reference to the problem mentioned above, if the girl is immature to argue over facebook during class, I think the boyfriend was right in dumping her.

Let's say &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; is revamped by the new Obama administration and school districts now have to decide for themselves on how they will demonstrate that students are performing on grade level. 

You are working at a school and the principal calls a meeting. He wants you, the teachers, to propose a new strategy for showing student mastery of the state standards.

What do you propose? (Add a new headline if you'd like.) Try to win your classmates over to your way of thinking.

== Let's just stick with the SOL tests. ==

I think SOL's are borderline.  I think it is great that there is a standard set that is a line to see whether school's are doing what they need to do.  It is holding school systems responsible.  Saying that I do feel that there has to be a better way of assessing students then a standardized test.  If SOL's are done away with then I do feel there needs to be standards set by the state to continually show progression and student achievement. [[User:Sston008|Sston008]] ([[User talk:Sston008|talk]]) 00:59, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

I think for the time being SOLs are the way to go.  I also think that teacher made tests should be incorporated as well.  SOLs were constructed for students to be at certain standards and I think at this time they are the best way to go.  It allows students to be learning and tested on the same thinkgs which is good especially for military families and those that move a lot.  The SOLs area good way to teach students at the same pace. [[User:Lwill031|Lwill031]] ([[User talk:Lwill031|talk]]) 15:05, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I believe keeping the SOLs is the best idea for now.  I believe there needs to be some kind of standards for teachers.  This allows all students to be taught in the same way.  What is wrong with reaching goals and striving to do your best?  I know it seems to add so much stress for kids and teachers worrying about passing the SOLs, but there definitely needs to be standards that educators need to meet.  We do want all students to have the same opportunities and be exposed to the same knowledge skills.
[[User:Aferg006|Aferg006]] ([[User talk:Aferg006|talk]]) 02:58, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

Maybe the reason that some teachers dislike SOL tests is because it forces them to step up their games and have lesson plans that conform to a set of standards.  The SOL's ensure that teachers teach relevant information that students need, and I think that it's a good plan.  I like that it forces students and teachers to try harder and reach goals.  The SOL's aren't a perfect solution, but there is nothing wrong with teaching a set curriculum, and the students being responsible to reach those goals.  [[User:Ldomm002|Ldomm002]] ([[User talk:Ldomm002|talk]]) 00:25, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

Although I may not like all points of the SOL tests, I think that we are probably better off if we keep the SOL tests. These tests allow the students to be tested on the lessons they have been taught, and it provides a central test for teachers to use. Also, they provide certain points of focus for the lessons the teachers must teach. I do not like how teachers feel that they cannot branch off of their lessons and teach anything unique, but I think that the benefits outweigh the costs. Schools have been using these tests for years now, and students are successfully graduating and receiving great jobs. This shows that they were obviously taught and tested on lessons that brought them great success. [[User:Afett001|Afett001]] ([[User talk:Afett001|talk]]) 22:16, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

I believe for right now even though most people do not agree with the SOL tests that keeping them is the best idea. I do not feel that having a teacher made test is subjective enough to be used to test students' abilities in the classroom. I believe that SOLs are good standards to test students against and should be kept in place at least for now. You can make additions to the SOL or edits, but I do believe that keeping the SOLs are the best testing method for now.

SOL type testing appears to be working when it comes to testing standards, why change what works. If a there are going to be standards that are being tested for, and it is going to be stae wide why change anything that for the most part is currently working. [[User:Mlipl001|Mlipl001]] ([[User talk:Mlipl001|talk]]) 02:01, 9 August 2009 (UTC)
 

I think SOL testing contains the information and the challenges that a student needs. I feel that if we stick by them for now, it will improve. At my high school we had a certain week in which we only focused on SOL testing procedures in each of our classes. I believe that this helped and it made each student feel ready to face them. [[User:Ehern004|Ehern004]] ([[User talk:Ehern004|talk]]) 18:54, 8 August 2009 (UTC)


I think the SOL's are currently the most successful form of testing to date, thus I think they should be kept.  If we allow teachers the freedom to  assess and test their students we could run into a variety of problems.  They provide a set of guidelines for educators to adhere to and follow throughout the year; ultimately ensuring consistency across the board.  If it were to change in the near future there would need to be a clear set of standards that teachers would continue to follow when creating their own tests.  It will be interesting to see what comes of the NCLB in the near future. [[User:Rpaige|Rpaige]] ([[User talk:Rpaige|talk]]) 15:06, 9 August 2009 (UTC)


The SOLs are not  a bad idea. I think that the multiple choice format of the test does limit to test understanding, and also makes it very easy to cheat on. Keeping a standardized test seems to be the best answer. However, i believe the tests should be short answer, where especially in math, the work is counted. I think another important alternative would be allowing teachers of kids who can't seem to pass to submit a portfolio for a student and take away some of the pressure on this high stakes tests. [[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 02:15, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

Sticking with SOL tests are the way to go.  Looking at how schools do on SOL tests is one way that a school can assess how well it is keeping up with standards of the state.  A &quot;new&quot; way of assessing a school or school districts progress may be to continue working on developing a type of benchmark system that gives the most helpful feedback in preparation for the SOL.  School systems with ineffective benchmarks waste a lot of time working on benchmark analysis that give no significant direction in helping these teachers prepare theirs students for the test that counts the most:  the SOL.  [[User:Mbrowder|Mbrowder]] ([[User talk:Mbrowder|talk]]) 01:07, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

== NO MORE PRESSURE!!==

The idea behind the SOL's was a good but it was taken too far. The teachers begin preparing for the SOL's within the first few weeks of school because the pressure to perform is great. The teachers are supposed to be teaching the state standards anyway so have the teachers in each grade compile questions for that grade that demonstrate state standards. If the teachers should have faith in themselves that they have done their job and their students know the information they need to. No more year long pressure that gets worse in the spring. The pressure is bad for the students and the general environment. Many students find it difficult to learn under pressure. The teachers are quickly going over information and maybe even skipping things that would excite learning because it's not on the SOL.[[User:Jnemo001|Jnemo001]] ([[User talk:Jnemo001|talk]]) 01:39, 10 August 2009 (UTC)


I think removing the SOL's would take a lot of stress off of the teacher and especially the student. Now a lot of teachers don't teach whats in the textbook just what is going to be on the SOL. I think that the SOL's had a good run. I think that instead of having the SOL's and letting the teacher's final exam (that they have to submit for approval any way) be the equivalent. If the student can't pass the class then most of the time they just think that the SOL's are a waste of time. The graduation rate of a school should be looked at more closely than the percentage of questions that you can answer on a test that you don't really care much about in the first place. [[User:Rcoll029|Rcoll029]] ([[User talk:Rcoll029|talk]]) 04:54, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

== Teacher-made tests! ==

It seems to me that if teachers are trusted the whole year round to deliver information, conduct testing and evaluate children, why should they not be allowed to do this at the end of the year? I am not sure that each individual teacher is qualified enough to create a test that will evaluate whether or not the children in the class are learning on grade level, but it seems to me that something drastic must be done to revamp the SOLs. I have heard too many complaints from teachers that teaching to the SOLs and giving the SOL tests at the conclusion of the year just isn't working. Too many children are not good &quot;test takers&quot; and this doesnt mean that they have not learned anything or that they are dumb, it simply means that they do not perform well on standardized tests! I don't have a specific solution but I think teacher made tests are a good idea and a valuable option for changing the current system! [[User:Khedl002|Khedl002]] ([[User talk:Khedl002|talk]]) 00:21, 10 August 2009 (UTC)khedl002

I think that teacher made tests would be an excellent idea. I believe this for a couple of reasons. First and foremost because no one knows students better than teachers!! Teachers would have real expectations, not far feached or underestimated. Another reason is because teachers are constantly assessing students anyways. Teachers could collabrate together to make these tests and some teachers with more service time could proof read these tests. I think it would empower teachers and help them with the stress load that they are constantly dealing with. I also believe that students would feel more comfortable as well. Some students just do not perform well on standardized tests. Teacher made tests might help the students feel more at ease. Especially if they know that one of their teachers in their school helped prepare them. Just a thought!![[User:Hcomb003|Hcomb003]] ([[User talk:Hcomb003|talk]]) 16:49, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

What's wrong with a teacher making a test to reflect the SOL standards they've taught in their classroom and giving that to their students?  The principal or even a third party could review the test to make sure it followed the SOLs, then it could be given.  There is so much pressure on the kids at the end of the year to &quot;pass those SOLs&quot; and I don't believe that all students perform well on these standardized tests. Are teachers no longer trusted to teach and give tests?  [[Special:Contributions/97.80.242.214|97.80.242.214]] ([[User talk:97.80.242.214|talk]]) 23:38, 7 August 2009 (UTC) [[User:Sciaston|Sciaston]] ([[User talk:Sciaston|talk]]) 23:15, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

Teacher-made tests seem to be a practicle approach for teachers to assess the knowledge their students have gained during lessons. I think SOL's can be used mainly as a guideline for what students &quot;should&quot; know according to standards set by the state. Teacher-made tests can follow the SOL guidelines, but go into more detail so that the teacher can decide if they need to reteach some areas or take a different approach so that the majority of students understand and retain the knowledge from the instruction. I also think that teacher-made tests might not promote stressful competition among students in the district as a whole, because the tests would be specialized and not generalized like the SOL's. Teacher-made tests also brings back creativity in teachers that they have not been able to utilize in a long time due to government, state and local regulations. Learning should be fun otherwise what is the point. If learning is not fun and there is no room for deviation from the norm of standardization...students lose interest and usually find destructive ways of occupying their time instead of constructive ways. I am not one for tests in the first place, let alone tests that are generalized. I think I would be able to fair better on tests that were generated with a creative flare, with topics and questions I could relate too, than tests that are standard that I have no interest in.[[User:Scarlett1|Scarlett1]] ([[User talk:Scarlett1|talk]]) 22:02, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

== Portfolios ==
Although tests, either standardized or created by the teacher, would be easier to grade, I actually think that portfolio would give a better assessment of a student and a general view of their strengths and weaknesses. It is true that portfolio do require more time on the teacher because they have to spend a large quantity of time preparing and evaluating it for each student. There is also the problem that if students do not know how to use technology, it will take more instruction time on the teacher in order to have an accurate portfolio. However the quantity of time spent on a portfolio would be worth the quality of it because we would see how strong a student is in writing, how weak there are in reading, if they perform better in hands-on activities, and so forth. More importantly, the assessment of the portfolio will not only benefit the current teacher, but future teachers as well because they will have at least a glance of what individual students, small groups and the class overall can do and cannot do. Portfolios are also beneficial for the students themselves because they can see what specific areas they are strong in, what areas they need to work on , how far they have come from the beginning of the school year to the end. I do think that students should take some form of a teacher made test, however it does not have to be the conventional multiple choice/fill-in-the-blank/short answer test. A class may be full of students who understand the material and not do well on these types of tests. For these students, teachers can have them do hands-on or creative activities in place of test. For example, if a 3rd grade class is taking a test on rocks, they can choose to take a multiple choice test, or they can take a hands-on test. The teacher could have different stations with different rocks and students would have to write down what type of rock it is. [[User:Adart001|Adart001]] ([[User talk:Adart001|talk]]) 17:34, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

I believe the students should be able to be assessed by portfolios created during school.  While this would create more work for the teachers, it would give a better example of students abilities.  Tests do not always accurately reflect students' abilities.  Many students suffer from test anxiety and therefore, their test results often indicate deceiving levels of ability.  Portfolio assessments eliminate test anxiety and provide more accurate descriptions of ability.  They can also be used to show progression and not just an end result. [[User:Jtmitchem|Jtmitchem]] ([[User talk:Jtmitchem|talk]]) 16:53, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

Portfolios sound like a good idea. I have to do portfolios in college since I am an art major ... the same theory should work for any subject and would show that a student does understand what they are learning. It would also take the stress off for students who are not good test takers. [[User:Hcogg001|Hcogg001]] ([[User talk:Hcogg001|talk]]) 23:45, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

I think that portfolios could be a good idea. Students will be able to clearly look back and learn from mistakes, etc. There would be more project based and possibly cooperative learning as well. [[User:Alucy001|Alucy001]] ([[User talk:Alucy001|talk]]) 02:42, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

Portfolios are probably the best, but also the most difficult solution. If practicality were not an issue I’d go with portfolios. They give a much clearer concept of a student’s knowledge as a whole and are less arbitrary than other methods. Not to mention they provide practical experience to a student rather than “test taking” experience. Portfolios also often come in handsome folders, some even with glitter. Yay, glitter.

== No more SOL's! ==

I would propose a contest ala Revenge of The Nerds. Baring that– I would want to see a lenient national curriculum in place, and some basis of assessment that doesn't stink. Hey- I do like portfolios. They can easily showcase how a student has developed and what they've learned. The entire mindset of surmising how much a child has achieved based upon a scoring system with no true definable standard needs to be re imagined. [[User:Hsmit022|Hsmit022]] ([[User talk:Hsmit022|talk]]) 22:22, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

The SOL tests may have seemed like a good idea when they were originally proposed, but I believe that they have done nothing but lower learning standards and squelch teacher's creativity. Because of the strict curriculum guidelines set by the SOL's, teachers can not make up their own curriculum or teach what they want. I think that the SOL should be discontinued. Schools should not have to teach their students only the bare minimum, causing them to miss out on all the other great things they could be learning. I do not think, that teaching should be free from any guidelines, though. I think that teachers should have to adhere to a general set of guidelines, that say, for example, &quot;in their English class, all 11th grade students should read Huckleberry Finn, and Hamlet, and should complete a term paper. In addition to this, the teacher can assign any other novels or projects that they want.&quot; If schools had guidelines like this, students would not only learn things that they need to know, but the teachers could get creative with what they teach and how they teach it. Also, teachers could have higher expectations for their students, causing their students to do better in school, overall. I think that getting rid of the SOL tests and letting the teachers teach how and what they want with higher expectations would create better students. [[User:Sbutl016|Sbutl016]] ([[User talk:Sbutl016|talk]]) 17:56, 6 August 2009 (UTC)


I wouldn't necessarily want to eliminate the SOLs themselves, but I would want to eliminate the actual testing.  The SOLs do provide a decent foundation for curriculum development.  I just want to be able to expand my lessons and make learning fun again.  Let's include more hands-on learning!  I miss making art projects in the classroom, not just in art class.  If a science class is learning about plants, it would be great to take time to learn about the job of a aquatic plant pathologist and head down to the lake to see what he does as well as explore the creatures in that habitat.  What a great way to encourage exploration and knowledge for all types of learners.  So I day, &quot;Down with the tests!&quot; and eliminate the stress.  We can increase student (&amp; teacher) expectations and making learning fun again.  [[User:Acrow005|Acrow005]] ([[User talk:Acrow005|talk]]) 18:48, 6 August 2009 (UTC)


I actually do not mind the SOL’s.  I just think the narrowed curriculum and the high-stakes testing does not show mastery of a subject at all.  I agree there should always be a baseline for what students need to learn.  However, summative, multiple choice testing does not show mastery.  It would be better to have a combination of portfolios and multiple choice testing on less material.  It would be best to also give short answer tests on less material.  If you have to give tests, give them after each unit.  In addition, our teaching of subject discipline has to change as well.  The old teacher-centered, worksheet classrooms have to be disposed of.  Our old methodologies have to change to something more formative.  We need classrooms and students that are constantly being evaluated by everyday activities.  We need to foster a more integrative approach.  A more hands-on, project-based approach.  We have so many ADHD kids because who wants to sit in a desk and be “taught” for eight hours a day?  I do not even want that.  We need to adopt methods that allow students some choice in materials so they can better retain the information.  My ideas on this topic could go on forever. [[User:Abitt002|Abitt002]] ([[User talk:Abitt002|talk]]) 18:15, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

I think students have enough finals at the end of the semesters, now they also have to do SOL's. I think that if students can prove their knowledge by passing their final exams, that should be enough. I think that if students pass their test during class there is no need for SOL's. I think that if we had a national curriculum where all teachers are given the topics of what they needs to be taugh, students would learn and want to learn more. Allot of students suffer from text anxiety and have trouble taking a test like SOL. many students are capable of proving knowledge juat maybe not through and SOL test.[[User:Bpenn005|Bpenn005]] ([[User talk:Bpenn005|talk]]) 20:48, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

I think that the theory and practice of SOLs is sound.  The issue that I have is there is such an emphasis on passing these tests that this is really what some teachers are teaching to.  Evidence of this is in late May after the tests are over, how many teachers find that they have nothing to do?  I know that there must be a standardized test that must be given to ensure that benchmarks are beig met, but this is a huge emphasis on a passing test, for the schools and the student.  I am not sure that this is the way to correctly evaluate knowledge if the reality is that some students are not great test takers and the stress is way too great.[[User:Jnewh001|Jnewh001]] ([[User talk:Jnewh001|talk]]) 19:53, 8 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

===About the Mac's History===
In 1984, a company called Apple Computer Inc. introduced a computer called the Macintosh. It was billed as the first computer that anyone could pick up and immediately understand. Rather than typing in arcane system commands, Mac users interacted with their computers using a device called a mouse. Using this device, they could manipulate visuals on the computer's display. To organize these visuals, The Macintosh used a system of overlapping squares called &quot;windows&quot;. 

Apple Computer's Lisa is often credited as being the first computer to use a Graphical User Interface, however the Xerox Alto (1973) preceded it by almost 11 years. The Lisa was the first ''mass-market'' (as ''mass-market'' as a $9,995 computer can be) computer to use a GUI and a mouse, a vast improvement over the older system that forced users to memorize a series of commands to perform even the most basic tasks. Other GUI-based operating systems of this period were Microsoft Windows 1.0 (by most accounts an abortion) and Digital Research's GEM, both which bore such a close resemblance to the Mac OS that legal action was taken.

By Microsoft's fourth major release of Windows for consumers, which was called Windows 95, Windows had surpassed the Mac technologically. Apple's maverick CEO, Steve Jobs, credited as the co-creator of the Mac, had been fired and was now running a high-end computing company called NeXT. Apple went through a long stretch of problematic management and failed to maintain the Mac OS, which stayed stagnant with only cosmetic improvements.

In 1997, Apple bought NeXT and its NeXTSTEP operating system, thereby bringing Steve Jobs back into the company. He started as an advisor to CEO Gil Amelio, but quickly moved up the ranks to interim CEO, and finally as Apple's full-time CEO. Under Steve, Apple began introducing groundbreaking new computers, including the original iMac. But they were still powered by the antiquated Mac OS. Therefore, it came as no surprise when in the year 2000, Steve Jobs unveiled Mac OS X, an all-new Mac OS that would carry Apple into the new millennium.

===About Mac OS X===
Mac OS X (the &quot;X&quot; is the Roman numeral ten) looks a bit like its predecessor, Mac OS 9, but underneath this familiar skin, Mac OS X has nothing in common with Mac OS 9. While Mac OS X is a totally new operating system based on Unix, it can run Mac OS 9 applications through the Classic software. In addition, Mac OS X sports a redesigned interface, which although inspired by previous versions of the Mac OS, is dramatically simplified and uses high-quality photorealistic graphics.

Since the original version of Mac OS X was introduced, it has gone from a futuristic concept to a full-fledged, feature-rich operating system that can handle home, business, and multimedia tasks with ease. The original version of Mac OS X, version 10.0 (code-named &quot;Cheetah&quot;), was very incomplete and was hard to use as a primary operating system. Since the original version, Apple has shipped major updates to Mac OS X -- each dramatically improving the last version, and adding interesting new features and ideas.

One version of the Mac OS is version 10.4 (&quot;Tiger&quot;). Tiger brought many interesting features to Mac OS X. Five new features in this groundbreaking release are:

*'''Spotlight''', an amazing new search technology
*'''Dashboard''', an environment for running tiny applications called &quot;Widgets&quot;
*'''Automator''', an all-new application for performing repetitive tasks
*'''Multi-person AV Conferencing''' in the new version of iChat
*'''RSS''', an emerging web standard supported in the new version of Safari

In total, Apple claims over 200 new features in Tiger over its predecessor Panther, although over half are hidden from view and help your Mac run faster and more reliably, and many others are updates to existing features.

{{Mac Background Box| Ever wonder why versions of the Mac OS have a jungle cat's name in their title? These are the project code names that Apple used to refer to the software while it was being developed. Apple's marketing department has been appending each Mac OS version's internal &quot;code name&quot; to it's title, making it much easier to tell versions apart.  Version 10.0 was code-named &quot;Cheetah&quot;, version 10.1 was named &quot;Puma&quot;, version 10.2 was named &quot;Jaguar&quot;, version 10.3 was named &quot;Panther&quot;, 10.4 was named &quot;Tiger&quot;, and the now released 10.5 is named &quot;Leopard&quot;. The next release, 10.6, is named &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;}}

====The Mac OS X Server====
[[w:Mac OS X Server|Mac OS X Server]] is a suite of services and tools built around the [[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] operating system, which itself is derived from the [[w: FreeBSD| FreeBSD]] Unix implementation. The majority of the services in Mac OS X Server are implementations or derivatives of [[w:open-source software|open-source software]], such as [[w:LDAP|LDAP]], [[w:Kerberos|Kerberos]], [[w:Postfix|Postfix]], [[w:Cyrus|Cyrus]], [[w:SquirrelMail|SquirrelMail]], [[w:Apache server|Apache]], [[w:BIND|BIND]], and so on. Other technologies are Apple originals, such as [[w:QuickTime Streaming Server|QuickTime Streaming Server]] and [[w:Xgrid|Xgrid]]. Much of the interface to Mac OS X Server is custom Apple-developed [[w:GUI|GUI]] applications, most importantly Server Admin and Workgroup Manager.

Currently, Mac OS X Server runs on a variety of modern [[w:Apple Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] computers. Its primary implementation is on the Apple [[w:Xserve|Xserve]], a high-performance, [[w:1U|1U]] [[w:rack mounted|rack-mounted]] server. The server software can, however, be installed on any Macintosh computer that supports at least the minimum hardware requirements for the product. Mac OS X Server comes in two editions: a 10-client edition and an unlimited-client edition.

This module covers Mac OS X Server version 10.4 Tiger, which will operate on any of the following computers: Xserve G5, Xserve (G4), Power Mac G5, Power Mac G4, Macintosh Server G4, Power Macintosh G3 (Blue &amp; White), Macintosh Server G3 (Blue &amp; White), iMac G5, iMac (G4), eMac (G4) or Mac mini (G4) computer.

[[w:Open Directory|Open Directory]] is the directory and network authentication services architecture at the core of [[Mac OS X Server]] from [[w:Apple Computer|Apple Computer]]. It is based on [[w:OpenLDAP|OpenLDAP]] and is optionally secured by Kerberos. It communicates with Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Unix computers, as well as with external LDAP servers.

=====Open Directory=====
[[w:Open Directory|Open Directory]] is the directory and network authentication services architecture at the core of Mac OS X Server from [[w:Apple Computer|Apple Computer]]. A fundamental to much of your Mac OS X Server implementation, as it is the basis for user authentication and management. It is based on [[w:OpenLDAP|OpenLDAP]] and is optionally secured by Kerberos. It communicates with Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Unix computers, as well as with external LDAP servers.

You can set up a basic Open Directory implementation by using only the stock administration utilities from Apple, namely Server Admin and Workgroup Manager, given a few requirements: hostname resolution of the host that will act as Open Directory Master, in both forward and reverse directions, is a notable example. More complex implementations (and troubleshooting) will require deeper understanding of [[w:LDAP|LDAP]], [[w:Kerberos|Kerberos]], and Open Directory itself.

DNS configuration can be necessary if, for example, the network in which Open Directory is to be implemented already has an appropriate setup, such as a DNS server.  The ZeroConf setting of Macs, as distributed, does not involve hostname resolution; this seems to be a problem with setting up Open Directory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Using this Wikibook==
The team of authors writing this wikibook use a few tricks to make things easier for you. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with them now. If you are confused about the concepts some of these tricks deal with, you'll probably pick them up as you become more comfortable using your computer.

===Menu Arrows===
Arrows &gt; Like &gt; These are used to show hierarchy in menus. For example, &quot;Open the menu labeled File, open the menu inside labeled Open With, and then click on the item labeled Preview&quot; could be abbreviated to &quot;File &gt; Open With &gt; Preview&quot;.

===The File-system===
Likewise, slashes/like/these are used for file locations. &quot;/Applications/Utilities&quot; is shorthand for &quot;Open your hard drive window. Inside is a folder labeled Applications. Open it. Inside the Applications folder is another another folder labeled Utilities. Open that.&quot;

If a file location begins with a slash, it means that the location is given from your main hard drive. If a file location begins with a tilde (~), it means that the location is given from your home folder. You'll learn about these places in Chapter 3.

===Shortcut Shorthand===
The second most important use of the keyboard (after inputting data) is executing &quot;keyboard shortcuts&quot;. A keyboard shortcut, also known as a keystroke, is a sequence of keys that activates a command or feature in the frontmost program. 

A keystroke is activated by holding down one or more &quot;modifier keys&quot; and then pressing another key, usually a letter. The combination of modifier keys changes (modifies) the function the letter keys on your keyboard.

There are four modifier keys on the Mac keyboard. Their names, markings, and the symbols used to represent them in this Wikibook are listed in the table below.

{{Mac Note Box|Some Mac laptop keyboards aren't quite large enough to fit every key on them. Apple solves this problem by doubling up two functions on one key. To switch a laptop key to its second meaning, hold down the special laptop-exclusive fifth modifier key, called &quot;Function&quot; and marked with &quot;Fn&quot;.}}


Around the Mac OS and in this wikibook, keystrokes are written using shorthand. Modifier keys are represented by the symbols listed in Table 1. &quot;Press the &quot;B&quot; key while holding down Command&quot; is written as &quot;⌘B&quot;. &quot;Press the &quot;B&quot; key while holding down Command and Option simultaneously&quot; is written as &quot;⌘⌥B&quot;. 


{{Mac Background Box|Ever wonder why Apple uses that little cloverleaf (⌘) as the official symbol for the command key? In the original 1984 Mac, the plan was to use the Apple logo as the symbol for it, but this made menus full of keyboard shortcuts look very cluttered. So the lead Mac designer leafed through a book of symbols and found the squiggle we now know as the command key symbol, which is used on Swedish campground signs to mark places of interest.}}

===Synonyms===
There are a few sets of words used in this wikibook that mean the exact same thing and are used interchangeably. They are:
*Application, App, Program, Piece of Software
*Users, Accounts, and User Accounts
*Delete and Backspace - Both refer to the key without a ⌦ symbol

===Commonly Confused Keys===
Apple Keyboards have a few keys that are named differently from their PC counterparts, and many users call keys by unofficial names. This section will clarify different keys on the Apple Keyboard.
*PC keyboards have two enter keys. On the Mac, one of them is called Return. However, both keys do the same exact thing 99 percent of the time. Therefore, the terms &quot;enter&quot; and &quot;return&quot; are often used interchangeably.
*Most Mac keyboards have two delete keys. One has a ⌦ on it to indicate that it deletes the next character rather than the previous one. To avoid confusion between these two delete keys, it's acceptable to refer to the one with  a ⌦ as &quot;forward delete&quot; and the one without as &quot;backspace&quot;.
*The key with an Apple logo and a squiggle is often called the Apple key. '''This is incorrect'''. The correct name of the key is &quot;Command&quot;.

{{Mac Note Box|This wikibook assumes you are using an American keyboard. Apple's foreign keyboards often feature different keys and symbols than their American counterparts.}}

===Windows versus windows===
Windows with a capital &quot;W&quot; is the Mac OS competitor produced by Microsoft. A window with a lowercase &quot;w&quot; is the paradigm modern computer interfaces are built around, which is what Microsoft named its operating system after.

==Info Boxes===
A computer book mainstay, info boxes have called attention to important tips and warnings for ages. This wikibook is no exception, and it uses four different flavors of info box. These four kinds are shown below:

{{Mac Note Box|These boxes contain handy &quot;sidebar&quot; information that doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the chapter. It's recommended that you read them, since they're often quite interesting.}}

{{Mac Warning Box|Look out! Not reading these yellow boxes could cause major headaches and the loss of time, data, or equipment!}}

{{Mac Trick Box|Essential? Maybe not. Fun? Of course. Learn about hidden features and keystrokes in these boxes.}}

{{Mac Background Box|Gather 'round a Background box for a bit of Macintosh history! These boxes are often quite interesting, and are a must for the budding Mac fanatic.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About this Book==
Although considered easier to use than the competition, learning to use a Mac is not without its challenges. Many everyday commands work differently on a Mac, and new users usually find they have much to learn before they can fully take advantage of their new operating system.

Apple includes a built-in help system with Tiger (you can access it at any time by pressing ⌘?), and maintains an online support website for it [http://www.apple.com/support/tiger here]. However, Apple's documentation, like most software manufacturers', has often been labeled as lacking. So what's a new Mac user to do?

Many new users will pay their local bookshop a visit, leaf through a couple books about Mac OS X, pick out the one they like best, fork over $30, and begin reading. But now, with the existence of this book, this age-old new computer tradition is no longer necessary. You can use this site to learn all about Mac OS X for free. We promise that there are no hidden charges for using this site!

Wikibooks are edited by a community of writers. We encourage you to join this community and help out once you learn how to use the Mac OS. See a confusing explanation of how to do something? Once you figure out a better way to explain, come back and fix it for everyone else. In a traditional book, you can't help other readers understand something the author explained poorly. When an update comes out, books don't magically change to reflect the changes to the software. This is especially important for Mac OS X, because Apple introduces a large number of updates and products over the course of an operating system's life. A well-maintained book is always up-to-date, so you can be sure you're reading the latest information.

{{Mac Note Box|If you feel compelled to try your hand at editing this book, your first step should be to get involved with the Mac user group on Wikibooks, which is called the [[Wikibooks:WikiProject Macintosh|WikiProject Macintosh]].}}

Whether you're an average computer user who's decided that the grass is greener on the Mac side of the fence, a refugee from the security problems plaguing Microsoft Windows, a multimedia maven looking to take advantage of Apple's unparalleled iLife suite, or are a Windows user who's been given a Mac at work, you'll find this book to be your new best friend. It will thoroughly and clearly explain how to use Mac OS X and its included applications. It will also help you to fix problems that may arise while using your Mac. Even experienced Mac users can learn something.

If you're looking for help with Apple's iLife suite of digital media applications, check out this Wikibooks companion title, [[iLife]]. This book will also skip over the very basics of personal computing (e.g. how to use a mouse), [[Mac OS X Server]], and Mac development.

The goal is to get a songbook whith copyright-free songs for various occasions. These songs can be arranged for all instruments. Thus the song book addresses itself to a quite large target group.
Above all, however, Lyrics with chord accompaniments will be collected.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Four Basic Types of Postage Meters ==
* &lt;font size=3&gt;The first postage meters were Fixed Value, i.e. they contained either a single postage stamp die or a small number of dies with different postage amounts. Each die was a complete stamp.
* A technological improvement was to Limited Value meters which contained a single stamp frame die containing a slot into which a range of different small value dies could be inserted. Since value dies are much smaller than complete stamp dies, Limited Value machines were capable of printing many more stamps of different values than Fixed Value meters.
* A further improvement was to Multi-value meters which also contained a single slotted stamp frame die but instead of a set of different value dies it contained wheels with numbers embossed on the rim. The wheels could be rotated so the postage amount would appear in the slot of the frame die. A meter with three of these wheels was called a 3-bank multi-value machine, and it could print any postage value from 000 to 999. A 4-bank meter an inserted decimal could print any postage value from 00.00 to 99.99.
* Most recently postage meters have adopted digital technology which does away with solid dies altogether. The entire stamp is printed by a thermal, dot matrix, ink jet, or laser process. Solid dies have ceased to exist.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

[[File:Fixed value dies.jpg|left|260px]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''1. Fixed Value (FV, FV-n)'''. The entire stamp is printed from a single die.
: Some FV meters contain a small selection of frank dies with different postage values.
: Such meters are designated FV-n with ‘n’ being the number of different frank dies.
: The earliest meters are of this type.





[[File:Limited value dies.jpg|left|260px]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''2. Limited Value (LV-n)'''. The stamp is printed from a frame die plus a value die.
: Such meters are designated LV-n with 'n' being the number of different value dies available.
: Because a value die is much smaller than a complete stamp, typically LV-n machines have a much larger range of postage values than a FV-n meter. 






[[File:MeterCat MultiValue diagram.jpg|left|320px]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''3. Multi Value (MV)'''. The stamp is printed from a frame die plus a postage value made from numbers embossed on the rims of rotating wheels.
: The wheels are located above a slot in the frank die and are rotated so that the postage amount appears inside the slot.
: Any denomination within a range determined by the number of wheels can be printed.
: Some MV machines are fitted with trailing fixed zeros to accommodate inflation, currency changes, etc.
: In the descriptions for value figures, this catalog identifies all value places and does not differentiate between regular and fixed zeros.







'''4. Digital (digital)'''. Digital postage meters do not have a solid die but print the stamp with dot-matrix, thermal, ink jet or laser technology.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

== Value Figures ==

 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;The shape of value figures in meter stamps are nearly always a version of Angular, Gothic or Oval fonts. Many variations exist, and some typical examples are shown below.
*In the listings the catalog normally does not identify the shape of value figures unless more than one basic shape was used. In such cases “A” (angular) “G” (gothic), and “O” (oval) are used to identify the shape. As can be seen from the examples, variations exist based on size, slant and other features. Such varieties are not differentiated in this catalog but specialized catalogs often describe them.

 [[File:value figures.jpg|center|400px]]


:'''NOTE''': For Egypt and most other Arab countries, many meter types have bi-lingual value figures, Eastern Arabic over modern Western numerals (١٢٣٤٥٦٧٨٩٠ above 1234567890). The catalog uses the abbreviated term ‘Arabic over Western’ to describe these value figures.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Town Marks ==
 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;The term town mark (or town/date mark) is not entirely accurate. The implication is the town is where the mailer is located, but in fact it is the name of the post office where the meter is licensed. Although the two are usually the same, they are not always. This catalog uses “Town Mark” instead of “Post Office Mark” because of its near universal use in the hobby.

*Although some meter stamp types have no town mark (nil), most do. Basically, they are either &lt;b&gt;Straight Line (SL)&lt;/b&gt; or Circular.

*Circular town marks can be &lt;b&gt;Single Circle (SC)&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Double Circle (DC)&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;Broken Inner Circle (BIC)&lt;/b&gt; with arcs in place of the inner circle.

*Many variations of SC, DC and BIC exist, and most specialized catalogs identify them. Below are shown some of these variations. This catalog indicates only if the stamp has SL, SC, DC or BIC town marks or no town mark (nil) without going into greater detail.
&lt;br&gt;
*Examples:&lt;/font&gt;
[[File:town marks.jpg|500px]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Spacing ==
 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;Some meter models produce stamps that appear identical to those from other models except in minor details. One such detail for many stamps is the spacing (sometimes called the 'setting') which is the distance between the town mark and the frank. This catalog measures spacing from the right edge of the town mark to the left edge of the frank, with one important exception. Early Francotyp meter types are measured from the center of the date figures to the center of the value figures. This is the most reliable way to differentiate early Francotyp model A, B, C and An (D) stamps.
&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Dates ==
 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;If known, the first year of use or first day date is included in the stamp description. If the first year of use is not known, the earliest reported date or no date is shown.&lt;/font&gt;
 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Identification Numbers ==
 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;All postage meters are assigned an identity number by the manufacturer, and for many countries this number appears in the stamp. This manufacturer-designated number is called the Meter Number, and when it is included in the stamp, it is often preceded by a letter prefix identifying the manufacturer, model or distributor.

*Some postal authorities assign Identification Numbers to postage meters, and this too can appear in the stamp. This is not a meter number but a locally-assigned number. Identification numbers, just like meter numbers, can have prefixes.

*Most countries use a License (Permit) numbering system, which is assigned to the mailer rather than the machine, and this too occasionally appears in the stamp. A license number changes if the same meter is re-assigned from one mailer to another, but a meter number or identification number does not.

*Several countries have changed numbering systems over time. Some have gone from using license numbers to meter numbers, from identification numbers to no numbers, etc, etc. A few have required both a license and a meter number, and some even require the mailer’s name or initials to appear in the stamp.

*An additional number found on many meter stamps is an Impression Counter which this catalog sometimes calls a Serial Number. (Others have labeled this a Record Number.) The serial number or impression counter is a simple, incremental counter of stamp impressions made by the machine and is not an identification number. Serial numbers can appear at many places on a meter stamp and in several sizes. These are identified in the next segment.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

== Serial Numbers (Impression Counter Numbers) ==
 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;Serial Numbers, simple incremental counters of stamp impressions made by a meter, appear in some stamps.

* They were most often used with early Francotyp Model A, B and C machines and also with Komusina, and early Hasler and Krag models.

* Francotyp serial numbers are 4-digit and appear between the town mark and the frank, centered or high. The centered number can be large or small.

* Hasler serial numbers are uniform in size, 5-digit, and appear to the left of the town mark (either high or low) or between the town mark and the frank.

* Komusina numbers are 6-digit, vertical reading down at far left.
&lt;br&gt;                        

[[File:Serial number examples.jpg|left|780px]]

::'''Left: Centered Francotyp serial number.[[File:MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|20px]] Right: Vertical Komusina serial number reading down.'''


* Although specialized catalogs identify varieties based on the size and placement of the serial number, this catalog (at present) does not.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Colors ==
 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;Most meter stamps from the 20th century are printed in shades of red, but blue, purple and black stamps are not uncommon. Green and orange are uncommon colors, and yellow and brown are rare. Recent digital stamps, especially from Europe, are found mostly in blue.

* Some meter models are capable of printing the slogan in a different color from the stamp. A few creative users have manipulated non-capable meters to produce bi-color stamps.
&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Values ==

* &lt;font size=3&gt;For stamp types and varieties with an estimated value of five U.S. dollars or higher a catalog value is usually given. These values are estimates of what a reasonable price would be for a ''clear impression on commercial (non-philatelic) cover in a transaction between a dealer and knowledgeable collector''.

*  Catalog values should not be taken literally. Meter stamps are not widely collected compared to traditional stamps, and buyers can be scarce even for rarities.

* In some cases clear impressions on full, non-philatelic covers may not exist, and values are given accordingly.

* The listings show catalog values between square brackets, e.g. [[File:MeterCat 5 spaces.jpg|8px]][$25]&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Illustrations ==
 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;Many illustrations have been graphically enhanced by elimination of extraneous markings. Those in black are scanned from the original 2005 paper edition of ''The International Postage Meter Stamp Catalog''.

* An attempt was made to make all illustrations at actual size, but this proved impossible due to the wide variety of monitors and screen resolutions in use. A small number of sub-varieties are illustrated deliberately at reduced size, and these should be obvious.&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Hints for Collectors ==
 
* &lt;font size=3&gt;No rules exist for how to collect meter stamps, but the following suggestions may increase your enjoyment.
&lt;br&gt;
#	'''Ask yourself exactly what you want to collect'''. Is it the entire world, the stamps of a single country, those from one manufacturer or meter model, or something else? Once you know the scope of your interest, decide how deeply you want to collect. You can acquire one of each Type as listed in this catalog, or you can go a little deeper and add the listed varieties. Go deeper still and add all variations and value figure configurations. And finally, if your interest takes you beyond this catalog, you can collect essays, specimens, proofs, errors, usages, and minor varieties described in specialized catalogs. If no specialized catalog exists for your country or specialty, you have an opportunity to write one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#	'''What format do you want for your collection'''? You can collect any size from entire covers to small cut-outs or tapes. Each format has different advantages. By cutting out the stamps and soaking tapes off covers, you form a collection that is convenient in size but has been stripped of its postal history value. A collection of meter stamps on cover preserves the context of the use of the stamp but takes up much more space. Although a cover collection can be a problem to store, it is multi-dimensional and retains far more value than a collection of cuts and tapes. In practice most collectors accumulate a wide variety of formats. Although they may prefer covers, often they will find some stamp types are effectively unobtainable except as cutouts due to the hasty scissors of early collectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
#	'''Storing and Mounting'''. Boxes or albums are the two most common choices. Boxes are inexpensive but are inconvenient for viewing the collection. Albums can be amazingly expensive, but they compel you to organize your collection into a logical sequence leaving you with an organized and well presented collection. If you use albums, DO NOT use photo albums with sticky, waxy pages. The wax makes covers and stamps easy to mount (since you don't need hinges or adhesive mounts), but over time the wax will permeate and destroy any paper stuck to it.&lt;/font&gt;

== A Short History of the Early Years of Meter Franking ==
 
&lt;li&gt; &lt;font size=3&gt;Not long after the introduction of adhesive stamps in 1840 it became apparent to volume mailers that a system requiring the purchase, moistening and affixing of small pieces of gummed paper to stacks of envelopes was too slow. Research into speeding the process gave birth to a machine which automated the application of postage, i.e. the postage meter.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carle Busch of Paris appears to have been first to devise a postage metering system. In August 1884 he received a British patent describing an apparatus for impressing and registering stamps. The Busch invention never saw service.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;di Brazza stamp, 1897, world's first meter stamp used on actual mail&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;li&gt;Parallel to the efforts to streamline the franking of business mail, other inventors looked for ways to provide 24-hour access to postage for the general public. The first postage meter used to frank actual mail was of this type. It was invented by the Italian, Count Detalmo di Brazza Savorgnan. A small number of his public access, self-service meters were installed in New York City in 1896 and 1897. For reasons now unknown, they were removed from service after only a few months of use.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Norway A1.jpg|center|100px]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kahrs stamp, 1900&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;li&gt;In Norway, on 24 August 1900, another coin-operated machine, invented by Charles A. Kahrs, was installed in the lobby of the main post office in Kristiania (Oslo). After obtaining a frank, the customer still had to carry his mail to the post office window where the clerk applied an adhesive stamp over the frank. The machine stamp was thus used only as a receipt for prepayment rather than as the actual postage. The machine was removed from service after only three weeks of use.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Norway A2.jpg|center|100px]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uchermann/Krag stamp, 1903&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;li&gt;Another Norwegian, Karl Uchermann, has the honor of inventing the first business mail automated franking system. The company Krag Maskinfabrik manufactured Uchermann’s machines, and they were placed in seven post offices as well as the mail rooms of five private businesses in 1903. They are known used from June 15th of that year to at least January 2nd, 1905. Norway abandoned the use of postage meters at that time and did not employ them again until 1926.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:New Zealand A1.jpg|center|100px]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moss stamp, 1904&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;li&gt;New Zealand has the record for continual use of postage meters. A coin-in-the-slot machine invented by Ernest Moss of Christchurch was tested on public mail in March 1904. The design was flawed, and Moss quickly submitted improved versions for testing. His first “credit” machine saw service in 1906, and by 1907 fifty of these machines were in use around the country. Several other models were placed into use between 1907 and 4 January 1921 when meter franking was first recognized by the Universal Postal Union. Until that date, the Moss stamps were valid for domestic mail only. Meter franked mail addressed to foreign countries was taken to the post office where clerks would apply complimentary adhesives stamps or “PAID” hand stamps to make them acceptable in international mail.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:New Zealand A4.jpg|center|100px]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wales stamp, 1904&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;li&gt;Moss did not have the field to himself in New Zealand. Mr. Robert Wales invented a machine similar to that of Moss’s, and it was trialed outside the General Post Office of Dunedin from July 1904 to February 1905. The machine was considered inferior to that of Moss and was rejected for further testing.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Australia public trials of self-service postage meters took place as early as 1903. A machine invented by a Mr. W. Hollingworth was used on a trial basis in Brisbane for a few weeks of that year. No example of the Hollingworth stamp is known to survive today, and we do not know what it looked like. In 1908, machines invented by R.J. Price and H.A. Beswicke were live-tested in Melbourne over two periods lasting a few days. The trials were not successful. The only known copies of the Price/Beswicke stamps are proofs in Australian postal archives.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
[[File:USA A2new.jpg|center|200px]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pitney stamp, 1912&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, in the United States, Arthur H. Pitney with Eugene A. Rummler, designed and built a postage meter that the Post Office Department tested in Washington D.C. in March 1903. Authorities were not impressed, and no more official testing was done until May 1912 when an improved Pitney machine was placed into limited use, again in Washington D.C. At least eight of these machines were given a wider test in 1914 in Chicago. Despite its apparent success, the post office did not sanction use of this meter.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the urging of the U.S. Post Office Department, Walter H. Bowes, owner of a company that made high-speed canceling machines, formed a partnership with Pitney. They merged their products into a single postage metering and mail processing machine which was given official approval by the Post Office Department in September 1920. Over the next decade several small American companies entered the postage meter market only to fail under the intense competition from Pitney Bowes.

[[File:Britain PV1.jpg|center|120px]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wilkinson stamp, 1912&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;li&gt;Great Britain is the only other country to have tested a postage meter on actual mail before UPU approval in January 1921. In 1912 a single public access, coin-operated meter, invented by Mr. F. Wilkinson, was installed in a post office in London. Although interest at first was quite high, it was removed from service after only seven months for lack of use.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machines mentioned above are not the only postage automation devices to appear in the years before 1920. In Britain, at least three inventors submitted coin-operated machines to the Post Office for testing: David Lewis in 1899, Charles Ross in 1907, and E.E. Eyles in 1909. None of their machines were ever used to frank actual mail.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the 1920s, after the UPU approval of postage meter franking, large and successful meter companies were founded in Europe. Among them are Universal Postal Frankers and Neopost (England), Francotyp and Postalia (nee Komusina, Germany), Hasler (Switzerland), Havas (France), and Sima (Italy). Since then about a hundred other companies have entered the postage meter market with varying success.

=parameter=
This template provides a range of optional parameters.

&lt;pre&gt;
{{:Songbook/template:songheader
|type =
|alternative =
|text =
|melody =
|creator =
|key =
|arranger =
|co-arranger =
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

The template itself ther is no parameter mandatory. However, two parameters should be set for each song: type and arranger.

==Parameter: type==
Documented that the song is free of copyright. So there should appear values as follows:''folk'',''verbally'',''Traditional'' or short &quot;Trad.'', ''Gospel'',''Spiritual'',''American folk song&quot; etc.''. Possibly. also an indication of the time of writing (''First publication'' ''From the ... Century,''etc.). If not specified appear &quot;Traditional&quot;.

==Parameter: arranger ==
Corresponds to the Wikibook-author and should always be given to make arrangements for change requests and corrections. The possibility can be, for example, that certain chord information which you would like to adapt to a supposed original, are essential for a lesson and the song is to be used after the apparent correction is no longer for the book project for which it was originally written.

==Parameter: co-arranger==
Will be set with an &quot;and&quot; after the arranger.

==Parameter: alternative==
Can be used for a commonly used alternative title of the piece, especially if this would be for a different lexical Einsorteirung responsible.

==Parameter: text==
Specifies the  poet, (writer).

==Parameter: melody==
Specifies the composer.

==Parameter: creator==
Can be used if the words and melody was written by a person or a group of persons

==Parameter: key==
Only needs to be specified when the key is not simply seen. Major and minor keys should be readily identifiable, church modes, however, as Dorian and Mixolydian and Phrygian, should be explained. Possibly. should this key with a link to the Harmony lesson can be used.

Bitte haben Sie Verständnis dafür, dass es nicht leicht ist, für jedes Werk den Urheber zu ermitteln, und dass man sich vielleicht auf unzuverlässige Quellen gestützt hat. (Gerade bei &quot;mündlich Überliefert&quot; und &quot;Rechte unbekannt&quot;).

Natürlich würden wir uns ebenfalls freuen, wenn Sie als Rechteinhaber den Wikibooks für das entsprechende Werk eine &quot;freundliche Genehmigung&quot; erteilen könnten.

== Eigendichtungen ==
Einige Lieder sind bewusst von den Wikibooks-Mitarbeitern so geschrieben worden, dass sie zu einer bekannten Melodie gesungen werden kann. Der Text ist für den freien privaten Gebrauch und zum Unterricht frei gegeben. Doch es gilt zu beachten, dass die Melodie noch weiterhin dem Copyright unterliegt. Daher ist eine öffentliche Aufführung nur mir mit Erlaubnis des Copyrightinhabers der Melodie möglich.

== Auszugsweises Zitieren ==
In einzelnen Fällen wurde bis zur Klärung des Copyright oder bis zur Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Copyright-Inhaber bestimmte Werke nur in Auszügen veröffentlicht, wobei sich auf UrhG § 51 &lt;ref&gt;'''UrhG § 51 Zitate''' &lt;br /&gt;
Zulässig ist die Vervielfältigung, Verbreitung und öffentliche Wiedergabe eines veröffentlichten Werkes zum Zweck des Zitats, sofern die Nutzung in ihrem Umfang durch den besonderen Zweck gerechtfertigt ist. Zulässig ist dies insbesondere, wenn
:1. einzelne Werke nach der Veröffentlichung in ein selbständiges wissenschaftliches Werk zur Erläuterung des Inhalts aufgenommen werden,
:2. Stellen eines Werkes nach der Veröffentlichung in einem selbständigen Sprachwerk angeführt werden,
:3. einzelne Stellen eines erschienenen Werkes der Musik in einem selbständigen Werk der Musik angeführt werden.
&lt;/ref&gt; berufen wird.

== unwesentliches Beiwerk ==
Für viele spieltechnische und harmonische Lektionen gibt es meines Wissens keine passenden copyrightfreien Lieder, die man als Anschauungs- (besser Anhörungs-) material verwenden kann. Und Lieder, deren Autoren vor 1939 verstarben, sind nur selten für den Gitarrenunterricht geeignet, und lassen sich auch kaum für Spieltechniken anwenden, die erst nach 1950 &quot;erfunden&quot; worden sind (z.B. Rock'n'Roll). In einzelnen Fällen werden daher Lied- und Textauszüge zur Veranschaulichung eines musikalischen oder spieltechnischen Zusammenhangs verwendet. Dabei beruft sich der Verfasser des Artikels auf UrhG § 57&lt;ref&gt;'''UrhG § 57 Unwesentliches Beiwerk'''&lt;br /&gt;Zulässig ist die Vervielfältigung, Verbreitung und öffentliche Wiedergabe von Werken, wenn sie als unwesentliches Beiwerk neben dem eigentlichen Gegenstand der
Vervielfältigung, Verbreitung oder öffentlichen Wiedergabe anzusehen sind.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Akkordfolgen und Arangements ==
Die hier veröffentlichten Akkordfolgen und Arangements sind (sofern sie nicht eindeutig zu einem copyrightfreiem Lied gehören) hauptsächlich dazu ausgewählt worden, um bestimmte spieltechnische oder harmonische Lerninhalte zu vermitteln. Wo es irgend möglich war, wurden mehr als ein Lied angegeben, welches diese oder zumindest eine sehr ähnliche Akkordfolge verwendet. Sofern ein Autor meint, dass eine bestimmte Akkordfolge nicht als eine Standard-Akkordfolge zu werten ist, und so spezifisch zu einem Lied gehört, dass diese Akkordfolge für sich allein schon eine Schöpfungshöhe erreicht hat, und damit dem Urheberschutz unterliegt, bitten wir dieses uns mitzuteilen, damit wir diese gegebenenfalls entfernen.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;Bank:&lt;/b&gt; 	a wheel with numbers on the rim which is rotated to impress part of the postage amount on &lt;u&gt;Multi Value&lt;/u&gt; meters
*&lt;b&gt;Denomination:&lt;/b&gt; 	the amount of postage shown by the &lt;u&gt;Value Figures&lt;/u&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;Die:&lt;/b&gt; 	the solid print head of a non-digital meter.
*&lt;b&gt;Digital:&lt;/b&gt; 	a meter that uses thermal, laser or some other digital technology instead of a die to apply the Stamp&lt;/u&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;Fixed Value:&lt;/b&gt; 	a meter with &lt;u&gt;Frame&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Value Figure&lt;/u&gt; carved out of a single die. A Fixed Value meter can print either a single denomination stamp or has a small set of different denomination stamps.
*&lt;b&gt;Frame:&lt;/b&gt; 	that portion of the &lt;u&gt;Frank&lt;/u&gt; surrounding the &lt;u&gt;Value Figures&lt;/u&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;Frank:&lt;/b&gt; 	Noun: that portion of the &lt;u&gt;Meter Stamp&lt;/u&gt; showing the &lt;u&gt;Denomination&lt;/u&gt; and (nearly always) the country name. Often a currency indicator ($, b, ¥, etc.) is shown along with “POSTAGE PAID” or similar statement.
::	Verb:&lt;/b&gt;  to apply a postage stamp to a piece of mail
*&lt;b&gt;Greater Border:&lt;/b&gt; 	a frame surrounding a large portion of the &lt;u&gt;Impression&lt;/u&gt; often including the &lt;u&gt;Frank&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Town Mark&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Slogan&lt;/u&gt;. This is a feature found on many early Italian stamps but is otherwise quite rare.
*&lt;b&gt;Identification Number:&lt;/b&gt; 	a meter identification number assigned by the postal authority 
*&lt;b&gt;Impression:&lt;/b&gt; 	the entire imprint including the &lt;u&gt;Stamp&lt;/u&gt; (&lt;u&gt;Frank&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Town/Date Mark&lt;/u&gt;), and, if present, &lt;u&gt;Serial number&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Slogan&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Slug&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Greater Border&lt;/u&gt;, etc.
*&lt;b&gt;Indicia/Indicium:&lt;/b&gt; 	same as &lt;u&gt;Frank&lt;/u&gt; (noun)
*&lt;b&gt;Key Letter:&lt;/b&gt; 	same as &lt;u&gt;Prefix&lt;/u&gt;

*&lt;b&gt;Limited Value:&lt;/b&gt; 	a meter that has one &lt;u&gt;Frame&lt;/u&gt; die with a slot into which several &lt;u&gt;Denomination&lt;/u&gt; dies can be rotated 
*&lt;b&gt;Mailing Machine:&lt;/b&gt; 	a device which processes outgoing mail. It can contain a feeding mechanism, an envelope sealer and a sorter as well as a postage meter.
*&lt;b&gt;Meter:&lt;/b&gt; 	for the purposes of this catalog, same as &lt;u&gt;Postage Meter&lt;/u&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;Meter Number:&lt;/b&gt; 	an identification number assigned by the meter manufacturer
*&lt;b&gt;Meter Stamp:&lt;/b&gt; 	a postage stamp impressed by a &lt;u&gt;Meter&lt;/u&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;Multi Value:&lt;/b&gt; 	a non-digital meter that can print any postage value within a specified range. The machine uses &lt;u&gt;Banks&lt;/u&gt; of wheels with numbers on the rims that are rotated to make the correct postage value appear in the stamp.
*&lt;b&gt;Panel:&lt;/b&gt;  	An area within a frank bordered by an outer frame line on two or three sides and an inner frame line on the fourth side
*&lt;b&gt;Permit Number:&lt;/b&gt; 	same as &lt;u&gt;License Number&lt;/u&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;Postage Meter:&lt;/b&gt; 	a machine that prints a postage stamp and maintains a record of the total amount of postage printed
*&lt;b&gt;Prefix:&lt;/b&gt; 	a character or characters (usually alphabetic) preceding a &lt;u&gt;Meter Number&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Identification Number&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;License/Permit Number&lt;/u&gt;
*&lt;b&gt;Relief Machine:&lt;/b&gt; 	a &lt;u&gt;Postage Meter&lt;/u&gt; lent by the distributor or dealer to a customer while the customer’s machine is being serviced

*&lt;b&gt;Spacing:&lt;/b&gt; 	the distance between the &lt;u&gt;Town Mark&lt;/u&gt; and the &lt;u&gt;Frank&lt;/u&gt;. It is usually measured from the right edge of the Town Mark to the left edge of the Frank, but with some stamps, mostly from Francotyp A, B and C models, measurements are from the center of the date figures to the center of the &lt;u&gt;Value Figures&lt;/u&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Hallo==
In the German Wikibooks there is already a songbook.
*[http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Liederbuch:_Inhalt http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Liederbuch:_Inhalt]
Around 80 songs have already been arranged. Many of them are in English. You can imagine that the German authors have much more trouble to translate a song or correct the chord-positions than a native speaker. Equally they have more problems to find the right background of the songs. We provide our work, hoping, that you will help us to correct the songs, and hoping, that you will be animated to add songs to the [[songbook]] that we can take over in our [http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Liederbuch:_Inhalt Liederbuch]. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 18:34, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

==Don't change chord-diagrams==
Until now, the chords have still a German fingering. But soon this will  changed.--[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 18:34, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

==Some authors are German==
Please be merciful with our orthographic, style and grammar. We aren't native speakers. I hope, the preparatory work in the arrangements will compensate your lector-service. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 18:34, 6 August 2009 (UTC)

== Lost VfD? ==

After pursing the Orphaned page list I came across a VfD page that probably belongs elsewhere.  It was located at [[Wikibook:Votes_for_deletion/How_To_Build_A_Teardrop_Trailer]].  I moved it to [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion/How_To_Build_A_Teardrop_Trailer]] which seemed to be the style of archiving VfD's.  If this was somehow the wrong thing to please let me know.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 09:58, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

: Looks right to me.  After being renamed, the archive page is now pointed to by the {{tlx|vfd-survived}} template on the book's talk page.  The archive page had also been alphabetized under &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt;, since it was an orphan root page in main space (not in&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;Wikibooks:&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; space).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:02, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

:Why not? [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]]) 04:49, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

:: I asked here because administrators have tools that allow them to rename many pages at one time.  I could do it myself going from page to page, but the chances of me making a mistake with the number of pages in that book was fairly high.  I thought I would ask here and ensure that it got done correctly the first time, and hopefully that would make less work for everyone.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:04, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

:::I'd like to note, for other admins' benefit, that there is a bug (with a workaround) with the mass moving. If the main book page doesn't have a talk page, any talk pages of subpages won't be moved with the subpages.  The workaround is to add a talk page to the book's main page.  Then, all the subpages ''and'' their talk pages will be moved.  There's a bugzilla bug open, thanks to [[User:Mike.lifeguard|Mike.lifeguard]] on this, but it's been open for quite a while. Yes, the words I've heard about improvements for Wikipedia getting priority over other Wikimedia wikis are true. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:23, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

== Importing from the English Wikipedia ==

Hi all,

When the page [[chess/Sample chess game]] was imported from Wikipedia to Wikibooks, its earliest edits weren't included because they were at a different title, namely &quot;Chess/Sample game&quot; as can clearly be seen from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chess/Sample_chess_game&amp;diff=745478&amp;oldid=745477 this diff]. I've temporarily undeleted the English Wikipedia page and history merged it so all the edits are at the right place. I'd like a Wikibooks admin to import [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sample_chess_game&amp;dir=prev&amp;limit=9&amp;action=history these nine edits], namely all edits before the one by Zundark, from the English Wikipedia to the Wikibooks page [[chess/Sample chess game]]. Thanks. [[User:Graham87|Graham87]] ([[User talk:Graham87|talk]]) 07:50, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

: I've merged in the edits you requested to the history of the above page.  The partial history for the page now includes [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Chess/Sample_chess_game&amp;dir=prev&amp;limit=9&amp;action=history those nine edits]. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:18, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

::Thanks very much. I've re-deleted the English Wikipedia page. [[User:Graham87|Graham87]] ([[User talk:Graham87|talk]]) 13:43, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

== A copyright question ==

As always, I am confused over copyright issues.  A contributor added [[A Brief History of SMSQ/E]] by copying and pasting from Wikipedia (or perhaps wikisource?).  This wouldn't preserve any list of editors as I thought was required by GFDL.  On the other hand I thought one thing that moving to this new combined license was supposed to allow was the ability to copy some segment of text from one place to another (provided a link to the original is provided?) Also I am generally confused about which license older documents fall under.  Have all existing pages been reliciensed? If anyone understands these issues better then me I could use a tutorial.  Also if anything needs to be done with this article it should be done. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 13:59, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:My non-expert opinion: The GFDL would require a list of editors.  CC-BY-SA would require attribution through a link.  I don't see a link in the edit summary of the page's creation or on the talk page.  So it doesn't meet either license's requirements.  Given that the page is an essay, I don't see it as textbook material personally.  

:The intro says it was written for the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SMSQ/E&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=7823417 Wikipedia article] (since removed) and that it is GFDL-licensed.  [http://www.osnews.com/story/21436/An_Insider_s_History_of_SMSQ_E|post OSnews] says it was copied to Geocities to preserve it.  I don't think that's correct.  The Wikipedia edit was in 2004 while the Geocities page was last modified in 1998.  So the licensing derives from however the Geocities page was licensed.  Given that the page has no licensing information, I would say that it's a copyright violation to have it here. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:18, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:I have contacted the contributor, [[User:Sanbeg|Sanbeg]] on their [[User talk:Sanbeg|talk page]] regarding this. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:53, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

:A list of editors may not equate with a list of copyright owners (and rarely does on Wikis), copy paste is allowed if credit is given to the original authors of the content (by GFDL or CC-BY-SA), in case of a copy for Wikipedia a reference that part of the content came from there will suffice (having the edit history is a plus). The works licenses must be equal, except for the GFDL to CC-BY-SA conversion, relicensing of works can only be done by the content owners.
:For what I understand of the explanations above originally it was on Wikipedia (2004) so that makes it GFDL, depending on the date it was taken to Geocities it could have been converted to CC-BY-SA, but the requirements to indicate the copyright owners would be the same.  
:One easy way to resolve the issue is to request Wikipedia for a undelete and a traswiki of the article. Can it be done ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:40, 29 July 2009 (UTC)
== Request for semi-protection ==

I am wondering if someone could semi-protect [[Wikibooks:Library|this page]]? This is the replacement page for [[Wikibooks:Departments]] and needs to be semi-protected accordingly. Thanks. [[User:Arlen22|Arlen22]] ([[User talk:Arlen22|talk]]) 18:37, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

&lt;font size=3&gt;The Arab Trucial State of Abu Dhabi used meter stamps at least as early as 1968. In 1971 it merged with several other Trucial States into the umbrella group United Arab Emirates. Stamps inscribed “ABU DHABI” continued to be used for many years after the merger. See also [[../United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]].

&lt;big&gt;'''Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)'''&lt;/big&gt;
:''For PSA screening, see [[Radiation Oncology/Prostate/Screening and Prevention|Screening and Prevention]].''

==History of PSA==
'''''Defining &quot;PSA era&quot;:'''''
*The beginning of the PSA era is the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein-2004&quot;&gt;Klein, Eric (ed.)(2004). ''Management of Prostate Cancer.'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=7WGIz-gT8MMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the early PSA era (beginning approx. 1987), there was an abrupt rise in the incidence of prostate cancer, with a peak in 1992, then a decrease through 1995. The incidence remained stable between 1995 and 1999, but at a higher rate than in the pre-PSA era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klein-2004&quot;/&gt;
*Approved by FDA in 1986 for disease monitoring.  Approved in 1992 for diagnosis. &lt;ref&gt;PMID 17372918 &lt;/ref&gt;


'''''PSA use in early clinical trials:'''''
*EORTC 22863 (trial began 1987) - PSA in all pts at baseline
*RTOG 85-31 and 86-10 (trials began 1987) - PSA was not widely available at the beginning of the study. Made mandatory in 1990.


==PSA Measurement==
PSA level may be affected by a number of processes:
* Minimal impact - DRE, TRUS, cystoscopy
* Impact unclear - ejaculation (some studies show no impact, others show elevation at 24 or even 48 hours)
* Significant impact - prostatic massage, needle biopsy, TURP, prostatitis


===Impact of Ejaculation===
*'''1998''' PMID 9569113 -- &quot;The effects of ejaculation on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).&quot; (Yavascaoglu I, Int Urol Nephrol. 1998).
**Conclusion: No relation between seminal plasma levels or total amounts expelled and the difference in serum levels due to ejaculation
*'''1998''' PMID 9510352 -- &quot;The effect of ejaculation on prostate-specific antigen in a prostate cancer-screening population.&quot; (Stenner J, Urology. 1998)
**Conclusion: For the total screened population, ejaculation has no clinically significant effect. Men should not be asked to abstain from sexual activities before a PSA-screening test
*'''1997''' PMID 9255295 -- &quot;Effect of ejaculation on serum total and free prostate-specific antigen concentrations.&quot; (Herschman JD, Urology. 1997)
**Conclusion: Both total and free PSA increase immediately after ejaculation, with differing rates of return to baseline levels. PSA testing within 24 hours after ejaculation may lead to an erroneous interpretation of the results of both total and percent free PSA measurements in a small proportion of men.
*'''1997''' PMID 9126226 -- The effects of prostatic manipulation on prostate-specific antigen levels. (Klein LT, Urol Clin North Am. 1997)
**Minimal effect on PSA level - DRE, TRUS, cystoscopy, and ejaculation
**Significant effect on PSA level - Prostatic massage, needle biopsy, TURP, and prostatitis
*'''1997''' PMID 9266232 -- &quot;Postejaculation serum prostate-specific antigen level.&quot; (Zisman A,  Eur Urol. 1997)
**Conclusion: A significant postejaculation serum PSA elevation does occur, it is thus recommended that men abstain from ejaculation for 24 h prior to PSA sampling.
*'''1997''' PMID 8976253 -- &quot;The influence of ejaculation on serum levels of prostate specific antigen.&quot; (Heidenreich A,  J Urol. 1997)
**Conclusion: Ejaculation does not affect serum PSA concentration in young men, and there seems to be no physiological relationship between ejaculation and PSA level.
*'''1996''' PMID 8638359 -- &quot;Ejaculation increases the serum prostate-specific antigen concentration.&quot; (Tchetgen MB, Urology. 1996)
**Conclusion: Ejaculation causes a significant increase in the serum PSA concentration in men between 49 and 79 years of age that may persist for up to 48 hours. This change appears to correlate with age and baseline PSA. It is recommended that men abstain from ejaculation for 48 hours prior to having a serum PSA determination.
*'''1995''' PMID 7544734 -- &quot;Effect of ejaculation on prostate-specific antigen levels in normal men.&quot; (Kirkali Z, Eur Urol. 1995)
**Conclusion: Ejaculation does not seem to affect the serum PSA concentration at 5 consecutive days after ejaculation.
*'''1993''' PMID 7684542 -- &quot;Effect of digital rectal examination (and ejaculation) on serum prostate-specific antigen after twenty-four hours. A randomized, prospective study.&quot; (McAleer JK, Urology. 1993)
**Conclusion: DRE had no clinically important effect on PSA values twenty-four hours later. Ejaculation had no meaningful effect on the serum PSA values.
*'''1992''' PMID 1384015 -- &quot;Prostate-specific antigen: establishment of the reference range for the clinically normal prostate gland and the effect of digital rectal examination, ejaculation, and time on serum concentrations.&quot; (Glenski WJ, Prostate. 1992)
**Conclusion: Digital rectal examination and ejaculation have no significant effect on the serum concentration.



==Percent-Free PSA==
*'''Multicenter, 1998''' - PMID 9605898 &amp;mdash; &quot;Use of the percentage of free prostate-specific antigen to enhance differentiation of prostate cancer from benign prostatic disease: a prospective multicenter clinical trial.&quot; Catalona WJ et al. JAMA. 1998 May 20;279(19):1542-7.
**Prospective. 773 men with PSA 4-10, ages 50-75, no palpable disease, histologically proven prostate cancer or benign disease. 
**Lower free PSA associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer. Using 25% free PSA cutoff lead to 95% sensitivity and avoided 20% of unnecessary biopsies. 


==PSA Failure==
=== PSA Nadir (PSAn) Post Radiotherapy===
In postradiotherapy patients PSA may never reach completely undetectable levels and rather will reach a very low nadir, typically below 1.0 ng/mL within 2 years after therapy. (0.2 ng/mL within 5 years in patients treated with simultaneous irradiation with a transperineal prostate iodine implant, followed by external beam irradiation)
Of particular interest is the correlation of PSA nadir levels to outcomes among RT patients.

*PMID 12946753 - '''DWitt KD et al'''. &quot;What does postradiotherapy PSA nadir tell us about freedom from PSA failure and progression-free survival in patients with low and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer?&quot; Urology. 2003 Sep;62(3):492-6.
**Patients were categorized by nPSA quartile groups with cutpoints of less than 0.3, 0.3 to less than 0.6, 0.6 to less than 1.2, and 1.2 ng/mL or greater.Freedom from PSA failure was strongly associated with nadir quartile groups (P &lt;0.0001). PFS was also significantly different statistically among nadir quartile groups (P = 0.02). No statistically significant difference was found in overall survival associated with nPSA at this point. CONCLUSIONS: nPSA is a strong independent predictor of freedom from PSA failure and PFS in patients with low and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer treated with RT alone. Longer follow-up and larger patient numbers are required to confirm these observations.
*PMID 12441934 - &quot;Time to achieve a prostate specific antigen nadir of 0.2 ng./ml. after simultaneous irradiation for prostate cancer.&quot; '''Critz FA ''' J Urol. 2002 Dec;168(6):2434-8.
**With rare exceptions to be potentially cured of prostate cancer by simultaneous irradiation men must achieve a PSA nadir of 0.2 ng./ml. within 5 years of implantation. Failure to reach this goal by 60 months of followup almost always indicates persistent disease.&quot;

Critz and colleagues found that a PSA nadir &lt; 0.2 ng/mL defines disease freedom following brachytherapy plus EBRT, and that a PSA nadir &gt; 1.0 ng/mL predicts for disease recurrence at a median of 5 years of follow-up. In addition, data from DeWitt and colleagues demonstrate that a PSA nadir &gt; 1.2 predicts worse outcomes in measures of freedom from PSA failure and progression-free survival in patients undergoing EBRT at the same time point.

===Definition of PSA Failure Post-Radiation therapy ===
*'''ASTRO Consensus Statement'''
**'''Phoenix Definition; 2006''' PMID 16798415 &amp;mdash; &quot;Defining biochemical failure following radiotherapy with or without hormonal therapy in men with clinically localized prostate cancer: Recommendations of the RTOG-ASTRO Phoenix Consensus Conference.&quot; Roach M 3rd et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Jul 15;65(4):965-74.
***1. Biochemical failure is defined as a rise of 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir after EBRT w/ or w/o hormonal therapy.
***2. The date of failure should be &quot;at call&quot; (not backdated).
**'''Original; 1997''' PMID 9169810 (No abstract). &quot;Consensus statement: Guidelines for PSA following radiation therapy&quot; Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1997 Mar 15;37(5):1035-41.
***1. Biochemical failure is not justification per se to initiate additional treatment. It is not equivalent to clinical failure.  It is, however, an appropriate early end point for clinical trials
***2. Three consecutive increases in PSA is a reasonable definition of biochemical failure after radiotherapy. For clinical trials, the date of failure should be the midpoint between the postirradiation nadir PSA and the first of the three consecutive rises
***3. No definition of PSA failure has, as yet, been shown to be a surrogate for clinical progression or survival
***4. Nadir PSA is a strong prognostic factor, but no absolute level is a valid cutpoint for separating successful and unsuccessful treatments. The nadir PSA is similar in prognostic value to pretreatment prognostic variables


*'''Vancouver rules (1999)''' - 1) True nadir is the lowest post-therapy PSA value. The reference nadir is the lowest reading which is not followed by a subsequent fall. 2) Must be 2 consecutive rises above the reference nadir, at least 1 month apart. 3) PSA &gt; 1.5 is required at any time after the reference nadir before PSA relapse can be scored. 4) Date of failure is midpoint between reference nadir and first post-true-nadir reading. 5) If true nadir is &gt;=4, relapse is scored at that time and no further rises are needed. 6) Salvage therapy is considered a relapse.

*'''Mass General''' - &quot;Strict definition&quot;: after a nadir of &lt;1 which occurs in 1 year, failure occurs if there are 2 consecutive rises. Failure is scored at the first increase. &quot;Liberal definition&quot;: same as strict, but nadir only needs to be &lt;4. 
**PMID 7751173

*'''MDACC''' - 2 consecutive rises above nadir. Failure if increase by &gt;1 or by a factor of 1.5.
**PMID 7533459

**Houston definition has improved predictive ability compared to ASTRO and Vancouver defs. Moreover, it does not violate the Cox propoprtional hazards test for patients treated both with and without androgen suppression.

====Comparison of PSA failure definitions====
*PMID 15711272 -- '''Definitions of biochemical failure that best predict clinical failure in patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiation alone: a multi-institutional pooled analysis.''' (Horwitz EM,  J Urol. 2005)
**Pooled data on 4,839 patients with T1-2 prostate cancer treated with EBRT alone at 9 institutions
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Defining BF as PSA greater than absolute nadir plus 2 ng/ml, dated at the call, PSA greater than current nadir plus 3 ng/ml, dated at the call, or 2 consecutive increases of at least 0.5 ng/ml, back dated, had higher sensitivity and specificity for DF alone or CF compared with the ASTRO definition.&quot;

*'''Taylor (Michigan)''' - [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11483331 Abstract] &amp;mdash; &quot;Definitions of biochemical failure in prostate cancer following radiation therapy.&quot; Taylor JMG et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Aug 1;50(5):1212-9.
**Single institution, 688 pts, 1987-96, all T stages, N0.  Evaluated 10 definitions of biochemical failure.  
**Favor Fox Chase Cancer Center method over ASTRO definition.

*'''Thames et al''' - [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14575823 Abstract] &amp;mdash; &quot;Comparison of alternative biochemical failure definitions based on clinical outcome in 4839 prostate cancer patients treated by external beam radiotherapy between 1986 and 1995.&quot; Thames H et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Nov 15;57(4):929-43.
**Used same pooled data set as [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14575822  Kuban et al, 2003] with 4839 pts and median f/u 6 years. Assessed 102 definitions of biochemical failure.
**Favors ASTRO definition but recognizes its bias from the backdating of PSA failures.

==== PSA failure after RT + hormonal therapy ====
These methods account for the expected rise in PSA after coming off hormonal therapy.

*'''Fox Chase modification of ASTRO definition (2005)''' - Uses the original ASTRO definition, with the following modifications: 1) If after an initial rise there is a decline in PSA, 2 further consecutive rises in PSA &gt;0.1 are required for a failure. 2) If the PSA after 3 consecutive rises was unchanged but then declined, 2 further consecutive rises were also required. 
**PMID 15817330 - &quot;Biochemical failure and the temporal kinetics of prostate-specific antigen after radiation therapy with androgen deprivation.&quot; Buyyounouski MK et al.  Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Apr 1;61(5):1291-8.

*'''EORTC (Bolla)''' - used PSA &gt; 1.5 and 2 consecutive rises separated by &gt;= 3 months (from PMID 12126818, 2002)

Comparisons:
*'''Fox Chase''', 2005 (1991-98) - PMID 16169682 - &quot;Defining biochemical failure after radiotherapy with and without androgen deprivation for prostate cancer.&quot; Buyyounouski MK et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Dec 1;63(5):1455-62.
**Purpose: Compare 3 definitions of biochemical failure in pts treated with or without AD: ASTRO, modified ASTRO, and nadir plus 2 (Houston definition). 
**Used same patient set as the other 2005 Fox Chase paper (see below). 
**Conclusion: Nadir + 2 (Houston definition) is superior to the ASTRO and modified ASTRO definitions in predicting true failures.

===Definition of PSA Failure Post-Radical Prostatectomy ===

Therapeutic goal of Radical prostatectomy is removal of prostatic and neoplastic tissue, so post-RP PSA level is undetectable, that is under 0.2 ng/ml (evaluated 30-45 days after surgery). Standard practice is to '''define post-RP biochemical failure as a PSA level exceeding 0.2 ng/mL on at least two successive evaluations''' ''or'' exceeding '''0.4 ng/mL on a single evaluation.''' By contrast, patients who never achieve undetectable levels '''and/or''' whose PSA rises very rapidly following surgery likely have metastatic disease.
* PMID 10799151 - &quot;Prostate specific antigen only progression of prostate cancer.&quot; J Urol 2000 Jun;163(6):1632-42 Moul JW

The use of very low PSA thresholds risks overtreating patients whose PSA level is detectable due to residual benign prostatic tissue. For example, one recent report demonstrated that a single PSA elevation of less
than 0.4 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy is associated with subsequent stable, nonprogressing disease in up to 50% of patients.
* PMID 11257657 - &quot;Defining prostate specific antigen progression after radical prostatectomy: what is the most appropriate cut point?&quot; Amling et  al. J Urol. 2001 Apr;165(4):1146-51.

*'''2006; Johns Hopkins''' (1985-2004) PMID 16921049 -- &quot;Defining biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy: a proposal for a standardized definition.&quot; (Stephenson AJ, J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 20;24(24):3973-8.)
**Conclusion: &quot;BCR defined as a PSA value of at least 0.4 ng/mL followed by another increase best explains the development of distant metastasis among 10 candidate definitions, after controlling for clinical variables and the use of secondary therapy. On the basis of this evidence, we propose that this definition be adopted as the standard for reporting the outcome of RP.&quot;

==PSA kinetics==
===Post-treatment PSA Bounce===
*PMID 15936550 -- '''PSA bounces after neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and external beam radiation: Impact on definitions of failure.''' (Zietman AL, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;A substantial proportion of patients treated by EBRT with neoadjuvant deprivation experienced a PSA bounce. A large percentage of these bounces scored as biochemical failure according to the ASTRO definition. The Nadir-plus-three definition is less vulnerable to this bias.&quot;
*PMID 12377320 -- '''Using the magnitude of PSA bounce after MRI-guided prostate brachytherapy to distinguish recurrence, benign precipitating factors, and idiopathic bounce.''' (Das P, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002)
**Results: +0.6ng/ml idiopathic bounce vs. +1.2ng/ml for ejaculation (p=0.003), instrumentation (p=0.007), proctitis (p&lt;0.0001) and biopsy-proven local recurrence (p=0.006)
**&lt;u&gt;Conclusion&lt;/u&gt;:&quot;In patients treated with MRI-guided prostate brachytherapy, recent ejaculation, instrumentation, or ongoing radiation proctitis can cause a transient increase in PSA, the magnitude of which is significantly higher than that for idiopathic PSA bounce, but is similar to that in patients with recurrent disease.&quot;

===After hormonal therapy + RT===
*'''Fox Chase''', 2005 (1991-98) - PMID 15817330 - &quot;Biochemical failure and the temporal kinetics of prostate-specific antigen after radiation therapy with androgen deprivation.&quot; Buyyounouski MK et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Apr 1;61(5):1291-8.
**Purpose: 1) describe the PSA kinetics after RT alone, RT + short term androgen deprivation (STAD, 3-12 months), and RT + long-term AD (LTAD, 1-3 yrs). 2) show the potential rise of PSA after withdrawal of AD. 3) Test the ASTRO definition in this setting. This paper provides a graphic representation of PSA kinetics.
**Retrospecitive. 688 men with localized prostate cancer treated with 3D-CRT, without AD or with STAD (82) or LTAD (20).  Minimum of 4 yrs f/u. Mean dose 74 Gy (ICRU dose). Biochemical failure used ASTRO definion as well as modified ASTRO definition (see section above). PSA obtained q6months.
**Median f/u 5-6 years. For those without biochemical failure, the PSA after STAD remains relatively constant, and after LTAD, PSA rises steadily towards 1. Between 22% and 29% of pts who had a failure by the ASTRO criteria subsequently had a fall in the PSA and were not classified as BF by the revised definition.

==Surrogate Endpoints==
*'''Post-treatment PSA-DT'''
**[http://www.asco.org/ac/1,1003,_12-002643-00_18-0034-00_19-0032291,00.asp ASCO Abstract]. Surrogate Endpoint for Prostate Cancer-specific Survival: Validation from an Analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 92-02. Valicenti et al.
***&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;Post-treatment PSA-DT &lt;12 months met all of Prentice’s criteria for surrogacy. For the first time, this was accomplished for a prospectively studied patient population, and justifies strong consideration for PSA-DT&lt; 12 months as a surrogate endpoint for prostate cancer mortality.

*PMID 13130113 [http://jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/jnci;95/18/1376.pdf Full text] - &quot;Surrogate End Point for Prostate Cancer–Specific Mortality After Radical Prostatectomy or Radiation Therapy.&quot; D'Amico et al Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 95, No. 18, 1376-1383, September 17, 2003
** A post-treatment PSA-DT of less than 3 months and the specific value of the post-treatment PSA-DT when it is 3 months or more appear to be surrogate end points for prostate cancer-specific mortality after surgery or radiation therapy.

      <comment>/* Conjunctive/Subjuntivo (Sub.jun.ti.vo) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==The three conjugations==
The verbs in portuguese have three conjugations:

The first (-ar), the second (- er*) and the third (-ir).

The conjugation suffix is ever the tonic syllable.

&lt;small&gt;*The verb pôr is the revised form of the extincted poer.&lt;/small&gt;
==Moods==
===Indicativ/Indicativo ''(In.di.ca.t''i''.vo)''===
A fact.

'''I walk.'''
:''Eu ando.''

The subject certainly walks.
===Conjunctive/Subjuntivo ''(Sub.jun.t''i''.vo)''===
It is uncertain.

'''If I walk...'''
:''Se eu andar...''

The &quot;if&quot; shows uncertainly.

'''I hoped to walk.'''
:''Eu esperava andar.''

It's a wish, so, it isn't certainly.

'''When I want, I will walk.'''
:''Quando eu quiser, eu vou andar.'' or (''Quando eu quiser, eu irei andar.'' or ''Quando eu quiser, eu andarei.'')

It' s more complicated to explain. When it has a [[relative pronoun]], that is generally used to ask an explanation to the doubt of the first person, the conjunctive comes.

'''Maybe I walk...'''
:''Talvez eu ande...''

'''Maybe I wlll walk.'''
:''Talvez eu vá andar.'' or (''Talvez eu irei andar.'' or ''Talvez eu andarei.'')

The &quot;will&quot; puts the action into the future.

'''He doesn't know if he will walk or no.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Book descriptions ==

There used to be a list of book descriptions here. Perhaps this isn't the place for the list but I thought it was a useful thing, as it clarified the difference between the books. Since many books here overlap significantly, it's my view that it is good to have a clear overall structure. For example where does detailed information on MOSFET channel-width modulation go? ''Semiconductors'' or ''Electronics'' or ''Materials in Electronics''? New editors and readers (and old editors who don't know about new books, etc) may not be able to easily navigate without a clear guide. Maybe a subpage would be in order?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Indicative (In.di.ca.t''i''.vo)==
===Present===
-o/-as (1), -es (2, 3)/-a (1), -e (2, 3)

-amos (1), -emos (2), -imos (3)/-ais (1), eis (2), is (3)/ -am (1), -em (2, 3)

It doesn' t matter the irregularity of the verb. In this tense, increasing the &quot;-s&quot; or &quot;-es&quot; (consonant-ending) in the third person of the singular, it comes to the second.

To put an obliqual pronoun, put a hiphen (-) following the verb and the pronoun.

When it's in the third person, see the rules.

You can put a normal &quot;-lhe&quot; in the normal rule, unclearing gender.

When it ends with r, s or z, exclude the final letter and use the rule with the pronouns &quot;-lo (s)&quot; and &quot;-la (s)&quot;.

Do the same thing with words ending in &quot;m&quot;, &quot;õe&quot;, &quot;ões&quot; (excluding the &quot;s&quot;) and &quot;ão&quot;.
===Future of the present===
Increase '''ever''' it in the infinitive end:

-ei/-ás/-á/-emos/-eis/-ão

Sometimes the infinitive isn' t used and it' s substituted, something rare.

Trazer (bring) by &quot;traz&quot;, dizer (say) by &quot;diz&quot; (contradizer = contradiz, desdizer = desdiz, ...) and fazer (do with the mode of make) by &quot;faz&quot; (desfazer = desfaz, satisfazer = satisfaz).

The obliqual form is...

(verb without suffix) + (-) (me, te, lhe, nos, vos, lhes) + (-) + (suffix)

Dar-te-ei = I will give you

Trazer-vos-emos = We will bring ... to You.

===Future of the past===
The obliqual form, the formation and irregularity are the same of the future of the present, but the suffix isn' t.

-ia/-ias/-á/-íamos/-íeis/-iam

It shows what was going to happening in the past.

'''After he had breakfast yesterday, he walked.'''
:'' Depois de tomar café ontem, ele andou.''

'''We would know what really happened after reading that message.'''
:''Saberíamos o que realmente aconteceu após lermos aquela mensagem.''

====Composted form====
(Iria, irias, iria, iríamos, iríeis, iriam) + Infinitive 

===More-than-perfect past===
It is the past of the past.

'''The murderer had already killed his mother.'''
:(''O assassino já teria matado sua mãe.'') or ''O assassino matara sua mãe.''

Increase this particles to the conditional future:

-a, -as, -a, -amos, -eis, -am

The obliqual form is separated ever.

'''I had given to him.'''
:''Eu lhe dera.'' or ''Eu dera-lhe.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Aland =

&lt;font size=3&gt;* Meter stamps inscribed ALAND first came into use in 1984. Starting in 1952 meters of Finland were used in Aland. For issues before 1984, see FINLAND. The Finnish stamps used in Aland prior to 1984 are detailed in the stamp catalog ''ÅLAND-Spezial 2001/2002'' (in German) by Robert Fillips. An extract is available on the web.
* The stamps are grouped according to appearance and function:
:: A - Frank with three post horns across top
:: B - Frank with Aland postal service logo in multiple corners
:: PO - Special post office machine stamps
&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added the emmentaller cheese item.

I am living in Stuttgart Germany, eat Flammkuchen about once a week, and every one I've ever been served in Germany or in France (Strasbourg) is served with cheese on top.

I would lose the yeast in this recipe, or at least cut right down. Flammkuchen should be thin and crispy. Also swap bacon for Schwarzwaldschinken / black-forest ham.

:I've never seen a recipe with cheese on it. Can you supply a citation? [[Special:Contributions/69.244.60.90|69.244.60.90]] ([[User talk:69.244.60.90|talk]]) 19:53, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
:: As an Alsacian, I can attest too. Emmental cheese is optionnal, then the dish is called ''tarte flambée gratinée''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Who &quot;owns&quot; the goal?==
In basketball, the goal a player tries to put the ball into is the opponents.  When a person has the ball and is attempting to make a goal, he is playing offence, and the opponent is playing defence.  What is the defender defending, his goal or his opponents?  The terminology only makes sense if he is defending his own goal. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 23:33, 7 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

When I told the original contributor to this book that I couldn't find it on Wikipedia, it was an implication that original research is not within Wikibooks' scope and that I was hoping to see references to prove otherwise.  Now I see the same contributor created the page at Wikipedia [[w:Tchiroe]] today.  Note the VFD discussion there at [[w:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Tchiroe]].  The Wikipedians are in agreement that this language is original research.  I would suggest that the original contributor add this book to [[v:Wikiversity]] instead.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:49, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

I don't mind if you delte both, i am fine with moving to wikiversity. Can you at least give me a day or two to move it over?

This is currently unused and does little to increase the visibility of a proposal beyond {{tl|proposed}}. Community attention needs to be sought by better means. While strawpolls are useful tools, we don't vote on policies. They are discussed and pass/fail by consensus. [[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:38, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' The intent was for this template to compliment [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines/Vote]] by making it clear when a proposal has gone from the drafted state to building consensus for adoption state. I think such a distinction is useful to have, maybe the template name, category and wording need to change though. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:42, 17 February 2009 (UTC)
:: Since building consensus usually involves modifying the proposal, that transition isn't really useful. Has there perhaps been a problem with policies being drastically altered during strawpolls? I remember things going fairly smoothly with the PAG-of-the-month we had a few years ago. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 15:38, 17 February 2009 (UTC)
:::Being altered drastically during the consensus-building phase is not a problem. The whole point is that as disagreements arise, the proposal is changed to address those through compromise. However, focusing on the template itself: [[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''We don't need this.''' &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:37, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
::: Think of it like this than as a clarification: When a proposal is first being drafted people are working to make it a good proposal and edit the proposal boldly, there might even be at some point consensus among the people working on the proposal that the proposal is good as is, without there being community consensus to adopt it as a policy or guideline. So the community is alerted, and further discussion is initiated to try to build consensus to adopt the proposal as a policy or guideline. Further changes may be necessary, but those changes should reflect consensus because drastic changes at that point might void other people's previous support for the proposal. This template (whatever it is to be called) alerts the community that people are done drafting the proposal and are ready for the community to discuss its adoption as a policy or guideline, and that any further changes should reflect consensus. IOWs there are usually two consensus building phases involved, and this template lets people know that the proposal is no longer actively being drafted but rather being discussed for adoption. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:00, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
:::: As Mike stated above; drastic changes during consensus building aren't a problem. Any change, whether drastic or not, should, furthermore, aim for consensus. {{tlx|Proposed}} already directs Wikibookians to discuss changes on the talk page.
:::: In practice the PAGotM team drafted proposals which were then brought to the community for discussion. This was by necessity, and not the ideal, to work through the long back-log of proposals. The community was kept well informed and we never had any major problems. Think of it like a gesture to the ideal that the community be involved throughout the process. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:01, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

::::: Maybe in an ideal world the community would be kept well informed and would be involved throughout the process, but the ideal world isn't the one we live in. To keep the community well informed, involved throughout the process and keep from having a backlog of proposals something has to change. I think for the most part the community is only interested once they feel the proposal in stable or done being drafted so that all they need to do is say &quot;yes this should be adopted and here's why&quot; or &quot;no this should be rejected and here's why&quot;, at least that would be my impression over the past 5 years. So this template tries to adopt to what the community seems to want, rather than some ideal, by having a means of telling the difference between a draft people are still working on and a stable proposal that is basically ready for the community to discuss. In any case I've reworded the template to remove the issue with voting. Also by having a separate category for drafts and for stable proposals, DynamicPageList or CategoryTree can be used to list more prominently proposals ready for community feedback. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:48, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

:::::: I'm not sure where you're going with pointing out that we don't live in an ideal world. I don't think anyone here is suffering from such illusions. An example of the contrary, my previous comment gives an alternative approach to the practical realities. For those interested in commenting on proposals, but not in being actively involved in the drafting, the well-advertised straw-polls we've used in the past have worked well. Again, this template does little to increase visibility or restrict modification of the proposal.
:::::: Well, not currently. I like your changes to the template, but separate categories or dynamic listing do little for visibility unless pages show up on the watchlists of potentially interested users (the reading rooms are useful to  are an option) or feature somehow in the interface (such as on [[MediaWiki:Sitenotice]]. See [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/General#Top-of-the-page_notices|relevant discussion]] in the general reading room). Do you have a particular implementation in mind? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:44, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

::::::: Well your comment suggested to me that there is some illusion that by discouraging this template the ideal of having community involvement throughout the process can somehow be maintained. Also both Mike and you seem to be urging that changes should reflect consensus and that drastic changes are not a problem, while I am saying drastic changes should reflect consensus when the community is being asked to review the proposal and boldly making drastic changes without discussion or consensus during the review process should not be done, but until than people can boldly make changes to the proposal unless there is a disagreement while the proposal is being drafted. Put another way drafting a proposal is a low impact decision, but the decision to adopt a proposal is a high impact decision that requires more discretion and more community involvement. I don't exactly see a disagreement there, unless Mike or you are urging that making drastic changes without consensus, when the community is being asked to build consensus or do a straw-poll, is fine? Basically along with my change to {{tlx|vote}}, some changes should be made to {{tlx|proposed}} to say instead &quot;this is a draft, feel free to change it&quot;. You still seem to not understand when this template would be used. {{tlx|vote}} (possibly rename to review?) would be used when the community is asked to review the proposal and when a straw-poll is initiated to determine whether the proposal should be adopted or not.
::::::: Well at first I think the dynamic list would be included in a template that people can place on their user page, and from there it might be added to other pages, which is similar to how {{tlx|new}} was rejuvenated. This template could be included right under the list of new books on [[WB:CHAT|general reading room]] and within a section of [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:16, 17 March 2009 (UTC)
::::::::I just don't see why you need any explicit &quot;review&quot; step - proposals, adopted policies and accepted guidelines are (or should be) constantly undergoing review and revision such that they constantly reflect community consensus, which may change from time to time. However, going down that road is really a discussion about how the community works, and nothing about this template. I just don't see how this template is at all useful to the project. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:31, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

(reset)

Wikibooks already in essence has an explicit review part. The review part is when the community is asked to decide whether a proposal should be adopted or not. There is nothing new to that. Its not like Wikibookians writes proposals and there automatically adopted and enforced as a policy or guideline without discussion first. I think its making a big deal out of something rather small, and I just don't get what the issue is. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:44, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

This template can be useful in the same was as {{tlx|new book}} is for new books. Using {{tlx|new book}} ensures new books are listed on {{tlx|new}}, which in turn ensures more visibility for new books. {{tlx|vote}} could be used to ensure more visibility for proposals in a similar way. How is that not useful? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:52, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

This discussion has been up since February. Let's move it along one way or another. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:53, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:: It was being used until it was proposed for deletion. {{tlx|proposed}} doesn't do the same thing because its slapped on any proposal, while {{tlx|vote}} would indicate a proposal ready to be discussed and made a policy or guideline if the community agrees with it. Not all proposals are ready to be discussed and made a policy or guideline at the time it is proposed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:04, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:::That's really odd. I would think that something that is proposed would be fair game for discussion from the moment it's created. That's pretty much what comes to mind when I hear &quot;proposal&quot;. If a proposal isn't really a proposal, I'd suggest coming up with different terminology. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:17, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:::: Most people don't bother to discuss a proposed policy or guideline until after some announcement is made. Any discussion that does take place is often informal (like &quot;this is a good idea&quot;) and not reflective of whether people feel the proposal should be adopted or is ready to be adopted (like &quot;this proposal has some issues that need to be worked out before I can support its adoption. I think ____ needs to be changed&quot;). Just like people often aren't very descriptive of their reasons when marking a page for speedy deletion but tend to have more to say if the page is discussed here first. I think people don't see proposals with {{tlx|proposed}} as indication that its time decide to adopt it as a policy or guideline. I think people see proposals with {{tlx|proposed}} as being drafts and not stable/finished works (Yes I know a policy or guideline is never finished technically, but people like something they can point to that isn't going to change to something that they wouldn't agree with when discussing and agreeing to adopt a proposal). --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:42, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

:(outdent)
:I see the merit of two separate phases (hence, two separate templates), but I too have found the terminology misleading:  the word &quot;proposed&quot; suggests to me that someone has formally put forward that &quot;we should do it this way&quot; &amp;mdash; a much more advanced stage of development than the informal &quot;draft&quot;.  This is '''not''' a problem with&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:Vote&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; at all, but rather with the terminology surrounding&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:Proposed&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  I suggest that we
:* rename&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:Proposed&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:Draft&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.
:* modify the message on&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:Draft&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; by changing the words &quot;proposed draft&quot; in the first sentence to &quot;draft proposal&quot;, so it reads &quot;This page contains a draft proposal for a Wikibooks policy or guideline.&quot;  That's &quot;draft proposal&quot; versus &quot;stable proposal&quot;, which is the wording used in&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:Vote&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.
:* rename&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:Wikibooks proposed policies and guidelines&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp; to&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:Wikibooks draft policies and guidelines&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;.  (This might not be the best possible choice of name, but I think it would suffice; perhaps someone else can think of a superior alternative?)
:There would be no change at all to&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Template:Vote&lt;/code&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;. --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:03, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

::I like Pi zero's ideas was bold in implementing them, since the changes were not regarding the template up for deletion specifically.  Unfortunately this doesn't answer the larger question here. As Pi zero states above, two templates imply two separate phases. I'd say if the community wants two phases, there should be two templates. If not, then just the one.  Hopefully this would be more clear-cut than a certain other issue that has yet to reach consensus. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:31, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

::: Well, my creation of the vote template was an attempt to be bold to begin with. If a change in terminology helps I'm for it. I didn't particularly see a problem with old terminology as I think {{tlx|proposed}} already indicated that a page was draft for a proposal. {{tlx|vote}} was intended as a way to highlight those pages that people felt were at a point that an announcement should be made to try to garner consensus as required by [[Wikibooks:Decision making#High impact decisions]]. Proposals aren't adopted as a policy or guideline on the spot when people stop working on a proposal, first consensus has to be reached before it becomes one. I wasn't trying to change any process, but rather make the process a bit more obvious and provide an easy way to list policy and guideline proposals that people feel are important to get community consensus on. Such proposals are often announced in the reading room and in the site notice, this just provides another way to highlight them and for people to find them. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:53, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

We shouldn't be assuming someone wants to license something under the GFDL anymore. It is a legal grey area, and although some say that there was a binding statement saying that at one point, ''all'' uploads were considered to be under the GFDL, things have changed. It has also been recently deprecated on the English Wikipedia, and is also not an acceptable license on Commons either. The deletion of this would require a more drawn out process though, sorting through the 500 images that still use it.

::To deprecate it, we first made it so that GFDL-presumed after a specific date was not a proper license. Then we made a campaign to alert users who have uploaded images marked under the license that we just assumed it was GFDL due to how it was and if you really want it to be GFDL, switch the tag to {{tl|GFDL}} or it will be soon deleted.

: '''Comment'''. As a quick note, GFDL-Presumed is not acceptable for new uploads. There was a cutoff we implemented, although I am not sure what the date was exactly. Also keep in mind that these are 500-some images that are being used, and where possible we should look for suitable replacement images instead of just deleting them outright. What I don't want to see happen is for books to lose some quality images that were licensed properly but weren't marked properly. We have attempted to contact all the creators of these images in the past, and the images that are still GFDL-presumed are from those authors that we could not contact. So, I don't recommend that we waste time on another round of emails. I'm in favor of removing GFDL-presumed, but I would like a sincere effort to be made to replace images instead of just deleting them. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 16:33, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I would think some of these images can't even be GFDL because they're already licensed (snapshots of Microsoft software) or can't be licensed (a picture demonstrating a right angle).

Presumption of GFDL is wrong.  Period.  There's a reason it's not being used anymore.  500 images isn't much to go through.

: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Empty stub consistently of only headings. A 2008 class project that never got off the ground. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:20, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

:: I had nominated a book in the past for speedy deletion on the grounds of being an old class project, but you had refactored it to remove references to the class project.  I had made edits to the book referenced by this nomination before it was nominated in the same line, to remove references to the project, categorize it so it would be seen, and set it up for contributions from anyone.  I'm not opposed to deletion, but I would like to see more consistency in what is grounds for deletion. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:09, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

::: In this case I think there is no meaningful content and no work would be lost by its deletion. I think anyone who wants to do an [[WB:AT|annotation]] of the book could easily recreate the headings if they wanted to use a similar structure. I think the page is more likely to discourage rather then encourage contributions because of the nature of the intended work, its narrow focus, and there is nothing really to work with. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:41, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

: {{comment}} This is very similar to [[Frankenstein]] being voted on above, it consists simply of an outline of sections the authors wished existed.  I am not sure if Frankenstein started out as a class project.  This book raises the question again should long term stub-ness be grounds for deletion. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:52, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

::[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' I think the larger question is what the definition of a stub is. To me a stub would be a page/book with limited content, but content nonetheless. Speedy deletion is possible for &quot;no meaningful content&quot;. Are headings meaningful content, or not?  There's also the problem that there are so many stubs on Wikibooks in the first place. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:09, 19 July 2009 (UTC)

::: [[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''  Tentatively, at least as a sufficient (if perhaps not necessary) criterion, how about this:
:::: If the page/book is abandoned and would not save conceptual effort for someone considering adopting it rather than starting from scratch, then there is no meaningful content.
::: I specify ''conceptual'' effort because purely mechanical overhead like page creation shouldn't count; when technical overhead becomes sophisticated enough it crosses over from &quot;pure mechanics&quot; to conceptual organization, and would then count as meaningful content.  The criterion may be too subjective to use safely in most cases for true speedy deletion (i.e., without discussion), but at least it provides a framework for deliberation.  In my judgment, [[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]] fails this criterion, so
::: [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' it.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:46, 19 July 2009 (UTC)
::::{{comment}} Unlike Frankenstein, this page is not an outline of a book, but rather a empty Wikipedia article. I've seen articles on Wikipedia with blank sections. So, in my opinion as a newbie here, I think it's either delete or transwiki (although I suppose there is already such an article on Wikipedia, so ''delete'' is the most likely.) [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] ([[User talk:Kayau|talk]]) 11:01, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Six headings detailing the portions of a novel that would necessarily be part of any analysis anyone would create don't stand out to me as being worth keeping or transwikiing.-- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:09, 4 August 2009 (UTC)

{{new honor warning|2009}}

;Note:  Unlike many AY Honors, this honor does not have “knowledge” requirements categorized separately from action requirements.  Rather, the requirements for honor completion are listed categorically.
==Instructor required==

Seed sowing is an activity that opens the way for evangelism.  It is somewhat secular in nature, and thus non-threatening to people who are anti-religion.  People who would not normally attend an evangelistic program may well attend one of these activities.  If successful, a seed-sowing activity leaves a positive impression about the church on the participants and establishes a level of trust.
===b. Name 5 examples of “seed sowing”===
*Depression Seminar
*Personal Finance Seminar
*Computer classes
*Healthy Lifestyle Management classes
*Auto Mechanic class
*Child care

===c. Participate in at least one “seed sowing” event===

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{diet}}

The Paleolithic ('Paleo' for short) diet is based around the premise that the human body is healthiest eating the same sort of pre-agricultural, hunter-gatherer-style diet that was eaten for most of human evolution. There is no widely accepted scientific evidence to support this premise.

Modern 'paleo' diets generally make concessions to the modern environment rather than being a strict recreation of a particular pre-historical diet, but embrace the same principles.

A paleo diet focuses around lean meat (ideally game meat), vegetables and fruit and a small amount of nuts and seeds.  Specifically excluded from the diet are dairy, grains, sugar, salt and (of course) highly processed modern food products such as cheese puffs.

The Paleo diet shares some characteristics of low-carb/high-protein diets such as Atkins but is more focussed on what is imagined to be eating in a historically &quot;natural&quot; way.  It also contains lower levels of fat (and particularly saturated fat) than many low-carb diets.

: &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; - French occupation, “ALGERIE POSTES” or “POSTES ALGERIE”

      <comment>Reference to a.limback should have been a.bog1</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The difference between a scenery object and a moving wagon are basically two things.  

First we need to tell Trainz how long it is so it knows where to put the next wagon or loco, we also need to tell Trainz where the bogeys are so it can go round bends correctly.  Trainz uses specially named attachment points for this.  The front is marked by a.limfront the back by a.limback the first bogey is a.bog0 the second a.bog1.

The second is in the config.txt file.

The advantage of creating a moving house is you can use the existing house tutorials since much of the work is exactly the same.  We can soon change the shape of the house to more closely resemble a wagon or loco at a later date.

The first step is to add a.limfront:  &lt;Space&gt; add empty.  Note the properties tab, if you can't see it press &quot;N&quot;


[[Image:Trainz Moving house 1.jpg]]

After creation. 

[[Image:Trainz Moving house 2.jpg]]

Now change the name in the properties tab to a.limfront, the y location to -3 meters, the Z location to .89 meters.

[[Image:Trainz Moving house 3.jpg]]

&lt;shift&gt;D,&lt;esc&gt; clones a.limfront.  In the properties tab change the clone's name to a.limback.  Change the y location to 3 meters.

Clone again to create a.bog0, change the name, y=-2, z=0.  Repeat for a.bog1, change the name, y=2, z=0.

[[Image:Trainz Moving house 5.jpg]]

This image shows the outliner.  Select it on the left, if nothing is visible place the mouse in the window, &lt;Crtl&gt;&lt;up arrow&gt; to make it full screen, then &lt;Crtl&gt;&lt;down arrow&gt; to make it a window once more.  Note the selected item is highlighted in the outliner.  You can select items directly from the outliner and it has the advantage that the object will not be moved by a mouse movement.

Save the file and export it in the same way as you exported the original house.  I use body.xml to export a body.im file.

Download KUID: 86627:1792 from the DLS, this is the cylinder wagon used in the cylinder texture tutorial.  Clone it.  Open for edit in explorer.

Copy the body.im file together with the texture file &quot;terrace one.tga&quot; and &quot;terrace one.texture.txt&quot; into the cloned folder.  &quot;terrace one.texture.txt&quot; is a special file that is referenced in the body.im file and contains information about the texture file &quot;terrace one.texture.txt&quot; for Trainz.

Edit config.txt file in notepad and change the mesh to the new name.

mesh-table
{
  default
  {
    mesh                                &quot;body.im&quot;
    auto-create                         1
  }
}

We need to change the name to something different so for the moment add a 2 on the end in both name lines.

Save the changes.  Commit then go into Surveyor.  Look for cylinder wagon 2 and place a couple behind a loco.  Go into driver and drive off.

Congratulations you've created a wagon.

[[Image:Trainz moving house screenshot 0001.jpg]]


We can clean it up a bit.  Delete the cylinder.im files and cylinder texture files.  Make it a bit more wagon like by going back into Blender, first delete the roof.  Now adjust the properties tab to make the house 5 meters long in the y, .1 meter in the Z dimension and 2.3 meters in the x dimension.  We want to raise it above the track so set the Z location to 1 meter.  Change the location of a.limfront and a.limback to define the wagon's length.

[[Image:Moving house 6.jpg]]

The simplest bogey to use is the one already in the config.txt file that uses a.bog2 so clone a.bog0, rename it a.bog2 and locate it at z=.5 meters.

We want sides on our wagon so &lt;Shift&gt;D, &lt;esc&gt;, change the name to side1 change the z dimension to 1 meter, change the x dimension to .1 meter and displace it to one side so location X=1.1 meters, we need to raise it so location Z=1.5 meters.

[[Image:Trainz screenshot tutorial Moving house 7.jpg]]

Repeat for the other side and two ends.  You may need to adjust the size and location of the base, and sides.

Export your wagon.

By now we are getting closer to a real wagon.  Basically all you have to do now is get a better texture file with wagon like textures and adjust things like author's name etc. in the config.txt file.

The purpose of this honor is to illustrate how God has led within the Adventist church to share His message through the events, places, and contributions of the people of a specific cultural group.

==1. Who was William E. Foy and how did he become involved in the Millerite movement?==

A Millerite preacher, of interest to Seventh-day Adventists because his name is occasionally mentioned as one who in 1842 and 1844 had visions relating to the Adventist (Millerite) movement. He was described as a tall, light-skinned Black man, an eloquent speaker. He lived in New England and as a young man in 1835 gave his heart to Christ. Sometime thereafter he became a member of the Freewill Baptist Church. However, in 1842 he was preparing to take holy orders as an Episcopal minister. It was at this time that he had two visions relating to the near advent of Christ and to last-day events. Prior to this, while deeply religious, he had been, by his own testimony, “opposed to the doctrine of Jesus’ near approach,” but after the visions he joined the Millerites in heralding the message of the expectation of Christ’s coming.

The account of two initial visions of William Foy, together with a brief sketch of his Christian experience, was published in 1845 in pamphlet form in Portland, Maine. The first occurred Jan. 18, 1842, while he was attending a prayer service in Boston on Southark Street. According to eyewitnesses he was in vision two and a half hours. The pamphlet includes the statement of a physician who examined him during a vision and testified that he could find no appearance of life “except around the heart.” As Foy declared: “My breath left me.”

In the first vision, Foy saw the reward of the faithful and the punishment of sinners. Although he felt it his duty to tell what he had seen, he made the excuse that he had not been instructed to relate it. Finding no peace of mind, he had a description of the vision printed, but it was a “very imperfect sketch.” In a second vision, on Feb. 4, 1842, in which he saw multitudes of those who had not died and those who had been raised from the dead being assembled to receive their reward, he heard the instruction that he was to reveal what he had seen and to warn his fellow creatures to flee from the wrath to come.

Foy’s unwillingness to relate to others what he had seen stemmed not only from the prejudice of the Millerites against any who claimed to have divine revelations but also, he said, from “the prejudice among the people against those of my color.” He questioned in his mind, “Why should these things be given to me, to bear to the world?”

On Feb. 6, 1842, the pastor of the Bloomfield Street church in Boston called upon Foy to relate the visions in his house of worship. He consented reluctantly, and the next afternoon he faced a large congregation. As he began to speak, his fear left him, and he related with great freedom the things he had seen.

After this he traveled for three months delivering his messages to crowded houses of many denominations. When speaking, he wore the robes of the Episcopal clergy. As he graphically described the heavenly world, the New Jerusalem, and the compassionate love of Christ, and exhorted the unconverted to seek God, many responded to his entreaties. However, because his family needed support, Foy, after three months, retired from public work to labor with his hands. Three months later, feeling impelled to deliver his message, he again took up his public ministry, expecting soon to see his Saviour.

Ellen Harmon heard Foy speak in Beethoven Hall in her home city, Portland, Maine, when she was but a girl. According to J. N. Loughborough, Foy had a third vision near the time of the expectation in 1844 in which he saw three platforms, which he could not understand in the light of his belief in the imminent coming of Christ. In perplexity he ceased public work.

Some have questioned the genuineness of William Foy’s experience, but others have felt that the “visions bore clear evidence of being the genuine manifestations of the Spirit of God” (Loughborough, The Great Second Advent Movement, p.&amp;nbsp;146). Ellen White in a 1912 interview (EGW Document File 231) reported that she had talked with him once when he was present in a meeting in which she was relating her own early visions, and that he had said that her account was just what he had seen. She apparently regarded his experience as genuine.

The Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopedia. Review and Herald Publishing Association, 2002

 

William Ellis Foy, a Baptist training for the ministry in Boston, was an eloquent speaker with an impressive command of the language. He was arguably the most controversial of Black Millerite preachers because he received visions during the two years just preceding the Great Disappointment.

We know that Foy hesitated to relate what he had seen, as had others, including Ellen White. In addition to the ridicule that one would experience just for being a Millerite, he no doubt felt he would suffer additionally because of being a Black man during that time.

Information about Foy was scant or confusing until the book The Unknown Prophet was written by Delbert Baker. Now we know that he joined other Black preachers of that period in successfully communicating the Advent message to both Black and White audiences.&quot; His visions bore the stamp of divine origin.

 

William Foy's grave (spelled Foye on the tombstone) is located at the very back of the Birch Tree cemetery in East Sullivan, Maine. His stone reads:

Rev. William E. Foye
Died in Plantation No. 7
Nov. 9, 1893
Age 74 years

More Information

 

Info from www.WhiteEstate.org:

William E. Foy, a member of the Freewill Baptist Church, who was preparing for the ministry, was given two visions in Boston in 1842—one on January 18 and the other on February 4. In the first of these revelations, Foy viewed the glorious reward of the faithful and the punishment of sinners. Not being instructed to relate to others what was shown him, he told no one of his vision; but he had no peace of mind. In the second revelation he witnessed the multitudes of earth arraigned before heaven's bar of judgment; a “mighty angel” with silver trumpet in hand about to descend to earth by “three steps;” the books of record in heaven; the coming of Christ and the reward of the faithful. He was bidden, “Thou must reveal those things which thou hast seen, and also warn thy fellow creatures to flee from the wrath to come.”—The Christian Experience of Wm. E. Foy, Together With the Two Visions He Received (1845).

Two days after this revelation he was requested by the pastor of the Bloomfield Street church in Boston to relate the visions.
Although he was a fluent speaker, he reluctantly complied, fearing that the general prejudice against visions, and the fact that he was a mulatto, would make his work difficult. The “large congregation assembled” was spellbound, and with this initial encouragement, Foy traveled three months, delivering his message to “crowded houses.” Then to secure means to support his family, he left public work for a time, but, finding “no rest day nor night,” he took it up again. Ellen Harmon, when but a girl, heard him speak at Beethoven Hall in Portland, Maine. (Interview of D. E. Robinson with Mrs. E. G. White, 1912. White Publications, D.F. 231.)

Near the time of the expectation in 1844, according to J. N. Loughborough, Foy was given a third vision in which were presented three platforms, which he could not understand in the light of his belief in the imminent coming of Christ, and he ceased public work. (The Great Second Advent Movement, pages 146, 147.)

It so happened that a short time after this, Foy was present at a meeting in which Ellen Harmon related her first visions. She did not know that he was present until he interrupted with a shout, and exclaimed that it was just what he had seen. (D.F. 231.) Foy did not live long after this.

==2. Name two African American preachers of the Millerite Movement and learn how God used them to share His message.==
William Ellis Foy - He was a preacher in the Millerite movement, plus God called him to be a prophet, but knowing the prejudice against his race, he was afraid and God had to call someone else.
Charles Bowles - He was a Millerite preacher in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Vermont.

==3. Learn about 3 African American abolitionists who were influenced by the Advent movement.==
Sojourner Truth (1797-1883)

==9. Name the first African American Adventist College and how did it receive its name==
===a. When and where was it founded?===
Oakwood University was founded in 1896 as Oakwood Industrial School in Huntsville Alabama. Legend has it that the school was named for a stand of oak trees found on the campus.
The school first opened in 1896 with 16 students. Classes were offered in various trades and skills. In 1904, the name was changed to Oakwood Manual Training School, and it was chartered to grant degrees in 1907. In 1917, the school offered its first instruction at the postsecondary level, and in that same year it changed its name to Oakwood Junior College. In 1944, the name Oakwood College was adopted. The first bachelor’s degrees were awarded in 1945. Oakwood College received its initial accreditation from SACS in 1958, and in 2007, the college received approval to award graduate degrees. In response to this higher accreditation, the school's Board of Trustees and constituents voted to change the name of the institution again to Oakwood University of Seventh-day Adventists.

===b. Who located the site for the school?===

In 1896, a 360-acre plot in Huntsville, Alabama, came to the attention of the General Conference when Ellen G. White advised church leaders that God had revealed to her this was to be the spot for the school where African American Seventh-day Adventists would be educated and trained until the end of time.  An envoy of three men was sent to survey the land: O.A. Olsen, president of the General Conference; G.A. Irwin, director of the Southern District; and Harmon Lindsay, veteran church worker and former General Conference employee.  So the General Conference purchased the old Beasley Estate in 1896.  The place was called Oakwood because of the 65 oaks that towered on the property.

===c. What was the size of the property chosen?===

360 acres.  Additional land has been acquired since then.

==10. Who was Anna Knight?==
===a. Where and when was she born?===
Born in Gitano, Mississippi, on March 4, 1874, Knight early developed an iron will and steel resolve that would characterize her life.  

Anna Knight is one of the most influential individuals in the history of Oakwood.  Anna Knight was a fixture at Oakwood for nearly a half a century, beloved and respected, until her death on June 3, 1972.  Oakwood Elementary is named after Anna Knight.

===b. What education did she obtain and from where?===
In 1901 Anna Knight completed a nursing education studying under Dr. John Harvey Kellogg at Battle Creek College

===c. What became her life work?===
Education.  She also was the first black missionary.

===d. To what mission field was she the 1st overseas African American Seventh-day Adventist female Missionary?===

===c. For what is he most remembered in his ministry?===
==14. When was the first Regional Conference approved?==
===a. Where was the first regional Conference?===

Allegheny, Lake Region, and Northeastern conferences formed in 1945

===b. What year was the first region conference begun?===

On October 8, 1931, Oakwood students refused to attend classes or work.  Among the students’ grievances were: white leadership (there had been no black president and the administration was mostly white); inadequate curriculum; a work load that left no time for studies; segregation (white and black teachers were to have no social interaction); suspect white teachers (students claimed the teachers were rejects from white Adventist colleges); unjust salaries (white teachers were paid more than black teachers); inattention to student concerns; and inadequate employment opportunities after graduation.  Many Adventists who would later became famous in the denomination and dedicate their lives to the gospel ministry were leaders in the strike, including Samuel Rashford, F.L. Bland and W.W. Fordham.

Ultimately the strike was successful.  A new era began at Oakwood in 1932 when J.L. Moran became Oakwood’s first black president and an entirely black faculty was installed.  Moran occupied this position until 1945, and the close of his tenure marked the beginning of Regional Conferences.  This was a time when blacks came into their own in the Adventist church, assuming leadership positions over their own constituencies.  With the assumption of the Oakwood presidency by Moran, Oakwood became a black-run institution, a symbol of black competence and ability amidst a region where such notions were not widely held.  This black ascension to leadership was critical in ushering in Regional Conferences in 1945.

===c. Name the first five regional conferences.===
From 1945 to 1947, seven Black Conferences were formed: Allegheny, Lake Region, and Northeastern (1945), South Atlantic and South Central (1946), and Central States and Southwest Region (1947). In 1967 Allegheny divided into the Allegheny East and Allegheny West, while the South Atlantic divided into the South Atlantic and Southeastern Conferences in 1981. Regional Conferences were not formed in the two westernmost districts: Pacific and North Pacific Union Conferences. Work amongst the Black population in these areas was coordinated by a Regional Affairs Office. (Baker, “Regional Conferences”, p14.)  

Also Bermuda is a separate black dominated and black led conference within the North American Division.

''Perhaps the question intended to ask for the first 7 regional conferences. All 7 were organized by various Unions under the same historical conditions''

===d. In 1946 what Regional Conferences were added?===
''According to the quoted research, this question conflicts with question c, or at least is redundant. Perhaps the intended year in the question is 1947''.

==15. Do one of the following as a presentation at an Adventist Youth/Pathfinder Meeting, campout, or other equivalent event==
===a. Create a song, poem, story or skit about African American Adventist pioneers.===
some potential pioneers to work with:

Eva B. Dykes become the first black woman in the United States to complete requirements for the Ph.D. degree (1921).  She gave up a career at Howard to teach at Oakwood, helping it achieve accreditation. 

This timeline contains many of the answers requested here and highlights African American pioneers worth learning more about.
http://blacksdahistory.org/Timelines.html

===b. Create a display of pictures, articles, and resource materials on five (5) African American leaders in your local conference or church.===
The information for this requirement will depend on where the Pathfinder lives.

===c. Search the scriptures for at least three stories of people of color and write a one-page review of these stories: (Some resources include – Exodus 4:9-16; Exodus 18; Acts 8)===

This article contains a useful discussion of different views of the role of blacks in the Bible and notes a few examples that could be a starting point http://www.gci.org/bible/africans

Acts 8 tells the story of the Ethiopian eunuch, one of the first Gentiles to be baptized. He came from a black region, so he may have been black. In Acts 13 we read of Simeon, called Niger, the Latin term for black. There is also Lucias from Cyrene, a geographical location of black people.

'''Korean shortribs''' or '''bulgogi''' is a kind of Korean barbecue, using shortribs that have been marinated in soy sauce, scallion, ginger, chiles, garlic, and sesame oil. The marinated meat is then slow-grilled or baked.

== Ingredients ==
* 12 English-cut beef shortribs
* 1/3 cup soy sauce
* 4 scallions
* 6 cloves garlic, smashed and minced
* 1 1/2 tbs toasted sesame oil
* 2 tbs minced ginger
* 1/4 cup canola oil
* 4 Thai bird chiles, stemmed

== Procedure ==
#Combine all ingredients except meat in your blender until smooth. Pour into a gallon size zip-top bag and add shortribs. Toss to coat and refrigerate overnight. This will not tenderize it, however.
#Preheat grill to 225-300 degrees F. Add shortribs and cover. Cook 5 hours or until meat falls right off the bone and is extremely tender. Serve immediately.</text>

== Ingredients ==
* 1 (8 pound) beef brisket, trimmed to 1/4 inch of fat
* 2 tbs salt
* 2 tbs black peppercorns, cracked
* 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
* 3/4 cup yellow mustard, divided
* 2 tbs cayenne pepper
* Large mesquite chunks
* 1 tbs garlic powder
* 1/4 cup paprika
* 2 tbs hot sauce
* 9 hamburger buns
* 3 tbs molasses

== Procedure ==
#Combine hot sauce, molasses, vinegar, and 1/4 cup mustard. Pour into a spray bottle and set aside.
#Coat brisket with 1/2 cup of the mustard. Set aside.
#Combine seasonings and salt. Press mixture into both sides of brisket. Refrigerate overnight.
#The next day, heat up a smoker to 200 degrees F with the mesquite chunks. Add brisket and cook 9 hours, spraying every 3 hours with vinegar mixture, and changing wood as needed to keep temperature at 200 degrees F.
#Remove brisket from smoker and let rest 1/2 hour. Separate along the fat line and slice thinly across the grain.
#Finely chop slices and toss with remaining vinegar mixture. Place 1/9 into each bun and serve warm.

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==

If you don't have a smoker, just preheat your oven to 190 degrees F. Place 3/4 cup soaked mesquite chips in the bottom of a roasting pan and add a rack and your rubbed brisket. Cover tightly with foil and cook the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi.  My name is Brian.  I'm a computer science student in San Luis Obispo (SLO) County, California, USA.  I have a small [http://bcwells.net/ personal website], which I am in the process of expanding.  Perhaps the most interesting thing there is a prototype for a board game I call &quot;Infiltration&quot;, written in [[Python]].

Like most computer users, I have some history of using Windows.  And as a developer, I have used proprietary software tools.  But nowadays, I prefer free software almost exclusively.  Programming language-wise, I like Python, especially for quick prototyping; but I have a fairly long history with C &amp;mdash; not linked for three reasons: I hate the piped wikilink syntax, almost all developers know of it (at least), and I didn't use its wikibook to learn it &amp;mdash; and have also used [[Prolog]] somewhat (as reflected in the simplest program on my site).

Recently, I have taken an interest in [[Haskell]].  Contributing to that wikibook is the main reason why I registered as a user on this site.</text>

Note: The answer printed in the book is given as &lt;math&gt;(\frac{7}{8}, \frac{11}{8})&lt;/math&gt;. This is incorrect!

If the two lines &lt;math&gt;y_1 = -2x + 5, \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_2 = 5x - 3\,&lt;/math&gt; intersect, then &lt;math&gt;y_1 = y_2\,&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore:


&lt;math&gt;y_1 - y_2 = (-2x + 5) - (5x - 3) = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-7x + 8 = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-7x = -8 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{8}{7}&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, we can now plug in the value for x into any one of our two equations to find the point of interception:


&lt;math&gt;y_2 = 5 \cdot \frac{8}{7} - 3 = \frac{40}{7} - 3 = \frac{19}{7}&lt;/math&gt;


Thus, the point of interception is &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{8}{7}, \frac{19}{7} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

== No such thing as a metric cup ==

I know Americans (?) are obsessed with cups, but there is no such thing as a metric cup. In europe cups come in all shapes and sizes, they are not standardised. Instead more specific measurements are used. Using a measurement as coarse as a cup would result in bad crude cookery.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 1/2 tsp freshly ground cumin
* 1/2 cup tequilla (recommended:José Cuervo Especial Gold)
* 1/2 cup margarita mix
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 1 cup mesquite chips, soaked in water 30 minutes
* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
* 3 tbs fresh cilantro
* 3 chipotle chile in adobo, finely chopped
* 3 tbs adobo sauce

== Procedure ==
#Combine tequilla, oil, mix, lime, cumin, cilantro, adobo, and the chiles in a blender until smooth. Pour into a gallon size zip-top bag and add chicken. Toss to coat and refrigerate overnight. 
#The next day, preheat grill. Sprinkle both sides of chicken with salt and pepper and place on grill. Cook, turning often, until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.
#While chicken cooks, run the marinade through a cheesecloth and skim oil. Bring to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat and cook until liquid has reduced to 3 ounces.
#Once chicken is done, remove to a plate and pour marinade over. Cover tightly with foil and let rest 15 minutes before serving.</text>

There's a new trend in burgers: Non-beef burgers. Now, instead of beef, people are making them out of other meats, such as pork, fish, and game.
These are especially popular in the United States

== Ingredients ==
:1 1/4 pound skinless wild salmon filet, cut into 2-inch cubes
:[[Cookbook:Salmon Seasoning|Seafood seasoning]], such as Old Bay
:4 hamburger buns, split in half and toasted
:Extra-virgin olive oil
:3 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, finely minced
:3 tbs adobo sauce
:3 tbs [[Cookbook:Kansas City Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]]
:3 tbs unsalted butter, cut into small cubes

== Directions ==
#Run salmon cubes through a meat grinder on medium setting. Mix with chipotle, sauce, butter, and adobo.
#Form into 4 equal patties, about 3/4 inch thick. Brush with extra-virgin olive oil and season both sides liberally with seasoning. Set aside.
#Preheat grill pan to medium high. Rub with olive oil, then add salmon. Grill 5-6 minutes per side for medium rare, or until desired doneness is achieved.
#Brush buns with oil. Place a patty on and close. Serve immediately with desired condiments.

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==

You could try this with a standard grill, but they may not stay together. To cook on a standard grill, follow same directions only with a standard grill.

A few days ago, I found an excellent way to cook them on a grill: Planking. Just soak 2 untreated cedar, applewood, hickory, or mesquite planks in cold water for 1 hour. Air dry overnight, then place on the sides of one burner heated to medium low. Add 2 patties to each plank and insert a probe thermometer into one of them. Cover and cook until temperature is 140 degrees F.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the Categories chapter of [[Category Theory]].

== Definition ==

A category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; consists of four kinds of data subject to three axioms, as listed below:

=== Data ===

;Objects
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; has objects ''A'', ''B'', ''C'',…
;Morphisms
:For each ordered pair of objects ''A'', ''B'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;, there is  a class of ''morphisms'' or ''arrows'' from ''A'' to ''B''.  The notation &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; means that ''f'' is a morphism from ''A'' to ''B''.  The class of all morphisms from ''A'' to ''B'' is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt;.
;Composition
:For each ordered triple of objects ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;, there is a ''law of composition'': If &lt;math&gt;f:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:B\to C&lt;/math&gt;, then the ''composite'' of ''f'' and ''g'' is a morphism &lt;math&gt;gf:A\to C&lt;/math&gt;
;Identity
:For each object ''A'' there is a designated ''identity morphism on A'', notated as &lt;math&gt;1_A&lt;/math&gt;, from ''A'' to ''A''.

=== Axioms ===

These data satisfy the following three axioms, of which the first is in the nature of a convention, while the remaining two are more substantial:
;Unique typing
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(A_1,B_1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(A_2,B_2)&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint unless &lt;math&gt;A_1 = A_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B_1 = B_2&lt;/math&gt;.
;Associative Law
:&lt;math&gt;h(gf) = (hg)f&lt;/math&gt; if the composites are defined.  Note that if one composite is defined, the other is necessarily defined.
;Identity is a “neutral element”
:For the identity morphism &lt;math&gt;1_B: B \to B&lt;/math&gt; associated to each object ''B'',  two equations must hold for each pair of objects ''A'' and ''C'' and each pair of arrows &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g: B \to C&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;1_B \, f = f&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;g\, 1_B = g&lt;/math&gt;

===Terminology and fine points===
*If &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; in a category, ''A'' is called the '''domain''' or '''source''' of ''f'', and ''B'' is called the '''codomain''' or '''target''' of ''f''.
*&lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''hom class''' or a ''hom set''' if it is indeed a set. In general a hom set may be empty, but for any object ''A'', &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(A,A)&lt;/math&gt; is not empty because it contains the identity morphism.  
*The hom set &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; may be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; if it is necessary to specify which category is referred to. 
*Morphisms may also be called ''maps''.  This does ''not'' mean that every morphism in any category is a set function (see [[#Baby examples]] and [[#Preorders]]).  ''Arrow'' is a less misleading name.
*The composite &lt;math&gt;gf&lt;/math&gt; may be written &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt;. 
*It might be more natural to write the composite of &lt;math&gt;f:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:B\to C&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;f g&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;g f&lt;/math&gt; but the usage given here is by far the most common.  This stems from the fact that if the arrows are set functions and &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(gf)(x)=g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;g f&lt;/math&gt; is best read as &quot;do &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; ''after'' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;&quot;.

===Large and small===
The definition says that a category 'has' objects and 'has' morphisms.  This means that for any category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and ''X'' is any mathematical object, the statement ' ''X'' is an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;' is either true or false, and similarly for the statement ' ''X'' is a morphism of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;'.  The objects (or arrows) of a category need not constitute a set.  If they do, the category is said to be '''small'''.  If they don't, the category is '''large'''.

The requirement that the collection of morphisms from ''A'' to ''B'' be a ''set'' makes a category  '''locally small'''.  In this book, all categories are locally small.
===Discrete===
A category is '''discrete''' if every morphism is an identity.

==Examples of categories==

===Baby examples===

These examples are trivial and maybe uninteresting.  But do not underestimate the power of baby examples.  For one thing, they are sometimes counterexamples to possible theorems.

;0 (the empty category)
:This category has no objects and no morphisms.

;1[[Image:Baby Category 1.svg|center|40px|left]]:The category 1 has one object and one morphism, which must necessarily be the object's identity arrow.
;1+1[[Image:Baby Category 1 plus 1.svg|center|100px|none]]:This category has two objects and two morphisms: the identities on each object.  
;2[[Image:Baby Category 2.svg|center|100px|none]]:This category has two objects and ''three'' morphisms.  The third morphism goes from one object to the other.
{{hiddenh4|Remarks}}
*The objects of these baby categories are nodes in a graph (not sets) and the morphisms are arrows in the graph (not functions).
*For these baby categories we don't have to say what the composition operation does: it is always forced.
*It is impolite to say that categorists think that 1 + 1 is not equal to 2.

===The category of sets===

The ''category of sets'', denoted by '''Set''', is this category:

* The objects are all sets
* A morphism from a set ''A'' to a set ''B'' is a function with domain ''A'' and codomain ''B''.
* The composition is the usual composition:  If &lt;math&gt;f:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:B\to C&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;gf:A\to C&lt;/math&gt; is defined by &lt;math&gt;gf(x)=g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;.
* The identity morphism &lt;math&gt;1_A&lt;/math&gt; on a set ''A'' is the identity function defined by &lt;math&gt;1_A(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;.
{{hiddenh4|Terminology and fine points}}
*In order to preserve the unique typing in a function definition, it is necessary to include its codomain.  For example, &lt;math&gt;1_A:A\to A&lt;/math&gt; is a different function from the inclusion function &lt;math&gt;i:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; to some set ''B'' properly including ''A''.
*In most approaches to the foundations of math, the collection of all sets is not a set.  This makes '''Set''' a large category.

===Mathematical structures as categories===

====Preorders====

A ''preorder'' α on a set ''A'' is a reflexive and transitive relation on ''A'', which means that for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;, ''a'' α ''a'' and for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''A'', if ''a'' α ''b'' and ''b'' α c'', then ''a'' α ''c''. 

A preorder &quot;is&quot; a category in the following sense:  Given a preorder (''A'', α) the category structure is this:
*The objects of the category are the elements of ''A''.
*There is exactly one morphism from ''a'' to ''b'' if and only if ''a'' α ''b''.  
The existence of identities is forced by reflexivity and the composition law is forced by transitivity. It follows that the category structure has the property that there is at most one morphism from any object ''a'' to any object ''b''.

Conversely, suppose you have a category with set ''A'' of objects, with the property that there is at most one morphism between any two objects. Define a relation α on ''A'' by requiring that ''a'' α ''b'' if and only if there is a morphism from ''a'' to ''b''. Then (''A'', α) a preorder. 

The statements in the two preceding paragraphs describe an [[equivalence of categories]] between the category of small categories and functors and the category of preorders and order-preserving maps. 

Remark: Given a preorder, the morphisms of the corresponding category exist by definition.  There is exactly one morphism from ''a'' to ''b'' if and only if ''a'' α ''b''.  This is an axiomatic definition; in a model a morphism from ''a'' to ''b'' could be anything, for example the pair (''a'',''b'').  ''In no sense is the morphism required to be a function''.

====Groups====
Every group ''G'' can be viewed as a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; as follows: &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; has one single object; call it ''e''. Therefore it has only one homset &lt;math&gt;\text{Hom}_\mathcal{G}(e,e)&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined to be the underlying set of the group ''G'' (in other words, the arrows are the group elements.) We take as composition the group multiplication. It follows that the identity element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1_e&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that in the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, every morphism is an [[isomorphisms|isomorphism]] (invertible under composition).  Conversely, any one-object category in which all arrows are isomorphisms can be viewed as a group; the elements of the group are the arrows and the multiplication is the composition of the category.  This describes an [[equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the category of groups and homomorphisms and the category of small categories with a single object in which every morphism is an isomorphism.

This can be generalized in two ways.

A category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''groupoid''' if every morphism is an isomorphism.  Thus a groupoid can be called &quot;a group with many objects.&quot;

A '''monoid''' is a set with an associative binary operation that has an identity element.  By the same technique as for groups, any monoid &quot;is&quot; a category with exactly one object and any category with exactly one object &quot;is&quot; a monoid.

===Categories of sets with structure===
{{sectstub}}
;finite sets and functions; denoted '''FinSet'''.
;monoids and morphisms; denoted '''Mon'''.
;groups and homomorphisms; denoted '''Grp'''.
;abelian groups and homomorphisms; denoted '''Ab'''. 
;rings and unit-preserving homomorphisms; denoted '''Rng'''.
;commutative rings and unit-preserving homomorphisms; denoted '''CRng'''.
;left modules over a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and linear maps; denoted &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-'''Mod'''.
;right modules over a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and linear maps; denoted '''Mod'''-&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
;modules over a commutative ring &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and linear maps; denoted &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-'''Mod'''.
;subsets of Euclidean space of 3 dimensions and Euclidean movements
;subsets of Euclidean space of n dimensions and continuous functions
;topological spaces and continuous functions; denoted '''Top'''.
;topological spaces and homotopy classes of functions; denoted '''Toph'''.
{{hiddenh4|Remarks}}
The law of composition is not specified explicitly in describing these categories. This is the custom when the objects have underlying set-structure, the morphisms are functions of the underlying sets (transporting the additional structure), and the law of composition is merely ordinary function-composition. Indeed, sometimes even the specification of the morphisms is suppressed if no confusion would arise—thus one speaks of the category of groups.

The examples of sets with structure suggest a conceptual framework. For example, the concept of group may be regarded as constituting a first-order abstraction or generalization from various concrete, familiar realizations such as the additive group of integers, the multiplicative group of nonzero rationals, groups of permutations, symmetry groups, groups of Euclidean motions, and so on. Then, again, the notion of a category constitutes a second-order abstraction, the concrete realizations of which consist of such first-order abstractions as the category of groups, the category of rings, the category of topological spaces, and so on.

==Properties of objects and morphisms==
{{sectstub}}
===Isomorphisms===
A morphism ''f'': ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' in a category is said to be an '''isomorphism''' if there is a morphism ''g'': ''B'' &amp;rarr; ''A'' in the category with ''gf'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''fg'' = 1&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is easy to prove that ''g'' is then uniquely determined by ''f''. The morphism ''g'' is called the '''inverse''' of ''f'', written ''g'' = ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  It follows that ''f'' = ''g''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.  If there is an isomorphism from ''A'' to ''B'', we say ''A'' is '''isomorphic''' to ''B'', and it is easy to prove that &quot;isomorphism&quot; is an equivalence relation on the objects of the category.
====Examples====

* A function from ''A'' to ''B'' in the category of sets is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective.
* A homomorphism of groups is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective.
* The isomorphisms of the category of topological spaces and continuous maps are the homeomorphisms. In contrast to the preceding example, a bijective continuous map from one topological space to another need not be a homeomorphism because its inverse (as a set function) may not be continuous. An example is the identity map on the set of real numbers, with the domain having the discrete topology and the codomain having the usual topology.

===Monomorphisms and Epimorphisms===

A morphism ''f'' in a category ''C'' is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomorphism monomorphism] if, for any morphisms ''g'' and ''h'', if ''fh'' and ''fg'' are defined and ''fg=fh'' then ''g=h''. 


A morphism ''f'' in a category ''C'' is an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimorphism epimorphism] if, for any morphisms ''g'' and ''h'', if ''gf'' and ''hf'' are defined and ''gf=hf'' then ''g=h''.

===Initial and terminal objects===
&lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;  is said to be a terminal (or final) object when &lt;math&gt; X \to T &lt;/math&gt; is a unique morphism for any &lt;math&gt;X &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;. The law of composition ensures that if &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; are terminal objects in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, they are isomorphic, i.e., &lt;math&gt;T(')&lt;/math&gt; is unique up to isomorphism. In the categories of sets, groups, and topological spaces, the terminal objects are singletons, trivial groups, and one-point spaces, respectively. &quot;b&quot; is the terminal object in '''2''' as depicted above.

==Constructions on categories==
{{sectstub}}
===Subcategories===
A ''subcategory'' &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; of a category &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; is a category in which:
*The class of objects of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is contained in the class of objects of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;.
*The class of arrows of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is contained in the class of arrows of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;.
*For every arrow &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;, the domain and codomain of &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; are in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;.
*For every object &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;, the identity arrow &lt;math&gt; 1_s &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;.
*For every pair of arrows &lt;math&gt; f,g &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt;, the arrow &lt;math&gt; g \circ f &lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; where it is defined.

===Opposite category===
Given a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the ''opposite (or dual) category'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt; has the same objects as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and for every arrow &lt;math&gt;f:a \to b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the arrow &lt;math&gt;f^{\text{op}}:b \to a&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{\text{op}}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, it has the same objects, and arrows are reversed.

===The product of two categories===
Given two categories &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, the ''product category'', denoted &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} \times \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, is given by the following data:
*The objects of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} \times \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt; (b, c) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; is an object of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;.
*The arrows of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} \times \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt; (f, g) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is an arrow of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; is an arrow of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;.
*Composition is given by &lt;math&gt; (f',g') \circ (f,g) = (f' \circ f, g' \circ g)  &lt;/math&gt;.

===Arrow categories===
*A ''functor category'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}^{\mathcal{C}}&lt;/math&gt; is a category whose objects are functors &lt;math&gt;T:\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; and arrows are natural transformations.
*A functor category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{\mathbf{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''arrow category'', denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}^{\rightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;. Its objects are arrows &lt;math&gt;f:a' \to b'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and its arrows are pairs of arrows &lt;math&gt;(h,k):f \to f'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f' \circ h=k \circ f&lt;/math&gt;.

===Comma categories===
*Given categories and functors &lt;math&gt;T:\mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S:\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, the ''comma category'' &lt;math&gt;(T \downarrow S)&lt;/math&gt; has objects &lt;math&gt;(e,d,f)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is an object in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is an object in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f:Te \to Sd&lt;/math&gt; is an arrow in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Its arrows are &lt;math&gt;(k,h):(e,d,f) \to (e',d',f')&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k:e \to e'&lt;/math&gt; is an arrow in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h:d \to d'&lt;/math&gt; is an arrow in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;Sh \circ f = f' \circ Tf&lt;/math&gt;. Composition is given by &lt;math&gt;(k,h) \circ (k',h') = (k \circ k', h \circ h')&lt;/math&gt;. The identity is &lt;math&gt;1_{(e,d,f)}=(1_e,1_d)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If an attacker has unrestricted physical access to a system, then, unless the data is encrypted, it becomes almost impossible to prevent full compromise. Programs such as the Ophcrack liveCD allow Windows passwords to be easily broken; while any liveCD will allow access to the data stored on the drives. It also becomes possible for an attacker to install malicious hardware, such as a keylogger, or a hidden wireless access point, allowing them into the network from outside, Because of this, it is crucial that you keep your site physically secure.

== Categorization stuff ==

In response to a few of my questions that came up in the reading room, I have gone through all pages generated a list of books, more or less by hand.  I was planning to work my way through this and see which books were missing subject/DCC/LOC/Alphabetization tags.  Anything I come across I am just going to add empty tags to, and thereby populate the appropriate maintenance categories. Somehow I thought you'd like to know to check these lists every so often, and I will probably not start sorting out these until I am done populating the lists.  Somehow this seemed better to me then trying to put things into subjects quickly, and possibly making mistakes.

I have a thought about one of the issues I raised in the reading room about the Orphaned page list.  I think most (and maybe eventually all) books will be linked from the Category that contains the pages of their books, so I am not entirely sure even if we get rid of bookshelves that there would be any problem with this list. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 11:44, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

:That's right!  They will be linked from their category and then be removed from the orphaned page list.  I had completely forgotten about that.  I think your plan for putting empty tags on is fine, as the pages would otherwise only show up in Alphabetical.  I did a bit of work trimming the orphaned page list yesterday and will likely continue to work on that while you do this.  The good news is that we've cleared uncategorized categories and pages. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:27, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

:: Yeah, I will be interested to see how many books end up not having alphabetical tags.  There may be has many as 200-300 hundred depending on the number of soft redirects that exist.  (At least that is the magnitude of the difference between the number of books on my list and the number give by {{tlx|NUMBEROFBOOKS}}.

== Infoboxes ==

Your recent changes to {{tlx|infobox}} and to the related css has caused all the [[Special:PrefixIndex/Infobox/|old infoboxes]] to display nothing. That is why someone created {{tlx|infobox2}} for templates imported from Wikipedia. I think the template needs to be restored to its original state or all the old infoboxes deleted. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:48, 2 August 2009 (UTC)
:I think the old infoboxes should be deleted since they no longer operate correctly anyway.  The old code has been restored, however, since I do not desire to delete them all without support from others.  I don't think it was a smart move to deviate such a highly-used template from its original form as imported from Wikipedia (the oldest revisions match up with Wikipedia's template history). -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:03, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

:: Maybe the template wasn't as highly used back when Wikibooks first used it. I know you imported its revision history so its hard to tell for sure where the local history beings now... --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:08, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

:::Well that would explain the oldest revisions matching up.  Don't I feel embarrassed for forgetting.  The current infobox could be updated for the current Wikibooks structure and placed at a new name and infobox2 moved to the old location, if we wanted to avoid confusion. Assuming the functionality infobox provides is still desired. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:19, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I've noticed that [[Template:Mbox|mbox]]es no longer have visible borders.  (Recall that besides providing visual coherence, those borders are color-coded.)  Might this have been caused by the above-mentioned css tinkering?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:29, 2 August 2009 (UTC)
:They still have colors when I view them.  The &quot;message box types&quot; on [[Template:Mbox]] have grey borders and a color splotch on the left, and the image message boxes have a colored border and a color splotch on the bottom.  That's how I've always seen them. I cleared my cache and they still look that way. Darklama removed the duplicate code for infoboxes and none of it should have affected the mboxes in the first place. They use class &quot;messagebox&quot; and not &quot;infobox&quot;. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:34, 2 August 2009 (UTC)
::Well, that made it seem likely that the problem was on my end, so I did some poking around.  Not exactly on my end, apparently &amp;mdash; the problem occurs for me only, and consistently, on the secure server.  I don't know exactly how long the problem has been there, because it's been a few days since I last visited a page that would show it; it could be just since this morning, or anytime in the last few days (but I'm fairly certain I visited one of those pages sometime earlier this week).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 21:26, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

== BTEC Applied Science forum ==

Adrignola,

Please could you restore the forum page for the book? I haven't done any work on the book lately but hope to change that. The forum had a very long list of discussions from other sites which teachers of the course would find useful.

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] ([[User talk:Ewen|talk]]) 11:39, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

:Sorry about that.  The page appeared to not be used by the book.  Taking a closer look, I see why.  It was linked to with an absolute link as if it were an external site from the book's table of contents.  Thus, it showed up in the orphaned pages list.  I've restored the page and also fixed the table of contents link so that the page properly shows up as being linked to.  I apologize for any inconvenience. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:51, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

== Delete this page posts ==

I noted that you made this posts on the All Chapter and Print Version and noted by the first time that these pages are now included on the Category &quot;Pages where template include size is exceeded&quot; is this a new thing what made this happen ?
I note also that the Ada Programming also is listed there (also a huge book) and I had envisioned using this system in another two books that I've been working out. It is a major help (to me it didn't/doesn't take more that 12 seconds to load the C++ Programming page) and is used there to generate the PDF file (so the book that use it, or intend to support such features will be highly impacted in their usefulness). What can be done ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:20, 5 August 2009 (UTC)
:[[Help:Collections]] seems to imply that you can specify the many pages of a book individually and it will coalesce them together into a PDF when you select that as the output file.  I'm not too familiar with it, but I would imagine you could use this to generate the PDF and when people want to print, they can print each of the chapter print versions (which will actually load all their transcluded templates) in turn. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:25, 5 August 2009 (UTC)
::This implies that the automation will be broken and increases (with a high chance of probability) that something will be missing from those print versions (on the C++ Programming I will try to negotiate with the most stable parts of the book). For now I will replace the pages with a note to users (since most people will not understand the category tag and can get to print the incomplete version, I will also add a note on the Ada book to the same effect). I had a message from someone that was marrowing the C++ programming in a local install of the Wikimedia software.

== Excluding templates from print versions ==

I gather you've been looking for a way to include a navbox-type template in content pages only when they are viewed directly, leaving out the navbox when the content pages are transcluded into a print version?  (At least, that's what I imagined to be your motivation when, a while back, I noticed you trying some such experiment at Wikijunior:Languages, which has all those obnoxious explicit noincludes on the content pages.)  So I was wondering what you'd think of this technique:
In slowly gearing up to add automatic print-version generation to the Template:Navlist suite,  I've set up {{tlx|Navlist/Top}} and {{tlx|Navlist/Bottom}} so that they wrap everything in
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifeq:{{SUBPAGENAME}}|Print version|| ... }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&amp;mdash; omitting the navboxes just from pages with that subpagename.  It ''is'' then a bit fussy to generate wiki markup that involves pipes and such; I actually didn't bother, just used html TABLE instead, although I know there are a bunch of templates for generating wiki markup in just this sort of situation.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:35, 5 August 2009 (UTC)

I'm not that interested in a PDF version, since it's most likely huge and i usually have internet access, so i can check the most up-to-date version in the environment that i am very familiar with. Does the PDF include internal links? I'll try to check Fx and see if i can reproduce the issues and find out what causes them.

Also, about the code in question, i am not sure i completely get it.

I get the No target page, stating that &quot;You have not specified a target page or user to perform this function on.&quot; but I'm not given the page to enter it. A temporary problem within Wikimedia ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:54, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

::::Ok reduced it to the books with ++ in the name (testes it with pages in the C++ Programming book and Understanding C++).

== A Wonderful Indian History ==

Closed the VfD for this, just a heads up [[User:Geoff Plourde|Geoff Plourde]] ([[User talk:Geoff Plourde|talk]]) 03:56, 9 August 2009 (UTC)

: I don't understand the VfD discussion for &quot;A Wonderful Indian History&quot;. Our [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] requires us to reach some sort of &quot;consensus&quot; before deleting a Wikibook listed on [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]], right?
: I see 3 commenters in favor of &quot;not deleting immediately&quot;, and 1 commenter in favor of deleting -- the same commenter who then deleted that Wikibook. That doesn't look like a consensus to delete to me. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:19, 10 August 2009 (UTC)
:You should read the comments more closely.  They were only keep because, at the time, the page was recently created.  The page was then queried for over a week.  With no activity since creation and no meaningful content added, it qualified for a speedy deletion.  Also take a look at when the discussion started, when the comments were posted, and then finally when the page was actually deleted.  Had you actually taken a look at what this page contained?  A single sentence hardly warrants a full-blown VfD discussion.  Had it started as a {{tlx|delete}} and been changed to a {{tlx|vfd}} it might have been different. As it was I felt enough time had passed to see if it would develop further; the author had been notified via a query; and comments against were not related to the book but rather the timing of the nomination. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:54, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

== Categories of the [[Songbook]] ==

You delete some categories of the &quot;Songbook&quot;. But the Songbook needs much more categories. In the German version of the Songbook there are around 30 subcategories some are made for a guitar-course, outer are for the kind of song. 
[http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kategorie:Liederbuch http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Kategorie:Liederbuch]
* American-Folk
* Ballads
* Child song
* Christmas songs
* Classical music
* Folk-Songs
* Guitar Course
* Gospel
* Hawaii Music
* Hymn
* Instrumental
* Irish-Folk
* Latin
* New Song
* proofreading
* Song accompaniment
* Songs
* Songs by genre
* Songs without genre
* Swing
* Tablature
* Christmas songs
* Songs by language
** Songs in German
** Songs in English
** Songs in French
** Hawaiian songs
** Songs in Hebrew
** Creole songs
** Songs in Spanish
As you can surely imagine, these categories for a song book are very meaningful. These Songbook is not only made for itself. It is also a reference for outer book-projects that may be started. 

Could you help me to establish the right categories or help me by finding a workable solution, because I'm not familiar with the habits of the English wikibooks. And my English is definitely not the best one.--[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 19:32, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

:If these are needed, they should be of the name Songbook/American-Folk and Songbook/Ballads to indicate they are specific to a book rather than general categories that books are filed in.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:18, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

== A Wonderful Indian History ==

I still don't understand the VfD discussion for &quot;A Wonderful Indian History&quot;.
I carefully read, as you suggested at
[[User_talk:Adrignola/2009/08#A_Wonderful_Indian_History]],
the comments at [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion/A Wonderful Indian History]].

I count exactly one (1) person in favor of deleting.

Our [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]] requires us to reach some sort of &quot;consensus&quot; before deleting a Wikibook listed on Wikibooks:Votes for deletion.

Last time I checked, one (1) person was not a consensus.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 10:22, 22 August 2009 (UTC)

:The page was queried for over a week and had no meaningful content.  Comments made stated that it was too soon to discuss its deletion.  When it was finally deleted, it was nearly two weeks and nothing was heard from the original author and nothing was added to the page.  Yes, it was listed on Votes for Deletion.  However, VFDs have been closed as speedy deletes before should the book meet the criteria.  Further, the person who put it on the VFD page just saw the tag on it and felt obligated to start a discussion to correspond with the tag.  However, a later edit by the person who originally put a VFD tag on there changed it to a query, leading me to believe the VFD discussion was not originally intended.  I frankly don't think you've seen the &quot;book&quot; in question given your insistence on a full-blown VFD discussion for two short sentences. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:54, 22 August 2009 (UTC)
== Chess pages ==

Hi, Please stop deleting pages in Chess/ just because they are orphaned does NOT mean they are not used. We now have many dead links from wikipedia pages. So many will have to go recreate them. e.g [[w: Indian Defence]] links to [[Chess/Indian_Defense]].  23:35, 21 August 2009 (UTC)
:: BTW the claim on the page deletion that they are orphaned redirect'' is also incorrect. They are all linked within wikibooks from [[Talk:Chess/Index_of_chess_topics]] [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 23:41, 21 August 2009 (UTC)
:::Thanks for you help with much of the moving of pages from 'Opening theory in chess' to 'Chess Opening Theory'. Great that you make many changes even if a few mistakes. Regards, [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 01:15, 22 August 2009 (UTC)
::::The move created a great deal of double redirects, which I did try to correct.  It seemed to me that the page you referenced was severely out of date, linking to incorrectly placed pages (not following naming convention).  

::::If Wikipedia is linking to pages on Wikibooks, I find it odd that redirects were created and the Wikipedia linked to the redirects, rather than Wikipedia linked to the destination page in the first place.  Linking to a page created as a redirect means a single page move (as was the case in the book's renaming) causes all the links to that redirect to not work since they are double redirects.  This would be something to keep in mind.  I am sorry for any inconvenience, however.  I can see about fixing links on Wikipedia now that you've pointed this out; they need to be fixed due to the move anyway.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:47, 22 August 2009 (UTC)
::::::Hi, no /Chess/Page redirects where not out of date. They where in use and correct until book renamed. All they required was link updating with new book name.

== Rotational motion ==

Sorry, I thought that GFDL didn't require such attribution. I think that the content is most appropriate for [[High school physics]] but that there is definitely enough possible content for a [[Rotational Motion]] book (right now it is just scattered throughout Wikibooks). I was just trying to get the ball rolling on such a book by duplicating the content.--[[User:Jorfer|Jorfer]] ([[User talk:Jorfer|talk]]) 21:35, 24 August 2009 (UTC)
:From looking at request for import, it would seem that only an entire article should be transferred this way rather than one section. The change occurred [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Precession&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=99258185 here] and no changes to that section since the new licensing was implemented meaning the content is under GFDL only. I looked up at the new [[wikimedia:Terms of Use]] and found that GFDL only material was off-limits but creative-commons only material was within limits. Why it this? Either they are compatible or not unless there is some weird clause governing additional terms in one and not the other.--[[User:Jorfer|Jorfer]] ([[User talk:Jorfer|talk]]) 04:23, 26 August 2009 (UTC)
::Either? You can choose? Don't you mean both. How can you revoke a license once it has been granted like with previous GFDL only contributions?--[[User:Jorfer|Jorfer]] ([[User talk:Jorfer|talk]]) 04:56, 26 August 2009 (UTC)
:::I read the terms of use as listed above, but it seems to contradict [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3-faq.html FDL 1.3 FAQ] as the FAQ says that they can only be licensed under either until August 1, 2009 (I get now that it is not revoking the GFDL license to change the license to Creative Commons Share Alike: it is simply invoking the Creative Commons Clause). Does that mean that mean that instead of being licensed under either that edits since August 1 are licensed under both?--[[User:Jorfer|Jorfer]] ([[User talk:Jorfer|talk]]) 22:36, 26 August 2009 (UTC)
::::Thanks. I remember voting on the issue, but I didn't understand the issue in depth. It is pretty complicated. I wish I was better notified of this. The wiki pages do a poor job of covering it with information scattered among different pages and a lack of explanations.--[[User:Jorfer|Jorfer]] ([[User talk:Jorfer|talk]]) 02:05, 27 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Types of functors */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the Functors chapter of [[Category Theory]].

== Definition ==

A ''functor'' is a morphism between categories. Given categories &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, a functor &lt;math&gt; T: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; has domain &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; and codomain &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt;, and consists of two suitably related functions:
*The ''object function'' &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;, which assigns to each object &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, an object &lt;math&gt; Tc &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt;.
*The ''arrow function'' (also &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;), which assigns to each arrow &lt;math&gt; f: c \to c' &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, an arrow &lt;math&gt; Tf: Tc \to Tc' &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt;, such that it satisfies &lt;math&gt; T(1_c)=1_{Tc} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; T(g \circ f)=Tg \circ Tf &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; g \circ f &lt;/math&gt; is defined.

== Examples ==

*The ''power set functor '' is a functor &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}:\textbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;. Its object function assigns to every set &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, its power set &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}X &lt;/math&gt; and its arrow function assigns to each map &lt;math&gt; f:X \to Y &lt;/math&gt;, the map &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}f: \mathcal{P}X \to \mathcal{P}Y &lt;/math&gt;.
*The ''inclusion functor'' &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I}:\mathcal{S} \to \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; sends every object in a subcategory &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; to itself (in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;).

== Types of functors ==

*A functor &lt;math&gt; T: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; is an ''isomorphism of categories'' if it is a bijection on both objects and arrows.
*A functor &lt;math&gt; T: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; is called ''full'' if, for every pair of objects &lt;math&gt; c,c' &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; and every arrow &lt;math&gt; g:Tc \to Tc' &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt;, there exists an arrow &lt;math&gt; f:c \to c' &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; g=Tf &lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is surjective on arrows given objects &lt;math&gt; c,c' &lt;/math&gt;.
*A functor &lt;math&gt; T: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; is called ''faithful'' if, for every pair of objects &lt;math&gt; c,c' &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; and every pair of parallel arrows &lt;math&gt; f_1,f_2:c \to c' &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, the equality &lt;math&gt; Tf_1 = Tf_2:Tc \to Tc' &lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt; f_1=f_2 &lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; is injective on arrows given objects &lt;math&gt; c,c' &lt;/math&gt;. The inclusion functor is faithful.
*A functor &lt;math&gt; T:\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{B} &lt;/math&gt; is called ''forgetful'' if it &quot;forgets&quot; some or all aspects of the structure of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;.

      <comment>/* Duality */ I started cleaning this up, but there are a lot of issues with this section... seems like it is straight from a textbook?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">One further basic notion in the theory of categories, or, as it may be said, a basic item of categorical language, will now be introduced. This is the notion of a natural transformation of functors from one category to another. Indeed, the whole language and apparatus of categories and functors were developed initially by the U.S. mathematicians Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane in order to render precise the intuitive concept of naturality. First an example will be given, the example that may be said to have motivated the definition.

== Motivating example ==

Let V be a vector space over some field K, and let V* be the dual space of V; that is, the space of linear functionals on V. There is then a linear transformation T: V &amp;rarr; V** that is given. There is an intuitive feeling that the linear transformation T is natural because its description only involves the terms u and f. Now if V is finite-dimensional, then it is known that T is an isomorphism in the category of vector spaces over K and linear transformations. One way of proving that T is then an isomorphism is to show that V and V** are isomorphic and then to observe that T is one–one. The usual proof that V and V** are isomorphic would be to proceed by establishing an isomorphism between V and V*, in the case when V is finite-dimensional. Now if a base &lt;math&gt;(e_1, e_2, \dots , e_K)&lt;/math&gt; for V is given, then a basis for V* may be set up, called the dual basis, by defining ei* to be that linear functional on V given by certain rules (see 350). Then the correspondence ei « ei* sets up an isomorphism between V and V*.

On the other hand, this isomorphism does not look natural, because it depends on the choice of bases. Of course, the argument above could be generalized to set up a linear transformation from V to V* even if V is not finite-dimensional over K, but, again, this transformation would not appear to be natural. What is required is a formal and precise expression of the feeling that, for finite-dimensional vector spaces V over the field K, V and V** are naturally isomorphic, while V and V* are isomorphic in some unnatural way. Eilenberg and MacLane solved this problem in their seminal article, “General Theory of Natural Equivalences,” published in 1945, which laid the foundation of the theory of categories.

== Duality ==

For any category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; a new category &lt;math&gt;C^{op}&lt;/math&gt; can be formed by interchanging the domains and codomains of the morphisms of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, in the category &lt;math&gt;C^{op}&lt;/math&gt; the objects are simply those of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and the effect of interchange of domains is expressed in an equation (see 359). Moreover, the composition in &lt;math&gt;C^{op}&lt;/math&gt; is simply that of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, suitably interpreted. &lt;math&gt;C^{op}&lt;/math&gt; is called the category opposite to &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;; notice that &lt;math&gt;C^{op^{op}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. This apparently trivial operation leads to highly significant results when specific categories are used. In the general setting it enables any concept in the language of categories to be dualized. For example, the coproduct in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is simply the product in &lt;math&gt;C^{op}&lt;/math&gt;. Any theorem that holds in an arbitrary category has a dual form. For example, the theorem asserting that the product in an arbitrary category is associative may be effectively restated as asserting that the coproduct in an arbitrary category is associative. In the special cases, however, the second statement looks very different from the first. For example, in the category of sets, the coproduct becomes the disjoint union; in the category of groups it is the free product; and in a pre-ordered set regarded as a category, the coproduct is the least upper bound. In particular, for the set of natural numbers, ordered by divisibility, the coproduct is the LCM. Thus, the same universal argument that led to the deduction that the GCD is associative also indicates that the LCM is associative. The duality principle has very wide ramifications indeed. Here it is merely noted that the important concept of a contravariant functor from to may be most simply defined as a functor from 0 to . Thus the association of the dual vector space V* with V yields a contravariant functor from

== Definition of natural transformation==

Suppose  &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; are two functors, both  from the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; to the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D&lt;/math&gt;.

Then a ''natural transformation'' &lt;math&gt;\eta : \Phi \to \Psi&lt;/math&gt;  is a rule that assigns to each object ''A'' of category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; a morphism &lt;math&gt;\eta_A : \Phi(A) \to_{\mathcal D} \Psi(A)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The morphisms &lt;math&gt;\eta_A&lt;/math&gt;involved must be subject to the condition that the diagram 
[[Image:Naturality.png|center|200px|none ]]
should be commutative for every &lt;math&gt;f: A \to_{\mathcal C} B&lt;/math&gt; (note ''f'' is a morphism in the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;); that is, &lt;math&gt;\Psi(f) \circ \eta_A = \eta_B \circ \Phi(f)&lt;/math&gt; (note the commutative diagram is drawn in category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D&lt;/math&gt;).

== Natural isomorphisms ==

Further, if &lt;math&gt;\eta_A&lt;/math&gt; is invertible for each ''A'', then &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is said to be natural isomorphism (or a natural equivalence). It is clear that if &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is a natural equivalence from functors &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\eta^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, given by an equation (see 352), is a natural equivalence from functors &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the term equivalence used here is fully justified. Indeed, the functors from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D&lt;/math&gt; may be collected into equivalence classes according to the existence of a natural equivalence between them.

== Examples ==

This definition can be tested against the example. There are two functors from ''K''-Vect to ''K''-Vect, in which ''K''-Vect is the category of vector spaces over the field ''K'' and linear transformations. One functor is the identity functor. The other functor is the double dual functor ** that associates with every vector space ''V'' its double dual ''V''** and with every linear transformation ''f'' : ''U'' &amp;rarr; ''V'' in the linear transformation ''f''**: ''U''** &amp;rarr; ''V''** (see 353). A linear transformation ''T'': ''V'' &amp;rarr; ''V''** was described above. It is easy to check that ''T'' is a natural transformation from the identity functor to the functor **. If the subcategory f of ''K''-Vect that consists of finite-dimensional vector spaces over ''K'' and their linear transformations is considered, then it turns out that the functor ** transforms f into itself; and the natural transformation ''T'', restricted to f, is then a natural equivalence. Further examples of natural transformations of functors can be given:

* The category of Abelian groups and homomorphisms is considered. With every Abelian group may be associated its torsion subgroup. The torsion subgroup AT of the Abelian group A consists of those elements of A that are of finite order. A homomorphism from A to B must necessarily send AT to BT. Thus a functor f is obtained from to (or to T, the category of torsion Abelian groups and their homomorphisms), by associating with every Abelian group A the Abelian group FA = AT. Now AT is a subgroup of A. Thus there is always an embedding iA of AT in A. It is easy to see that i is a natural transformation from the torsion functor f to the identity functor. Further, the quotient group Afr = A/AT may be considered. It is a torsion-free Abelian group. This gives a functor g from to (or from to fr, the category of torsion-free Abelian groups) by associating with the Abelian group A the Abelian group GA = Afr. Then the projection of A onto Afr yields a natural transformation from the identity functor to the torsion-free functor g.
* With every group may be associated its commutator subgroup. It is then not difficult to see that the embedding of the commutator subgroup in the group is a natural transformation from the commutator subgroup functor to the identity functor. On the other hand, the centre of every group may be associated with the group. Here, however, there is not a functor because a homomorphism from one group to another does not necessarily map the centre of the first group to the centre of the second. On the other hand, if the category of groups and surjective homomorphisms (a surjective homomorphism is one in which the image coincides with the codomain) is considered, then in this category the centre is a functor. It is a functor, however, from the category of groups and surjective homomorphisms to the category of groups and all homomorphisms, because a surjective homomorphism does not necessarily map the centre surjectively. Then the embedding of the centre of a group in the group may be regarded as a natural transformation from the centre functor to the inclusion functor, both of which are functors from the category of groups and surjective homomorphisms to the category of groups and homomorphisms.
* In algebraic topology, the singular homology groups and the homotopy groups of a pointed topological space (X, x) are considered. A Hurewicz homomorphism (see 354) exists, from the homotopy groups to the homology groups. Then pn and hn, n &amp;ge; 2, are functors from the category of pointed spaces and pointed continuous functions to the category of Abelian groups, and the Hurewicz homomorphism is a natural transformation of functors.

==The Yoneda lemma== 

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a locally small category, let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be an object in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;K:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;h^X&lt;/math&gt; denote the covariant Hom functor, and let &lt;math&gt;\text{Nat}(F,G)&lt;/math&gt; denote the natural transformations from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\text{Nat}(h^X,K)\cong KX&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is another Hom functor &lt;math&gt;h^W&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\text{Nat}(h^X,h^W)\cong \text{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(W,X)&lt;/math&gt;.

An important procedure that is made possible by the use of categorical language is the relation of apparently distinct concepts in various categories. Here an example is given, but it should be pointed out that the technique described is of extremely broad application.

==Limits==
In the category of sets, the notion of Cartesian product is vital. Its description, however, involves mention of the elements of the sets: the Cartesian product of the sets X and Y consists of the ordered pairs (x, y), X x, y Y. In a definition of the product of two objects in an arbitrary category, this definition cannot be imitated because, in the definition of a category, it is not required that the objects should be sets with elements. Therefore, a property of the Cartesian product X ´ Y must be found that characterizes the Cartesian product and that can be expressed in the language of categories. Such a property must be entirely expressible in terms of the data of a category: in terms of objects, morphisms, and composition of morphisms.

For any given set A and functions f: A → X, g: A → Y, there is a unique function h: A → X ´ Y such that equations involving two projections hold (see 355), in which p1: X ´ Y → X, p2: X ´ Y → Y are the projections. This is the clue to the generalization. For two objects X and Y of the category, the triple (Z; p1, p2) is taken to be a product of X and Y if p1: Z → X and p2: Z → Y are morphisms of, and if the universal property holds that, given any object A of and morphisms f: A → X, g: A → Y, there exists a unique morphism h: A → Z such that certain relations hold (see 355).

It is easy to prove that the triple (Z; p1, p2) is, essentially, uniquely determined by the universal property. This means that if (Z¢; p1¢, p2¢) is also a product, then there exists a unique isomorphism w: Z → Z¢ in such that two equalities hold (see 356). Therefore, it is permissible to speak of the product of X and Y in . Of course, X and Y do not necessarily have a product in . If they do have a product in, in the sense defined above, however, then that product is unique. Now the product may be sought in various other categories. For example, in the category of Abelian groups the product, as defined, characterizes the direct sum; in the category of topological spaces it characterizes the topological product. In any category corresponding to a pre-ordered set, the product characterizes the greatest lower bound. Thus, in particular, in the category corresponding to the natural numbers ordered by divisibility, the product is precisely the GCD. It is possible to prove that the product in any category in which it exists is associative in the following sense. Given three objects X1, X2, and X3, then there is an equivalence (see 357). This is, of course, a completely familiar—and trivial—fact for sets: in considering the Cartesian product of three sets, the way in which the sets are to be associated is not relevant. If a proof has been given that is valid in any category, however, it is immediately possible to deduce, for example, that the greatest common divisor satisfies associativity. That is, if a, b, c are any three natural numbers, then a relation involving the GCD holds (see 358). Here there are two points to be made. First, there was no apparent connection between this statement (358) and the statement that the Cartesian product of sets is associative. Second, by proving the statement in sufficient generality—i.e., at the categorical level—it is possible to obtain many more instances of the theorem than could have been obtained by simply being confined to the original category in which the definition of product was carried out; that is, the category of sets.

Tests, classes, observations!!! When will it all end? I am excited about becoming a teacher, but so many hurdles to jump.  I still have a few tests to take. I do believe though, like the author of this article says, all of my hard work, sweat, and tears will be worth it.[[User:Msmhobbs04|Msmhobbs04]] ([[User talk:Msmhobbs04|talk]]) 20:13, 9 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Older instructions (deprecated)=

These older instructions are kept for reference, but are outdated. Unless you specifically need to compile the old KDE3 version of Kdenlive, you should not use these instructions, but the instructions above.

In order to use Kdenlive your system must have some other installed software in which Kdenlive depends:

* DVD creation needs [http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/ dvdauthor]
* DVD burning needs [http://www.k3b.org K3B]
* DVD preview needs [http://www.xinehq.de Xine]
* Firewire capture needs [http://www.kinodv.org/article/static/1 DVgrab &gt;= 2.0] and [http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/ FFMpeg]

In most cases, the installer will install the needed software automatically. If any of these are missing, Kdenlive will warn you. Just close Kdenlive, install the missing software and restart Kdenlive.

== Ark Linux ==
Ark Linux includes kdenlive and all it needs. Just run

 apt-get install kdenlive

Or select kdenlive in Mission Control -&gt; Install Software.

== Debian ==

Debian binary packages are provided by Christian Marillat.

Add the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list file:

For Unstable version:

 deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org sid main

For Stable version:

 deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org etch main

For Testing (currently Lenny):

 deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org testing main

If you haven't done so yet, import Marillat's key:

 gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 1F41B907
 gpg --armor --export 1F41B907 &gt; key.asc
 sudo apt-key add key.asc

Then, simply type
 sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install kdenlive

Debian installer will automatically install kdenlive 0.5 and the requested libraries.  Currently this method doesn't work due to uninstallable dependencies (kdebase-runtime and kdelibs5 &gt;= 4:4.1.0)&lt;br&gt;
If you need Kdenlive 0.6 svn, please read the source section below.

== Fedora (and RedHat) ==

RPMs for Fedora Core 6 can be downloaded from this page: [http://lucarasp.altervista.org/php5/index.php?title=Video kdenlive and mlt for Fedora Core 6]. Unfortunately it's my very first packaging effort, so use them with caution. 

For Fedora 7, use this source: [http://math.ifi.unizh.ch/fedora/ kdenlive and mlt for Fedora 7]

Install the above dependencies using yum or apt:

&lt;pre&gt;
 yum install ffmpeg xine dvdauthor dvgrab kdebase 
&lt;/pre&gt;

After downloading RPMs, we suppose RPMs to be in /tmp, install with:

&lt;pre&gt;
 cd /tmp
 rpm -Uvh kdenlive*.rpm mlt*.rpm
&lt;/pre&gt;

Good luck!

...Anyway, you may try to install the Mandriva RPM indicated below...

== Gentoo ==
Gentoo users can simply install kdenlive using portage. 0.4 is available in portage since april 2007, 0.5 will come out soon. An unofficial SVN version is available as well, see below.

First, if you haven't synced your portage tree for a long time, do
 emerge --sync

Then, since some dependencies (and kdenlive itself) are masked with the &quot;testing&quot;-keyword,
 nano -w /etc/portage/package.keywords
and add the following lines (adjust to your architecture):
 media-libs/mlt ~x86
 media-libs/mlt++ ~x86
 media-video/dvgrab ~x86
 media-video/kdenlive ~x86
Now you can simply
 emerge -av kdenlive

This will currently install 0.4. If you want to install the 0.5 version, you may either install from sources (which is quite straitforward) or get an unofficial ebuild from [http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188626 here], directly from the Gentoo bugzilla.

'''kdenlive SVN version'''

On November 24th, always in the Gentoo bugzilla, has been posted a kdenlive-svn ebuild. This ebuild is not officially supported and it may work or not. If you want to give it a try, you can [http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200174 get it here]. You may read [http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Installing_3rd_Party_Ebuilds  http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Installing_3rd_Party_Ebuilds] for more details on installing 3rd party ebuilds.
&lt;!--

You may install it with portage by making a 3rd party overlay as follows
 mkdir /usr/local/portage/
Append this to /etc/make.conf
 PORTDIR_OVERLAY=&quot;/usr/local/portage&quot;
Then, make a spot for kdenlive, 
 mkdir /usr/local/portage/media-video
 mkdir /usr/local/portage/media-video/kdenlive
download from [http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200174 bugzilla] the latest kdenlive-9999 ebuild, save it into the directory and digest it.
 cd /usr/local/portage/media-video/kdenlive
 ebuild kdenlive-9999.ebuild digest
Now you are ready to emerge,
 emerge -pv =media-video/kdenlive-9999
if all looks good then emerge. 
--&gt;

== Mandriva ==
You can install kdenlive 0.5 (i686/MMX) in Mandriva 2007 installing the following 4 packages backported from cooker :

* [http://jjorge.free.fr/packages/mandriva/kdenlive/rpms/i686/libmlt0.2.4-0.2.4-3mdv2007.1.i686.rpm libmlt0.2.4]

* [http://jjorge.free.fr/packages/mandriva/kdenlive/rpms/i686/mlt-0.2.4-3mdv2007.1.i686.rpm mlt-0.2.4]

* [http://jjorge.free.fr/packages/mandriva/kdenlive/rpms/i686/libmlt++0.2.4-0.2.2-7mdv2007.1.i686.rpm libmlt++0.2.4]

* [http://jjorge.free.fr/packages/mandriva/kdenlive/rpms/i686/kdenlive-0.5-3mdv2007.1.i686.rpm kdenlive-0.5]

Starting from Mandriva 2008.0, kdenlive 0.5 (i586/no MMX) is available directly in the distro, and can be installed using the control center. A slightly better version, correcting a bug with slideshows without luma transitions, and using MMX, is avaliable :

[http://jjorge.free.fr/packages/mandriva/2008.0/kdenlive-0.5-4mdv2008.0.i586.rpm kdenlive-0.5]

The source RPMS are there :

* [http://jjorge.free.fr/packages/mandriva/kdenlive/srpms/ SRPMS]

Using the media 'Backports' you can get an unstable version : Kdenlive 0.6 CVS. Be carefull, you should not use this version to daily work!

== Pardus ==

Pardus PiSi package of Kdenlive 0.5 is ready to install via Package Manager. You can type &quot;kdenlive &quot;in the search bar and click install button or you can install it from console.

 sudo pisi it kdenlive

If you want, you can compile Kdenlive from the svn repository, too.

 sudo pisi build http://svn.pardus.org.tr/pardus/2008/desktop/kde/kdenlive/pspec.xml
and
 sudo pisi it kdenlive*.pisi

== Slackware 12.0 ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Object Definition ==
A CORBA object is defined using the CORBA IDL programming language. CORBA IDL is pure definitions language, like, for example, UML. You only define the external interface and then choose an implementation language to actually implement your object.

There are many implementation languages available. The [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/idl2x_spec_catalog.htm OMG] alone defines [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/idl2x_spec_catalog.htm language mappings] for [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/ada_language_mapping.htm Ada], [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/c_language_mapping.htm C], [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/c++.htm C++], [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/cobol_language_mapping.htm COBOL], [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/omg_idl_to_java_language_mapping.htm Java], [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/lisp_language_mapping.htm Lisp], [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/pl1.htm PL/1], [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/python.htm Python] and [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/smalltalk_language_mapping.htm Smalltalk]. And there might be more.

However, some implementation languages make it easier than others to implement CORBA objects. In order to implement a CORBA object, the implementation's language needs to have a set of features which include object orientation, modules &lt;small&gt;(packages or namespaces)&lt;/small&gt;, and generics &lt;small&gt;(templates or dynamic typing)&lt;/small&gt;. If a language lacks any of those vital features, they have to be emulated. The language mapping provides those emulation layers for you, but it does not mean they are easy to use.

The differences are actually so large that it might be better to learn a new programming language with an easy mapping than use a known language with a particularly difficult mapping.

Another nice feature of the CORBA concept is that you don't need to use the object with the same programming language as the one the object is implemented in. So client and server may use different programming languages.

      <comment>/* Ada Implementation */ typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The echo object is a simple object with only one method. This method takes a single string parameter and returns that string unchanged.

== CORBA IDL definition ==
Any CORBA object needs to be defined in [[w:CORBA|CORBA]]'s [[w:Interface_description_language|Interface Definition Language]] (IDL). The IDL syntax is based on [[w:C_programming_language|C]]/[[w:C++|C++]] including the use of the [[w:C_preprocessor|C preprocessor]]. Hence we need the usual protection against a double include:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|test-echo.idl}}
&lt;source lang=idl&gt;
#ifndef  __TEST_ECHO_DEFINED
#define  __TEST_ECHO_DEFINED
&lt;/source&gt;
Next we define a module name. While not strictly needed for such a small example it is a good practice never to pollute the global namespace with classes and to use modules instead.
&lt;source lang=idl&gt;
 module Test
    {
&lt;/source&gt;
A class is called an &quot;interface&quot; in CORBA IDL. This should not be mixed up with interfaces in Ada or Java. A CORBA interface is the public part of the class &amp;mdash; the part of the class you can interface with. 
&lt;source lang=idl&gt;
    interface Echo
       {
&lt;/source&gt;
As said, we define just one method. It takes a string called ''Message'' as input parameter and returns a string as result.
&lt;source lang=idl&gt;
       string
       Echo_String (
          in string Message	
          );
 
       };
    // end interface Echo
 
    };
 // end module Test
 
 #endif
&lt;/source&gt;

== Ada Specification ==
Before you download the specification below you should try to call the following PolyORB command. It will generate an implementation template for you.

 idlac -i test-echo.idl

Most CORBA implementations will generate specification and implementation template files for the chosen implementation language. Which implementation languages you can choose from depends on your ORB. In our case it is [[Ada Programming|Ada]].

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|test-echo-impl.ads}}
&lt;source lang=ada&gt;
 with CORBA;
 with PortableServer;
&lt;/source&gt;
The CORBA module (Test) and class (Echo) is mapped to an Ada package hierarchy &amp;mdash; this is the normal way to do object oriented programming in Ada. The CORBA language mapping always tries to map close the implementation language. The Echo hierarchy contains several child packages which are fully generated and need no attention. Only the child package &quot;Impl&quot; contains the actual implementation of our Echo class and needs editing.
&lt;source lang=ada&gt;
 package Test.Echo.Impl
 is
&lt;/source&gt;

The type Object contains any data our class might want to store. However, all data stored is private, in fact all data in CORBA objects are private.
&lt;source lang=ada&gt;
    type Object
    is new
       PortableServer.Servant_Base
    with private;
 
    type Object_Ptr is access Object'Class;
&lt;/source&gt;

The Echo function is specified as a normal primitive operation to a normal Ada class.  If you are interested to know how Ada classes are declared you can read [[Ada Programming/Object Orientation]].
&lt;source lang=ada&gt;
    function Echo_String (
       --  The Object itself
       Self : access Object;
       --  The string which should be echoed.
       Message : in CORBA.String)
    return
       --  The returned string - which is the same as Message
       CORBA.String;
 
 private  
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, in the private section of the package, we could now declare data members for our class. However our simple echo class needs no data, so we just declare a &quot;null record&quot;. If you are interested to know what it would look like with data members you can read [[Ada Programming/Types/record]].
&lt;source lang=ada&gt;
    type Object
    is new
        PortableServer.Servant_Base
    with null record;
 
 end Test.Echo.Impl;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Ada Implementation ==
Now we know what the CORBA object looks like in Ada we have to actually implement the object. The implementation is a little more extensive than needed &amp;mdash; using PolyORB logging facility to produce diagnostic output.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following chapters describe the implementation of a simple CORBA object using [[w:PolyORB|PolyORB]] and [[w:Ada programming language|Ada]]. While the functionality is very simple the design itself is more extensive using modules, PolyORB's logging facility and meta classes giving you a better view of what is really needed in a client/server application.

While knowledge of [[Ada Programming|programming in Ada]] in particular is not needed, you should have knowledge of object oriented programming in general.

      <comment>/* Climate Change */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Climate==
Climate is a broad term, but it always describes a long-term average of a system. Often 'climate' is used to mean the long-term mean state of the atmosphere, including temperature, humidity, and wind. In other contexts, 'climate' can include the oceanic state, the cryosphere (snow and sea-ice), the biosphere, and sometimes even the lithosphere (Earth's crust). Meteorologists and atmospheric scientists often say that ''climate is what you expect; weather is what you get.''

Climatology, the science that studies climate, is a young science, with modern climate science only emerging from meteorology, oceanography, and geology in the late 20th Century. Of course, people have been interested in the natural world, including movements of air and water, for a very long time. One early example of a theory for anthropogenic climate change is George P. Marsh's{{ref|Marsh}} &quot;The Earth as Modified by Human Action,&quot; published in 1874. The science in this early effort is far from the level of climate science today, but Marsh does link land use change, including deforestation and irrigation, to changes in the local climate.

==Climate Change==
For the Earth's climate, changes in pasterns (moderate shifts in the mean values of the variables) are normal and expected. Earth's climate is a dynamic system, full of complicated processes that lead to chaotic variations, changes to external forcing of the system can lead to significant changes.

Usually we think of trends in global average quantities (especially surface temperature) as indicative of climate change. But when the trend leads to a change larger than the natural variability, a statistically significant change most certainly has occurred. [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;oi=defmore&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:climate+change DEFINITIONS]

This book will cover most of the normal implications of climate changes but will focus on the recent medium to long term effects on the above normal changes, normally but also confusingly labeled global warming.

The term global warming was coined by Wallace Broecker, a professor at Columbia University, in reference to the increase in the average temperature of Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-20th century and its projected continuation.

Reasons for this recent shift in the general pattern have been mostly stated as being the result of actions of the human species on the planet and solar variation.

;'''Anthropogenic Climate Change'''
Anthropogenic means &quot;human caused,&quot; form &quot;anthro-&quot;, meaning &quot;human,&quot; and 
&quot;genic,&quot; meaning &quot;produced by, origin, cause&quot;. The term anthropogenic climate change is used to attribute changes in Earth's climate to activities of humans. In recent times, this has been taken as implying mainly the emission of &quot;greenhouse gases&quot; into the atmosphere, usually by burning fossil fuels.

How can humans change Earth's climate? Even as far back as Arrhenius{{ref|Arrhenius}} people have been aware that the composition of the atmosphere affects the climate. Some gases, like carbon dioxide, have molecular structure that allows the absorption of certain wavelengths of light. In the case of &quot;greenhouse gases,&quot; that means absorbing infrared radiation. The distinguishing characteristic of a greenhouse gas is that it absorbs infrared radiation better than it does visible radiation; this allows sunlight to penetrate through the gas (the atmosphere) and warm Earth's surface. The Earth then radiates as a [[w:Black_body | blackbody]], emitting infrared radiation that is then trapped in the atmosphere. This is the greenhouse effect. 

If humans change the composition of the atmosphere, say by burning fossil fuels which release carbon dioxide, then more energy goes into the atmosphere than would have otherwise. More energy leads directly to higher temperature, hence climate change.

== Nomenclature ==

Within this wikibook, &quot;Climate Change&quot; is taken to primarily mean &quot;global warming&quot;; which is to say the warming of the Earth seen approximately since the start of the twentieth century. Of course, climate has changed before this time due to natural causes - for example the ice ages.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change defines climate change as ''a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |date=21 March 1994 |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1349.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense climate change is synonymous with global warming.

However the IPCC defines climate change as ''a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer). Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcings, or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.''

Whichever definition is used makes no difference to the changes in climate.


==A Wikibook digression==
One contributing author to this wiki book stated that decreased nocturnal cooling may never have been &quot;considered in any debate about global warming.&quot; The argument was stated as 
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;All planets with rotational days unequal to their orbital years absorb their sun's heat during their day and release it at night.  In the case of planet Earth, however, not only are we adding to the sun's heat in the daytime; The ever-increasing tendency away from regular day-night cycles of work, play and sleep means that at night, the time when our Earth should be shedding its excess heat, we are still adding to it.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

This is a fair argument at first blush, but it does not hold up under scrutiny. While Earth cools much more efficiently at night at the surface, the better cooling does not continue into the upper troposphere very well. That means that most of the energy from the cooling will still end up where it would during the day: either absorbed in the troposphere or emitted to space. Also, the argument seems to imply that increased nocturnal activity by humans makes the cooling less efficient, but it is an extremely small effect. The more efficient cooling at night is due almost entirely to the absence of sunlight. Think of the evolution of the surface temperature as dT = S - F to zeroth order, where S is the solar energy absorbed at the surface and F is the cooling by infrared emission. At nighttime, S = 0, so dT is all due to cooling by emission. During the day, the warming offsets the cooling. We are not adding to the sun's heat, as the contributor states, but just trapping it in the troposphere. That trapping has no diurnal cycle, since there is a negligible diurnal cycle in the concentration of atmospheric constituent gases. Let this be a lesson for the reader: critical thinking should always accompany learning about new topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nearly all the energy impacting Earth's climate comes from the sun, even if it is sometimes indirectly as we shall see.

The sun works as a thermonuclear engine, emitting energy that is released by fusion of hydrogen atoms in the sun's core. A complete description of the inner workings of the sun, including sun spots and the solar wind, are beyond the scope of this book. It is a topic worth reading about though, since the sun supplies the energy needed for life on Earth.

The photons (electromagnetic energy) emitted from the sun reach Earth's orbit in about 8 minutes. The temperature of the &quot;surface&quot; of the sun (the photosphere) is about 5700 K, and has been determined in many ways, including a simple calculation that is included below.  From conservation of energy, we can guess what happens. As the light travels away from the sun, it spreads out homogeneously over an expanding spherical shell, so a lot of energy gets spread over a huge area, so the concentration at any particular point decreases with distance from the sun. By the time the energy reaches Earth's orbit, the energy flux (energy per time per area) is only about 1367 W/m², the so-called solar constant. This single number is the beginning point for most of climatology, especially historically. 

Using the solar constant, we can calculate Earth's temperature if there were no atmosphere. To do so, we treat the Earth as a blackbody, which means that it is in radiative equilibrium, all the energy that it absorbs (that is, all the energy incident at its surface) is emitted. The [[w:Stefan-Boltzmann_law | Steffan-Boltzmann law]] law governs blackbody radiation, and can be stated as 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \sigma T^4\,&lt;/math&gt;
where the left-hand side is the flux, which is proportional to the temperature of the blackbody to the fourth power. The &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the Steffan-Boltzmann constant, which has a value approximately &lt;math&gt;5.67 \times 10^{-8} \text{W m}^{-2}\text{K}^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;. The energy flux incident at the Earth is the solar constant, but notice that the solar flux would not fall evenly on the surface of the planet. To account for this, note that the flux is spread uniformly over the projection of hemisphere facing the sun, that is the cross section, &lt;math&gt;\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;, but the energy (on average) is spread over the entire spherical surface, &lt;math&gt;4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;, giving a factor of 1/4. The temperature of this hypothetical Earth is then
:&lt;math&gt;T  = (1367/4 \sigma)^{-1/4} = 278.63 K&lt;/math&gt;

In Celsius, that is equal to 278.63 - 273.15 = 5.48 C. That's a very cold globally averaged surface temperature! Luckily, the presence of the atmosphere allows the Earth system to store somewhat more energy; the observed global average temperature is approximately 287 K (14 C), allowing a more comfortable existence for humans.

The light that reaches the sun arrives over a broad range of frequencies, but the peak frequencies are in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This can be shown by considering what we know already about the sun. For this exercise, two lengths are crucial, but can be measured quite well: the distance between the Earth and sun and the sun's radius. The average distance from the center of the sun to the center of the earth, which historically defined one astronomical unit, is about &lt;math&gt;1.496 \times 10^{11} \text{m}&lt;/math&gt;. The sun's equatorial radius is about &lt;math&gt;6.995 \times 10^8&lt;/math&gt; m{{ref|Sun}}. Combining these distances with the solar constant (&lt;math&gt;\Phi_E = 1367 W m^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;) can provide us with an estimate of the sun's effective surface temperature. To derive the temperature, consider the amount of energy reaching the distance from the sun to Earth, i.e. the solar constant. Since the sun is spherical and radiates in all directions, that amount of energy reaches the same distance on the whole surface area of a sphere, with radius of 1 AU, call this radius R. The surface area of this sphere is given by &lt;math&gt;4 \pi R^2&lt;/math&gt;. All this energy has to pass through the sphere defined by the radius of the sun as well, which means a shell with surface area &lt;math&gt;4 \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt; where r is the sun's radius. Because energy is conserved (it doesn't get created or destroyed between the sun and earth), the energy can be equated by 
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_E 4 \pi R^2 = \Phi_S 4 \pi r^2,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_S&lt;/math&gt; is the energy flux at the sun's surface. With that flux, the sun's effective surface temperature can be deduced by &lt;math&gt;T_{Sun} = (\Phi_S \sigma^{-1})^{-1/4}&lt;/math&gt;. Plug in the numbers! We find that &lt;math&gt;T_{Sun} = 5762&lt;/math&gt;K, which is very close to other estimates. Using [[w:Wien's_displacement_law | ''Wien's Displacement Law'']], we can determine the maximum emission wavelength at this temperature as &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{max} = b/T&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b = 2.897\times10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; mK and is called Wien's displacement constant. This wavelength, which comes out to about 503 nm, is the wavelength at which most of the sun's energy is emitted. This value is close to the middle of the visible part of the spectrum, which is why we see the sun as a yellow-orange color when we look at it. 

From this simple exercise, we deduce that the sun is close to a blackbody, which is confirmed observationally. What is the peak emission frequency from the Earth? What part of the spectrum is it in? To answer these questions, repeat the use of Wien's law above. The Earth emits at a much lower temperature, so a much longer wavelength, one that is thankfully invisible to human eyes (imagine how difficult it would be to see if the ground were like a lightbulb!).

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[../Sun's Influence on Earth/]], a simplified view of the Sun-Earth system
has been used. The results are correct, and show how simple physical
principles directly inform us about some of the most important aspects
ofthis view is
inadequate; this will become especially clear in the discussion of
paleoclimate (ancient climate) and ice ages. Here let us review a few
important aspects of the system to set the stage for later
discussions.

Perhaps the most profound influence on the Earth-Sun system is the
geometry involved. The most basic part of this geometry is the orbit
of Earth around the sun, which is governed by the gravitational
attraction between the two bodies. Kepler{{ref|Kepler}} showed that orbits are
ellipses, rather than perfect circles. Earth's orbit is slightly
elliptical, with an eccentricity of just 0.01671 {{ref|eccen}}; even
though this value is small, it has important consequences. The ''perihelion'', or smallest distance from the sun, occurs during the
northern hemisphere's winter and is about &lt;math&gt;1.47 \times 10^{11}
m&lt;/math&gt;, and ''aphelion'', the most distant point from the sun, is during
the northern hemisphere's summer and is about &lt;math&gt;152 \times 10^{11}
m.&lt;/math&gt; This difference does not cause Earth's seasons, but can
influence the severity of seasons (discussed in the paleoclimate
section) and does introduce small variations to the annual incoming
solar radiation (&quot;insolation&quot;) as there are very slow variations in
the eccentricity.

A second important effect to consider is the tilt of Earth's spin axis
with respect to the ''ecliptic plane'', which is basically the average
plane of Earth's orbit around the sun. The angle between the spin axis
and the perpendicular to the ecliptic plane is called Earth's
''obliquity'', and is currently about 23.4 degrees. This angle is the
primary reason for seasons on Earth, for as the planet traverses its
orbit, the amount of insolation at points on the surface slowly
change, with winter occurring when the pole faces away from the sun and
summer when the pole faces toward the sun. Seasons are more extreme
with larger obliquity, and high latitudes (e.g. Antarctica) experience
more extreme changes in insolation than the tropics, leading to more
pronounced season. Earth's obliquity slowly changes in time, which has
important consequences for very long-term climate change.

[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|right|300px|The ecliptic and its relation to rotation axis, plane of orbit and axial tilt.]]

A third important part of the Earth-sun geometry is called
''precession'', and is actually the combination of
parameters. Precession is the slow variation of direction of the spin
axis, and is affected by both a turning of the spin axis and a slow
change in the shape of Earth's orbit. For the contemporary climate,
the precession only matters because it determines the relative
position of the poles to the sun during Earth's orbit. There are
important consequences for long-term climate change, though, which
will be discussed later. 

The geometry of the Earth-sun system is a large part of the
astronomical basis for Earth's climate. Other astronomical factors
that are important include the evolution of the solar system and the
sun itself, as well as electromagnetic phenomena (e.g. the solar
wind). These topics are well worth studying, even in the context of
climate, but they are beyond the scope of this book, as they bear
little relevance on contemporary climate change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Sun-Earth System/]] should make it clear that the geometry of the
Sun-Earth system plays a key role in how much sunlight reaches Earth
and where it arrives. This section briefly describes the pattern of
incoming solar radiation, or insolation, over the course of the
year. This pattern is the direct result of the geometrical factors
described above, and since the insolation is the energy source for the
entire climate system, where the energy enters the system is of
fundamental importance to the subsequent distribution of energy. That
is to say, where the sun shines has a direct impact on weather and
climate. 

In an idealized system, where the orbit is circular and the planet's
spin axis is perpendicular to the ecliptic (i.e. obliquity equal to
zero), the problem becomes nearly trivial because every day is
identical. However, the spherical shape of the planet requires some
consideration. A first guess at why the poles of this hypothetical
planet are cold compared to the equator might be because the pole is
farther from the sun than the equator (by a distance equal to the
radius of the planet); in fact, this is a common mistake people make
about the real Earth as well. To convince us that this can not be the
case, consider the change in incoming energy in say 6800 km versus the
Earth-sun distance: it is minuscule. However, if we allow the solar
constant to be constant at the equator and the poles, there is still
an important effect of geometry, namely the angle between the incoming
photons (which we can think of as parallel rays of light) and the
direction normal to the surface (which can be thought of as the local
vertical direction, looking straight up, the sun is not always
overhead). The insolation is reduced by the cosine of this angle,
which is known as [[w:Lambert's cosine law|Lambert's cosine law]]. This is not an
atmospheric effect, but simply an optical one, so consider this the
insolation at the top of the atmosphere instead of the surface. The
principle is simply that the curvature of the Earth means that the
same radiance (or photon flux or sunshine) gets spread over a larger
area as the angle between the photons and the normal to the surface
increases from zero to 90 degrees at the poles. So even though the sun
is just as bright everywhere in the world, the power per area incident
at the top of the atmosphere changes as the sun appears lower in the
sky. The result is a modification to the local insolation, I, 
:&lt;math&gt; I(\phi) = S \cos(\phi), &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is latitude. 

Thus far, we have neglected Earth's spin. Of course, only half the
planet faces the sun at any instant in time. Consider a snapshot in
time. Half the planet faces the sun, half is in darkness. From
everyday experience, we know that the sun appears at different
distances above the horizon over the course of the day. At dawn, the
sun comes over the eastern horizon, traveling in an arc across the
sky, reaching its maximum height at local noon, and then descending toward the
western horizon. Let us define the ''zenith'' as the point directly
overhead; the angle from this zenith point to the sun's current
position is called the ''zenith angle''. In the hypothetical planet
described above, where seasons do not exist, the sun only appears
directly overhead along the equator at noon; moving away from the
equator, the sun sinks lower and lower toward the equatorward
horizon. At the south pole, the sun is just at the northward horizon
at local noon, providing essentially no insolation. Define a new
angle, that between Earth's equator and the highest local position of
the sun (the position at local noon), and call this the declination
angle; it is essentially a measure of the height above the horizon
that the sun will reach each day, and is equal to the latitude at
which the sun is directly overhead at noon. In the hypothetical world
above, the conditions are perpetually equinox, so the declination is
zero because the sun is overhead directly on the equator every
day. Earth's obliquity is about &lt;math&gt;23.45^\circ&lt;/math&gt; (0.409
radians), which combined with the Earth's revolution of 360 degrees
per 365 days provides an expression for the declination angle{{ref|Cooper}}{{ref|Fletcher}},
:&lt;math&gt; \delta = 23.45 \sin ( \frac{360}{365} (284 + N) ), &lt;/math&gt;
where N is the Julian day of the year. This expression is an
approximation, but will serve our purposes. 

[[Image:Insolation_daily_mean_lat_by_time.png|thumb|right|300px|The distribution of incoming solar radiation with current orbital parameters, averaged over each day. Notice polar night is shown by the dark blue regions, reaching to the Arctic and Antarctic circles at the solstices. This distribution is calculated from the equations in the section, and clipped at zero since negative insolation does not exist.]]

With the latitude and declination, an estimate of insolation can be
made given one additional piece of information related to the geometry
of the system: the time of day. The time of day is needed since it
affects the overall angle between the local vertical and the suns
rays, as is clear by noting the difference between night, dawn/sunset,
and noon. To describe the time of day, an additional angle in
introduced, conveniently denoted the &quot;hour angle,&quot;
:&lt;math&gt; H = 15^\circ * (LT - 12), &lt;/math&gt;
where, &lt;math&gt;15^\circ&lt;/math&gt; is the rotation rate (i.e.,
&lt;math&gt;360^\circ / 24 h&lt;/math&gt;) and LT is the local time. Note that at
local noon, H = 0. These calculations are normally done in radians,
but since most people more intuitively understand angles, we use them
here. 

Putting all these together, the actual solar zenith angle can be
described in terms of the above angles
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \cos^{-1} (\sin \phi  \sin \delta + \cos \phi \cos \delta
\cos H)&lt;/math&gt;
This relation can be derived without explicitly expressing the
declination and hour angles, purely from the geometry. These angles
make sense physically, so are included here.

Returning to Lambert's cosine law, we can write a simple expression
for the insolation: &lt;math&gt; I = S \cos Z &lt;/math&gt;. This describes the
flux of energy into the climate system at any particular moment, given
the location and time of day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have seen that the vast majority of energy in the climate system comes from the sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation, and most of that visible light. From the discussion of blackbody radiation, we saw that the emission temperature of Earth was much colder than the actually global mean temperature. It is the presence of the atmosphere -- because of its ability to absorb the emitted infrared radiation -- that the surface temperature is a much more comfortable temperature. This process is called the greenhouse effect (sometimes modified as the &quot;natural greenhouse effect&quot;). What is it that allows the atmosphere to absorb infrared radiation, and for that matter, why is it so transparent to visible radiation? 

To answer these questions completely requires a full treatment of radiative transfer and atmospheric chemistry, which are beyond the scope of this Wikibook. However, we can begin to understand these processes with basic physical principles. 

==Some topics to add==
* albedo - surface, cloud, ice, and snow
* infrared absorption - water vapor, carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases
* feedbacks - positive/negative, albedo, cloud, water vapor, vegetative, snow/ice

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{see also|w:Paleoclimatology}}

This section deals with climate and its variability on very long, geologic, time scales. These time scales are greater than centuries, and there are important millennial and multi-millennial signals in the so-called paleo record. Some research focuses exclusively on ancient climates; such work is often referred to as paleoclimatology (also paleoceanography or paleogeography). 

While a review of all relevant topics is beyond the scope of this Wikibook, some discussion of paleoclimate can shed light on the natural variability of the climate system. This includes not-so-distant climates, like that of the &quot;little ice age,&quot; and also the global-scale oscillations known as ice ages. At time scales even longer than ice ages (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years), there are large variations of climate associated more with geological processes than atmospheric and oceanic. While intensely interesting, these climates will be ignored here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Climate models come in many forms, from very simple energy-balance models to fully coupled, three dimensional atmosphere-ocean-land numerical models. As computers have become faster, climate science has advanced commensurately. The equations that govern how fluids move in time and space ([[w:Navier-Stokes_equations|Navier-Stokes Equations]]) are complicated to solve, and when all the scales of motion and physical processes (radiative transfer, precipitation, etc.) are incorporated, the resulting problem is impossible to carry out analytically. Instead, climate scientists turn these systems of equations into a series of computer programs. The resulting set of programs is, in some cases, a &quot;climate model.&quot; 

When the model is used to approximate the equations of motion on a sphere, it can be called a ''general circulation model'' (GCM). These are generic models, which can be specialized to simulate the ocean, atmosphere, or other fluid problems. Mostly because of limitations on computer power, these models do not resolve all scales of motion; instead a grid of points is established as an array of points where the equations are solved. Most modern atmospheric GCMs are run with horizontal grid spacing (distance between adjacent grid points) around 100 km, and with a number of vertical levels (usually around 30). The exact resolution depends on details of the model and the application. Because of this coarse grid spacing, small-scale (or &quot;sub-grid-scale&quot;) phenomena (like individual clouds or even hurricanes) are not explicitly resolved. For detailed calculations of smaller scales, more specialized numerical models are often employed, though there are some very high resolution GCMs (e.g. Japan's NICAM{{ref|Satoh}}). To incorporate the effects of sub-grid-scale phenomena, conventional GCMs rely on statistical rules, ''parameterizations'', that describe how the processes work on average given the conditions within the grid cell. Parameterizations can be very simple or very complicated, depending on the complexity of the process and the level of understanding of the statistical behavior of the process. Much of the improvement in GCMs today is directly related to improving parameterizations, either by incorporating more elaborate rules to match measured quantities better or by using more sophisticated theoretical arguments for how the physics should work.  

==Kinds of Models==
There are many classes of models, and within each class there are many implementations and variations. It is impossible to enumerate and describe every climate model that has ever been developed; even doing so for the published literature would be prohibitively difficult. In fact, there are entire volumes devoted to the history of numerical modeling of just the atmosphere; the American Institute of Physics has a brief description of AGCMs available online [http://www.aip.org/history/sloan/gcm/intro.html]. Here we discuss several classes of models, with an emphasis on atmospheric models. The discussion closely follows that of Henderson-Sellers and McGuffie (1987), which is an excellent resource on the subject (and has an updated edition). 

First of all, we restrict ourselves to numerical models, specifically those designed to be solved with computers. More generally, any equation or set of equations that represents the climate system is a climate model. Some of these can be solved analytically, but those are highly simplified models, which are sometimes incorporated in numerical models. 

The ultimate goal of climate models is to represent all physical processes that are important for the evolution of the climate system. This is a lofty goal, and will never truly be realized. The climate system contains important contributions and interactions among the lithosphere (the solid Earth), the biosphere (e.g., marine phytoplankton, tropical rainforests), atmospheric and oceanic chemistry (e.g., stratospheric ozone), and even molecular dynamics (e.g. radiative transfer). In fluid dynamics, some systems are now modeled using &quot;direct numerical simulation&quot; (DNS), in which (nearly) all the active scales are explicitly resolved. This is will never be feasible for the climate system. We cannot possible represent every atom in the climate system, it would essentially take the same number of electrons in the computer. Instead, climate modeling is limited to truly modeling the system; simplifying assumptions and empirical laws are used, the resolved motions are chosen to match the problem and/or the computing resources, and other processes are parameterized. However, these comprehensive climate models are not the only way to model the climate system.

Simpler models have been developed over the years for many reasons. One common reason historically was the computational cost of running large computers; simpler models have fewer processes to represent, and often have fewer space and time points (lower resolution). Two extremely simple classes of climate models are one-dimensional energy balance models and one-dimensional radiative-convective models. The single dimension in each is typically latitude (north-south direction) and altitude (vertical column), respectively.

A typical energy balance model (EBM) solves a small set of equations for the average temperature, T, as a function of latitude, &lt;math&gt; T(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;. These models were introduced in 1969 by Budyko and Sellers independently. They are solved for the equilibrium temperature at each latitude based on the incoming and outgoing radiative fluxes and the horizontal transport of energy. The radiative fluxes are simple schemes (usually) for the radiation reaching the surface, and often include some temperature dependent albedo (reflectivity) to represent ice-albedo feedback. The horizontal transport is typically given by an eddy diffusion term, which is just a coefficient multiplied by the meridional (north-south) temperature gradient. One of the most interesting aspects of these simple models is that they already produce multiple equilibria, having solutions for ice-free and ice-covered Earths as well as a more temperate solution (like the current climate). This result spurred much research in the sensitivity of the climate system.

Radiative-convective models (RCM) are essentially models of an atmospheric column. They can be used to represent the global average atmosphere, a particular latitude (zone), or a particular location. The resolved dimension is vertical, so all the horizontal fluxes (like winds and advected scalars like temperature and moisture) must be passed to the column somehow. The early RCMs (due largely to S. Manabe and colleagues) have a background temperature structure (lapse rate) and a treatment of radiative fluxes through he column. When the radiative heating of the column brings the lapse rate beyond a critical or threshold lapse rate, a &quot;convective adjustment&quot; is used to reduce the instability. Given constant boundary conditions, the model will equilibrate such that the energy budget is balanced, giving a model of the vertical (especially temperature) structure of the atmosphere. The early RCMs were used to explore the effects of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

There are also combinations of EBMs with RCMs that give a simple two-dimensional representation of radiative-convective equilibrium.

Another class of two-dimensional model is the axially symmetric model used, for example, by Held &amp; Hou (1980) and Lindzen &amp; Hou (1988). This is a dynamical model only, and has been used to study the meridional circulation in the absence of baroclinic eddies (midlatitude storm systems). While not truly climate models, these simple dynamical models have provided important theoretical understanding of the atmospheric circulation. 

In the ocean, there are simple box models that are somewhat analogous to the axially symmetric models of the meridional circulation of the atmosphere. These box models are traced back at least to Stommel, who used one to show the multiple equilibria of the thermohaline circulation in the Atlantic Ocean.

Other two-dimensional models also exist. For example there are simple equivalent barotropic models of the atmosphere. However these have mostly been used in numerical weather prediction and theoretical atmospheric dynamics. 

Occupying a higher region of the modeling hierarchy are three-dimensional numerical models. In terms of dynamics, these are usually fully turbulent fluids, and can be applied to spherical geometry or some simplied geometry like the beta-plane. This class of models should probably be divided into several subclasses. Some are coupled models (atmosphere + ocean, for example) while others only contain a single component of the climate system. Some are described as climate models of intermediate complexity, which covers a large range of models. 

At and around the top of the climate model hierarchy are general circulation models (GCM), sometimes called global climate models. These are fully three-dimensional representations of the atmosphere and/or ocean solved in spherical geometry. They are designed to conserve energy (1st law of thermodynamics), momentum (Newton's 2nd law of motion), mass (continuity equation), and (usually) moisture. We will discuss GCMs in much greater detail later, including the primary assumptions that they include, and the uncertainty associated with the results. GCMs are the best available tools for studying climate change.

==What Models Tell Us==


==What Uncertainty in Simulations Means==

Why can't climate models predict climate change perfectly? There are many answers to this question, and most of them are at least partly true! Here we briefly describe what is meant by &quot;uncertainty&quot; in climate modeling. 

Before starting to describe the uncertainty associated with climate models, it is important to emphasize that climate models are the best tools currently available for studying the climate of Earth and other planets. Although they are far from perfect, sophisticated climate models embody the physical processes thought to be important in the real climate. That there is some uncertainty most decidedly does not mean that we can't trust climate model results, nor does it mean there is built in &quot;wiggle room&quot; in the models.

Different climate models, and here we want to imply sophisticated numerical models (usually of the whole globle), get different results for the same experiment. These differences are due largely to different ways of representing physical processes that happen on scales smaller than the distance between model points. These processes are usually called sub-gridscale processes, and the representations for them in numerical models are known as parameterizations. The main idea of a parameterization is that uses information from the large scale, and infers (based on some rules) what is likely happening on smaller scales. A good example of this is wind near mountains. GCMs might have grid points only every 100 km, but mountain ranges can have very drastic elevation changes over much shorter distances. Rather than try to represent the scale of the mountains, which would be very hard with current computers, GCMs have a sub-gridscale topography parameterization. Depending on the details, it may affect the &quot;roughness&quot; of the surface or gravity waves induced by terrain, but the idea is the same, given that mountains change height on small scales, the GCM tries to model that behavior, at least to capture how mountains can affect the large-scale circulations the GCM does resolve. Since parameterizations are different, and given the large number of parameterized processes, it is no wonder GCMs get different results. The fact that the results are not more different is a testament to our current level of understanding of climate processes.

Imagine taking a large number of GCMs and running them all the same way. For example, the IPCC had modeling centers around the world run the same experiments (basically increasing CO2 concentration) to compare each model's climate response. Because the models are built differently, in some cases the are very fundamental differences between models, the results vary from model to model. If we just take the climate response, for example the change in surface air temperature for a given change in radiative forcing, from each model and find the average and standard deviation, that gives us an estimate of the &quot;uncertainty&quot; in the climate response. This is done in lieu of a real experiment because we only have one Earth, and definitely not enough time to run so many experiments!

The above method gives a measure of expected climate response based on very different models. Another method is to use the same GCM, but slightly change parameters or even parameterizations to determine the strength of different processes. As a simple example, imagine that some GCM uses a single value for the albedo (reflectivity) of stratocumulus clouds. If the GCM is run ten times, each with a different value for that parameter, the results of a climate change experiment will change. How much the results differ will determine that GCM's sensitivity to stratocumulus albedo. This gives another measure of &quot;uncertainty,&quot; since that model assumes there is only one value of the albedo, which may not be true in the real atmosphere. The distributed computing project ClimatePrediction.net uses such a methodology to study processes important to climate sensitivity.

Another answer to our original question is that the system is not perfectly predictable. The climate system is chaotic, or at least &quot;sensitive to initial data.&quot; This just means that we know the equations that govern fluid motion, and we have a pretty good idea of the physical processes that need to be included, but the system of equations has many solutions, and even if the system is perfectly deterministic (no random fluctuations), unless we also perfectly know the initial conditions, we may not get the right answer. In fact, in chaotic systems it has been shown that arbitrarily small errors in the initial conditions can give wildly different results after some amount of time. While the case of Earth's climate is unlikely to be that sensitive, it does mean that we shouldn't expect a perfect long-term (greater than 2 weeks) weather forecast to be on the local television station any time soon (or ever). Note that the science of climate prediction differs fundamentally from that of weather prediction. In weather prediction, the sensitivity to initial conditions is a basic limitation, as perfect knowledge of initial conditions is impossible. Climate models are not sensitive to initial condition; the problem changes from an ''initial-value problem'' to a ''boundary-value problem''.

*Sedimentary rocks: The presence of sedimentary rocks is direct evidence of ancient climatic change. The atmosphere slowly developed in its current composition from very different states related to geology and biology. Geological processes, especially weathering due to wind and rain, helped transform primary igneous rocks to sediments. Those sediments are deposited downstream, and over time they are compacted and form sedimentary rocks. Tectonic activity can also contribute to the process, acting to accelerate compaction of sediment.      
* lake sediments
* ocean floor sediments
Tectonic activity has been an abundant source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for our earth's history. A single volcanic event can transfer as much carbon dioxide to our atmosphere as our whole nation's output for a year.  This tectonic phenomenae is credited for the creation of our original atmosphere.  A case can be made that the Earth's carbon is simply recycled from original volcanic origin to life forms and then later to limestone in sedimentary rock accumulations.  Vast deposits of limestone are known from the Paleozoic era.  Increased carbon dioxide in our atmosphere may result in an increase of limestone deposition in our oceans.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Climate change has become a &quot;hot button&quot; issue over the past few years, and this has only become more extreme as United States policy on climate change has diverged from much of the rest of the world and the scientific community. However, climate change is first and foremost a scientific topic. In this wikibook, the underlying science of climate change is explored in some detail. The study of climate -- sometimes called climatology or climate science -- is actually a relatively young field, but has roots in all the major branches of science. It is most easily associated with atmospheric science (and its older name, [[Meteorology]]) and oceanography. There are also strong connections with the cryosphere (glaciology), the biosphere (biology, ecology), and the lithosphere (especially through the extraction and combustion of fossil fuels). Using basic physical principles, the science of climate change and these connections to other natural sciences will emerge. We will see how computer models, current observation, and studies of ancient climates converge on a singular picture of the near future that includes continued global warming, enhancement of the hydrological cycle, decreasing sea-ice, shrinking glaciers and ice sheets, more acidic ocean water, rising sea level, and more frequent extreme climate events. 

Many of the fundamental concepts of climate science are straight out of elementary physics. The equations of motion are the same fundamental equations that govern all classical fluid dynamics, much of energy transfer is based on well-known principles of radiative transfer and nuclear physics and spectrometry, and a lot of observations are based on geological, chemical and biological processes and methods. This is all to say that climate science is a multi-disciplinary field, with diverse (even disparate at times) interests and applications. It is unified only by the end goal: to understand the physical processes governing our natural world. These same physical principles are at work in understanding a changing climate. The main difference is that instead of describing the average or the natural variability of climate, climate change studies try to quantify differences or trends. Past changes and future changes are studied similarly, though sometimes using different tools, as we will see. 

When the composition of the atmosphere changes, for example by changing the carbon dioxide concentration, the radiative properties of the atmosphere might also change. In the absence of an atmosphere, Earth would look a lot like a black body radiator; that is to say, the sun would shine on Earth, which would warm to an equilibrium temperature, and then a balance would be struck. That balance (radiative equilibrium) would have Earth radiating as much energy to space as the sun delivers to the surface. Mostly due to the fact that Earth is so small and intercepts so little of the total energy emitted from the sun, that radiative equilibrium temperature is much lower than the sun's temperature. Using Wien's law, we can calculate that temperature and establish that Earth is an infrared emitter. 

When there is an atmosphere, like the one on Earth, some of the gases that make up the atmosphere can absorb infrared radiation. That interaction between photons and molecules increases the temperature of the atmosphere, which then emits at a slightly different wavelength. The emission from the atmosphere goes both out to space and downward, back to the ground where it is absorbed by the surface. This process, whereby energy that is emitted from the surface is absorbed by the atmosphere which then emits energy back toward the surface, is called the greenhouse effect, and it is one of the basic feedback processes in the climate system. It increases the surface temperature on Earth from the radiative equilibrium temperature to a much more life-friendly temperature. Global warming, or anthropogenic global warming, is the difference in the global mean temperature in a world with artificially elevated carbon dioxide compared to a reference state (which is usually taken as a time before the Industrial Revolution). In the rest of this part of the book, we investigate the processes involved with climate and climate change, from the sun's influence, to the natural greenhouse effect, to observed changes in the composition of the atmosphere. We will focus on feedbacks and processes that are thought important in both stabilizing and amplifying changes to the global climate.

By using various methods of chemistry, geology, and even astronomy, past climate variations are well known. These include the relatively periodic ice ages of the past 2-million years as well as more exotic climates from the Cretaceous and other eras. On such long timescales the main reasons for climate changes must be linked to changes in the sunlight reaching Earth (insolation), major shifts in ocean heat transport, or &quot;external&quot; forcing like volcanism or meteor impacts. More recently, human-induced changes (anthropogenic) are likely a strong climate forcing. Much research has focused on quantifying Earth's climate and its variability over the past 30 years or more. It has been shown that the globally averaged surface temperature is now warmer than it has been for at least 150 years. The trend in surface temperature is remarkably well correlated with a trend in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The current trends are increasing, and the warmest years on record are in the last decade. [http://www.ipcc.ch IPCC]

In fact, according to data compiled by NOAA, 2012 ranks 10th warmest since records began in 1880 [http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2012/13]. The global surface temperature was estimated to be 14.47°C (0.57°C above the 20th Century average of 13.9°C). Amazingly, 2012 was the 36th consecutive year that the yearly global temperature was above average, meaning that more than half the people in the world have never experienced a (globally) average year (median age is 28.4 years, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2177.html]). 

The global average surface temperature continues to rise, but not every year is the warmest year ever. There are variations in the global average surface temperature. These variations are caused by small deviations in the radiative forcing or fluctuations in the rate of heat absorption by the deep ocean. The long-term trend provides a measure of the rate of warming. Putting a linear trend line through the observations of the late 20th Century and early 21st Century provides an estimate of 0.13 °C [0.10 to 0.16 °C] per decade according to the IPCC AR4.

Earth is now absorbing 0.85±0.15 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; more energy from the Sun than it is emitting to space. ([http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/308/5727/1431?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=James+Hansen&amp;searchid=1133830768748_23288&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0 Hansen et al, 2005, Science vol 308])

[[File:Hadcrut3 temperature anomaly 2000-2009.png|thumb|Average temperature anomaly from the HadCRUT3 dataset for the decade 2000-2009. Anomaly is relative to the absolute temperature during the base period 1961-1990.]]

The map at right shows an expression of the directly measured temperature change. It shows the temperature anomaly map averaged over the ten years spanning 2000 to 2009 in Kelvin (a centigrade scale, just like Celsius). These anomalies are with respect to the 1961 to 1990 base period. The measurements that go into the HadCRUT3 data set include observations over land from more than 3000 weather stations on at least a monthly basis. For ocean areas, ship-based measurements are used, details are included in published papers (Jones &amp; Moberg 2003 and Rayner set al. 2003). 

[[File:Hadcrut3 time series.png|thumb|Time series of global temperature anomaly from HadCRUT3 data set. Anomaly is with respect to 1961-1990 base period. Individual months are shown by gray dots, and an orange line shows a 10-year running average. ]]

The time series from the HadCRUT3 data set is also shown at right. While temperature anomalies are fairly uniform in the late 19th Century, the 20th Century shows a strong upward trend. The trend is divided into an early rise from around 1900 to about 1940 followed by a period of little warming (and some cooling) until the 1970s and then a rapid rise from before 1980 until present. These three periods are understood as being driven by different forcing agents. The early 20th Century warming was caused by both increasing carbon dioxide and increasing solar activity. The mid-century cooling and stable period follow rapid industrialization and World War II, and the industrial activity following the war injected an abundance of particles into the atmosphere. These particles, called aerosol, reflect sunlight, which lead to a so-called &quot;global dimming&quot; which decreased the sunlight reaching the surface, thereby reducing the global temperature. The later warming, after 1980 or so is dominated by carbon dioxide, which became a stronger forcing agent than the dimming aerosol as air pollution became more strongly regulated while carbon dioxide continued to rise. (reference [[http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-cooling-mid-20th-century.htm]])

The analysis of these global patterns of temperature change really brings out the fact that many factors contribute to the global average temperature. A sub-discipline of climatology has emerged that tries to quantify the contributions of various factors to observed climate change; this field is often put into a category called attribution studies. A recent example is [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/6/4/044022| Foster &amp; Rahmstorf (2011)], that attempts to remove natural factors from the late 20th-early 21st Century climate records. They are able to account for factors such as ENSO, volcanos, and solar variability, leaving the remainder of the trend explained by human-caused factors. Their conclusion is that nearly all of the observed temperature trend is associated with radiative forcing that is ultimately due to rising carbon dioxide concentrations that come from burning fossil fuel. 

While the above examples show evidence for the temperature change in the 20th Century, recent climate change is expressed in numerous other climatic indicators. One example is the extent of Arctic sea-ice. As the climate has changed over the past few decades, there has been an unprecedented decline in the area covered by sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean, especially late in the warm season which is also the sea-ice melt season ( [[dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10581|Kinnard et al. 2011]] ). The most direct way available to track these changes uses satellite observations. The figure at the right shows observed Arctic sea-ice concentration (in percent) for September 1979 and September 2010 from a set of passive microwave observations [[http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0051.html| NSIDC]] These two months show an example of the change in coverage of sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean: September 2010 shows substantially less ice than 1979. September is the end of the melt-season, so these maps are an illustration of the minimum sea-ice coverage in these years. The time series below the maps show the monthly mean sea-ice extent from late 1978 through 2010. Sea-ice extent is the area covered by sea-ice concentration of at least 15%. The annual cycle of sea-ice extent is quite large, oscillating between 15 and 6 million square kilometers in most years. Looking at a particular month shows the long-term trend more obviously. The blue line in the time series plot highlights September sea-ice extent, and it is clear that there is a decline in the September sea-ice minimum. Both the concentration and the extent are an expression of the area covered by ice, but at least as important is the volume of sea-ice. Observations show a pronounced decline in sea-ice volume, similar to the decline in sea-ice extent. The volume is decreasing in the winter months even more strongly than the extent is; this is because the ice that forms in the winter is thin and has less and less volume as the thick ice (that survives through the summer) disappears.
[[File:Sea Ice Changes through time.png|thumb|Sea-ice concentration in September of 1979 and 2010 (top panels) and time series of sea-ice extent (bottom). The blue line in the bottom panel highlights September of each year and the long-term trend. ]]

Another indicator of the changing climate is the change in global sea level that has been observed over the last several decades. There are two main effects that are important for the global mean sea-level change. First, as the near-surface temperature increases, heat flows into the ocean's surface waters. As the water temperature rises, the water slightly expands, similar to other materials. This direct temperature effect is called the steric effect on sea-level. The second major factor is the change in the mass balance of the oceans. As the climate has warmed, ice that has been sequestered on land as ice has begun to melt. Much of this melted ice has found its way to the sea, either directly as in the case of calving of ice from Greenland and Antarctic or by making its way to the ocean via streams and rivers. Recent estimates suggest that these two effects combine to account for a long-term trend in sea-level that is more than 3 mm of sea-level rise per year. [http://sealevel.colorado.edu]

Some of the observed evidence that Earth's climate is changing:
* Global Temperatures are Rising
* Melting Glaciers
* Sea Levels Rising
* Weather patterns are become more difficult to predict
* Seasonality of weather and temperatures are changing

Many believe that &lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt; and other greenhouse gases (chlorofluorocarbons, methane, sulfur hexafluoride) cause global warming. 

* Observed trend in global mean surface temperature
* Observed radiative imbalance at top-of-atmosphere
* Rising atmospheric concentration of &lt;math&gt;CO_2&lt;/math&gt;
* Rising sea level due to thermal expansion of sea-water.

==Criticism==
Some people, for a variety of reasons, claim to have found faults with the hypothesis that humans are affecting Earth's climate. While we strive to present any legitimate criticism of the scientific principles where they are presented, this section includes some specific issues that are commonly cited as reasons that humans are not or could not change the climate. 

* Lack of scientific consensus
:One of the most common arguments against human induced climate change is a supposed lack of scientific consensus. While there were many skeptical scientists in the past, as the evidence has mounted (especially using satellite-based data), even the most ardent skeptics have come to the determination that humans are changing the climate. One recent study found no instances in the peer-reviewed literature of a study on climate change stating that global warming is either fictitious or purely natural [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686 Oreskes, N., Science, 2004, 306(5702), DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618]. See also [[/Scientific Consensus/]].
* The Earth's surface obtains energy from four primary natural sources:  space (predominantly solar radiation), the molten core of the Earth, anthropogenic processes that generate excess heat, and radiation from the atmosphere. The second (geothermal heat) is known to be trivially small; the third (direct excess heat) is not as important as increases in the fourth, the energy retention (called the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;), that is the property of retention heat that could be lost to space due to changes in the atmosphere or surface characteristics, this retention today is mostly due to increases in CO2 levels and receding reflective surfaces like ice or snow. So while indications seems to point to human activities and it is nice to think that changing our energy consumption habits will stop global warming, consideration is needed to account that climate change can be driven by processes that we may have little control over.  
{{NOTE|Solar radiation normally varies over time as the orbit of the earth changes due to gravitational inter-action with the other planets and the sun. When the Earth's orbit gets more elliptical and most of the land mass is in a seasonal orbital position so it is receiving more direct radiant energy from the sun (or it is summer for most of the land mass when the orbit brings it nearest the sun), then an inter-glacial period usually occurs. Those combining planetary science with geologic evidence have significant findings suggesting that our present inter-glacial period may have not peaked. Some pointing to an inter-glacial period about 400,000 years ago that had about 1/3 of the ice on the Antarctic gone when it peaked, as having the most similar pattern of orbits for the planets when compared to the orbits now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Also note that the current configuration actually has Earth closest to the sun during northern hemisphere winter, and not summer. Seasons are not due to the eccentricity (how &quot;oval&quot; the orbit is), but really much more on the tilt of the spin axis of Earth (obliquity). There is a precession signal as well, which is influenced by the sun-earth distance, but that signal is more directly linked to the Tropics.}}
* Others, like Bill Ruddiman (U VA) think that we are overdue for an ice age, based on orbital parameters.

** Predicted Surface temperature over land increases more than over ocean.
** Global mean precipitation increases, with a larger increase over the ocean.
** Melting ice is going to make sea levels rise, thus contributing among other things to alterations of precipitation patterns.
** Regional temperature and salinity changes.
** Sea level rises, mostly due to thermal expansion of ocean water.
** Alteration of the plant life growth cycles.

==Possible effects on humans==
* Increased incidences of respiratory infections, malaria, and other diseases.
* Changing growing seasons lead to bad harvests and widespread food shortages
* Increased droughts cause regional water shortages
* Sea levels rise more than expected (&gt;1m), displacing millions of people
* More frequent flooding leads to coastal destruction in developing nations, increasing the spread of diseases locally.
* Due to the reduction of the high atmosphere braking effect on low orbital bodies, the use of low orbit for satellites due to the general general increase in the time for the natural degradation leading to burn out will create a higher right to space missions.

==Worst-case scenario outcomes==
* Release of methane clathrate from ocean bottom releases enormous amounts of methane to atmosphere, leading to runaway greenhouse effect
* Thawing tundra releases methane trapped in permanently frozen organic matter, leading to enhanced warming
* Increases in precipitation over Greenland, combined with other warming effects there, leads to pools of liquid water that melt into the ice sheet as moulins. Liquid water gets deep into the ice sheet, lubricating and destabilizing it, and huge discharges of ice spill into the north Atlantic.
* Huge discharges of ice spill into the north Atlantic, chilling and freshening the surface water, stabilizing the upper ocean. This shuts down deep convection, and we experience a rapid climate change (not quite so fast as ''[[w:The Day After Tomorrow|The Day After Tomorrow]]'').

This was a well developed chapter review. I especially like the conclusion / summery you provided at the beginning of the sections. One thing you might want to try is designating which questions came from which content articles. This way the reader can easily go back and reread the section that they did poorly on. Overall, great job![[User:Scrai010|Scrai010]] ([[User talk:Scrai010|talk]]) 01:52, 10 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Explain POD</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=&lt;center&gt;Boost mutant&lt;/center&gt;=
=== Intent ===
Reverse a pair of plain old data (POD) types without physically reorganizing or copying the data items.

=== Also Known As ===

=== Motivation ===
The need of this idiom is best motivated using the [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/bimap/doc/html/index.html Boost.Bimap] data structure. Boost.Bimap is a bidirectional maps library for C++. In bimap&lt;X,Y&gt;, values of types X and Y both can serve as keys. The implementation of such a data structure can be optimized using the boost mutant idiom. 

=== Solution and Sample Code ===
Boost mutant idiom makes use of ''reinterpret_cast'' and depends heavily on assumption that the memory layouts of two different structures with identical data members (types and order) are interchangeable. Although the C++ standard does not guarantee this property, virtually all the compilers satisfy it. Moreover, the mutant idiom is standard if only POD types are used.&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/bimap/test/test_mutant.cpp&lt;/ref&gt; The following example shows how boost mutant idiom works.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
template &lt;class Pair&gt;
struct Reverse
{
    typedef typename Pair::first_type  second_type;
    typedef typename Pair::second_type first_type;
    second_type second;
    first_type first;
};

template &lt;class Pair&gt;
Reverse&lt;Pair&gt; &amp; mutate(Pair &amp; p)
{
  return reinterpret_cast&lt;Reverse&lt;Pair&gt; &amp;&gt;(p);
}

int main(void)
{
  std::pair&lt;double, int&gt; p(1.34, 5);

  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;p.first = &quot; &lt;&lt; p.first &lt;&lt; &quot;, p.second = &quot;  &lt;&lt; p.second &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;mutate(p).first = &quot; &lt;&lt; mutate(p).first &lt;&lt; &quot;, mutate(p).second = &quot;  &lt;&lt; mutate(p).second &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Given a &lt;code&gt;std::pair&lt;X,Y&gt;&lt;/code&gt; object of POD data members only, the layout of the &lt;code&gt;Reverse&lt;std::pair&lt;X,Y&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is identical to that of pair's on most compilers. The &lt;code&gt;Reverse&lt;/code&gt; template reverses the names of the data members without physically reversing the data. A helper &lt;code&gt;mutate&lt;/code&gt; function is used to easily construct a &lt;code&gt;Reverse&lt;Pair&gt;&lt;/code&gt; reference, which can be considered as a ''view'' over the original pair object. The output of the above program confirms that the reverse view can be obtained without reorganizing data:

p.first = 1.34, p.second = 5

mutate(p).first = 5, mutate(p).second = 1.34

=== Known Uses ===
*  [http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/bimap/doc/html/index.html Boost.Bimap]

=== Related Idioms ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">===DEFINITION OF SIN===
The essential principle of sin is selfishness.  It is the love of self as opposed to the love of God.  This may have its outworking in many ways, but each of these individual ways is our own way, and not His way.  This applies to that which is apparently good as well as that which is obviously wrong.  There is no difference with God.
&quot;All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned, every one, to his own way;&quot;   Isaiah 53: 6

Our own way in independence from Yahweh is the essence of original sin - Adam's sin, of which we have all partaken and for which Messiah died, taking upon Himself the iniquity of us all.

&quot;By one man sin entered the world  ..   ..   thus death spread to all men, because all sinned&quot;  Romans 5:12

&quot;He died for all that they ..  .. should no longer live for themselves, but for Him  ..   &quot;  2 Corinthians 5:15

The following are the main words used for sinfulness and various acts of sin in the New Covenant.


1.  SIN  -   Greek  -   HAMARTIA.	This is the most common word used in the scriptures for sin and it means missing the mark. i.e. falling short of the standard.  Failing to be what we should 	be.  Falling short of what Yahweh created us to be. It relates to original sin in us.  It was not an ethnic word in Greek, but one used in shooting for missing a target.

&quot;For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God&quot;   Romans 3:23


2. TRANSGRESSION  -  PARABASIS  A stepping by the side, a deviation, a violation of the law.  It is stepping over the line from right to wrong,  going into forbidden territory.	

&quot;What purpose then does the law serve?   It was added because of transgressions&quot;   Galatians 3:19


3. INIQUITY   -    ANOMIA	Without law, not subject to law, violating the law, lawless.
'Nomos' means 'law', and one practicing iniquity is one who deliberately disobeys God's law. This word emphasises the deliberate flaunting of Yahweh's laws.  Lawlessness is not being subject to God's laws, it is knowing the law and not doing it.

&quot;Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness&quot;    Matthew 7:23


4. DISOBEDIENCE   -    PARAKOE  An erroneous or imperfect hearing.  A deviation from obedience.
This verb meant to &quot;mishear, or to fail to hear&quot;. It could be said of one who did not catch something because it was not clear, or his own hearing impaired.  Then it came to mean, deliberately closing the ears to God in order to listen to oneself.
	
&quot;By one man's disobedience many were made sinners&quot;   Romans 5:19


5.  TRESPASS   -   PARAPTOMA   A falling aside, a deviation from the right path. This word describes a slip as when one is caught offguard, when he is not looking where he is going, when he takes his eyes off the goal. It is a failure in concentration, a failure in self-control by which a man slips into sin.

&quot;And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins&quot;  Ephesians 2: 1


6.  UNGODLINESS  -  ASEBEIA   Impiety, wickedness.  This is the disregard for God, as if He did not exist.
Godlessness knows there is a God, but disregards Him.
&quot;The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness&quot; Rom.1:18


7.  UNRIGHTEOUSNESS  -  ADIKIA  Injustice, wrong falsehood,deceitfulness.  It is the failure to do right  to God and man.  We are to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts  Titus 2:11,12

&quot;All unrighteousness is sin&quot;    1 John 5:17

These acts of sin are the outworking of our sinful state, which is our state of independence from Yahweh.  We break His laws because we are going our own way and living to please self.  That which may appear right and good, if originating from our own motivations to satisfy our own needs, still comes into the category of the nature of sin as it comes out of a life lived in independence from our Creator and His purposes.


===THE ORIGIN OF SIN===
:::  -  Historically
&quot;Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world,  and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.&quot;   Romans 5:12

The original sin was in the Garden when Adam yielded to the temptation of the enemy.
All of Adam's progeny were born in that state of 'death' which God had predicted would be the result if he disobeyed His commandment.  Genesis 2:16, 17

In the Hebrew the word used for 'dying' actually means 'dying you shall die'.   That is death by a process of dying.  Man died spiritually first - that was immediate separation from Yahweh on a spiritual level.  Then the process of death began in deterioration of the soul and body to finally end in physical death.

All men since are born without the real essence of life within, which is this state of death.  What remained, was but a shadow of what had been.  Man basically was an empty shell needing to be filled, he was without a source of life.  Therefore man seeks to fill the empty void with some 'thing'  (whether person/idol, activity, pleasure or work) which will give satisfaction and fill the void in his life.  Self-seeking, covetous and subject to futility, the result is external acts of sin.

===THE ORIGIN OF SIN===
::: - Individually
&quot;Every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own desires and enticed.  Then when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.&quot;    James 1:14-15	     Because,
&quot;The wages/penalty of sin is death&quot;   Romans 6:23

&quot;For all that is in the world - the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life - is not of the Father but is of the world&quot;   1 John 2:16,17

Adam originally was God-centered, but after the fall, mankind became self-centered and his orientation was in the things of this world which occupied his life.

&quot;If then you were raised (in baptism) with Messiah, seek those things which are above where Messiah sits on the right hand of God.  Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth.  For you died, and your life is hidden with Messiah in God&quot;  

&quot;Therefore put to death your members which are upon earth  ..   ..  &quot;   Colossians  3: 1-3, 5
	
Things to put to death  -   Fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, covetousness, anger, wrath, malice, filthy language and lying.   Colossians 3: 5-9

Things to put on    -    Tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering, tolerance, forgiveness 	and love with 	the peace of God ruling in your heart, being thankful - having His Word dwelling in you richly.  Colossians 3:12-16 

Failure to keep one's mind/affection, the centre of one's heart and life on the things above, the things of the kingdom, will result in the earthly, sensual nature taking over and we will either slip up or deliberately sin.

&quot;But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness&quot;  Matthew 6:33
	
===ORIGINAL STATE OF MAN===
When Yahweh created man He had a purpose and plan for his life, to raise him to a maturity of sonship in the perfection of His own life and character.  This was the desire of the Father's heart. The necessary condition for this to be effected was that Adam live in a faith relationship wherein he completely trusted and relied upon His spiritual Father, obeying His Word.

&quot;What is man that You are mindful of him,   ..  ...  ?
For you have made him a little lower than the angels, and You have crowned him with glory and honour&quot;

And set him over the works of your hands ..  &quot;   Psalm 8: 4-5

Adam was given the dominion of all things and the task of bringing it into subjection to the Father (Gen1:28  to subdue it)   The ultimate fulfilment of this was in the Son of man, Y'shua, who is the second Adam.   Hebrews 2: 5-13 &amp; 1 Corinthians 15:28.   Y'shua lived in that perfect dependence and reliance upon the Father and became the first of a new order, the Son of Man.  He passed the test wherein the first Adam failed, and as well as passing the test, purchased back the lost dominion and brought many other sons into glory.   
He said, &quot;And the glory which you gave Me, I have given them&quot;   John 17:22 

Adam created in Yahweh's image and likeness, was a creature of glory and honour.  He was created with an impartation of  the glory of  God, we now fall short of that stature of glory (Romans 3:23).   He was 'crowned' with glory and honour.    And the glory and honour which he was given was according to the high calling of the kingly status of ruling the whole earth and bringing it into subjection to the Father. John seeing a glorified saint fell at his feet in awe (Revelation 19:10), such was the majesty of this one who had been restored to the glory intended in the original creation.

When Adam was stripped of the glory he felt completely naked.  He lost the glorious garments of light which covered him and needed an earthly covering according to his now earthly state. (Genesis 3: 7,8, 15).  Having been created in the 'likeness' of Yahweh  he was clothed with His righteousness in garments of light and glory (Psalm 104:1-2), as are the resurrected saints and angels seen in the book of Revelation.    

Adam's original state of nakedness was physical only (Genesis 2:25), but after the fall he also became spiritually naked (Genesis 3:7).   Two different terms are used to denote two different states of nakedness, the first was physical only.
(In Genesis 2:25 the Hebrew word AROM 6172 means bare,  but not &quot;ashamed&quot; i.e. not in a state of inner shame or guilt.
     
But in Genesis 3: 7, 10, 11, a different word is used - EROM 5903 which the Theological Wordbook says &quot;is used to  denote spiritual  and physical nakedness&quot;). 
   
In his exalted state Adam communed face to face with Yahweh in the 'cool of the day' or as in the Hebrew 'in the ruach of the day' - when the Spirit of God moved upon the earth at evening.  He was in perfect accord, one in heart and mind with the Godhead, and in that fellowship of love and truth the Spirit of God filled him with all wisdom and knowledge in accordance with his progressive level of spiritual growth, in that school of the Spirit.

What a deception the enemy presented when he said &quot;You shall be as gods&quot;   Genesis 3:5

Pre-empting the plan of Yahweh and taking them by a counterfeit way   John 14: 6

===FALLEN STATE OF MAN===
The original sin of man was to choose to be as 'god' by knowing good and evil.  That is, to be a source in himself of making the decisions for himself based upon his own knowledge. Man by choice of disobedience became another source of decision-making, an independent will.
By that choice he became separated from the life of God, which was his life-source and he died from the inside out. Man died in his spirit, which was the part of himself through which he had relationship with Yahweh.  Man had subjected himself to, and placed himself under the dominion of Satan in the realm of his 'flesh'. Thereafter 'flesh' ruled and he was a law unto himself.

Dead works are the deeds and actions of a life lived apart from the living God.  They may be religious works, social activities or humanistic programmes, self-righteous works, hypocritical actions or outright evil deeds, but whatever, all acts of a man in himself, if they do not originate out of relationship with Yahweh, are &quot;dead works&quot;.
&quot;Whatsoever is not of faith is sin&quot; (Romans 14:23)  -   That is, whatever is not born out of our faith-union with the Father but rather originates out of our own motivation, is sin.

Y'shua said,  &quot;I do always those things that please the Father&quot;  John 6:46

and, &quot;I do nothing of Myself&quot;   John 8:28

Dead works keep alive a consciousness of sin.  Only the Blood of Y'shua can purge our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.  Hebrews 9:14

Once we are freed from these we can enter the rest of faith  -  Hebrews 4:10

We then have confidence toward God  to come before Him  -  Hebrews 10:22

Restoration to sonship with our Heavenly Father is the outcome of turning from sin through the mediatorial work of the Son of God, our Messiah.  We need to repent from all 'dead works'  -  all acts that are life-less, that is,  devoid of the empowering of His life.   And, let us look unto Y'shua the author and the finisher of our faith, who for the joy that He saw set before Him of receiving many sons to glory, endured the torture stake on our behalf.  Let us therefore lay aside every thing which would hold us back and the particular sins which beset each of us, and run with endurance the 'race' that is set before us of obtaining the prize of the high calling of God in Messiah Y'shua  (Hebrews 12:1-3; 2 Corinthians 3:18).

&quot;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth&quot;   John 1:14

      <text xml:space="preserve">===REPENTANCE FROM DEAD WORKS===

Repentance is a change that takes place in one's life as a result of the Holy Spirit's work to illumine one's consciousness to the state of sin in the presence of a Holy God.

===THE MEANING OF THE WORD===
In the Hebrew of the Old Covenant two words are used in the concept of repentance, they are -

1.  NAHUM - to lament, to grieve.  This word is describing the emotions that are aroused when motivated to take a 		different course of action.

2. SHUB - This word expresses a radical change of mind toward sin and implies a conscious moral 		separation from sin and a decision to forsake it and agree with God.

In the Greek of the New Covenant, there are also two words used which parallel the Hebrew usage.

1. METAMELOMAI - to have feeling or care, concern or regret which is akin to remorse.

2. METANOEO - to have another mind, which describes that radical change whereby a sinner turns from the idols of sin and of self to God.

Repentance then is the informing and changing of the MIND stirring and directing the EMOTIONS to urge the required change, and the action of the yielded WILL in turning away from sin and to God.

===IMPORTANCE OF REPENTANCE===
1.  God commands it  
&quot;God now commands all men everywhere to repent&quot;  Acts 17:30
He said that He has 'winked' at our previous ignorance - He has turned a blind eye to it, but now there is no excuse.
Paul reasons that the creation itself leaves man without excuse as to the reality of God and His nature.   Romans 1: 19-21

2.  It is Necessary for Salvation 
Y'shua said,  &quot;Except you repent you shall all likewise perish   &quot;  (Luke 13:3).   There is no qualification - it means ALL.
It is the God-appointed way of salvation  -   &quot;for godly sorrow works repentance unto salvation&quot;  2 Corinthians 7:10
    
3.  The Reason for Messiah's coming 
&quot;You shall call his name Y'shua for he shall save his people from their sins&quot; Matthew 1:21

He Himself said,  
&quot;I am come to seek and to save that which was lost&quot;  Luke 19:10
&quot;I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance&quot;  Luke 5:32
&quot;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand&quot; Matthew 4:17
John the Baptist preached the same message  Matthew 3: 2 &amp; Isaiah 40: 3

4. The commission of His people
It was the original commission of the descendants of Abraham which is now conferred also upon all believers in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.    

Speaking to Israel, &quot;And you shall be to Me  a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot;  on the condition that they kept His covenant and obeyed His laws (Exodus 19: 5).    And again,  You also as living stones are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood..&quot;   -  a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation&quot;  1 Peter 2: 5,9
&quot;That repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations&quot;   Luke 24:47

&quot;Repent and be baptised&quot;  -  the execution of the commission by the apostles   Acts 2:38

&quot;This gospel of the kingdom (i.e. repentance and remission of sins) should be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, &quot;  Matthew 24:14

===THE NEED FOR REPENTANCE===
A repentance - a turning away from sin and to God is necessary, because Yahweh's law says  &quot;the soul that sins, it shall die&quot;  Ezekiel 	18: 4,20   (Adam initially broke the law  Genesis 2:16-17)

Death in all its aspects is now upon Adam's race  -   
Romans 5:12  As by one man sin entered in, death passed unto all men  
:14-21	  Death reigned. and through that state of spiritual death sin reigned, until Grace to repent was extended through the Messiah.

Romans 6:23  The wages/penalty of sin is spiritual and eternal (as well as ultimate physical death).  See Romans 2: 6-12

The true meaning of 'death' as it is used in the scripture is in a spiritual sense as a state of separation from God.

Adam broke his communion/fellowship with Yahweh when he disobeyed His commandment.  As a result he was severed from his life source in God, the spiritual life which had energised his being.  Devoid of the real essence of life that he had known, he was thereafter a relatively empty shell. 
This state is called spiritual death.  Mankind today without Messiah, functions like a spiritual zombie by comparison with what he was created to be.  Even spiritually quickened 'man' has only a small portion, a deposit, of his originally endowed spiritual capacity.

Man without God is going his own way, setting his own standards and making his own choices,  
&quot;all we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned each one to his own way&quot;  Isaiah 53: 6a 

for &quot;There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.&quot;  Proverbs 14:12

But He laid upon Him, the Lamb of God, the iniquity of us all  (Isaiah 53:6b), to atone for our sin and make reconciliation, to restore us to life!    BUT, we must turn back from going our own way, to go His way.

===FACTORS THAT BRING MEN TO REPENTANCE===
=====Preaching of the Word =====
The gospel/good news is the power of God unto salvation to all them that believe&quot;  Romans 1:16

&quot;They went out and preached that men should repent&quot;  Mark 6:12

&quot;Testifying  ..   ..   ..  repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord, Y'shua the Messiah&quot;   Acts 20:21

&quot;the gospel came in word and in power, and in the Holy Spirit in much assurance,   ... .... how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God &quot;  1 Thessalonians 1:5-10

It is His ordained method to use preaching for the salvation of souls.  1 Corinthians 1:21

=====Rebuke=====
&quot;If your brother trespasses against you, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him  &quot;  Luke 17:3
It is rebuke born out of love with the object of effecting repentance - not condemnation.	Hebrews 12:11  &amp;  Proverbs 3:11,12

=====The Goodness of God=====
&quot;the goodness of God leads you to repentance&quot;   Man's sin deserves judgment, but He extends His mercy to us.  Romans 2: 4 
&quot;Good and upright is Yahweh, therefore He teaches sinners the way&quot;   Psalm 25:8
&quot;While we were yet sinners, Messiah died for us &quot;   Romans 5: 7, 8

=====Divine Enabling=====
&quot;By grace are you saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God&quot;  Ephesians 2:8

Grace is the unmerited intervention of God on our behalf to impart by His power a spiritual enabling. Minds of men are blinded to the truth  -  2 Corinthians 4:4

They need instruction  -  &quot;If perhaps God will grant them repentance, so that they might know the truth&quot;   2 Timothy 2:25

Y'shua has God exalted  ..  ..  to give repentance unto Israel&quot;  Acts  5:31

&quot;God has also granted to the Gentiles (nations) repentance unto life&quot;   Acts 11:18

===THE NATURE OF REPENTANCE===
Repentance involves all the components of our being,  Mind (Intellect), Emotions, Will and our Spirit.

====Mind====
A person must understand the real nature of sin, to forsake it and turn to God.  This is where the operation of God's word is effectual to bring to the sinner's mind the understanding of sin in the sight of a Holy God.
Within the faculties of a person's mind, the 'turning'  begins in a change of thinking and evaluation of oneself from viewing the particular thing as acceptable or pleasurable, to seeing sin as sin, agreeing with God and saying the same thing that He says about it.  This is true confession of sin, not merely verbally pleading for forgiveness of what we have done.
This requires the illuminating power of the Holy Spirit to bring God's perspective on it and agree with His judgment on it.

Notice the prodigal son in Luke 15:21, David in Psalm 51:4 and Saul in Acts 9: 4-6

====Emotions====
Emotions are an important aspect of repentance.  True repentance involves godly sorrow for sins committed.

For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation  ..  .. but the sorrow of the world (remorse) works death&quot;  2  Corinthians 7: 9,10

Remorse for the consequences of our sin, being self-centered, will only bring reform - a temporal effort of self improvement.  It will not produce a true change of heart resulting in a character change.

True repentance includes deep humiliation and utter dependence upon God in our need for deliverance from our sinful state (Psalm 51:17; Isaiah 57:15) and includes a sense of shame  (Ezra 9:6).

A genuine hatred for the sin and a loathing of our sinful ways will be experienced.  Psalm 97:10  Luke 18:13

====Will====
From a heart being broken before God in contrition, the will is engaged to resolve a change of course, forsaking the old way and turning in a new direction in which the determination is to please Yahweh.   It is a deliberation to turn from sin and pleasing self,  to pleasing Him.    The prodigal son is an example  - &quot;I will arise and go&quot;  Luke 15:18-20
A repentant person accepts responsibility for their sin, and does not blame others.  James 1:14-15

It is &quot;I&quot; who sinned and needs to do something about it, calling upon the mercy of God to break old habits, make straight paths for their feet and receive the Spirit's enabling to live a holy life. Psalm 38:18; Hebrews 12:12; 2 Peter 1:5-9 &amp; Romans 13:12-14

So repentance is a process which commences with the mind being informed so as to effect a change of attitude toward sin, and an exposure and realisation of the nature of it in one's life, which brings a change of heart - an emotional response of turning to hate what was once indulged, and a decision of will to forsake it.

====Spirit====
This 'turning' on our behalf, through the illumination and empowering of the Spirit of God, effects a change in our spirit-being,  whereby we are initially 'born again'.  Thereafter the Spirit continue to illumine areas of our life which will need change.

===EFFECTS 0F REPENTANCE===
1. Conversion  - We become new creatures  &quot;Repent and be converted&quot;  Acts 3:19
Repentance is our response to God - Regeneration is God's response to us

2. Changed from Death to Life	from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.    Ephesians 2:1;  Colossians 1:13,14

3. Forgiveness and Remission of Sins  Sins are blotted out and times of refreshing come from Yahweh.   Acts 3:19

4. Cleansed Conscience   Dead works keep alive a consciousness of sin from which the blood purges us (Hebrews 9:14), to have confidence toward Yahweh.  Hebrews 10:22

5. Rejoicing in Heaven   over every sinner who repents  Luke 15:7-10

6. Good Works - the Fruit of Repentance   A requirement for a converted life is to have an outworking of spiritual fruit in one's life   Matthew 3: 8;  Acts 26:20 

True repentance brings a change in lifestyle from disobedience and lawlessness to the obedience of Yahweh
and His holy precepts.


&quot;Narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it&quot;  Matthew 7:14

      <text xml:space="preserve">===FAITH TOWARD GOD===

Faith and repentance are inseparable in effecting a genuine conversion,  Paul speaks of &quot;Repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord, Y'shua the Messiah&quot;  Acts 20:21.   Faith is the second aspect of conversion.
To repent of sin and fail to exercise faith in Yahweh for reconciliation, ends in failure and despair.

===THE MEANING OF THE WORD===
The root word from which we get 'faith, the noun is PISTIS,     and 'believe', the verb is PISTUEO

FAITH - PISTIS means faith, belief, firm persuasion, assurance, firm conviction, faithfulness.

BELIEVE - PISTUEO - to trust in and rely upon, commit to the charge of, confide in, have a mental persuasion.

It is the act whereby a person lays hold of God's resources, becomes obedient to what He has prescribed and putting aside all self interest and self-reliance, trusts Him completely.  It is an unqualified surrender of the whole of one's being in dependence upon Him.  It is wholly trusting and relying upon Him for all things. It is not just mental assent to the facts and realities of truth, it must come from a deep inner conviction. 
									      - the demons also believe - James 2:19

&quot;Trust in Yahweh with all your heart and lean not to your own understanding&quot;   Proverbs 3:5

&quot;He that trusts in his own heart is a fool&quot;   Proverbs  28:26

===SCRIPTURAL DEFINITION===
&quot;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&quot;    Hebrews 11: 1

Faith is the connecting power into the spiritual realm, which links us with God and makes Him becomes a tangible reality to the sense perceptions of a person.  Faith is the basic ingredient to begin a relationship with God.  

Faith is the assurance that the things revealed and promised in the Word are true, even though unseen, and gives the believer a conviction that what he expects in faith, will come to pass. Faith is the tangible essence of what is hoped for - so tangible that the faith itself, is the evidence/reality of those things that are not yet visible.  In other words, it becomes so tangible that you now possess it.  It becomes a reality in the spiritual realm.
this is really good.

===IMPORTANCE OF FAITH===
It is impossible to be saved without faith and &quot;without faith it is impossible to please God&quot;   Hebrews 11: 6

Everything in salvation is based on faith.  We have to believe in that which we cannot see. Faith is a spiritual force that overcomes great opposition and can carry a person through great trials and triumphs over circumstances in the natural realm.  See Hebrews Chapter 11, the faith chapter.

Abraham is cited as the 'father' of faith and we as believers come under the Abrahamic covenant, a covenant which Yahweh established with him on the basis of his faith.

Abraham believed Yahweh, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.   Romans  4: 3
&quot;to him who ..   ..  believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness&quot;   Romans 4: 9

Abraham heard the Word  - Romans 4:13
He turned (repentance)  - 4:18,19
He embraced the hope -    4:18
He did not waver in his commitment - 4:20
He rejoiced in it as an accomplished fact - 4:20

===THE OPERATION OF FAITH===
&quot;To those who have obtained like precious faith by the righteousness of our God and Saviour, Y'shua the Messiah.&quot; 2 Pet. 1: 1

&quot;Y'shua the author and finisher of our faith&quot;   Hebrews 12: 2

Faith is the medium through which we receive from Yahweh God, our salvation and all our ongoing needs.  Ephesians 2: 8-9
We must believe and respond to the Word which then will produce in us faith as a 'fruit of the Spirit'  (Galatians 5:22).

Faith as a fruit of the Spirit operating in our lives, draws us into close relationship and trust in Him. Faith works by love, and our relationship and spiritual walk, gives us confidence to exercise the impartation of the faith which we receive.  
The operation of faith is dependent upon our relationship with God.   Galatians 5: 6;   John 15: 4-5

Y'shua said, &quot;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you&quot; John 15: 7

There are four foundations for Biblical faith ---
1. The Promises of God's Word
&quot;All the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him, Amen, &quot;  2 Corinthians 1:20

&quot;(through the knowledge of Him) .. .. .. by which  have been given to us exceeding great and precious 	promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, &quot;   2 Peter 1: 4

2.  The Integrity of The Word
&quot;Every good and perfect gift, comes down from the Father of light, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.&quot;   James 1:17

&quot;God is not a man that he should lie, nor a son of man that He should repent, has He said, and will He not do?&quot;  Numbers 23:19

3.  The Ability of God to Endorse The Promise
Abraham &quot;did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith .. .. being fully convinced that what He had promised, He was also able to perform.&quot;   Romans 4:20-21

4.  The Confidence of the Believer in The Promises
This confidence is based on the conviction that when the promises are laid hold of by faith, then the results of that 	faith are 	guaranteed.

===RUDIMENTS OF FAITH===
====Knowledge - the Engagement of the Mind====
The mind has to be informed for faith to operate, and that has to be based upon the Word.

&quot;Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God&quot;  Romans 10:17
&quot;Many of them which heard the Word, believed&quot;   Acts 4: 4

The 'hearing' here is not just with the natural ear, but the spirit of man which has to be opened to 'hear'.  This is where the Spirit of God comes into operation to open our spiritual ears to hear, so that faith can operate, as faith is a faculty of our human spirit.  Faith must rest on facts, realities from the Word of God, otherwise what you believe can be presumption,  if it originates from self.
When a 'word' is quickened to one's spirit by the holy Spirit, then it will agree with the written Word in principle.

Initial saving faith, as well as the exercise of  ongoing faith, is an impartation of the Spirit, a 'gift' of the Holy Spirit. 
Reading the written Word and keeping filled with the Spirit will facilitate our faith to be activated and enable us to move and live in the faith realm.  1 Corinthians 12: 9

With salvation particularly, an informed mind does not guarantee saving faith,   &quot;For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.&quot;  Hebrews 4: 2

====Response - the Stirring of the Emotions====
Faith lifts one's spirit into the expectation of hope and joy (&quot;joy of faith&quot;  Philippians 1:25).

With salvation there is joy, gratitude for deliverance and sins forgiven.  Acts 8: 8 &amp; 1 Thessalonians 1: 6

With all impartation of faith, the spirit soars to new heights, there is exhilaration, new expectations, joy and gladness 
&quot;Whom having not seen, you love: in whom though now you see Him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.&quot;  1 Peter 1: 8

Even though a response may be evoked to the message/word, if the will is not activated, then it will be a word fallen in a stony place where there was no depth of commitment, and though they received the word with joy, have no root in themselves to follow it through.   Matthew 13: 5  - 20-21

====Commitment of the Will====
The will of a person needs to be engaged to follow through and implement their belief into action.  Belief needs to go from the mind through the heart and activate the will to take hold of what has been understood and responded to, and make it part of one's life.  This then in its outworking, becomes obedience to the 'Word'.
The scriptures speak of &quot;obedience to the faith&quot; (Romans 1: 5),  this is where faith has had its complete outworking.

&quot;The revelation of the mystery.....  .... is made known to all nations for the obedience of faith&quot;  Romans 16:25,26

===HINDRANCES TO FAITH===
====Absence of the Word====
In the parable of the Sower (Matt.13:19-), Y'shua spoke of the seed as the Word of God which goes into various types of soil, i.e. human hearts, where it is either nurtured unto full growth, or it is destroyed.  The difference depends on the soil, the heart into which it falls.   
Notice the things which hinder the growth of the Word  -
a) stony ground   i.e. no depth of spiritual life
b) thorns    cares of this life
c) birds of the air   demonic influence, causing doubt, unbelief

====Wrong Motivation====
Y'shua said, &quot;Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.&quot;   Matthew 6:33
It is when our desires are centred on spiritual things - things to advance the kingdom, that the promise of John 14:13 and 
15:16 apply.
&quot;Do not lay up for yourself treasures upon earth  .. .. .. but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break through and steal.  
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&quot;   Matthew 6:19-21

&quot;You ask and you do not receive because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.  Adulterers and adulteresses!  Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?  Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself the enemy of God&quot;  James 4: 3-4

=====Wrong Source of Knowledge====
All knowledge that comes to the natural man is through the five senses  -- seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling and touching.  All of these senses connect us to the natural realm of this world.
Accepting the conditions which we see as fact, instead of what the Word says will hinder faith.

1. Our physical body interprets things according to it's senses; hunger, pain, fatigue cold, sight and hearing  etc.

2. Our soul, that is, our mind, will and emotions react to our environment and circumstances conditioned by our 	 	physical senses in the world around us.  The perceptions of our mind take in knowledge of the Word but it can be 	just intellectual knowledge and not revelation knowledge which activates faith.

3. Our spirit functions in the spiritual realm.  The faculties of our spirit are intuition (i.e. insight), imagination (i.e. 	vision)  and will (i.e. motivation).  Faith operates through our spirit's visionary capacity to enable revelation 	knowledge which unveils the mind of purposes of Yahweh God to us.  
The faculties of our spirit give us perception of spiritual realities!

4.  Failure to Confess the Word
Faith not verbalised, is faith not activated.  When we receive the spirit of faith, we must also speak out the &quot;word of faith&quot;, for it to have the creative power of God.
&quot;And since we have received the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, 'I believed and therefore I spoke'. we also believe and therefore speak,&quot;  2 Corinthians 4:13 from Psalm 116:10.
We will have whatever we confess before men.  Mark 11:23; Romans 10: 8-10

===THE RESULTS OF SPIRITUAL FAITH===
1. Salvation from sin and its results in spirit, soul and body.   Romans 3:21-26; 5: 1-2, 9-10

2. Assurance which rests on the facts of the Word of God and is a work of the Spirit.   Galatians 3:26; 4: 6

3. Obedience which will result in good works   James  2:18-20;  Matthew 5:16

4. Confession of our faith  &quot;with the heart one believes, with the mouth confession is made unto salvation&quot;  Romans 10:10   
Confession puts a seal upon what we have believed.


&quot;I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed unto Him against that day&quot;  2 Timothy 1:12

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE GRACE OF GOD===
The word 'grace' literally means 'favour'
In Hebrew it is	CHEN from a root word CHANAN -  to bend or stoop in kindness to another as a superior to an inferior (Strongs  2603)
In Greek it is	CHARIS	and has the idea of graciousness in manner or action (Strongs 5485) it comes from a root word CHAIRO to be cheerful, happy  (Strongs 5463)

When used in reference to God, it is the benevolent action of Him stooping down to us in His kindness to reach us in our need,  and convey upon us a benefit. His grace has been termed 'unmerited favour' but it is more than an attitude of favour or mercy.  His mercy is an expression of His compassion toward us, but His grace is an extension of benevolence translated into action that releases His enabling power into our lives. 

Seeing that we never merit His favour, we are always indebted to Him to extend to us His Mercy and bestow upon us His grace whereby we may respond to Him in an acceptable manner. From beginning to end we are dependent upon Him, for life itself, for all sustenance by which we continue to live and have our existence, and on a spiritual level from that, all energising power by which we progress in our walk.

&quot;In him we live and move and have our being (our existence)&quot; Acts 17:28

===THE POWER OF HIS GRACE===
&quot;By grace you have been saved&quot;   Ephesians 2: 5b
&quot;By grace are you saved by faith and that not of yourselves, it is the gift (charis) of God&quot;	Ephesians 2: 8

&quot;Not of works, lest anyone should boast. For we are His workmanship  ..  2: 9,10a
By grace you are saved  v.5
the faith you exercised was  a gift  -  part of His divine enabling  v.8
it was nothing of your own works  v.9					  You are His workmanship  v.10

&quot;Therefore it is of faith that it might be through grace&quot;  Romans 4:16
&quot;Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Y'shua the Messiah, whom God set forth as a propitiation by his blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God has passed over the sins previously committed, to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be the justifier of the one who has faith in Y'shua&quot;   Romans 3:24

We are justified by His grace, having passed over our sins in His forbearance and in His righteousness
																																							          &quot;Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Y'shua the Messiah, through whom also we have access into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.&quot;   	Romans 5: 1, 2

We have peace with God and have a standing with Him based on grace in the hope of receiving His glory

&quot;Having predestined us to adoptions as sons by Y'shua the Messiah to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved.&quot;   Ephesians 1: 6

Predestined to adoption  - i.e. not our choice
It is according to the good pleasure of His will  -   His choice to the praise of the glory of His grace
					     
And it certainly is to the praise of the wondrous glory of His grace!
&quot;Even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Y'shua the Messiah our Lord.&quot;   Rom. 5:21

===GRACE AND WORKS COMPARED===
Grace justifies   Titus 3: 7						Works can never justify  Romans 11: 6
Grace is given  freely   Romans 3:24
Works makes us debtors  Romans 4: 4
Grace gives humility &amp; faith for salvation  Eph.2:8,9   		Works makes us boastful  Romans 2:17-20
Grace glorifies God  Ephesians 1: 6 				
Works honours man   Colossians 2:20-23
Grace says Messiah did it all for us  Galatians 5: 4  			Compared to our own efforts  Rom.3:20

===GRACE AND LAW===
&quot;Now to him who works, the wages are not counted as grace but as debt &quot; Romans 4: 4

The Law gives a knowledge of righteousness but there is no power inherent in it to enable us to fulfill its demands. In our sinful state we are incapable of meeting its demands. 

Y'shua said, &quot;Do not think that I came to destroy the law and the prophets.  I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.&quot;
&quot;one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.&quot;	Matthew 5:17-18
Y'shua came to meet the demands of the Law, not doing away with it, but fulfilling and completing it so that He might bring it to finality, that He might introduce a New Covenant!
The Mosaic Law is now obsolete in this sense, as being a vehicle by which man could attain to righteousness in the sight of God.
The Ten Commandments which were written in stone are what Paul refers to as &quot;the LETTER&quot; &quot;Written and engraven in stones&quot; and such, Paul wrote, are a ministry of &quot;condemnation&quot; and &quot;death&quot;. 
But, he wrote, we are made &quot;able ministers of the NEW covenant, NOT the &quot;old&quot;. (2 Cor. 3:6) &quot;Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.&quot;

Some teach that the requirements of the Law still need to be met, but this would imply that Messiah Y'shua has not already done this.
The &quot;not under law but under grace&quot; teaching is not a false concept when taken to mean that we are exempt from fulfilling the Old Covenant contract made between God and Israel as a vehicle or means of attaining righteousness. As Paul wrote, &quot;And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith&quot;  see Philippians 3:9 Paul once tried to attain righteousness by keeping the law, but was forever done with that once he experienced God's Grace!

Being under grace means that we are not under the dominion of sin - &quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace.&quot; (Rom. 6:14)
Paul wrote: &quot;The strength of sin is the Law&quot; therefore, if we stay under the keeping of the Law, then we will continue to be under the strength and control of sin in our lives. (1 Cor. 15:56)
But Paul says that if we live under Grace, then sin shall ''not'' have dominion over us.
&quot;What then?  Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? 
Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, you are that one's slaves whom you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness.&quot;    Romans 6:14-16
The obedience Paul refers to here is not obedience to the Mosaic Law, but to the &quot;obedience of faith&quot; (Rom. 1:5), when one walks &quot;in the Spirit&quot;, he will &quot;not fulfill the lust of the flesh.&quot; (Gal. 5:16)
When the believer walks &quot;in love&quot; he or she is fulfilling the righteousness the Mosaic Law could never produce. (Rom. 13:10)

When false teachers say that believers must still obey the Mosaic Law, which ones and how many of these laws must be followed??? There is no more Temple, so the sacrifices cannot be fulfilled.
If they say that sacrifices are no longer required, then they are amending Moses' law and there is no authority for that!
Jesus came to fulfill and replace the Mosaic Covenant with a New Covenant based on Two commandments: &quot;And this is His Commandment, (1)That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, 
and (2) love one another, as He gave us Commandment.&quot;  He that loves his brother has fulfilled the law.&quot; (Rom. 13:10);  
&quot;For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.&quot; (Gal. 5:14) This &quot;one word&quot; (not 10, not 613) but &quot;one&quot; command negates any need for any others, for in fulfilling the commandment of &quot;love&quot; the entire law is satisfied.

The Law is only still in force in relation to, and as a foundation for, civil governments as long as a sinful world exists, for Paul wrote: &quot;Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient...&quot; Therefore, it is not a law for God's people who are &quot;in Messiah&quot;, but for the world of sinners.

When Paul wrote, &quot;For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor&quot; (Gal. 2:18) he is saying that if he were to rebuild Law-keeping back into his life, he would thus become susceptible to breaking it all over again. For, when the commandment comes, sin is revived! (Rom. 7:9 &quot;when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.&quot;)

James tells us that a life of faith without the corresponding works is 'dead'.  &quot;A man is justified by works, and not by faith only&quot;  (James 2:24), and, &quot;I will show you my faith by my works&quot;  (James 2:18)
Living in a faith relationship with the Son will produce the same fruit that He produced by living in a faith relationship with the Father.  John 15:1-9; 14: 9-11;  8:31-37 This, however, does not imply 
the &quot;works of the Law&quot; but &quot;actions&quot; corresponding to New Covenant faith.

It is a flawed concept that because we are now saved by grace, and therefore being 'under grace', that we can excuse ourselves from shunning sin in our lives.  Rather, His grace enables us to shun sin in our lives by following, not the Mosaic Law, but by following &quot;the Spirit&quot;, into loving one another. &quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are NOT UNDER THE LAW, but under grace.&quot; (ROM. 6:14)


===GRACE - HIS DIVINE ENABLING===
&quot;And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,  and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth&quot;   John 1:14 

&quot;For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Y'shua the Messiah.  No one has seen God at any time.  The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&quot;  John 1:17-18
&quot;And of His fullness we have all received,  and grace upon grace&quot;  John 1:16

He was full of the Father's divine enabling (His grace) empowering Him to fulfill the law's requirements. Of that fullness we have received, and so, by His enabling we can also begin to fulfill all righteousness.

Grace upon grace is available to us.

The word of His grace is able to build us up in Him so that we enter into the inheritance of the saints.  Acts 20:32

To be holy as He is holy,  is our inheritance and His expectation of us.  Genesis 17: 1-2; Exodus 19: 6; 1 Peter 1:15-16

&quot;For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,  teaching us that,  denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly in the present age.&quot;   Titus 2:11-12

&quot;And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work&quot;    2 Corinthians  9: 8   
He is able to make 'grace', His enabling power available to us, it is up to us to avail ourselves of His resources
.
&quot;Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.&quot;  Heb. 4:16

&quot;Therefore gird up the loins of your mind and hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Y'shua the Messiah:  as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance; but as He who has called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct  &quot;     1 Peter 1:13-15

&quot;looking carefully lest anyone  fall short of the grace of God  &quot;   Hebrews 12:15-17

&quot;lest any root of bitterness ..  ..  ..
&quot;lest there be any fornicator  ..  ..  ..
&quot;or profane person like Esau  ..  ..  ..

&quot;Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of Yahweh and of Y'shua our Lord, as His divine power (dunamis - i.e. energising power) has given to us all things that pertain to life (spiritual life) and godliness .. ..&quot;
&quot;by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust..&quot;

But also for this very reason, giving all diligence,
add to your faith virtue,  (spiritual strength)
to virtue knowledge, (of the Word)
to knowledge self-control,  (of the flesh)
to self-control	add perseverance,
to perseverance	add godliness,
to godliness add brotherly kindness
and to brotherly kindness add love (His unconditional love)

For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Yeshua the Messiah.  For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.    Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make your call and election sure, for if you do these things you will never stumble;&quot;     2 Peter:1-10

Peter is teaching us here that Yahweh has given to us all that we need to become partakers of His divine nature,  promises in the Word specific to our need,  and His grace is extended to us in divine enabling to be able to appropriate these things into our life step by step - grace upon grace.  One portion or level of grace upon another.

Our walk commences with an impartation of faith which we must add to in strengthening ourselves in His presence,  so that the process of growth from initial faith to His perfect love may be accomplished in our lives.  (Ephesians 3:16-19)

Being strengthened in our spirit by His grace will impart the virtue (strength) to put aside self,  seeking the knowledge of His will and walking in obedience, wherein the  exercise of self-control over inclinations/lusts of the flesh will be required. Perseverance/continuing on in the way of keeping the flesh under control will effect godliness/His character and nature in us,  so that we exercise brotherly kindness in our relationships in the situations of life until we have matured to perfect His love in our lives,  so that we love all people in all circumstances.
If we fail to do this Peter says we are shortsighted of the fact that we were cleansed from sin to live a new life in Messiah.

We are told to &quot;grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Y'shua Messiah&quot;  ( 2 Peter 3:18)
 
Growing in the experiental knowledge of His ability to enable us to live the life, is mandatory. 
  
Living things grow!

That which is stunted in growth becomes weak and diseased.  Growth is an antidote for falling away from the faith,  from &quot;the true grace of God wherein you stand&quot;  (1 Peter 5:12)   The only place we can stand is in His enabling power.  Not in our own works/efforts, knowledge, past attainments or whatever,  we only stand by grace, at all times. 

&quot;But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us&quot;   2 Cor.4: 7

Remember,  
&quot;For God gives grace to the humble&quot; (1 Peter 5: 5) but,  resists the proud.  Proverbs 3:34

===MINISTRY GIFTS BASED ON GRACE===
&quot;But to each of us grace was given according to the measure of Messiah's gift&quot;   Ephesians 4: 7

We are all given a deposit of grace wherein we can function in the Body and partake in its growth, personally and corporately.   Although the gifts are given, they need to be exercised and developed to have increase. He is expecting a return  Matt.25:14-29

&quot;Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.  For our God is a consuming fire.&quot;   Hebrews 12:28, 29

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE ORDINANCE OF WATER BAPTISM===

The word &quot;Baptism&quot; is a transliteration of the Greek word BAPTIZO which means to immerse.
In Hebrew it is referred to as a MIKVEH - an immersion.
Basically it is an immersion into another substance, for the purpose of being saturated by it, such as water in this instance.The new covenant also presents the immersion of a believer &quot;in the Spirit of God&quot; and also &quot;with Fire&quot;.  Matthew 3:11

===THE ORDINANCE OF BAPTISM===
Baptism, as it has been known in the gospel age, is not a new ordinance.  In the text of Hebrews 6: 1-2, it is &quot;baptisms&quot; - plural, as there is more than one type of baptism in scripture.  These are --
1.  The baptism of creation to life -  Genesis 1 &amp; 7;  2 Peter 3: 6-7
2.  The baptism of Moses from Egypt - Exodus 14:19-31; 1 Corinthians 10: 1-4
3.  The baptism of Ritual Cleansing - Leviticus 8: 5-9; Numbers 8: 6-7; 19:13, 20
4.  The baptism of John unto repentance - Matthew 3: 1-6
5.  The baptism of Y'shua into His Body - Romans 6:3-5
6.  The baptism in the Spirit of God for ministry - Matthew 3:11 &amp; Luke 3:16
7.  The baptism of fire for purification - Matthew 3:11 &amp; Luke 3:16; 1 Peter 4:12-16

In the beginning, the creation in it's disordered state was immersed in water and it was through the operation of the Spirit brooding upon the waters that He brought forth order out of chaos, and created new life.   Genesis 1: 1-10

The ordinance of immersion originated at creation in the birthing of the earth out of it's submerged state under the water.   When Yahweh gathered the waters together into seas, He caused the earth to be resurrected out of it's watery grave which in effect, was the 'womb' from which it came forth.  The word used for 'gathered waters' in verse 10 is &quot;mikveh&quot;.   The mikveh waters were actually the womb of creation from which He brought forth new life out of it's former state of  'death'.

Water is always used as a cleansing, purifying agent in His purposes to initiate a change from one state of existence to another. It was the element of water that was used in conjunction with the Spirit's power upon the waters, initiated by the Word of God that effected the purposes of Father God. This is the prototype of all other forms of baptism or ritual immersions.

The creation was again cleansed and purified by water with the flood of Noah's day. Peter calls this a baptism of the earth.  There are two elements used by Yahweh for cleansing - water and fire. The earth was cleansed by water the first time, during the flood.  The second time it will be cleansed by fire (immersed in fire), as it is written in 2 Peter 3: 6-7 and Matthew 3:12

The whole nation of Israel was baptised &quot;into Moses&quot; when they went through the Red Sea which separated them and cleansed them from the influence of Egypt which represented the world and it's lifestyle, before being taken to the promised land. The waters of the Red Sea allowed them to pass from one state of existence to another, from the status of bondage and slavery to that of freedom with the status of sonship; to become a nation with an unique calling and destiny.  Exodus chs.12-14; 19:10

Having gone through the mikveh of the Red Sea, they were commanded to undergo ritual cleansing before approaching Yahweh and entering into  covenant with Him at Sinai (Exodus 19:10).   This became an ordained ritual for all necessary natural and  spiritual cleansing and for all acts of consecration and spiritual offerings.  Leviticus 14: 8-9; 13:54-58; 1: 7-9, 10-13; 8:18-21

It applied to all changes of status in life where one progressed from one state of existence to another as a process of cleansing and renewal for the transition to the new appointment or position in life.  It is an acknowledgment that Yahweh God is the source of all life and it is a commitment to live from the enabling which He imparts for the new status in life.

It is undertaken before marriage and before the Bar Mitzvah, before deeper consecration or religious study, after life-changing experiences or enlightenment that initiate a change in one's spiritual status or calling.  It is also taken before consecrated days.

In undergoing the mikveh waters, the person is considered to have been saturated by the Spirit of God and to be &quot;re-born&quot; or &quot;born again&quot; by His creative power, so as to enter into a more elevated state of spiritual life for their new status.  John 3:10, 3

The priests were required to undergo ritual immersion when being consecrated into the priesthood and also after that, in cases  where they would become defiled by contact with that which was unclean.  Leviticus 8: 5-9;  Numbers 8: 6-7; 19:13, 20

The Talmud, Mishnah tells us that the High priest immersed himself five times and washed his hands and feet ten times during the sacrifices and in ministering the office on Yom Kippur ( Moed, Yoma 3 Mishneh 3).  
The Mikveh was the means of maintaining a state of ritual purity before a holy God.

===JOHN'S BAPTISM===
&quot;The voice of one crying in the wilderness;
Prepare ye the way of the Lord;
Make his paths straight.
&quot; ... ... And all flesh shall see the salvation of God&quot;	Luke 3:4,6

After 400 years of silence, John came on the scene as a voice crying out in a spiritual wilderness of hypocritical fundamentalism, legalism and unbelief, to call the nation back to repentance and prepare the way for the Messiah.

&quot;John came baptising in the wilderness and preaching a baptism for remission of sins&quot;  Mark 1: 4

John's call to repentance recorded in the gospels, was echoed through the &quot;Days of Awe&quot; which preceded Yom Teruah (Feast of Trumpets) when each year the nation sought repentance and cleansing from past sins to enable them to pass through the coming judgment day of Yom Kippur.  The baptism in which he officiated was in the month before that yearly preparation for the most holy day of the religious year.  His baptism was an immersion &quot;unto repentance&quot; based upon the ordinances of ritual cleansing.

Remission of sin by baptism (ritual cleansing, the Mikveh) was an established practice in Israel and was understood to be a work of the Spirit of Yahweh God for inner cleansing from sin and defilement, based upon true repentance.  John's Mikveh immersion, was an outward symbol of a mystical inner change that enabled repentant individuals to enter into an elevated state (i.e. a higher spiritual state) to prepare them to receive the Spirit of God and enter the Kingdom of God.  John 3: 5

It was believed that the Messiah would come on one of the Sabbaths (weekly or Festival Sabbaths) and that either he or Elijah would be commissioned to immerse the nation in the Jordan, as Joshua had done, in preparation for the Messianic kingdom.  This was the reason that the Pharisees sent priests and Levites to question John as to whether he was the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah (Deut.18:15; John 1:19-26).  Hence, the statement of John coming in the spirit of Elijah to prepare the way of Messiah.

John, officiating in the priestly office, referred to 'One' coming after him who was greater than he 'whose sandal strap I am not worthy to stoop down and loose'  -  that  'he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit'    Mark 1: 7, 8

John was speaking of something beyond the baptism of repentance which he was proclaiming which was the baptism which Y'shua would authorise in the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh) which we understand to have been enacted in Acts 2: 1-4.

John was preparing the way for the coming kingdom and initiating its subjects to receive their King.  He was heralding the dawn of the new day.   He was the last prophet of the old order pointing the way to the birth of the kingdom on earth of which all the prophets had spoken.  Now was the time!

&quot;Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand&quot;    Matthew 3: 2
The first requirement to enter the kingdom was repentance!

===A SPIRITUAL KINGDOM===
Y'shua said that no greater prophet than John had been born, but that those thereafter that were pressing into the kingdom, were greater than he.  Matthew 11:11-12

It was a new concept that the birth of the kingdom upon earth  was spiritual in the hearts of men primarily, most were looking for the Messiah to establish the kingdom in a literal way as an earthly dominion.  The kingdom of heaven was a spiritual kingdom into which men were being born and the first step toward that was repentance and remission of sins.
And so men came to John in the river Jordan confessing their sins and being baptised.    Matthew 3: 6

Y'shua spoke to Nicodemus of being 'born again', not a new concept, but a different application of being born of spirit and of water into the kingdom of God.   A spiritual birth into the kingdom!	(John 3: 3-5)

The disciples of Y'shua were some of those who had responded to John's baptism and been cleansed.  The religious leaders largely did not, they were too self-righteous and although John was of the true priestly lineage, he was outside their instituted order (John 1:21-25).  They rejected the counsel of God coming through Yahweh's ordained prophet and priest.   Luke 7:30

Y'shua also came to be baptised by John 'to fulfil all righteousness' by submitting to His Father's instituted order of priesthood as well as by undergoing the ordained method of preparation, for His change of status into a commission for ministry. In everything Y'shua followed His heavenly Father's established order and fulfilled the conditions for His ordination.

John identified him as the &quot;Lamb of God' which takes away the sin of the world, the Messiah, and the disciples followed Him  (John 1:29-37)  to go on in their preparation and eventually receive the promised deposit of the Holy Spirit.   (John 20:22)  

===Y'SHUA'S BAPTISM===
It was not necessary for Y'shua to be baptised  -   He had no sins to confess that needed cleansing.  As  John said  'I need to be baptised by You, and You are coming to me?'   Matthew 3:14

Y'shua answered him 'Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness'   Matthew 3:15

Fulfilling all righteousness involved obedience to the Levitical law.  All priests were consecrated when they came to  30 years of age.  It is recorded that Y'shua 'began to be about 30 years of age' when he came to John.  (Number 4: 3 &amp;  Luke 3:23)

The consecration was two-fold 
1.  Washing   i.e. baptism
2.  Anointing   (Exodus 29: 4-7;  Leviticus 8: 6-36)

Through His baptism, in the washing of the water and the anointing of the Ruach HaKodesh in the form of a dove (Matt.3:16), He was fulfilling the Father's righteous requirements of ritual cleansing for consecration under the Levitical priesthood,  and also for the new status of ordination to His Eternal Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek  (Psalm 110:4 &amp; Hebrews 7:21). He was thus legally justified and divinely consecrated for the work of redemption.   (Ex.29:4 ; Acts 4:27; &amp; 10:38)

His ministry in the Melchizedek priesthood was to supersede the Levitical and the legitimate  transfer from one order to the other had to be effected by the God-ordained priest of the day, which was John, and the Holy Spirit witnessed to this ordination.  

It was a common experience in the old order to experience a divine commissioning to the ministry through visible signs and manifestations, visions and/or an audible voice from heaven, through the act of 'baptism' (the Mikveh).

This type of acknowledgment as a &quot;son&quot; of the father was a Hebraic concept of being called to a specific ministry in a prophetic role for the Most High.  Luke 3:22; 24:19; Matthew 3:16-17

Being called His 'Beloved Son' was an acknowledgment of His calling to be the second 'son' (as Adam was the first), a son who would redeem mankind and be the progenitor of a new order of 'man'.  Luke 3:38; 1 Corinthians 15:45- 49

In His baptism, Y'shua was identifying Himself as the Son of man in the sinner's need of cleansing for His role of taking man's place as the last 'Adam', and as such He submitted to the Father's ordinance of Baptism (the mikveh)   His first commission was to go out into the wilderness and be tempted of the devil, to succeed where Adam had failed in withstanding the temptations of the enemy.  In submitting Himself in obedience to the ordinances of His Father, and as the first and prototype of a new order and for an example to all who would follow, He needed to undergo the rite of this baptism.

John forbade Him as he knew that He was the Messiah, the Lamb of God and the Baptiser in the Holy Spirit  (John 1:30, 33  &amp;  Matthew 3:11).  But, as Y'shua said,  'allow it now' (literal translation)  i.e. for the purpose of fulfilling the principles of the law.

As part of His call to the ministry prepared for Him by the Father, He also fulfilled the type of the sacrificial lamb being taken to the Levitical priests to be ceremonially washed before being offered.   See Leviticus 1:9,13;   2 Chronicles 4:6  &amp;  Hebrews 9:9,10.   Zacharius,  John's father, was a Levite and being the first-born, John was in line to become a priest (by birth he was a priest - Luke 1:5, 8),  and therefore he had the authority to officiate in the washing of the sacrifice to be offered.

The ceremonial washing in the old order looked forward toward that perfect sacrifice which would come which would complete for all time the offerings for sin.   See Hebrews 9:24-28;  John 1:29
  
It was in His baptism that He was ordained and consecrated to His priestly role of making sacrifices to the Father for the sins of the people through John who officiated in the transfer of the priestly office from the Levitical, to the order of Melchizedek and conferred that priestly office upon Y'shua.   Hebrews 7:12, 14-17

In His baptism He was being inaugurated as both the priest and a sacrifice.    Hebrews 10:12,14  &amp;  1 Peter 3:18

Y'shua was born a king (Matthew 2: 2; John 1:49) and He was anointed for His prophetic and priestly role in His baptism.
And so, Y'shua went out anointed as prophet, priest and king, to be tested by the enemy and secure His eternal inheritance as the second Adam/type of man in that which the first man, Adam, had lost.  (Luke 4:1)

===THE VALIDATION OF HIS MINISTRY===
In effect Y'shua had a threefold witness to His ordination as the sacrificial lamb and as a priest of the new order.
The Water, the Spirit and the Father's testimony.  These three bore witness, two in heaven and one upon the earth.  That was a valid witness according to Yahweh's divine principles.  (2 Corinthians 13:1;  Hebrews 6:18)

See 1 John 5:6-8 - there are five things named that can bear witness.  In this instance we have two from the 'godhead' and one earthly element, water.   The Father and the Spirit witnessed to His Baptism (in the water) for His ministry.

&quot;There was a man sent from God whose name was John.  This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe.&quot;    John 1: 6-7

      <text xml:space="preserve">===PATTERN OF THE PROPHESIED BAPTISM IN THE SPIRIT ===
The disciples had an initial work of cleansing from John's baptism of repentance.  There was also an ongoing work of cleansing as the  'water of the word' washed over their lives during the time of their being with Y'shua,  and they became, 'clean through the word I have spoken to you' as Y'shua said. (John 13:10 &amp; 15:3  see also Ephesians 5:26)

Being fully prepared by Y'shua's ministry to them,  they became the first recipients of the 'baptism with the Holy Spirit and fire' of which John spoke.  (Luke 3:16)   According to Y'shua's instructions they waited until the day of Pentecost had fully come which was actually 10 days from the time He ascended into heaven until the Spirit actually fell upon them and 50 days in all from the time He rose from the grave.   Acts 2:1-4  

Yahweh had originally established the pattern when He brought the nation out of the land of Egypt and effected their deliverance by means of the Passover lamb.  Then, at Mt. Sinai fifty days later, He  established His covenant agreement with them amidst many signs and wonders and supernatural manifestations of His Presence while He tabernacled on the mountain.   

In Acts 2 He came to tabernacle in them and the demonstrations of His power were through them in supernatural manifestations of divinely inspired utterances, which came forth from them with flames of fire being seen over them. It was a parallel to the Sinai experience for the establishment of a new covenant.  (Acts 2: 3,4)

At Sinai, He gave them His written law on tablets of stone, here at this time He engraved His law on the fleshly tablets of their hearts.   What was impossible in the old covenant, He effected in the new through His Son, the Lamb of God.  (2 Cor. 3: 3)

At Sinai, 3,000 were slain as  a result of their rebellion (Ex.32:28), now at this time 3,000 are saved.  (Acts 2:41) Whereas then they withdrew in fear from the power of His Spirit, now they embrace it and become empowered to go forth as new-creation men, full of the Holy Spirit and power.

===THE DIVINE COMMISSION===
Upon being filled with the Ruach HaKodesh, the commission that the disciples went out with was  -   
&quot;Repent, and let every one of you be baptised for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&quot;  
For the promise is unto you and to your children,  and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call&quot;  Acts 2:38-9

THE PROCLAMATION -  REPENT
::::BE BAPTISED
::::THE PROMISE	-	     
:::::::::YOU SHALL RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT

All in one baptism.   BY		
:::REPENTANCE
:::REMISSION OF SINS
:::RECEIVING THE HOLY SPIRIT

===Y'SHUA'S COMMAND===
&quot;Go ye into all the world and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you;&quot; (This command extended to the ends of the world)  Matthew 28:19-20

Make disciples!  -   baptising them  ..  ..  .. teaching them to observe all things I have commanded you.

We are commanded to be baptised.  It is not an optional extra.  It is an essential part of our turning from our old course of life and a demonstration of a change of nature in our desire to obey and keep His commandments.  Y'shua said &quot;If you love me, you will keep my commandments&quot;  (John 14:15).  We prove our love by obedience. 
 
To refuse water baptism is to live in disobedience to His revealed will.
It is one of the prime foundational ordinances and testimonies of the new-covenant man.  Baptism is an integral part of the new covenant.  Y'shua is the door and this could be called the doorway, as it is the entrance point into the new life.

It is also the validation of our desire to put to death our old way of life and follow the Lamb wherever He goes.   And, He went through the waters of baptism as an example for all to follow.  He was the first of the new order and authorised it for all who would come after.
We demonstrate our faith in Him by the act of going through baptism.   James 2:17-18

&quot;He who believes and is baptised will be saved&quot;   Mark 16:16

===NEW COVENANT PATTERN===
=====In Jerusalem=====
The first record of Baptism is in the Book of Acts Ch.2 on the day of Pentecost. This was the birth of the new assembly in the power of the Spirit. The disciples preached the DEATH, BURIAL and RESURRECTION of our Lord, Y'shua the Messiah and conviction came upon those who were gathered there for the observance of the feast. 'What shall we do to be saved?'

the answer  --  &quot;Repent, and be baptised every one of you in the name of Y'shua the Messiah for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&quot;   Acts 2:38

=====In Samaria=====
As a result of persecution, the disciples were scattered and Phillip went down to Samaria and preached to them.  Signs and wonders followed the preaching of the Word, and &quot;When they believed Phillip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Y'shua the Messiah, they were baptised, both men and women&quot;   Acts 8:12
Water Baptism followed them believing, and it was in the name of the Lord Y'shua/Jesus.

=====In the Gaza Desert=====
The Angel of the Lord directed Phillip to go from Samaria and to go toward the Gaza desert where a man from Ethiopia was travelling home to Ethiopia from Jerusalem. According to custom, the eunuch was reading the scriptures out aloud from Isaiah 53 of the Messiah, and Phillip going to him expounded the way of salvation.  When they came to water, he asked Phillip, &quot;What hinders me from being baptised?&quot;   Acts 8:36

Upon his confession of faith - (&quot;If you believe with all your heart, you may&quot;)
&quot;I believe that Y'shua the Messiah is the Son of God&quot;  Acts 8:37
He was baptised! -  Baptism followed his confession of faith.

=====In Damascus=====
In Acts 9 Saul was converted on the road to Damascus.  He recognised that he was being given a divine visitation and said, &quot;Who art thou, Lord?&quot;,  whereupon He replied, &quot;I am Y'shua, whom you are persecuting: ..  ..  ..&quot;(Acts 9:5)
&quot;So he trembling and astonished, said 'Lord, what do You want me to do?&quot;   (Acts 9:6)
At this moment Saul was converted as he acknowledged Y'shua as 'Lord',  for no man can say that Y'shua is Lord but by the Holy Spirit.  (1 Corinthians 12:3)

Blinded by the Shekinah glory of the risen and exalted Lord, he was led into Damascus and was ministered to by Ananias who was sent to him by specific instruction in a vision.  Laying his hands on him he prayed for him to receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit, &quot;and he arose and was baptised&quot; Acts 9:18

Later (in Acts 22:16), Paul recalled the words of Ananias, &quot;And now, why tarriest thou?  arise and be baptised, and wash away thy sins, calling on the Name of the Lord&quot;    The emphasis is placed on obedience to the command of baptism immediately after his conversion,  Saul is then baptised as a believer in the Name of the Lord Y'shua.

=====In Caesarea=====
The next account of baptism is found in Acts 10 of Peter's ministry to the household of Cornelius, again by the specific instruction in a vision to both parties.  Y'shua had committed to Peter the keys of the kingdom in the building the Assembly  (Matthew 16:16-18).  He was used to open the door of faith to the Jews in Acts 2 and on this occasion to the 'Gentiles'  (Acts 10:11).  Once again the risen head of the Assembly of Yahweh, working by His Spirit, brings both together for His purposes.
Peter following his instructions goes to Cornelius' house and as he preached to Word to them, the Holy Spirit falls on all who heard and they began to speak with other tongues, which was an undeniable evidence that they had received the Holy Spirit, as had the Jews at Pentecost (Acts 10:46)

Peter immediately responds with, &quot;Can any man forbid water that these should not be baptised, which have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?&quot;  And Peter &quot;commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord.&quot;  (Acts 10:48)

Being baptised and receiving the Holy Spirit were an integral part of the same ordinance, the Holy Spirit was given at baptism.  Having received the Spirit first, baptism completed the experience.
By Peter's command, baptism was as essential for Gentiles as for Jews.

=====In Phillipi=====
As a result of Paul and Silas ministry in Phillipi causing a stir through the deliverance of a girl bound by divination, they were cast into prison.  They prayed and sang praises to Yahweh and He sent an earthquake which shook the foundations of the prison, opened the doors of the cells and loosed the bands of the prisoners.  The keeper of the prison would have been under a penalty of death had the prisoners escaped and so, he was about to kill himself when Paul and Silas assured him that they were there and had not escaped.  Under conviction, the gaoler cried out, &quot;What must I do to be saved?&quot;  to which they responded, &quot;Believe in the Lord, Y'shua HaMashiach and you will be saved, and your house&quot;  Acts 16:30-31
And the result?  They all believed and were &quot;baptised immediately&quot;  Acts 16:33

=====In Corinth=====
When Paul ministered in Corinth it is recorded that &quot;many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptised&quot;  (Acts 18:8).  It is obvious from his letters to them that baptism was a focal issue in their salvation experience.  See 1 Corinthians 1:13-15

=====In Ephesus=====
When Paul arrived there it was obvious that there was something lacking in their spiritual experience.  They were only baptised &quot;unto John's baptism&quot; a baptism unto repentance, and therefore had not received the Holy Spirit.(Acts 19:1-4)  
When they heard that they should believe on Messiah, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Y'shua. -  &quot;and when Paul laid hands on them they received the Holy Spirit&quot;. (Acts 19:5-6)

The baptism of John was not a replacement for messianic/christian baptism.  Being baptised for the repentance of sins and faith toward  God could not be equated with entrance into the kingdom of Yahweh through remission of sins and receiving the Holy Spirit.  They needed the right baptism.

Many believers today only have the equivalent of 'John's baptism' - unto repentance of sin.  They have not understood the message of the spiritual kingdom of new-creation sons of Yahweh.  They have only exercised faith in the salvation of Y'shua for their sins and deliverance from the wrath to come. So, as with the Ephesian believers, upon greater understanding of the truth, re-immersion may be required to become part of the Body of Y'shua and enter into the spiritual kingdom.  

===SALVATION AND BAPTISM===
Coming to faith in the living God is sufficient for a person to receive eternal life.   John 3:16; 5:24; 6:29

Baptism does not make you a new-creation man, but rather because you have repented you should desire to be baptised. It is those who do not believe who will be condemned, although a  person who has come to faith should desire to live in obedience to all of Yahweh God's revealed will.  Mark 16:16

However, sometimes circumstances prevent a person entering into baptism.

Faith to surrender your life to Y'shua the Messiah is necessary for baptism.  You only bury dead people.  You do not bury people to make them dead, but because they are already dead.  Burial is the appropriate thing for a dead body.

If Y'shua gave His all to make eternal life available to us, then we should be willing to follow Him in the waters of baptism according to the example He set of submitting to the will of the Father and obeying His commandments.

&quot;Now by this we know that we know Him, If we keep His commandments.
&quot; He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.&quot;    1 John 2: 3, 6

      <comment>/* ONE BAPTISM FOR BELIEVERS */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE BAPTISM Y'SHUA INSTITUTED===
When John introduced Y'shua as the Messiah to the nation his ministry began to decline and fade into insignificance as he had said &quot;I must decrease, He must increase&quot;  because the ultimate purpose of his ministry was to inaugurate the ministry of Messiah, to initiate the transition of the old order into the new.    John 3:30

As Y'shua began to minister, the multitudes who had flocked to John the forerunner, now followed the One to whom he had pointed - the Messiah,  and we have recorded in the scriptures that He baptised more disciples than John,  and His popularity rose so that he had more followers than John.   John 4:1

When Y'shua presented Himself to John it was not a baptism 'unto repentance', but a baptism to 'fulfil all righteousness'.   
Messiah confirmed and validated the message of John by being baptised by him, even though the greater had come and the transient, old order was passing away.     (Matt.3:15)

===THE PATTERN AND THE TYPE===
He is the mediator of the New Covenant, and as such, because the old order was still in place, Y'shua Himself did not baptise those coming unto repentance - His disciples did, and they did it according to Yochannan's baptism.

Yochannan's baptism of repentance was still in effect until Y'shua had effected the work of redemption upon which he issued a new decree -     
&quot;Go ye therefore, and teach (disciple) all nations, baptising them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Ruach Ha Kodesh: Teaching  them to observe all things which I have commanded you  ...  .. &quot;  Matthew 28:19

The true inner and spiritual cleansing from sin was only to be found in Y'shua Himself and was brought into effect after He was offered	  &quot;But Mashiah came a Cohen Ha Gadol of things to come, with the greater and more perfect tabernacle .....  not of this creation   (Hebrew 9:11) 
&quot;the law having a shadow of the good things to come .......&quot; (Hebrews 10:1)

And so, until the time of His offering as THE Passover Lamb when He also would mediate the new covenant as our Cohen Ha Gadol,  Yochannan's baptism 'unto repentance' remained in place. When the 'blood and water' flowed from His side on the tree,  it put an end to all ceremonial offerings and cleansing.  This was the true 'washing' and cleansing.   He fulfilled all types and they were abolished in His 'once for all' perfect, sinless sacrifice.  Hebrews 7:22-28

When He gave the new command for baptism, His DEATH, BURIAL and RESURRECTION was complete, the finished work of redemption had been made manifest,  and John's baptism was thereby annulled.

===THE NEW ORDER===
Y'shua's death,  burial and resurrection was enacted for us to receive its Spiritual benefits. Not only in sins forgiven but in an imparted new Life.   The water baptism of Y'shua pointed forward to His death.  

In Yordan He was buried in water and His natural life as a man came to an end, a 'death'.  That was the symbolic watery grave of His old life.   Three and a half years later He was literally buried in Joseph's tomb.
Upon arising from the water in Yordan He received the Spirit, later to be resurrected by the power of the Ruach HaKodesh. He arose to be a 'new' man, a new order of man, a second Adam, the firstborn from the dead (Colossains 1:18).   

See Psalm 2:7 and Acts 13:30-33 where it identifies the Father saying 'this day I have begotten thee' as the time when He was risen from the dead.  He became His Son by rebirth at the resurrection, executed by the Spirit (1 Peter 3:18), at that time a second 'Adam' was born to the Father who lives by the power of an endless life, a spiritual man, one who had passed the test of obedience and gained the right to partake of the tree of life.

And so, all who identify with Him in Baptism become 'new creatures' in Mashiah, they become identified in His death, burial and resurrection and therefore by the operation of the Spirit,  arise in Him to a new and glorious life  (Colossians 3:1-3). They bury their old life, putting the old nature to death (by faith) and come out of the water in the power of His resurrection. (Romans 6:3-6)

He was the One cast in to the bitter waters of sin.  Y'shua removes the curse of sin's penalty to release refreshing waters of life.   See the type in Exodus 15:23-26,  at the waters of Marah  the 'tree' was cut down and cast into the water to make the bitter water sweet.  The work of the 'cross' applied to our life makes that which was cursed and bitter, sweet and a blessing.  It completely cancels the retribution from sin and releases us into the glorious liberty of a son of God.   John 1:12; Galatians 4: 4

===IDENTIFICATION AND UNION WITH MESSIAH IN BAPTISM===
When a person immerses in the waters of the Mikveh, he is placing himself in a state of death to his previously known life and is subjecting himself totally to God's creative power.  The Mikveh (pool) itself represents both the grave and the womb. First the individual enters the world of the grave and undergoes a burial. Then he emerges from the womb, his soul having been saturated or overwhelmed by the Spirit, the Ruach HaKodesh, to be resurrected from the watery grave as a new creation in God.
 
This is an identification with Y'shua in His death, burial and resurrection. Speaking of His own soon-coming death, burial, resurrection and glorification as the new-creation Man, Y'shua said,
&quot;Most assuredly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.&quot;   John 12:24    

Those who identify themselves with Him in his death, burial and resurrection become one of the many 'grains' which sprout from the earth from THE Seed, Y'shua Ha Maschiach.  His death becomes their death, His burial theirs, and subsequently His resurrection to new life is imparted to them.  In the process of rebirth, the seed must be planted in the ground or buried in death before it emerges in new life.  When it appears, it gradually grows and becomes the plant which it was designed to be. 
So is the person who is immersed in the Mikveh, he is reborn, as a new creation into an elevated state of spiritual life which has separated or delivered him from the natural, carnal state of existence in this world, just as the waters of the Red Sea separated Israel from the world of Egypt,  
&quot;He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love&quot;   Colossians 1:13.

BUT,
&quot;Except a man be born of WATER and of the SPIRIT he cannot enter the kingdom of God&quot;   John 3: 5

Baptism is the entrance into the spiritual kingdom.

OUR UNION WITH HIM IS IN
1.  HIS DEATH
2.  HIS BURIAL
3. HIS RESURRECTION

1.  IN DEATH
His death was for our sins, our alienation from the Father.  He as the Sin- Bearer, took the penalty for our sins.  He paid the price in full, our debt has been fully paid and there is no longer condemnation for past sins.  

In dying for us and remitting our sins we have been brought back into union with God and have received eternal life. This life is in His Son as a result of the life which He received from the Father as the Second Adam, the first of a new order when he arose from the dead.  Natural human life falls short of The Standard of Elohim and as a result of the first man Adam, becoming alienated from Him, whose life we have inherited by genealogy.

To henceforth live on a level pleasing to Elohim, we need walk in the newness of life which is imparted to us from the Second Adam, Y'shua the Messiah. To do this, we must undergo a spiritual death, burial and resurrection in union with Y'shua, our Redeemer.
&quot;as many of us as were baptised into Y'shua Messiah were baptised into His death&quot;  (Romans 6: 3-4)

We must identify with Y'shua in His death and bury the old life, the life which we lived in our fleshly nature, in the watery grave of the Mikveh.  It is a FACT that our old man WAS crucified with Him on the torture stake.  As Paul said,
&quot;I am crucified with Messiah&quot; (Galatains 2:20)

His death was our death!   

When we look upon Him on the torture stake, we see that it was for us He died and that in receiving His substitutionary work, that He died in our place, we understand that we died there with Him, in His death.

2.  IN BURIAL
In immersion, we go down into the watery grave and bury that old life.  It has been identified with Y'shua in His death and that which is dead, now needs a burial.  The old life/person is buried and left in that watery grave.

&quot;Buried with Him in baptism&quot;  (Colossians 2:13)

This is part of the conversion from one life to another, so that we may say, 
&quot;It is no longer I that lives, but Mashiah that lives in me&quot; (Galatians 2:20)
&quot;For he that has died has been freed from sin&quot; (Romans 6: 7)

3.  IN RESURRECTION
&quot;Just as Messiah was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in newness of life.  For if we have been planted in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection&quot;   (Romans 6: 4-5)

As Y'shua was raised by the Father as a spiritual man. so also should we rise up to walk in a new spiritual life.

In the Greek text, it is all in the past tense.   You also were raised with Him&quot;  (Colossians 2:12)
The fact is, you were raised when He was raised!

&quot;If any man be in Messiah, He is a new creation ... ... all things are become new&quot;   (2 Corinthians 5:17)

Baptism is a covenantal immersion into the new-creation man with all the rights and privileges endowed of sonship in the Father's kingdom.  It is The Elohim-Ordained entrance into the new covenant which will be attested to with supernatural signs.

===THE BAPTISM BY THE SPIRIT INTO Y'SHUA===
Yochannan had referred to Y'shua as the One who baptises with the Spirit, the Ruach HaKodesh  (John 1:32-34)

Although the Spirit came upon Him at His baptism in water, Y'shua Himself said afterward, &quot;I have a baptism to be baptised with&quot;  (Luke 12:50).  This was an immersion in the Spirit and Y'shua was held under the constraint of that until it was accomplished.   That was His literal baptism into death, burial and resurrection by the operation of the Spirit whereby He was raised a new creation Man, which is the basis of the new covenant.

His disciples in aspiring to sit on His right hand in the kingdom said they were able to be baptised with His baptism and Y'shua confirmed that they would indeed be partakers of that baptism.   (Matthew 20:20-23)  The disciples received that baptism at Pentecost, fifty days after His ascension to the right hand of the Father.  This baptism that Y'shua instituted for believers is a powerful immersion by the Spirit into the 'new-creation-man', Y'shua, to form the 'Body of Messiah'.

Through the Spirit we have been made to comprise one spiritual 'Body', called in scripture 'the Body of Messiah'   - 
&quot;For by one Spirit we were all baptised into one body - ...&quot;   &quot;Now you are the body of Messiah  ...   &quot;  (1 Corinthians 12:13,  27)

&quot;So we being many, are one body in Messiah&quot;   (Romans 12:5)

&quot;There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling;  one Lord, one faith, one baptism  ; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.&quot;   Ephesians  4:4-6)

We who have believed in Y'shua the Messiah have become through baptism, one spiritual body comprised of many members with varying gifts and ministries.  Together corporately we are Messiah's 'body' by the indwelling Spirit in fulfillment of Y'shua's prayer &quot;that they all may be one, as You Father, are in Me, and I in You, that they may be one in Us,&quot;   (John 17:21) The Body has been brought into unity in the same way that the Father was in Y'shua by the Spirit. The Father in Y'shua and the Father in us, as Paul also said,  'One Elohim and Father of all,  who is .....   .....  in you all'    (Ephesians 4:6) 

The indwelling Spirit is interchangeably called the Spirit of Messiah or the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh).  Y'shua said, &quot;When the Comforter comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father,  He will testify of Me,&quot;  (John 15:26) Y'shua sent the Spirit from the Father,  to take His place with the believers.   Resulting in us having fellowship with both the Father and the Son.

===ONE BAPTISM FOR BELIEVERS===
As Paul says in Ephesians 4:5  there is  ' one baptism '
The original ordinance of  Baptism in the apostolic era, was an immersion in water wherein the candidate was also baptised in the Spirit at the same time, thus effecting in one operation, what today has often been separated into two operations of the Spirit. As the candidate goes under the waters of baptism, the Spirit witnesses to their obedience and faith in Y'shua, and the immersion in water becomes also an immersion in the Spirit of God.  1 John 5: 6-8

As John says, the Spirit, the water and the blood agree together as witnesses on earth to the spiritual operation of the Father, the Word and the Spirit of God to enact the power of the sacrificial blood of the covenant in the believer's life.  

The natural element of water is a great solvent and purifier and Elohim uses the believer's immersion in it as a catalyst for the Spirit of God to operate and effect a spiritual washing and cleansing in the lives of those who undergo the waters of baptism. Through the effectual operation of the Spirit, by identification with Y'shua, the believer is reborn as a child of God and is baptised into His Body to become part of the spiritual kingdom of God as a new-creation man.

&quot;For you are all sons of God through faith in Messiah Y'shua.   
For as many of you as were baptised into Messiah have put on Messiah.&quot;  Galatians 3:26

      <text xml:space="preserve">===WHAT IS WATER BAPTISM?===
1. Obedience
An Act of Obedience to the revealed will of God in following Y'shua through the waters of baptism.

2. A Confession of Faith 	
An outward confession of an inner reality, a demonstration of having believed in one's heart in the work of atonement, confessing Y'shua as Lord of one's life and commencing to follow Him.

3. A Validation of Faith    	
The Father acknowledges us as His sons  (If you confess Me before men, I will confess you before My Father in heaven  Matt.10:32 &amp; Romans 10:13)
Angelic ministration is subscribed to us  (Luke 12:8 &amp; Psalm 91:11)

4. Remission of Sin 	
Cleansing by which forgiveness of sins is mediated and remission granted for them  (Acts 2:38) reconciliation with God is effected, our sins are 'loosed' (Greek, 'remit' = loose, send away),  and the power of sin loses its hold on us.

5. An Act of Identification with Y'shua in His Death and Resurrection.   We put our old life to death under the waters of baptism by faith in the operation of God to raise us up in the power of His Spirit in resurrection life.  (Colossians 2:12)

6. Cleansing from Sin	
Our conscience is cleansed and we are spiritually washed from our sins.  &quot;baptism doth now save us ... the answer of a good conscience toward God by the resurrection of Y'shua the Messiah&quot; 1 Peter 3:21 &amp; Hebrews 10:22
&quot;But ye are washed  ....&quot;   &quot;By the washing of regeneration&quot;  (1 Cor.6:11 &amp; Titus 3:5

7. Spiritual Circumcision     	
The Spirit  circumcises our heart - &quot;putting off the body of the sins of the flesh  ..   .. by the circumcision made without hands&quot;  (Colossians 2:11,12 &amp;Hebrews 4:12)
This circumcision is in the spirit  (Romans 2: 29 &amp; Philippians 3: 3)

8. New Nature - New Heart  
His laws are engraved upon our heart, which is now a heart of flesh (soft, tender to Him) Jeremiah 31:33  &amp;  2 Corinthians 3:3  
&quot;You are a new creation&quot;  (John 1:12 &amp; 2 Corinthians 5:17)	
&quot;For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection&quot;   Romans 6:5

9. Spiritual Adoption 	
Born of God - given the right to become sons of God.  (John 3: 3;  John 1:12), we are adopted into the family (Romans 8: 15-17),  &quot;The Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God, and if children, then heirs  -  &quot;  (Rom.8:16-17a)  &quot;to redeem those ..  ..  that we might receive the adoption as sons&quot;   (Galatians 4:5)

10. Sealed by the Spirit  	
Marked as God's possession, a guarantee of ownership  (Ephesians 1:13  &amp; 2 Corinthians 1:22)
Bought back from the enemy he no longer holds the title deed to our life, we have a spiritual inheritance.  Acts 20: 28 &amp; Ephesians 1:14  (the initial deposit on our lives)

11. New Identity &amp; Authority      
We are baptised into His Name and become a Messiah-in person (Messianic)  or a Christ-in person (Christian).  We have taken His name in covenant relationship and in that Name we have spiritual authority (Galatians 4: 6).  It is a spiritual union.  As in natural marriage, you take on another name and surrender your individual rights.
				
12. Spiritual Ministry	
We are placed in the Body.  &quot;For by one Spirit you are all baptised into one Body&quot;  (1 Cor.12:13)    			&quot;The assembly/ecclessia which is His body&quot;   (Ephesians 1: 22,23)
As individual members of that corporate spiritual body we each have differing functions and ministries imparted by the Spirit.

Y'shua established a new order of new creation sons of the Almighty,  through baptism.  The Jews were the first to enter into this sonship, and when entrance was given to the nations, they were not required to be circumcised first,  as was normally the practice for &quot;Gentiles&quot; entering the nation of Israel.   Acts 10; 11:18; 15:13-29;   Colossians 2:11-13;  Galatians 5: 1-6,11

===REQUIREMENTS FOR BAPTISM===
When undergoing immersion, faith has to be exercised in the atoning work of Messiah's blood sacrifice and the work of redemption, for oneself personally.  They have to believe that they have been reconciled to Yahweh God through Y'shua and have been brought back into relationship with Him.  Now as a child of God they are prepared to live in fellowship with the Father through Y'shua, His Son, and obey His commandments by the enabling of the holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh) of God which is given to them.  In this restoration into divine favour they need to fully identify with Y'shua in His death, burial and resurrection so that they may forsake the old pattern of life and fully yield to the life of Y'shua which is imparted to them.

After the candidate for baptism has made a confession of following Y'shua and prayer has been made for him, he undertakes to go into the water when he is ready in his heart, at sufficient depth so as to be able to be completely immersed when bending his torso at the waist and the knees.   This he does three times as a witness between God and man of his profession of faith.

Unlike the various styles of Christian baptism, in the Biblical/Hebraic practice the candidate himself initiates the act of burying their own life in identification with Y'shua's death, burial and resurrection under the Mikveh waters. The person officiating acts as an assistant to the candidate to receive their profession of faith and pray for them.

Early writings from the apostolic era indicate that prayer and fasting preceded baptism and that there was always a verbal profession of faith made by the candidate going under Baptism in a place where there was &quot;living water&quot;.   Leviticus 11:36

The Didache (Apostles doctrine), says, &quot;having first said all these things&quot;  which refers to the previous teaching of the apostles doctrine that involves the basics of 'the way of life'.  The Didache sets out the requirements for living in the 'Way', which is what some 'churches' have called 'catechism'  i.e. foundational doctrines.  
 
===THE 'DIDACHE'===  
(The Apostle's Doctrine, written 90 AD approx.)
&quot;Chapter 7. Concerning Baptism. And concerning baptism, baptize this way: Having first said all these things, baptize into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in living water. 
(The following passage is a suspected interpolation as it was customary to use only running water, and the following is Roman tradition)  
But if you have no living water, baptize into other water; and if you cannot do so in cold water, do so in warm. But if you have neither, pour out water three times upon the head into the name of Father and Son and Holy Spirit. 
But before the baptism let the baptizer fast, and the baptized, and whoever else can; but you shall order the baptized to fast one or two days before&quot;  (translated by Robertson)

This type of instruction seems to have been the practice of the early assemblies and it is supported in scripture.  The requirement for baptism was taught and also its meaning as is shown by the immediate response in each instance in the book of Acts and the desire to be baptised as soon as they had believed.

So, repentance was mandatory,
:so was	faith toward God,   -	&quot;if you believe with all your heart, you may (i.e. be baptised)  Acts 8:37
:then the necessary instruction  - as outlined in the Didache and evidenced in the preaching in Acts
:also 'living water' - this was Hebraic terminology for water which was either running as in a stream or river, or that had been collected from rainwater naturally as a pool or reservoir - not drawn from wells, dams or by human means.	As the eunuch said, &quot;See here is water, what hinders me .. ..&quot;  Acts 8:36

===METHOD OF BAPTISM===
====Complete Immersion====
The Greek word for baptise which we have taken an English derivative, is BAPTIZO which is the verb 'to immerse, plunge, put into or under'.  So by implication of the choice of word in the Greek, it is complete immersion.  This is substantiated by the early assembly practice.   &quot;John was baptising at Aenon because there was much water there&quot;  John 3:23  
Lydia, as an example, was near a river where prayer was made when she responded to the gospel and was baptised then. (Acts 16:13-15).  The disciples chose places where there was adequate water.
In Gaza, &quot;they went down into the water&quot;  and  &quot;they came up out of the water&quot;   Acts 8: 38.39

Complete immersion was standard Hebraic practice for ritual cleansing/baptisms.   Drawings discovered from that era in the catacombs, depict John standing at the riverside extending his arm in blessing toward the candidates who immersed themselves.  Early messianic writings substantiate the practice of immersing three times, which as a threefold witness.   

The type pictured in baptism is symbolic of death in a watery grave.  Partial immersion is only partial burial and so other forms of sprinkling etc. are not true to type.   Beware of men's traditions - Titus 1:14
Infant baptism is not scriptural as only an individual conscious of their sinful state can respond to baptism.

The mothers brought their children to Y'shua to be blessed by Him  (Matt.19:13-15).  In the Hebraic/scriptural order the babies were presented to Yahweh, but not till their coming of age were they accountable  (Ezek.18:20 - righteousness is not inherited).  Parents are responsible to bring up their children in the admonition of the Lord. so that when they are mature they will choose to follow Him. (Ephesians 6:4;  Deut.6: 6-9)

====In the Name of====
Matthew 28:19 says, &quot;baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&quot;
Yet in the Book of Acts we see the interpretation of this as, &quot;In the name of Y'shua Ha Maschiach/Jesus Christ.&quot;  Why the change?

Actually it is not a change.  
The name of the 'Father, Son and Holy Spirit' is interpreted as the One who represented them on earth and whose authority God endorsed.  He was given a name which is above every name that is named upon earth  (Philippians 2:8-10), that at that name every knee must bow.  That is, He has authority over everything on earth, in heaven and under the earth (the domain of 'hell'),  until the time when He has fulfilled the work of bringing all things into subjection to Himself, and then, at that time, He shall hand all things over to the Father, that He, Yahweh, may be all in all (1 Corinthians 15: 24-28).  Until then, what we do, we do in Y'shua's precious Name (Acts 4: 12)   'Father', 'Son' and 'Holy Spirit' are generic titles and not names.  Y'shua was the name of the Son who represented the Father and the Spirit.  
Note:  There is an indication that Matthew 28:19 was not in the original text, but a later addition.

Peter, entrusted with the 'keys of the kingdom' said, &quot;be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ/ Y'shua the Messiah&quot; Acts 2:38

The representative Name of the godhead in Hebrew is  Adonai, Y'shua Ha Maschiach, in our English translation Lord Jesus Christ. (Christ is the Greek for Messiah meaning 'anointed one')

The Name of the Son is Y'shua    Luke 1:31
The name of the Father is Yahweh   Exodus 3:15
The name of the Spirit is in His ministry of anointing Y'shua,  i.e. the Messiah/Christ  Acts 10:38 (it was the anointing that made Him the Messiah  1 Jn.2:20,27)

So in the Book of Acts we see the disciples/apostles using His representative name for the godhead as the 'formula' for baptism.  (Acts 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; 22:16)    Y'shua says in Luke that &quot;repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations&quot; Luke 24: 47

Note that the believers referred to themselves as being baptised into 'Christ'/ Messiah  (Romans 6:3). Y'shua said that He had come in His Father's name (John 5:43), and the Spirit is sent to us in Y'shua's name (John 14:26)  In Him dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily (Colossians 2:9) So the scriptural formula for being baptised is in the name of the Lord, Y'shua HaMaschiach.

Baptism is a covenant with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh)  represented by our Lord, Y'shua the Messiah. Baptism therefore is an immersion into all three persons of the godhead  -  i.e. into the fullness of the godhead. As Y'shua was the embodied fullness of the godhead, so also are we, although we as yet have not come into that fullness.  
We have the deposit of that and the final installment will be in the redemption of our bodies from mortality to immortality.  

Y'hsua in His earth life experienced relationship with the Father and the Spirit, so also we can enter into relationship with each individually.   John 17:20-23   &amp;  John 15:26,27;  16:13-15

====Laying on of Hands====
The Didache as well as apostolic writings mention prayer made with laying on of hands for candidates. In the scriptures with what is recorded, there does not seem to be a definite pattern, sometimes it is before and sometimes afterward, but it is seen to be a practice to pray and impart an anointing of the Spirit through the laying on of hands. (Ananias with Saul  Acts 9:17,  Paul with the Ephesians  Acts 19:1-5)

Baptism was regarded by the early Assembly as such an integral part of the new covenant that to fall away into sin or apostasy or to go into heresy, necessitated a re-immersion after full and complete repentance and restoration to the faith.  (study 6a)

It follows in order after repentance and faith, as one of the very foundational doctrines of the new covenant.  Hebrews 6: 1-2
 
&quot;Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, 
that we should be called the children of God.&quot;    1 John 3: 1

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of the book is a clear concise and complete guide to Classical Chinese Gardens for designers.  The book has three sections on the history and theory of the garden.  A second section of design patterns common to all gardens, all of the tools you will need to design a garden.  The final section shows all the construction techniques used to build a garden.  This books uses the pattern language approach to design


== History ==
The classical Chinese garden is the ancestor to all East Asian gardens.

== Design ==
The Chinese design was tightly regulated by the imperial adminstration.  Architecture was seen as a kit of standard parts that could be assembled in a number of possible ways.  Landscape architecture had more latitude but still followed general patterns of design.  From a design standpoint, these patterns can be used, much like architecture, as a kit of parts, that can be combined in multiple ways to express the intent of the designer.

=== patterns ===

*zigzag
*lightwell
*double passage
*framed single element
*major courtyard
*covered walk
*building transparency
*pond and grotto
*false termination
*leaked view window
*white field
*sunken groundplain
*poety wall
*planes of depth

== Construction ==


== working ==
elements of a Chinese garden:
*zigzag
*lightwell
*double hallway

by aligning the elements to a circulation frame work voids are created filled with tangent elements

activity: fins the motion paht identify all the target points and draw

Questions:
*who was the usr of the garden
*what program elements do they need
*is the design of the eves and crevices bad design or only asian
*what does a what whitewashed all mean for maitence is it a design failure
*what are the dimensions of a comfy couryard
*what about the degree of publicness?
*were they building a clubhouse
*were they creating their own civic institutions?
*what about degree of enclousre?
*when is a couryard not a courtyard by scale and by enclousre
*do I feel like I am leaving the world into a dream when I step into this space
*if the space is pleasant then why make it so?
*why was this material of whatever used here or located here, what is the logic?
*where are the control points of the design?
*what statements are being made?

Pattern: 
*contrast a single element from the total compositon
*create harmony by contrasting the opposites in sequence; dynamic equalibrium as seen in nature
*the scale is small so at ped. velocity the effect is unconcious due to the near-exposure effect
*three ways to lead the eye: 1)false termination with side passage:suprise 2)curved without end: compelling mystery 3)leakview screen:temptation
*intellectual symbolic structure
*major courtyard
*leakview window
*false terminate
*zigzag
*plant-rock balance
*covered walk
*building transparency
*small and large views
*light well
*suprise
*ground plane
*place of depth
*rain garden
*white field

the purpose of a chinese garden? it was the embellishment of a courtyard the user was a beurocrat and that is where the poetry came in b/c in ancient China an understanding of poetry was the equal of an IQ test it was the final word on the level of intellect and that is why you will see so many poems here in fact almost every place in the garden relates to poetry it is a garden built on poetry.  Chinese writing is a releic of the bronze age scribal clas had to work hard to learn all of the signs the writing is many times more complex than necessary for their job security.  the scholar class was a descendant of this class.  so their love of the writing system of words and poetry and calligraphy is natural even today so much time is spend in agonizing training is necessary to learn the system.  therefore all chinese are as proud of their langage as any group of specialists and it is as inacessible too.  Chinese humor is based on pun, homophony principals which extend into poetry.  even a painting must include a poem I hope you understand the primacy of poetry in design.

I want to discuss the frame first.  what is the context of this garden I want you to see it through the eyes of its user.  Historically, Chinese culture began thousands of years ago whena  military aristocracy what we would call warlords today enslaved thousands of neolithic villages the GDP of the villages funneled upwards into the du capitals from teh begining there were two elements the overlords and the servants after the unification of China the aristocracy relied on a third class of intellectuals to run things while they annexed new lands to the matrix at some point in the middle ages the intellectual class got the upperhand and ran the whole show at the time of the that powershift the gardens began to appear so lets look at the garden of one scholar.

the role of man and woman
why did chinese society keep women and men separate? there are proximal and ultimate reasons.  Ultimately there is no better love than forbidden love there is no better sex than forbidden sex.  how many illicit affairs began here?  how many moonlight sexual liasons?

the garden is a technology for shaping moods an emotional technology the use of sound see how these areas have been created  to isolate the sound of rain in stone on leaf on water in a way that is lost in nature, look at the use of color all the things have a small but automatic effect on emotion to soothe to stimulate by altering emotions enought of a mood can be built the garden of the mind alters the octave of impressions

the garden is fractal mystery within mystery as your eye follows soothing impressions, the real garden is the subjective one in your emotions

GIS analysis layers:
buildings by degree of enclousre
proportion between building and open space
courtyard scale lightwell court
courtyard proportions relative to height
nodes paths by degree of connectivity
sonic effects locations
viewshed types and degrees
hierarchy of building and court
fengshui positions
poetry locations
history of additions
plant symbolism
what are the patterns

== plants ==
In a Chinese garden the plant palette was restricted to about 100 species of which 20 were commonly used
*small gardens 10-20
*medium gardens 30-40
*large gardens 60-70

all plants had symbolic associations especially after the Cannon of Flowers by XXX

      <text xml:space="preserve">===OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT ===
The outpouring of the Spirit was at the feast of Pentecost, the 'Feast of Weeks' (Lev.23:15-23),  fifty days after Passover when Y'shua was offered as the sacrificial Lamb on our behalf.

It fulfilled the type illustrated in the feast.  They were to count the days from Passover and then offer the firstfruits of the wheat harvest to Yahweh.  Two loaves baked with leaven to symbolise the two houses of Israel, Judah and Ephraim not yet cleansed from sin. Yahweh had attempted to bring them into this covenant at Sinai, which was the first 'Pentecost'  (Ex.19:1- 3rd month) but they had run in fear from the manifestations of the Spirit and said, &quot;Let not God speak with us&quot;  (Exodus 20:18,19). 
 
Their disobedience and failure to enter in caused them to sin and come under judgment and as a result 3,000 souls died. Now, at this time, through the new covenant, Israel entered into it and 3,000 were saved on that day.

&quot;And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.  And also on My menservants and My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days&quot;    Joel 2:28,29  

This is a prophetic word given as a hope for the future restoration of Israel through the new covenant which He would establish with them.  He also says &quot;I will send you grain, and new wine and oil, and you will be satisfied with them&quot;  

These are spiritual types used - grain speaks of spiritual food, wine is the joy of the Spirit, and oil the anointing for ministry and service.  (Joel 2:19)  Joel's prophecy is of the impending judgment,  the time of Yahweh's future wrath and the deliverance/salvation from it for those who call on His Name.

John the Baptist prophesied regarding the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, saying &quot;He (Y'shua) shall baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire&quot;  (John 1:33), and he did this in the context of &quot;fleeing from the wrath to come&quot;  (Luke 3:7 &amp;17),  speaking of the fire (Yahweh's wrath) which would consume &quot;every tree which does not bear good fruit&quot;  (Luke 3: 9)  Luke further quotes John as saying, &quot;He will gather the wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire&quot;  ( Luke 3:`17)

John thus links the Baptism of the Holy Spirit as this outpouring of the Spirit on all flesh of which Joel prophesied before that great and terrible day of His wrath.  This is the salvation/deliverance by calling upon His Name.

Note. Joel uses the plural 'days', more than one prophetic 'day'  -  i.e. it spans from the birthing of the kingdom to the 'day' of it's full manifestation in the kingdom age.
Y'shua said, &quot;I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever - the Spirit of truth  .. ..&quot;  John 14:16,17.     

Y'shua prepared the disciples for this saying,
&quot;Wait for the promise of the Father, which He said, you have heard from Me, for John truly baptised with water, 		but you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&quot;  Acts 1: 4,5

On the great day of the feast, the day of the 'Great Hosanna'  at the pouring out of the water (which had been brought up from the Pool of Siloam for the ceremony) upon the altar,  Y'shua cried out,
&quot;He who believes in Me, as the scripture has said, out of his  heart will flow rivers of living water.   But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Y'shua was not yet glorified&quot;  John 7:37-39

At the time of this prayer ceremony for natural water for the harvest,  Y'shua spoke of the rivers of living water which were to flow from the throne of Yahweh for all who were thirsty, to come and drink.
&quot;For with stammering lips and another tongue He will speak to this people, to whom He said, 'This is the rest with which you may cause the weary to rest,'  And, 'this is the refreshing';&quot;   (Isaiah 28:11).  Peter interprets this manifestation on the day of Pentecost as a fulfillment of this scripture, calling them to repent, &quot;so that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.&quot;  (Acts 3:19). Peter thus establishes that the manifestation of the Holy Spirit in 'tongues' is the prophesied 'stammering lips and another tongue'  through which the times of refreshing would come from the presence of Yahweh,  of which Isaiah spoke, concerning these times of refreshing to come. Paul also confirms that the manifestation of tongues is confirmed by this scripture.   1 Corinthians 14:21

We have therefore two apostolic confirmations of tongues being the prophesied manifestation of Isaiah 28:11.

===THE SEAL OF THE COVENANT===
The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the seal of the new covenant. Yahweh always gives those who enter into covenant with Him a seal as  a guarantee of the promises made.  To Abraham He gave the seal of circumcision.  Romans 4:11

A seal always has an outward manifestation, the Spirit's manifestation is in the various gifts.  1 Corinthians 12:7-11

A Seal signifies:
1. A finished transaction  Jeremiah 32:9,10
2. Ownership   Jeremiah 32:11,12; 2 Timothy 2:19
3. Security  Ephesians 4:30

&quot;In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise &quot;   (Ephesians 1:13)

&quot;Who also has sealed us and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee&quot;  2 Corinthians 1:22
and,  &quot;hereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption&quot;   Ephesians  4:30
The seal of the Spirit is in the form of a deposit, a down-payment, an initial installment of the fullness to come in the kingdom age which will be the full inauguration of the new covenant.  Now, we are pressing into the kingdom and entering into our inheritance as sons,  forerunners and potential firstfruits of the harvest.   2 Corinthians 5: 4, 5

We are  -  &quot;Made partakers of the world to come and have tasted  the good word of God and the powers of the  world to come.&quot; Hebrews 6: 4-5
The Holy Spirit is given to bring us into the powers of the age to come.   Ephesians 1:13-14

Paul describes the experience of being sealed with the Spirit as &quot;the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession&quot;   (Ephesians 1:14).  The word 'earnest' means a 'pledge' or 'an assurance'.

Paul is referring to a custom wherein if a man purchased a field he would take a spade full of earth from the land as a pledge that he owned the land and would be back to take full possession of it in the future.
The baptism in the Holy Spirit is the proof that we have received a portion of the inheritance of the new covenant power and glory.   The immersion (baptism) in the Spirit  is the earnest or pledge from Yahweh that the whole inheritance has been legally enacted and the believer is entitled to it when Y'shua returns, if he endures to the end.

===THE HOLY SPIRIT OPERATION IN BAPTISM===
It is the Holy Spirit (the Ruach HaKodesh) Who moves over our lives to cause us to turn to Yahweh.  It is His ministry to convict us of sin and Who breathes new life into our hearts, immersing us into the Body of Y'shua.

Being a manifestation of the godhead,  He has personality and is described as such.  He is the presence and power of Yahweh and  Y'shua speaks of Him in the personal pronoun 'ekeinos', as for the personal representation of the Father.

He can be Grieved - Ephesians  4:30				
:Vexed - Isaiah 63:10			
:Resisted - Acts 7:51			
:Provoked - Hebrews 3: 7-9			
:Insulted - Hebrews 10:29			
:Lied to - Acts 5: 3			
:Tempted - Acts 5: 9			
:Blasphemed - Mark 3:28-30; Matt.12:31-32 &amp; Luke 12:10


He knows the things of Yahweh -	1 Corinthians 2:11  Isaiah 40:13
He searches all things - 1 Corinthians 2:10
He performs the work of Yahweh - Genesis 1: 2; Job 33: 4; John 3: 5; Romans 8:11
He convicts of sin - John 16: 8-11
He speaks - Acts 13:2;  28:25-27 - Isaiah 6: 8-10
He teaches and instructs the believers - John 14:26; 16:13-15
He distributes the gifts - 1 Corinthians 12:11
He comforts/Counsels/helps - John 14:15
He Guides - John 16:13
He gives revelation - 1 Corinthians 2: 9-11; John 14:20; 15:26; 16:13
He glorifies Y'shua - John 16:14

===PURPOSE OF THE SPIRIT BAPTISM IN THE BELIEVER===
TO REVEAL Y'SHUA   
'''To Us'''
It is the ministry of the Spirit to bring to darkened hearts and minds the reality of Y'shua, that the eyes of their understanding may be enlightened 2 Corintians 4: 3-6; Ephesians 1:18  

To also bring Revelation from the scriptures  1 Corinthians 2:12, to know the things given to us
Guides us into truth  John 16:13   Teach and bring things to mind  John 14:26; 1 Corinthians 2:13 			
Personal guidance and direction  Acts 13: 2; Mark 13:11

'''In Us'''   	
Gives inspiration for worship  John 4:24  Philippians 3: 3;  Ephesians 5:18-20
Divine strength through His love poured out in our heart   Romans 5: 3-5. 
The life of Messiah in us, working out through our personality, is called the fruit of the Spirit  Gal. 5:21-22   &amp;  John 17:26

'''Through Us''' 	 
There is an empowering of the Spirit  -  &quot;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you&quot; (Acts 1:8), and be &quot;endued with power from above&quot;  (Luke 24:49)
Previously they had authority in His Name, now effectual power is released through them
Now, 'they turned the world upside down' Luke 10:18-20  &amp;  Acts 1: 8: 17: 6 

They had -	
Power to witness -  Acts 1:8; 4:33
Power to Preach the Word  -  Acts 4:31; 9:20
Power of Agape love - Acts 7:60; Romans 9: 1-3;  5:3-5 
Power in prayer  -   Jude 20   Ephesians 6:18   Spirit directs in prayer, He makes intercession for us, enabling us to pray according to God's will  Romans 8:26-27
Spiritual gifts (charisma)  -  1 Corinthians 14: 1; 12: 5
Spiritual impartation of gifts for ministry - Ephesians 4: 7-8; 11-12
				
&quot;These signs shall follow them that believe: in My Name they shall cast out demons, they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means  hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover.&quot;  

&quot;And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word through the accompanying signs.&quot;	Mark 16: 17,18, 20
In the outworking of the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit's) impartation to the believers there are dramatic changes in their lives and ministries.  Peter, one who even denied Messiah beforehand, now preaches boldly in the temple, they are like men filled with new wine.	(Acts 2:14-39, v. 15)

The Spirit of Yahweh lifted them beyond the natural into the 'supernatural'
in their preaching - Acts 3: 8;  6:10
in their praying - Acts 4:31
in their guidance - Acts 8:29, 26;  9:10
in transportation - Acts 8:39
in protection/deliverance - Acts 12: 7;  28: 5
in miracles - Acts 5:12-15;  6: 8;  8: 6,7
in visions - Acts 7:55

Paul preached the gospel &quot;In mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God&quot;   Romans 15:19
As did the other apostles  Acts 2:43; 5:12,  also Phillip the evangelist 8:13, and Ananias, a brother (Acts 9:17-18).

&quot;God bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will&quot; (Hebrews 2: 4).   In all, they had evidence of something beyond the natural capabilities of man, theirs was not normal preaching, teaching and praying, it was the 'dunamis' power of Yahweh released in mortal vessels by the Holy Spirit.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE PURPOSE OF TONGUES===
An examination of scripture reveals that there were five occasions in the Book of Acts where believers received the Holy Spirit (the Ruach HaKodesh) and on each occasion there is the manifestations of the Spirit in tongues.

Acts 2: 4  &quot;they began to speak with tongues&quot;
Acts 8:17  &quot;when he saw that through the laying on of hands the Holy Spirit was given&quot;  (i.e. he saw some evidence)
Acts 9:17  &quot;be filled with the Holy Spirit&quot; and the result was Paul spoke with tongues as he testifies
Acts 10:46  &quot;they heard them speak with tongues&quot;
Acts 19: 6  &quot;they spoke with tongues and prophesied&quot;

&quot;Tongues&quot; is the outward sign of having received the Holy Spirit, an evidence of supernatural manifestations. As people are immersed in the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) the natural outflow is to speak in heavenly languages and glorify Yahweh, as it is an avenue of worship which bypasses the natural mind of man and enables worship to flow from his spirit to God, Who is Spirit.   &quot;God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth&quot;  John 4:24

In bypassing man's mind and natural emotions, there is a release in the spirit of man and spiritual energy flows through from the Spirit of Yahweh to lift man's spirit to soar into the spiritual realm,   i.e. into the kingdom of heaven.  It is the means of 'breaking into' the spiritual realm.  

The natural man does not comprehend the things of the Spirit (1 Corinthians 2:14), only through his spirit can he enter in.  The natural mind can be a hindrance in receiving the things of the Spirit of God.   This immersion is the initial step in 'quickening' - making alive the spirit of man which had fallen asleep in spiritual death at the fall with Adam.

It is also to empower the believer for witness, testimony and service  (Acts 1: 8) and to continue the ministry of Y'shua on the earth (John 14:12); also to aid our personal devotional life  (Romans 8:26)

The personal gift  enables one to maintain their spiritual life through the energising power imparted by it,   
&quot;But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God&quot;  Jude 20, 21

===THE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT===
Examining the Book of Corinthians  -  Summary and Commentary
Most of Paul's instruction regarding 'tongues' was to correct error and not systematic instruction in the gifts, which he obviously did with each group when he first established them in the faith,  so some re-construction is necessary from what is written to understand their practice of the gifts in their normal function.

Chapter 12 - the Catalogue of the Gifts
12: 1	Ignorance of spiritual gifts is not Yahweh's desire nor Paul's intention.  To be ignorant of the gifts is to be without the intended spiritual equipment for the new-creation-man life.

12: 3	The true test of authenticity in the manifestation of a gift is the Lordship of Y'shua the Messiah  (1 John 4: 1-3). The Spirit will always glorify Y'shua  (John 16:14)

12: 4-6  There are a variety of gifts ministered in different ways, with varying purposes but they are all manifestations of the one Spirit, overseen by the Lord of the 'Ecclessia'/Church, the head of the assembly, and the one God whose power is demonstrated through them all.
All of Yahweh's gifts are by His grace (His impartation of spiritual enabling), they are not a mark of personal attainment or spirituality.  The Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) distributes as He wills, not as man desires.

12: 7-11 Paul lists the nine gifts of the Spirit. These are often categorised as follows -
Gifts of Revelation
Wisdom
Knowledge
Discernment

Gifts of Power/Demonstration	
Faith
Healings
Miracles

Gifts of Proclamation/Vocal	
Prophecy (inspiration)
Tongues
Interpretation	

These are all different expression of the same Spirit according to His ministry to the Body of Y'shua. They are given  vs.7 &amp; 8, and operated by faith.  All are encouraged to operate the gifts in verse 11

12:12-27 Paul addresses the need for unity in the Body.  The Corinthians Assembly were yet carnal and the operating of the gifts had been with fleshly motivations.  Paul teaches them in verse 18 that Yahweh sets the members in the Body as it has pleased Him, the weak, 'uncomely' and strong are all necessary for the growth of the Body. Yahweh's desire is to see that there is no divisions, but rather mutual love and care between all the members of the Body.  Differing gifts, ministries and methods of operation do not elevate one above another.

12: 28-31  While Yahweh has set differing offices in the Assembly, not everyone has the same function.  Note v.28  that  He has set tongues in the Assembly.  What He has set in the Body no man can remove.

Chapter 13 --   The Motivation of the Gifts
The love chapter placed between the gifts balances the gifts by the motive and manner in which they should be conducted.  Maturity as well as unity is needed for the operation of the gifts.  Love is essential to maintain the bond of unity.   The maturity of love is giving rather than receiving, to bless rather than to be blessed, to see others helped rather than to be helped oneself.

The point is to not use the release of the Spirit for personal gain, but to bless the whole Body and for that, to seek the best, the most appropriate gift to achieve that object, according to the need.

13: 1-3	If not operated in the right spirit born out of love, they are offensive and of no personal benefit or value.

13: 4-8	The many facets of love are described in negative and positive aspects.   Compare Galatians 5:22-23

13:8-13	The permanency of love demonstrates its superiority over the gifts of the Spirit.  Love is age-enduring whereas the manifestations of the Spirit are for this age only and shall cease to be needed when that which is perfect is come.  Then the knowledge of Yahweh shall fill all the earth (Habukkuk 2:14)

Chapter 14   --  The Operation of the Gifts
14: 1	Follow after/pursue love as well as desiring spiritual gifts,  One does not replace the other.  The word 'desire' in Greek means to earnestly desire, to covet, be jealous for. In the pursuit of love we are to covet gifts that will edify the Body - the motive is to be of love to benefit our brethren.  (See 12:31)

14: 2	The person speaking in tongues speaks to Yahweh and not man, therefore the Body is not directly benefited. We speak mysteries in the Spirit and one's own spirit is edified.  v.4

14: 3	He who prophesies speaks intelligible things to edify man.  Prophecy is an inspired utterance, to speak on Yahweh's behalf in the areas of edification, exhortation and comfort.

14: 4	Speaking in tongues is edifying to one's own spirit.  As a dynamo charges a battery, so speaking in tongues builds spiritual power and strength within the spirit of a believer.

14: 5	Paul here establishes several truths - 
:he wants everyone to speak in tongues
:he would rather they prophesy in assembly
:prophecy is greater than tongues
:prophecy equals tongues + interpretation

14: 6-11  Paul instructs those speaking, to do so in ways understood by all.

14:12-13 In pursuing and following after spiritual gifts, do it for the edifying of the Body. If you speak in tongues go on to 	interpret the utterance you have had. Move on from the exhilaration of having the Ruach HaKodesh speak through you, onto the concern for the edification of the Body.

14:14-17 Paul's own testimony of the operation of the Spirit through him  - singing and praying in tongues
- praying and singing in the Spirit
- praying and singing in ... (English)
	
Paul thus establishes tongues are an aid to prayer
:::::tongues are an aid to worship
:::::tongues add a new dimension to prayer and worship
:::::tongues are not exclusively used for these things
:::::tongues used exclusively is imbalance
:::::tongues are activated by the individual's own will.
::::::(but they spoke as the Spirit gave utterance  (Acts 2: 4)

14:18-20  Paul says that he speaks with tongues more than them all - that was his source of power for ministry. But in the assembly he would rather speak only five words in their own tongue that all may be edified. Paul is referring to his personal gift as against the ministry gift of tongues in the assembly
             
14:21-22  In v.21 Paul quotes from Isaiah 28:11,12 as it being a sign for unbelievers.  This occurred at Pentecost when 	unbelieving Jews heard the phenomena and were converted.

14:23-25  In open meetings, with unbelievers present, the gifts should be to bring conviction and not to confuse

14:26	Instruction on the meetings to include a balance of singing, teaching, exhortation, prophesy and tongues for the edification of all.  Each individual is to seek Yahweh and come prepared to worship

14:27-33  The gifts operate at the discretion of the individual and therefore the ministry gift of tongues should be not be used if no one is able to interpret.  All gifts are subject to being judged  v.29 and must agree with the Word, i.e. 'prove all things'  (1 Thessalonians 5:21)

14:34-35 This was instruction relative to a current situation in that assembly, it must be qualified with other scripture such as
&quot;I would that you all spoke with tongues&quot;   (14:5)
&quot;Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy&quot;  (Acts 2:17,18 &amp; Joel 2:28)
&quot;Let everything that has breath praise Yahweh&quot;  (Psalm 150: 6)

14:36-40  Considering they were over emphasising gifts, Paul's instruction is very strongly toward their continuance.  He 	makes three main points  -
1. Covet to Prophesy but don't stop speaking in tongues
2. Forbid not to speak with tongues even though it had been abused
3. Everything to be done in order and in a proper manner 

'''In Romans'''
&quot;I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift&quot;  Romans 1:11

'''To Timothy'''
&quot;Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of hands of the presbytery&quot;  &quot;Wherefore I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift (charisma) of God, which is in you by the laying on of my 	hands&quot;  	1 Timothy 4:14 &amp; 2 Timothy 1: 6

'''In Hebrews'''  
The laying on of hands to impart gifts is cited as a basic doctrine of the Assembly   Hebrews 6: 2  &quot;doctrine of baptisms,  of laying on of hands,&quot;  compare  2 Tim.1: 6;  4:14;  Rom.1:11

'''To the Galatians'''
&quot;Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&quot;  
&quot;Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?&quot;     Galatians 3:2, 5

'''To the Ephesians'''
&quot;And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord.&quot; Ephesians 5:18,19  -  compare with 1 Cor,14:15  -    Praying with the Spirit and with the understanding.
and Colossians 3:16	 -   Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to God.

'''To the Thessalonians'''
&quot;Quench not the Spirit&quot;         
&quot;Despise not prophesyings&quot;
&quot;Prove all things&quot;  1 Thessalonians 5:19-21 

=====The Initial Outpouring - Book of Acts=====
&quot;These signs shall follow those that believe; ... ... they shall speak with new tongues&quot; Mark 16:17
which was fulfilled in Acts 2: 4 where it says,
&quot;And they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance&quot;
They began to speak - as the Spirit gave them utterance.

This was the manifestation of them being filled with the Spirit. Their heart had been prepared by ten days of waiting in the upper room in accordance with and in obedience to Y'shua's instruction.  Having been taught by Him to expect this infilling,  they were hungry to receive the promise of the Father.

&quot;In the law it is written:  With men of other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people&quot;  1 Corinthians 14:21

::Okay, I know I'm just talking to myself, here, but this is the discussion page and I'd like to discuss this if there's anyone who knows Ido and is willing to argue about this with me. The way I see it, the number system seems to be a perverse compromise instead of a system based on logic. Considering the esoteric nature of this constructed language and its purpose as an uber reformed and logical language, it seems that this number system is out of place. Why not use, for instance, the International System (SI) as the basis for numbers? (Deka, Centa, Kila, Mega, Giga, Tera, Peta, Exa, Zeta, Yota, etc.) I'll admit, I don't know Ido, but I hardly have much compunction about suggesting a reform to something that gives me serious pause about progressing further. With so few speakers it's hardly out of line or impossible to change. This number system flies in the face of being a logical constructed language when it's holding onto an old world 'big thousand' miliardo. Come on, this is the industrial age, and most of the world uses metric, so how is it not logical to base a constructed language's number logic on that system?

I would propose a system something more like this:

0 Nil (Or Nul, whatever. Not important.)

1 Un

2 Du

3 Tri

4 Quar

5 Kin

6 Sis

7 Sep

8 Ok

9 Non


10 Deka

11 Deka-un

12 Deka-du

13 Deka-tri


20 Duas  (or some inflection of Du so that they aren't saying two tens, unique names for multiples of ten are useful.)

21 Duas-du


100 Centa

539 Kincenta Trias-non  (Or similar inflections.)

1000 Kila

1,000,000 Mega

1,000,000,000 Giga

'''Concept: Technological Momentum'''

&quot;What is striking is how this effort continued so naturally after the initial impetus was removed. In a meeting shortly after V-E Day with some physicists who felt that perhaps the effort should stop, Oppenheimer argued to continue. His stated reason seems a bit strange: not because of the fear of large casualties from an invasion of Japan, but because the United Nations, which was soon to be formed, should have foreknowledge of atomic weapons. A more likely reason the project continued is the momentum that had built up - the first atomic test, Trinity, was nearly at hand.&quot;

'''
Key concepts: Scalar difference, quantiative and qualitative difference.''' See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition phase transitions] for Much Deeper Context

Designing nanosystems means thinking on a different physical scalar level. This can make things difficult for us to conceive and imagine, yet these physics of scalar difference can perhaps help us think on the ontological scale. In this week we will focus on an introduction to nanotechnology here at the local scale of Penn State, and with the help of some visionary arts, we will begin to visualize the qualitative as well as quantitative shifts involved in scalar difference. Here are some resources for helping you think in scalar terms, and to offer our collective work on a global scale:

&quot;What could we do with layered structures with just the right layers? What would the properties of materials be if we could really arrange the atoms the way we want them? They would be very interesting to investigate theoretically. I can't see exactly what would happen, but I can hardly doubt that when we have some control of the arrangement of things on a small scale we will get an enormously greater range of possible properties that substances can have, and of different things that we can do.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Much of '''etiquette and courtesy''' falls under [[/Driving/Safety/Traffic law|traffic law]], but some may or may not in your area.  In any case, it's a good idea to keep all drivers aware of your intentions on the road, and enable them to drive safely by courteous action.

== Driver awareness ==
A driver should keep other drivers appraised of his position and intentions on the road.  This is accomplished by using all signals properly and keeping the vehicle visible to drivers around you.  Surprise maneuvers and blind vehicles cause major accidents simply by not allowing other drivers to compensate for your actions or simple existence.

=== Signaling ===
In most places, traffic law dictates that a driver must signal to lane change, make a turn, or parallel park.  In most places, police ignore this anyway, so nobody (even the police) does it.  Some people don't even understand what signals are for, particularly when parallel parking; these drivers will occasionally yell and use their horn when a driver in front of them stops and signals to park, instead of going around the driver so that he can back up into the spot.

Proper signaling should be done several seconds before actually taking action, but not so long as to cause confusion.  In general, three to four seconds should give other drivers enough time to process and react to the signal.

For turns and parallel parking, the signal should be activated while approaching the intersection or pulling up next to the parking spot.  The flow of traffic should be clear before actually executing these maneuvers; turns cross traffic, and parallel parking tilts the front outer corner of the car outward.

For lane changes, the signal should be activated several seconds before actually changing lanes.  Additional checks should be performed just before actually executing the lane change to assure no other vehicles occupy the space being moved into.  The driver should also verify the speed difference between lanes and take appropriate action during the maneuver to adjust.  Once the lane change has been completed, the driver should cancel the signal to avoid confusing other drivers.

Importantly, drivers must respect other drivers' signals when on the road.  If another driver signals to change into your lane, '''do not pass'''.  In many cases, a driver will intentionally speed up to prevent another driver from getting in front of him; this causes congestion when drivers brake to get behind an aggressive driver.  In the worst case, the driver may not notice the sudden change in vehicle speed, and then subsequently collide with a vehicle in his blind spot.  In any case, preventing a driver from properly changing lanes may make it more difficult for that driver to take an upcoming turn or exit, distressing the driver and leading to more erratic driving, and possibly accidents.

=== Positioning ===
Drivers must keep their cars positioned in such a way to remain visible to other drivers.

* Do not ride blind spots.
* Don't ride to the right of or directly behind large trucks.
* SUVs cannot see the space around them as well.
* Don't pass on the right; cars passing on the right seem to come out of nowhere!

==Version for solo guitar==
For this song, there is a solo guitar book version in C major. If you want to keepthe F major tonality, you needa Capo on the 5th Guitar fret. &lt;ref&gt;To listen to the midis we recommend  [http://www.vanbasco.com/karaokeplayer/  Karaoke Player of vanBasco].  It's a very good midi player that can slow down the piece and pitch the tonality to F-major.&lt;/ref&gt;

 this text have to be translated into English
 
The melody of this traditional music has been used also for the love song Love Me Tender. By the interpretation of Elvis Pressly that old tune again gained new popularity.

The basic harmonies of the piece are relatively simple.
The extended chords be produced by the additional melody notes. These were actually integrated in the accompaniment.

Very often harmonies that come only through the notes of the melody reached, will no extra named.
But it is worthwhile to analyze the harmonic structure of this song closely, and uses the standard chord combinations to memorize it.

Some few additional harmonies such as (VI) II-VI progresson, or intermediate dominants and    chains of dominants  gives this folk-song a very jazzy  character. Some Septim chords that you would use for a piano version, or in a pure chord accompaniment are harmoniously simplified for ease of playability.


To become the chords easier into your hands, some similar fretted chords been included for comparison. These auxiliary harmonies are indeed in  the chord list (with brackets), but don't appear on the actual song.

A homemade steak sauce finishes this meal all off. The sauce sure is better than that A1 stuff.

== Ingredients ==
*1/4 cup black peppercorns, cracked
*4 (6-ounce) boneless strip steaks, trimmed of excess fat
*Salt
*Olive oil
*1/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
*1/4 cup cognac
*3 tbs heavy cream
*2 cloves garlic, smashed and minced

== Procedure ==
#Sprinkle garlic with salt. Press with the side of the knife repeatedly until garlic forms a thick paste.
#Rub steaks with oil. Season on both sides with salt, then press pepperorns into both sides of meat. Let sit until room temperature, about 30 minutes.
#Heat a stainless steel skillet large enough to hold the steaks over high heat. Pour some oil into the pan, then add steaks. Cook 4 minutes per side for medium rare. Remove and keep warm.
#Pour out excess fat but do not scrape pan. Deglaze pan with cognac, then turn off heat and ignite with a firestick. Shake pan until flames die.
#Bring to a boil. Cook until reduced by half, then whisk in cream and garlic.
#Whisk in butter. Once butter has melted completely, spoon over steaks. Serve immediately.

== Warnings ==
 
When you make this dish, and ignite it, you are essentially playing with fire, something that your mom didn't recommend. Always remember, keep a fire extinguisher around, and if you have a gas stove, turn off the heat.</text>

'''Third version:''' a modification of the prior version, modeling the host opening a door and the player making the second choice, the same way the first version does. Even though the prior version is not a formal, proper or full modeling, it has the same effect in terms of computing, because we can check that the line &quot;win += 1 if choice2 == car&quot; is the same as &quot;win += 1 if choice1 != car&quot;, making the choice2 information unnecessary. 

In fact, ''given the first choice, the game is already decided for a switching player''. This means that the full modeling (first, fourth and this version) is not necessary (or even ''concise'') at all: if the player initially chooses the right door, for sure he loses after switching (because he is leaving the right door); if he chooses the wrong door, for sure he wins after switching (because the right door is the only one to switch to - the other one is opened by the host). As we already have the result of the current game after checking the first choice, ''we don't need to artificially compute it again by explicit simulation of the other events'': it would be simply redundant. 

This all means that the proper, full modeling of the Monty Hall problem can be abstracted to a more concise and simpler form. The full modeling becomes just ''an instance'' of the simplest one. Fifth version implements such a simplest abstraction, while the second and fourth ones work as intermediary simplifications. First and third versions even though proper descriptions of the scenario, are not computationally efficient in terms of good, non-redundant abstraction. In fact, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring refactoring] of all the versions from first to fourth leads to the fifth one, because all versions are equivalent, differing only in the levels of abstraction and redundancy.

Another way to express the difference from the intermediary to the full modelings is that the full ones run a simulation ''from the player's perspective'': he will only know whether his initial choice was right or not in the end of each game. However, we can run a more concise (even though ''abstracted'', that is, not specifically describing the original scenario anymore) simulation using ''the host's perspective'': we can take advantage of the fact that we can check if the first choice is correct, so that we can already know the result, without having to execute any additional steps. This may become clearer in the fourth example below.

Actually, if we think that the Monty Hall problem can be reduced to simply checking the success rate of many times picking up two elements out of three and checking them against an expected one, we can conclude that all the versions from first to fourth are redundant in some level, even if they are modeling the problem completely or correctly. Even in the simplest form, we can deduce that the more repetition and randomness we have, the more closer to 2/3 the result is inclined to be. From this point of view, ''any computer simulation of Monty Hall problem is pointless at all''. Computer simulations are used where a complete enumeration of all possible states would be prohibitive or impossible&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation#Computer_simulation Computer simulation on Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;, which is not the case of Monty Hall problem.

Note: the reason why the algorithms can't be reduced to a single &quot;print 2/3&quot; is because the output ''depends on the number of times the game is played, and on the randomness of either the right door, or the player's choice''. For example, for only 10 games it is unlikely that the success rate will keep at 2/3 for all runnings of the simulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE GIFTS===
The gifts of the Spirit are the very essence of the Ruach HaKodesh Himself working through a believer to display the divine attributes of the Godhead and meet the needs of man.

&quot;Now concerning spiritual gifts brethren,  I don't want you to be ignorant  .. &quot;    1 Corinthians 12: 1

The word 'gifts' here is not in the original,  and so it is written in italics in the NKJ version as used here. The subject is 'spiritual things' or 'things of the Spirit'. Emanations may be a more appropriate word to use.

In verse 7 of the same chapter the word 'manifestation' of the Spirit is used.   'Manifestation is 'PHANEROSIS' and means 'shining forth' or &quot;flashing out' - i. e. supernatural projections of the Spirit breaking through into the natural realm.

Two terms are used in these instructional chapters on the operations of the Holy Spirit.
They are:
PNEUMATIKA	literally meaning 'spirituals' or spiritual emanations
and  CHARISMA	meaning 'grace', 'favour', 'gift'

When 'gifts' is inserted in italics in the text, the word in Greek is 'pneumatikos'  -  spiritual emanations
This is the case in 1 Corinthians12: 1; 13: 2; 14: 1; 14:12
When 'gifts' is in normal print, the word in Greek is 'charisma',  a gift in the sense of a manifestation of the Spirit.
This is used in 1 Corinthians 12: 7-10 ;  12:31

Thus the emanations of the Spirit operate through the believers to minister to the body.  They never become 'gifts' in the sense that they become the possession of the person operating them. The 'gifts' (emanations) of the Spirit cannot be received, possessed or operated at will independently of the Ruach HaKodesh. A believer can operate all the 'gifts' of the Spirit or he may specialise in one or two which he feels more comfortable with, but it will always be as He, the Ruach 'wills'  (verse 11). They are gifts operating  through the agency of the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) and are not related to natural talents and abilities.

Every Spirit-filled believer has the potential capacity for every manifestation of the Spirit, as a channel through which the will and purposes of Yahweh can be effected to build up the Body of Messiah.

The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for the  profit of all (1 Corinthians 12: 7)
Note.  Manifestation is singular, the 'gifts' are not manifestations (plural) of the Spirit, but they are a manifestation of Himself in taking the things of Messiah and expressing them to us in various forms.

The Father has given the Spirit to us as a Comforter/Counsellor.  As part of this role, He takes the things of Messiah and reveals them to us, giving us understanding of Messiah Himself.   But then, having shown us the glory of Messiah it becomes the desire of the Spirit to manifest through us the ministry of Messiah and make us participants in His ministry to the Body and to the world.  To do this the Spirit brings to the believers 'diversities of gifts' so that through them they can act as the Body of Messiah  -  the expression of Himself on the earth.    John 14:12

&quot;However, when He the Spirit of truth is come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears he will speak; and He will tell you things to come.   He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is mine and declare it to you.&quot;     John 16:13-14

&quot;There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.  And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all.&quot;    1 Corinthians 12: 4-6

Diversities of gifts (charismaton - manifestations)- Holy Spirit's ministry
Differences of Ministries - Y'shua, the Head and Administrator of the Body
Diversities of Activities (lit. energies or workings) - God the Father of all, Who is over all and in all

The Holy Spirit gives expression to the ministry of Messiah at His direction,  by the energising power of the Father.There are many forms of expression of the manifestations, ministries and the effectual workings of the Father's power to effect them, but all are in an established order and according to the divine purpose for each member and the Body as a whole.

===OPERATION OF THE GIFTS===
The nine gifts are usually categorised into sets of three	VOCAL/INSPIRATIONAL  GIFTS
POWER GIFTS
REVELATION GIFTS

1.  The Inspirational Gifts,  the utterances of the Holy Spirit include	Prophecy
Tongues
Interpretation

These are under the control of the human will and therefore can be used wisely or foolishly, or can be withheld from use. They can be contaminated by the person's own spirit by unforgiveness causing bitterness, erroneous doctrines and/or perceptions, limited understanding/knowledge of spiritual realities and of truth, thus distorting the message.

Prophecy in particular needs to be judged, the sphere of prophecy is in encouragement, exhortation and edification.  It is not usual for prophecy to be used to foretell the future as it does not contain revelation, and it is definitely not intended for the correction of error in other members of the Body

It takes faith to step out and operate these gifts and yield the faculties of voice, mind and will to the motivations of the Spirit flowing along and allowing Him to use one's self to speak forth a message to edify others.  
Tongues and Interpretation are a couplet.   Speaking in tongues in this manifestation is a powerful 'voice' expression for the Ruach HaKodesh to carry the energising influence of His presence in a gathering of believers, but it must be interpreted for understanding, and it will not be expressed in a word for word translation, but an interpretation of the general meaning.

2. The Power Gifts are demonstrations of the power of the Spirit.  	Faith
Healings
Miracles

These demonstrations of the kingdom convince man of the reality of God and are a necessary part of outreach.

The Gift of Faith is a supernatural impartation of the Holy Spirit for a specific purpose or need in situations above the normal faith level of the individual.  It may serve the purpose of prayer,  guidance or to meet a circumstantial need.

Healings -  is in the plural, as there are many manifestations of healing gifts, this is supernatural and not that which originates from natural sources.  It can be through laying on of hands, anointing with oil, prayer, a rhema word or anointed cloths.

Miracles are an intervention into the natural world overiding natural laws and principles,  to change the course of nature and natural circumstances through a demonstration of His power.

3.  The Revelation Gifts imparting to the believer divine insight	Discerning of spirits
Word of Wisdom	
Word of Knowledge

These are impartations to the believer, not through the believer, and therefore the exercise of them is subject to specific guidance. They are not necessarily spoken out, they may just be for personal guidance in ministry.

Discerning of spirits is not natural discernment.  It is of spirits  It operates in three areas - divine, human and satanic to discern what forces are at work in another person or situation.  The purpose is to give knowledge and wisdom for direction.

Word of Knowledge - a word of revelation, specific to a situation or a need which can't be known by normal means.

Word of Wisdom - a supernatural impartation of the mind and will of Yahweh, concerning situations, people and places.  It concerns Yahweh's plans and purposes and is given where natural wisdom cannot answer the problem.  

Although these manifestations have been categorised for clarification in this manner, they are not compartmentalised.  Often they will be grouped together differently in their operation, according to the need.
For instance, a word of knowledge may be given of a physical ailment, which is the result of an oppressing spirit that needs a gift of healing.  Knowledge, Discernment and Healing gifts being operated together.  Many such combinations occur, as He, the Spirit of God wills to meet the needs of the Body of Y'shua and bring it to perfection and maturity in Him.

We are called to be servants of one another and good stewards of the grace of God which is given to us, keeping one another in high esteem, so that whatever we minister of His gifts, it will be with dignity and faithfulness to what we have been given.


&quot;And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. Pursue love, and desire spiritual manifestations/gifts  &quot;1 Corinthians 13:13-14:1

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE PRACTICE OF LAYING ON HANDS===
Laying on of Hands is a practice used as a means of contact to confer a blessing or impartation from one person to another. There is an identification with the object/person through the contact whereby the anointed hands become a channel through which something from the Ruach HaKodesh is transferred from  one to the other.

In Hebrew the main concept is that of responsibility and obligation.  
The Hebrew word used is SAMAK and means to lay the hand on so as to lean heavily.  It conveyed the idea of forcibly pressing down upon, so that the victim was viewed as a support. This conveyed the idea of the pressure or weight of responsibility which was to be borne by the victim as a result of the laying on of hands. Thus was placed upon the victim an obligation regarding the ministry involved.

In Greek, the word used is EPITITHEMI and it has the sense of putting or placing upon the object, so as to come in contact with it.  This conveys the idea of identification with the object, by means of contact.

The usage of the word 'hand' in Hebrew (yadh) is associated with strength, authority and power. Thus the term 'hand' is associated with power in the hand.  The laying on of hands therefore is seen as that which draws from a reservoir of great strength and authority. Hence the ministry of laying on of hands is that which draws from the reservoir of Elohim and is imparted to the recipient.

===SCRIPTURAL TERMINOLOGY OF THE USE OF HANDS===
1. A term denoting Consecration
Speaking of consecrating the Cohen,  &quot;you shall consecrate (lit. &quot;fill the hands&quot;)  of Aaron and his sons    Exodus 29:9
Consecrating the Cohen was filling the hands of the Cohen with sacrifices,  i.e. giving him authority to minister. See Exodus 32:29;  1 Chronicles 29: 5;  Leviticus 8:22

2. A term used for Provision
Opening of the hand is viewed as an act of supplying a need.   Psalm 104:28; 145:16

3. The lifting of the hand as in Making an Oath
&quot;For I  lift up my hand to heaven and say, I live forever&quot;   Deut.32:40
&quot;I did swear (lit. 'lift up the hand') to give it to Avraham&quot;  Exodus 6: 8

4. The putting forth of the hand for Healing
&quot;Y'shua put forth his hand, and touched him  ... ....  his leprosy was cleansed.&quot;   Matt.8: 3

5. The shaking of the hand as a threat of Warning
&quot;Behold I will shake My hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants..&quot;  Zech.2: 9
&quot;He shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Tzion.&quot;  Isaiah 10:32

6.The stretching forth of the hand in Judgment
&quot;I will stretch out My Hand upon Edom &quot;   Ezek.25:13
The Hand of Elohim being upon something or someone is often used in a punitive sense  (Deut.2:15), but sometimes used for deliverance  (Isaiah 41:20)

7. The Hand of Elohim resting upon someone in Anointing for the Prophetic ministry.
The root of the Hebrew word 'anointing' means 'to draw the hand over'
The term is also used when Elohim is working deeply in a person's life, His Hand is said to be upon them.The Hand of Elohim has the added meaning of bearing the person away in the Spirit. See 2 Kings 3:15,16;  Ezek.1:3; 37:1

8. The Hand of Elohim as Strength and Power in Deliverance
When Moses blessed Yhudah he prayed that Elohim would hear the 'voice' of Yhuda, and that his &quot;hands would be sufficient for him&quot;.  He links the idea of the voice lifted for help and guidance with the strength and power of the hands.

Yhudah would be active in warfare, spiritual and natural.  His name Yhudah is a transliteration of the Hebrew word 'yadah' and it is a derivative of the word 'yadh' for hand.  Thus the root idea behind his name is the strength and power of the hand.  It is through him that The Hand of Elohim would be manifest to bring deliverance, redemption and dominion in the earth.  Deut. 33:7

9.  The hand as a term in general for  Ministry
i.e.  &quot;the service (yadh - hand) of song&quot;   1 Chronicles 6:31
&quot;David praised by their ministry (lit. by their hand)   2 Chronicles 7:6
&quot;by the ministry (yadh - hand) of the prophets&quot;   Hosea 12:10

The right hand was always deemed to be the means of transferring the greater blessing, and the left, the lesser. The place of being at the right hand was conceived of being that of special honour. To sit at the right hand was to sit in a place of honour (1 Kings 2:19; Psalm 110:1; Ephesians 1:20-22). The right hand was also associated in Hebraic thinking with success, prosperity and righteousness  (Isaiah 41:10) The double portion blessing was seen as transferred by the laying of both hands on the recipient.

===FUNCTION OF LAYING ON OF HANDS===
There are five functions for this ministry.
1. Impartation
2. Identification
3. Confirmation
4. Ministration of Blessing
5. Commissioning for ministry

1. Impartation
In the laying on of hands there is an actual impartation from the administrator to the recipient. Elohim Himself is essentially Spirit  (John4:24).  Thus, when a Spirit-filled anointed servant lays hands on another, there is an impartation of Spiritual vitality, The Life Force of Elohim.

Natural man in himself cannot impart spiritual power, except through counterfeit demonic power from a Satanic origin by a person under the power of those influences. The counterfeit is always inferior in quality and power to the genuine. It is impossible to impart that which you do not personally possess and man does not have the power to transmit spiritual power. This dimension is not possible in the natural. So, a believer must be spirit-filled and must be anointed for the ministry involved.

It is a spiritual impartation which not only affects the spirit of man but both his soul and physical being as well.  A new dimension of super-natural spiritual impartation through empowerment by Elohim is given to the Spirit-filled believer when he lays hands on another. It can be used to transmit spiritual blessings, giftings, power or authority to the recipient.

2. Identification
In the laying on of hands there is also identification.  In the sacrificial system there was an identification of the offerer with the sacrificial victim by means of physical contact.  By the laying on of hands the offerer and the offering became one. The sacrificial animal thus bore the sin of the offerer. Leviticus 1: 4; 3: 2; 4:15, 24, 29, 33; 16:21-22; Numbers 8:12

There was also a practice of mediating between two people through laying hands on both parties.  The judge or adjudicator set a date for hearing the case and as a means of identifying with them, would lay hands on each as a sign of mediating between both and reconciling them.  The identification showed his intention to adjudicate between them and bring them into agreement.  Yob allures to this practice in Ch.9:33. (A 'daysman' is a judge).

In 1 Timothy 5:22 Shaul warns Timothy, the assembly overseer,  regarding laying hands on another hastily, and in verse 24 gives the reason in that some men's sins are openly known, and others are secret.  By laying on hands,  complete identification is made with the person and all that they are, therefore we become partakers of their sins. Hence the need for care.

3. Confirmation
In the laying on of hands there is also a confirmation of the candidate.  This can be of a positive or negative nature. In the old covenant penalties imposed for sin, hands would be laid on the accused by witnesses to his offense. By so doing they were making a formal confirmation of the guilt of the person.  Thus they confirmed that the accused was indeed guilty and worthy of the prescribed punishment.   This is according to Moses instruction  -	Deuteronomy 17:2-7

In the new covenant the confirming of believers took on a positive aspect.
Whenever Shaul went on his journeys visiting the established  assemblies, it was with the purpose of confirming them.

&quot;And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies.&quot;	Acts 15:41

Although it is not directly stated just what form this confirmation took, it appears as though it was confirming them in their respective giftings and ministries, thus edifying the body of believers.

&quot;And Yuda and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them&quot;  Acts 15:3
In this instance it is clear that their ministry of prophecy had a part in 'confirming' the disciples.

Also in Acts 14:22, 23  Shaul is going through the area &quot;confirming the souls of the disciples&quot; and part of that was ordaining elders in every assembly, which would have involved laying on of hands and prophecy.  e.g.  1 Timothy 4:14-15;  1:18; 2 Timothy 1: 6, 14

4. Ministration of Blessing
Laying hands on, or lifting the hands toward another was done in an intent of blessing the other person. The imposition of hands brings blessing from Elohim to the recipient of that ministry. 

This is a very ancient custom, as in Egyptian art,  mourners are depicted laying hands on their heads as did Tamar when in mourning (2 Sam.13:19).   The custom was that by laying hands on the head, the circumstances would change by the act of invoking blessing on oneself.

Yakkov blessed his sons with the prophetic word and in the case of Ephraim and Manasseh it says, &quot;he blessed them that day&quot;  (Genesis 48:13-20)
Aaron also used this lifting of the hands in the ministry of blessing Israel.   (Leviticus 9:22)

Y'shua also did this in departing from His disciples   (Luke 24:50-51)
Y'shua laid hands on the infants as requested, demonstrating that it was a practised custom.  Mark 10:13,16 Matt.19:13-15

5. Commissioning of Ministry
This was an established practice in the ordination of ministry and in the commissioning and sending forth of ministry. It was public acknowledgment that these men were ordained, commissioned and equipped for the task by the impartation of the necessary wisdom, grace and power that would be needed.

In,
1. The Choosing of Elders and  commissioning them to their ministry   Acts 6: 1-7
&quot;Whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them&quot;   verse 6

2. Ordination, as of Timothy.	1 Timothy 4:14; 2 Timothy 1: 6

3. Sending Forth of Ministry	Acts 13:3 &quot;When they had fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them, they sent them away&quot;

NOTE	-      Scientific Validation
Secular science has proven that hands impart a force or energy.  Medical science has further substantiated this fact.

Dr Delores Krieger, a professor of New York university, showed that the laying on of hands raised the hemoglobin levels in the blood samples of those tested.  Pretest samples were drawn from all those involved and it was found that the mean value of the samples differed significantly from their pretest value.  A control group was tested at the same times and showed significant difference.  1

This is significant in that the &quot;life is in the blood&quot;  (Leviticus 17:13-14), and that there was a rise in the level of 'life' in the blood.
Also a test was done by a Biochemist and enzymologist, M. Justa Smith who did extensive tests on the biochemical effects of energy imparted through the laying on of hands.  The tests showed that the energy force was raised at the enzymatic level similar to the effect produced by a high magnetic energy field.   2

&quot;As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of Elohim.&quot;  1 Peter 4:10

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE PURPOSE OF LAYING ON HANDS ===
The laying on of hands has many functions, not least important, that of ministering blessing, peace and comfort to others. It is a foundation stone of Yahweh's House in that many ministries are dependent upon it.
The following are some of the main usages of it  --

1.  To minister healing
2.  For the ministration of signs and wonders
3.  For the impartation of the Baptism of the Spirit
4.  To impart spiritual gifts

1. TO MINISTER HEALING
The practice of laying on hands was very prominent in the old covenant for healing and it's use was continued in the new order.
Naaman expected this in his healing from leprosy  2 Kings 5:11
Y'shua practiced it in His ministry - &quot;all they that had any sick with various diseases brought them unto Him; and He laid hands on every one of them, and healed them.&quot;  Luke 4:40            
Also in  Matthew 8:3; 9:18; 20:34  Mark 1:41; 5:23; 6: 5; 7:32; 8:23,24

He said that other believers would also do this.  &quot;They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover&quot;  Mark 16:18
The apostles and other disciples followed this example &quot;And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentry:  Paul went in unto him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.&quot;   Acts 28: 8

2. TO MINISTER SIGNS AND WONDERS
&quot;And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people&quot;  Acts 5:12

&quot;Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who was bearing witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.&quot;  Acts 14: 3

&quot;Now God  worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul&quot;  Acts 19:11

3. TO MINISTER THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
The baptism of the Holy Spirit operated through Baptism in water upon repentance, but on some occasions in the establishment of the early Assembly, it was imparted through the laying on of hands.

These occasions were  -
i. To Paul after his conversion on the Damascus road,  Ananias came and prayed for healing and for him to receive the Holy Spirit. Acts 9:17 

ii. Paul to Timothy  “Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.&quot; 2 Timothy 1:6

iii. To the Samaritans in Acts 8 who had already believed through Phillip's preaching and ministry of the gifts of the Spirit.  The eldership of the Jerusalem council came down to establish and authorise their entrance into the kingdom  (Acts 8:18)   -  Simon saw that through the laying on of hands the Holy Spirit was given.

iv. To the Ephesians who had already been baptised unto John's baptism, Paul therefore laid hands on them to complete their spiritual experience.  Acts 19:11

4. TO IMPART SPIRITUAL GIFTS
&quot;For I long to see you,  that I may impart some spiritual gift, so that you may be established&quot;  Romans 1:11
It was the established practice to &quot;impart spiritual gifts&quot; by the laying on of hands and the accompanying prophetic word.

Timothy is one example that is recorded who received his gifting by the laying on of hands and prophecy of the eldership, most probably that of Ephesus. &quot;stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands&quot;   2 Timothy 1: 6
This word 'through' or 'by' conveys the idea of being a channel in the Greek language.

In the Syriac Peshitta which antedates the oldest copies which we have of the new covenant scriptures, and which is the sister dialect of the Aramaic language spoken by the disciples, the particular preposition (through) was a compound form literally meaning &quot;with the hand of&quot;.  All through the Syriac Peshitta, this word is used in the idea of a channel of impartation.   (This was the version used by the early assemblies).  
This concept of the hand being a channel of impartation was so strong that it affected the language of that era.
  
The gifts were imparted together with the ministry of prophecy, as Paul refers to in  1 Timothy 4:14  &quot;by prophecy, with the laying on of hands&quot;   The word 'with' here is 'meta' in Greek and conveys the idea of association between prophecy and the laying on of hands. One was in conjunction with the other. Thus the gift was imparted through the both avenues of ministry.

===QUALIFICATIONS FOR IMPARTARTION OF GIFTS===
The ministration of laying on of hands is for every believer  -  &quot;These signs shall follow them that believe ..  .. they shall lay hands on the sick ..  &quot;  Mark 16:17-18

All believes are called to be priests and exercise their priestly ministry to Yahweh but there are requirements for them to be able to minister in the Spirit.  
They need to be   --

1.  Set Apart
Being a kingdom of priests in the new covenant, we exercise all the privileges of the priests of the old order.

In the Levitical system, the priests exercised this ministry in the sacrificial system firstly by being consecrated and then they operated in their ministry provided they were in a state of ceremonial cleanliness.  If they were defiled,  they were not to minister.  (Exodus 29:10; Leviticus 16:21; 1: 4; 3:2;  -   Numbers 19:20-22)

This same principle applies for us, we are to consecrated to His service, so that in our worship of Him and ministry to the people, we will be able to &quot;lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting&quot;   1 Timothy 2: 8
We are to be a holy priesthood, set apart for His service  -  1 Peter 2: 5, 9-12

&quot;But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honour and some for dishonour.  Therefore if anyone cleanse himself from the latter, he will be vessel for honour, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work.&quot;   2 Timothy 2:20-21

2.  Spirit-filled
Y'shua said, &quot;He who believes in Me, as the scripture has said, out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water. But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive,  .. .. &quot;   John 7:38,39

&quot;understand what the will of the Lord is.  .. ..  be filled with the Spirit&quot; Ephesians 5:18, 19

To impart from the Spirit, you must be abiding in the Vine so that the sap  of that vine is flowing through you.  If you,  as the branch are withered, the flow of the life is also dried up.  You need to be in right relationship and be full of the blessing of Yahweh,  to have an abundance to give out to others.  Your vessel needs to be kept full to overflowing, to allow the rivers of living water to flow through in ministration to others.   John 15: 1-8

3.   Filled with Faith in the Word
&quot;Let the word of Messiah dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in  psalm and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to Yahweh.   And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Y'shua, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.&quot;	Colossians 3:16-17

Our life needs to be centered in the Word, so that everything we do is Word-based and Word-filled.

If all of our thinking and motivation is based on the Word, we will be prepared for the situations that come and have the necessary faith to minister in His Name.

&quot;So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.&quot;  Romans 10:17

&quot;If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire and it will be done for you.  By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so will you be My disciples&quot; John 15: 7, 8

4. Be  Anointed
Anointing for a specific task depends on one's own anointing and spiritual status. The anointing on our lives can be increased by prayer, fasting and waiting upon Yahweh.

All believers may lay hands on one another and pray for various needs to be met, but there is always a greater deposit of the anointing in areas where one has personally overcome or been ministered to. Greater authority is exercised over the works of darkness through personal victory.   Y'shua is an example of this, He healed all who were oppressed by the devil (Acts 10:38). Our anointing may be limited in its effectiveness.

===FUNCTION OF THE ELDERSHIP===
Giftings for ministry within the Body are imparted by the anointed eldership of apostles and prophets. It is a transference of the anointing that rests on one to another, as with Paul to Timothy, according to the measure of growth of the developing ministry and at the direction of the Holy Spirit.  For instance, Paul exhorted Timothy to do the work of an evangelist, but he was in training by Yahweh to fill a pastoral role  (2 Timothy 4: 5).

See also Numbers 27:18-23 where Moses lays hands on Joshua for his ordination, and,
&quot;Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: &quot;  Deuteronomy  34: 9

The ministry of the presbytery via the laying on of hands and the prophetic word, establishes ministries in a local body in their area of function and gives the needed validation to those ministries, thus bringing order. It assists the individual members to know their place in the Body,  giving confirmation of their function and direction for further development,  as they heed the prophetic word given through the eldership.   

&quot;When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men,&quot; .. ..  for the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Messiah&quot;   Ephesians 4: 8, 12

When Y'shua triumphed over the enemy, He led his hosts captive and gained back from him the original divine mandate which was given to Adam of priestly dominion (Colossians 2:15).  The governmental positions which Satan usurped are now dispensed to His Body through the appointed offices of leadership which He has ordained as gifts for the edification and growth of His Body to it's full maturity wherein it can assume it's calling to rule and to reign with Him.   Revelation 5: 8-10

Therefore it is one of the foundation stones of the House of Yahweh after Baptisms,  in the ongoing process of establishing the believer in particular,  and the Body as a whole.

&quot;Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Y'shua the Messiah being the chief cornerstone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.&quot;  Ephesians 2:19-22

Thus this ministry of the laying on of hands is foundational in the growth of the Body, as it is through this ordinance that the ministries established by Messiah, that of the Apostle and Prophet in particular, impart the necessary grace for the edification of the rest of the Body to come to its fulfillment in Messiah.	Ephesians 4: 7-16



&quot;If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of Yahweh.  If anyone ministers, let him do it with the ability which Yahweh supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Y'shua the Messiah&quot;  1 Peter 4:11

      <text xml:space="preserve">===RESURRECTION===
Resurrection means a 'raising up', or 'rising up' from the Greek word ANASTASIS.  In the verb form it means 'to cause to stand or rise up; to raise from sleep or from the dead'. The word 'rapture' is a term not found in scripture and represents an erroneous doctrine.  Rapture comes from the word Raptus which is found in the Latin Vulgate and it is the Latin form of the Greek word Harpazo which means &quot;caught up&quot;  1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 is the doctrine of the Rapture

===THE BASIS OF SALVATION===
The resurrection of the dead is one of the most basic of doctrines; and we accept it as fact that Y'shua the Messiah  not only suffered and died for the sins of the world, but that He subsequently rose from the grave by the power of the Almighty God - His Father. 

&quot;Messiah died for our sins  ..  .. and that He was buried and rose again on the third day ..  ..  He was seen of Peter, then by the twelve. After that He was seen by over five hundred brethren at once,&quot;    1 Corinthians 15: 3-7

It is the foundation of our faith, for,  &quot;If Messiah is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty.  .. ..you are still in your sins!&quot;  (1  Corinthians 15:14 and 17b)  The basis of the 'good news' and our salvation rests in His resurrection. For the reality of the resurrection means that Y'shua Messiah not only rose from the dead, but that He is alive today.  

Y'shua's resurrection is also Yahweh's infallible guarantee that all who genuinely believe in His Son will likewise rise from their graves and live forever, even though the sleep of temporal death may overtake them. 

This is the 'gospel' - the good news of salvation, not only salvation from the power of sin, but also from all its consequences, the ultimate outworking being death not only in its spiritual form, but also from the ultimate state of physical death.

===RESURRECTION FROM DEATH===
Death is not a state of non-existence, nor is it annihilation, but in its scriptural sense it is a separation from the Source of life.  Our present existence is actually a state of death.  See Luke 16:19-31;  Isaiah 14:9-11;  1 Peter 3:18-20
Death affects man in three levels.	
1. Spiritually
2. Physically
3. Eternally - 'to the ages of the ages'


1.  Spiritual Death
This is the separation of the soul of man from God through sin.  Adam as a living soul died spiritually in the literal day that he sinned.  He became severed from the life that is in Yahweh God.   &quot;the soul who sins will die&quot;  (Ezekiel 18:20)

&quot;The wages of sin is death&quot;  (Romans 6:23)  -  death (separation from the true and living God) is the repayment you receive from being your own 'god'.

&quot;To be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace&quot;  (Romans 8: 6).  'Carnal' as used here is 'fleshly'  -   i.e. thinking according to the flesh, or allowing the flesh to dominate your life.  That brings death (James 1:12-15). So although physically alive, you can be spiritually 'dead'.   1 Timothy 5: 6;  Revelation 3: 1

2.  Physical Death
Physical death is the separation of the soul and spirit from the body.  Man was not meant to die, Adam died physically 930 years after he sinned, which was in the typical 'day' that Yahweh predicted (2 Peter 3:8).  See Romans 5:12,14,21 and Hebrews 9:27

Our bodies were formed to regenerate - the cells renew themselves and medical science cannot determine why man dies.  It is the principle of sin outworking in our bodies, in death as a process - &quot;dying you shall die&quot;.  Weakness, sickness and disease.

3.  Eternal Death
This is the judgment determined on all those who reject the atonement for sin purchased by the Saviour.  It is called in scripture, the 'second death' which is effected through the 'lake of fire'.  Revelation 20:11-15
Of this all the prophets warned &quot;to flee from the wrath to come&quot;  where He will &quot;burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire&quot;  (Matthew 3: 7, 12) This is the 'worm' that never dies and the fire that is not quenched  -  Isaiah 66:24;  Mark 9:43-48

Those who overcome the 'flesh' are assured that they will not be hurt by the 'second death'.  Revelation 2:11; 20:6

But, “…the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.&quot;  Revelation 21:8

Y'shua, the second man, the substitute Adam tasted death in every form for man.  As the 'last Adam', He overcame death on our behalf.  He tasted death spiritually in His separation from the Father, physically by being put to death in the flesh, and when He went into Sheol/Hades, He experienced eternal death on our behalf.  (Hebrews 2:9;  1 Corinthians 15:45-47)

Because of His sinlessness, death could not hold him in its clutches, when the sentence was completed that He took on our behalf, the Spirit of Yahweh raised Him from the grave triumphant over all the powers of darkness that had sought to hold Him in their grip. Read Psalm 22: 6-8,14-18 of the Saviour's suffering.

He arose!	
									
He arose the victor, triumphant over death and now as a life-giving Spirit He imparts His victorious life to us. 

===THE PROCESS OF RESURRECTION===
Through Messiah, man is made alive, 'raised up' to spiritual life and immortality through the gospel (2 Timothy 1:9-10).
He died to redeem us spiritually, physically and eternally and to deliver us from he who has the power of death, that is, Satan.
&quot;That through death (Messiah's), He might destroy him that has the power of death, that is, the devil&quot;   Hebrews 2:14,15

1. Spiritual Resurrection
From being in a state of death, man is 'raised up' to live in the spiritual realms by the Ruach HaKodesh.  This is the process of being 'born again' or 'born from above' -  spiritually regenerated (John 3: 3-5).    This is a resurrection.

From being dead in trespasses and sins, man is made alive together with Messiah, and He has  &quot;raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places (spiritual realms)  in Messiah Y'shua&quot;   (Ephesians 2: 1,5-6  &amp;  Colossians 2:12-13)

&quot;For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death,  certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection.&quot;  Romans 6: 5

&quot;But if the Spirit who raised up Messiah from the dead dwell in you, He who raised up Messiah from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.&quot;	Romans 8:11
Health and healing are also the outworking of His Spirit in us.  See also 2 Corinthians 4:10,11

Man is a tri-partite being, spirit soul and body (1 Thessalonians 5:23).  There is a process of resurrection that needs to take place in our souls, as well as our spirit and then finally with our bodies.
The redemptive work for our soul was completed at Calvary, but we need to appropriate that work into our life. 

We have been chosen to salvation through sanctification (holiness) by the Spirit and belief in the truth.  (2 Thessalonians 2:13)

We are to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling  (Philippians 2:12), &quot;Receiving (ensuring) the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.&quot;  1 Peter 1: 9

As Paul prayed, that &quot;Your whole spirit, soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Y'shua the Messiah&quot;  1 Thessalonians 5:23

2.  Physical Resurrection
The promise of the resurrection of our physical bodies is the glorious hope of the gospel.

The scriptures declare that the resurrection of the believers body will be like unto Messiah's glorious body after His resurrection,   --- 
&quot;Who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all things unto Himself.&quot; Philippians 3:21

&quot;we shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.  For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass that saying that is written, 'Death is swallowed up in victory'&quot;  1 Cor.15:52-4

Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom, we must be changed.  We shall no longer have flesh and blood bodies,  but as His was when He arose, a flesh and bone body. 	1 Corinthians 15:47-49 &amp; Luke 24:39

In that flesh and bone body, Y'shua ate and drank and conducted himself in life for those 40 days, but was obviously not bound by the laws of the physical realm.  He was a spirit-man in a 'glorious body' incorruptible physical body.

&quot;As we have borne the image of the earthy, so we shall also bear the image of the heavenly (or spiritual) &quot;  1 Corinthians 15:49

This was the same hope of the Old covenant saints  -

&quot;Your dead shall live; together with my dead body they shall arise.&quot;	Isaiah 26:19

&quot;In my flesh I shall see God&quot;  Job  19:26

&quot;I will ransom them from the power of the grave. I will redeem them from death.&quot;  Hosea 13:14

&quot;I will see Your face in righteousness, I shall be satisfied when I awake in your likeness&quot;  Psalm 17:15  (David)

===TWO RESURRECTIONS===
&quot;There will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust&quot;  Acts 24:15

&quot;The hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.&quot;  John 5:28,29

'''First Resurrection'''
This is a resurrection to life in the flesh for all those who have died in Messiah and have no need of judgment in their lives.
They will live with Him during the Messianic age on earth as a firstfruits of His creation that come to perfection.

&quot;we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly awaiting the adoption, the redemption of our body.  For we were saved in this hope  ..  ..  ..&quot;
&quot;Likewise the Spirit helps us in our infirmities ..  ..  .. because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of Yahweh. .. ..  &quot;For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren.&quot;	Romans 8:23,26a,27b,29

The redemption of our bodies is dependent upon us being conformed to His image by the working of His Spirit in our lives. From the initial deposit of the Spirit in our lives (the 'firsfruits') to the outworking of His image in us, we are called to be holy. The operation of His Spirit is to produce a Bride without spot or wrinkle.  Ephesians 5:25

This is what He is coming for!
&quot;Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.&quot;   Revelation 20: 6; 19:7-9

'''Second Resurrection'''
This is a resurrection to judgment. Sometimes called the Great White Throne judgment. The books are opened and all who are raised in this resurrection are judged according to their works.   Revelation 20:12,13

The book of Life is also opened and whoever is not found written in this book is cast into the Lake of Fire.  Revelation 20:15
Death and the place of the dead, Sheol/Hades are cast into the Lake of Fire. Death is abolished and the grave emptied.

Y'shua gave many parables regarding unfaithfulness and its rewards.  
Faithful and wise stewards of our Masters goods will receive dominion to rule and reign with Him (i.e. the first resurrection), but the unwise shall receive their portion with the unbelievers, which means they will be raised in the second resurrection to judgment.   Luke 12:35-50

&quot;The Lord knows how to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment.&quot;   2 Peter 2: 9 

The unprofitable servant who knew His master's will and didn't do it, is cast into outer darkness where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.  Matthew 25:30;  8:11,12

&quot;Therefore, brethren, be even more diligent to make your call and election sure, for if you do these things you will never stumble; for so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our King and Savior Messiah Y'shua.&quot;   2 Peter 1:2-11

SUMMARY
1. Y'shua was raised to life by the power of Yahweh God. (Acts 4:10, Romans 6:4)

2. He was subsequently seen by over 500 witnesses. (Acts 2:32, 1 Corinthains 15:6)

3. The Bible clearly teaches the resurrection of the dead as a foundational teaching . (1 Corinthians 15:20-23)

4. There are two general resurrections:
The first, the Resurrection to Life, will take place at the return of Messiah. (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17, John 5:29)

The second, the Resurrection to Judgment, will occur a thousand years after the first resurrection. (Revelation 20: 5-6) 

5. Resurrected believers who rise at the first resurrection will come forth with glorified and immortal bodies, similar to the body Y'shua possessed when He rose from the grave. (1 Corinthians 15:42-44, 1 John 3:2)

6. They will then receive their awards and eternal inheritance. (Luke 14:14; Matthew 16:27)

7. The unbeliever and the unfaithful will rise in the Resurrection of Judgement at the end of the millennium. (Rev. 20:12-14)

8. All those who seek to live forever  should accept and act upon the words of the Saviour who said: &quot;I am the resurrection, and the life: He that believes in me, though he may die, yet shall he live.&quot;    John 11:25


&quot;Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless;&quot;      	2 Peter 3:14

      <text xml:space="preserve">===ORDER OF THE RESURRECTION===
At the second advent of Messiah, those who have died in Messiah, the saints of all ages, will be raised to life and then those who are alive will be changed from their state of mortality to immortality to join those who have been raised from the dead. This resurrection will be a raising of the physical body to be immortal and incorruptible.

&quot;But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep,  ..  .. For if we believe that Y'shua died and rose again, even so Yahweh will bring with Him those who sleep in Y'shua. For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep.   For the Lord will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God .  And the dead in Messiah shall be raised first.&quot;   1 Thessalonians 4:13-16

Those who have fallen asleep in Messiah, the saints of past ages and those in this age, will be raised first.
Note. They looked forward in faith to Messiah's coming, we look back to His appearance in the flesh.

&quot;Behold I tell you a mystery:  we shall not  all sleep, but we shall all be changed - in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.  For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,   &quot;   1 Corinthians 15:51-53 

&quot;Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord&quot;	1 Thessalonians 4:17

&quot;.. ..  we also eagerly await the Savior, the Lord, Y'shua the Messiah, who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working whereby He is able to subdue all things to Himself.&quot;  Phil.3:20b-21

We who are alive and remain until the time of His coming will be caught up in the air with the returning saints and be changed from mortality to immortality, from corruptible flesh to incorruptible one which will be like Y'shua's resurrection body.  

===THE TRUMPET CALL===
'''The timing'''
&quot;Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.  And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.&quot;   Matthew 24:30-31

Yahweh will sound the trumpet to gather His elect.  See also 1 Corinthians 15:51 &quot;at the last trumpet&quot;, and 1 Thessalonians 4:16 &quot;with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God&quot;

This is the trumpet call for the saints of the first resurrection, and take note, by Y'shua's words it is &quot;after the tribulation of those days&quot;  in verse 29 of Matthew 24.  The sun being darkened and the moon not giving its light and the powers of heaven being shaken all precede His coming.
&quot;For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be.  And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved;  But for the elect's sake those days will be shortened.&quot; Matthew 24:21,22

'''The Season of His Return'''
Y'shua said that no man would know the day or the hour of His return, (Matthew 24:36;  25:13)  but it would appear that we can know the season of His return as is illustrated by the parable of the fig tree.  (Matthew 24:32-35;  Luke 21:29-31)

&quot;But take heed to yourselves. lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness and the cares of this life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.  For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape (Lit. 'flee out') all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.&quot;  Luke 21:34-36

&quot;Now brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Y'shua the Messiah and our gathering together to Him, ..  ..  that day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition,  ..  2 Thessalonians 2: 1-3

Y'shua warns of falling away, of being caught up in the lifestyle of the world (See also Matthew  24:37-39), as does Paul.
After the falling away begins, then the man of sin, the AntiChrist/AntiMessiah will be revealed.  Paul is correcting false ideas in Thessalonica that the resurrection may have been past (2:2), and showing them that it could not be so, for although there had been many of that type of spirit, the 'lawless one' (the AntiChrist/Messiah) had not arrived on the scene.  Furthermore, Paul says in 2 Thessalonians 2:8 that he would be destroyed at Messiah's coming.  This gives assurance for all time that there will be no secret coming (see also Matthew 24:26,27)  as the Rapture doctrine teaches.

It also is a time indicator, as the prophetic time spans in Revelation of 1,260 days indicate the length of AntiMessiah's rule. But we have another clear indicator.  Y'shua's return will be at the last trumpet.

Each prophetic event so far has sequenced with the feast of its kind.   Messiah's sacrifice was on Passover, the giving of the Spirit on Shavuot/Pentecost, perfectly fulfilling the type.His second coming will also fulfill the type of the feast of Trumpets, in the last segment of Feasts of the prophetic year.

So, we know the season of the year, and, we are told,
&quot;But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you  ..&quot;
But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.  You are all sons of light and sons of the day.  We are not of the night, nor of darkness&quot;   1 Thessalonians 5: 1,4,5

This Day will overtake the world and those of the kingdom who are not walking in the light  (see verses 6-10) as a thief in the night, but those of us who are of the 'day' will understand the times and the seasons, and the scriptural interpretation of them. We will see clearly.

===THE FINAL ACT OF REDEMPTION===
Resurrection of the body is the final stage of our redemption.  Romans 8:23
The first two stages of redemption need to be complete for the redemption of the body to be effected. That is, the redemption of the spirit in conversion is the first step. But also then, the second part of our 'salvation'  is in the renewing of the soul, our mind/personality (Romans 12:1-2; Colossians 3: 1-10). We are predestined to be conformed to His image (Romans 8:29).

We have the Spirit as a guarantee (a deposit, a down payment) of our coming inheritance, but the progressive installments must be made on any goods purchased with a down payment, to be able to take final possession of the article. Those progressive payments are made as we allow the Spirit to work out His purposes in our lives to appropriate what was purchased for us at Calvary.  We need to become filled with all the fullness of Yahweh.   2 Corinthians 5:1-11;  Ephesians 3:19-21

&quot;Be diligent that you may be found in Him in peace (not with rebuke), without spot and blameless&quot;   2 Peter 3:14

&quot;Even as the testimony of Messiah was confirmed in you, so that you come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord, Y'shua the Messiah, who will confirm you to the end that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Y'shua the Messiah.&quot;   1 Corinthians 1: 6-8

Our perfection/holiness and coming to full stature as a son of the Almighty is what He died for!   (Eph.4: 7,12-13; Heb. 2:10)

&quot;Messiah loved the Church/Assembly and gave Himself for her, that he might sanctify and cleanse her .. that He might present her to Himself a glorious church/assembly, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.&quot;   Ephesians 5:25b-27

He is coming for a pure and spotless Bride!

&quot;not having spot or wrinkle&quot;
The 'spots' are the stains of sin on our garments which have not been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, and the 'wrinkles' are the evidences of the old nature creasing our garments, the imperfections and limitations of the fallen human nature.

Messiah's life needs to be completely worked out in us so that our righteousness is 'bright and clean'. The parable of the ten virgins tells the story of those who were not ready. No time to prepare when you realise that His return is imminent and that you lack the measure of the anointing to bring you to His perfection. Matthew 25:1-13

===THE ELECT COMPANY===
John was given the vision of the elect company of the last days and it includes two groups:

1.  Overcomers -  Israelites, the select 144,000   Revelation 7: 1- 8
2.  Great Multitude -
::all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues,  out of great tribulation  Revelation 7: 9-17
::priests of God to rule and reign with Him 1,000 years   Revelation 20: 4-6

'''The Overcomers'''
This group is pictured in Revelation 7 and again in Revelation 14.
They were sealed with the seal of Yahweh in Chapter 7 for protection from the judgments to come on the earth. These are those who have come into their full inheritance to rule with Messiah in His governmental system.  They have followed the Lamb completely, not being defiled with false religious systems ('women'), and are without fault before the throne of God. They are His firstfruits company who are worthy to have their Father's name written in their forehead, having taken on their full Israelite identity and function as a kingdom of priests.  Revelation 14:1-5

'''The Bride'''
The 'Bride' includes all those from ages past until the present who have walked 'in white' with Him and became worthy to be called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

&quot;Let us be glad and rejoice, and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb.&quot; Revelation 19:7-9

'Blessed and holy is he who has a part in the First Resurrection&quot;  -  Revelation 20:4-5 

===ATTAINING A BETTER RESURRECTION===
Paul spoke of a   &quot;better resurrection&quot; in Hebrews 11:35 
'Better' is from the Greek word KREISSN  1 - stronger or more powerful.  Vine's Expository Dictionary says that in this instance it gives the sense of more useful or more excellent.  A stronger, more powerful, more excellent resurrection.

Paul speaking of his own aspirations says, &quot;That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection,  and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,  if by any means, I may attain to the resurrection of the dead.&quot;   Philippians 3:10-11

Was Paul doubting his spiritual standing?   or was there some other meaning to what he was saying?

The literal translation of the last phase is  &quot;if somehow I may attain to the resurrection out of the dead.&quot;

Next he goes on to say, &quot;Not that I already received, or already been perfected&quot; (Interlinear Literal Translation v.12)

So this is a question of having received a status of perfection to qualify for this superior quality resurrection.  For which he says, &quot;I press toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Y'shua the Messiah.&quot;  (Ch.3:14)

Paul outlines this standard of perfection in Ephesians 4:13   &quot;to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Messiah;&quot;

The letters to the assemblies of Colossae, Ephesus and Phillipi were written from Rome during his term of imprisonment.  Paul is coming to the end of his spiritual journey.  He obviously realises that he is not going to be alive for His return, which the early church thought would be imminent, and he is aspiring to a superior resurrection, to be one of those who were walking by the Spirit, crucifying the flesh and 'striving'  to attain the perfection that is in Y'shua.   Philippians 3:15-21;  Galatians 2:20

Paul had his sight set on attaining the first resurrection from out of the state of death which was for those first attaining the sonship for which Messiah died, the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

Our Father subjected the whole creation to futility in the hope of receiving His inheritance in His sons, and the whole creation groans and travails awaiting its deliverance from the corruption resulting from the fall, in order to come into this coming glorious liberty (or liberation) of the sons of God.  The creation itself is groaning for the realisation of this,  and all of Yahweh's future plans await the manifestation of our sonship in the earth.   Romans 8:20-21

So be encouraged to press toward the mark for the high calling of Yahweh in Y'shua the Messiah.

&quot;The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.&quot;  Romans 8:18 

&quot;Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of our Lord.  See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and the latter rain. You also be patient.  Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.&quot;   James 5: 7-8

&quot;Beloved, now are we the children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.  And everyone who has this hope purifies himself, just as He is pure.&quot;	1 John 3:2-3


&quot;He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be His God and He shall be My son.&quot;     Revelation  21: 7

      <text xml:space="preserve">===A RESURRECTION TO PHYSICAL LIFE===
Resurrection is a bringing to life of the physical body out of the state of death, reconstituting the original physical form.

Yeshua said: &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the DEAD shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. . . Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life.  And they that have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment&quot; 	John 5:25-29.

This resurrection will include all from Adam until that time, the innumerable billions who have lived and died on this earth, who did not qualify to be in the First Resurrection and to be part of the &quot;firstfruits&quot; company of Yahweh's Bride. They will be raised to physical human life to be judged for the things done in the body.

&quot;It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment&quot;	Hebrews 9:27

===RESURRECTION TO LIFE TO ENACT JUDGMENT===
This resurrection is a resurrection to judgment of good and evil actions,  and those who have done 'evil' will be judged.  There is no categorising of the type of evil or of the degree, it includes all those who are not completely holy. That is, all that is not up to the standard of Yahweh's holiness. 'Evil' is the outworking of the sinful nature whose motivation is from self, and not necessarily that which is apparently evil to man. That which can appear good and righteous in the sight of man, is as filthy rags in the sight of Almighty God if it originates out of the self nature for it's own sense of self-worth.
&quot;There is a way which seems right to a man, but it's end is the way of death.&quot;  Proverbs 14:12

The second resurrection is a resurrection to JUDGMENT!
Those coming up in this resurrection will be judged  &quot;according to their works&quot;!     
 
John writes of this resurrection: &quot;And I saw the dead [all who ever lived], small and great, stand before God; and the BOOKS were opened [containing the record of their deeds and misdeeds, both good and bad]: and another book was opened, which is the BOOK OF LIFE: and the dead were JUDGED out of those things written in the books, according to their WORKS&quot; 	Revelation  20:12

The word for judgment here (kriseõs) (rendered 'damnation' in the KJV) but it has the meaning of making a selection, to determine, to form an opinion and to undergo a process of trial (Vine's Expository Dictionary). The sense is that of correction stemming from opinions or decisions given, concerning the relevant actions.  In other words, this judgment is a critique of things done, which then brings down a sentence.  
 
The sentence or judgment will be according to the acts of the person and will not necessarily result in complete condemnation for every person,  but there will be those who warrant the judgment of 'hell fire'. It will be a process of judgment that will decide each person's eternal destiny.

===THOSE INCLUDED IN THIS RESURRECTION===
Those in this general resurrection will include many categories of people.

1. All unsaved people who never had the opportunity for salvation -- those who grew up, lived and died in a society which didn't have the knowledge of Yahweh, or His truth. Those who lived and died in ignorance, some in total darkness who never even heard the true Gospel of the Messiah during their lives! At that future time they will be &quot;judged&quot; according to their works.    Romans 2:12-13

2. Many who have come to faith, but have either been under the old covenant, or else had not understood the new covenant, and did not enter into a spiritual 'born again' experience, they will be raised at this time. 

3. Those who came to faith in  Messiah,  but who have areas in their lives that will incur judgment and/or were not diligent in serving Him , will in fact be consigned to the second resurrection .  1 Peter 4: 3-5;  Matthew 25:30

4. This will also include those who were deceived by false religions that blinded them to the truth.

5. Many of the 'sons of the kingdom' of the House of Judah incurred the punishment inflicted because of their rejection of Messiah. They were the sons of the kingdom who were thrown into outer darkness (Matthew 8:12), and consigned to the second resurrection instead of partaking of the divine nature and being part of the kingdom of priests as intended for the first resurrection (2 Peter 1: 4). They were called to the kingdom but forfeited their call.  (Matthew 22:13-14)

6. All hypocrites, those who knew to do good and did not do it but lived in a sinful manner, Y'shua calls &quot;an evil 	servant&quot;, will be raised for judgement (Matthew 24:45-51).  Also those who did not obey His Word - Matthew 7:19-27

7. The  'wicked', those entrenched in evil, will be judged at this time,  including all those who opposed or completely rejected Yahweh and His Messiah in their lifetimes.    

There will be many excluded from the first resurrection  who refused to walk the 'narrow way'.   Luke 13:23-30

If we would judge ourselves, we will not be judged, Yahweh subjects us to chastening to save us from being condemned with the world.  1 Corinthians 11:31-32   1 Peter 4:17 

The lawless and disobedient will have their portion with the hypocrites and the unbelievers.   Matthew 7:21-23

===THE MILLENIUM===
The Eternal Word of Yahweh God will take up His authority to execute judgment and establish the kingdom on earth.  
&quot;And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron&quot;;   &quot;And with Him the armies of heaven, clothed in fine linen (righteous saints), white and clean, followed Him on white horses.&quot;    -  Revelation 19: 8;  19:14, 15;  Isaiah 11: 4;  66:16

He will take His divine authority as King of Kings and He shall reign together with His saints who are raised in the first resurrection, and they will rule with Messiah for one thousand years. 

Authority to execute judgment will be given to them to institute His divine government over the earth according to the measure of authority they each have been given, and they shall rule the nations with a 'rod of iron' to bring them under subjection to His principles, statutes and laws.   Revelation 20:4;  2:26, 27

They will be empowered with the authority of His Word.

&quot;Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?
Do you not know that we shall judge angels?&quot;    1 Corinthians 6: 2, 3

As well as executing authority over His kingdom, they shall be officiating  &quot;priests of God and of Messiah&quot; on behalf of the people,  according to His eternal purpose to have a &quot;kingdom of priests&quot;,  or  &quot;kings and priests&quot;.  Revelation 20: 6;  1: 6;  5:10,   also Exodus 19: 6  &amp;  Isaiah 32:1

&quot;Who is that faithful and wise servant, whom his master will make ruler over his household, to give them their food in due season?  Assuredly, I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all his goods.&quot;  Matthew 24:45, 47

There is a role in this oversight in the kingdom to teach knowledge and instruct in the ways of Yahweh, to give them their appropriate 'food',   i.e. to speak a word in season -   to exhort, encourage and edify the 'nations' that they might learn to walk in the ways of the Lord..

Satan will be bound during this time period and mankind will be free of his influence on the earth, and yet there will still be those who do not repent from their sin, and who will after the allotted time, be accursed.  Revelation 20: 1-3;  Isaiah 65:20

Just as there will still be those who will rebel against Yahweh, even after they have seen demonstrated the true knowledge of Him in the earth,  have experienced His goodness and benefited from His righteous government.
The earth will become filled with the knowledge of Yahweh and the earth will experience its Sabbath rest.

&quot;And it shall come to pass that from one New Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to worship before Me, saith Yahweh.&quot;  Isaiah 66:23

===ISRAEL HIS SEAT OF GOVERNMENT===
There will be a restoration of the whole House of Israel back to the land in a miraculous exodus, although only a remnant of all those born as Israelites will be saved  (Romans 9:27; Jeremiah 31:7-8 ),  and together both Houses (born again 'Jews' and enlightened Ephraimites - Judah and Ephraim), will defeat their enemies and they will possess their possessions, their eternal inheritance in the land.   Isaiah 11:10-16 &amp; 12:1-6;  Jeremiah 16:14;  Obadiah 17-18

This will be the time of the fulfillment of His promises to the patriarchs and the past men of faith, who looked for that city whose builder and maker was Yahweh. From righteous Abel, Enoch, Noah and Abraham to whom the everlasting covenant promise was made, (which promise we have entered into)  who lived as pilgrims in this world awaiting that which was to come  (Hebrews 11:10, 13-16).   Note  -  Not all of Israel entered into this covenant.

Abraham was also promised, all the land as far as his eye could see, (as well as being in the New Jerusalem) which he also did not receive in his lifetime even though it was established by an unconditional covenant.   Genesis 13:14; 15:7-21; 17:8

Isaac and Jacob and many others were inheritors of these same promises, as well as those who qualify from this age. To this end Paul preached, 
&quot;warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Messiah Y'shua&quot;   Colossians 1:28

&quot;That your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent, that [i.e. in order that] you may be sincere and without offence till the day of Messiah,  .. ..  being filled with all the fruits of righteousness which are by Y'shua the Messiah.&quot;    Philippians 1: 9-11

We who are Abraham's seed are the Israel of Yahweh God.   The new covenant was made to the Israel of God (Hebrews 8: 8, 10), and there are no racial or in-house distinctions.  See Colossians 3:10-11; Galatians 3:26-29;  Ephesians 2:12

He will establish His everlasting covenant with His people on the earth,  with David as their king, as a prince, ruling from Jerusalem,  and His tabernacle will be with them.   2 Samuel 23:5 &amp; Ezekiel 37:21-28
From Chapter 40 through to 48, Ezekiel gives all the specifications for the establishment of the temple and the divisions of the land,  and all that is to be set in order for the millennial reign of Messiah through His saints.

The time will have come that the saints possess the kingdom.   Daniel 7:22
&quot;Then the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the saints of the Most High.  His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him.&quot;   Daniel 7:27

This has been the expectation of Israel for the kingdom to come on earth, as Y'shua taught us to pray.  
 
&quot;Thy kingdom come, Your will be done upon earth as it is in heaven .. ..&quot;   Luke 11: 1-4

&quot;Will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&quot;    -   was the expectation of the disciples at that time.  (Acts 1:6)
Y'shua said to the twelve disciples that they would sit on thrones, when He took up the throne of His glory, and they would judge the twelve tribes of Israel.  Matthew 19:28 &amp; Luke 22:30;   Psalm 122: 5

&quot;In mercy the throne will be established, and One will sit on it in truth, in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking justice and hastening righteousness.&quot;  Isaiah 16: 5

The kingdom of His House shall be established and the law will go forth from Zion and establish justice and peace on the earth. When His judgments are in the earth. the people will learn righteousness. Isaiah 2: 1-4; 26: 9

All these things which are prophesied in the scriptures are to be fulfilled before Y'shua the Messiah returns to dwell with His people &quot;whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.&quot;   Acts 3:21
It is not until the New Jerusalem descends to earth that He comes to dwell with His people.  Revelation 21: 3, 22-23;  22: 3-4

===THE SECOND RESURRECTION===
&quot;But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished&quot;   Revelation 20: 5
Upon this scene of the established kingdom on earth, the dead of all ages are raised to life.

&quot;Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.   And there was found no more place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and the books were opened.   
And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.   And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.&quot;  Revelation 20:11-12

There are several books of records as well as the Book of life that will be opened. Daniel said,  
&quot;I watched till thrones were put in place, and the Ancient of days was seated; ...
&quot;The court was seated, and the books were opened.&quot;  Daniel 7: 9-10

Y'shua said, &quot;There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed,  and hidden that shall not be known.&quot;  Matthew 10:26 

and,  &quot;For every idle (unprofitable) word men shall speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment. For by your words you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned.&quot;   Matthew 12:36-37

Even the counsels of the heart will be manifest  (1 Corinthians 4:5;  Romans 2:16), for it has all been recorded. The only things not recorded are those things which have been sincerely repented of and washed clean by the blood of the Lamb.   1 John 1: 8-10

This judgment takes place at the end of the present &quot;heaven and earth&quot;.   The present creation flees away from before Him and there is no longer any place for it.   Revelation 20:11

After the judgment is completed,  John is shown &quot;a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away&quot;      Revelation 21: 1

Peter  says, &quot;The Day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat, both the earth and the works in it shall be burnt up.&quot;  2 Peter 3:10

And the writer of Hebrews, &quot;Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also heaven.  Now this, &quot;Yet once more,&quot; indicates the removal of those things that are being shaken, as of things that are made, that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.&quot;   Hebrews 12:26b-27;  Haggai 2: 6

Those not found written in the Book of Life are cast into the lake of fire. Y'shua warned that both soul and body could be destroyed in hell.    (Greek here is 'gehenna', i.e. 'hell-fire' - not 'hades' i.e. 'the grave')   Luke 12: 5;  Revelation 20:14 

Death and the grave will also cease to exist. 
&quot;Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire.   This is the second death.&quot;   Revelation  20:14

That blessed day will have arrived when &quot;Death is swallowed up in victory&quot;   1 Corinthians 15:54

With death being abolished, the restoration of all things has been completed,  and the Son, having completed His work, restores the kingdom to the Father, that He, Yahweh God, may be &quot;all in all&quot;. 
&quot;Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet.  The last enemy that will be destroyed is death..&quot;
&quot;Now when all things are made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to Him who put all things under Him, that Yahweh may be all in all.&quot;    1 Corinthians 15:24-26, 28

Of that state of existence we only get small glimpses, of glory unimaginable to our natural minds for which every hardship, trial, suffering or sacrifice rendered in this life will be nothing compared to that sublime glory which will be revealed.

&quot;But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.&quot;   1 Corinthians 2: 9  (quote from Isaiah 64:4)

&quot;Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people.  God Himself will be with them and be their God.  And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying.  There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. Then He who sat on the throne said, Behold I make all thing new.&quot;    Revelation 21: 3-5


&quot;Therefore, seeing all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the day of God&quot;    2  Peter 3:11

      <text xml:space="preserve">===ETERNAL JUDGMENT===
The word &quot;judge&quot; - KRINOS means &quot;to separate, to make a distinction between, to exercise judgement upon, to estimate, to assume a censorial power over, to call to account, to judge judiciously, to bring to trial, to be brought to account, to administer government over&quot;

===THE REASON FOR JUDGMENT===
1.   Because of sin against His laws.   &quot;As many as have sinned [missed the mark] in the law, shall be judged by the law&quot;  (Romans 2:12)     &quot;The soul that sins shall die&quot;  (Ezekiel  18: 4;   also Romans 3:23)

2. Because of disobedience  -  in that Yahweh is righteous and cannot overlook sin,  the penalty for the broken law has to be met.  Those who do not know Yahweh as well as those who do not obey the gospel incur His wrath. There are the two categories cited in 2 Thessalonians 1: 8;  Romans 2: 8, 9

3. Because ungodliness and unrighteousness is unacceptable to His holiness,  and sinners cannot come into His presence.   Hebrews 7:26;  1 Peter 1:15,16;  1 Timothy 6:13-16;  Revelation 15:4
      
4. His justice demands retribution upon those who have violated His commands, and exclusion from His presence and His future kingdom.   2 Thessalonians 1: 9;  Revelation 21:27, 8

5. To limit the effects of individual and collective sin so that man may come to repentance and be saved from eternal destruction. When His judgments are embraced they work salvation Psalm 94:12-13;  2 Peter 3: 9

Y'shua the appointed judge had many things to say of the judgment to come. He gave many warnings and told many parables to the His people,  of the righteous judgment to come,  against all sin and disobedience.
He spoke often of &quot;gehenna&quot; often translated as 'hell' or 'hell-fire' and the torment, anguish and punishment which would be inflicted there.   He always categorised this punishment as &quot;eternal' or &quot;everlasting&quot; as it is often translated in our English versions. These two words come from the Greek words AONIAN and AIDIOS which mean 'to the age' and 'age-lasting'.  
The same term is used for the recipients of &quot;eternal&quot; &amp; &quot;everlasting life&quot;.  
  
'Eternal' life and 'eternal' punishment would have to be equated as the same length of time, or else of the same nature, being spoken of in the same way -  i.e. that which is enduring.

Eternal judgment awaits every human soul. Y'shua our Messiah will return, the dead will be raised and they will be judged by Him and receive their eternal destiny. This will be a visible public and universal judgment.   The Lamb's victory over sin, death and Satan will be fully manifested and executed.

===IDENTITY OF THE JUDGE===
The Father is the instigator of the judgment to bring to completion His plan for the ages by bringing an end to sin and lawlessness, and bringing in everlasting righteousness.  See also  Daniel 12: 2, 3
God the Father is cited as the judge of all  -  Hebrews 12:23; 1 Peter 4: 5

The Son has been given the authority to judge, because He is the Son of Man.  John 5:27
&quot;He has fixed a day when He will judge the world righteously by a Man who He has destined and appointed for that task&quot;   				Romans 3: 6 Amplified Version -  See also Acts 10:42

&quot;For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,  ..&quot;   John 5:22

THE FINAL JUDGMENT
&quot;He that rejects Me, and doesn't receive My words has one that judges him:  the WORD THAT I HAVE SPOKEN, the same shall judge him in the last day.&quot;   John 12:48

If men refuse to accept God's judgment of sin at Calvary in Messiah, and refuse to judge themselves by that Word which is the only infallible standard, then there only remains the penalty for their sin, which is judgment to destruction. Eternal death is the consequence of sin upon unregenerate man.

If Yahweh did not spare His wrath upon His own Son Whom He made to be sin for us (in order to spare us), what will be the state of the willful, the lawless, and the rebellious?   1 Peter 4:17-18;   John 3:36

For each person that departs this life there will be an expectation of a resurrection as well as an expectation of judgment.
&quot;It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment&quot;	Hebrews 9:27

&quot;We shall all stand before the judgment seat (throne) of Messiah.   For it is written:  As I live, says Yahweh, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then each of us shall give account of himself to God&quot;	   Romans 14:10-12;  Isaiah 45:23

&quot;And I saw a Great White Throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. &quot;And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of Life: and the dead were judged according to their works,  by the things that were written in the books&quot;    Revelation 20:11,12

The &quot;books&quot; are opened. In these are the records of all that each person has thought, said and done upon earth that has not been taken out and washed clean by the Blood of the Lamb. The &quot;book of Life&quot; is also opened, allowing us to understand that a search will be made through it for a record of the names of those standing before the throne on this occasion.

===THE OPENED BOOKS===
An earthly court of law proceeds upon evidence. The scriptures tell us that the heavenly court will be set for the proceedings to go forth, and all the evidence will be brought forth. The heavenly court will be seated and the books opened.   Daniel 7:10

1. THE SCRIPTURES
&quot;The word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day&quot;   John 12:48
He is the eternal Word Who spoke to Moses and gave us the Law. We will be held accountable to have obeyed His revealed Word.  Hebrews 2: 1-4

2  THE BOOK OF LIFE
The entries in the Book of Life will be a major determining factor of eternal destinies.  Luke 10:20;  Phil. 4:3; Daniel 12:1 
However Yahweh said to Moses that whoever had sinned against Him in idolatry would have his name blotted out. See Exodus 32:33  &amp; Deuteronomy 9:14.   Also the ungodly  -   Psalm 69:28

Also again emphasised, that whoever turned away and followed the gods of the world, his name would be blotted out of the   	Book of Life.   Deuteronomy 29:14, 18-20

Those of Sardis who overcame the lusts of the flesh were guaranteed their names will not be blotted out.  Revelation 3:5

3. THE BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE
&quot;Then they that feared Yahweh spoke often one to another and Yahweh listened and heard them; So a Book of Remembrance was written before Him for those who fear Yahweh and who meditate on His name.&quot;      
and the promise  -    
&quot;And they shall be Mine, says Yahweh Sabboath,  On the day that I make them My jewels.&quot;  (Malachi 3:16)   Note Revelation 21:19, 20  -  the gemstones of New Jerusalem

4. BOOK OF PRAYER/INTERCESSION
The prayers of the righteous are recorded by the ministration of angels.
&quot;Put my tears into your bottle; are they not in Your book?  When I cry out to You, Then my enemies will turn back  ..  &quot;     Psalm 56: 8, 9

&quot;My face is flushed from weeping ....  .....  and my prayer is pure.
Surely even now my witness [record  KJ] is in heaven, and my evidence is on high&quot;   Job 16:16-19

5. 'BOOK' OF STEWARDSHIP
Accounting is made of each one's faithfulness in stewardship over the things entrusted to their care. Y'shua gave a parable of a nobleman going away and entrusting his servants to continue his business, with the instruction to &quot;occupy till I come&quot;  (Luke 19:12-27)

He gave another parable where a steward was called to &quot;Give account of your stewardship&quot;  Luke 16:2-13

6. RECORDS OF WORDS AND COUNSELS OF THE HEART
The heart of man will be judged by the things he has said, &quot;for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks&quot;   (Matthew 12:34, 36-37)  An account will be required for every unprofitable, worthless word.

&quot;For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known&quot;  Luke 12: 2

He will bring to light all the hidden, secret counsels of the heart, and every secret work.  1 Corinthians 4:5;  Romans 2:16;  Luke 8:17;  Matthew 6: 4-6, 17-18

7. RECORDS OF ALL DEEDS
Everything down to a cup of water that we give to one of His, (Matthew 10:41-42) and kind acts done to a child in His Name (Matthew 18: 5)  are recorded. Consider, even the hairs of our head are numbered and not one sparrow falls to the ground but He knows. Psalm 139:16
Our Father has an excellent accounting system.
        
===THE JUDGMENT ACCORDING TO WORKS===
&quot; ... ... the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear; &quot;    1 Peter 1:17; 4: 1-5, 17-18

&quot;Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man (man's all NKJ);  For God will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.&quot;    Ecclesiastes 12:14
&quot;For we must all appear before the judgment seat (throne) of Messiah, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.&quot;   2 Corinthians 5:10

&quot;eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor and immortality; but to those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness - indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek  .. .. For there is no partiality with God.&quot;  Romans 2:7-9, 11
(Note.  Jew and Greek (nations) covers all believers  -  see verses 1-6 of same chapter)

FOR THAT REASON  -    the apostles of Messiah said,
&quot;Him we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Y'shua the Messiah&quot;    Colossians 1:28

&quot;  to present you holy, and blameless and above reproach in His sight&quot;    Colossians 1:22

&quot; That you may be sincere and without offence till the day of Messiah, being filled with the fruits of righteousness &quot;	  Philippians 1:10-11

&quot;Who will confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord, Y'shua the Messiah.&quot;	1 Corinthians 1: 8

Y'shua said,
&quot;And that servant who knew his Master's will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required; and to whom much has been committed,of him they will ask the more.&quot;   Luke 12:47-48

The measure of accountability will be according to the measure of knowledge of our Father's will, as also the measure of  disciplinary punishment. Indicating that Y'shua is speaking here of corrective punishment for those who receive 'few stripes'. However, Y'shua says that for those who go into unrighteous living that He &quot;will be cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers&quot;   Luke 12:45-46

Vine's Expository Dictionary of N.T. Words says of the verb DICHOTOMEO that &quot;some take the reference to be the mode of punishment by which criminals and captives were cut in two; others on account of the fact that in these passages the delinquent is still living after the treatment, take the verb to denote 'to cut up by scourging', 'to scourge severely', the word being used figuratively.&quot;

The Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) uses this verb in relation to the severing of sacrificial animals  (Genesis 15:10,17;  Ex29:17;  Lev.1:8; Ezek. 24:4).

In Matthew 24:51 Y'shua is quoted as applying it to hypocrites, and that to be cut in two is an appropriate punishment for one who has lived a double life.  &quot;There shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth&quot;  - great remorse is the resultant reaction of the one who is punished in this way.

That which is evident is that all who do not live the life, lose their inheritance in the kingdom of God along with the hypocrites and incur the same judgment as the unbelievers.  With this the rest of scripture agrees.

&quot;But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as is fitting for saints; neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.  
For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolator, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Messiah and God.
Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.  Therefore do not be partakers with them.&quot;	Ephesians 5: 3- 7

&quot;Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are adultery, fornication (sexual relationship outside of marriage), uncleanness ( moral impurity), lewdness (lustfulness, wantonness, lasciviousness), idolatry (worship of things or people - identities &amp; ideologies), sorcery (all involvement in occultic, psychic or witchcraft practices),  hatred, contentions,  jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions (divisions),  heresies (doctrine contrary to foundational principles), envy (coveting), murders, drunkenness, revelries and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I told you in times past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.&quot;   Galatians 5:19-21

&quot;Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God?   Do not be deceived. (Lit. 'led astray')
Neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals (sexual abusers),  nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.&quot;	 1 Corinthians 6: 9-10

&quot;For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift (salvation), and have become partakers of the Ruach HaKodesh (Holy Spirit) and have tasted the good Word of Yahweh and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of Yahweh (Messiah), and put Him to an open shame.&quot;   Hebrews 6: 4-6

The warnings are there to caution us and to guard us from being overcome by the deceptions of the enemy.
&quot;But beloved, we are confident of better things concerning you, yes things that concern salvation, though we speak in this manner.&quot;  Hebrews 6: 9

Judgment upon all sin is certain,
&quot;But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation.  For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Y'shua the Messiah.&quot;    1 Thessalonians 5: 8, 9

&quot;Wherefore are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that through these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.&quot;   2  Peter 1: 4


&quot;Be diligent to be found in Him in peace, without spot and blameless.&quot;    2 Peter 3:14

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE JUDGEMENT SEAT===
The word BEMA which is used for the Judgement Throne of Messiah at the end of the age, comes from a root word 'to step'. It means literally 'foot-room', and was used for a raised platform that was reached by steps. The word became used for a tribune in the law courts of Greece, one for a defendant and the other for the accuser. This word was applied to the tribunal of a Roman magistrate or ruler and this was its usage at the time of Paul. It is used here for the divine tribunal before which all mankind are to hereafter stand.  (Vine's N. T. Expository Dictionary)

In the parables, Y'shua speaks of the angels going forth and first removing the wicked, together with all who offend and practice lawlessness.  Then the righteous which are left shall shine forth in the kingdom.   Matthew 13:43, 49;  Daniel 12:2, 3


===THE JUDGMENT ACCORDING TO REPONSIBILITY===
The heaviest judgment comes upon those with the greatest responsibility.
The judgment is made according to the measure of light given, and he who stood in the presence of the Almighty Himself as the &quot;anointed cherub&quot; will incur the greatest punishment, together with those of the angels who defected with him.   

====THE JUDGMENT OF SATAN AND THOSE WHO WORSHIP HIM====
1.  Satan, the adversary, and his angels  are &quot;cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.&quot;   Revelation 20:10

2.  The False Prophet and the Beast  also will be &quot;cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone&quot;   Revelation 19:20

3.  Together with them will be all those who received the Mark of the Beast, for them there is no forgiveness, for they will have become completely possessed so as to be completely taken over by Satan. This will be a more pervasive form of possession than any human has before this experienced, and it will involve complete responsibility in worshiping Satan. In worshiping the AntiMessiah (the Beast), they will have entered into the most blasphemous union possible against God.

&quot;If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out in full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and who receives the mark of his name.&quot;   Revelation 14:9-11

=====ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SENTENCE=====
Their judgment is to be 'tormented' and that 'forever and ever'. This condition of being in torment is stated literally in the Greek as being  &quot;to the ages of the ages&quot;. And more intensity is decreed on those humans who take the Mark, His wrath is poured out &quot;in full strength&quot; and &quot;they have no rest day or night&quot;. No respite is given them from the torment of the lake of fire.


====THE JUDGMENT OF THE WICKED====
Confirmed Unbelievers, Hypocrites and Backsliders
1. '''Unbelievers'''   
This category of unbelievers is those who have refused the knowledge of Yahweh in that they, by choice, do not wish to retain Him in their consciousness, but rather love unrighteousness and they have utterly rejected Him.  Their hearts are manifest by their fruit.   Matthew 7:15-20

&quot;Do you not know this from of old, since man was placed on earth, that the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment?
&quot; The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.   The increase of his house will depart, and his goods will flow away in the Day of His wrath.   This is the portion from God for a wicked man, the heritage appointed for him by God&quot;   Job 20:4-5; 27-29

&quot;The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.&quot;    Psalm 9:17

For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness&quot;   Romans 1:18

2. '''Hypocrites'''  
Y'shua said,  &quot;Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.&quot;

&quot;Therefore you will receive the greater condemnation.&quot;   Matthew 23:13, 14b
Hypocrites bear the responsibility of all those that they lead astray through the false image they have presented.

&quot;How can you escape the condemnation of hell?&quot;    Matthew 23:33
Because, knowing the truth, they have lived a lie,  and are held accountable for the truth they knew but did not do,  because their heart was evil.

3. '''Backsliders'''   
Y&quot;shua had the most to say in warning people against falling away into unrighteous living, as also did the apostles.   For if we have fully known the truth, and turn away,  we make void the gift of eternal life.

&quot;For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and put Him to an open shame.&quot;   Hebrews 6: 4-6

and again,
&quot;For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries.
&quot;For we know Him Who said, 'Vengeance is Mine, says Yahweh'.   And again, 'Yahweh will judge His people'.   It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.&quot;  Hebrews  10:26-27; 30-31   from Deuteronomy 32:35-36 

Y'shua spoke the parable of the tares in regard to the wicked who would be severed from among the righteous at the end of the age . This included all those who cause offenses and those who practice lawlessness (those insubordinate to His laws)
&quot;the tares are the sons of the wicked&quot;   Matt.13:28, 38
&quot;the harvest is the end of the age&quot;  (verse 39)
&quot;as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so will it be at the end of the age&quot;   (verse 40)
&quot;The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness,
and will cast them into a furnace of fire. There will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.&quot;  Matthew 13:41-42

Note those included in this category of judgment - &quot;the wicked&quot;	 Matthew 13:49-50

&quot;those causing offenses&quot;	Matthew 18: 6-9
&quot;wrong done to the brethren&quot;	Matthew 25:31-46 &amp; 1 Corinthians 3:17
&quot;evil servant&quot; - backslider	Matthew  24:48-51 &amp; 1 Corinthians 6: 9-10
&quot;false prophets&quot;		Matthew   7:15-20
&quot;false teachers &amp; &quot;hypocrites&quot;	Matthew 23:13-14,33 &amp; 2 Peter 2: 1, 3
&quot;the unrighteous&quot; 		Luke  12:45-46 &amp; Romans 2: 8
&quot;the lawless &amp; insubordinate&quot;   Luke   19:14-27 &amp; 2 Peter 2: 9

=====ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SENTENCE=====
The scriptures speak of the judgment of hell-fire (Gehenna) as being destruction, perishing,  and complete physical, spiritual and eternal ruin.  (&quot;Fear Him who has power to destroy both body and soul in hell&quot; [Gehenna])   Matthew 10:48

&quot;The destruction of transgressors and of sinners shall be together and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed (KALAH) &quot;    Isaiah 1:28     (The verb here has the sense of 'to end' or to 'be finished'.)

Note the three categories  -  confirmed sinners, transgressors and those who forsake Him after knowing Him. For this, they have prepared themselves, they are &quot;the vessels of wrath who have fitted themselves for destruction&quot;  Romans 9:22 (literal translation)

Notice the statement -  &quot;weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth&quot;  (Matt.13:42) - great remorse and anguish at their fate.

This awesome fire that will consume and annihilate the wicked is called the &quot;second death&quot; (Rev. 20:14; Rev. 21:8). It is the final death from which there is no resurrection!  This death is the penalty of sin (Rom. 6:23). It is the death Y'shua the Messiah came to spare all of us from!
As Malachi wrote: &quot;For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: ..  And you shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I do this, says Yahweh of hosts&quot;   Malachi 4: 1, 3.


====THE JUDGMENT  OF THE NATIONS====
&quot;For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature those things contained in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves; which shew forth the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Y'shua the Messiah. . .&quot;   Romans 2:14-16

This will be a time of judgment for the nations (the Gentiles who did not know the truth of salvation in Messiah)-- but not necessarily a time of total condemnation,  depending of their individual works, whether they were good or evil. 

&quot;When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides  his sheep from the goats.&quot;   Matthew 25:31

The dividing factor will be as to how they received His people, based on the principle which He taught His disciples that &quot;He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.&quot;  Matthew 10:40

These are people who had not come into the new covenant, but will be judged according to their actions toward His people, and if they are &quot;goats&quot;,  they will incur judgment.  Matthew 10:11-15;  25:45-46

Y'shua said of this time of judgment, 
&quot;The men of Nineveh will rise up in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here. The queen of the south [queen of Sheba] shall rise up in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here&quot;  Matthew 13:41-42  &amp; Luke 11:31-32

In another place,  &quot;Then He began to upbraid the cities wherein most of His mighty works were done, because they repented not: Woe unto you, Chorazin! woe unto you, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the Day of judgment,  than for you.

&quot;And you, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shall be brought down to Gehenna: for if the mighty works, which have been done in you, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment,  than for you&quot;   Matthew 11:20-24

=====ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SENTENCE=====
One generation, one people, will actually condemn another.  One will be judged much more harshly and severely than another. Because the sins of some are greater than the sins of others.  That is the principle Y'shua is stating here.  Some will be judged and condemned, while others will receive comparatively light punishment. 

Some had a greater measure of light than others and therefore had greater privilege. Therefore the greater responsibility. Not all sins are sins unto death.  1 John 5:16-17

Those who have &quot;sinned unto death&quot; and who have given themselves over to gross evil and wickedness, or committed the &quot;unpardonable sin&quot; of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, will be cast into the lake of fire   (as in 'judgment on the wicked' section on pages 1 &amp; 2). They fall into  the category of those whose names were not written in the Book of Life.   Revelation 20:15 

But those who did not know the truth of salvation in Messiah, and who did not do works warranting the judgment of Gehenna shall remain alive in the new earth's nations, learning the ways of righteousness.  Revelation 21:24, 27


====JUDGMENT OF THE FOOLISH, UNPREPARED AND UNPROFITABLE SERVANTS====
1. '''The Unprofitable Servant'''    
Y'shua told a parable of the unprofitable servant in which He distributed talents/money to His servants.   Illustrating Himself as going away on a journey and returning to receive a return from those in whom He had invested His gifts,  He metes out judgment to those who did nothing with what He gave them.
The unprofitable servant who did not use the 'talent' given was challenged that he could have invested it, if he was unable to do anything himself.    This could have a parallel to praying or giving money into the ministry for those who either do not feel able, or who do not equip themselves to bring forth some fruit for the kingdom.    Matthew 25:14-30 &amp; Luke 19:12-26

2. '''The Unprepared Servant'''    
Y'shua told the parable of the Wedding feast and of the guest who came unprepared.   The host of the wedding in Israel would always provide the appointed wedding garments for the guests.   So there was no excuse for this guest to come into the wedding  without the appropriate attire.    Matthew 22: 1-14 &amp; Luke 14:16-24
He has prepared garments of righteousness for us which we need to 'put on' so we can attend the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.

There is no excuse for not preparing oneself spiritually.
Y'shua said that many who were not originally called would come into the kingdom, but &quot;the sons of the kingdom&quot; will not be &quot;chosen&quot;, although they were the ones originally called.   Matthew 8:10-12;  22:4,5;  Luke 14:18-21

Pre-occupation with the things of this life will cause a person to lose their inheritance in the kingdom of God.  Matthew 13:22
Y'shua also told the parable of the ten virgins, five of which were foolish in that they also did not prepare themselves for the Bridegroom's coming.   They were 'virgins', waiting for the occasion, but, they did not have sufficient oil to light the way.

The wise virgins had a double portion of the Spirit in their lives, sufficient to go out and meet the Bridegroom when called. The others had enough for their immediate needs, but not enough to be ready for the Marriage of the Lamb.   Revelation 19:7-8

By the time they had gone to get the necessary 'ministry' to fill their vessels, they were too late to be included. Matthew 25:1-13
A mediocre level of spirituality, even though without sin, will not be sufficient to enable us to meet Him as our Bridegroom.

3. '''The Foolish Servants'''    
Paul speaks of those who lose their reward because they have sown to the flesh, both in their own and in other's lives.  Wood, hay and stubble are substances which will be consumed in the fire of His judgment. That which is centered on earthly things will not stand in the judgment and their works will be burnt.   Colossians 3: 1-4;  Hebrews 12:25-29

That which has been done in the the flesh and is centered in the things of this world, will not warrant a reward.  
									
=====ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SENTENCE=====
1. Y'shua said to take the talent from the unprofitable servant that he had been given  (Matthew 25:28-29; Luke 19:24-26). He calls him a &quot;wicked&quot; and a &quot;lazy&quot; servant,  and he is stripped of what he had received and cast into &quot;outer darkness&quot; but He does not condemn him to gehenna, the lake of fire.   There is also &quot;weeping and gnashing of teeth&quot;  -  the unprofitable servant was not expecting to reap this judgment.   Matthew 25:30

2. Y'shua said in the case of those who were unprepared, that they were excluded from the Marriage Supper and not included with His covenant people.   They lose their spiritual inheritance and those without the garments are cast into outer darkness.

3. The foolish servants are saved, but, &quot;so as by fire&quot; - there is a purging, purifying work of judgment to be effected in their lives, so that they are not condemned with the unjust.    1 Corinthians 11:31-32

These servants who were called to the kingdom and lost their inheritance have their portion with nations in the new earth and not in the City of the Lamb, for they were unworthy.

&quot;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy .   I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in My people;&quot;    Isaiah 65:17-19

&quot;And the nations of those that are saved shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour into it&quot;  Revelation 21:24

&quot;No more shall an infant from there live but a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed&quot;   Isaiah 65:20

&quot;For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before Me, says Yahweh, so shall your descendants and  your name remain.   (an eternal inheritance for Israel)
And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to worship before Me,&quot; says Yahweh.
And they shall go forth and look upon the corpses of the men who have transgressed against Me. For their worm does not die, and their fire is not quenched. They shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.&quot; Isaiah 66:22-24; Revelation 22:15


&quot;Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.&quot;	   Revelation 22:14

      <text xml:space="preserve">===THE REWARD OF THE RIGHTEOUS===
&quot;Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely He is a God that judges in the earth&quot;  Psalm 58:11

&quot;The Son of Man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then shall He reward every man according to his  works&quot;    Matthew 16:27

&quot;And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give every one according to his work. I am the Aleph and the Tav, the beginning and the end, the First and the Last.
Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.&quot;   Revelation 22:12-14

&quot;The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.&quot;	Revelation 11:18

====THOSE TO BE REWARDED====
1. Your servants the prophets
2. The saints
3. Those who fear Your Name

Part of the reward will be an inheritance in the heavenly Jerusalem, the Zion of God.   Revelation 21:3-5, 7
&quot;Indeed Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the world: 'Say to the daughter of Zion; surely your salvation is coming; Behold His reward is with Him, and His work before Him.&quot; Isaiah 62:11; Proverbs 11:31

&quot;Behold Yahweh your God shall come with a strong hand, and His arm shall rule for Him; Behold His reward is with Him and His work before Him.&quot;	Isaiah 40:10

====THE REWARD FOR OBEYING HIS WORD====
&quot;The law of Yahweh is perfect, converting the soul; ..  ..
&quot;The judgments of Yahweh are true and righteous altogether.  .. ..
&quot;Moreover by them Your servant is warned, and in keeping them there is great reward.&quot;   Psalm 19:11

Eternal life was granted as a free gift to all who believe, but not all are accounted worthy of the gift they were given, and therefore do not receive the promised inheritance. 
  
We need to &quot;walk worthy of the Lord&quot; so that He can &quot;present you holy, and blameless and above reproach in His sight - if indeed you continue in the faith, grounded and 	steadfast, and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard ..  .. &quot;   Colossians 1: 9-10, 21-23

&quot;And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Messiah. But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality.&quot;    Colossians 3:23-24;   Ephesians 6:7

The &quot;reward of the inheritance&quot; is a crown of life which he will give to us on that Day. This is the 'crowning' of the believer in the vesture of immortality when he shall receive an incorruptible body and live forever.

&quot;Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.&quot;  James 1:12    
The test of love is when we choose to obey Him above our own desires.

&quot;Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.
And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable  crown.&quot;  1 Corinthians   9:24-25

Paul said when coming to the end of his spiritual journey,  
&quot;I have fought a good fight. I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.  Finally there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge will give to me in that Day, and not to me only, but also to all who have loved His appearing.&quot;    2 Timothy 4: 7-8

Our ascended Lord said to the Assembly in Smyrna &quot;Be faithful unto death and I will give you the crown of life.&quot;   Rev.2:10b

and to Philadelphia,  &quot;Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.&quot;   Rev.3:11

====REWARDS FOR FAITHFUL SERVICE====
There is a distinction between the gift of salvation and the rewards for faithful service. Salvation is a free gift (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9), but rewards are 'earned' through obedient and faithful service. This excludes things done for praise and honour from man as well as that done in self-motivation for personal reasons.  	Matthew 6: 1-6; 16-18

Those who set their heart to be true priests unto Yahweh, will find their satisfaction and reward in their relationship with Him (Numbers 18:20;  Deuteronomy 10: 9;  18:1-2;  Ezekiel 44:28). Yahweh's plan was to have a kingdom of priests, not just one tribe, as it became. The new covenant was inaugurated to effect His eternal plan.  Exodus 19: 4-6;  1 Peter 2: 5,9

The greatest reward for our service for our Master will be to hear those glorious words, 
&quot;Well done you good and faithful servant, .. enter into the joy of your Lord&quot;   Matthew 25:21

Y'shua set forth a principle that it would be &quot;to him that has&quot; that more would be given.   Matthew 25:14-29

Only those who have already proven themselves faithful will be entrusted with further responsibility in the kingdom, and there will be an accountability for that which we have received of the Word to appropriate it, and enlighten others.  Luke 8:11-18

&quot;Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward.&quot;  2 John 8

'''The Reward for Faithful Stewardship'''
&quot;He shall call to the heavens above and to the earth beneath that He may judge His people.&quot;     Psalm 50: 4
(Heavenly and earthly witnesses will be called to account in that Day   Hebrews 12: 1-2;  Matthew 18:16; 1 Thessalonians 2:10)

At the Judgment Seat of Messiah each deed will be tested by fire, to discover whether it was motivated by obedience to the Word and also if it produced silver, gold and precious stones, or whether it was wood, hay and stubble that will be burned up in the fires of judgment.   1 Corinthians 3: 9-11

&quot;Each one's work will become clear;  for the Day will declare it,  because it will be revealed by fire;  and the fire will test each one's work, of what sort it is.&quot;   
&quot;If anyone's work which he has built on it endures,  he will receive a reward.&quot;  1 Corinthians 3:13, 14

Only that which is of eternal quality will stand the test and remain.   
Fire will burn all that was &quot;wood, hay and stubble&quot;, that is,  all that was structured upon the natural life of man.

&quot;I, Yahweh, search the heart, I test the mind, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.&quot;  -   Yahweh is saying that He will search out the motives of the heart and the attitudes, to give everyone according to the way that they have walked, and also according to the fruit that resulted from their actions. Jeremiah 17:10

&quot;and all the assemblies shall know that I am He who searches the mind and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.&quot;   Revelation 2 :23

Y'shua gave two similar parables to illustrate these truths
1. The Parable of Talents  Matthew 25: 14-30  -   Illustrating faithfulness to appropriate what was given

2. The Parable of the Pounds   Luke 19:11-27  -    The resultant reward of authority relevant to the ability of the servant. The focus is on our stewardship over the measure of revelation and the impartations of the Spirit we have received.

The reward of faithful stewardship is to be given authority in the kingdom.
&quot;Who is that faithful and wise servant, whom his master will make ruler over his household, .. ... .. 
Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find him so doing. Assuredly I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all his goods.&quot;  Matthew 24:45-46

See also 1 Peter 5: 1-4,  the crown of glory that faithful shepherds of the flock will receive. Also 1 Thessalonians 2:19 &amp; Revelation 4: 4

'''The Reward for Being Persecuted for Righteousness'''
Those who resist the pressure of the world's spirit by not conforming to its way and continue instead to live in obedience to the Word, will suffer persecution.   John 15:20

We will receive a reward if we follow His example (1 Peter 2:20-23), therefore,  &quot;being reviled we bless&quot; (1 Corinthians 4:12)

&quot;Bless them which persecute you, bless and do not curse&quot;  Romans 12:14

Y'shua's  instruction was,  &quot;love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; ...  for if you love those who love you, what reward have you?    
And if you greet your brethren only, what do you have more than others?&quot;  (Matthew 5:44-47),    and,

&quot;Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for My sake.  Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.&quot;  Matthew 5:11-12

'''The Reward of the Soul Winner'''
Y'shua endured the Torture Stake for the joy that was set before Him of saving souls.   Hebrews 12: 2;  1 Timothy 1:15
We enter into heaven's joy and reward when we are instrumental in saving souls.   Luke 15: 7, 10

&quot;The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he who wins souls is wise.&quot;  Proverbs 11:30

&quot;Those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament, and those who turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.&quot;   Daniel 12: 3	

They will be rewarded with great glory, 
&quot;for one star differs from another star in glory.  So also is the resurrection of the dead&quot;    1 Corinthians 15:41-2

'''The Reward of the Intercessor'''
Those who faithfully engage in this unseen ministry are guaranteed a sure reward.
&quot;For as the share of him who goes into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage.  They shall be alike&quot;  1 Samuel 30:24

&quot;Yahweh gave the word;  great was the company of those who proclaimed it:  kings of armies flee, they flee,  and she who remains at home divides the spoil.  Though you lie down among the sheepfolds, you will be like the wings of a dove covered with silver&quot;   Psalm 68:13 (accomplishing redemption by the power of prayer).   See also Psalm 149: 5-9 for spiritual warfare.

The intercessor enters into the reward of those in the front-line of the spiritual battle.

We see Abraham as the spiritual father of us all as an intercessor (Genesis 18:23-33; 22:18);  Also Moses in Exodus 32:31-34.
Note Abraham's persistence and perseverance in prayer, as Y'shua taught in Luke 11: 5-10

'''The Reward of the Giver'''
&quot;Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven:  For where your treasure is there will your heart be also.&quot;  Matthew 6:19-21

In instructing those in ministerial giftings, Paul says to those giving,  to do it &quot;with liberality&quot;  Romans 12: 8
&quot;He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.&quot; 2 Corinthians 9: 6-7

&quot;But seek the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you.&quot;
&quot; Sell what you have and give alms; provide yourselves money bags which do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail&quot;   Luke 12:31,33

Y'shua said,  &quot;Give to everyone who asks of you.   And from him who takes away your goods do not ask them back.&quot;   Luke 6:30

&quot;do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High.  For He is kind to the unthankful and the evil.  Therefore be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful.&quot;  Luke 6:35-6

&quot;Give and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom.  For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.&quot;    Luke 6:38
The measurement in the case of the widow's gift in Y'shua's evaluation, was according to the sacrifice involved.   Luke 21: 1-4 
 
Ministry to the poor  -  &quot;But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.   And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you; for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.&quot;    Luke 14:13,14
	
All acts of kindness done in His Name receive a reward.
&quot;And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, assuredly, I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.&quot;   Matthew 10:42;   Matthew 18: 5

&quot;For whoever gives you a cup of cold water to drink in My Name, because you belong to Messiah, assuredly I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.&quot;  Mark 9:41

&quot;He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward.  And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward.&quot;   Matthew 10:41
There is to be an evaluation of how we treat &quot;His brethren&quot;  -   Matthew 25:31-46

===SECURING THE REWARD===
All entitlement to rewards  requires self denial in this life and forsaking the things of the world.  Mark 8:34-38; 10:21   
Often following Him will require us to 'leave' those with whom we have earthly relationships.   Matthew 10:34-39

Y'shua said that those who had left all to follow Him, would not only receive the equivalent now a hundredfold, but would in the age to come receive eternal life.    Mark 10:28-31

Until we come to the end of our journey, we only have a &quot;hope of eternal life&quot; - not the possession of it.  Therefore we only receive our inheritance of eternal life when we have endured to the end.  We have received an impartation of that life now, but the full possession of it is only after we have run the race and qualified for the prize.  1 Corinthians 9:24

It is  ..  ..  &quot;a hope laid up for you in heaven&quot;   Colossians  1: 5

&quot;For the grace of God  that brings salvation has appeared unto all men, teaching us that we should live soberly, righteously and godly in the present age, looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Y'shua the Messiah, who gave Himself up for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for good works.&quot;  Titus 2:11-14, 3:7)

&quot;Therefore  ..  let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Y'shua the author and the finisher of our faith&quot;  Hebrews 12: 1


&quot;He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son&quot;    Revelation 21:7

      <text xml:space="preserve">===GOING ON TO PERFECTION===
The author of Hebrews has just exhorted the believers in Chapter five to leave childish things behind and become mature. They have been as children long enough, and they should grow up spiritually (Hebrews 5:12-14).

Because of their immaturity they are unable to assimilate the solid spiritual food which he would like to give them. As he says, when they should be teachers, they still need to be taught &quot;the first principles of the oracles of God&quot; (5:12).

The phrase &quot;the first principles of the oracles of God&quot; reads literally in the Greek, &quot;certain principles of the beginning of the words of God&quot;.  The Greek word for 'principles' is STOICHEIA which has the root sense of 'walking in line' and 'being in rows' and it came to mean 'walking in line' by means of the word of Yahweh.

Chapter 6 begins with the six foundational doctrines of the faith which have been covered in these studies and concerning which he exhorts them, to go on from these &quot;elementary principles of the doctrine of Messiah&quot;, or, literally in the Greek &quot;the word of the beginning of Messiah&quot;, and to go on  to perfection  - i.e to maturity (6: 1).

These six principles of the &quot;the word of the beginning of Messiah&quot; (6: 1), and the &quot;beginning of the words of God&quot;  (5:12), are the same.  These six foundational principles of the new covenant are the same as in old covenant practice, they are not new. Paul states that &quot;the solid foundation of God stands sure&quot;  (2 Timothy 2:19).

The foundation of truth was not altered in establishing the new covenant, it merely progressed to its full expression. Thus, to go on from these is not to discard them, but to build upon them as one would build upon a foundation.  But having once built the foundation, we need to go on and build the spiritual superstructure, otherwise there will never be a dwelling-place for the Spirit, the Ruach HaKodesh, to inhabit in our lives. 
 
To remain pre-occupied with the foundational principles and their operation or to center one's life in the experiences of these truths, is to remain at first base and to leave off building one's spiritual house.
Therefore each of these foundational principles is vital for a believer's spiritual growth.  Each of them is the substructure for the work of the Spirit to be accomplished in one's life.   But, having built the foundation,  we need to go on.

===THE EXHORTATION TO GO ON===
Hebrews 6:1 says, &quot;let us go on to perfection&quot;, What is it to go on to perfection?  

The word 'perfection' is translated from the Greek form TELEIOTES, and denotes fullness or completion, an accomplished end. It is in the sense of coming to the end purpose for which we were called, which is to come into sonship with the Father by attaining the maturity of the full stature of Messiah, that is, to come to completion in Him.  

To come to completion, is to be restored to the original image and likeness in which man was created, which is that of the Son of God. He, as the second Adam was made perfect, passing the test where the first Adam failed. Now as the first of  new order, He has made this redemption from our former fallen state available for us.   Hebrews 2:9-11; 1 Corinthians 15:47-49

Salvation is so much more than being saved so we can escape the wrath and judgment to come, although that may have been our motive when we first heard the truth.  Yahweh's eternal purpose is that we fulfill that which was His original plan and arrive at mature spiritual 'manhood',  so that He is able to share His kingdom with those 'sons' who have come to maturity.

Eternal life is a free gift. But that promise of eternal life is only secured by us going on toward the goal that is set before us.

And as the writer to the Hebrews says, &quot;For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God;  but if it bears thorns and briers, it is rejected and near to being cursed, whose end is to be burned.&quot;  Hebrews 6:7-8

What a solemn warning!

The fact is that if we,  as it were,  are standing still and do not go on and bear good fruit,  we will stagnate. If life is not flowing through a living organism, it will wither and die.  Living things grow! 
 
And, if that which comes from our life is from the curse, i.e. 'thorns and briers',  it is rejected by Yahweh and near to being cursed to destruction. The 'thorns and briers', the weeds of our life, come from the fallen nature and can never be accepted.

Continuing to live on spiritual 'milk' will result in being spiritually immature, a  mere 'babe'. Spiritual milk will not produce the spiritual 'bones' to form a strong framework that will support the formation of a mature body nor support its weight.

Only by digesting solid food will we have the nutrients to form and sustain a healthy body. Our spiritual life must be sustained by a nourishing diet of good spiritual food of the right kind to supply all of our needs.  Hebrews 5:12-14

===FEEDING ON THE WORD===
&quot;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work&quot;  2  Timothy 3:16

&quot;that the man of God may be complete&quot;.   -  Here in the Word is the resource for completeness.

In the scriptures we have every type of human need addressed that we may draw from,  so as to arrive at the goal of spiritual completeness.   Through these precious promises  &quot;we may be partakers of the divine nature&quot;.   2  Peter 1: 4

For,
&quot;He ..   ..  fed you with manna,  ..  ..  ..  that He might make you know that man shall not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that proceeds from the mouth of Yahweh&quot;    Deuteronomy 8: 3

&quot;My Father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of heaven is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.&quot;  John  6:32-33

&quot;And Y'shua said to them, I am the Bread of life..  ..&quot;  John 6:35
&quot;I am the living bread that came down from heaven.  If anyone eats of this bread he will live forever;  ..   ..  ..&quot;   John 6: 51

Y'shua Himself is the source of life from which we need to feed, He is that 'living' bread. There is no source of life in itself in the written letter of the Word. Only as the written Word becomes quickened by the Spirit of Yahweh can it impart life to us from the source of Life, Who first spoke it to the prophets of old, and again to the new covenant apostles to write it down.

Y'shua said to the religious Jews of His day, &quot;But you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom He sent you do not believe. You search the scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me. But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.&quot;   John 5:38-40

Coming to Y'shua Himself is the source of life!

===INHERITING THE PROMISES===
&quot;And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.&quot;   Hebrews 6:11-12

There is the need to maintain the &quot;full assurance of hope&quot; until the very end, continuing to progress onwards in appropriating the promises of His Word. The word 'patience' in this verse is 'endurance' or perseverance, in other words, don't give up. Don't become 'sluggish' or lazy. Diligently go on to obtain the prize and inherit eternal life. 

Part of the assurance the writer has for these believers, even though he sternly warns them of the danger of their present condition, is their labour of love for the saints  (6: 9-10).

Fellowship and involvement in the work of the Lord is an essential part of continuing on in the faith. The bonding and the strengthening influence of fellowship is important and will assist in the growth process.

&quot;And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much more as you see the Day approaching.&quot;  Hebrews 10:24-25

Progressing in our personal walk as well as involvement and interaction in the Body is essential to going on with Him.

If we are not enraptured and captivated by the love of our Heavenly Bridegroom we shall not have the impetus in our life to 
make the necessary sacrifices and commitments  to be ready to meet Him on that Day.


&quot;Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is.&quot;   Ephesians 5:17

      <text xml:space="preserve">A moving average (MA) process is essentially created by lagging the residual term of the time series. For example a time series x with an autoregressive (AR) process of length 1 and a moving average process of length 2 can be expressed as x(t) = x(t-1) + e(t) + e(t-1) + e(t-2). In general, a time series can be represented by an ARMA(p,q) process, where p denotes the length of the autoregressive process, while q denotes the length of the moving average process.

Just to say thanks for sorting out my errors in basic algebra, and particularly for curing the question of Unrealistic Question Syndrome (UQS). At first, when I saw your message, I thought &quot;Oh no, someone thinks that speed doesn't equal distance over time&quot;, but, thankfully, it was actually a useful, and probably correct (I haven't looked too closely), contribution. --[[User:Sjlegg|Sjlegg]] ([[User talk:Sjlegg|talk]]) 12:27, 11 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">American copyright law traces its lineage to the English '''Statute of Anne''', passed in 1710. The Statute provided that authors of books had an exclusive right to their works for fourteen years, which could be renewed by the author for an additional fourteen years.

After the American Revolution, many states passed statutes modeled on the Statute of Anne. Because the laws were different from state to state, the Constitutional Convention decided that the new Congress should have the power to pass a national copyright statute, and added a clause in Article I to that effect. The statute was enacted as the '''Copyright Act of 1790''', one of Congress's first laws. Like the Statute of Anne, it provided a 14-year initial term, renewable for an additional 14 years, and it only applied to books, maps, and (maritime) charts. Over the next century, the 1790 Act was expanded to cover other types of works.

There was a full revision of the copyright laws in 1870, and after that the next major revision of the Act was passed as the '''Copyright Act of 1909'''. The 1909 Act doubled the term of copyrights to 28 years, renewable for an additional 28, and expanded protection to cover all written works in the US as well as many foreign works. Both the 1790 Act and the 1909 Act required a number of formalities before copyright would attach: these formalities are described later.

The '''Copyright Act of 1976''' formed the basic copyright law regime which the US follows today. It provided a single copyright term for works created after 1977: the life of the author, plus fifty years (seventy-five years from fixation in the case of corporate authors). It eliminated many of the required formalities and applied copyright at the moment the work was &quot;fixed&quot; in a tangible medium of expression.

Since then, the main revisions to the 1976 Act have been the '''Audio Home Recording Act''' of 1992, adding new laws pertaining to digital audio recordings; the '''Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act''' of 1998, extending the term of copyright for an additional twenty years (see [[US_Copyright_Law/Rights#Duration|Duration]]); and the '''Digital Millennium Copyright Act''' of 1998, imposing new rules on high-tech works.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To be copyrightable, a work must be an '''original work of authorship''' that is '''fixed in a tangible medium of expression'''. These requirements are often shortened to '''creativity''' and '''fixation'''.

==Original works of authorship==
An original work of authorship can be just about anything. 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) lists eight basic kinds, by way of example:

# '''Literary works''' - Any work expressed in letters, numbers, or symbols, regardless of medium. This Wikibook is a literary work under the Copyright Act. Computer source code is also considered to be a literary work. If a literary work is fictional, its characters, plot, structure and other devices can be copyrighted along with the actual text, but only to the extent that they are original and expressive.
# '''Musical works''' - Original musical compositions. Actual performances of music are covered as a different type of work, a &quot;sound recording.&quot; 17 U.S.C. § 115 provides that anyone may create a sound recording of any composition, so long as they pay that composer a set licensing fee.
# '''Dramatic works''' - Distinguished from literary works in that they direct a performance through written instructions.
# '''Choreographic works''' - Added in the 1976 Act. They must be &quot;fixed,&quot; either through notation or video recording.
# '''Pictorial, graphic and sculptural works''' - Any two-dimensional or three-dimensional art work may be copyrighted as a PGS work. These works are constrained by the &quot;useful article doctrine&quot; described below, which serves to keep copyright and patent law divided.
# '''Audiovisual works''' - Includes films, television programs and any other work that combines audio and visual components.
# '''Sound recordings''' - Any magnetically or digitally recorded audio work (except the accompanying audio to a visual work, which is treated as part of the audiovisual work). Unlike musical works, there is no statutory licensing of sound recordings. While anyone may produce a rendition of an artist's ''composition'' by paying him the statutory fee, they may not reproduce his ''recordings'' without his express permission.
# '''Architectural works''' - Added in the 1976 Act. Copyright in architectural works only extends to aesthetics. If a design element is &quot;functionally required,&quot; it is not protected by copyright. See H.R. Rep. No. 101-735 (1990) and &quot;Useful article doctrine,&quot; below.

===Idea vs. expression===
Copyright does not protect ideas, whether they are fact, opinion or fantasy. It only protects the ''expression'' of those ideas. 


===Facts vs. Compilations===
Copyright does not protect recording of facts that are &quot;common property&quot; and contain no  &quot;original authorship&quot;. Some examples are standard calendars, tape measures and rulers, height and weight charts, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For example a recipe which contains only a list of ingredients is not copyrightable, but a recipe contains elements of original authorship such as explanations, instructions, and illustrations can be copyrighted. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html#recipe&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand compilations of facts such as dictionaries and even telephone directories can receive copyright protection. But the facts ''themselves'' cannot be copyrighted&amp;mdash;only the expression of those facts can be copyrighted. This means that many database providers may not be able to rely on copyright to protect their data from being republished: they must rely on licenses and other elements of contract law. In other cases, the law of unfair competition can prevent one business from using another's compilations of information in an unfair way. See ''Intl. News Serv. v. Associated Press'', 248 U.S. 215 (1918) (holding that INS could not re-report AP news stories on the West Coast for commercial advantage).

In the realm of software, source code and object code are copyrightable, but other elements of a program may not be. User interfaces, for instance, are generally not copyrightable: see ''Apple Computer v. Microsoft'', 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994) (icons and desktop appearance of Windows not copyrightable); ''Lotus Development v. Borland Intl.'', 49 F.3d 807 (1st Cir. 1995) (menu structure of Lotus 1-2-3 not copyrightable).

===Useful article doctrine===
Many pictorial, graphic and sculptural works are also patentable as useful inventions. If the creative component of a work cannot be separated from its functional component, it is considered an '''industrial design''' and it cannot be copyrighted. This is known as '''conceptual separability'''. One well-known example is the Brandir Ribbon bicycle rack, which adopted an artistic design quite different from previous bicycle racks. Because the creativity of the design was inseparable from its functionality, the rack was deemed protectable only through patent law. ''Brandir Intl. v. Cascade Pacific Lumber'', 834 F.2d 1142 (2d Cir. 1987). For more on patents, see the Wikibook on [[US Patent Law]].

===Government works===
Works of the U.S. federal government are not copyrighted. 17 U.S.C. § 105; see also ''Wheaton v. Peters'', 33 U.S. 591 (1834) (official reporter of the Supreme Court unable to protect annotations of Supreme Court opinions).

State statutes and court opinions are generally considered to be public domain as well, because of a public policy interest in allowing citizens unrestricted access to the law. See ''Nash v. Lathrop'', 6 N.E. 559 (Mass. 1886) (state statutes held to be public domain); ''Veeck v. Southern Bldg. Code Cong. Intl.'', 293 F.3d 791 (5th Cir. 2002) (model statutes enter public domain when enacted).

However, other state government works can be copyrighted when the creator of the work needs an economic incentive; see ''Co. of Suffolk v. First Am. Real Estate Solutions'', 261 F.3d 179 (2d Cir. 2001) (county allowed to hold copyright in tax maps).

==Fixation==
''Fixation'' requires that the work be recorded in a form that can be perceived directly or by means of a device &quot;now known or later developed.&quot; Writing, drawing, sculpting, recording and making notations all count as fixation. Improvisational and/or unrecorded performances of music, dance or drama are likely to be creative but not fixed. Something that is typed on a computer but never saved to a permanent storage medium might also be unfixed (but once the work is saved, it is fixed).  Oddly, ice sculptures are not adequately fixed to warrant copyright protection, but RAM copies of data are adequately fixed.

      <comment>Splitting [[US Copyright Law]] into subpages</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Under the 1790 and 1909 Acts, formalities were a necessary prerequisite to copyright protection. The 1976 Act made many of these formalities unnecessary to receive protection, and since US accession to the Berne Convention, formalities are generally not required for copyright protection, although they give the copyright holder some distinct advantages if followed. There are three sets of rules for formalities:

*Works created before January 1, 1978 follow the rules of the 1909 Act.
*Works created between January 1, 1978 and March 1, 1989 follow the rules of the 1976 Act.
*Works created after March 1, 1989 follow the rules of the Berne Convention Implementation Act.

==Notice==
The 1909 Act required that all published works carry the &quot;&amp;copy;&quot; symbol or the word &quot;Copyright,&quot; the year of first publication, and the name of the author in order to receive copyright. Several years may be noted in the case of multiple completion dates - e.g., in the case of further editing. The 1976 Act eased the particularities of the notice requirement, but kept it as a prerequisite to copyright protection.

Today, notice is not a requirement. The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1989 made notice unnecessary on all works first published after March 1, 1989. Notice is still encouraged by the law, however. If a work carries copyright notice, the notice bars other parties from claiming &quot;innocent infringement&quot; as a defense. 17 U.S.C. § 401.

==Publication==
Under the 1909 Act, publication had two important legal purposes: it applied federal copyright protection to the work, and it removed common law copyright protection. Courts eventually determined that there were two types of publication. '''Investive publication''', the type that would apply federal protection, did not have to be widespread: it could be among a small group of people. Federal protection would not attach unless notice and other formalities were followed, but in the absence of such formalities, common law protection would still apply. '''Divestive publication''', the type that would remove common law protection, had to be on a larger, more general scale.

The 1976 Act changed the law so that federal copyright protection attaches upon fixation, not publication. This eliminated the entire concept of investive publication. Divestive publication remained in a different form: if a work was offered to the public without copyright notice and other formalities, it would lose its copyright protection under federal law.

Since 1989, publication has had no effect upon the validity of copyright. It still has relevance to post-1989 works: it determines when deposit is required, and it determines the term length for works by corporate authors, among other purposes.

==Registration==
Copyright registration has never been a requirement for protection, but it has always been helpful to authors. The most important aspect of registration, which applies under all three copyright regimes, is that registration is a prerequisite to suing for infringement. Note that registration can occur after the infringement itself, but it must be made before any suit is filed.

Under the 1909 Act, registration was also necessary before renewing a copyright. This meant that not registering a copyright effectively halved its term.

==Deposit==
When a person registers a copyright, they must supply two copies of the work to the Library of Congress. 17 U.S.C. § 408. The deposit requirement also applies to any work published in the United States for which copyright is claimed within three months of publication. 17 U.S.C. § 407.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rights conferred by copyright==
The actual rights contained within a copyright are:

*'''Right to copy'''. This right includes all exact or substantially similar reproduction of the work.
*'''Right to make derivative works'''. Derivative works include translations, adaptations to other media (for instance, movies based on books, books based on movies, toys based on movies, movies based on other movies, books based on other books, art works based on photographs, etc.), annotations and editorial revisions. Unauthorized derivative works receive no copyright protection, even for their original elements.
*'''Right to distribute'''. The author has the right to control the sale and importation of their work, subject to the &quot;first sale doctrine&quot; described under Infringement.
*'''Right to publicly perform'''. Performance applies to dynamic works such as drama, music and choreography. Any act that makes such works perceivable to viewers or listeners is a performance; &quot;public&quot; generally means in an environment &quot;open to the public.&quot; Note that authors have no performance right in a sound recording, although there is a performance right in musical compositions. 
*'''Right to publicly display'''. Display applies to static works such as photography and sculpture. Generally, the owner of a copy has the right to display their copy to anyone present at the place where it is located: this means that authors cannot keep art works out of galleries. The display right is generally invoked to stop broader displays of a work, such as on a television broadcast or web site. Note that authors have no display right in architectural works.
*'''Moral rights'''.  Authors of works of visual art gained the right to attribution and integrity when the U.S. acceded to the Berne Convention in 1989. These rights include the right to &quot;prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification&quot; to one's work if it would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation.  17 U.S.C. 106A.

==Ownership of copyright==
When an individual single-handedly creates a work, they receive the copyright in that work.

When an individual creates a work within the scope of their employment, their work is considered a '''work for hire''' and, in the absence of a contrary provision in the contract, the copyright goes to their employer. The doctrine is governed by the common law of agency, so independent contractors are not considered to be working for hire; see ''Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid'', 490 U.S. 730 (1989) [http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/1123/]. Some works of non-employees may considered to be works for hire, but only &quot;if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them&quot;: such works include translations, contributions to collective works, atlases and parts of motion pictures. 17 U.S.C. § 101. Courts generally except university professors from this rule: they usually have copyright in their work regardless of whether it was made in the scope of their employment. See ''Hays v. Sony Corp of Am.'', 847 F.2d 412 (7th Cir. 1988).

When a work has more than one author, the authors can have '''joint ownership'''. To receive joint copyright, the authors must each contribute an independently copyrightable contribution, and must intend their contributions be merged into a unitary whole. This is often governed by contracts between authors, but can also be inferred from the parties' roles in the creation of the work; see ''Aalmuhammed v. Lee'', 202 F.3d 1227 (9th Cir. 2000).

'''Collective works''' such as periodicals, anthologies and encyclopedias can be copyrighted independently of their contributions. The authors retain copyright in their individual contributions, but the compiler has copyright in the entire collective work. 17 U.S.C. § 201(c).

===Duration===
The duration of copyright has been continuously extended by legislation throughout the 20th century. The most recent legislation, the Sonny Bono Act of 1998, extended copyright terms for an additional 20 years after intense lobbying by the entertainment industry. This was challenged on constitutional grounds (that Congress could not keep extending copyrights indefinitely), but the Supreme Court's decision in ''Eldred v. Ashcroft'', 537 U.S. 186 (2003) [http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/1526], held the act to be constitutional. The current duration rules are, in general, as follows:

{|
! Date of creation
! width=20% | Date copyright attaches
! width=60% | Duration of copyright
|-
| Created before 1978 but unpublished
| January 1, 1978
| Life of the author plus 70 years
|-
| Published between 1923 and 1963
| Date of publication
| 28 years, with an option to renew for 67 years. If not renewed, public domain.
|-
| Published between 1964 and 1977
| Date of publication
| 95 years
|-
| Created 1978 or later
| Date of fixation
| For individual authors, life of the author plus 70 years. For corporate or anonymous authors, 95 years from publication OR 120 years from creation, whichever is less.
|}

===Division and transfer===
Like real property, a copyright can be subdivided and its parts can be transferred to others. This was not always the case: under the 1909 Act, a copyright was only transferable in its entirety: transferring part of a copyright was interpreted as a '''license''', akin to a lease of property. Under the 1976 Act, a transfer of a copyright or part of a copyright is valid if executed in writing and signed by the copyright owner. 17 U.S.C. § 204.

The Copyright Act also contains provisions for '''termination of transfer''' in 17 U.S.C. §§ 203 and 304(c). These provisions allow the original author of many types of work to &quot;take back&quot; their copyright at a certain date after transferring it.

*Authors of works created after 1977 may terminate transfers between the 35th and 40th year following the execution of the transfer.
*Authors of works created before 1978 may terminate transfers between the 56th and 61st year of copyright protection.
*The transfer to an employer of a work made for hire may not be terminated. This includes all motion pictures, sound recordings and contributions to collective works (e.g. magazines and anthologies).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Infringement of right to copy==
To find infringement of the right to copy, a court must find '''copying''' and '''improper appropriation''' of the copyrighted work by the accused infringer.

===Copying===
Independent creation of a copyrighted work is not considered to be copying. This means that copying cannot be proven from similarity alone. There are two ways to prove copying.

The first is through ''direct evidence''. Some authors (especially authors of factual compilations such as phone books) plant minor errors in their works so there will be obvious evidence of any copying. In other cases, there may be evidence of the infringer's admission to copying.

The other way to prove copying is through ''circumstantial evidence''. The factors in this analysis are '''access''' and '''similarity'''. If the author of the accused work had access to the original, and the accused work has sufficient similarities to the original, a court can conclude that copying took place.

===Improper appropriation===
While copying is a fairly straightforward analysis, improper appropriation is often more difficult. When a work is copied word for word (or bit for bit), the copying can generally be considered to be improper appropriation. The more difficult case is when only part of a work is copied&amp;mdash;for example, when characters or plot devices from a literary work, or a chord progression or melody from a musical composition, are copied to create a derivative work.

The key to improper appropriation is '''substantiality''' of the copying. Copying an insubstantial part of a work is not likely to constitute infringement. Whether copying is substantial is still a difficult question. In ''Nichols v. Universal Pictures'', 45 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1930), Judge Learned Hand concluded that &quot;the proper approach&quot; in answering the question must be &quot;more like that of a spectator, who would rely upon the complex of his impressions of each character.&quot; This is known as the ''subjective test'' for improper appropriation. Some other courts, particularly in the Ninth Circuit, apply an ''objective test'' that compares each copyrightable element of the two works to determine to what extent the accused work copies the original.

Note also that in some circumstances, certain works or certain parts of works can legally be copied under the '''fair use''' doctrine, discussed later.

==Infringement of right to distribute==
Copyright owners also have the sole right to distribute copies of their work, whether through sales or otherwise. This includes the right to import: 17 U.S.C. § 602 bans unauthorized importation of copyrighted works, except for certain personal or educational uses.

The key exception to this right is the '''first sale doctrine'''. Once a legal copy is sold, the copyright holder has no further control over the distribution of that particular copy of the work.  For example, one who purchases a book may re-sell that book without violating the copyright holder's section 106(3) distribution right.  The only exceptions to this doctrine are sound recordings and computer programs, which cannot be rented out even after their first sale. 17 U.S.C. § 109.

==Contributory and vicarious infringement==
'''Contributory infringement''' is a common law doctrine famously stated in ''Gershwin Publishing v. Columbia Artists Mgmt.'', 443 F.2d 1159 (2d Cir. 1971): &quot;One who, with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another, may be held liable as a 'contributory' infringer.&quot; '''Vicarious infringement''' is a separate but related doctrine applied to those who have the power to halt infringing conduct, and derive a financial benefit from the infringing conduct.

The two doctrines can be found together, but can also be found separately. Contributory infringement is a tort doctrine; it requires knowledge and participation. Vicarious infringement is more closely related to agency. A person can be liable for vicarious infringement simply because of their relation with the infringer (e.g. an employer can be liable for employees' infringement on the job). Both types of infringement are equivalents of direct infringement.

The most famous contributory and vicarious infringement case is ''Sony v. Universal City Studios'', 464 U.S. 417 (1984) [http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/768/]. The Supreme Court was deeply split on the issue, but a 5-4 majority decided that Sony was not liable for contributory infringement from the sale of its Betamax VCRs. &quot;The sale of copying equipment,&quot; wrote Justice John Paul Stevens, &quot;like the sale of other articles of commerce, does not constitute contributory infringement if the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of '''substantial noninfringing uses'''.&quot; The Court went on to find that &quot;time shifting,&quot; the act of videotaping a broadcast to watch it later, was a form of fair use even if unauthorized, and therefore not infringing. Similar logic was applied to MP3 players in ''RIAA v. Diamond Multimedia Systems'', 180 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding &quot;space shifting&quot; to be a substantial noninfringing use).

The rapid growth of the Internet has led to a number of developments in contributory and vicarious infringement law. One early fear was that the doctrines would lead to potentially limitless liability for any person operating a system that processed infringing data. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 created a &quot;safe harbor&quot; for ISPs and server operators, protecting them from contributory infringement as long as they (1) have a policy of terminating users who are repeat copyright infringers, (2) adopt standard copyright protection measures, and (3) register an agent with the Copyright Office to receive infringement claims from copyright owners. The safe harbor applies to systems involved in the routing, storing, caching, and linking of copyrighted data.

Despite the safe harbor, some online services have been found liable for contributory and vicarious infringement. The best-known examples are the Napster and Grokster file sharing services, both of which were forced to shut down after they were unable to effectively police their content to stop infringement. ''A&amp;M Records v. Napster'', 239 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2001); ''MGM Studios v. Grokster'', 545 U.S. ___ (2005) [http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/1809/].

==Criminal offenses==
===Criminal infringement===
17 U.S.C. § 506(a) provides that an infringer faces criminal liability in two situations:

# When their infringement is &quot;for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.&quot;
# When they distribute &quot;1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works&quot; with a total value of greater than $1,000 within any 180-day period.

Criminal infringement is punishable by up to ten years in prison (for repeat offenders). See 18 U.S.C. § 2319.

===Circumvention===
The DMCA contains provisions to criminalize the '''circumvention''' of copy protection technology. See 17 U.S.C. § 1201 et seq. These provisions have been used to stop a variety of activities. The publishing of DVD decryption code was deemed illegal in ''Universal City Studios v. Corley'', 273 F.3d 429 (2d Cir. 2001). Later, in ''U.S. v. Elcom'', 203 F.Supp.2d 1111 (N.D. Cal. 2002), anticircumvention law was used to enjoin the publication of software that could convert copy-protected Adobe eBooks to unprotected PDF files.

One unintended consequence of the anticircumvention law was a flurry of litigation involving producers of after market accessories for electronic devices. Two cases decided in 2004 made it clear that the DMCA would not cover such anticircumvention claims. In ''Lexmark Intl. v. Static Control Components'', 381 F.3d 1178 (6th Cir. 2004), anticircumvention protection was denied to a printer manufacturer after another company reverse engineered codes for its proprietary ink cartridges. In ''Chamberlain v. Skylink Technologies'', 381 F.3d 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court ruled that buyers of garage doors were free to reverse engineer the code on their garage door opener, since otherwise they couldn't open their own garage.

===Other offenses===
*Publishing of a fraudulent copyright notice, or fraudulent removal of a copyright notice, is punishable by a fine of up to $2,500. 17 U.S.C. §§ 506(c)-(d).
*False representations in a copyright application are punishable by a fine of up to $2,500. 17 U.S.C. § 506(e).

==Defenses==
===Fair use===
The most common defense to copyright infringement is '''fair use'''. It is a highly vague (and therefore highly versatile) doctrine. The Copyright Act provides (17 U.S.C. § 107) that a finding of fair use depends on:

# The &quot;purpose and character of the use&quot;&amp;mdash;e.g., whether it is for profit or for educational purposes.
# The &quot;nature of the copyrighted work.&quot;
# The &quot;amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.&quot;
# The &quot;effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.&quot;

While all four factors must be considered, they are not exclusive: courts can (and do) consider other factors in ruling on whether use of a copyrighted work counts as fair use. Examples of fair use include:

* '''Parody''', most likely to be found when the work is criticizing the original upon which it is based.
* '''Copying for personal use''', such as the &quot;time shifting&quot; permitted by ''Sony'', the &quot;space shifting&quot; permitted by ''Diamond'' and photocopying of books for research purposes. But if such copying is used to escape licensing provisions (as may be the case with software or technical journals), it may not be considered fair use.

===License===
A person may copy a copyrighted work if the original author has given them a '''license''' to do so. Licenses are often in writing, but they need not be: if the copyright owner gives verbal consent to another person, that person is legally entitled to copy the work to the extent allowed by the owner. Note, however, that transferring the entire copyright requires a written contract or deed.

More precisely, an '''exclusive license''' gives the &quot;licensee&quot; (the recipient of the license) the right to prevent others from using the work.  An exclusive license must be in writing.  A non-exclusive license allows the licensee to use the work, but does not give the licensee the power to grant or deny a license to anyone else.  A '''non-exclusive license''' does not have to be in writing.

===Copyright misuse===
'''Copyright misuse''' is a fairly recent (and not universally accepted) doctrine that seeks to prohibit the use of copyrights for anti-competitive purposes. It is connected to antitrust law and derived in part from the [[US Patent Law#Patent misuse|patent misuse]] doctrine.

===Statute of limitations===
Under 17 U.S.C. § 507, a civil suit for copyright infringement can only be brought within three years &quot;after the claim accrued.&quot; A claim accrues every time a work is illegally copied and every time an infringing work is illegally sold or transferred, so statute of limitations defenses are usually very difficult to successfully assert.  Also under § 507, the statute of limitations in criminal cases is five years.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TODO|Per Future Chapters at Introduction to Sociology table of contents, this module is yet to be completed.}}
'''Social structure''' refers to the enduring relationships or bonds between individuals or groups of individuals.

In a general sense, the term can refer to:
* entities or groups in definite relation to each other,
* relatively enduring patterns of behavior and relationship within a society, or 
* [[w:social institutions|social institutions]] and norms becoming embedded into social systems in such a way that they shape the behavior of actors within those social systems. 

By the 1930s, the term was in general use in social science&lt;ref name=&quot;Merton1938&quot;&gt;Merton, Robert. 1938. ''Social Structure and Anomie''.  American Sociological Review, Vol. 3, No.5, pp.672-682&lt;/ref&gt;, especially as a variable whose sub-components needed to be distinguished in relationship to other sociological variables.  

== Overview ==
The notion of social structure ''as relationships between different entities or groups'' or as ''enduring and relatively stable patterns of relationship'' emphasizes the idea that society is grouped into structurally related groups or sets of [[w:role|role]]s, with different functions, meanings or purposes. One example of social structure is the idea of &quot;[[w:social stratification|social stratification]]&quot;, which refers to the idea that society is separated into different strata (levels), according to social distinctions such as a race, class, disability or gender. Social treatment of persons within various social structures can be understood as related to their background.

The notion of structure ''as embedded institutions or norms that shape the actions of social agent''s is important, because it explains how &quot;structural determination&quot; may occur.  Structural determination occurs when the actions of people and organizations are guided (if only partially) by the underlying structures in the social system. This approach has been important in the academic literature with the rise of various forms of [[w:structuralism|structuralism]]. It is important in the modern study of organizations, because an organization's structure may determine its flexibility, capacity to change, and many other factors. Therefore, structure is an important issue for management.

Social structure may be seen to influence important social systems including the economic system, legal system, political system, cultural system, and others. Family, religion, law, Economics|economy and Social class|class are all social structures.  The &quot;social system&quot; is the parent system of those various systems that are embedded in it.

== Embeddedness ==
Starting in the mid 1980s, a new term and concept was introduced to explain the influence of social structure on individual level behavior: '''embeddedness'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krippner2007&quot;&gt;Krippner, Greta R., and Anthony S. Alvarez. 2007. “Embeddedness and the Intellectual Projects of Economic Sociology..” Annual Review of Sociology 33:219-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of embeddedness is summarized by the following quote from Grannoveter:&lt;ref name=&quot;Granovetter1985&quot;&gt;Granovetter M. 1985. Economic action and social structure: the problem of embeddedness. Am. J. Sociol. 91(3):481–510.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;actors do not decide as atoms outside a social context, nor do they adhere slavishly to a script written for them by the particular intersection of social categories that they happen to occupy&quot; (p. 487)

In other words, human actions are enmeshed in a thick net of personal relationships that help explain the order of social life.  

== History ==
The early study of social structures has informed the study of institutions, culture and agency, social interaction, and history. Alexis de Tocqueville was apparently the first to use the term social structure; later, Karl Marx, Herbert Spencer, Max Weber, Ferdinand Tönnies, and Emile Durkheim all contributed to structural concepts in sociology. Weber investigated and analyzed the institutions of modern society: market, bureaucracy (private enterprise and public administration), and politics (e.g. democracy).

One of the earliest and most comprehensive accounts of social structure was provided by Karl Marx, who related political, cultural, and religious life to the mode of production (an underlying economic structure). Marx argued that the economic Base and superstructure (Marxism)|base substantially determined the cultural and political Base and superstructure (Marxism)|superstructure of a society. Subsequent Marxist accounts, such as that by Louis Althusser, proposed a more complex relationship that asserted the relative autonomy of cultural and political institutions, and a general determination by economic factors only &quot;in the last instance&quot;.&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;Dictionary of the Social Science, &quot;''Social Structure''&quot; article&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies first published his study ''The Present Problems of Social Structure'' in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;''in: The American Journal of Sociology'', vol. 10, 1905, no. 5, p. 569-688&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that only the ''constitution'' of a multitude into a unity creates a &quot;social structure&quot; (basing this approach on his concept of will (sociology)|social will). 

Emile Durkheim (drawing on the analogies between biological and social systems popularized by Herbert Spencer and others) introduced the idea that diverse social institutions and practices played a role in assuring the functional integration of society — the assimilation of diverse parts into a unified and self-reproducing whole. In this context, Durkheim distinguished two forms of structural relationship: mechanical solidarity and organic solidarity. The former describes structures that unite similar parts through a shared culture; the latter describes differentiated parts united through exchange and material interdependence.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

Georg Simmel developed a wide-ranging approach which provided observations and insights about domination and subordination (as Marx and Weber did but more generally), competition, division of labor, formation of parties, representation, inner solidarity coupled with exclusiveness toward the outside, and many similar features in the state, in a religious community, in an economic association, in an art school, and in family and kinship networks (however diverse the interests that give rise to these associations, the forms in which interests are realized may yet be identical (Crothers, 1996)).

The notion of social structure was extensively developed in the 20th century, with key contributions from structuralist perspectives drawing on the theories of Claude Lévi-Strauss, Feminist or Marxist perspectives, from functionalist perspectives such as those developed by Talcott Parsons and his followers, or from a variety of analytic perspectives (see Blau 1975, Lopez and Scott 2000). Some follow Marx in trying to identify the basic dimensions of society that explain the other dimensions, most emphasizing either economic production or political power. Others follow Lévi-Strauss in seeking logical order in cultural structures. Still others, notably Peter Blau, follow Simmel in attempting to base a formal theory of social structure on numerical patterns in relationships—analyzing, for example, the ways in which factors like Group size measures|group size shape intergroup relations.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

The notion of social structure is intimately related to a variety of central topics in social science, including the relation of structure and agency. The most influential attempts to combine the concept of social structure with agency are Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration and Pierre Bourdieu's practice theory. Giddens emphasizes the duality of structure and agency, in the sense that structures and agency cannot be conceived apart from one another. This permits him to argue that structures are neither independent of actors nor determining of their behavior, but rather sets of rules and competencies on which actors draw, and which, in the aggregate, they reproduce. Giddens's analysis, in this respect, closely parallels Jacques Derrida's deconstruction of the binaries that underlie classic sociological and anthropological reasoning (notably the universalizing tendencies of Lévi-Strauss's structuralism). Bourdieu's practice theory also seeks a more supple account of social structure as embedded in, rather than determinative of, individual behavior.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

Other recent work by Margaret Archer (morphogenesis theory), Tom R. Burns and collaborators (actor-system dynamics theory and social rule system theory), and Immanuel Wallerstein (World Systems Theory) provided elaborations and applications of the sociological classics in structural sociology.

== Definitions and concepts ==
As noted above, social structure has been identified as 

:(i) the relationship of definite entities or groups to each other, 
:(ii) enduring patterns of behaviour by participants in a social system in relation to each other, and 
:(iii) institutionalised norms or cognitive frameworks that structure the actions of actors in the social system.

Lopez and Scott (2000) distinguish between ''institutional structure'' and ''relational structure'', where in the former:

{{cquote|''...social structure is seen as comprising those cultural or normative patterns that define the expectations of agents hold about each other's behaviour and that organize their enduring relations with each other.'' (p. 3)}}

whereas in the latter:

{{cquote|''...social structure is seen as comprising the relationships themselves, understood as patterns of causal interconnection and interdependence among agents and their actions, as well as the positions that they occupy.'' (p. 3)}}

Social structure can also be divided into Microsociology|microstructure and Macrosociology|macrostructure. Microstructure is the pattern of relations between most basic elements of social life, that cannot be further divided and have no social structure of their own (for example, pattern of relations between individuals in a group composed of individuals - where individuals have no social structure, or a structure of organizations as a pattern of relations between social positions or social roles, where those positions and roles have no structure by themselves). Macrostructure is thus a kind of 'second level' structure, a pattern of relations between objects that have their own structure (for example, a political social structure between political parties, as political parties have their own social structure). Some types of social structures that modern sociologist differentiate are ''relation structures'' (in family or larger family-like clan structures), ''communication structures'' (how information is passed in organizations) and ''sociometry|sociometric structures'' (structures of sympathy, antipathy and indifference in organisations - this was studied by Jacob L. Moreno).

Social rule system theory reduces the structures of (3) to particular rule system arrangements, that is, the types of basic structures of (1 and 2). It shares with role theory, organizational sociology|organizational and institutional sociology, and network analysis the concern with structural properties and developments and at the same time provides detailed conceptual tools needed too generate interesting, fruitful propositions and models and analyses.

Sociologists also distinguish between:
* normative structure — pattern of relations in given structure (organisation) between norm (sociology)|norms and modes of operations of people of varying social positions
* ideal structure — pattern of relations between beliefs and views of people of varying social potions
* interest structure — pattern of relations between goals and desires of people of varying social positions
* interaction structure — forms of communications of people of varying social positions

== Origins and evolution ==
Some believe that social structure is naturally developed.  It may be caused by larger system needs, such as the need for labour (economics)|labour, management, professional and military classes, or by conflicts between groups, such as competition among political party|political parties or among elites and Hoi polloi|masses. Others believe that this structuring is not a result of natural processes, but is socially constructed.  It may be created by the power of elites who seek to retain their power, or by economic systems that place emphasis upon competition or cooperation.

The most thorough account of the evolution of social structure is perhaps provided by structure and agency accounts that allow for a sophisticated analysis of the co-evolution of social structure and human agency, where socialised agents with a degree of autonomy take action in social systems where their action is on the one hand mediated by existing institutional structure and expectations but may, on the other hand, influence or transform that institutional structure.

== Critical Implications ==
The notion of social structure may mask systematic biases, as it is comprised of many identifiable subvariables, for example, gender.  Some argue that men and women who have otherwise equal qualifications receive different treatment in the workplace because of their gender, which would be term a &quot;social structural&quot; bias, but other variables (such as time on the job or hours worked) might be masked.  Modern social structural analysis takes this into account through multivariate analysis and other techniques, but the analytic problem of how to combine various aspects of social life into a whole remains.&lt;ref&gt;Abercrombie, et al., 2000; Jary &amp; Jary 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Primary Mathematics talk page! Ask questions, make suggestions, plan and write.

== I look forward to editing this book extensively == 

There are never enough good, readable books about mathematics for self-learners, so this is a very worthwhile Wikibooks project. I'll try to draw on as many good public-domain books as I can as I revise this book in collaboration with other editors. -- [[User:WeijiBaikeBianji|WeijiBaikeBianji]] ([[User talk:WeijiBaikeBianji|talk]]) 00:09, 26 June 2010 (UTC)

== Brand New User ==

I recently stumbled upon this part of the Wikimedia project and decided to begin contributing in what ways I could.  I would love to collaborate with who ever else is working on this book.  Please let me know how I can assist in the completion of this math book, thanks! [[User:Sheppard|Sheppard]] ([[User talk:Sheppard|talk]])

:Hi Sheppard, welcome to wikibooks.  I am glad to see someone is interested in the book, I am not sure of anyone that has been particularly active on it lately so you might have to be bold and add anything you feel is missing.  One suggestion, if you wanted to start with some small (but unfortunately tedious) editing would be to add page navigation templates, to see different styles of how this is done you can glance at [[Linear Algebra]], [[High School Trigonometry]], [[High School Mathematics Extensions]], or [[Formal Logic]].  This will give you a chance to look through the book and get used to its style.  Or if you prefer you can jump right in adding content.  Feel free to ask me questions as you go. I would be glad to offer advice, thoughts, a helping hand, etc. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 05:11, 27 November 2010 (UTC)

::Whew, just finished the navigation templates and I'm going to take a break from editing for tonight.  I guess I'll have to break out my old math books and take a look at how thorough the book is; I did notice a few pages that are marked as stubs.  Also, a few pages need to be reviewed.  I apologize if this is easily explained elsewhere, but if its something you could do, or if someone you know could do that sometime soon, that would be appreciated.  And, of course, any further suggestions are appreciated. Thanks! [[User:Sheppard|Sheppard]] ([[User talk:Sheppard|talk]]) 04:59, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

::: Great Job.  Well done. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:47, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

::Also, seeing as there is a Wikiversity project aimed at aiding teachers with this subject, I feel like this book should be rewritten as a tool for self-learning, cross-referenced with the Wikiversity project, which seems to focus on the fundamentals of teaching to others. [[User:Sheppard|Sheppard]] ([[User talk:Sheppard|talk]]) 15:20, 3 December 2010 (UTC)

::: A fine idea, perhaps we could add a paragraph explaining the difference in aims of this book and the Wikiversity project, to help on cutting down the duplication? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:47, 3 December 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">                                                 Wolfberry Juice 2

Wolfberry juice is one of only a few ways to incorporate the wolfberry, or goji berry, into a healthy eating plan. The fresh fruits deteriorate when touched, and so they must be dried to be enjoyed in places at a distance from where they are grown, mainly in China and Tibet. The dried fruits and the juice made from fresh wolfberries have high levels of antioxidants, proteins, complex carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. Wolfberries contain 18 of the 20 amino acids that are necessary to the human body, including nine that the body cannot manufacture and so must get from food.
Wolfberries and wolfberry juice contain high levels of antioxidants that are known to protect DNA from the effects of substances called free radicals in the body. Free radicals are implicated in the aging process and in the development of some forms of cancer. The juice also contains fiber, and because of its carbohydrates are mostly complex carbohydrates, the juice does not produce the “sugar high” and crash from surging levels of blood glucose followed by surging levels of insulin that follow.
Wolfberry juice is often consumed alone, but it can also be made into nutritious meal substitute drinks made from wolfberry juice, yogurt, and soft fruits like bananas, peaches, and berries. Because of its unique nutritional profile, wolfberry juice is often recommended as a part of a comprehensive weight loss plan, and as a part of supervised juice fasts. 
While research in western countries on the wolfberry and wolfberry juice is still in its infancy, the berry has been in use in Chinese medicine for centuries as an all purpose health tonic, and for its reported beneficial effects on the heart, brain, and eyes. In the west, wolfberries and wolfberry juice have only caught on in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but its rise in popularity has been rapid as word of its nutritional qualities has disseminated.

Kristian,

I am professor at Penn State, where along with Profs Mark Horn and Richard Devon, I will be teaching an undergraduate engineering course on nanotechnology design in the context of the ethical implications of nanotechnology. I was delighted to find your open source nanotechnology handbook on wikibooks. Together with our students, we will work to add content where appropriate, especially in the nanotech and society pages.

Our course description is wiki'd here:

Thanks again for an excellent start to the wikibook!

Sincerely,

Richard Doyle (US)

Dear Rich

That sounds wonderful - exactly the kind of activity I was hoping it would generate!

Good luck and let me know if I can help (though my time is somewhat limited).

Any comments and ideas for the overall structure of the book are also very welcome!

With best regards
Kristian

Hi again Rich

Attached are some notes for an update of the nano and society chapter that I once began doing but never found time to finish working on (partly because I missed someone to write it with - so you come in very handy!). It contains ideas and resources you might find useful - feel free to use it!

With best regards
Kristian

== Derivative notation? ==

Is there any particular reason why the &quot;prime&quot; notation is being used instead of &quot;dot&quot; notation for derivatives, i.e. &lt;math&gt;r'&lt;/math&gt; as opposed to &lt;math&gt;\dot{r}&lt;/math&gt;?

Dot notation (aka Newton notation) is generally used for time derivatives and it is consistently used in probably all of the texts I have on the topic of this book (Bate,Mueller&amp;White, etc). It is also slightly more aesthetic, but that is just my opinion

== derivation of Kepler's laws ==

I added a section on Kepler's laws. I'm not sure if this is the best place for that section, but I didn't want to crowd the information in [[Astrodynamics/Orbit_Basics|Orbit Basics]]. I'm not sure if there is enough content in this section for it to be its own chapter though.

The server will either be Centralized, or Decentralized depending on if it runs on ADP on-site or off-site respectively. The system is managed by the Automotive Retail Group within ADP and because of that the DMS is commonly referred to as ADP ARG.

The [http://adp.dealersuite.com/DSHome/ARG/index.jsp ARG DMS] is mainly or specifically for Saturn. Their support number is 800-633-6323.

Although I did get the idea from the chicken patties served at my elementary school cafeteria, which everyone dearly dreaded, this is much better.

== Ingredients ==
* 1 pound ground chicken
* [[Cookbook:Poultry Shake|Poultry Shake]]
* 4 hamburger buns
* Flour 
* 2 1/2 quarts peanut or canola oil
* Freshly squeezed lemon juice

== Procedure ==
#Form chicken into 4 equal patties, about 1/2 inch thick. Season on both sides liberally with shake. Set aside.
#Pour lemon juice into a pie plate and place flour in another. Dip chicken into the lemon, then dredge in flour. Tap off excess, then let sit 2-3 minutes.
#While chicken sits, heat oil in a deep fryer or cast-iron pot to 350 degrees F. Add chicken and cook until golden brown and internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Drain on a wire rack.
#Serve chicken on buns with desired toppings.

== Suggestions ==

My suggestions for toppings include crispy bacon, barbecue sauce (hopefully homemade), Sriracha, lettuce, spinach, tomato, mayonnaise, ranch, and of course ketchup and mustard.</text>

=Introduction=

The theory of applied structural analysis is extensive.  Clearly it entails a vast amount of mathematics and physics,  but it should also put forth some other aspects that cannot always be treated in the same precise manner.  Such aspects may be: sound working patterns, the concept of safety, conservative design etc.  This part of Advanced Structural Analysis is an ambitious ongoing attempt to thoroughly cover the wide range of topics schematically outlined above.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[File:Stress at a plane 2D.svg|thumb|center|300px|Stress at a plane with an arbitrary orientation passing through a point in a continuum.]]

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The topics of this part of the book follow in a rational order of progressing insight into the theory of structural analysis.  At the starting point, &lt;i&gt;[[/Philosophy of Structural Analysis/]]&lt;/i&gt;, we enter a place where nothing is known about solid mechanics except that mechanical structures sometimes fail to work as desired.  The discussion is very general, and establishes fundamental view-points that naturally lead towards an exploration of engineering materials.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;[[/Materials/]]&lt;/i&gt;, basic concepts such as elasticity, plasticity etc. are explained as thoroughly as possible without extensive use of mathematics.  Eventually, the discussion reaches a point where a more sophisticated mathematical approach is needed in order to deepen our understanding of the general behavior of solid materials.  We then resort to &lt;i&gt;[[/Continuum Mechanics/]]&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[[/Continuum Mechanics/]]&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful mathematical machinery that describes the mechanical behavior of continua, i.e. continuous deformable material volumes.  It provides insights that are essential to the theoretical treatment of elasticity, plasticity, fatigue, FEA, etc. and is key in practical structural analysis.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[File:Deformation.png|thumb|center|300px|Deformation of a continuum body from an undeformed configuration to a deformed configuration.]]

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[[/Residual Stress/]]&lt;/i&gt;, follows next.  The chapter explains the concept of residual stress, and outlines common causes and the effects it may have on mechanical structures.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We have now covered the prerequisites of the next chapter, &lt;i&gt;[[/Failure Modes/]]&lt;/i&gt;.  Here the previous sections come together and pave the road to in-depth understanding the different failure modes that may occur in a structure. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Constraints and Loads..&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We are now ready to discuss &lt;i&gt;[[/Optimization/]]&lt;/i&gt;.  Different optimization methods and goals are covered extensively.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At this point we have acquired a substantial body of theoretical knowledge, and the ability to understand the nuances of structural integrity and functioning.  Therefore, it is time to move on to a more formal context where legal documents regulate specifics of how the analysis of engineering products should be conducted.  &lt;i&gt;[[/Normative Documents/]]&lt;/i&gt; covers these regulations, continent by continent, and is a springboard into these matters.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Previous chapters have established a fairly good idea of what questions need to be asked before and during a structural analysis.  Now we find out how to get the answers.  &lt;i&gt;[[/Modeling/]]&lt;/i&gt; covers major topics such as analytical methods and FEA.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[File:FAE visualization.jpg|thumb|center|300px|A visualization of an asymmetrical collision analysis.]]

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Equipped with the knowledge of how to perform advanced analysis of engineering products, we need to discuss ways to control the quality of our work.  There are many possible sources of error, including: data input errors, modeling assumptions that may be incorrect, numerical problems, software bugs etc.  Due to the complexity of most analysis tasks, it is important to have routines and strategies for sifting the errors out of the solution.  &lt;i&gt;[[/Verification and Work Flow/]]&lt;/i&gt; provides suggestions for how to eliminate significant errors from you analysis. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The last chapter, &lt;i&gt;[[/Analysis Documentation/]]&lt;/i&gt;, of this part of the book outlines important features of the analysis documentation.

&lt;big&gt;'''Demonstratives Pronouns'''&lt;/big&gt;

A demonstrative pronoun is used to point out something : this/these for something close to the speaker and that/those for something further away.

In Portuguese there are three sets of demonstrative pronouns:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|-
! Demonstrative Pronoun
! M sg
! F sg
! M pl
! F pl
! Neuter

|-
| this/these&lt;br&gt;
near the speaker, near me
| este
| esta
| estes
| estas
| isto&lt;br&gt;&quot;this thing&quot;

|-
| that/those&lt;br&gt;
near the listener, near you
| esse
| essa
| esses
| essas
| isso&lt;br&gt;&quot;that thing&quot;

|-
| that/those (over there)&lt;br&gt;
beyond the speaker and the listener, away from both of us
| aquele
| aquela
| aqueles
| aquelas
| aquilo&lt;br&gt;&quot;that thing (over there)&quot;
|-
|}


Remember that the trailing &quot;s&quot; denotes plural. Demonstratives ending in &quot;a&quot; or &quot;as&quot; refer to feminine nouns.

Isso and essa means that, este means this. Isso is only used for a neuter meaning &quot;this thing&quot;. Masculine nouns use este meaning. 

#Essa bola &quot;That ball&quot; (feminine singular).
#Este carro &quot;This car&quot; (masculine singular).
#Isso or Isso ai &quot;That one&quot; or &quot;That thing over there&quot;.

Read the sentences below:
#Poderia-me / Podias-me dar isso?   &quot;Could you / Can you give me that?&quot; 
#O que é aquilo?  &quot;What is that?&quot;

&lt;font size=3&gt;Listed below are companies known to have manufactured at least one postage meter used at some point to frank actual mail. Manufacturers of machines that were tested on dummy mail only and never used commercially are not listed.

Companies that only represented and/or distributed meters manufactured by others are not included although some may have slipped in.

The country name in parenthesis is where the company is/was located. If two country names are shown, the first is the country of origin and the second is where the machine was used. Example: Ohmer Fare, a company located in the United States, had only one machine placed into service, and it was in South Africa.&lt;/font&gt;

I've made a new (approved) design for a page in [[The GIMP]] book, but now I'm unable to move the page over the created redirect (though it is supposed to work, maybe I misunderstood).

Hi- I've been writing a book on [Using the 3D Connexion SDK], and I wanted to add some images. I don't have the right to do this. Can I, and if so, how can I, get the right to upload images? (It is time-based, do I need to re-confirm my email or is there some other condition?)

== Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies ==

Hi Mike,
Someone has put a new temperature correction into a page in the Methods Manual for Salt Lake Studies at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Methods_Manual_for_Salt_Lake_Studies/Salinity/measuring_brine_density and I would like to check with them how they obtained the curve, so I can evaluate it against the pre-existing formula (eg what r-squared does it have, etc). It may  be that we should present the two formulas with their r-squared s so that folk can decide which one is more useful. Also, it may be nice for the contributor to pop their name up the top of the page, in the space for authors... My problem is that the user has a number but not a talk page and I am not sure how to get in touch. Could you assist? [[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 01:38, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
:You can write on the talk page for the IP - if they come back, they'll see the message like normal. Beyond that, there's nothing you or I can do. Hopefully they will come back, and maybe even register an account. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:18, 14 April 2009 (UTC)
Ta, Mike. I have written on the IP talk page and will wait and see whether they come back. If I don't hear anything in a week or two, I may remove the new formula to the discussion page and revert to the old one, until I can track down the derivation of the new formula. Is this an acceptable approach , do you think, or too authoritarian? Regards [[User:Peri Coleman|Peri Coleman]] ([[User talk:Peri Coleman|talk]]) 04:37, 17 April 2009 (UTC)
:Content has to be verifiable - if it's not then moving it elsewhere until it can be verified seems sensible to me. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:01, 17 April 2009 (UTC)

== Embedding screen captures or vids from secondlife ==

Hi Mike,

Hope all's well with you.  I'm still working with students on our Foundations of Education text, and their questions are getting tougher by the semester.

This term, they're asking me whether or not they can post screen captures and videos generated from secondlife on their Wikibooks pages.  My gut says that, as long as these files were created by the users and can be converted to the acceptable formats, it's ok.  

What are your thoughts on this issue?  Thanks so much for your help!

== Twinkle ==

I used Twinkle to delete a vandalism page created from a red link on a book's table of contents, but it then proceeded to remove that link on the table of contents. I suspect I should have checked the box to &quot;orphan backlinks&quot;, but the [[User:Mike.lifeguard/TW#Orphan_backlinks|Twinkle]] page says that option is buggy and not to use it.  I had checked &quot;no meaningful content&quot; and the documentation linked above seems to indicate that backlinks would not have been removed had I checked &quot;nonsense, spam, or vandalism page&quot; instead. Would I be correct in assuming that if I want links to a page to remain regardless of the reason for deleting, that I should check the &quot;orphan backlinks&quot; box?

You suggested installing the &quot;autodelete links&quot; gadgets. However, I must say that I have not installed those, as neither the gadget page nor the Twinkle page provide much information on exactly what actions they will perform or what situations they would be used for. Since I'm responsible for actions whether or not I use Twinkle, I've hesitated on implementing those.

A request: could the option for adding {{tlx|split}} be changed to one for {{tlx|subpages}}? I find that the latter is far more commonly needed and the help text when hovering over the option states it's to indicate a split into subpages. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:03, 19 June 2009 (UTC)
:The real bug with orphan backlinks is just that I need to review the code where it's used... it does work, but the checkbox may not always do what you expect, which is my fault. In almost all cases, it should work just fine - so feel free to (un)check it as need be.
:Autodelete links gives you an ''autodelete'' tab. When you click it, you provide a delete reason, and hit OK - then all the links on the page become autodelete links, meaning when you open them, it'll automatically delete the page (and the talk page if it exists) with that reason. Good for deleting stuff quickly with a single reason after a VFD or clearing out a whole category of unneeded stuff, or deleting all of a user's pages.

::Fare-{{crd|D}}well to your bricks and{{crd|Bm}}mortar, Fare-{{crd|G}}well to your{{crd|A}}dirty lies{{crd|D}}.

::Fare-{{crd|D}}well to your gangways{{crd|Bm}}and your gang planks,

::For to{{crd|Bm}}take out Pat with a shovel on his back

::To the shores of{{crd|A}}Botany{{crd|D}}Bay.

*While{{crd|D}}on my way down{{crd|Bm}}to the quay where the{{crd|G}}ship at {{crd|A}}anchor{{crd|D}}lays

:To {{crd|D}}command a gang of&amp;#160;{{crd|Bm}}navvys

:For to{{crd|Bm}}take a trip on an emigrant ship to the shores of{{crd|A}}Botany{{crd|D}}Bay.


;Verse 2

:Well{{crd|D}}the boss came up this{{crd|Bm}}morning, and he{{crd|G}}said &amp;quot;Well{{crd|A}}Pat you{{crd|D}}know

:If you {{crd|D}}didn't get those{{crd|Bm}}navvys out I'm a-{{crd|Em}}fraid you'll have to{{crd|A}}go &amp;quot;

:So I{{crd|D}}asked him for my{{crd|Bm}}wages and de-{{crd|G}}manded{{crd|A}}all my{{crd|D}}pay

==Hinweise zum Üben==
Der Em Akkord kann hier auch durch ein E7 substituiert&lt;ref&gt;Substitutieon: Ersetzen eines Akkordes in einer Akkordfolge durch einen oder mehrere andere. &lt;/ref&gt; werden. Die Akkordfolge D Bm Em A7 - D ist vorgegeben. Dieses ist eine Quintfall-Sequenz. I-VI-II-V + I oder kürzer ein 16-25er. Diese Akkordfolge ist eine typische Endung. Im Reagtime wird aus dem Em gerne mal eine Zwischendominante (E7) die zum A7 hin drängt. Dieses Reagtime-Ende passt auch sehr gut hier hinein. Es ist durchaus möglich, beide Varianten in dem gleichen Lied zu verwenden, um damit ganz bestimmte Akzente zu setzen. Man sollte mal beide Unterschiede ausprobieren und auf die Klangveränderung achten.

--&gt;

== Midi ==
That, wat can not be shown in the Midi: It's a drinking song that one should be sung with much pep.
&lt;!-- de: Was im Midi nicht so gut rüber kommt: Es ist ein Trinklied, dass man mit viel Schwung singen sollte. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Antarctica =

&lt;font size=3&gt;Postage meters have been used in at least three different locations in Antarctica, McMurdo Sound (USA), South Pole (USA), and Scott Base (New Zealand). Most of the stamps can be identified by a town mark containing &quot;ANTARCTICA&quot;, but there are exceptions.

The U.S. stamps have town marks &quot;MCMURDO ANTARCTICA&quot;, &quot;SOUTH POLE ANTARCTICA&quot; or one of the following postal codes:
:: 17038, 96599, 96692 (McMurdo)
:: 10090, 17040, 96598, 96691, 96692 (South Pole)

Two New Zealand meters are known used in Antarctica. One has town mark &quot;SCOTT BASE / ANTARCTICA&quot;. The other has an unengraved (solid ring) town mark with slogan reading &quot;25th Anniversary / SCOTT BASE : 1982&quot;. Other versions may exist.&lt;/font&gt;

      <comment>/* Atomic Structure */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Atomic Structure ==
Atoms are made up of three fundamental particles: '''protons''', '''neutrons''', and '''electrons'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+''' Atomic Structure '''
|- style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
! colspan=&quot;1&quot; | Particle || Relative Mass || Relative Charge
|-
| Protons || align=center| 1 || align=center| +1
|-
| Neutrons || align=center | 1 || align=center| 0
|-
| Electrons || align=center | 1/2000th || align=center| -1
|-

|}


Almost all of the mass of an atom is contained in the nucleus, which have an overall positive charge. But the nucleus is tiny compared with the total volume occupied by the whole atom. Overall, an atom is neutral, and contains an equal number of protons and electrons.

'''Mass number (A)''' – this represents the number of protons plus the number of neutrons in an atom.&lt;br&gt;
'''Atomic number (Z)''' – this is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.

Given an atomic number and mass number, you can deduce the number of protons, neutrons(Neutral Charge) and electrons (Negative Charge)  in an atom. For example, a lithium atom (Z=3, A=7) contains three protons (found from Z), three electrons (as the number of protons = the number of electrons), and four neutrons (7 – 3 = 4).

=== Isotopes ===
'''Isotopes are atoms of the same element containing different number of neutrons.''' The most common example of isotopes is chlorine. Chlorine-35 and chlorine-37 are two isotopes of chlorine, which contain 18 and 20 neutrons respectively. Overall, chlorine contains approximately 75% of chlorine-35 and 25% of chlorine-37.

The isotopes of an element can be recorded using a mass spectrometer. The element is vaporised and then bombarded with electrons to create positive ions. The ions are sped up by a known electric field and then refracted by a known magnetic field. The different isotopes can then be collected by a detector and a percentage of each isotopes mass in an element calculated. This can then be used to calculate the Relative Atomic Mass.

== Relative Atomic Mass ==

'''The relative atomic mass is the mean mass of an atom of an element relative to Carbon-12 isotope having a value of 12.000.'''

This is the mass of an element depending on the percentage of the different isotopes of an element. Carbon-12 is used as a standard for the measurement of relative masses. The relative mass can be calculated using the results from a mass spectrometer. 

Relative atomic mass = (% of isotope  x  atomic mass of isotope) ÷  100

The relative atomic mass of Chlorine is:
RAM(Cl) = (75×35)÷100 + (25×37)÷100 = 35.5

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Mole ==
The '''mole''' is a unit describing the amount of a substance that you have.

One mole of a substance contains 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles. 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; is known as Avogadro’s constant.

The '''molar mass''' is the mass of one mole: one mole of atoms or molecules has a mass in grams equal to the relative formula mass of that substance. In other words, it is the mass per mole of a substance.

For example:
Carbon has an Ar of 12 → 1 mole of carbon weighs 12g → The molar mass of carbon is 12 g/mol.

== Empirical and Molecular Formulae ==
The '''empirical formula''' of a compound is the simplest whole number ratio of an atoms of each element present in a compound.&lt;br&gt;
The '''molecular formula''' of a compound gives the actual number of atoms of each element in the compound.

You can calculate the empirical formula by following these steps:
# Find the mass of each element.
# Divide the mass by the relative atomic mass (Ar) of the atom/molecule.
# Divide all your answers by the smallest answer.
# If required, multiply to make whole numbers.
# Use the ratio of atoms to write the empirical formula.

To find the molecular formula from the empirical formula, you need to know the relative formula mass of the compound.

== Calculations ==

Once the relative formula mass is found, you can divide the molcular formula stated in the question by the relative formula mass, then the answer is multiplied against the empirical formula answer which then gives the new ratio of the atoms in the molecular formula.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} 

== Ingredients ==
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 2-3 tbs Thai chile paste
* 24 jumbo peeled deveined shrimp
* 2 tbs rice wine vinegar
* 1 tbs sugar
* 2 tsp cornstarch
* 1 tbs peanut oil
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* Hot cooked rice or noodles (optional)
* 1/4 red bell pepper, julienned
* 1/4 green bell pepper, julienned
* 1 tbs toasted sesame seeds
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tsp sesame oil

== Procedure ==
#Combine soy sauce, paste, vinegar, sugar, cornstarch, sesame oil and broth. Set aside.
#Preheat a large sauté pan or wok over high heat. Add peanut oil and shrimp and stir-fry until shrimp is pink. Remove and keep warm.
#Add bell pepper and garlic and stir-fry until bell pepper has taken on slight browning. Remove and keep warm.
#Add liquid mixture to pan and bring to a boil. Cook until liquid has reduced to 1/4 cup.
#Add shrimp and vegetables back to pan and toss. Heat through.
#Garnish with sesame seeds and serve immediately over rice or noodles.  

== Notes ==

If you're serving this to somebody with a peanut allergy, don't be worried. The allergens are in the protein part, not the fat part. However, steer clear of these peanut oils: Cold press and organic, which we wouldn't use anyways, because they have too low of a smoke point.

It would be great if any new pages you create had {{tlx|BookCat}} at the bottom of the page to file those new pages into the book's category.  A book's category serves as an index of all the pages in the book, organized alphabetically, as opposed to the table of contents, organized by subject matter.  Having them in the category also assists those who use the reviewing function of the wiki to see which pages have not been reviewed at all or have not been reviewed since they were last changed.  This will help greatly with maintenance here at Wikibooks. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:25, 13 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>Added effect of group and individual medical coverage.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This Wikibook is intended to help support learning about mental health and addiction treatment.  The motivation behind the book is to help build freely available resources as part of the broader open education inititative[http://opened.creativecommons.org/Main_Page].  Students in the Master’s of Social Work program at the University of Michigan are the primary contributors to this book.  The collected works in this book are built on the philosophy of evidence-based practice (EBP).  While EBP is defined in many different ways, this book recognizes it using the common definition that integrates client preferences and clinical experience with the best available evidence (cite).  As this book develops over time, it is hoped that other people with knowledge and experience in the area of mental health and addiction treatment will edit existing material and make new contributions.    

This book is structured around the major classes of disorders.  Within each set of disorders are four subsections that are intended to provide basic and practical knowledge.  The four subsections are:  practitioner knowledge abstracts, case examples, Internet resources and treatment manuals.  Following the disorders are additional tools that are intended to promote further learning and delivery of EBPs.      

===Practitioner knowledge abstracts===
Practitioner knowledge abstracts (PKAs) are structured summaries of recent empirical studies.  The specific format follows the recommendation of (cite).  The studies summarized using this format have been selected based on their quality, publication source, and relevance to practice.  The PKAs provided in each section can provide practitioners with a quick update of recent research.  The focus on empirical articles is intended to help bridge a stronger connection between research and practice.  Due to copyright restrictions, only a limited number of PKAs contain links to the original research or portable document files (PDFs).  However, the full citations are provided to guide the reader in locating original research of interest from a university or college library.

===Case examples===
Case examples have been informed by based on real-world examples from students' field experiences.  No identifying information has been included that could link an example here with a person who actually received services.  Each case example contains a description of the presenting problem and relevant bio-psycho-social information for additional context.  A sample treatment plan is proposed, along with a brief discussion of the plan and corresponding evidence.  Case examples can be used for introductory purposes -- that is, to gain a better understanding of the disorder and how problems are treated.  One can never know in advance whether a treatment plan will be effective.  Thus, the case examples provide opportunities in the classroom and supervision to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed treatment plan.  Other variables, such as cultural factors or common birth disorders, can also be introduced to consider how an approach may need to be revised.

===Annotated Internet resources===
The Internet contains a vast amount of useful (and useless) information on the treatment of mental health and addictive disorders.  For each class of disorders, useful Internet resources have been identified and briefly summarized.  It is important to recognize that the term &quot;useful&quot; is subjective.  For this Wikibook, &quot;useful&quot; refers to being empirically supported  and effectively formatted information sources.

==Useful Tools==

===Measures===
===Conceptual tools===
Getting the proper treatment for mental health and addiction conditions is critical. It should be done in a timely manner and by licensed professionals. Treatment can be expensive although most group medical insurance plans through employers provide adequate benefits.

However, [http://www.majormedicalhealth.com/affordable-private-health-insurance-plans private medical insurance] plans in most states exclude or limit this type of coverage. So it's extremely important to take this into account if you are leaving an employer. Losing this valuable coverage may be hard to replace. COBRA, if available, will offer similar protection for some employees. But the cost of COBRA is expensive...often twice to three times the typical standard individual rate.

:Yes.  This book is in the process of trying to merge an old (and rather messy) book, into a &quot;recently&quot; donated book.  The recently donated book is much cleaner, correct, and consistent.  It may be worth taking a look at the pages [[Linear Algebra/Reduced Echelon Form]], [[Linear Algebra/Gauss-Jordan Reduction]], and [[Linear Algebra/Row Equivalence]] (in that order.)

About the Author

Hailing from Keezhachavadi a small hamlet seven kilometres east of Chidambaram, South India, and born to K.S. Pakkiriswamy Pillai and Meenakshisundaram couple the renowned Saivite Family, Prof P.Chandra Sekharan, as a young student, found his way to Annamalai University where his keen interest in matters scientific brought him to the attention of the professors. He secured B.Sc. (Hons.) in Physics with electronics as special subject and capped it with a M.Sc. in spectroscopy. He was also the most popular student of the university having been elected as the student president, besides during previous years as Secretary of English Association, Physics Society, and Social service League.

He started his career from 1958 for one year stint as Head of the Physics and Chemistry Section of the Tamil Nadu polytechnic and soon after selected by the public service commission joined the medical department. As medical physicist, he was responsible for giving a great boost to medical physics by organizing the first radioisotope laboratory, radiotherapy and radio diagnostic departments and audiology unit in the Erskine Hospital, Madurai. During the above period he also served as Lecturer in Biophysics in the Madras Medical College and his lectures on Nuclear Medicine used to be attended by the Dean and other heads of departments of Medical College.

Later on joining the Forensic Sciences Department, as a Para-medical scientist, Prof. Chandra Sekharan’s contributions to the development of Forensic Science have been of such a uniformly high standards that his standing not only in India but in the international community as well, has brought him to the forefront of world’s Forensic Science experts. Indeed his research and achievements are of such magnitude that he has made an indelible mark on a branch of science that is of vital interest and importance to life and security on this planet.

Prof. Chandra Sekharan has delved deep into the study of Forensic Science. His scholarly publications, his participation in numerous national and international conferences and seminars, his varied accomplishments and distinctions and his illustrious academic background mark him as a man who holds the centre of the stage in his chosen field not only in this country but all over the world. His Lordship Mr. Justice Goh Joon Seng, in one of the cases, he solved in Singapore, observed “My finding there is supported by the evidence of Professor Sekharan, a document examiner, testifying for the third party in the trust suit” (Singapore Law Reports 1996, I SLR AR.V.Valliyammai Achi V Indian Overseas Bank P.453), a rare tribute indeed.

He is a Chartered Physicist and a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, London, which is equivalent to D.Sc. degree of the Oxford University.

Among his specialized achievements and distinctions in research, special mention must be made of his Revised Superimposition Techniques a valuable tool in crime investigation. He has propounded of the skull suture theory and identification techniques via skull suture pattern; He has constructed the Electronic Skull Identification Device (ESID) for the first time in India. He is also the propounder of Scientific Method for Indexing Antique Bronzes and Jewelry. He has also formulated a Classification System for Identification of Fraudulent Cheques written for Indian Currency. His thesis on ‘Studies of Certain Forensic Aspects of Skull Identification and Individualisation’ was published as a book by the University of Madras and UGC. In recognition of his research work fellowships were conferred on him by the Forensic Science Society of India, Indian Academy of Forensic Sciences and the Indian Society of Criminology. His flair for research made him unique to become approved research guide simultaneously in four Universities.

As an organizer, Dr. Chandra Sekharan had organized three international conferences and five national conferences and workshops. In recognition of his organizing capacity, he was unanimously elected as Chairman of the World Congress of the Indo-Pacific Association of Law, Medicine and Science which he conducted with great success in 1989.

In 1994, he was awarded UGC Emeritus Fellowship in the University of Madras. In 1996 he was invited by the National Law School of India University to be its first Professor of Forensic Sciences. In 1995 he was the invitee to deliver the prestigious Bhatia Memorial Oration in Forensic Medicine at St. John’s Medical College, Bangalore. In 1996 he was awarded the Diplomate of the American Board of Forensic Examiners. In 1998 he was invited to deliver the 1998 Oration of the Sri Lankan Medico-Legal Society and to receive the Gold Medal.

His thirst for knowledge would not be satiated until he did his B.G.L. in General Law and then B.L. with interpretation of statutes as special subject. He has a flair for languages. Besides proficiency in Tamil and Hindi, Dr. Chandra Sekharan has diploma in French and German. His interest in Public administration is amply demonstrated by his earlier training undergone in the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore and his present association with the Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi as its elected Member of the Executive Council, Standing Committee and Academic Council for the past ten years.

Though a true academician in the sense that he is interested in and has shown efficiency in several subjects, Dr. Chandra Sekharan chose Forensic Science as his career and field of research. His brilliance in this branch of Modern Science took him to the top of his profession as Forensic Expert. Formerly as Director of the Forensic Sciences Department, Tamil Nadu Dr. Chandra Sekharan had rendered highly scientific and valuable advice and assistance to the Police Department in the solution of many crimes and conspiracies. He has made available his valuable opinion in several thousand cases including the Idol Theft Case tried in the Royal High Court United Kingdom, Forgery cases in Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Singapore. In 1991, he shot into fame as Principal Scientific Investigator in the Rajiv Gandhi Assassination case. He has also appeared as prosecution witness for Singapore police in the first ever forgery case of facsimile transmission. He has also appeared as a prosecution witness in a signature forgery case at Colombo High Court

His achievements in the sphere of public service are too numerous to mention. He has delivered useful and popular lectures not only on Forensic Science but also on drug abuse to officers, trainees and students of the Customs Department, Nationalized Banks, Vigilance Staff, Indian Railways, Colleges and Universities. Not all scientists are good teachers but Professor Chandra Sekharan, as is popularly known as a genius for teaching. He has 44 years of teaching experience, teaching physics and chemistry to students of Engineering, of M.B.B.S., M.D., C.R.A., and .D.R.A. courses, teaching Forensic Science to students of M. Sc.

Dr. Chandra Sekharan has focused the world’s attention on the excellence of the work done in the Department of Forensic Science, Madras. He was solely instrumental in converting this department into a teaching and research institution. He is the Founder-President of the Forensic Science Society of India, member of forensic Science society of U.K. and of the International Association of Forensic Science, Bureau of Police and Research and Development, Ministry of Home Affairs, New Delhi and the Principal Investigator, Scientific Commission for continuing Studies on Effects of Bhopal gas leakage on life systems. In his capacity as Editor-in-chief of the Indian Journal of Forensic Science, Dr. Chandra Sekharan encourages as well gives publicity to the highly skilled achievements of Forensic Science in India and abroad.

Though a scientist by profession, Dr Chandra Sekharan has not lost touch with the main stream of the common man in India. He is intensely human and is ever ready to help the poor and needy, the downtrodden and the underprivileged. His creation of a disputed paternity centre to offer free services to the abandoned women folk is highly commendable. He was twice elected as President of Madras YMCA. His services as elected Club Presidents of Royapettah and Mylapore and District Governor of Y’s Men International movement, Madras District and President of Resident Welfare association and President of the Association of Principals of Madras University colleges and educational institutions are all numerous examples of his statesmanship.

Dr. Chandra Sekharan has been invited to several countries either to give lecturers, participate in scientific meets or to tender advice. In his professional capacity, he has visited London, Oxford, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Paris, Singapore, Katmandu, Kuala Lumpur, Adelaide, Brisbane, Kiel, Wiesbaden, Frankfurt, Rome, Vienna, Geneva, Beijing, Tokyo, Kanazawa, Kyoto, Manila, Colombo, Mexico City, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, Hamilton (Ontario) and Toronto thereby improving that his country is second to none in the field of science and technology. He has published more than 200 research and review papers and made contributions fully or partly in 11 books. References to his research and writings are made frequently in text books on Forensic Medicine and Forensic Science. His latest book “The First Human Bomb” was released in Delhi, Chennai and New York

Among the many qualities of statesmanship that have accrued to the credit of Dr. Chandra Sekharan, one that deserved special mention is his accomplishment in the media in communicating with the public. Through his articles in magazines and newspapers, through radio talk and especially through T.V. telecasts and through press interviews, he has aroused the interest of the public not only in forensic Science which is acquiring an increasing degree of practical relevance in the world, ranging from crime to drug addiction to bank frauds but also in many areas, be they cricket match fixing or railway accident or video tape evidence.

Dr. Chandra Sekharan is a brilliant scientist with a vision, a scholar, a thinker and a true statesman. He is a rare combination of a dreamer and doer and hence many awards were conferred on this distinguished statesman-scientist in recognition of the enduring quality
of his scientific work and social service. Some of them are the prestigious J. L. Eustace Memorial Award for 1987 conferred by the Adelaide University, South Australia, Scroll of Honour for outstanding contribution made in the field of toxicology presented by the Governor of Tamil Nadu, Outstanding Appreciation Award for Service to Humanity by Y’s Men International South India Region and Distinguished Leadership Award for outstanding professional performance by the American Biographical Institute Inc., USA. No wonder, Indian Express (1993) and ‘India West” from California (1994) had described him as an International Celebrity in Forensic Sciences.

The dawn of the new millennium saw   Dr. Chandra Sekharan receiving the “Life Time Achievement Award” during the Indian Science Congress 2000 held at Pune in January, 2000 and to crown it all receiving the Padma Bhushan, the second highest Civilian Award from the President of India for his distinguished service of a high order in the field of Science and Engineering - Forensic Science. Thus far he is the only Padma Bhushan as well as UGC Emeritus Fellow in Forensic Sciences. Recently, Prof Chandra Sekharan was conferred ‘The Fellow’ of the American College of Forensic Examiners Institute (2008), the highest honour and status, the ACFEI can bestow upon a member.

Book Reviews
The First Human Bomb: The Untold Story of the Rajiv Gandhi Assassination
By P. Chandra Sekharan, PhD, FACFEI, DABFE

&quot;No observation is puerile or petty in forensic situations.&quot;

On May 21, 1991, a blast from a human bomb, or suicide bomber, killed Rajiv Gandhi at an election rally. This would be the first of its kind. As the principal scientific investigator, respected forensic scientist P. Chandra Sekharan has compiled a compelling story of the investigation into the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.

The 2008 book furnishes details of sophistication and expertise that went into the first human bomb and brings out the gamut of techniques and skills that went into the forensic analysis and crime scene reconstruction. While Sekharan narrates his findings during the first few frenetic days as a dayby- day account, related scientific information is also interwoven.

A section of the book focuses on the forensic techniques used in identifying the assassin and associates from their skulls, head models, and photographic evidence. Particular attention is paid to the definitions and characteristics of explosives that play a key role in terrorists' activities. The book includes almost all the text, photographs, and illustrations that formed part of the original 176-page report Sekharan prepared for the case.

The First Human Bomb reads like a piece of historical fiction, although in this case, the story is very much true. Dr. Sekharan has created a book that offers itself as an interesting read for the general book lover, as well as providing an additional source of information for the forensic community.

P. Chandra Sekharan, PhD, FACFEI, DABFE, has 45 years of experience in consultacy, teaching, research and training in the field of forensic science. He has delivered lectures, key note addresses, and presented papers in several national and international seminars, conferences, and workshops. He is a Life Fellow of the American College of Forensic Examiners and has been a member since 1997.

You cannot set a time limit for quiz taker to complete a question within the question set up, however you can time limit the whole quiz as part of the [[../../Quiz Options/Quiz Details/Time Limit the Quiz|Properties set up]].  

If you need to time limit some questions but not others or need different time restrictions to apply you can set time limits for [[../../Sections/Time Limit Sections|sections]] within the quiz (Professional version only) and place the questions within different sections.

So to time limit a single question, just place the question in its own section and time limit the section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page will eventually describe differences between the original GNOME and modifications of it by various distributions.

== Debian ==
* Epiphany, GNOME's default web browser, is replaced by Iceweasel, a rebranding of [[w:Mozilla Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]].
* GNOME Office is replaced by a modified version of [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]].

== SuSE ==
* The standard '''Applications Places System''' menus are replaced by the Computer menu, which is quite similar to the Start menu used by Windows.
* Epiphany, GNOME's default web browser, is replaced by Mozilla Firefox.
* Rhythmbox, GNOME's jukebox, is replaced by [[w:Banshee (media player)|Banshee]]
* Gthumb, GNOME's photo manager, is replaced by [[w:F-Spot|F-Spot]].
* The Preferences and Administration menus are replaced by a Windows-like Control Centre.
* GNOME Office is replaced by a modified version of OpenOffice.org.

== Ubuntu ==
* Nautilus, the file manager, uses browser mode (i. e., folders open in the same window as their parent) instead of spatial mode by default.
* Epiphany, GNOME's default web browser, is replaced by Mozilla Firefox.
* Notifications cannot request any user input.
* The functionality to end a session is moved from the System menu to the user switcher.
* Gthumb, GNOME's photo manager, is replaced by F-Spot.
* GNOME Office is replaced by a modified version of OpenOffice.org.

== Red Hat ==
* Epiphany, GNOME's default web browser, is replaced by Mozilla Firefox.
* GNOME Office is replaced by OpenOffice.org.
* The Preferences and Administration menus are organized into categories.

=EKG stress testing=
==Indications==
*(Please add info)


==Guidelines for EKG Stress Testing==

===Blood Pressure===
*If the systolic BP is &gt;200 or the diastolic &gt;110 before exercise, the exercise test should '''''not''''' be done.{{ref|Henzlova}}
*In normal individuals, systolic BP can raise 160 to 220 mmHg.  However, diastolic BP may not raise at all because the body is trying to open up the peripheral vessels to allow for the increased flow of blood rich with oxygen.{{ref|Tavel}}  
*If systolic BP ''falls'' by more than 10mmHg or if systolic BP does not exceed 130mmHg then this would be suggestive of myocardial damage.{{ref|Tavel}}   If the BP does indeed fall more than 10mmHg then the test should then be stopped if there is also other indications of ischemia.{{ref|Henzlova}} 
*In any patient, if the systolic BP goes &gt;250 or diastolic &gt;115 then the test should be stopped.{{ref|Henzlova}}
*In normal individuals, exercise will raise blood pressure in order to supply extra oxygen to tissues. After exercise, the normal individual's blood pressure (BP) will quickly drop back down as the need goes away.  However, in some individuals with ischemia, their BP will not drop rapidly.  If at 3 minutes post-exercise the BP remains at approximately 90% of the maximum BP during exercise, this is a sensitive (&gt;80%) but not specific indication of ischemia.{{ref|Tavel}}  

===Heart Rate===
*More than a few things can cause excessive tachycardia during treadmill stress testing.  However, at this time research has not outlined an objective quantitative prognostic value for what would be considered an abnormally high chronotropic response.

===ST Depression{{ref|Lauer}}===
*The more coronary artery disease the patient has, the greater the sensitivity of ST depression in diagnosing ischemia.
*The &quot;location&quot; of the ischemia on EKG does not truly localize the area affected, with the slight exception of lead V1 (this assumes the leads were placed correctly).
*ST depression in ''contiguous'' leads (like V4-V5-V6) is more likely to be true ischemia.
*ST depression at maximal stress that ''corrects quickly'' after cessation of exercise is more likely to be a false positive.  However if ST depression continues long after exercise (more than 8 minutes), it is more likely a true positive.
*T wave inversion that happens with ST depression is indicative of true ischemia.
*If ST depression comes after exercise (&gt;2-3min) it is likely a false positive.
*True ischemia usually has an onset at a given rate and then goes away at the same rate.
*Chest pain that happens ''with'' ST depression is likely to be true ischemia.
*False positivity is more likely to happen in women, perhaps because women are ''less'' likely to have chest pain that is caused by cardiac ischemia.
*More than 1mm of ''&quot;downsloping&quot;'' or ''&quot;horizontal&quot;'' ST depression is more likely to be true ischemia. 
*Upsloping ST depression, in general, is less likely to be a true event.  However, if there is upsloping ST depression that is 1.5mm '''at''' or '''after''' 80ms (two small bars) from the J point, it is ''more'' likely to be ''true'' ischemia.

===ST Elevation===
(Please Insert Info)


==Pharmacologic Stress Testing==
*Medications such as '''Dipyridamole''', '''Adenosine''', and '''Regadenoson'''(Lexiscan) are used instead of exercise stress testing because they have the ability to &quot;mimic&quot; the hemodynamic state of the heart during normal stress.  The primary mechanism of action is to dilate the cardiac vessels in general, thereby unmasking defects in vessels that may not be able to dilate and/or have blockage by atherosclerosis or plaque/embolus.  See more detailed descriptions below.
*'''Dobutamine''''s mechanism of action is to directly produce stress by beta agonism and increasing chronotropic and inotropic activity in the heart.  See more detailed descriptions below.

===Regadenoson (Lexiscan){{ref|Cerqueira}}{{ref|Henzlova}}===
*A new medication that can be used instead of Adenosine for pharmacologic stress testing.  It is &quot;selective&quot; for A2A receptors with lower affinity for receptors that cause unwanted side effects (A2B, A3, A1) It is reputed to be better tolerated by patients and has is a non-inferior stress agent to Adenosine.  
*Indications - pharmacologic stress agent for patients that either cannot tolerate exercise portion entirely or has attempted exercise stress and is unable to reach optimal stress.  There is a new suggestion that Lexiscan can be used as a primary agent without the need to fail the exercise portion first.
*Administration - 5mL quick bolus after a saline flush; wait 10 to 20 seconds then give stress radiotracer.  All of these injections may go through the same IV access.
*Absolute Contraindications 
**Second or third degree AV block or sinus note dysfunction (with the exception of patients that have a working pacemaker)
**Bronchospasm - patients with COPD or asthma should not use this med
**Systolic BP less than 90mmHg
**Dipyridamole use within 48 hrs.
**Aminophylline use within 24 hrs.
**Caffeine use within 12 hrs.
**Any known hypersensitivity to Regadenoson
*Relative Contraindications
**Sinus bradycardia less than 40 beats per minute.
*Advantages over Adenosine
**Reduced chance of error with single bolus dose of 0.4mg of medication in a 5mL syringe for all patients and does not require a pump infusion.
**Lower side-effect profile
**Less activity in receptors that cause adverse side effects (A2B, A3, A1) 
**Less flushing 16% vs 25%
**Less 1st degree block than Adenosine (3% vs 7%)
**Less 2nd degree block (0.1% vs 1%)  
*Disadvantages from Adenosine
**Dyspnea - Reputed to cause ''more'' dyspnea than Adenosine, especially in patients with COPD but not necessarily an increase in bronchoconstriction. 
**Headache - causes more headache than Adenosine (26% vs. 17%)
**Adenosine can be easily cut off by stopping infusion at any time.  The half life of Lexiscan is much longer and if there are severe or prolonged side effects, the patient must recieve IV Aminophylline to reverse the effects.
*When to give Aminophylline to halt side effects:
**Hypotension with SBP less than 80 BPM
**2nd degree heart block that does not go away and is symptomatic '''or''' 3rd degree heart block.
**Chest pain '''with''' &gt;2mm ST depression
**If patient asks to halt the test

===Dobutamine{{ref|Cerqueira}}===
*Quality of images compared to Adenosine and Dipyridamole are ''inferior'' because it does not create as large of a difference in blood flow in ischemic vs normal myocardium.  Also, it is not as studied as the more traditional stress agents.
*Mechanism - Beta agonist of the Beta 1 and Beta 2 receptors to create increased chronotropic and inotropic stress on the heart.
*Indications
**For patients that cannot tolerate Adenosine, Regadenoson, or Dipyridamole because of a contraindication.
*Contraindications
**MI within last week.
**Pharmacologic Beta-Blockade
**Aortic dissection or sizeable aortic aneurism
**History of ventricular tachycardia
**Atrial tachyarrhythmias with uncontrolled ventricular response.
**Aortic stenosis that is severe
**Left ventricular outflow obstruction such as Hocm obstruction seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
**SBP &gt;200 or DBP&gt;110
*Main side effects
**Chest pain - 31%
**Palpitations - 29%
**Headache/flushing - 14% each
*When to terminate infusion and reverse with beta blocker
 Please see reasons to terminate any exercise test.
**Ventricular tachicardia
**Of note: the likelihood of any ST depression is greater with dobutamine.

=MUGA=
==Ejection Fraction Monitoring with Doxorubicin==
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxorubicin Adriamycin (Doxorubicin)] is a chemotherapeutic agent used in treating various cancers.  It has been shown to cause significant impairment of cardiac function.  The drug's effect can be measured well by the MUGA scan which is very accurate.
*Heart failure has been shown to develop in some patients at a cumulative dose of &gt;500 mg/m², and the risk increases with even higher doses.
*It is shown that a decrease in EF will precede irreversible heart failure.
*Two factors are important in monitoring these patients, the absolute EF and the change in EF.
**If there is a &gt;10% fall in EF below 50% '''or'''
**If there is an absolute EF of 40% '''or'''
**If there is a fall of &gt;20% in EF at ''any time'' '''then''' there is said to be an impact by doxorubicin and the cessation of the medication should be considered based upon the given clinical scenario.

=Attenuation Correction=
*There is some controversy about the accuracy of attenuation correction.
*It is commonly done with either a CT attenuation map or by gadolinium-153 source rods.

== PHP issue ==

I saw that you said you were experienced with PHP. I am trying to do the following (taken from [http://phpbuilder.com/board/showthread.php?t=10367567] where I posted it before):

===Javascript vs. COM Object===
====Arlen22====
I am trying to write a web interface to dynamically give the position of a telescope in xml format when requested. I am using ASCOM 5.0a to control the Telescope. I am wondering how to make it connect to the control software (POTH) and get the position from it. Can you call a C# or VB function and get the coordinates back? I should think there would be someway to do this. These are all COM componants. Thanks.
    	    
====Weedpacket====
COM
dotnet
What the functions would be or how you call them or whether they exist is up to whoever wrote the COM objects.

====Arlen22====
Example?
They are all COM objects. Here is what I would do in a VB Command line:

&lt;code&gt;Dim Scope As New ASCOMDome.Telescope&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Console.WriteLine(&quot;Scope is now at &quot; &amp; Scope.RightAscension &amp; &quot; , &quot; &amp; Scope.Declination)&lt;/code&gt;

How would I write it in PHP. &quot;ASCOMDome&quot; is the name of the driver and it is referenced somewhere else. I am using VB 2008 Express.</text>

      <comment>/* Anhydrous and Hydrated Salts */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Acids and Bases ==

An acid is a substance which in an aqueous solution will release H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Acids are also known as proton donors as they release a proton in the form of a H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Common laboratory acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulphuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

A base is a proton receiver as it accepts protons. Common bases are metal oxides, metal hydroxides, and ammonia. An alkali is a soluble base, and will release OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions in an aqueous solution. Common alkalis include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and aqueous ammonia.


== Salts ==

A salt is produced during neutralisation: the reaction of an acid with a base, alkali or carbonate. The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion of an acid is replaced by a metal ion or NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Here are some common reactions:
* Acid + Base → Salt + Water
* Acid + Alkali → Salt + Water
* Acid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen
* Acid + Carbonate → Salt + Carbon Dioxide + Water

A base readily accepts H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions from an acid: for example, OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; forming NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Anhydrous and Hydrated Salts ===
Solid salts consist of a lattice of positive and negative ions, sometimes water molecules are incorporated into the lattice.&lt;br&gt; 
The water in a lattice is called the '''water of crystallisation''', 
When a salt contains water the salt is '''hydrated''', if a salt does not contain water of crystallisation the salt is '''anhydrous'''.

A mole of a particular hydrated salt always has the same number of moles of water of crystallisation, its formula shows how many water molecules are present for every molecule of salt&lt;br&gt;
eg. copper sulfate, CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, has 5 moles of water for every mole of salt, therefore its hydrated formula is CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, (a dot seperates the salts formula from the water of crystallisation).

Many hydrated salts lose their water of crystallisation when heated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

'''Freezing''' is the process of subjecting foods to temperatures below 0°C or 32°F. Foods are generally frozen to create the final form (see [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|Vanilla Ice Cream]]), to preserve for later use, or to freeze-dry a food.  Depending on its molecular content, i.e. whether the item has a high concentration of salt, sugar, or alcohol, a food may not become solid at the freezing point of water.  Home freezers should be kept at or below 0°F to compensate for the differing freezing points of various foods as well as temperature fluctuations that occur through use of the freezer.

==Freezing for later use==
To preserve a food by freezing, it should be well wrapped or stored in a freezer-safe container to prevent freezer burn.  Generally, [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] should be [[Cookbook:Blanching|blanched]] or cooked before being frozen.  Some [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]], [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat and poultry]] can be frozen without being cooked beforehand.  Other fruits, like apples or pears, benefit from being cooked before being frozen.  Certain foods, such as [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], have dramatically altered textures after being frozen.  The longer a food is to be stored, the more careful the cook needs to be in selecting and properly using the correct packaging.  Vacuum bags are one option for the home cook who intends to store food for more than three months.

Storing dry foods inclined to become rancid, such as rarely used [[Cookbook:Nuts and seeds|nuts]], or whole-grain [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], in the freezer is recommended by some cooking authorities.  Ingredients should be brought to room temperature, in their sealed packing, before using to prevent condensation from affecting the food's dryness.

==Freezing for form==
Freezing changes the food's texture into a solid mass, as can be seen when water turns into ice.  Incorporating air into the mixture to be frozen can help create a lighter mass, as when [[Cookbook:cream|cream]] is whipped before being used to create a frozen mousse.

==Freeze-drying==
Freeze-drying is used in commercial facilities.  The food is brought to a temperature below the point at which the solid (frozen) and liquid states can occur, allowing moisture to sublime off into the atmosphere.  Freeze-dried foods are shelf-stable at room temperature, and may retain better flavors and textures than conventionally dried foods.

== Ingredients ==
* 24 chicken wings, tips removed, cut in half at the joint
* 1 1/4 cups [[Cookbook:Kansas City Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]]
* 2 tbs paprika
* 2 tbs lemon-pepper
* 1 tbs salt
* 1 tbs black peppercorns, cracked
* 1 1/2 tbs ground cayenne pepper (optional)
* 1/2x3 hickory wood chips
'''Equipment'''
* A kettle-style charcoal grill
* A large chimney starter
* Natural chunk or hardwood lump charcoal

== Procedure ==
#Combine seasonings and toss with wings. Brush wings on all sides with sauce and refrigerate as long as possible.
#Preheat 4 1/2 pounds charcoal in the chimney. Disperse evenly around bottom of grill, then reapply grate.
#Add chicken and cook, turning often, until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.
#Remove to a plate and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==

If you do not know how to use a chimney starter, use a gas grill, or believe the people who sell sickening solvent that they light by being soaked in a chemical, this is how you do it. First, wad up a sheet of newspaper and moisten it with 1-2 tsp vegetable oil. Place it in the bottom compartment, and place your coals in the top compartment. Light, go grab a beer, and wait until the coals are covered with a grey ash, about 15 minutes on good weather. Disperse and cook.</text>

You know, for some crazy reason, almost all fish work great with Asian flavors, including salmon.

== Ingredients ==
:4 (6-ounce) wild salmon filets with skin, pin bones removed
:1/3 cup soy sauce
:3 tbs rice wine vinegar
:1 tbs red pepper flake
:2 tsp curry powder
:1 tbs minced ginger
:5 cloves garlic, smashed and minced
:1/4 cup olive oil
:2 tbs dark brown sugar
:1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
:2 tbs basil chiffonade
:2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
:1 1/2 tbs curry paste
'''Equipment'''
:A kettle-style charcoal grill
:A blender or food processor
:Gallon-size zip-top plastic bag
:A kitchen towel tied into a roll with kitchen twine and soaked in vegetable oil
:A chimney starter
:Natural chunk or hardwood lump charcoal

== Directions ==
#Process all ingredients except herbs and salmon until smooth. Pour into plastic bag and add salmon; toss to coat. Seal, getting as much air out as possible, and refrigerate up to 4 hours.
#In four hours, preheat 4 1/2 lb. charcoal in chimney. Disperse evenly around the bottom of the grill and reapply grate.
#While charcoal heats, remove salmon from marinade. Discard remaining marinade. Let sit at room temperature until coals have heated.
#Once the grate is hot, quickly swab the grate with the towel. Add salmon to the hottest part, skin side up, and cook 3-5 minutes per side for medium, turning 90 degrees halfway to mark.
#Remove to a plate and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Let rest 5 minutes.
#Move salmon to warmed inividual plates, sprinkle with chopped herbs, and garnish with citrus wedges, if desired. Serve immediately.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Bone Mineral Density'''&lt;/big&gt;
= DXA Scan =
== Indications ==
=== Established Risk Factors for Osteoporosis ===
* Age greater than 65
* Gender - At the same age, females are at higher risk than males for an osteoporotic fracture in general. However, males are at higher risk for a hip fracture specifically. 
* Weight and Height (Body Mass Index)
* A personal or family history of fracture from something simple like a fall or minor bump (also described as a &quot;fragility fracture&quot;)
* Other causes such as certain drugs like steroids or chemotherapy
* Various metabolic conditions that put one at risk for low bone density:
** Type I Diebetes
** Long-standing untreated Hyperthyroidism
** Hyperparathyroidism
** Hypogonadism - high risk for males but normal if a female has had menopause after the age of '''45'''
** Rheumatoid arthritis
* Smoking
* Consuming &gt;3 alcoholic beverages per day

=== Appropriate ordering of DXA scans ===
* '''In any patient''', there are certain indications for scanning that do not require further stratification:
** Any personal history of fragility fractures?(like a fracture from a simple bump or low-impact fall) -&gt; Scanning is appropriate.
** Prior scanning showing low bone density? -&gt; Follow up scanning is appropriate.
** Prior scanning normal but secondary causes for potential interval bone loss are significant and/or expected.

* '''All other patients:'''
** ''Males''
*** Low risk factors? -&gt; Follow up visit for reevaluation only, no definite age is known for screening DXA
*** High risk factors (as above) or with clinical suspicion of low bone density -&gt; Scanning is appropriate
** ''Females''
*** Greater than 65 y/o? -&gt; Scanning is appropriate
*** Less than 65 y/o?:
**** High risk factors (as above) or with clinical suspicion of low bone density -&gt; Scanning is appropriate.
**** Low risk factors -&gt; Follow-up reevaluation only.

== How To Read a DXA scan ==
=== Visual Analysis ===
* '''Hip'''
** Attention needs to be given to anything which might alter the BMD, such as overlap of the hip with the ischium or dense foreign bodies. Anything aberrant density that exists within the background ROI or the ROI that draws the total hip or femoral neck will change bone density.
** If a corner of the femoral neck ROI does include part of the ischium, this usually can be manually excluded by the technologist performing the exam.
** Optimal rotation of the hip allows you to just see the lesser trochanter, which helps the computer to draw the ROIs correctly.
** Many hips have prostheses such as a hip replacement. Obviously, this cannot be used and the other hip or the forearm should be used for analysis instead.

* '''Spine'''
** Significant sclerosis or scolioses should be noted and likely elevates the bone density in the spine. When describing these findings, try to not use clinical diagnoses such as &quot;osteoarthritis of the spine,&quot; which is a clinical diagnosis and not a radiological finding. The correct term could be &quot;sclerosis.&quot; When there is a significant amount of sclerosis, this could be due to compression fracture (see below) or degenerative changes. As patients age, sclerosis may sequentially increase over time which may cause longitudinal measurements to increase or stay the same in cases when the patient's overall bone density is decreasing over time. For these reasons, it is wise to image more than one region of the body.
** Compression fractures need to be described. There is some controversy about whether or not interpreting clinicians should use DXA to screen for fractures, but it is possible with with alternate techniques. Using appropriate scanning technique, this is sometimes called visual fracture analysis (VFA) and can be billed for in some cases. Please note that a compression fracture may be a sole indicator for treatment despite a normal DXA measurement. It is especially important to carefully observe any changes in the angle of the spine or clear changes in vertebral height. One can correlate these changes with a new-onset back pain. Most clinicians order a diagnostic radiograph of the lumbar spine if something is concerning on the DXA.

=== T vs Z scores ===
* T-scores
** Used for women
***Postmenopausal - no longer having periods
***Peri-menopausal - periods becoming irregular or becoming more spaced in interval
** Used for men ≥ 50 y/o
* Z-scores
** Used for pre-menopausal women, children, and all men &lt; 50 y/o

=== WHO Classification ===
* See the table at the bottom of this page for WHO classification for postmenopausal osteoporosis
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Diagnosis !! T-score
|-
| Normal|| '''≥''' -1.0
|-
| Low Bone Mass (&quot;Osteopenia,&quot; &quot;Low Bone Density&quot;)|| '''&gt;''' -2.5 and '''&lt;''' -1.0
|-
| Osteoporosis || '''≤''' -2.5
|-
| Severe (&quot;Established&quot;) Osteoporosis || '''≤''' -2.5 for young-adult women, with a history of fragility fracture
|-}

== FRAX Calculation ==
=== WHO Fracture Risk (FRAX){{ref|Lewiecki}} ===
*WHY USE THIS?
**There confusion about when to treat patients pharmacologically in borderline cases.
**FRAX calculation is used to make pharmacologic treatment decisions which can be defined as '''treatment outside of Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation such as with a bisphosphonate'''. This definition is often insufficient because of other new types of treatment (i.e. Evista)
**Calculation can be applied to all patients aged 40-90 y/o.
**'''A known fragility fracture is a sole indication for treatment and should be included as a disclaimer when FRAX risk does not meet the threshold for treatment'''.
**It is found that simply using a T-score in bone mineral density (BMD) has been shown to be insufficient in assessing fracture risk in patients and is not ideal as a sole indicator in guiding bone-building or bone-retaining pharmacological treatment outside of normal vitamin D and calcium supplementation.  Additionally, there is a general feeling in the public and in medicine that if you have &quot;Osteopenia&quot; or &quot;Low bone density&quot; that these are entities that require treatment. However, solely using these diagnoses for treatment decisions is controversial and does not carry the best support in the evidence-based literature.  
**FRAX is a means to add clinical risk factors to the measurement of bone density, as a means for making treatment decisions. A study of approximately 60,000 patients (40-90 yr old men and women) was used to stratify the risk of fracture as it applied to the BMD of the ''femoral neck'' and/or various indicators in the patient's past medical history. This data was used to form a calculation tool to help guide treatment, called '''FRAX''' (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool).  This tool can be found online and can give very helpful specified information with variables including race and nationality.{{ref|Kanis}}
*A calculated 10 year FRAX risk of fracture of '''at least 3%''' at the hip, and '''at least 20%''' for a &quot;major osteoporotic fracture,&quot; would indicate that the patient would benefit from pharmacological treatment.{{ref|Lewiecki}}
*It must be noted that ''FRAX'' is not intended to be used as a sole determinant in &quot;treat vs not treat.&quot;  The consensus appears to be that a variety of clear indications for treatment exist, that may include:
**History of vertebral or hip fracture that is felt to be caused by low BMD.
**A diagnosis of '''primary osteoporosis''' - This diagnosis is made ''only'' if other treatable, non-primary causes of osteoporosis have been ruled out ''and'' the patient has a T-score that is less than or equal to '''-2.5''' (also signifying -2.5 standard deviations from the mean).
**It must be remembered that the first consideration for treatment in patients with ''secondary'' osteoporosis (caused by hyperparathyroidism or corticosteroid use, for example) should be focused on approach to correct the secondary cause. However, it is yet reasonable to pharmacologically treat the patient if the clinical scenario indicates it. This must be approached on an individual, clinical basis.
**It is also reasonable to initiate pharmacologic treatment if any of the above criteria are not completely satisfied, based upon additional risk factors that may or may have not been included in the WHO fracture study. These decisions are usually up to the patient's primary care provider.

=== Interpreting FRAX calculation ===
*Using a DXA measurement of the femoral neck, FRAX is calculated with at least the following information:
**'''Current Smoking'''
**'''Consumption of &gt;3 alcoholic beverages a day'''
**'''Rheumatoid Arthritis'''
**'''Glucocorticoid use''' such as Prednisone, at any time of life - '''5mg/day for equal to or more than 3 months''' (not necessarily consecutive).
**'''Personal history of fracture not caused by a minor incident such as a low-impact fall'''.  For example, high impact fractures.
**'''Family history of fracture not caused by a minor incident such as a low-impact fall'''.
**'''Age'''
***FRAX ''cannot be calculated'' for any patient less than 40 y/o or above 90 y/o.
**'''Weight''' 
***If the patient's weight is greater than 125Kg the patient's FRAX can be calculated, but is assumed to be a maximum weight of 125Kg for calculation.
**'''Race'''
***This is key!  For example, African-Americans have been found to have less risk of fracture at the same BMD.
**FRAX can be calculated without the DXA scan BMD of the femoral neck; however, it may be more desirable to apply an objective measurement.
***In order to calculate FRAX without the DXA, personal risk factors and any and all causes of secondary osteoporosis must be comprehensively inquired in order to correctly stratify the patient's fracture risk.  This can be done in the primary care setting without the need for any equipment other than internet access.  ''This particular information is important to the interpretation of the DXA scan because with the use of a femoral neck BMD, it is no longer necessary to consider causes of secondary osteoporosis other than those listed above.

== Reporting Findings ==
=== A brief outline of the findings should include: ===
*A declaration of the body part(s) studied using a definable type of equipment and technique.
*Any visual deformities of the body parts of interest or issues precluding diagnosis.
*The densities of the areas of interest and associated T or Z scores.
*The change in bone densities since last study and/or since the highest/lowest density the patient has had in the past.
*FRAX calculation (if indicated)
*Recommendations

== Follow-Up scanning ==
*According to the ISCD Follow-up is appropriate when the expected change in BMD is '''≥''' the LSC
*Using the LSC alone as an indication of when to call something &quot;significantly changed&quot; is erroneous information and does not account for the expected change in BMD for a certain ROI with a certain type of therapy.
*The Monitoring Time Interval (MTI) can be calculated using the LSC:
&lt;math&gt; MTI = \frac {LSC}{(expected\ %\bigtriangleup per year)}\ &lt;/math&gt;
*When the MTI is '''≤''' 1.0 the measured change has exceeded the expected change for a given institution, treatment, and patient.  Therefore, a repeat BMD at or after this time will result in clinically relevant information.
*LSC is calculated per the standards laid out by the ISCD (see iscd.org).
*Expected change per year is dependent on therapy type and where you measure.
*A simple method is to scan one year after initiating or changing therapy, and then at less frequent intervals once a pattern is evident.

Yes definitely delete it - I am the guilty person who created this page and then lost it (because I had miss-spelt the name) in my early attempts at working with Wikibooks.  Is there no way that an author can just go and delete pages that they have written and that no one else has contributed to? [[User:Hskeet|Hskeet]] ([[User talk:Hskeet|talk]]) 07:46, 13 August 2009 (UTC)

:There is.  One of the grounds for speedy deletion is nomination by the sole author.  So the sole author can just put a tag at the top of the page, something like
::{{tlx|delete|nominated by sole author}}

#cook under medium to high heat (watch so it does not boil over) for about 25 minutes or until peppers seem soft (all ingredients are already cooked so it is a matter of taste, soft and squishy or al dente peppers!

I accidentally spilled some coffee liqueur on a brownie I was about to eat, and when I tried it it was heavenly. That is how I came up with this dish.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 brownie squares, 6x6 and 1 1/4 inch thick
* 1/2 cup coffee liqueur
* Warm hot fudge topping, poured into a squirt bottle
* 4 scoops vanilla ice cream
* Mixed nut topping (optional)
* Mint sprigs, for garnish
* Sweetened whipped cream

== Procedure ==
#Place 1 square on a microwave safe plate and microwave on high 20 seconds or until desired warmth. Repeat with next 4 squares.
#Slowly bring liqueur to a boil in a pan over low heat. Drizzle evenly over brownie squares.
#Place a scoop of ice cream on each square and top with a good amount of whipped cream. Drizzle the whole thing with hot fudge and sprinkle with nut topping, if using.
#Garnish with mint sprigs, if desired. Serve immediately.

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==

Walnut brownies work very well in this dish.

== Warnings ==

Don't try to speed up the liqueur by raising the heat. If you're working on an open-flame stovetop, that could result in something that is red and burns taking over your house.</text>

__TOC__

== What Is an RBAC System? ==

A [[w:Role-based_access_control|role-based access control]] (RBAC) system is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. You need an RBAC system if you want to restrict access to files, capabilities, resources, or sockets to ''all'' users, including [[w:Superuser|root]]. This is similar to a [[w:Mandatory Access Control|Mandatory Access Control]] (MAC) model. The other features of grsecurity are only effective at fending of attackers trying to gain root, so the RBAC system is used to fill in this gap. Least privilege can be granted to processes, which, in turn, forces attackers to reevaluate their methods of attack, since gaining access to the root account no longer means that they have full access to the system. Access can be explicitly granted to processes that need it, in such a way that root acts as any other user. Though grsecurity and its RBAC system are in no means perfect security, they greatly increase the difficulty of successfully compromising the system.

In grsecurity, the RBAC system is managed through a '''policy''' file which is essentially a system-wide set of rules. When the RBAC system is activated with &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt;, the policy file is parsed and checked for security holes, such as granting the default role access to certain sensitive devices and files like the policy file itself. If a security hole is found, &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; will refuse to enable the RBAC system, and will give the user a list of things that need to be fixed. The policy file is protected when the RBAC system is active, and only the admin role may access it during that time. To make it easier to create a secure policy, &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; has the ability to learn how the system functions, and build a least-privilege policy based on the collected data (see [[../The_Administration_Utility#Learning_Mode|Learning Mode]]).

== Limitations of Any Access Control System ==

So as not to contribute further to the false sense of security many have regarding access control systems (whether they be grsecurity's RBAC, [[w:Selinux|SELinux]], [[w:Rsbac|RSBAC]], [[w:Simplified_Mandatory_Access_Control_Kernel|SMACK]], [[w:TOMOYO_Linux|TOMOYO]], [[w:AppArmor|AppArmor]], etc.) it's important first to describe the limitations of any access control system.

There is a fundamental architectural limitation to the kind of guarantees an access control system can provide when the policy decision-making code resides alongside the Operating System's kernel.  A compromise of the Operating System can easily result in compromise of the access control system, and it is common practice for exploits which compromise the kernel to disable any active security systems.

Grsecurity is in no way immune to this fundamental limitation, though it does contain several features to help prevent exploitation of the kernel in the first place and furthermore to make the kernel a more hostile environment to an attacker if they do manage to exploit certain types of bugs.  The project will continue to make adding similar protections one of its main goals.

Specifically, the following features are involved in kernel self-protection and increasing the difficulty of kernel exploitation:
&lt;pre&gt;
GRKERNSEC_MODHARDEN
GRKERNSEC_HIDESYM
PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE
PAX_UDEREF
PAX_KERNEXEC
PAX_RANDKSTACK
PAX_USERCOPY
PAX_REFCOUNT
&lt;/pre&gt;

There also exist some features of grsecurity which are always active (and thus have no configure-time option) which aid in the above goals.  These include the read-only and non-executable vsyscall page (and its shadow page) on amd64, prevention of integer wraparound vulnerabilities from addition/multiplication done in allocator arguments, const-ifying hundreds of function table pointers, etc.

Though these features have been successful at preventing previous vulnerabilities from being exploited (and surely will continue to do so) there have still been many vulnerabilities it did nothing to prevent exploitation of, and there are entire classes of vulnerabilities (such as missing capability checks, some race conditions, etc.) that it can likely never do anything to prevent exploitation of.

It's partially due to this fundamental limitation of any access control system that grsecurity's RBAC system was designed as it was: to be as automated as possible, to provide a sufficient level of access control, to have easily editable human-readable configurations, and to enforce secure base policies to eliminate some administrator error.

Neither grsecurity's RBAC system nor any other access control system should be used to separate classified information from unclassified information on the same machine.  There is no virtual replacement for a physical air-gap.

== Policy Structure ==

The policy is made up of roles, subjects and objects. '''Role''' is an abstraction that encompasses traditional users and groups that exist in Linux distributions and special roles, that are specific to grsecurity. '''Subjects''' are processes or directories, and '''objects''' are ﬁles, capabilities, resources, PaX flags, and IP [[w:Access_control_list|ACL]]s. The location of the main policy ﬁle is ''/etc/grsec/policy''.

=== Policy Structure in a Nutshell ===

To see a small example policy, look at the default ''/etc/grsec/policy'' file that is installed with &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt;.  In a nutshell, RBAC policies have the following structure:

&lt;pre&gt;

 role &lt;role1&gt; &lt;rolemode&gt;
 &lt;role attributes&gt;
 subject / &lt;subject mode&gt;
 &lt;subject attributes&gt;
     / &lt;object mode&gt;
     &lt;extra objects&gt;
     &lt;capability rules&gt;
     &lt;IP ACLs&gt;
     &lt;resource restrictions&gt;
 subject &lt;extra subject&gt; &lt;subject mode&gt;
 &lt;subject attributes&gt;
     / &lt;object mode&gt;
     &lt;extra objects&gt;
     ...
 role &lt;role2&gt; &lt;rolemode&gt;
 ...

&lt;/pre&gt;

Using the default policy as an example:

&lt;pre&gt;

 role admin sA
 subject / rvka
        / rwcdmlxi

 role default G
 role_transitions admin
 subject /
        /               r
        /opt            rx
        /home           rwxcd
        /mnt            rw
        /dev
        /dev/grsec      h
 ...

&lt;/pre&gt;

== Rules for Policies ==

=== Policy generalization ===
There exist some features of the RBAC system to aid in simplification and generalization of policies.  One of these is the recently added &quot;replace&quot; rule.
The replace rule allows you to assign a string to a variable, and then use that variable within any subject or object pathname to have it replaced with the string.  The syntax of replace rules are:
&lt;pre&gt;
 replace &lt;variable name&gt; &lt;replace string&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

So for example:
&lt;pre&gt;
 replace CVSROOT /home/cvs
&lt;/pre&gt;

The defined variable can then be used as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
 replace CVSROOT /home/cvs
 replace PUBHTML public_html

 subject $(CVSROOT)/bin/test o
       $(CVSROOT)/grsecurity r
       /home/spender/$(PUBHTML) r
       ...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The variables defined with replace rules can be reassigned at any location in the policy.  All rules in the policy until another redefinition of the variable will use that new assigned value for the variable.  For example:
&lt;pre&gt;
 replace CVSROOT /home/cvs
 $(CVSROOT)/grsecurity r
 replace CVSROOT /var/cvs
 $(CVSROOT)/test r
&lt;/pre&gt;
would cause the following object rules to be created:
&lt;pre&gt;
 /home/cvs/grsecurity r
 /var/cvs/test r
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Special Cases ===
There are some special cases you should know about when writing policies for the RBAC system.

There exist some unique accesses to filesystem objects that require specific object modes.  For instance, a process that connects to a unix domain socket (''/dev/log'' for example) will need &quot;rw&quot; set as the object mode for that socket.

Adding the setgid or setuid flag to a path requires the &quot;m&quot; object mode.

Creating a hard-link requires at minimum a &quot;cl&quot; object mode.  The remaining object flags must match on the target and the source.
So for instance, if a process is creating a hard-link from /bin/bash to /bin/bash2, example rules would be:
&lt;pre&gt;
 /bin/bash rx
 /bin/bash2 rxcl
&lt;/pre&gt;

Creating a symlink requires the &quot;wc&quot; object mode.

=== Wildcarded Objects ===
One very useful feature of the RBAC system is the support of wildcards in objects. The &quot;*&quot; character matches zero or more characters, &quot;?&quot; matches exactly one character, and &quot;[]&quot; can be used to specify an inclusive or exclusive list or range of characters to match. Depending on how these wildcard characters are used, they have different effects. Here are four examples of the use of wildcards:
&lt;pre&gt;
/dev/tty*      rw
/home/*/bin    rwx
/dev/tty[0-9]  rw
/dev/tty?      rw
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first example would match ''/dev/ttya'', ''/dev/tty0'', ''/dev/ttyS0'', etc.  Since a '*' at the end of a path can match the '/' character as well, if a '/dev/tty/somefile' path existed, the first example would match it also.

The second example would match ''/home/user1/bin'', ''/home/user2/bin'', etc.  Note that this rule would not match the path ''/home/user1/test/bin'' as the wildcard characters will not match '/' unless it appears at the end of a path.  To use the particular wildcarded object for this example, a ''/home'' object must exist as an &quot;anchor&quot; for the wildcarded object.  If you forget to add one, '''gradm''' will remind you.

The third example would match ''/dev/tty0'', ''/dev/tty1'', ... , ''/dev/tty9'' and nothing else.

The fourth example would match ''/dev/ttya'' and ''/dev/tty0'' just like the first example, but would not match ''/dev/ttyS0'' since only one character can match the '?' wildcard.

Wildcards are evaluated at run-time, providing a powerful way of specifying and simplifying policy.  Since wildcard matching is based off pathnames and not inode/device pairs though, they aren't intended to be used for objects which are known to be hardlinked at policy enable time.

== Roles ==

Roles exist essentially as a container for a set of subjects, put to use in specific scenarios.  There exist user roles, group roles, a default role, and special roles.  See [[../The_RBAC_System#Flow_of_Matches|Flow of Matches]] to see how a role gets matched with a particular process.

=== User Roles ===
In a simplified form, user roles are roles that are automatically applied when a process either is executed by a user of a particular UID or the process changes to that particular UID.  In the RBAC system, the name of a user role must match up with the name of an actual user on the system.

A user role looks like:
&lt;pre&gt;
role user1 u
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Group Roles ===
As with user roles, group roles pertain to a particular GID.  The name of the group role must match up with the name of an actual group on the system.  Note that this is tied only to the GID of a process, not to any supplemental groups a process may have.  Group roles are applied for a given process only if a user role does not match the process' UID.

A group role looks like:
&lt;pre&gt;
role group1 g
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Default Role ===
If neither a user or group role match a given process, then it is assigned the default role.  The default role should ideally be a role with nearly no access to the system.  It is configured in such a way if full system learning is used.

A default role looks like:
&lt;pre&gt;
role default
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Special Roles ===
Special roles are to be used for granting extra privilege to normal user accounts.  Some example uses of special roles are to provide an &quot;admin&quot; role that can restart services and edit system configuration files.  Special roles can also be provided for regular users to keep their accounts more secure.  If they have their own ''public_html'' directory, the user role for the user could keep this directory read-only, while a special role to which the user is allowed to transition could allow modification of the files in the directory.

Special roles come in two flavors, ones that require authentication, and ones that do not.  On the side of special roles that require authentication, the RBAC system supports a flag that allows PAM authentication to be used for the special role.  See [[../Appendix/Role_Modes|Role Modes]] for a list of all these flags.

Special roles by themselves won't do anything unless there exist non-special (user, group, or default) roles that can transition to them.  This transitioning is defined by the '''role_transitions''' rule, described in the [[../Appendix/Role_Attributes|Role Attributes]] page.

To authenticate to a special role, use &lt;tt&gt;gradm -a &lt;rolename&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.
To authenticate with PAM to a special role, use &lt;tt&gt;gradm -p &lt;rolename&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.
To transition to a special role that requires no authentication, use &lt;tt&gt;gradm -n &lt;rolename&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

Special roles look like:
&lt;pre&gt;
role specialauth s

role specialnoauth sN

role specialpamauth sP
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Domains ==

With domains you can combine users that don't share a common group ID as well as groups so that they share a single policy. Domains work just like roles, with the only exception being that the line starting with &quot;role&quot; is replaced with one of the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
domain somedomainname u user1 user2 user3 user4 ... usern
domain somedomainname g group1 group2 group3 group4 ... groupn
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example:
&lt;pre&gt;
domain somedomain u daemon bin www-data
subject /
    /    h
&lt;/pre&gt;

As it is with user and group roles, all domain members must exist, and if they're not, and error is raised.
== Subjects ==

Subjects can describe directories, binaries or scripts.  Regular expressions are currently not permitted for subjects.  The ability to place a subject on a script is unique, as it permits one to grant privilege to a specific script instead of generally to the associated script's interpreter.  For this to function properly, make sure the script's interpreter directive does not use ''#!/usr/bin/env'' but rather the full path to the interpreter.

== Capability Restrictions ==

When no capability restriction rules are used for a given subject, all capabilities that the system grants normally to processes within that subject are allowed to be used.  An exception to this is if the subject involved uses policy inheritance.  In that case, the capability restrictions would come from the subject(s) being inherited from.  Capability rules have the form +CAP_NAME or -CAP_NAME.  CAP_ALL is a pseudo-capability meant to describe the entire list of capabilities.  It's mainly used to remove all capability usage for a subject, or in conjunction with a small number of rules granting the ability to use individual capabilities.  Provided below are some example scenarios of capability restriction usage, along with an explanation of how the policy is interpreted.

'''Scenario #1:'''  In this scenario, we're removing all capabilities from &lt;tt&gt;su&lt;/tt&gt; but CAP_SETUID and CAP_SETGID.
&lt;pre&gt;
  ...
  subject /bin/su o
    ...
    -CAP_ALL
    +CAP_SETUID
    +CAP_SETGID
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Scenario #2:'''  In this scenario, we're making use of policy inheritance.  Note that the default subject allows CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE and CAP_NET_RAW.  In our &lt;tt&gt;ping&lt;/tt&gt; subject, we're removing CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, but since we're inheriting from the default subject (note the lack of the ''o'' subject mode on the &lt;tt&gt;ping&lt;/tt&gt; subject), we are still allowed CAP_NET_RAW.  Granting important capabilities to default subjects is not something allowed by the RBAC system, so this is just an example.
&lt;pre&gt;
  ...
  subject /
    ...
    -CAP_ALL
    +CAP_NET_RAW
    +CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
  subject /bin/ping
    ...
    -CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Auditing and Suppression:'''  Auditing of attempted capability use and suppression of denied capability usage is possible as well.  Capability auditing and suppression supports the same policy inheritance rules as normal capability rules.  The below example demonstrates auditing the use of CAP_NET_RAW and the suppression of CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE denials:
&lt;pre&gt;
  ...
  subject /
    ...
    -CAP_ALL
    -CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE suppress
    +CAP_NET_RAW audit
&lt;/pre&gt;

For a full listing of the capabilities available, see: [[../Appendix/Capability_Names_and_Descriptions|Capability Names and Descriptions]].  Note that not all of the capabilities listed may be supported by your particular version of the Linux kernel.

== Resource Restrictions ==

One of the features of grsecurity's ACL system is process–based resource restrictions. Using this feature allows you to restrict things like how much memory a process can take up, how much CPU time, how many ﬁles it can open, and how many processes it can execute. Also in this section, we will discuss a &quot;fake&quot; resource implemented in grsecurity's ACL system called &quot;RES_CRASH&quot; that helps guard against bruteforce exploit attempts, which is necessary if you're using PaX.

A single resource rule follows the following syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;resource name&gt; &lt;soft limit&gt; &lt;hard limit&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

An example of this syntax would be:
&lt;pre&gt;
RES_NOFILE 3 3
&lt;/pre&gt;

This would allow the process to open a maximum of 3 ﬁles (all processes have 3 open ﬁle descriptors at some point: stdin (standard input), stdout (standard output), and stderr (standard error output)).

To clarify what the soft limit and hard limit are, the soft limit is the limit assigned to the process when it is run. The hard limit is the maximum point to which a process can raise the limit via &lt;tt&gt;setrlimit(2)&lt;/tt&gt;, unless they have CAP_SYS_RESOURCE. In the case of RES_CPU, when the soft limit is overstepped, a special signal is sent to the process continuously. When the hard limit is overstepped, the process is killed. 

A person who is less familiar with Linux should stick to setting limits on the number of ﬁles, the address space limit, and number of processes. Of course, you can always use the [[../The_Administration_Utility#Learning_Mode|learning mode]] of grsecurity to set the resource limits for you. The RES_CPU resource is the only one that accepts time as limits. The time defaults to units of milliseconds. You can also append a case sensitive unit to your limit.

Some examples would be:
* 100s – 100 seconds
* 25m – 25 minutes
* 65h – 65 hours
* 2d – 2 days

The other resources either operate on a number itself or on a size, in bytes. For these you can use the following units: K, M, and G, like:
* 2G – 2 billion
* 25M – 25 million
* 100K – 100 thousand

If you don't want any restriction for the soft or hard limit for a resource, you can use &quot;unlimited&quot; as the limit. Here are some more examples to help you understand how this works:
&lt;pre&gt;
subject /bin/bash
       /               r
       /opt            rx
       /home           rwxcd
       /mnt            rw
       /dev
       /dev/grsec      h

       RES_CPU 25m 30m
       RLIMIT_AS 5M 5M
       RLIMIT_NPROC 2 2
       RLIMIT_FSIZE 5K 10K
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

For a list of accepted resource names and units, see [[../Appendix/System_Resources|System Resources]]. 

=== RES_CRASH ===

This &quot;fake&quot; resource limit is expressed by using the name &quot;RES_CRASH&quot; and has the following syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;
RES_CRASH &lt;number of crashes&gt; &lt;amt. of time&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

For example, if you wanted to allow the program to crash once every 30 minutes, you would use the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
RES_CRASH 1 30m
&lt;/pre&gt;
What happens when this threshold is reached? Well, the only way to ensure that the process won't crash again is to keep it from being executed. If the process is a suid/sgid binary run by a regular user, we kill all processes of that regular user and keep them from logging in for the amount of time, speciﬁed as the second parameter to the RES_CRASH resource. So for the above example, the user would be locked out of the system for 30 minutes. If the process is not a suid/sguid binary, we simply keep the binary from being run again for the amount of time speciﬁed as the second parameter to the RES_CRASH resource, after killing all processes of that binary.

== Socket Policies ==
The RBAC system supports policies on what local IP addresses and ports can be reserved on the machine, as well as what remote hosts and ports can be communicated with.  These two different accesses are abstracted to ''bind'' and ''connect'' rules, respectively.  The syntax for the rules is:
&lt;pre&gt;
  connect &lt;IP/host&gt;/&lt;netmask&gt;:&lt;port/portrange&gt; &lt;socket type 1&gt; ... &lt;socket type n&gt; &lt;proto 1&gt; ... &lt;proto n&gt;
  bind &lt;IP/host&gt;/&lt;netmask&gt;:&lt;port/portrange&gt; &lt;socket type 1&gt; ... &lt;socket type n&gt; &lt;proto 1&gt; ... &lt;proto n&gt;

  or:

  connect disabled
  bind disabled
&lt;/pre&gt;
&quot;proto&quot; can be any of the protocol names listed in ''/etc/protocol'' or &quot;any_proto&quot; to denote any protocol.
&quot;socket type&quot; is most commonly &quot;ip&quot;, &quot;dgram&quot;, or &quot;stream&quot;, but can also be &quot;raw_sock&quot;, &quot;rdm&quot;, or &quot;any_sock&quot; to denote any socket type.
Most of the parameters for these rules are optional, particularly the netmask and port or port range.  If a port is supplied, then at least an IP address of 0.0.0.0/0 needs to be supplied.

As with capability restrictions, resource restrictions, and many other RBAC features, if the socket policies are omitted for a given subject, then the subject is allowed to bind or connect to anything normally allowed by the system.  Note though that if a connect rule is given, then at least one bind rule must also be specified.  Older versions of &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; (before the 9/16/09 2.1.14 release) will treat the unspecified rule as a &quot;disabled&quot; rule, whereas new versions will generate an error on such policies.

{{XWarning|Unlike with file objects and capabilities, policy inheritance has not been implemented for socket policies.  Therefore, the socket policies for a given subject are solely determined by that subject alone.}}

Here are some example rules:
&lt;pre&gt;
  subject /usr/bin/ssh o
  ...
  connect 192.168.0.0/24:22 stream tcp
  connect ourdnsserver.com:53 dgram udp
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example, &lt;tt&gt;ssh&lt;/tt&gt; is allowed to connect to ssh servers anywhere on the class C 192.168.0.X network.  It is also allowed to do DNS lookups through the host specified.  The hostname is resolved at the time the RBAC system is enabled.

&lt;pre&gt;
  subject /usr/bin/nc o
  ...
  bind 0.0.0.0/0:1024-65535 stream tcp
  connect 22.22.22.22:5190 stream tcp
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example, &lt;tt&gt;netcat&lt;/tt&gt; is allowed to listen on ports 1024 through 65535 on any local interface for TCP connections.  It is also able to connect to TCP port 5190 of the 22.22.22.22 host.

&lt;pre&gt;
  subject /bin/strange o
  ...
  bind disabled
  connect 192.168.1.5:6000-6006 stream tcp
&lt;/pre&gt;
This example illustrates how you can have bind disabled but still specify connect rules, or conversely, have connect disabled and only specify bind rules.

As you can see from the examples above, you can have as many socket policies as you wish for a given subject, and as you'll read below there are some powerful extensions to the socket policies.

=== Per-interface Socket Policies ===
Rules such as:
&lt;pre&gt;
bind eth1:80 stream tcp
bind eth0#1:22 stream tcp
&lt;/pre&gt;
are allowed, giving you the ability to tie specific socket rules to a single interface (or by using the inverted rules mentioned below, all but one interface).  Virtual interfaces are specified by the &lt;ifname&gt;#&lt;vindex&gt; syntax.  If an interface is specified, no IP/netmask or host may be specified for the rule.

=== Inverted Socket Policies ===
Rules such as:
&lt;pre&gt;
connect ! www.google.com:80 stream tcp
&lt;/pre&gt;
are allowed, which allows you to specify that a process can connect to anything except to port 80 of www.google.com with a stream TCP socket.  The inverted socket matching also works on bind rules.

== PaX Flags ==

In more recent versions of the RBAC system, PaX flags have been changed from single-letter subject modes to more closely resemble how capabilities are handled within the policy.  Therefore, PaX flags can now be fully controlled on or off for any given subject by adding +PAX_&lt;feature&gt; or -PAX_&lt;feature&gt; within the scope of a subject.  For a full listing of the PaX flags available, see: [[../Appendix/PaX_Flags|PaX Flags]].

== Flow of Matches ==

Each process on the system has a role and a subject attached to it.  This section describes how a process is matched to a role and subject, and how matches are calculated against the objects and capabilities they use.  Understanding the flow of matches is necessary for manually creating policies.

=== Role Hierarchy ===

When determining a role for a process, the RBAC system matches based on the following role hierarchy, from most specific to least specific:
&lt;pre&gt;
 user -&gt; group -&gt; default
&lt;/pre&gt;
Both user and group roles are permitted to have the &lt;tt&gt;role_allow_ip&lt;/tt&gt; attributes.  When checking the UID or GID against the user or group role, respectively, the &lt;tt&gt;role_allow_ip&lt;/tt&gt; attributes come into play.  Imagine the following policy:
&lt;pre&gt;
role user1 u
role_allow_ip 192.168.1.5
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
If someone attempted to log in to the machine as user1 from any IP address other than 192.168.1.5, they would not be assigned the user1 role.  The matching system would then fall back on trying to find an acceptable group role, or if one could not be found, fall back to the default role.

=== Subject/Object Hierarchy ===

Hierarchy for subjects and objects involves matching a most specific pathname over a less specific pathname.  So, if a ''/bin'' object exists, and a ''/bin/ping'' object exists, and a process is attempting to read ''/bin/ping'', the ''/bin/ping'' object would be the one matching.  If ''/bin/su'' were being accessed instead, then ''/bin'' would match.

The path from most specific to least specific pathname isn't linear however, particularly in the case of subjects using policy inheritance.  Imagine the following policy:
&lt;pre&gt;
role user1 u
  subject /
    / r
    /tmp rwcd
    /usr/bin rx
    /root r
    /root/test/blah r
    ...
  subject /usr/bin/specialbin
    /root/test rw
    ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
If ''/root/test/blah'' was being accessed by ''/usr/bin/specialbin'', it would not be able to write to it.  The reason for this is that when going from most specific to least specific for a given path (which involves stripping off each trailing path component and attempting a match for the resulting pathname), the matching algorithm will look (in order from most specific to least specific) in each of the subjects the current subject inherits from.  In this case, the algorithm saw that no object existed for ''/root/test/blah'' in the ''/usr/bin/specialbin'' subject, so upon checking the subject for ''/'' it found a ''/root/test/blah'' object, thus resulting in the read-only permission.

When going from most specific to least specific, a globbed object such as ''/home/*'' is treated as less specific than ''/home/blah'' (if the requested access is for ''/home/blah'').  Globbed objects are matched in the order in which they're listed in the RBAC policy.  So in the following example:
&lt;pre&gt;
role user1 u
  subject /
     / r
     /home r
     /home/* r
     /home/test* rw
     ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
If a process were accessing ''/home/testing/somefile'' it would only be allowed to read it, since the ''/home/*'' rule was listed first.  It was likely that the policy writer didn't intend this behavior (because the ''/home/test*'' rule would never match) so the ''/home/test*'' object should be swapped to the line the ''/home/*'' object is on.

=== Capability Hierarchy ===
When determining whether a capability is granted or not, the RBAC system works from most specific subject to least specific (in the case of policy inheritance).  The first subject along that path that mentions the capability in question is the one that matches.  To illustrate:
&lt;pre&gt;
role user1 u
  subject /
    ...
    -CAP_ALL
    +CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
  subject /bin
    ...
    -CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
  subject /bin/su
    ...
    +CAP_SETUID
    +CAP_SETGID
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example, ''/bin/su'' is able to use only CAP_SETUID and CAP_SETGID.  A lookup on CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE would fall back to the ''/bin'' subject, since ''/bin/su'' inherits from it and did not explicitly list a rule for CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE.  The ''/bin'' subject specifies that CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE be disallowed.  Matching against another capability, CAP_SYS_ADMIN for instance, would end up falling back to the ''/'' subject, where it would match -CAP_ALL and be denied.

== Policy Recommendations ==

Try to remove as many capabilities from default subjects as possible. The more you remove, the closer root comes to acting as a regular user. The more capabilities you remove, however, the more subjects you will have to create for programs that need those capabilities.  The RBAC system will enforce that a minimum level of capabilities be removed from all default subjects.

Use full system learning. It will generate a better policy than you would have generated by hand.  Make sure you're making full use of the ''/etc/grsec/learn_config'' file to specify the files and directories particular to your system that you want protected.  &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; will do all the heavy lifting of creating privilege boundaries for processes that access or modify important data.

Administrative programs, such as shutdown or reboot, should require authentication instead of giving everyone the capabilities to run them.

Always inspect your kernel logs.  The RBAC system provides a great amount of human-readable information in every kernel log.  Of particular importance is what role and subject were assigned to the process causing an alert.  If you think that the alert doesn't match up with what you expect from your policy, make sure that the role and subject actually match.  If they don't, then you may have issues with a ''role_allow_ip'' rule that's preventing the proper role from being applied.

Familiarize yourself with Linux’s capabilities and what they cover.  A full listing of them is available here: 
[[../Appendix/Capability_Names_and_Descriptions|Capability Names and Descriptions]].

Avoid using policy inheritance until you understand fully how it forms the policy for a given subject.  Even then, use it sparingly, reserving it generally for cases where a default subject is configured least privilege, with no readable/writable/executable objects and no capabilities.

Wherever possible, avoid granting both write and execute permission to objects.  This gives a potential attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code.  Similar to how PaX prevents arbitrary code execution within a given process' address space, one of your goals in creating policies is to prevent this on the file system as well.

Be careful using the suppression ('s') object flag, especially when applying it to / to ignore accesses a program does not really need to operate correctly.  A change in glibc or another library the subject uses could cause the application to fail in a way that will be difficult to debug (unless your first step is to remove the suppression flag).

== Sample Policies ==

Below is the sample policy provided with a &lt;tt&gt;gradm&lt;/tt&gt; installation:

&lt;pre&gt;

Below is a full user role policy that covers the behavior of &lt;tt&gt;cvs-pserver&lt;/tt&gt; when run as the non-root cvs user, providing anonymous read-only CVS repository access.
&lt;pre&gt;
role cvs u
   subject /
      /     h
      -CAP_ALL
      connect   disabled
      bind      disabled

   subject /usr/bin/cvs
      /
      /etc/fstab         r
      /etc/mtab          r
      /etc/passwd        r
      /proc/meminfo      r
      /dev/urandom       r
      /dev/log           rw
      /dev/null          rw
      /home/cvs          r
      /home/cvs/CVSROOT/val-tags  rw
      /home/cvs/CVSROOT/history   ra
      /tmp               rwcd

      /var/run/.nscd_socket       rw
      /proc/sys/kernel   r
      /var/run
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's all that's needed for an unprivileged sshd account:
&lt;pre&gt;
role sshd u
   subject /
      /  h
      /var/run/sshd r
      -CAP_ALL
      bind disabled
      connect disabled
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <comment>Explained the decision to use a custom EBNF variant.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== About the Policy Structure ==

As stated on the page, the policy structure/syntax is described using a custom variant of [[w:Extended_Backus–Naur_Form|EBNF]]. At first I wrote it in [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-14977-paper.pdf ISO EBNF] (PDF warning), because I wanted to use an actual standard, but I came to the conclusion that it's very hard to comprehend, especially if you've never seen EBNF descriptions before. This is why I got rid of the curly braces, concatenation with commas and introduced quantifiers. In my opinion this variant is easier to comprehend than ISO EBNF.

Is there anyhing to be said against to take up also the ARTICLESPACE &quot;user&quot;? If not, the [[Template:ROOTBOOKNAME2]] would not be needed by the Template &quot;toto&quot;. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 11:48, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
:I've added this to the template for you. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:14, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
::Thank you!
::But sorry, I found another: &quot;Transwiki&quot;. From [[Transwiki:Bypassing the Great Firewall of China]]. I guess, soon it will  be merged into [[Bypassing Internet Censorship]]. I thought about &quot;Wikijunior&quot;, but it seem to be not helpful, because it makes sense to know, that this is a &quot;Wikijunior-Book&quot;. --[[User:Mjchael|Mjchael]] ([[User talk:Mjchael|talk]]) 12:39, 15 August 2009 (UTC)

The new behavior of {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} on userspace &amp;mdash; and its old behavior on userspace as well &amp;mdash; strike me as '''inconsistent with the purpose''' of {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}}.  (We'd never really given a long hard look to the behavior of {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} on namespaces other than main, Wikijunior, template, and category &amp;mdash; until now this has pushed me into really focusing on it.)  Software tools should have a single clear purpose and do that one thing really well; in my experience, trying to shoehorn multiple, partly disparate purposes into a single tool never ends well.

The purpose of {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} is to extract, from the current page name, the name of the book with which the current page is ''administratively'' associated, even if that associated book is in a different namespace.  For categories and templates, that means stripping off the namespace prefix, so for example [[Template:Wikijunior:Solar System/Coolfacts]] is associated with book [[Wikijunior:Solar System]].  For pages that are actually parts of books, the namespace prefix is kept, so for example [[Wikijunior:Languages/Klingon]] is associated with book [[Wikijunior:Languages]].  Thus {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} partitions (non-talk) namespaces into those that are part of book names, and those that aren't.  The ones that aren't are considered to be special administrative namespaces, and therefore exceptions to the rule (which is why the default is to &lt;s&gt;strip off&lt;/s&gt; keep the namespace prefix).  Heuristically, the exceptional, administrative namespaces are recognized by two characteristics:  they don't host books, and it is possible to imagine a page in that namespace having a name that associates it with a book in any of several other namespaces.

What about userspace?  I'm willing to stipulate that no book would ever be hosted in userspace.  However, if a page associated with, say, {{nowrap|[[Wikijunior:Solar System]]}} were located in userspace, its name would ''not'' start with&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;User:Wikijunior:Solar System&lt;/code&gt;}}, but rather with&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;User:&lt;/code&gt;''name''&lt;code&gt;/Wikijunior:Solar System&lt;/code&gt;}}.  For example, if {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} were called from anywhere on a page&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;User:Pi zero/Wikijunior:Solar System/Print version&lt;/code&gt;}}, it should produce&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Wikijunior:Solar System&lt;/code&gt;}}.  That's {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}}'s reason for existing.

If that behavior would actually be reasonable for the way {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} is being used in {{tlx|Todo}}, then that's well and good.  If that behavior ''isn't'' reasonable for the way {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}} is being used in {{tlx|Todo}}, then, on sober reflection, {{tlx|Todo}} shouldn't be using {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}}.

BTW, it seems reasonable to me to treat&amp;nbsp; &lt;code&gt;Transwiki:&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; as a purely administrative prefix, to be stripped off by {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}}, because pretty clearly transwiki-space would never host a book (though it probably also wouldn't contain a page whose name adminstratively associated it with a book in another space).

Now that this has come up, I'm thinking sometime soon I should draft a proposed upgrade for {{tlx|ROOTBOOKNAME}}, encompassing both its behavior and its documentation.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:55, 15 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Ingredients ==
*1 1/4 pounds skinless wild salmon filet, cut into 2-inch cubes
*Panko breadcrumbs
*1 tsp salt
*1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
*Juice of one lemon
*1 tbs grated lemon zest
*8 ounces olive oil
*Melted butter

== Procedure ==
#Run salmon through a meat grinder on medium setting. If you don't have one of these, ask your butcher to, but ask for it to be clean before he does.
#Combine ground salmon, 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, salt and pepper, and lemon. Form into 4 patties, about 1 1/4 inch thick.
#Insert a probe thermometer into one of the cakes. Place on a greased baking pan and bake at 350 degrees F until internal temperature reaches 130 degrees F.
#While the salmon cooks, heat olive oil in a cast iron skillet to 375 degrees F. Once salmon is parcooked, dredge into more breadcrumbs then immediately transfer to oil. Cook until golden brown on both sides.
#Serve immediately with melted butter.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is meant to be a comprehensive collection of exercises for all areas generally found in undergraduate physics.  Often times textbooks offer few exercises and only give solutions to even or odd numbered problems.  This book will offer problems both for applied situations and those of a theoretical nature.  

Following organization will be followed in the book:
* The prerequisite mathematics and physics with be listed above each set of problems in a given category.  For example if the category is Classical Mechanics there will be a set of problems for those with no calculus background, under that there will be a group of problems for people with a calculus background, under that there will be some that require an understanding of ODE, and so on.  
* Difficult questions will be marked by a fixed notation (tentatively, '''D''' preceding the question). 
* The solutions to all problems will be given with complete details, in a separate page (see: [[/Kinematics in One Dimension/]]) so that the student will have a chance to work out the problem before glancing the solution.
* The categories will include these and others: Classical Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, Relativity, Optics, Thermodynamics, Quantum Mechanics, Nuclear and Particle Physics, Fluids, and Statistical Mechanics.  
* At the end of the book there will be a list of constants, greek letters, and mathematical tables (trig, derivatives, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Argentina =

&lt;font size=3&gt;The first postage meter was placed into use in 1926. All stamps contain “REPUBLICA ARGENTINA” in the frank. Instead of a meter number they contain a permit number. The permit number usually has prefix “PERMISO” or “PERM.” with “No.” or “N” and sometimes occurs without prefix.
The stamps are grouped according to appearance and function as follows:
: '''A''' - Upright oval
: '''B''' - Small upright rectangle with simulated perforation border, value in lower left corner with emanating rays
: '''C''' - Wide rectangle with pillars at sides

: &lt;font size=3&gt;Stamps of sub-group PO-B often have a directional slug appearing some distance below the frank or TM. Examples are:
:: CERTIFICADA CERT. EXPRESO ENDA 
:: CERT. AEREA CERT. EXPR. AEREA
: These machines give receipts that resemble the stamps without the frank frame and with “RECIBO” below the value figures.
: Between 1981 and 1983 several post offices applied rubber stamps to Type PO-B franked covers to indicate that the postage value is ten times greater than what the meter stamp showed. This was due to inflation outpacing the capabilities of the machines.

'''by Ovwiki'''

Along the footpath, there lay an orphan with dusty old brown clothes, some old food and a few dollars and cents that was in his bag, gleaming in the dark night sky. I had nothing to do but see the orphan laying down on the footpath. I grabbed some money from my pocket, unzipped his bag, and put ten dollars in, and that was enough money he needed to have. I just didn't have feelings for myself. I had feelings for other people, people in need. A slight smile spread from the orphan's face. I glared at him angrily.
&quot;Give me back my money!&quot; I demanded. He just smiled more wickedly. &quot;Give me back my money!!&quot; I demanded again, going furious and red in the face.
&quot;Why should I? You're the one who fell for the trick! Every time I see someone, that happens! Oh, honestly, that's the best trick I've played on anybody. Firstly, you're not telling anyone. I'll hold you hostage until the day you escape,&quot; the trickest laughed uncontrollably.
Oh no, I thought. He was going to hold me hostage until the day I ''escape''?
This trickster, pretended he had no home, but the reason he did that is to get richer by forcing people to give him money. Well, here I am, held hostage, until I find a way to escape. Did he mean that he wouldn't attempt to stop me from escaping? Crazy thoughts lurked into my mind. I felt dizzy, and wanted to go home.
I felt like I was drunk, and just arrived from a party. I felt like puking all over him, for a good, proper payback. I just felt like going home. I stood up, walked away, but cold, icy hands stopped me from going anywhere. 
&quot;You're not going anywhere,&quot; the trickster said. &quot;Nothing will stop me from stopping you escape.&quot;
So, he was attempting to stop me from escaping. A trickster's job would be easy, just tricking people and pulling pranks causing mayhem. I was trapped. Nowhere to go. I wondered what I would be doing in the future, thanks to the trickester.

The '''Goddard Broadside''' was the second printed version of the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] to be distributed by the Second Continental Congress and the first to include the names of the signatories.

==History==
Contrary to popular belief, the Declaration of Independence was not &quot;signed&quot; on July 4, 1776. That was instead the date that the final draft of the Declaration was approved by the states represented in the Second Continental Congress (except New York) and sent to printer John Dunlap for typesetting and printing. The earliest published copies of Declaration, which were sent to the states, British authorities, and others, were these printed [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Dunlap broadside|Dunlap broadside]]s. 

After the Declaration was approved by New York, an &quot;engrossed copy&quot; was prepared on parchment by a calligrapher and signed by the delegates on and after August 2, 1776. This engrossed copy is the famous version of the Declaration now on display in the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].

In January 1777, Congress decided the Declaration should be more widely distributed. Printer Mary Katherine Goddard was commissioned to print a version containing the text and names of the signatories. Today, these copies are known as the &quot;Goddard Broadsides&quot;. Nine copies are known to still exist.

One of the eventual signers of the Declaration, Thomas McKean, is not listed on the Goddard Broadside, suggesting that he signed the engrossed copy after January 1777.

}}

After studying the subject, we are ready to tackle modeling it. Start up Blender.

==Start with a Primitive==

For this project we would use a cube. The cube already has several face loop we need and none of that we don't, so this primitive is a good starting point.

Opening Blender, we are already supplied with the default cube which is handy. If you don't have the default cube because you change the setting or remove it, simply add a new cube. Name this primitive something sensible like &quot;Swan Chair&quot; because it would become our chair later. Move the cube or adjust the background image until the cube is centered at our image. After doing that we proceed shaping our cube to create the basic form of our chair.

==Rough it out==

Since we are modeling a symmetrical object, lets take advantage of it and use the mirror modifier. Cut the cube in the front exactly in half by using loop cut at center (Shift + RKey -&gt; middle click, or Ctrl + RKey  -&gt; middle click on this editor's computer). For those with no middle buttons you could use subdivide. Select the vertical edges (go to edge select mode first, Ctrl + Tab -&gt; 2)  then use subdivide tool (WKey -&gt; 1). Remove the left half by deleting the vertices. Then add a mirror modifier in the modifier stack. This is available at the edit buttons, select the modifiers tab the click the &quot;Add Modifier&quot; button and select &quot;Mirror&quot; from the selection. Activate &quot;do clipping&quot; from the mirror modifier panel that appeared to prevent accidental  movement of the central vertices.

(Noob Note: If you follow these instructions, you'll have a gap between the mesh and its mirror. I fixed this by increasing the &quot;Merge Limit&quot; option in the Mirror modifier menu to .1.)

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialAddingMirrorModifier.png|588px]]|2=The cube primitive with mirror modifier on}}

Move the vertices so that it would follow the shape of the bottom of the chair image.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair1.png|635px]]|2=Shaping the bottom}}


Note that the reference images used does not match very well. This is because of perspective and camera angle distortion. In this case use the side image sice it shows less distortion. Use the front reference image as an eyeballing guide for the front side of the chair. An oblique reference as stated earlier in planning stages is helpful to guide you in this condition.

Add an edgeloop using the loop cut tool (Shift+RKey) as shown in the image bellow. Move the newly created vertices to follow the references

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair2.png|626px]]|2=Shaping the bottom}}

Its is good practice that while modeling you had to view your model at various views not only the standard front, side and top views. Remember that you are modeling a 3d object. What looks good in this some views are not necessarily good in other views. This would result in complications like the familiar flat face look in face models. Moving your view around would help you prevent this. Shown bellow is the view of the model at an oblique view.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:Chairtutorial1.4.png|499px]]|2=Shaping the bottom oblique view}}

Now extrude the back part of the model to form the back part of the chair. Adjust the newly formed vertices to follow your guide images as shown bellow.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair4.png|647px]]|2=Shaping the back}}

Its a good practice to see the model at various views while modeling here is how it look like now at an oblique view:

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:File-BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair5.png|468px]]|2=Shaping the back oblique view}}

Select the following faces. We are going to extrude it to form the sides for the chair.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair7.png|669px]]|2=Shaping the sides, faces to select}}

Extrude the faces and adjust newly formed vertices to conform with the guide images.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair8.png|774px]]|2=Shaping the sides}}

And now the oblique view.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair9.png|503px]]|2=Shaping the sides, oblique view}}

The back still does not look good so add the following edge loop.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair10.png|756px]]|2=Shaping the back again}}

Adjust it.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair11.png|756px]]|2=Shaping the back again}}

Remember to rotate your view to see problem areas.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair12.png|465px]]|2=Shaping the back again, oblique view}}

Add this edge loop too.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair13.png|804px]]|2=Shaping the back again}}

Adjust.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair14.png|765px]]|2=Shaping the back again}}

And keeping with our good practice.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairtutorialShapingChair15.png|498px]]|2=Shaping the back again, oblique view}}

Say, the form is finished. The loops are all in place and the form is easily identified as a rough model of the Swan chair.

==Adding More Details==

Now the basic form of the model is finished and with all important loops in place detailing this model is easy. Lets start by defining the back. Add these edge loops.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing1.png|842px]]|2=Add these loop}}

Move the newly created vertices to fit the references.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing2.png|784px]]|2=Adjust the form}}

Be sure that the model looks right at various angles. The references images collected earlier will help. Adjust vertices if necessary.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing3.png|481px]]|2=Our model}}

The sides need to be taken care of too so add these edge loops.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing4.png|772px]]|2=Add these loops}}

Then adjust the vertices.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing5.png|768px]]|2=Refine}}

This is how the model now looks like.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing6.png|481px]]|2=Our model}}

Continue by adding these loops.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing7.png|811px]]|2=Add these loops}}

And adjust as usual.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing8.png|772px]]|2=Tweak}}

Check that it looks good at other views too. Move vertices as necessary.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing9.png|468px]]|2=Our model}}

Keep repeating this procedure. Add loops then adjust. Here is the loops that was added to the model. Tweaked after adding each.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing10.png|749px]]|2=More loops}}

The outline of the chair needs rounding up. Add these loops and tweak so it looks like the one shown.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing11.png|1079px]]|2=Rounding loops}}

This is now how the mode looks like.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing12.png|496px]]|2=Our model}}

Its rather tedious to add more loops at this time so lets do a cheat. Select all vertices (press AKey a few times) and then subdivide (WKey -&gt; 1Key) to add more vertices.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing13.png|740px]]|2=Subdivide the whole mesh}}

The model looks blocky so lets smooth it out. While the whole chair is still selected smooth the vertices by clicking Smooth a few times (Edit buttons -&gt;Mesh tools -&gt; Smooth; also available at WKey-&gt;Smooth). It would smooth out the model.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing14.png|738px]]|2=Smoothing the model}}

Admire the work (and tweak if necessary).

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing15.png|489px]]|2=Our model}}

This is optional. Add this loop and scale along normal (Alt + Skey) to scale it in. Adjust vertices if necessary.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairDetailing16.png|1203px]]|2=Modeling the seams}}

|previous=Model a Chair-The Seat
}}

Now the seat is finished, time for the legs for it to stand on.
==Starting Primitive==

The leg is mainly made up of cylinders so a cylinder is a very good primitive to start. In object mode add a cylinder with 16 vertices.Center the cylinder on the upper part of the telescope.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg1.png|778px]]|2=Adding the cylinder primitive}}

Tip: to make the cylinder centered relative to the seats center, while in object mode select the seat then hit Shift+Skey (Snap options) then select Cursor-&gt;Selection. The 3d cursor would be moved to the center of our seat. Now when you add the cylinder, the cylinders center would be located at the cursor which is also at the seats center. Now all you have to do is to move the cylinder along the y and z axis because it would be properly located relative to the x axis.

Hide or move the Seat to another layer so that it would not intrude while modeling the leg.

==The Upper Telescope==

Go to edit mode and scale the cylinder until its radius match the radius of the upper telescopic element of the chair's leg. Then move the top and bottom vertices to match the reference.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg2.png|778px]]|2=Modifying the primitive to fit refernce}}

Extrude the bottom part and place it a little lower. Extrude again and right click so that the newly created vertices would remain in their position. Scale the vertices a little. Extrude again and move the extruded region up the cylinder.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg3.png|426px]]|2=Shaping the bottom of the telescope}}

Remove the top and bottom vertices that cap the ends.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg4.png|349px]]|2=Opening ends}}

We will be using subsurf modifier to make this part smother. Add this loop to constrain the smoothing on this area.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg4.5.png|579px]]|2=Adding control loop}}

==The Lower Telescope==


Now lets start with the lower part. Add a cylinder in object mode and adjust the newly created vertices to match the reference.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg5.png|328px]]|2=Start modeling the lower telescopic part}}

The legs would be extruded from this cylinder. Add this loop to prepare.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg6.png|328px]]|2=Add this loop to enable extrusion of legs}}

Select the faces between the newly added loop and the bottom loop. Extrude this faces but right click after extrusion so the extruded faces remain in their position. Now scale them constrained along the xy-plane (Skey-&gt;Shift+Zkey) a little. This is how it should now look.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg7.png|309px]]|2=Forming the base}}

In top view select the two topmost faces and extrude to form the back leg. Shape the tip according based on the reference. Here is the steps taken to shape the tip. First after extruding, Constrained scale the tip along the x-axis (SKey-&gt;XKey) to make the tip thiner. Then move the tip lower. Deselect all, then select the top vertices of the tip and lower this vertices further.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg8.png|775px]]|2=Extruding a leg}}

Shape the base as shown bellow. This is done by selecting the vertices where the leg connects to the base then constrained scaling it along the y-axis to zero (Skey-&gt;YKey-&gt;0key). Then move the scaled vertices further back.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg9.png|363px]]|2=Shaping the leg}}


Then add an edge loop as shown bellow. constrained scale the newly created edgeloop along the x-axis to make it thiner.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg10.png|319px]]|2=Shaping the leg}}

We will be using the subsurf modifier to smooth our model so lets add the following edge loops so that the model will smooth properly. Add an edgeloop at the tip.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg11.png|744px]]|2=Adding control loop}}

And this loops on the side.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg12.png|672px]]|2=Adding control loops}}

Also remove the vertex that cap the top because we will not be needing it and it would cause smoothing artifact when subsurfed.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg13.png|665px]]|2=Shaping the leg}}

Now how about the other legs? We will be using Spin duplicate tool to make those. In top view select the central vertex then snap our 3d cursor to it.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg14.png|456px]]|2=Relocate 3d cursor to the center of the base}}

Now remove the other part of the cylinder as shown. We would be left with a quarter part of the whole leg assembly.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg15.png|282px]]|2=Delete extra vertices}}

Select all the vertices that are left. Change the parameters of the spin tool to this: degrees to 360, steps to 4. Click on the &quot;Spin Dup&quot;. If you have multiple 3d views, your mouse cursor would turn into a question mark. Move your cursor to the top view and then click. The other legs would appear as shown bellow. This legs are made of separate mesh and the original leg have a duplicate at exactly the same position creating double vertices. Connect the mesh and remove the doubles by selecting the whole mesh then remove the doubles (Wkey-&gt;Remove Doubles).

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg16.png|366px]]|2=Spin duplicating other legs}}


==The Stops==

Now lets create the Black Stops on every tip of the leg. We would be creating this joined to the legs as one object then separate it later. Its just that it seems more easy that way.

Without leaving edit mode, add a cube. scale an move it to one of the tip. Move the cube so that it would be lower that usual to separate it from the other mesh making it easier to edit it without disturbing the others.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg17.png|600px]]|2=Primitive for the stops}}


Shape the cube to match the tip. This should be easy by now. The whole step is left out.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg18.png|600px]]|2=Shape the primitive}}

Subsurf would be used to this too so add extra loops to control how the mesh would be smooth.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg19.png|600px]]|2=Stop with control loops added}}

Now make copies of the stops using the Spin Duplicate tool. Don't forget to remove the doubles.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg20.png|600px]]|2=Creating the whole stops with Spin duplicate tool}}

Select all the tips then move them together up until they intersect with the tips of the legs.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg21.png|600px]]|2=Positioning stops}}

Now lets separate separate meshes to individual objects. Press Pkey and select &quot;all loose part&quot; option.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg22.png|600px]]|2=Separating the Stops}}

Notice that the other part of the mesh would suddenly change in appearance. Don't worry. It just means that those meshes are now separate objects by them selves. If you go to object view you would now be able to select the leg and the tips as separate objects.

There are some issues though when you use the subsurf modifier on the leg base as shown.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg23.png|600px]]|2=Unwanted smoothing effect}}

Select the leg and go to edit mode. Add the following edge loop.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg24.png|579px]]|2=Adding control loop}}

Scale the base loop too as shown.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg25.png|567px]]|2=Scale lower loop}}

The issue should now be solved.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg26.png|558px]]|2=Much better}}

This is how the whole leg assembly should look. All have subsurf modifier on.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg27.png|575px]]|2=Leg assembly}}

There is still an issue though. This is not important in most part but will be taken care of for this time.

When one of the leg stops is selected in object mode, it would show that its center is not at the center of the mesh. The center is where the gizzmo (the red, blue and green arrow) would be located.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg29.png|575px]]|2=object center not at the center of the mesh}}

To correct this select the offending object. Click the Mesh menu (located at the header) and navigate to &quot;Transform&quot; and select &quot;Center New&quot; from the options. Blender would automatically calculate the new center based on the objects mesh. Now when the object is selected, the center would be located at a mush more appropriate location.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:BoxModelingSwanChairLeg30.png|600px]]|2=Center at proper place}}

Do the same to the other stoppers.

Now if you haven't named each individual part yet, You can do it now. Name each part sensible names like uppertelescope, lowertelescope, etc.

==The Whole Chair==

Unhide or Show the layer where your chair seat is so that it would unite with the legs. Now this is how the whole model should look like.

==Federalist No. 81==
Federalist No. 81 is titled ''&quot;The Judiciary Continued, and the Distribution of the Judicial Authority&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''LET US now return to the partition of the judiciary authority between different courts, and their relations to each other, &quot;The judicial power of the United States is&quot; (by the plan of the convention) &quot;to be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.&quot;''

''That there ought to be one court of supreme and final jurisdiction, is a proposition which is not likely to be contested. The reasons for it have been assigned in another place, and are too obvious to need repetition. The only question that seems to have been raised concerning it, is, whether it ought to be a distinct body or a branch of the legislature. The same contradiction is observable in regard to this matter which has been remarked in several other cases. The very men who object to the Senate as a court of impeachments, on the ground of an improper intermixture of powers, advocate, by implication at least, the propriety of vesting the ultimate decision of all causes, in the whole or in a part of the legislative body.''

''The arguments, or rather suggestions, upon which this charge is founded, are to this effect: &quot;The authority of the proposed Supreme Court of the United States, which is to be a separate and independent body, will be superior to that of the legislature. The power of construing the laws according to the SPIRIT of the Constitution, will enable that court to mould them into whatever shape it may think proper; especially as its decisions will not be in any manner subject to the revision or correction of the legislative body. This is as unprecedented as it is dangerous. In Britain, the judicial power, in the last resort, resides in the House of Lords, which is a branch of the legislature; and this part of the British government has been imitated in the State constitutions in general. The Parliament of Great Britain, and the legislatures of the several States, can at any time rectify, by law, the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts. But the errors and usurpations of the Supreme Court of the United States will be uncontrollable and remediless.&quot; This, upon examination, will be found to be made up altogether of false reasoning upon misconceived fact.''

''In the first place, there is not a syllable in the plan under consideration which DIRECTLY empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the Constitution, or which gives them any greater latitude in this respect than may be claimed by the courts of every State. I admit, however, that the Constitution ought to be the standard of construction for the laws, and that wherever there is an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the Constitution. But this doctrine is not deducible from any circumstance peculiar to the plan of the convention, but from the general theory of a limited Constitution; and as far as it is true, is equally applicable to most, if not to all the State governments. There can be no objection, therefore, on this account, to the federal judicature which will not lie against the local judicatures in general, and which will not serve to condemn every constitution that attempts to set bounds to legislative discretion.''

''But perhaps the force of the objection may be thought to consist in the particular organization of the Supreme Court; in its being composed of a distinct body of magistrates, instead of being one of the branches of the legislature, as in the government of Great Britain and that of the State. To insist upon this point, the authors of the objection must renounce the meaning they have labored to annex to the celebrated maxim, requiring a separation of the departments of power. It shall, nevertheless, be conceded to them, agreeably to the interpretation given to that maxim in the course of these papers, that it is not violated by vesting the ultimate power of judging in a PART of the legislative body. But though this be not an absolute violation of that excellent rule, yet it verges so nearly upon it, as on this account alone to be less eligible than the mode preferred by the convention. From a body which had even a partial agency in passing bad laws, we could rarely expect a disposition to temper and moderate them in the application. The same spirit which had operated in making them, would be too apt in interpreting them; still less could it be expected that men who had infringed the Constitution in the character of legislators, would be disposed to repair the breach in the character of judges. Nor is this all. Every reason which recommends the tenure of good behavior for judicial offices, militates against placing the judiciary power, in the last resort, in a body composed of men chosen for a limited period. There is an absurdity in referring the determination of causes, in the first instance, to judges of permanent standing; in the last, to those of a temporary and mutable constitution. And there is a still greater absurdity in subjecting the decisions of men, selected for their knowledge of the laws, acquired by long and laborious study, to the revision and control of men who, for want of the same advantage, cannot but be deficient in that knowledge. The members of the legislature will rarely be chosen with a view to those qualifications which fit men for the stations of judges; and as, on this account, there will be great reason to apprehend all the ill consequences of defective information, so, on account of the natural propensity of such bodies to party divisions, there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice. The habit of being continually marshalled on opposite sides will be too apt to stifle the voice both of law and of equity.''

''These considerations teach us to applaud the wisdom of those States who have committed the judicial power, in the last resort, not to a part of the legislature, but to distinct and independent bodies of men. Contrary to the supposition of those who have represented the plan of the convention, in this respect, as novel and unprecedented, it is but a copy of the constitutions of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia; and the preference which has been given to those models is highly to be commended.''

''It is not true, in the second place, that the Parliament of Great Britain, or the legislatures of the particular States, can rectify the exceptionable decisions of their respective courts, in any other sense than might be done by a future legislature of the United States. The theory, neither of the British, nor the State constitutions, authorizes the revisal of a judicial sentence by a legislative act. Nor is there any thing in the proposed Constitution, more than in either of them, by which it is forbidden. In the former, as well as in the latter, the impropriety of the thing, on the general principles of law and reason, is the sole obstacle. A legislature, without exceeding its province, cannot reverse a determination once made in a particular case; though it may prescribe a new rule for future cases. This is the principle, and it applies in all its consequences, exactly in the same manner and extent, to the State governments, as to the national government now under consideration. Not the least difference can be pointed out in any view of the subject.''

''It may in the last place be observed that the supposed danger of judiciary encroachments on the legislative authority, which has been upon many occasions reiterated, is in reality a phantom. Particular misconstructions and contraventions of the will of the legislature may now and then happen; but they can never be so extensive as to amount to an inconvenience, or in any sensible degree to affect the order of the political system. This may be inferred with certainty, from the general nature of the judicial power, from the objects to which it relates, from the manner in which it is exercised, from its comparative weakness, and from its total incapacity to support its usurpations by force. And the inference is greatly fortified by the consideration of the important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachments in one part of the legislative body, and of determining upon them in the other, would give to that body upon the members of the judicial department. This is alone a complete security. There never can be danger that the judges, by a series of deliberate usurpations on the authority of the legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the body intrusted with it, while this body was possessed of the means of punishing their presumption, by degrading them from their stations. While this ought to remove all apprehensions on the subject, it affords, at the same time, a cogent argument for constituting the Senate a court for the trial of impeachments.''

''Having now examined, and, I trust, removed the objections to the distinct and independent organization of the Supreme Court, I proceed to consider the propriety of the power of constituting inferior courts, and the relations which will subsist between these and the former.''

''The power of constituting inferior courts is evidently calculated to obviate the necessity of having recourse to the Supreme Court in every case of federal cognizance. It is intended to enable the national government to institute or AUTHORIZE, in each State or district of the United States, a tribunal competent to the determination of matters of national jurisdiction within its limits.''

''But why, it is asked, might not the same purpose have been accomplished by the instrumentality of the State courts? This admits of different answers. Though the fitness and competency of those courts should be allowed in the utmost latitude, yet the substance of the power in question may still be regarded as a necessary part of the plan, if it were only to empower the national legislature to commit to them the cognizance of causes arising out of the national Constitution. To confer the power of determining such causes upon the existing courts of the several States, would perhaps be as much &quot;to constitute tribunals,&quot; as to create new courts with the like power. But ought not a more direct and explicit provision to have been made in favor of the State courts? There are, in my opinion, substantial reasons against such a provision: the most discerning cannot foresee how far the prevalency of a local spirit may be found to disqualify the local tribunals for the jurisdiction of national causes; whilst every man may discover, that courts constituted like those of some of the States would be improper channels of the judicial authority of the Union. State judges, holding their offices during pleasure, or from year to year, will be too little independent to be relied upon for an inflexible execution of the national laws. And if there was a necessity for confiding the original cognizance of causes arising under those laws to them there would be a correspondent necessity for leaving the door of appeal as wide as possible. In proportion to the grounds of confidence in, or distrust of, the subordinate tribunals, ought to be the facility or difficulty of appeals. And well satisfied as I am of the propriety of the appellate jurisdiction, in the several classes of causes to which it is extended by the plan of the convention. I should consider every thing calculated to give, in practice, an UNRESTRAINED COURSE to appeals, as a source of public and private inconvenience.''

''I am not sure, but that it will be found highly expedient and useful, to divide the United States into four or five or half a dozen districts; and to institute a federal court in each district, in lieu of one in every State. The judges of these courts, with the aid of the State judges, may hold circuits for the trial of causes in the several parts of the respective districts. Justice through them may be administered with ease and despatch; and appeals may be safely circumscribed within a narrow compass. This plan appears to me at present the most eligible of any that could be adopted; and in order to it, it is necessary that the power of constituting inferior courts should exist in the full extent in which it is to be found in the proposed Constitution.''

''These reasons seem sufficient to satisfy a candid mind, that the want of such a power would have been a great defect in the plan. Let us now examine in what manner the judicial authority is to be distributed between the supreme and the inferior courts of the Union. The Supreme Court is to be invested with original jurisdiction, only &quot;in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and those in which A STATE shall be a party.&quot; Public ministers of every class are the immediate representatives of their sovereigns. All questions in which they are concerned are so directly connected with the public peace, that, as well for the preservation of this, as out of respect to the sovereignties they represent, it is both expedient and proper that such questions should be submitted in the first instance to the highest judicatory of the nation. Though consuls have not in strictness a diplomatic character, yet as they are the public agents of the nations to which they belong, the same observation is in a great measure applicable to them. In cases in which a State might happen to be a party, it would ill suit its dignity to be turned over to an inferior tribunal. Though it may rather be a digression from the immediate subject of this paper, I shall take occasion to mention here a supposition which has excited some alarm upon very mistaken grounds. It has been suggested that an assignment of the public securities of one State to the citizens of another, would enable them to prosecute that State in the federal courts for the amount of those securities; a suggestion which the following considerations prove to be without foundation.''

''It is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual WITHOUT ITS CONSENT. This is the general sense, and the general practice of mankind; and the exemption, as one of the attributes of sovereignty, is now enjoyed by the government of every State in the Union. Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunity in the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States, and the danger intimated must be merely ideal. The circumstances which are necessary to produce an alienation of State sovereignty were discussed in considering the article of taxation, and need not be repeated here. A recurrence to the principles there established will satisfy us, that there is no color to pretend that the State governments would, by the adoption of that plan, be divested of the privilege of paying their own debts in their own way, free from every constraint but that which flows from the obligations of good faith. The contracts between a nation and individuals are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign, and have no pretensions to a compulsive force. They confer no right of action, independent of the sovereign will. To what purpose would it be to authorize suits against States for the debts they owe? How could recoveries be enforced? It is evident, it could not be done without waging war against the contracting State; and to ascribe to the federal courts, by mere implication, and in destruction of a pre-existing right of the State governments, a power which would involve such a consequence, would be altogether forced and unwarrantable.''

''Let us resume the train of our observations. We have seen that the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court would be confined to two classes of causes, and those of a nature rarely to occur. In all other cases of federal cognizance, the original jurisdiction would appertain to the inferior tribunals; and the Supreme Court would have nothing more than an appellate jurisdiction, &quot;with such EXCEPTIONS and under such REGULATIONS as the Congress shall make.&quot;''

''The propriety of this appellate jurisdiction has been scarcely called in question in regard to matters of law; but the clamors have been loud against it as applied to matters of fact. Some well-intentioned men in this State, deriving their notions from the language and forms which obtain in our courts, have been induced to consider it as an implied supersedure of the trial by jury, in favor of the civil-law mode of trial, which prevails in our courts of admiralty, probate, and chancery. A technical sense has been affixed to the term &quot;appellate,&quot; which, in our law parlance, is commonly used in reference to appeals in the course of the civil law. But if I am not misinformed, the same meaning would not be given to it in any part of New England. There an appeal from one jury to another, is familiar both in language and practice, and is even a matter of course, until there have been two verdicts on one side. The word &quot;appellate,&quot; therefore, will not be understood in the same sense in New England as in New York, which shows the impropriety of a technical interpretation derived from the jurisprudence of any particular State. The expression, taken in the abstract, denotes nothing more than the power of one tribunal to review the proceedings of another, either as to the law or fact, or both. The mode of doing it may depend on ancient custom or legislative provision (in a new government it must depend on the latter), and may be with or without the aid of a jury, as may be judged advisable. If, therefore, the re-examination of a fact once determined by a jury, should in any case be admitted under the proposed Constitution, it may be so regulated as to be done by a second jury, either by remanding the cause to the court below for a second trial of the fact, or by directing an issue immediately out of the Supreme Court.''

''But it does not follow that the re-examination of a fact once ascertained by a jury, will be permitted in the Supreme Court. Why may not it be said, with the strictest propriety, when a writ of error is brought from an inferior to a superior court of law in this State, that the latter has jurisdiction of the fact as well as the law? It is true it cannot institute a new inquiry concerning the fact, but it takes cognizance of it as it appears upon the record, and pronounces the law arising upon it. This is jurisdiction of both fact and law; nor is it even possible to separate them. Though the common-law courts of this State ascertain disputed facts by a jury, yet they unquestionably have jurisdiction of both fact and law; and accordingly when the former is agreed in the pleadings, they have no recourse to a jury, but proceed at once to judgment. I contend, therefore, on this ground, that the expressions, &quot;appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,&quot; do not necessarily imply a re-examination in the Supreme Court of facts decided by juries in the inferior courts.''

''The following train of ideas may well be imagined to have influenced the convention, in relation to this particular provision. The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (it may have been argued) will extend to causes determinable in different modes, some in the course of the COMMON LAW, others in the course of the CIVIL LAW. In the former, the revision of the law only will be, generally speaking, the proper province of the Supreme Court; in the latter, the re-examination of the fact is agreeable to usage, and in some cases, of which prize causes are an example, might be essential to the preservation of the public peace. It is therefore necessary that the appellate jurisdiction should, in certain cases, extend in the broadest sense to matters of fact. It will not answer to make an express exception of cases which shall have been originally tried by a jury, because in the courts of some of the States ALL CAUSES are tried in this mode; and such an exception would preclude the revision of matters of fact, as well where it might be proper, as where it might be improper. To avoid all inconveniences, it will be safest to declare generally, that the Supreme Court shall possess appellate jurisdiction both as to law and FACT, and that this jurisdiction shall be subject to such EXCEPTIONS and regulations as the national legislature may prescribe. This will enable the government to modify it in such a manner as will best answer the ends of public justice and security.''

''This view of the matter, at any rate, puts it out of all doubt that the supposed ABOLITION of the trial by jury, by the operation of this provision, is fallacious and untrue. The legislature of the United States would certainly have full power to provide, that in appeals to the Supreme Court there should be no re-examination of facts where they had been tried in the original causes by juries. This would certainly be an authorized exception; but if, for the reason already intimated, it should be thought too extensive, it might be qualified with a limitation to such causes only as are determinable at common law in that mode of trial.''

''The amount of the observations hitherto made on the authority of the judicial department is this: that it has been carefully restricted to those causes which are manifestly proper for the cognizance of the national judicature; that in the partition of this authority a very small portion of original jurisdiction has been preserved to the Supreme Court, and the rest consigned to the subordinate tribunals; that the Supreme Court will possess an appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, in all the cases referred to them, both subject to any EXCEPTIONS and REGULATIONS which may be thought advisable; that this appellate jurisdiction does, in no case, ABOLISH the trial by jury; and that an ordinary degree of prudence and integrity in the national councils will insure us solid advantages from the establishment of the proposed judiciary, without exposing us to any of the inconveniences which have been predicted from that source.''

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper addresses how the powers of the judiciary should be distributed. It deals with potential fears for the irreversible effects of judicial activism and is also the fourth in a series of six essays discussing the powers and limitations of the judicial branch of government.

==Federalist No. 82==
Federalist No. 82 is titled ''&quot;The Judiciary Continued&quot;''. This Federalist Paper was written by Alexander Hamilton.

===Text===
''To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE erection of a new government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work, cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties. 'T is time only that can mature and perfect so compound a system, can liquidate the meaning of all the parts, and can adjust them to each other in a harmonious and consistent WHOLE.''

''Such questions, accordingly, have arisen upon the plan proposed by the convention, and particularly concerning the judiciary department. The principal of these respect the situation of the State courts in regard to those causes which are to be submitted to federal jurisdiction. Is this to be exclusive, or are those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction? If the latter, in what relation will they stand to the national tribunals? These are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense, and which are certainly entitled to attention.''

''The principles established in a former paper teach us that the States will retain all PRE-EXISTING authorities which may not be exclusively delegated to the federal head; and that this exclusive delegation can only exist in one of three cases: where an exclusive authority is, in express terms, granted to the Union; or where a particular authority is granted to the Union, and the exercise of a like authority is prohibited to the States; or where an authority is granted to the Union, with which a similar authority in the States would be utterly incompatible. Though these principles may not apply with the same force to the judiciary as to the legislative power, yet I am inclined to think that they are, in the main, just with respect to the former, as well as the latter. And under this impression, I shall lay it down as a rule, that the State courts will RETAIN the jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to be taken away in one of the enumerated modes.''

''The only thing in the proposed Constitution, which wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance to the federal courts, is contained in this passage: &quot;The JUDICIAL POWER of the United States SHALL BE VESTED in one Supreme Court, and in SUCH inferior courts as the Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.&quot; This might either be construed to signify, that the supreme and subordinate courts of the Union should alone have the power of deciding those causes to which their authority is to extend; or simply to denote, that the organs of the national judiciary should be one Supreme Court, and as many subordinate courts as Congress should think proper to appoint; or in other words, that the United States should exercise the judicial power with which they are to be invested, through one supreme tribunal, and a certain number of inferior ones, to be instituted by them. The first excludes, the last admits, the concurrent jurisdiction of the State tribunals; and as the first would amount to an alienation of State power by implication, the last appears to me the most natural and the most defensible construction.''

''But this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only clearly applicable to those descriptions of causes of which the State courts have previous cognizance. It is not equally evident in relation to cases which may grow out of, and be PECULIAR to, the Constitution to be established; for not to allow the State courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases, can hardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing authority. I mean not therefore to contend that the United States, in the course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their direction, may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a particular regulation to the federal courts solely, if such a measure should be deemed expedient; but I hold that the State courts will be divested of no part of their primitive jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I am even of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly excluded by the future acts of the national legislature, they will of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may give birth. This I infer from the nature of judiciary power, and from the general genius of the system. The judiciary power of every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws, and in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes of dispute are relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe. Those of Japan, not less than of New York, may furnish the objects of legal discussion to our courts. When in addition to this we consider the State governments and the national governments, as they truly are, in the light of kindred systems, and as parts of ONE WHOLE, the inference seems to be conclusive, that the State courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases arising under the laws of the Union, where it was not expressly prohibited.''

''Here another question occurs: What relation would subsist between the national and State courts in these instances of concurrent jurisdiction? I answer, that an appeal would certainly lie from the latter, to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Constitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in all the enumerated cases of federal cognizance in which it is not to have an original one, without a single expression to confine its operation to the inferior federal courts. The objects of appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. From this circumstance, and from the reason of the thing, it ought to be construed to extend to the State tribunals. Either this must be the case, or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent jurisdiction in matters of national concern, else the judiciary authority of the Union may be eluded at the pleasure of every plaintiff or prosecutor. Neither of these consequences ought, without evident necessity, to be involved; the latter would be entirely inadmissible, as it would defeat some of the most important and avowed purposes of the proposed government, and would essentially embarrass its measures. Nor do I perceive any foundation for such a supposition. Agreeably to the remark already made, the national and State systems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE. The courts of the latter will of course be natural auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the Union, and an appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal which is destined to unite and assimilate the principles of national justice and the rules of national decisions. The evident aim of the plan of the convention is, that all the causes of the specified classes shall, for weighty public reasons, receive their original or final determination in the courts of the Union. To confine, therefore, the general expressions giving appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, to appeals from the subordinate federal courts, instead of allowing their extension to the State courts, would be to abridge the latitude of the terms, in subversion of the intent, contrary to every sound rule of interpretation.''

''But could an appeal be made to lie from the State courts to the subordinate federal judicatories? This is another of the questions which have been raised, and of greater difficulty than the former. The following considerations countenance the affirmative. The plan of the convention, in the first place, authorizes the national legislature &quot;to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court.&quot; It declares, in the next place, that &quot;the JUDICIAL POWER of the United States SHALL BE VESTED in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress shall ordain and establish&quot;; and it then proceeds to enumerate the cases to which this judicial power shall extend. It afterwards divides the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court into original and appellate, but gives no definition of that of the subordinate courts. The only outlines described for them, are that they shall be &quot;inferior to the Supreme Court,&quot; and that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal judiciary. Whether their authority shall be original or appellate, or both, is not declared. All this seems to be left to the discretion of the legislature. And this being the case, I perceive at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from the State courts to the subordinate national tribunals; and many advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined. It would diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal courts, and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The State tribunals may then be left with a more entire charge of federal causes; and appeals, in most cases in which they may be deemed proper, instead of being carried to the Supreme Court, may be made to lie from the State courts to district courts of the Union.''

'' To the People of the State of New York:''

''THE objection to the plan of the convention, which has met with most success in this State, and perhaps in several of the other States, is THAT RELATIVE TO THE WANT OF A CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION for the trial by jury in civil cases. The disingenuous form in which this objection is usually stated has been repeatedly adverted to and exposed, but continues to be pursued in all the conversations and writings of the opponents of the plan. The mere silence of the Constitution in regard to CIVIL CAUSES, is represented as an abolition of the trial by jury, and the declamations to which it has afforded a pretext are artfully calculated to induce a persuasion that this pretended abolition is complete and universal, extending not only to every species of civil, but even to CRIMINAL CAUSES. To argue with respect to the latter would, however, be as vain and fruitless as to attempt the serious proof of the EXISTENCE of MATTER, or to demonstrate any of those propositions which, by their own internal evidence, force conviction, when expressed in language adapted to convey their meaning.''

''With regard to civil causes, subtleties almost too contemptible for refutation have been employed to countenance the surmise that a thing which is only NOT PROVIDED FOR, is entirely ABOLISHED. Every man of discernment must at once perceive the wide difference between SILENCE and ABOLITION. But as the inventors of this fallacy have attempted to support it by certain LEGAL MAXIMS of interpretation, which they have perverted from their true meaning, it may not be wholly useless to explore the ground they have taken.''

''The maxims on which they rely are of this nature: &quot;A specification of particulars is an exclusion of generals&quot;; or, &quot;The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.&quot; Hence, say they, as the Constitution has established the trial by jury in criminal cases, and is silent in respect to civil, this silence is an implied prohibition of trial by jury in regard to the latter.''

''The rules of legal interpretation are rules of COMMONSENSE, adopted by the courts in the construction of the laws. The true test, therefore, of a just application of them is its conformity to the source from which they are derived. This being the case, let me ask if it is consistent with common-sense to suppose that a provision obliging the legislative power to commit the trial of criminal causes to juries, is a privation of its right to authorize or permit that mode of trial in other cases? Is it natural to suppose, that a command to do one thing is a prohibition to the doing of another, which there was a previous power to do, and which is not incompatible with the thing commanded to be done? If such a supposition would be unnatural and unreasonable, it cannot be rational to maintain that an injunction of the trial by jury in certain cases is an interdiction of it in others.''

''A power to constitute courts is a power to prescribe the mode of trial; and consequently, if nothing was said in the Constitution on the subject of juries, the legislature would be at liberty either to adopt that institution or to let it alone. This discretion, in regard to criminal causes, is abridged by the express injunction of trial by jury in all such cases; but it is, of course, left at large in relation to civil causes, there being a total silence on this head. The specification of an obligation to try all criminal causes in a particular mode, excludes indeed the obligation or necessity of employing the same mode in civil causes, but does not abridge THE POWER of the legislature to exercise that mode if it should be thought proper. The pretense, therefore, that the national legislature would not be at full liberty to submit all the civil causes of federal cognizance to the determination of juries, is a pretense destitute of all just foundation.''

''From these observations this conclusion results: that the trial by jury in civil cases would not be abolished; and that the use attempted to be made of the maxims which have been quoted, is contrary to reason and common-sense, and therefore not admissible. Even if these maxims had a precise technical sense, corresponding with the idea of those who employ them upon the present occasion, which, however, is not the case, they would still be inapplicable to a constitution of government. In relation to such a subject, the natural and obvious sense of its provisions, apart from any technical rules, is the true criterion of construction.''

''Having now seen that the maxims relied upon will not bear the use made of them, let us endeavor to ascertain their proper use and true meaning. This will be best done by examples. The plan of the convention declares that the power of Congress, or, in other words, of the NATIONAL LEGISLATURE, shall extend to certain enumerated cases. This specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority, because an affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a general authority was intended.''

''In like manner the judicial authority of the federal judicatures is declared by the Constitution to comprehend certain cases particularly specified. The expression of those cases marks the precise limits, beyond which the federal courts cannot extend their jurisdiction, because the objects of their cognizance being enumerated, the specification would be nugatory if it did not exclude all ideas of more extensive authority.''

''These examples are sufficient to elucidate the maxims which have been mentioned, and to designate the manner in which they should be used. But that there may be no misapprehensions upon this subject, I shall add one case more, to demonstrate the proper use of these maxims, and the abuse which has been made of them.''

''Let us suppose that by the laws of this State a married woman was incapable of conveying her estate, and that the legislature, considering this as an evil, should enact that she might dispose of her property by deed executed in the presence of a magistrate. In such a case there can be no doubt but the specification would amount to an exclusion of any other mode of conveyance, because the woman having no previous power to alienate her property, the specification determines the particular mode which she is, for that purpose, to avail herself of. But let us further suppose that in a subsequent part of the same act it should be declared that no woman should dispose of any estate of a determinate value without the consent of three of her nearest relations, signified by their signing the deed; could it be inferred from this regulation that a married woman might not procure the approbation of her relations to a deed for conveying property of inferior value? The position is too absurd to merit a refutation, and yet this is precisely the position which those must establish who contend that the trial by juries in civil cases is abolished, because it is expressly provided for in cases of a criminal nature.''

''From these observations it must appear unquestionably true, that trial by jury is in no case abolished by the proposed Constitution, and it is equally true, that in those controversies between individuals in which the great body of the people are likely to be interested, that institution will remain precisely in the same situation in which it is placed by the State constitutions, and will be in no degree altered or influenced by the adoption of the plan under consideration. The foundation of this assertion is, that the national judiciary will have no cognizance of them, and of course they will remain determinable as heretofore by the State courts only, and in the manner which the State constitutions and laws prescribe. All land causes, except where claims under the grants of different States come into question, and all other controversies between the citizens of the same State, unless where they depend upon positive violations of the articles of union, by acts of the State legislatures, will belong exclusively to the jurisdiction of the State tribunals. Add to this, that admiralty causes, and almost all those which are of equity jurisdiction, are determinable under our own government without the intervention of a jury, and the inference from the whole will be, that this institution, as it exists with us at present, cannot possibly be affected to any great extent by the proposed alteration in our system of government.''

''The friends and adversaries of the plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing else, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial by jury; or if there is any difference between them it consists in this: the former regard it as a valuable safeguard to liberty; the latter represent it as the very palladium of free government. For my own part, the more the operation of the institution has fallen under my observation, the more reason I have discovered for holding it in high estimation; and it would be altogether superfluous to examine to what extent it deserves to be esteemed useful or essential in a representative republic, or how much more merit it may be entitled to, as a defense against the oppressions of an hereditary monarch, than as a barrier to the tyranny of popular magistrates in a popular government. Discussions of this kind would be more curious than beneficial, as all are satisfied of the utility of the institution, and of its friendly aspect to liberty. But I must acknowledge that I cannot readily discern the inseparable connection between the existence of liberty, and the trial by jury in civil cases. Arbitrary impeachments, arbitrary methods of prosecuting pretended offenses, and arbitrary punishments upon arbitrary convictions, have ever appeared to me to be the great engines of judicial despotism; and these have all relation to criminal proceedings. The trial by jury in criminal cases, aided by the habeas-corpus act, seems therefore to be alone concerned in the question. And both of these are provided for, in the most ample manner, in the plan of the convention.''

''It has been observed, that trial by jury is a safeguard against an oppressive exercise of the power of taxation. This observation deserves to be canvassed.''

''It is evident that it can have no influence upon the legislature, in regard to the AMOUNT of taxes to be laid, to the OBJECTS upon which they are to be imposed, or to the RULE by which they are to be apportioned. If it can have any influence, therefore, it must be upon the mode of collection, and the conduct of the officers intrusted with the execution of the revenue laws.''

''As to the mode of collection in this State, under our own Constitution, the trial by jury is in most cases out of use. The taxes are usually levied by the more summary proceeding of distress and sale, as in cases of rent. And it is acknowledged on all hands, that this is essential to the efficacy of the revenue laws. The dilatory course of a trial at law to recover the taxes imposed on individuals, would neither suit the exigencies of the public nor promote the convenience of the citizens. It would often occasion an accumulation of costs, more burdensome than the original sum of the tax to be levied.''

''And as to the conduct of the officers of the revenue, the provision in favor of trial by jury in criminal cases, will afford the security aimed at. Wilful abuses of a public authority, to the oppression of the subject, and every species of official extortion, are offenses against the government, for which the persons who commit them may be indicted and punished according to the circumstances of the case.''

''The excellence of the trial by jury in civil cases appears to depend on circumstances foreign to the preservation of liberty. The strongest argument in its favor is, that it is a security against corruption. As there is always more time and better opportunity to tamper with a standing body of magistrates than with a jury summoned for the occasion, there is room to suppose that a corrupt influence would more easily find its way to the former than to the latter. The force of this consideration is, however, diminished by others. The sheriff, who is the summoner of ordinary juries, and the clerks of courts, who have the nomination of special juries, are themselves standing officers, and, acting individually, may be supposed more accessible to the touch of corruption than the judges, who are a collective body. It is not difficult to see, that it would be in the power of those officers to select jurors who would serve the purpose of the party as well as a corrupted bench. In the next place, it may fairly be supposed, that there would be less difficulty in gaining some of the jurors promiscuously taken from the public mass, than in gaining men who had been chosen by the government for their probity and good character. But making every deduction for these considerations, the trial by jury must still be a valuable check upon corruption. It greatly multiplies the impediments to its success. As matters now stand, it would be necessary to corrupt both court and jury; for where the jury have gone evidently wrong, the court will generally grant a new trial, and it would be in most cases of little use to practice upon the jury, unless the court could be likewise gained. Here then is a double security; and it will readily be perceived that this complicated agency tends to preserve the purity of both institutions. By increasing the obstacles to success, it discourages attempts to seduce the integrity of either. The temptations to prostitution which the judges might have to surmount, must certainly be much fewer, while the co-operation of a jury is necessary, than they might be, if they had themselves the exclusive determination of all causes.''

''Notwithstanding, therefore, the doubts I have expressed, as to the essentiality of trial by jury in civil cases to liberty, I admit that it is in most cases, under proper regulations, an excellent method of determining questions of property; and that on this account alone it would be entitled to a constitutional provision in its favor if it were possible to fix the limits within which it ought to be comprehended. There is, however, in all cases, great difficulty in this; and men not blinded by enthusiasm must be sensible that in a federal government, which is a composition of societies whose ideas and institutions in relation to the matter materially vary from each other, that difficulty must be not a little augmented. For my own part, at every new view I take of the subject, I become more convinced of the reality of the obstacles which, we are authoritatively informed, prevented the insertion of a provision on this head in the plan of the convention.''

''The great difference between the limits of the jury trial in different States is not generally understood; and as it must have considerable influence on the sentence we ought to pass upon the omission complained of in regard to this point, an explanation of it is necessary. In this State, our judicial establishments resemble, more nearly than in any other, those of Great Britain. We have courts of common law, courts of probates (analogous in certain matters to the spiritual courts in England), a court of admiralty and a court of chancery. In the courts of common law only, the trial by jury prevails, and this with some exceptions. In all the others a single judge presides, and proceeds in general either according to the course of the canon or civil law, without the aid of a jury. In New Jersey, there is a court of chancery which proceeds like ours, but neither courts of admiralty nor of probates, in the sense in which these last are established with us. In that State the courts of common law have the cognizance of those causes which with us are determinable in the courts of admiralty and of probates, and of course the jury trial is more extensive in New Jersey than in New York. In Pennsylvania, this is perhaps still more the case, for there is no court of chancery in that State, and its common-law courts have equity jurisdiction. It has a court of admiralty, but none of probates, at least on the plan of ours. Delaware has in these respects imitated Pennsylvania. Maryland approaches more nearly to New York, as does also Virginia, except that the latter has a plurality of chancellors. North Carolina bears most affinity to Pennsylvania; South Carolina to Virginia. I believe, however, that in some of those States which have distinct courts of admiralty, the causes depending in them are triable by juries. In Georgia there are none but common-law courts, and an appeal of course lies from the verdict of one jury to another, which is called a special jury, and for which a particular mode of appointment is marked out. In Connecticut, they have no distinct courts either of chancery or of admiralty, and their courts of probates have no jurisdiction of causes. Their common-law courts have admiralty and, to a certain extent, equity jurisdiction. In cases of importance, their General Assembly is the only court of chancery. In Connecticut, therefore, the trial by jury extends in PRACTICE further than in any other State yet mentioned. Rhode Island is, I believe, in this particular, pretty much in the situation of Connecticut. Massachusetts and New Hampshire, in regard to the blending of law, equity, and admiralty jurisdictions, are in a similar predicament. In the four Eastern States, the trial by jury not only stands upon a broader foundation than in the other States, but it is attended with a peculiarity unknown, in its full extent, to any of them. There is an appeal OF COURSE from one jury to another, till there have been two verdicts out of three on one side.''

''From this sketch it appears that there is a material diversity, as well in the modification as in the extent of the institution of trial by jury in civil cases, in the several States; and from this fact these obvious reflections flow: first, that no general rule could have been fixed upon by the convention which would have corresponded with the circumstances of all the States; and secondly, that more or at least as much might have been hazarded by taking the system of any one State for a standard, as by omitting a provision altogether and leaving the matter, as has been done, to legislative regulation.''

''The propositions which have been made for supplying the omission have rather served to illustrate than to obviate the difficulty of the thing. The minority of Pennsylvania have proposed this mode of expression for the purpose &quot;Trial by jury shall be as heretofore&quot; and this I maintain would be senseless and nugatory. The United States, in their united or collective capacity, are the OBJECT to which all general provisions in the Constitution must necessarily be construed to refer. Now it is evident that though trial by jury, with various limitations, is known in each State individually, yet in the United States, AS SUCH, it is at this time altogether unknown, because the present federal government has no judiciary power whatever; and consequently there is no proper antecedent or previous establishment to which the term HERETOFORE could relate. It would therefore be destitute of a precise meaning, and inoperative from its uncertainty.''

''As, on the one hand, the form of the provision would not fulfil the intent of its proposers, so, on the other, if I apprehend that intent rightly, it would be in itself inexpedient. I presume it to be, that causes in the federal courts should be tried by jury, if, in the State where the courts sat, that mode of trial would obtain in a similar case in the State courts; that is to say, admiralty causes should be tried in Connecticut by a jury, in New York without one. The capricious operation of so dissimilar a method of trial in the same cases, under the same government, is of itself sufficient to indispose every well regulated judgment towards it. Whether the cause should be tried with or without a jury, would depend, in a great number of cases, on the accidental situation of the court and parties.''

''But this is not, in my estimation, the greatest objection. I feel a deep and deliberate conviction that there are many cases in which the trial by jury is an ineligible one. I think it so particularly in cases which concern the public peace with foreign nations that is, in most cases where the question turns wholly on the laws of nations. Of this nature, among others, are all prize causes. Juries cannot be supposed competent to investigations that require a thorough knowledge of the laws and usages of nations; and they will sometimes be under the influence of impressions which will not suffer them to pay sufficient regard to those considerations of public policy which ought to guide their inquiries. There would of course be always danger that the rights of other nations might be infringed by their decisions, so as to afford occasions of reprisal and war. Though the proper province of juries be to determine matters of fact, yet in most cases legal consequences are complicated with fact in such a manner as to render a separation impracticable.''

''It will add great weight to this remark, in relation to prize causes, to mention that the method of determining them has been thought worthy of particular regulation in various treaties between different powers of Europe, and that, pursuant to such treaties, they are determinable in Great Britain, in the last resort, before the king himself, in his privy council, where the fact, as well as the law, undergoes a re-examination. This alone demonstrates the impolicy of inserting a fundamental provision in the Constitution which would make the State systems a standard for the national government in the article under consideration, and the danger of encumbering the government with any constitutional provisions the propriety of which is not indisputable.''

''My convictions are equally strong that great advantages result from the separation of the equity from the law jurisdiction, and that the causes which belong to the former would be improperly committed to juries. The great and primary use of a court of equity is to give relief IN EXTRAORDINARY CASES, which are EXCEPTIONS to general rules. To unite the jurisdiction of such cases with the ordinary jurisdiction, must have a tendency to unsettle the general rules, and to subject every case that arises to a SPECIAL determination; while a separation of the one from the other has the contrary effect of rendering one a sentinel over the other, and of keeping each within the expedient limits. Besides this, the circumstances that constitute cases proper for courts of equity are in many instances so nice and intricate, that they are incompatible with the genius of trials by jury. They require often such long, deliberate, and critical investigation as would be impracticable to men called from their occupations, and obliged to decide before they were permitted to return to them. The simplicity and expedition which form the distinguishing characters of this mode of trial require that the matter to be decided should be reduced to some single and obvious point; while the litigations usual in chancery frequently comprehend a long train of minute and independent particulars.''

''It is true that the separation of the equity from the legal jurisdiction is peculiar to the English system of jurisprudence: which is the model that has been followed in several of the States. But it is equally true that the trial by jury has been unknown in every case in which they have been united. And the separation is essential to the preservation of that institution in its pristine purity. The nature of a court of equity will readily permit the extension of its jurisdiction to matters of law; but it is not a little to be suspected, that the attempt to extend the jurisdiction of the courts of law to matters of equity will not only be unproductive of the advantages which may be derived from courts of chancery, on the plan upon which they are established in this State, but will tend gradually to change the nature of the courts of law, and to undermine the trial by jury, by introducing questions too complicated for a decision in that mode.''

''These appeared to be conclusive reasons against incorporating the systems of all the States, in the formation of the national judiciary, according to what may be conjectured to have been the attempt of the Pennsylvania minority. Let us now examine how far the proposition of Massachusetts is calculated to remedy the supposed defect.''

''It is in this form: &quot;In civil actions between citizens of different States, every issue of fact, arising in ACTIONS AT COMMON LAW, may be tried by a jury if the parties, or either of them request it.&quot;''

''This, at best, is a proposition confined to one description of causes; and the inference is fair, either that the Massachusetts convention considered that as the only class of federal causes, in which the trial by jury would be proper; or that if desirous of a more extensive provision, they found it impracticable to devise one which would properly answer the end. If the first, the omission of a regulation respecting so partial an object can never be considered as a material imperfection in the system. If the last, it affords a strong corroboration of the extreme difficulty of the thing.''

''But this is not all: if we advert to the observations already made respecting the courts that subsist in the several States of the Union, and the different powers exercised by them, it will appear that there are no expressions more vague and indeterminate than those which have been employed to characterize THAT species of causes which it is intended shall be entitled to a trial by jury. In this State, the boundaries between actions at common law and actions of equitable jurisdiction, are ascertained in conformity to the rules which prevail in England upon that subject. In many of the other States the boundaries are less precise. In some of them every cause is to be tried in a court of common law, and upon that foundation every action may be considered as an action at common law, to be determined by a jury, if the parties, or either of them, choose it. Hence the same irregularity and confusion would be introduced by a compliance with this proposition, that I have already noticed as resulting from the regulation proposed by the Pennsylvania minority. In one State a cause would receive its determination from a jury, if the parties, or either of them, requested it; but in another State, a cause exactly similar to the other, must be decided without the intervention of a jury, because the State judicatories varied as to common-law jurisdiction.''

''It is obvious, therefore, that the Massachusetts proposition, upon this subject cannot operate as a general regulation, until some uniform plan, with respect to the limits of common-law and equitable jurisdictions, shall be adopted by the different States. To devise a plan of that kind is a task arduous in itself, and which it would require much time and reflection to mature. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to suggest any general regulation that would be acceptable to all the States in the Union, or that would perfectly quadrate with the several State institutions.''

''It may be asked, Why could not a reference have been made to the constitution of this State, taking that, which is allowed by me to be a good one, as a standard for the United States? I answer that it is not very probable the other States would entertain the same opinion of our institutions as we do ourselves. It is natural to suppose that they are hitherto more attached to their own, and that each would struggle for the preference. If the plan of taking one State as a model for the whole had been thought of in the convention, it is to be presumed that the adoption of it in that body would have been rendered difficult by the predilection of each representation in favor of its own government; and it must be uncertain which of the States would have been taken as the model. It has been shown that many of them would be improper ones. And I leave it to conjecture, whether, under all circumstances, it is most likely that New York, or some other State, would have been preferred. But admit that a judicious selection could have been effected in the convention, still there would have been great danger of jealousy and disgust in the other States, at the partiality which had been shown to the institutions of one. The enemies of the plan would have been furnished with a fine pretext for raising a host of local prejudices against it, which perhaps might have hazarded, in no inconsiderable degree, its final establishment.''

''To avoid the embarrassments of a definition of the cases which the trial by jury ought to embrace, it is sometimes suggested by men of enthusiastic tempers, that a provision might have been inserted for establishing it in all cases whatsoever. For this I believe, no precedent is to be found in any member of the Union; and the considerations which have been stated in discussing the proposition of the minority of Pennsylvania, must satisfy every sober mind that the establishment of the trial by jury in ALL cases would have been an unpardonable error in the plan.''

''In short, the more it is considered the more arduous will appear the task of fashioning a provision in such a form as not to express too little to answer the purpose, or too much to be advisable; or which might not have opened other sources of opposition to the great and essential object of introducing a firm national government.''

''I cannot but persuade myself, on the other hand, that the different lights in which the subject has been placed in the course of these observations, will go far towards removing in candid minds the apprehensions they may have entertained on the point. They have tended to show that the security of liberty is materially concerned only in the trial by jury in criminal cases, which is provided for in the most ample manner in the plan of the convention; that even in far the greatest proportion of civil cases, and those in which the great body of the community is interested, that mode of trial will remain in its full force, as established in the State constitutions, untouched and unaffected by the plan of the convention; that it is in no case abolished by that plan; and that there are great if not insurmountable difficulties in the way of making any precise and proper provision for it in a Constitution for the United States.''

''The best judges of the matter will be the least anxious for a constitutional establishment of the trial by jury in civil cases, and will be the most ready to admit that the changes which are continually happening in the affairs of society may render a different mode of determining questions of property preferable in many cases in which that mode of trial now prevails. For my part, I acknowledge myself to be convinced that even in this State it might be advantageously extended to some cases to which it does not at present apply, and might as advantageously be abridged in others. It is conceded by all reasonable men that it ought not to obtain in all cases. The examples of innovations which contract its ancient limits, as well in these States as in Great Britain, afford a strong presumption that its former extent has been found inconvenient, and give room to suppose that future experience may discover the propriety and utility of other exceptions. I suspect it to be impossible in the nature of the thing to fix the salutary point at which the operation of the institution ought to stop, and this is with me a strong argument for leaving the matter to the discretion of the legislature.''

''This is now clearly understood to be the case in Great Britain, and it is equally so in the State of Connecticut; and yet it may be safely affirmed that more numerous encroachments have been made upon the trial by jury in this State since the Revolution, though provided for by a positive article of our constitution, than has happened in the same time either in Connecticut or Great Britain. It may be added that these encroachments have generally originated with the men who endeavor to persuade the people they are the warmest defenders of popular liberty, but who have rarely suffered constitutional obstacles to arrest them in a favorite career. The truth is that the general GENIUS of a government is all that can be substantially relied upon for permanent effects. Particular provisions, though not altogether useless, have far less virtue and efficacy than are commonly ascribed to them; and the want of them will never be, with men of sound discernment, a decisive objection to any plan which exhibits the leading characters of a good government.''

''It certainly sounds not a little harsh and extraordinary to affirm that there is no security for liberty in a Constitution which expressly establishes the trial by jury in criminal cases, because it does not do it in civil also; while it is a notorious fact that Connecticut, which has been always regarded as the most popular State in the Union, can boast of no constitutional provision for either.''

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''IN THE course of the foregoing review of the Constitution, I have taken notice of, and endeavored to answer most of the objections which have appeared against it. There, however, remain a few which either did not fall naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their proper places. These shall now be discussed; but as the subject has been drawn into great length, I shall so far consult brevity as to comprise all my observations on these miscellaneous points in a single paper.''

''The most considerable of the remaining objections is that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights. Among other answers given to this, it has been upon different occasions remarked that the constitutions of several of the States are in a similar predicament. I add that New York is of the number. And yet the opposers of the new system, in this State, who profess an unlimited admiration for its constitution, are among the most intemperate partisans of a bill of rights. To justify their zeal in this matter, they allege two things: one is that, though the constitution of New York has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet it contains, in the body of it, various provisions in favor of particular privileges and rights, which, in substance amount to the same thing; the other is, that the Constitution adopts, in their full extent, the common and statute law of Great Britain, by which many other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.''

''To the first I answer, that the Constitution proposed by the convention contains, as well as the constitution of this State, a number of such provisions.''

''Independent of those which relate to the structure of the government, we find the following: Article 1, section 3, clause 7 &quot;Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall, nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.&quot; Section 9, of the same article, clause 2 &quot;The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.&quot; Clause 3 &quot;No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto law shall be passed.&quot; Clause 7 &quot;No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States; and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.&quot; Article 3, section 2, clause 3 &quot;The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.&quot; Section 3, of the same article &quot;Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.&quot; And clause 3, of the same section &quot;The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason; but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted.&quot; It may well be a question, whether these are not, upon the whole, of equal importance with any which are to be found in the constitution of this State. The establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of ex-post-facto laws, and of TITLES OF NOBILITY, TO WHICH WE HAVE NO CORRESPONDING PROVISION IN OUR CONSTITUTION, are perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any it contains. The creation of crimes after the commission of the fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The observations of the judicious Blackstone, in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: &quot;To bereave a man of life, Usays he,e or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore A MORE DANGEROUS ENGINE of arbitrary government.&quot; And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas-corpus act, which in one place he calls &quot;the BULWARK of the British Constitution.&quot;''

''Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner-stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.''

''To the second that is, to the pretended establishment of the common and state law by the Constitution, I answer, that they are expressly made subject &quot;to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same.&quot; They are therefore at any moment liable to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of course have no constitutional sanction. The only use of the declaration was to recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have been occasioned by the Revolution. This consequently can be considered as no part of a declaration of rights, which under our constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the government itself.''

''It has been several times truly remarked that bills of rights are, in their origin, stipulations between kings and their subjects, abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege, reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was MAGNA CHARTA, obtained by the barons, sword in hand, from King John. Such were the subsequent confirmations of that charter by succeeding princes. Such was the PETITION OF RIGHT assented to by Charles I., in the beginning of his reign. Such, also, was the Declaration of Right presented by the Lords and Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown into the form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights. It is evident, therefore, that, according to their primitive signification, they have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing; and as they retain every thing they have no need of particular reservations. &quot;WE, THE PEOPLE of the United States, to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ORDAIN and ESTABLISH this Constitution for the United States of America.&quot; Here is a better recognition of popular rights, than volumes of those aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our State bills of rights, and which would sound much better in a treatise of ethics than in a constitution of government.''

''But a minute detail of particular rights is certainly far less applicable to a Constitution like that under consideration, which is merely intended to regulate the general political interests of the nation, than to a constitution which has the regulation of every species of personal and private concerns. If, therefore, the loud clamors against the plan of the convention, on this score, are well founded, no epithets of reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of this State. But the truth is, that both of them contain all which, in relation to their objects, is reasonably to be desired.''

''I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the sense and to the extent in which they are contended for, are not only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not granted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason, that the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in the national government. This may serve as a specimen of the numerous handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of rights.''

''On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as has been said, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the first place, I observe, that there is not a syllable concerning it in the constitution of this State; in the next, I contend, that whatever has been said about it in that of any other State, amounts to nothing. What signifies a declaration, that &quot;the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved&quot;? What is the liberty of the press? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion? I hold it to be impracticable; and from this I infer, that its security, whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting it, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people and of the government. And here, after all, as is intimated upon another occasion, must we seek for the only solid basis of all our rights.''

''There remains but one other view of this matter to conclude the point. The truth is, after all the declamations we have heard, that the Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS. The several bills of rights in Great Britain form its Constitution, and conversely the constitution of each State is its bill of rights. And the proposed Constitution, if adopted, will be the bill of rights of the Union. Is it one object of a bill of rights to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in the structure and administration of the government? This is done in the most ample and precise manner in the plan of the convention; comprehending various precautions for the public security, which are not to be found in any of the State constitutions. Is another object of a bill of rights to define certain immunities and modes of proceeding, which are relative to personal and private concerns? This we have seen has also been attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan. Adverting therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights, it is absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the convention. It may be said that it does not go far enough, though it will not be easy to make this appear; but it can with no propriety be contended that there is no such thing. It certainly must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of declaring the rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in any part of the instrument which establishes the government. And hence it must be apparent, that much of what has been said on this subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions, entirely foreign from the substance of the thing.''

''Another objection which has been made, and which, from the frequency of its repetition, it is to be presumed is relied on, is of this nature: &quot;It is improper Usay the objectorse to confer such large powers, as are proposed, upon the national government, because the seat of that government must of necessity be too remote from many of the States to admit of a proper knowledge on the part of the constituent, of the conduct of the representative body.&quot; This argument, if it proves any thing, proves that there ought to be no general government whatever. For the powers which, it seems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be vested in the Union, cannot be safely intrusted to a body which is not under every requisite control. But there are satisfactory reasons to show that the objection is in reality not well founded. There is in most of the arguments which relate to distance a palpable illusion of the imagination. What are the sources of information by which the people in Montgomery County must regulate their judgment of the conduct of their representatives in the State legislature? Of personal observation they can have no benefit. This is confined to the citizens on the spot. They must therefore depend on the information of intelligent men, in whom they confide; and how must these men obtain their information? Evidently from the complexion of public measures, from the public prints, from correspondences with theirrepresentatives, and with other persons who reside at the place of their deliberations. This does not apply to Montgomery County only, but to all the counties at any considerable distance from the seat of government.''

''It is equally evident that the same sources of information would be open to the people in relation to the conduct of their representatives in the general government, and the impediments to a prompt communication which distance may be supposed to create, will be overbalanced by the effects of the vigilance of the State governments. The executive and legislative bodies of each State will be so many sentinels over the persons employed in every department of the national administration; and as it will be in their power to adopt and pursue a regular and effectual system of intelligence, they can never be at a loss to know the behavior of those who represent their constituents in the national councils, and can readily communicate the same knowledge to the people. Their disposition to apprise the community of whatever may prejudice its interests from another quarter, may be relied upon, if it were only from the rivalship of power. And we may conclude with the fullest assurance that the people, through that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of their national representatives, than they can be by any means they now possess of that of their State representatives.''

''It ought also to be remembered that the citizens who inhabit the country at and near the seat of government will, in all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity, have the same interest with those who are at a distance, and that they will stand ready to sound the alarm when necessary, and to point out the actors in any pernicious project. The public papers will be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the most remote inhabitants of the Union.''

''Among the many curious objections which have appeared against the proposed Constitution, the most extraordinary and the least colorable is derived from the want of some provision respecting the debts due TO the United States. This has been represented as a tacit relinquishment of those debts, and as a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters. The newspapers have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head; yet there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void of foundation, the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme dishonesty. In addition to the remarks I have made upon the subject in another place, I shall only observe that as it is a plain dictate of common-sense, so it is also an established doctrine of political law, that &quot;STATES NEITHER LOSE ANY OF THEIR RIGHTS, NOR ARE DISCHARGED FROM ANY OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS, BY A CHANGE IN THE FORM OF THEIR CIVIL GOVERNMENT.&quot; The last objection of any consequence, which I at present recollect, turns upon the article of expense. If it were even true, that the adoption of the proposed government would occasion a considerable increase of expense, it would be an objection that ought to have no weight against the plan.''

''The great bulk of the citizens of America are with reason convinced, that Union is the basis of their political happiness. Men of sense of all parties now, with few exceptions, agree that it cannot be preserved under the present system, nor without radical alterations; that new and extensive powers ought to be granted to the national head, and that these require a different organization of the federal government a single body being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities. In conceding all this, the question of expense must be given up; for it is impossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation upon which the system is to stand. The two branches of the legislature are, in the first instance, to consist of only sixty-five persons, which is the same number of which Congress, under the existing Confederation, may be composed. It is true that this number is intended to be increased; but this is to keep pace with the progress of the population and resources of the country. It is evident that a less number would, even in the first instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of the present number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a very inadequate representation of the people.''

''Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to spring? One source indicated, is the multiplication of offices under the new government. Let us examine this a little.''

''It is evident that the principal departments of the administration under the present government, are the same which will be required under the new. There are now a Secretary of War, a Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a Secretary for Domestic Affairs, a Board of Treasury, consisting of three persons, a Treasurer, assistants, clerks, etc. These officers are indispensable under any system, and will suffice under the new as well as the old. As to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign countries, the proposed Constitution can make no other difference than to render their characters, where they reside, more respectable, and their services more useful. As to persons to be employed in the collection of the revenues, it is unquestionably true that these will form a very considerable addition to the number of federal officers; but it will not follow that this will occasion an increase of public expense. It will be in most cases nothing more than an exchange of State for national officers. In the collection of all duties, for instance, the persons employed will be wholly of the latter description. The States individually will stand in no need of any for this purpose. What difference can it make in point of expense to pay officers of the customs appointed by the State or by the United States? There is no good reason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the latter will be greater than those of the former.''

''Where then are we to seek for those additional articles of expense which are to swell the account to the enormous size that has been represented to us? The chief item which occurs to me respects the support of the judges of the United States. I do not add the President, because there is now a president of Congress, whose expenses may not be far, if any thing, short of those which will be incurred on account of the President of the United States. The support of the judges will clearly be an extra expense, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan which may be adopted in regard to this matter. But upon no reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of material consequence.''

''Let us now see what there is to counterbalance any extra expense that may attend the establishment of the proposed government. The first thing which presents itself is that a great part of the business which now keeps Congress sitting through the year will be transacted by the President. Even the management of foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon him, according to general principles concerted with the Senate, and subject to their final concurrence. Hence it is evident that a portion of the year will suffice for the session of both the Senate and the House of Representatives; we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and a third, or perhaps half, for the former. The extra business of treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the Senate. From this circumstance we may infer that, until the House of Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present number, there will be a considerable saving of expense from the difference between the constant session of the present and the temporary session of the future Congress.''

''But there is another circumstance of great importance in the view of economy. The business of the United States has hitherto occupied the State legislatures, as well as Congress. The latter has made requisitions which the former have had to provide for. Hence it has happened that the sessions of the State legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was necessary for the execution of the mere local business of the States. More than half their time has been frequently employed in matters which related to the United States. Now the members who compose the legislatures of the several States amount to two thousand and upwards, which number has hitherto performed what under the new system will be done in the first instance by sixty-five persons, and probably at no future period by above a fourth or fifth of that number. The Congress under the proposed government will do all the business of the United States themselves, without the intervention of the State legislatures, who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their particular States, and will not have to sit in any proportion as long as they have heretofore done. This difference in the time of the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear gain, and will alone form an article of saving, which may be regarded as an equivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be occasioned by the adoption of the new system.''

''The result from these observations is that the sources of additional expense from the establishment of the proposed Constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined; that they are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving; and that while it is questionable on which side the scale will preponderate, it is certain that a government less expensive would be incompetent to the purposes of the Union.'' 

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper is notable for presenting the idea that a [[../../Bill of Rights/]] was not a necessary component of the proposed [[../../Constitution|United States Constitution]]. The Constitution, as originally written, did not specifically enumerate or protect the rights of the people. It is alleged that many Americans at the time opposed the inclusion of a Bill of Rights: if such a bill were created, they feared, this might later be interpreted as a list of the ''only'' rights that people had.

''To the People of the State of New York:''

''ACCORDING to the formal division of the subject of these papers, announced in my first number, there would appear still to remain for discussion two points: &quot;the analogy of the proposed government to your own State constitution,&quot; and &quot;the additional security which its adoption will afford to republican government, to liberty, and to property.&quot; But these heads have been so fully anticipated and exhausted in the progress of the work, that it would now scarcely be possible to do any thing more than repeat, in a more dilated form, what has been heretofore said, which the advanced stage of the question, and the time already spent upon it, conspire to forbid.''

''It is remarkable, that the resemblance of the plan of the convention to the act which organizes the government of this State holds, not less with regard to many of the supposed defects, than to the real excellences of the former. Among the pretended defects are the re-eligibility of the Executive, the want of a council, the omission of a formal bill of rights, the omission of a provision respecting the liberty of the press. These and several others which have been noted in the course of our inquiries are as much chargeable on the existing constitution of this State, as on the one proposed for the Union; and a man must have slender pretensions to consistency, who can rail at the latter for imperfections which he finds no difficulty in excusing in the former. Nor indeed can there be a better proof of the insincerity and affectation of some of the zealous adversaries of the plan of the convention among us, who profess to be the devoted admirers of the government under which they live, than the fury with which they have attacked that plan, for matters in regard to which our own constitution is equally or perhaps more vulnerable.''

''The additional securities to republican government, to liberty and to property, to be derived from the adoption of the plan under consideration, consist chiefly in the restraints which the preservation of the Union will impose on local factions and insurrections, and on the ambition of powerful individuals in single States, who may acquire credit and influence enough, from leaders and favorites, to become the despots of the people; in the diminution of the opportunities to foreign intrigue, which the dissolution of the Confederacy would invite and facilitate; in the prevention of extensive military establishments, which could not fail to grow out of wars between the States in a disunited situation; in the express guaranty of a republican form of government to each; in the absolute and universal exclusion of titles of nobility; and in the precautions against the repetition of those practices on the part of the State governments which have undermined the foundations of property and credit, have planted mutual distrust in the breasts of all classes of citizens, and have occasioned an almost universal prostration of morals.''

''Thus have I, fellow-citizens, executed the task I had assigned to myself; with what success, your conduct must determine. I trust at least you will admit that I have not failed in the assurance I gave you respecting the spirit with which my endeavors should be conducted. I have addressed myself purely to your judgments, and have studiously avoided those asperities which are too apt to disgrace political disputants of all parties, and which have been not a little provoked by the language and conduct of the opponents of the Constitution. The charge of a conspiracy against the liberties of the people, which has been indiscriminately brought against the advocates of the plan, has something in it too wanton and too malignant, not to excite the indignation of every man who feels in his own bosom a refutation of the calumny. The perpetual changes which have been rung upon the wealthy, the well-born, and the great, have been such as to inspire the disgust of all sensible men. And the unwarrantable concealments and misrepresentations which have been in various ways practiced to keep the truth from the public eye, have been of a nature to demand the reprobation of all honest men. It is not impossible that these circumstances may have occasionally betrayed me into intemperances of expression which I did not intend; it is certain that I have frequently felt a struggle between sensibility and moderation; and if the former has in some instances prevailed, it must be my excuse that it has been neither often nor much.''

''Let us now pause and ask ourselves whether, in the course of these papers, the proposed Constitution has not been satisfactorily vindicated from the aspersions thrown upon it; and whether it has not been shown to be worthy of the public approbation, and necessary to the public safety and prosperity. Every man is bound to answer these questions to himself, according to the best of his conscience and understanding, and to act agreeably to the genuine and sober dictates of his judgment. This is a duty from which nothing can give him a dispensation. 'This is one that he is called upon, nay, constrained by all the obligations that form the bands of society, to discharge sincerely and honestly. No partial motive, no particular interest, no pride of opinion, no temporary passion or prejudice, will justify to himself, to his country, or to his posterity, an improper election of the part he is to act. Let him beware of an obstinate adherence to party; let him reflect that the object upon which he is to decide is not a particular interest of the community, but the very existence of the nation; and let him remember that a majority of America has already given its sanction to the plan which he is to approve or reject.''

''I shall not dissemble that I feel an entire confidence in the arguments which recommend the proposed system to your adoption, and that I am unable to discern any real force in those by which it has been opposed. I am persuaded that it is the best which our political situation, habits, and opinions will admit, and superior to any the revolution has produced.''

''Concessions on the part of the friends of the plan, that it has not a claim to absolute perfection, have afforded matter of no small triumph to its enemies. &quot;Why,&quot; say they, &quot;should we adopt an imperfect thing? Why not amend it and make it perfect before it is irrevocably established?&quot; This may be plausible enough, but it is only plausible. In the first place I remark, that the extent of these concessions has been greatly exaggerated. They have been stated as amounting to an admission that the plan is radically defective, and that without material alterations the rights and the interests of the community cannot be safely confided to it. This, as far as I have understood the meaning of those who make the concessions, is an entire perversion of their sense. No advocate of the measure can be found, who will not declare as his sentiment, that the system, though it may not be perfect in every part, is, upon the whole, a good one; is the best that the present views and circumstances of the country will permit; and is such an one as promises every species of security which a reasonable people can desire.''

''I answer in the next place, that I should esteem it the extreme of imprudence to prolong the precarious state of our national affairs, and to expose the Union to the jeopardy of successive experiments, in the chimerical pursuit of a perfect plan. I never expect to see a perfect work from imperfect man. The result of the deliberations of all collective bodies must necessarily be a compound, as well of the errors and prejudices, as of the good sense and wisdom, of the individuals of whom they are composed. The compacts which are to embrace thirteen distinct States in a common bond of amity and union, must as necessarily be a compromise of as many dissimilar interests and inclinations. How can perfection spring from such materials?''

''The reasons assigned in an excellent little pamphlet lately published in this city, are unanswerable to show the utter improbability of assembling a new convention, under circumstances in any degree so favorable to a happy issue, as those in which the late convention met, deliberated, and concluded. I will not repeat the arguments there used, as I presume the production itself has had an extensive circulation. It is certainly well worthy the perusal of every friend to his country. There is, however, one point of light in which the subject of amendments still remains to be considered, and in which it has not yet been exhibited to public view. I cannot resolve to conclude without first taking a survey of it in this aspect.''

''It appears to me susceptible of absolute demonstration, that it will be far more easy to obtain subsequent than previous amendments to the Constitution. The moment an alteration is made in the present plan, it becomes, to the purpose of adoption, a new one, and must undergo a new decision of each State. To its complete establishment throughout the Union, it will therefore require the concurrence of thirteen States. If, on the contrary, the Constitution proposed should once be ratified by all the States as it stands, alterations in it may at any time be effected by nine States. Here, then, the chances are as thirteen to nine in favor of subsequent amendment, rather than of the original adoption of an entire system.''

''This is not all. Every Constitution for the United States must inevitably consist of a great variety of particulars, in which thirteen independent States are to be accommodated in their interests or opinions of interest. We may of course expect to see, in any body of men charged with its original formation, very different combinations of the parts upon different points. Many of those who form a majority on one question, may become the minority on a second, and an association dissimilar to either may constitute the majority on a third. Hence the necessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to compose the whole, in such a manner as to satisfy all the parties to the compact; and hence, also, an immense multiplication of difficulties and casualties in obtaining the collective assent to a final act. The degree of that multiplication must evidently be in a ratio to the number of particulars and the number of parties.''

''But every amendment to the Constitution, if once established, would be a single proposition, and might be brought forward singly. There would then be no necessity for management or compromise, in relation to any other point no giving nor taking. The will of the requisite number would at once bring the matter to a decisive issue. And consequently, whenever nine, or rather ten States, were united in the desire of a particular amendment, that amendment must infallibly take place. There can, therefore, be no comparison between the facility of affecting an amendment, and that of establishing in the first instance a complete Constitution.''

''In opposition to the probability of subsequent amendments, it has been urged that the persons delegated to the administration of the national government will always be disinclined to yield up any portion of the authority of which they were once possessed. For my own part I acknowledge a thorough conviction that any amendments which may, upon mature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the organization of the government, not to the mass of its powers; and on this account alone, I think there is no weight in the observation just stated. I also think there is little weight in it on another account. The intrinsic difficulty of governing thirteen States at any rate, independent of calculations upon an ordinary degree of public spirit and integrity, will, in my opinion constantly impose on the national rulers the necessity of a spirit of accommodation to the reasonable expectations of their constituents. But there is yet a further consideration, which proves beyond the possibility of a doubt, that the observation is futile. It is this that the national rulers, whenever nine States concur, will have no option upon the subject. By the fifth article of the plan, the Congress will be obliged &quot;on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the States (which at present amount to nine), to call a convention for proposing amendments, which shall be valid, to all intents and purposes, as part of the Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the States, or by conventions in three fourths thereof.&quot; The words of this article are peremptory. The Congress &quot;shall call a convention.&quot; Nothing in this particular is left to the discretion of that body. And of consequence, all the declamation about the disinclination to a change vanishes in air. Nor however difficult it may be supposed to unite two thirds or three fourths of the State legislatures, in amendments which may affect local interests, can there be any room to apprehend any such difficulty in a union on points which are merely relative to the general liberty or security of the people. We may safely rely on the disposition of the State legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority.''

''If the foregoing argument is a fallacy, certain it is that I am myself deceived by it, for it is, in my conception, one of those rare instances in which a political truth can be brought to the test of a mathematical demonstration. Those who see the matter in the same light with me, however zealous they may be for amendments, must agree in the propriety of a previous adoption, as the most direct road to their own object.''

''The zeal for attempts to amend, prior to the establishment of the Constitution, must abate in every man who is ready to accede to the truth of the following observations of a writer equally solid and ingenious: &quot;To balance a large state or society Usays hee, whether monarchical or republican, on general laws, is a work of so great difficulty, that no human genius, however comprehensive, is able, by the mere dint of reason and reflection, to effect it. The judgments of many must unite in the work; experience must guide their labor; time must bring it to perfection, and the feeling of inconveniences must correct the mistakes which they INEVITABLY fall into in their first trials and experiments.&quot; These judicious reflections contain a lesson of moderation to all the sincere lovers of the Union, and ought to put them upon their guard against hazarding anarchy, civil war, a perpetual alienation of the States from each other, and perhaps the military despotism of a victorious demagoguery, in the pursuit of what they are not likely to obtain, but from time and experience. It may be in me a defect of political fortitude, but I acknowledge that I cannot entertain an equal tranquillity with those who affect to treat the dangers of a longer continuance in our present situation as imaginary. A nation, without a national government, is, in my view, an awful spectacle. The establishment of a Constitution, in time of profound peace, by the voluntary consent of a whole people, is a prodigy, to the completion of which I look forward with trembling anxiety. I can reconcile it to no rules of prudence to let go the hold we now have, in so arduous an enterprise, upon seven out of the thirteen States, and after having passed over so considerable a part of the ground, to recommence the course. I dread the more the consequences of new attempts, because I know that powerful individuals, in this and in other States, are enemies to a general national government in every possible shape.'' 

''PUBLIUS.''

===Analysis===
This Federalist Paper serves as a conclusion to the series that advocated the ratification of the Constitution.

The 4016 contains 4 analogue bilateral switches, each with an active-high enable input (A) and two input/outputs (X and Y). When the enable input is asseted (high), the X and Y terminals are connected by a low impedance; this is the ''on'' condition. When the enable is low, there is a high impedance path between X and Y, and the switch is ''off''.

The [[Practical Electronics/IC/4066|4066]] is pin-compatible with the 4016, but has a significantly lower ''on'' impedance and more constant ''on'' resistance over the full range of input voltage. Therefore, the 4066 is preferable to the 4016 in most cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here you learn more about the body in German.

If you have got a pain in the arm, you say:

*Ich habe Schmerzen im Arm
*Mein Arm tut weh
*Mein Arm schmerzt
*Ich habe Armschmerzen
*Ich habe Armbeschwerden

The little children are often saying:

*Ich habe Aua im Arm

}}

Many people do not know what a Swan chair look like. Its time to open up the internet browser and search for images. Or if you have an actual Swan chair with you, your lucky. You can look at a real model while modeling. This would simplify decisions and remove the need for guessing certain details that you are not available with image searches alone.

==Knowing our model==

We need to know what we are modeling look like. You can't do this without references to guide you. A simple image search with Google would provide you the references you need.

Gather several images that gives you different views of the chair. A front and a side view is great to use as a background image to guide as while modeling. Also, gather at least one image that shows the chair at an oblique angle so that it will provide a much more &quot;3d&quot; view. This will shows more clearly the shape of the chair, more than the front and side view alone would give you.

==Loop study==

Take time to study the model. For simple models like this, it would be quite quick, especially with experience. For this project, the loops are as shown bellow.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:ChairtutorialPreperationLoopStudy.png|496px]]|2=Swan chair's loops}}

The pink loop goes around the edge of the chair defining the chair's edges and thickness. The light green, light blue and light purple loops follows and create the form of the chair. The crossing green loops forms the bottom of the chair. The light blue and green loops contribute for the form of the &quot;wings&quot;, while the purple and green loops form the back. Its a simple loop structure, its topologically (sorry for using the term) the same as this cube extruded to form a T (upside down so the loops would match more).

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:TPieceLoops.png|570px]]|2=The T shape piece loops}}

While modeling keep these loops in mind and try to achieve the loops. For this project, the loops are achieved with simple extrusions of a cube, just like the T piece above, but in a form that looks more like the chair.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[:w:Heat|Heat]]''' is the process of energy transfer from one body or system due to thermal contact, which in turn is defined as an energy transfer to a body in any other way than due to work performed on the body.

To find the total of received heat (Q), the formula is:

&lt;math&gt;\!Q=\!m\times\!c\times\Delta\!t&lt;/math&gt;

With the term :

* Q = the total of received heat (Joule, Kilojoule, Megajoule, Calorie, Kilocalorie)
* m = mass of substances (Gram, Kilogram)
* c = conductivity of substances (Joule/kilogram°C, Joule/gram°C, Calorie/gram°C)
* Δt = differences of temperature (°C)

==Exercises==
# A tungsten with the mass 600 grams heated from the temperature 25°C to 85°C. If the conductivity of the tungsten is 0,18 cal/gram°C, find the received heat of tungsten!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The number of young men who enlisted in The Great War was phenomenal.  This was due primarily to Australia's loyalty to 'Mother England'. Although Australia did not have many troops to give Britain, it certainly gave all it could in the way of primary produce and other vital supplies in 1914.

To begin with, fewer men returned than those who decided to join up. The first World War impacted Australia economically, politically, socially, and culturally until the big stock market crash.

Australia started to feel the Depressions effect because they couldn`t sell primary products so the supplies were high and demands were low because of the stock market crash in 1929.

And nobody could afford to buy the primary products such as wheat, wool, and minerals because everybody used up their shares and stock which made people poor.  Their stocks and shares were sold before they were useless, they could not be paid, and they had to dismiss people from work. With fewer jobs, the people who couldn`t afford housing lived on the street.

After woulds all the world felt the Depression.

Maybe it should be copied to the the page?

== some Gimp notes ==

Opening the initial image before opening the rest as layers is an unnecessary step.  Gimp's &quot;open as layers&quot; will work just as well without having a document open to start with.

Repeating the &quot;open as layers&quot; for each image is also unnecessary, even if you're not choosing to open all.  Ctrl + click will select specific images within a directory, and Shift + click will select a contiguous block of files.

&quot;Filters-&gt;Animation-&gt;Optimize for GIF&quot; is a valuable step for reducing the size of your file, as it removes pixels that are reused in sequential frames.  This step creates a copy of the file.

GIF files use an indexed color palette, so it's handy to convert to indexed (Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;Indexed) before saving the animation.  This is not necessary, since Gimp automatically does a conversion when saving as GIF, but doing the conversion yourself gives greater control of how the conversion is done.  You can set the number of colors to use as well as the dithering method, and if it ends up too crunchy just undo and try again with different settings.

== better ways than gimp ==

May be there exists another article for that but would it not be better to use ImageMagick (Windows and Linux) to do the job instead of gimp? 

e.g.: convert -delay 5 *.png out.gif

=Introduction=


Here, we discuss the most fundamental aspects of structural analysis.  The approach is intended to be as general as possible, distant from loads, material properties, bolts and nuts, yet essential to the practical work of the structural analyst.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The core of the discussion is safety and reliability, and how to achieve those qualities regardless of what the application may be.

= Introduction =

The physical nature of engineering materials can be described by a set of measurable properties. This chapter defines these measures and discusses their implications in a broad sense. It also covers Material Science, i.e. the science of producing materials with intended properties, and outlines different types of engineering materials and their characteristic qualities. Later in the book, some of these matters will be further investigated by the powerful theories of Continuum Mechanics, FEM etc., which will bring a much more potent and general understanding of solid materials.

=Introduction=

We define ''Failure Mode'' as a possible condition where an engineering structure fails to operate as intended.  This includes different forms of material failure, excessive vibrations and deformations.

The covered failure modes are discussed in great detail.  Related mechanisms, analysis methods, failure criteria, environmental influences, material aspects etc. are covered extensively.
