==1. Define what &quot;soil&quot; means?==
Soil is the naturally occurring, unconsolidated or loose covering of broken rock particles and decaying organic matter (humus) on the surface of the Earth, capable of supporting life.  In simple terms, soil has three components: solid, liquid, and gas. The solid phase is a mixture of mineral and organic matter. Soil particles pack loosely, forming a soil structure filled with voids. The solid phase occupies about half of the soil volume. The remaining void space contains water (liquid) and air (gas). Soil is also known as ''earth'': it is the substance from which our planet takes its name.

==2. Where on earth is all soil located?==
Soil on the Earth is located only on its surface to a depth of about {{units|1.5 meters|60 inches}}.

==3. What are 5 key factors in soil formation?==
;Climate: Climate is the average and variations of weather in a region over long periods of time.   It affects soil formation in that it provides the forces (water, wind, etc.) necessary to erode rock into soil.
;Organisms: Organisms are living creatures (including plants, animals, fungi, etc.).  Organisms are active agents of soil formation, providing organic soil components or converting it into soil.
;Terrain: Terrain is used as a general term in physical geography, referring to the lie of the land. This is usually expressed in terms of the elevation, slope, and orientation of terrain features. Terrain affects surface water flow and distribution. 
;Parent material: Parent material means the underlying geological material (generally bedrock or a superficial or drift deposit) in which soil horizons form. Soils typically get a great deal of structure and minerals from their parent material. Parent materials are made up of consolidated or unconsolidated mineral material that has undergone some degree of physical or chemical weathering.
;Time: All of the forces that create soil require time in which to operate.  When leaves fall from trees, they are not instantly converted into soil.  Similarly, erosion is a process that occurs over time.

==4. Define the following terms:==
[[Image:Soil profile.png|thumb|220px|right|Soil Horizons]]
;a. A-Horizon: The A Horizon is the top layer of the soil horizon. The technical definition of an A Horizon may vary, but it is most commonly described in terms relative to deeper layers. A Horizons may be darker in color than deeper layers and contain more organic material, or they may be lighter but contain less clay or sesquioxides. The A is a surface horizon, and as such is also known as the zone in which most biological activity occurs. Soil organisms such as worms, nematodes, fungi, and many species of bacteria is concentrated here, often in close association with plant roots. Thus the A-horizon may be referred to as the &quot;biomantle&quot;. However, since biological activity extends far deeper into the soil, it cannot be used as a chief distinguishing feature of an A Horizon.
;b. B-Horizon: B Horizons are commonly referred to as ‘subsoil’, and consist of mineral layers which may contain concentrations of clay or minerals such as iron or aluminium, or organic material. In addition, they are defined by having a distinctly different structure or consistence to the A horizon above and the horizons below. They may also have ‘stronger’ colours (i.e. higher chroma) than the A horizon.
;c. C-Horizon: C Horizons are simply named so because they come ‘after’ A and B within the soil profile. These layers are little affected by soil forming processes, and their lack of pedological development is one of their defining attributes. C Horizons may contain lumps of unweathered rock, rather than being comprised solely of small fragments as in the solum. ‘Ghost’ rock structure may be present within these horizons.
;d. Organic layer: The upper soil horizons containing mostly organic matter.
;e. Mineral layer: The lower soil horizons containing little organic matter.
;f. Clay: Soil composed primarily of fine-grained minerals, which show plasticity through a variable range of water content, and which can be hardened when dried and/or fired.
;g. Leaching: Leaching is the loss of mineral and organic solutes due to percolation. It is a mechanism of soil formation.
;h. Silica: Silica is the chemical compound silicon dioxide, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is most commonly found in nature as sand or quartz.
;i. Humus: Humus refers to any organic matter which has reached a point of stability, where it will break down no further and might, if conditions do not change, remain essentially as it is for centuries, if not millennia
;j. Soil Profile: The different soil horizons stacked one atop the other makes up the soil profile.
;k. Parent Material:  The rock from which mineral soil components was formed.
;l. Pedologist:  A pedologist is a scientist who studies soil in its natural environment.

==5. Define the term &quot;Soil Classification&quot;. Why are soils classified?==
Soil classification deals with the systematic categorization of soils based on distinguishing characteristics as well as criteria that dictate choices in use.

Soil classification is a dynamic subject, from the structure of the system itself, to the definitions of classes, and finally in the application in the field. Soil classification can be approached from the perspective of soil as a material and soil as a resource.

For soil resources, experience has shown that a natural system approach to classification, i.e. grouping soils by their intrinsic property (soil morphology), behavior, or genesis, results in classes that can be interpreted for many diverse uses.

Criteria are designed to guide choices in land use and soil management.

==6. Discuss three differences between the following soil types:==
===a. Desert===
Aridisols (or desert soils) are a soil order in USA soil taxonomy. Aridisols (from the Latin aridus, for “dry”) form in an arid or semi-arid climate. Aridisols dominate the deserts and xeric shrublands which occupy about one third of the Earth's land surface. Aridisols have a very low concentration of organic matter. Water deficiency is the major defining characteristic of Aridisols. Also required is sufficient age to exhibit sub-soil weathering and development. Imperfect leaching in Aridisols often results in one or more subsurface soil horizons in which suspended or dissolved minerals have been deposited: silicate clays, sodium, calcium carbonate, gypsum or soluble salts. These subsoil horizons can also be cemented by carbonates, gypsum or silica. Accumulation of salts on the surface can result in salinization.

===b. Temperate===
Brown earths are mostly located between 30° and 55° north of the Equator. The largest expanses cover western and central Europe, large areas of western and trans-Uralian Russia, the east coast of America and eastern Asia. Here, areas of brown earth soil types are found particularly in Japan, the Koreas, China, eastern Australia and New Zealand. 

They generally have three horizons: the A, B and C horizon. Horizon A is usually a brownish colour, and over 20 cm in depth. It is composed of mull humus (well decomposed alkaline organic matter) and mineral matter. It is biologically active with many soil organisms and plant roots mixing the mull humus with mineral particles. As a result, the boundary between the A and B horizons can be ill defined in unploughed examples. Horizon B is mostly composed of mineral matter which has been weathered from the parent material, but it often contains inclusions of more organic material carried in by organisms, especially earthworms. It is lighter in colour than the A horizon, and is often weakly illuviated (leached). Due to limited leaching only the more soluble bases are moved down through the profile. Horizon C is made up of the parent material, which is generally permeable and non- or slightly acidic, for example clay loam.

===c. Tropical===
Oxisols are an order in USDA soil taxonomy, best known for their occurrence in tropical rain forest, 15-25 degrees north and south of the Equator. Some oxisols have been previously classified as laterite soils.

The main processes of soil formation of oxisols are weathering, humification and pedoturbation due to animals. These processes produce the characteristic soil profile. They are defined as soils containing at all depths no more than 10 percent weatherable minerals, and low cation exchange capacity. Oxisols are always a red or yellowish color, due to the high concentration of iron(III) and aluminium oxides and hydroxides. In addition they also contain quartz and kaolin, plus small amounts of other clay minerals and organic matter.

The word &quot;oxisol&quot; comes from &quot;oxide&quot; in reference to the dominance of oxide minerals such as bauxite. In the FAO soil classification, oxisols are known as ferralsols.

Scientists originally thought that the heavy vegetation of tropical rain forests would provide rich nutrients, but as rainfall passes through the litter on the forest floor the rain is acidified and leaches minerals from the above soil layers. This forces plants to get their nutrition from decaying litter as oxisols are quite infertile due to the lack of organic matter and the almost complete absence of soluble minerals leached by the wet and humid climate.

==7. Examine a 2-foot vertical section of soil. Label the different types of organic matter found, identify the different soil horizons, and mark the transition from the soil layer to the mineral layer.==
Find a place where you have permission to dig a 2-foot deep hole.  In the United States, '''call before you dig'''. Digger's Hotline, One-call or Miss Utility are services that allow construction workers to contact utility companies, who will then denote where underground utilities are located via color-coding those locations. As required by law and assigned by the FCC, the 8-1-1 telephone number will soon be used for this purpose across the United States.

Failure to call such a number ahead of time may result in a fine or even a charge against the person or company, particularly if such negligence causes a major utility outage or serious accident, or an evacuation due to a gas leak. Hitting a water main may also trigger a boil-water advisory and local flooding.

A few utilities are permanently marked with short posts or bollards, mainly for lines carrying petroleum products.

Once you have clearance, get your shovel and start the hole.  If you are lucky, perhaps someone you know is already digging a hole, and if so, ask permission to come in and make your observations.  People dig holes for all kinds of reasons: footers for building a deck, trenches for laying pipe or cable, foundation for a new building, or to add to an existing one.  But if no one you know is digging a hole, you may have to get out the shovel yourself.

You can label the required features with craft sticks and a pen.  Simply write a label on the craft stick with the pen, and insert it into the soil near the feature you wish to label.  Alternatively, you could take a photograph of the vertical section and then import it into a word processor.  Then add the labels to the photo digitally.

==8. Draw, photograph, or collect and correctly label 5 different soil types.==
Listed below are a few types of soil you might collect.  For a more complete listing of soil types, see the [[w:Category:Types of soil|Types of soil]] category in Wikipedia.
===Sandy soil===
Sandy soil consists of relatively large particles (sand).  It has a gritty texture.  Sandy soil, if mixed well with organic matter, is a good medium for growing plants as long as it is kept moist.  Because the particles are so large, water and air easily penetrate the soil and reach the roots of plants.  However, this same quality allows the water to drain away almost immediately (which is why it must be kept moist if used for agriculture).
===Silty soil===
Silty soil is like sandy soil except that it contains finer particles and more nutrients.  It has a darker color as well.  Silty soil is one of the best soils for agriculture because like sandy soil, it allows water and air to penetrate to the roots, but unlike sandy soil, it hold the water longer.

===Clay soil===
Clay soil is made of very fine particles.  While it is replete with minerals, plants may have a difficult time extracting them because clay is so impermeable.  Wet clay will clump together when wadded into a ball in the palm of the hand.
===Loamy Soil===
Loamy soil is a mixture of sand, silt, and some clay.  It is considered the ideal soil for agriculture, as it has good drainage and plenty of plant nutrients.
===Peaty Soil===
Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation matter. Peat forms in wetlands or peatlands, variously called bogs, moors, muskegs, pocosins, mires, and peat swamp forests.

Peat forms when plant material, usually in marshy areas, is inhibited from decaying fully by acidic and anaerobic conditions. It is composed mainly of marshland vegetation: trees, grasses, fungi, as well as other types of organic remains, such as insects, and animal corpses. 

Peat is soft and easily compressed. Under pressure, water in the peat is forced out. Upon drying, peat can be used as a fuel. Peat is also dug into soil to increase the soil's capacity to retain moisture and add nutrients. This makes it important agriculturally, for farmers and gardeners.

===Chalky Soil=== 
Chalky soil is highly alkaline.  It is composed primarily of the mineral calcite.  Because chalk is porous it can hold a large volume of ground water, providing a natural reservoir that releases water slowly through dry seasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''optical disk drive''' is a storage medium from which data is read and to which it is written by lasers. Optical disks can store much more data, up to 6 gigabytes (6 billion bytes), than most portable magnetic media, such as floppy disks. 

There are several basic types of optical disks:
# CD-ROM : Like audio CDs, CD-ROMs come with data already encoded onto them. The data is permanent and can be read any number of times, but CD-ROMs cannot be modified.
# WORM : Stands for write-once, read -many. With a WORM disk drive, you can write data onto a WORM disk, but only once. After that, the WORM disk behaves just like a CD-ROM.
# CD-R: Stands for Compact-Disc Recordable, which can be written to once (aside from multisession writing).  
# CD-RW: Stands for Compact-Disc Rewriteable, which behave similar to CD-R but can be erased to create a new blank disk.  
# DVD: A Digital Versatile Disc, which allows storing up to 4.7 GB. May appear as Double-Layer to contain 8.5 GB, and can even be double-sided to double the capacity once again.  
# DVD-R: A recordable version of DVDs.
# DVD-RW: A rewritable version of DVDs. 

These three technologies are not compatible with one another; each requires a different type of disk drive and disk. Even within one category, there are many competing formats, although CD-ROMs are relatively standardized.

&gt;Since the Hamiltonian is invariant with time, it represents the energy.  

Not true in general.  
It's the energy in this case, but the quoted sentence doesn't provide justification for that.
Work out &lt;math&gt;T(v)=\tfrac 1 2 v^2 + \tfrac 1 6 v^3&lt;/math&gt; sometime to see a counterexample where the Hamiltonian function isn't the same as the energy.

I have been struggling with content of the Wikibook for some months now.
Am pleased at progress.

BUT I need to look at the categorization issues.

The best move for white here is 6.Qxd4. This leads to 6.- Qxd4 7.Nxd4. This line is thougt to slight favor black.
6.Nxd4?! is bad because of 6.- c5! and after 7.Nb5 or 7.Nb3, black shall play Qxd1+!, which will give him an advantage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= the address book =
I have obtained some notes on use of Alloy for the building of models and I have
copy of Daniel Jackson's book. I propose to build new model on „Digital Art Exhibition“
which is essentially isomorphic to address book in the &quot;Whirlwind Tour&quot; (Михал Орела 13:12, 11 August 2008 (UTC))

The model has been built, encoded, and executed.
The results are very pleasing. We now have a new model isomorphic to the address book model.
(Михал Орела 18:43, 11 August 2008 (UTC))
==the code itself==
Using the inbuilt code tags gives a very ugly result.
Time to try something more sensible and elegant.
(Михал Орела 17:39, 15 August 2008 (UTC))

== the screenshot ==
The next problem to be resolved was the issue of use of a screenshot
under a suitable Wikimedia Commons License.

Fortunately, there is a special MIT License which is available; Daniel Jackson is at MIT.
The screenshot is now also incorporated. (Михал Орела 18:43, 11 August 2008 (UTC))

== white space ==
I have stuff working.
However, there is far too much white space.
The images were chosen to be roughly the same size and to be square shaped.
I might experiment a bit with the presentation... later.
(Михал Орела 19:27, 11 August 2008 (UTC))

==Alloy analyzer==
The diagrams are all produced now with
Alloy Analyzer 4.1.8 (build date: 2008/08/07 16:29 EDT)

The old line goes: 9...Nc5 10. c3 d4 11. cxd4 Nxd4. The new variation goes: 11.Ng5!? Qxg5. Black is thought to equalize in both lines.

== The {{tlx|New book}} Template ==

Hello Kkmane, how are you? I noticed you removed the {{tlx|New book}} template form the [[Easyfoss]] book. That template should really remain on the book for at least a week (and typically much more). It helps your book to appear in the list at [[Template:New]], which is included in a number of high-traffic pages. Basically, it's free advertising, it helps to attract new contributors and new readers to the project. It also helps to ensure that the book becomes properly categorized, so nothing gets lost. 

I put the template back on the book for now. If you have any questions about this, please let me know. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:05, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
This section is for advanced learners with an expert level of Korean.

==각다분하다==
tiresome: 일을 해 나가기가 고되고 힘들다 (하루 종일 운전하려니 '''각다분하다'''.)
 
==구성지다==
graceful: 천연스럽고 구수하며 멋지다 (할아버지의 '''구성진''' 노랫가락을 들어 봐라.)
 
==초름하다==
insufficient: 충분하지 못하거나 조금 부족하다 (여비가 좀 '''초름하니까''' 아껴 쓰자.)
 
==어금버금하다==
hardly different: 서로 엇비슷해서 차이가 별로 없다 (우리는 '''어금버금한''' 실력이다.)
 
==가직하다==
near: 거리가 조금 가깝다 (멀리 가지 말고 '''가직한''' 곳에서 놀아라.)
 
==다붓하다==
close: 사이가 멀지 않다, 조용하고 호젓하다 ('''다붓하게''' 떨어져 있다.)
 
==덧거칠다==
go wrong: 일이 잘못되어 가다 (아무리 애를 써 봐도 사업은 '''덧거칠어만''' 갔다.)
 
==간동하다==
잘 정돈되어 홀가분하다 (방을 간동하게 정리했다.)
 
==덜퍽지다==
매우 넉넉하고 탐스럽다 (소쿠리에 귤을 덜퍽지게 담아 왔다.)
 
==시뜻하다==
탐탁하지 않거나 싫증이 난 듯하다 (시뜻한 표정으로 상을 물리었다.)
 
==가무리다==
몰래 감춰 두다, 몰래 혼자 차지하다 (문갑에 가무려 둔 통장을 꺼냈다.)
 
==잡도리하다==
일이 어긋나지 않도록 단속하다 (기밀이 새지 않도록 잡도리했다.)
 
==그들먹히다==
거의 그득하다 (물통에 물이 그들먹하게 찼다)
 
==숙수그레하다==
여러 개의 크기가 고르다 (정원에 심은 묘목들이 숙수그레하다.)
 
==암팡지다==
체구는 작아도 야무지고 당차다 (내 동생은 초등학생이지만 참 암팡지다.)
 
==우두망찰하다==
갑자기 일을 당해 정신없이 어쩔 줄 몰라 하다 (엄마는 그런 상태에서 느끼는 어떤 위기의식과 이웃으로부터의 따돌림으로 늘 우두망찰한 표정을 짓고 있을 뿐, 이래라저래라 자기 의견을 말하지 않았다.)
 
==가탈==
이리저리 트집을 잡아 까다롭게 구는 일 (페루 음식에 대한 심한 가탈로 석철은 쿠즈코에서 쫓겨났다.)
 
==깜냥==
스스로 일을 판단할 수 있는 능력 (제 깜냥엔, 외무고시 1차를 통과한 자신이 자랑스러웠다.)

==달포==
한 달이 약간 넘는 기간 (그 후 석철은 거의 달포나 MSN에 로그인 하지 않았다.)

==선잠==
깊이 들지 못하고 살짝 드는 잠. (시험을 앞두고 긴장을 한 탓인지 간밤에는 내내 선잠만 잤다.)

==헤살==
짓궂게 남의 일을 방해함. 또는 그런 짓. (여교수는 석철이 하는 일마다 짓게 헤살을 놓았다.)
 
==고갱이==
식물 줄기의 가운데 위치한 연한 부분, 사물의 핵심이 되는 부분 (한 민족의 문화와 정신을 이해하는 고갱이는 말이다.)
 
==어깃장==
일부러 다른 사람의 일이 어긋나도록 하는 말이나 행동 (순순히 협조하는 것 같더니 차츰 어깃장을 놓기 시작했다.)
 
==화수분==
재물이 계속해서 쏟아져 나오는 보물단지. (넌 내가 무슨 화수분인 줄 아니? 어째 나만 보면 돈 얘기냐!)
 
==생때같다==
통 병이 없을 정도로 몸이 튼튼하고 건강하다. (생때같던 사람이 하룻밤 사이에 갑자스럽게 세상을 세상을 떠 버렸다.)
 
==속절없다==
단념하는 것 외에는 달리 마땅한 방법이 없다. (아무리 기다려도 그녀는 어지 않고, 나는 속절없이 담배만 피워 댔다.)
 
==수더분하다==
성질이 까다롭지 않고 순하고 소박하다. (모름지기 사람이란 수더분하고 어수룩한 맛이 있어야 한다.)
 
==애달프다==
마음이 쓰리거나 몹시 안타깝다. (남편을 지척에 두고 만나지 못하는 애달픈 마음이야 오죽하겠는가.)
 
==올곧다==
정신 상태나 마음이 올바르고 곧다. 줄이 바르다. (한평생을 한눈팔지 않고 자기의 길만을 올곧게 걸어온 사람이다.)
 
==옹골지다==
속이 꽉 차 있어서 실속이 있다. (겉으로 자리 보여도 살림 하나는 옹골지게 잘하는 여편네다.)
 
==하릴없다==
달리 어쩔 도리가 없다. 조금도 틀림이 없다. (비를 맞으며 문 앞에 쭈그리고 있는 그의 모습은 하릴없는 거지였다.)
 
==여북==
얼마나, 오죽의 뜻을 나타내며, 언짢거나 안타까움을 드러냄 (아, 여북 답답했으면 내가 이러겠어?)
 
==적이==
약간, 얼마간 (적이 안심이 되는 한편 더욱 더 착잡해지고 하는 듯한 두 개의 얼국이 수시로 변덕을 부리며 엇갈리고 있었다.)
 
==짐짓==
마음은 그렇지 않으면서 일부러 (그것이 사랑에서 즐겨 찾는 국거리인 줄 번연히 알면서도 짐짓 그렇게 묻는 거였다.)
 
==되우==
매우 몹시 (누나는 이 말에 되우 놀라며 눈을 말똥말똥 떴다.)
 
==무릇==
대체적으로 보아 (부모가 물려주는 거만의 유산은 무릇 불행을 낳기 쉽다.)
 
==섬뻑==
어떤 일이 행해진 뒤 곧바로 (혹시 내가 말을 너무 까다롭게 내기 때문에 섬뻑 대답이 안 나왔거나 그랬겠지요.)
 
==얼추==
대충, 대강 (일이 얼추 끝나 가는 것 같군.)
 
==좀체==
여간해서, 쉽사리 (그는 좀체 입을 열지 않는 성격이다.)
 
==길래==
오래도록 (계양산에 가서 길래 계실 터인가요?)
 
==노상==
늘 같은 모양으로 (김 장자는 자나 깨나 노상 그 아들로 하여 은근히 걱정 중이겠다.)
 
==사뭇==
거리낌 없이 전혀 딴판으로 사무칠 정도로 몹시, 줄곧 (그의 기분은 아까 오전과는 사뭇 달라 보였다.)
 
==자못==
생각보다 훨씬 더 (마을 친척들도 명식의 경솔한 언도이 자못 불쾌한 모양이었다.)
 
==잼처==
어떤 일에 바로 뒤이어 거듭. (어해가 어리둥절하고 미처 대답 못하는 것을 보고 그 여자는 잼처 묻는다.)
 
==객쩍다==
언행이나 생각이 쓸데없고 싱겁다 (객쩍은 소리 그만 두어요. 그따위 실업는 소리를 할 때가 아니에요.)
 
==발자하다==
성미가 급하다 (발자하게 새새거리며 날뛰는 겨애보다 은근하고 깊이가 있어 보여서)
 
==살핏하다==
짜거나 엮은 것이 다소 거칠고 성기다

==해사하다==
낯빛이 희고 말쑥하다 (해사하게 생긴 그 얼굴 모습과 같이 명쾌한 가운데도 안존하고 순편한 편이요.)

==괄괄하다==
성격이 드세고 급하다 (성미가 괄괄하고 입심이 좋기 때문에 양반의 글방에를 다닐 때도 누구한테나 결코 만만하게는 보이지 않았다.)

==애잔하다==
가날프고 약하다, 몹시 애틋하고 애처롭다 (대불이는 마음속으로 형님도 벌써 늙었구나 하고 생각하면서 애잔한 눈빛으로 마주 보았다.)

==음전하다==
얌전하고 우아하다 (금개의 말하는 태도는 그대로 음전하고 순박했다.)

==데데하다==
몹시 볍변치 못하여 보잘것없다 (그렇게 데데한 남자를 얻다 써먹어.)

==머쓱하다==
무안을 당해 어색하고 열없다 (사내가 물러가자 나는 오히려 머쓱한 기분이 들었다.)

==추레하다==
겉모습이 보잘것없고 궁상스럽다 (달수의 그런 추레한 꼴을 본 사람들은 경멸에 앞서 동정을 보냈다.)

==곰살스럽다==
얼굴 따위가 얌전하고 고와 보이다 (그녀의 목소리는 곱살스러웠다.)

==데퉁스럽다==
언행이 거칠고 엉뚱하여 미련스러운 데가 있다 (데퉁스럽게 대답했다.)

==든적스럽다==
행동에 치사하고 더러운 데가 있다 (두 어른께서 날 홀대하고 수치스럽고 든적스럽게 여기신다 한들 딴 도리가 없습니다.)

==영절스럽다==
보기에 아주 그럴듯하다 (그 화가는 도시의 전경을 영절스럽게 묘사하였다.)

==갸웃하다==
무엇을 이상하게 여기며 머리나 몸을 한쪽으로 비스듬히 기울이다 (그녀는 한패를 돌아다모면서 고개를 갸웃했다.)

==도두보다==
실제보다 좋게 보다 (제 것이면 도두보고 남의 것은 깔보려 하는 것이 인간의 숙명적인 성격인가 보다.)

==바루다==
안절부절못하다 (잘못된 것을 바루었다.)

A '''''Bouquet garni''''' or '''Herb Bouquet''' is a combination of 
*parsley 
*thyme
*bay leaf 

which are tied in a bunch and used in flavouring sauces, stews, soups, casseroles and other dishes. Sometimes other ingredients are added such as:

*peppercorns 
*celery or celery seed 
*fennel seed 
*coriander seed
*cloves
*garlic  

In the latter case, or if dried herbs are used,  the aromatics are tied up in a piece of cheesecloth with a length of string that can be tied to the handle of the cooking vessel. Later the string can be used to retrieve and discard the bag.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Child (1961), ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'', Alfred A. Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This manual was developed specifically for freshmen students taking up their first course in programming, but people who are interested in learning C are also welcome to study it. Its aim is to supplement classroom lectures by focusing on C programming. Topics are arranged based on the order of class discussion. 

Aside from changes in programming language and presentation, additional sections have been included. Some frequently asked questions and common programming errors are listed at the end of the chapter. 

Only a subset of the ANSI C language is tackled here. Specifically, it is assumed that the student will be working under the Linux environment and programming using GNU C (which supports ANSI C)or the Borland Turbo C/C++ compiler under the Windows environment. Coding standards to be followed, as well as some pointers when programming using the Linux environment, are also included. 

May you learn a lot from the study of this manual, and may the knowledge that you have gained be used for the common good of all people.  


Sincerely yours,

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Art in the Making==
The impact of the digital computer in the twentieth century is so great that the computer has become a vital component in our society. It has practically touched every aspect of our lives. it helps us in our business transactions, keeps track of products' inventories, diagnoses heart conditions, recognizes speech patterns, and provides entertainment through games, among a hundred other applications. Its impact is so great that it has revolutionized our society and made us re-examine certain basic assumptions about our own role in the universe. Computers have evolved from a scientific curiosity to an indispensable tool in virtually all areas of our lives. 

However true it is that computers can solve problems efficiently and accurately and how sophisticated    it can be, it still cannot think for itself -- it cannot solve problems on its own. It is the human being who understands, thinks and solves problems on its own and who gives correct instruction that directs the computer to solve problems. The set or list of instructions that directs the computer on its operations is called a ''computer program''. The person who develops a program is called a ''programmer''. The act of developing a program is called ''programming''. 

Computer programming is not just plainly listing down lengthy steps to be communicated to the computer. It is not a matter of &quot;just write anything and make it run&quot;. The programmer must learn to put his logic and his creativity to make his work a masterpiece. Computer programming needs to be an art!

==Problem Analysis==

If we are to use the computer as a problem-solving tool, then we must have a good analysis of the problem given. Here are some suggested steps on how to go about analyzing a certain problem for computer application:

1. Review the problem carefully and understand what you are asked to do. 

2. Determine what information is given(input) and what result must be produced(output). 

3. Assign names to each input and output items. 

4. Determine the manner of processing that must be done on the input data to come up with the desired output(i.e., determine what formulas are needed to manipulate the given data). 


'''''Example'''''

Given the scores for the two departmental quizzes, two machine projects, final exam, and teacher's evaluation, write a program that will compute for the final grade based on the following computation:


  50% Average of two departmental quizzes
 +15% average of 2 machine projects 
 +30% Final exam
 +5%  Teacher's evaluation

Second book of the new testement of our lord Jesus Christ. The holy gospel according to Mark. Chapter One


# The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
# It is written in Isaiah the prophet: &quot;I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way&quot;--  
# &quot;a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.&quot; ''The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God''.   
# And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.  
# The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.  
# John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.  
# And this was his message: &quot;After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.  
# I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.&quot;  
# At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  
# As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.

==Notes==
* The text ''abkai ejen i jui Isus Hristos i ewanggelinuma i deribun oho'' in italics appears at the end of 1:3 in the Manchu version as opposed to 1:1 in the King James version of the bible. In the text and translation I have included it twice: in italics where it isn't in the original and in normal font where it is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Favorite Coding standard and Guidelines=
Please when making changes try to apply the standards to any surrounding code. This is especially true of comments and variable naming.

==Indentation and Spacing==
'''Braces'''
*Braces shall follow &quot;Extended Style&quot;.
**The Extended Bracing Style means that the curly brace pair are lined up with the surrounding statement. Statements and declarations between the braces are indented relative to the braces.
*Braces shall be indented 2 columns to the right of the starting position of the enclosing statement or declaration.
*Loop and conditional statements shall always have brace enclosed sub-statements.
**The code looks more consistent if all conditional and loop statements have braces.&lt;br&gt;Even if there is only a single statement after the condition or loop statement today, there might be a need for more code in the future.
*Braces without any contents or a single statement may be placed on the same line.

'''Lines'''
*Use blank lines to improve readability.
**They separate blocks of code which are in themselves logically related.
*Lines shall not exceed 79 characters.
**Even if your editor handles long lines, other people may have set up their editors differently. Long lines in the code may also cause problems for other programs and printers.
*Each statement shall be placed on a line on its own.
**There is no need to make code compact. Putting several statements on the same line only makes the code cryptic to read.

'''Spaces'''
*No space between a function name and the parenthesis &quot; (&quot; starting its parameter list.
*All binary arithmetic, bitwise and assignment operators and the ternary conditional operator (?:) shall be surrounded by spaces; the comma operator shall be followed by a space but not preceded; all other operators shall not be used with spaces.
*Do not use tabs.
**Tabs make the source code difficult to read where different programs treat the tabs differently. The same code can look very differently in different views.&lt;br&gt;Avoid using tabs in your source code to avoid this problem. Use spaces instead.

==Entity Naming==
*Entity naming shall be done in English.
**Enables internationalization of the code.
*Use sensible, descriptive names.
**Do not use short cryptic names or names based on internal jokes. It shall be easy to type a name without looking up how it is spelt.&lt;br&gt;Exception: Loop variables and variables with a small scope (less than 20 lines) may have short names to save space if the purpose of that variable is obvious.
*Only use English names.
**It is confusing when mixing languages for names. English is the preferred language because of its spread in the software market and because most libraries used already use English.
*Variables with a large scope shall have long names, variables with a small scope can have short names.
**Scratch variables used for temporary storage or indices are best kept short. A programmer reading such variables shall be able to assume that its value is not used outside a few lines of code. Common scratch variables for integers are i, j, k, m, n and for characters c and d.
*Use namespaces for identifiers declared in different modules
**This avoids name clashes.
*Use name prefixes for identifiers declared in different modules
**This avoids name clashes.
*Function names must have first letter of every word in caps.
*Member functions should be named after actions
**Examine the contract between the member function and its client
*Name things after what they represent.
**If you can't think of what it is that is a clue you have not thought through the design well enough.
*Include Units in Names
**If it is a representation of time, weight, or some other unit then include the unit in the name so developers can more easily spot problems.

==Comments==
*Comments shall be written in English.
*Comments shall use the C++-style whenever possible but C style is possible for in a line mid code commenting and multi-line function introductory comment. (except contructors/destructors)
*All comments shall be placed above the line the comment describes, indented identically or after the code in the same line.
**Being consistent on placement of comments removes any question on what the comment refers to.
*Every class shall have a comment that describes its purpose.
*Every function should have a comment that describes its purpose.
*Constant names must always be all caps.
*Function comments should include any precondition and postcondition and side effects.
*Parameter comments must indicate change of ownership.

==Files==
*C++ source files shall have extension &quot;.c&quot;.
*C++ header files shall have extension &quot;.h&quot;.
*There should only be one externally visible class defined in each header file.
**Having as few declarations as possible in a header file reduces header dependencies.
*The header file shall have the same name as the class plus extension &quot;.h&quot;.
*External non-member functions that belong to the class interface may also be declared in the same header file.
*File names shall be treated as case sensitive.
*Files must have the &quot;#pragma once&quot; include guards.
*System header files shall be included with &lt;&gt; and project headers with &quot;&quot;.
*Put #include directives at the top of files.
**Having all #include directives in one place makes it easy to find them.
*Do not use absolute directory names in #include directives.
**The directory structure may be different on other systems.

==Declarations==
*Provide names of parameters in function declarations.
**Parameter names are useful to document what the parameter is used for.&lt;br&gt;The parameter names shall be the same in all declarations and definitions of the function.
*Use a typedef to define a pointer to a function.
**Pointers to functions have a strange syntax. The code becomes much clearer if you use a typedef for the pointer to function type. This typedef name can then be used to declare variables etc.
*Declare each item in a separate declaration.
**One declaration per line. It avoids the problem of knowing which variables are pointers.&lt;br&gt;int* p, i;&lt;br&gt;It is easy to forget that the star belongs to the declared name, not the type, and look at this and say that the type is &quot;pointer to int&quot; and both p and i are declared to this type. It also encourages commenting and it is easier to read.
*Avoid use of exception specifications.
**Exception specifications in C++ are not as useful as they look. The compiler does not make the code more efficient. On the contrary, the compiler has to insert code to check that called functions do not violate the specified exception specification at runtime.
*Declare inherited functions virtual.
**An inherited function is implicitly virtual if it is declared virtual in the base class. Repeat the virtual keyword when declaring an inherited function in a derived class to make it clear that this function is virtual.
*Do not use global using declarations and using directives in headers.
**Bringing in names from a namespace to the global namespace may cause conflicts with other headers. The author of a header does not know in which context the header is used and should avoid polluting the global namespace. Instead, only use using declarations in the source files.
*Do not use using directives.
**Bringing in names from a namespace can cause all sorts of problems as the namespace might contain more names than you would expect.
*Declare class data private.
**Classes shall encapsulate their data and only provide access to this data by member functions to ensure that data in class objects are consistent.&lt;br&gt;The exception to the rule is C type struct that only contains data members.
*Only use the keyword struct for C-style structs.
*Functions that can be implemented using public interface of a class shall not be members.
**A class definition can be kept small and less prone to change if it only defines the core functionality. Any other functions that can be implemented with this minimal class definition shall be implemented as non-member functions. They are still seen as part of the interface of the class.

==Statements==
*Never use gotos.
**Gotos break structured coding.
*All switch statements shall have a default label.
**Even if there is no action for the default label, it shall be included to show that the programmer has considered values not covered by case labels. If the case labels cover all possibilities, it is useful to put an assertion there to document the fact that it is impossible to get here. An assertion also protects from a future situation where a new possibility is introduced by mistake.

==Other==
*Avoid macros.
**Most macros can be replaced by constants, enumerations or inline functions.&lt;br&gt;As macros are not part of the C++ language, they do not provide type safety and debugger support.
*Use parentheses within macros around parameter names.
**It's generally a good idea to use extra parentheses for macro parameters, it avoids the parameters from being parsed in a unintended ways. But there are some exceptions to consider:&lt;br&gt;- Since comma operator have lower precedence than any other, this removes the possibility of problems.&lt;br&gt; - When concatenating tokens with the ## operator, converting to strings using the # operator, or concatenating adjacent string literals, parameters cannot be individually parenthesized.
*Macro replacement lists should be parenthesized.
**&quot;#define CUBE(X) (X) * (X) * (X)&quot; as &quot;#define CUBE(X) ((X) * (X) * (X))&quot;
*Do not use literal numbers other than 0 and 1.
**Use constants instead of literal numbers to make the code consistent and easy to maintain. The name of the constant is also used to document the purpose of the number.
*Check all fail point, use plenty of assertions.
**Assertions are useful to verify pre-conditions, post-conditions and any other conditions that should never happen. Pre-conditions are useful to verify that functions are called with valid arguments. They are also useful as documentation of what argument value ranges a function is designed to work with.&lt;br&gt;Assertions are macros that print error messages when the condition is not met. The macros are disabled in release mode and do not cost anything in performance or used memory in the end product. 
*Use prefix increment/decrement instead of postfix increment/decrement when the value of the variable is not used.
**For class objects there may be two different member functions for the postfix and prefix operations. The postfix operation has to keep a temporary return value of the object before changing the object. For built-in objects this does not matter as the compiler will be able to optimize away the temporary value when it is not used.&lt;br&gt;Even if this only matters for class objects, it is a good habit to use prefix increment/decrement at all times.
*Write conditional expressions like: if ( 6 == errorNum ) ...
**This style avoids accidental assignments of the variable when the comparison operator is written with only one equal sign (=).
*Use the new cast operators.
**Use dynamic_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast and static_cast instead of the traditional C cast notation. These document better what is being performed.
*Avoid use of implicit conversion to bool in conditions.

Yes, Question Writer has the option to &quot;Publish for Printing&quot; which creates an HTML document.  You can find out more about this in [[../../Save and Publish/Publish your Quiz/Publish for Printing|Publish for Printing]].

An alternative approach is to start from the other end.  If you write the questions in a Word document, you could reformat them slightly and save the document as a .txt or .rtf file then import the questions into Question Writer.  See [[../../Extras/Importing Questions/text format|Text Format]] for more details on this.

Hi there, welcome to wikibooks.  Just a note on your new book Stata.  You need to follow the [[WB:NP|naming convention]].  So the subpages need to be called Stata/Creating a DO File for example.  Let me know if you have any questions. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:53, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

Thanks.  You can move your existing pages to those locations by using the move tab at the top of the page. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:27, 13 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

== Wikijunior ==

Thanks for helping out on [[Wikijunior|Wikijunior]] [[Wikijunior:Europe|Europe]]. I've been working on the book by myself for a little while and it is nice to receive some help from someone else. I hope that you will continue to be a contributor on this book as well as other projects. If you need any help or have any questions just contact me on my talk page. --[[User:Xxagile|Xxagile]] ([[User talk:Xxagile|talk]]) 12:27, 14 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Overview ==

[[w:Zope_3|Zope 3]] consists of a number of small frameworks and libraries written in [[w:Python_Programming|Python programming language]] and it is usable in pieces or in whole.  These frameworks and libraries can be put together to build any kind of web application.  Normally, Zope 3 applications are developed using a Python based build system called [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout Buildout].  Zope 3 is built on top of a component architecture  to separate presentation code from the problem domain code and to create reusable components (''zope.component'').  

Zope 3 has an object publisher (''zope.publisher''), web server (''zope.server''), transactional object database (''ZODB''), XML-configuration language for registering components (''zope.configuration''), flexible security architecture with pluggable security policies (''zope.security''), unit and functional testing frameworks (''zope.testing'', ''zope.testbrowser''), XHTML-compliant templating language (''zope.pagetemplate''), schema engine and automatic form generation machinery (''zope.schema'', ''z3c.form'') and many more core and third-party packages.

Originally, the term ''ZOPE'' was used as an acronym for ''Z Object Publishing Environment'' (the ''Z'' doesn't really mean anything in particular).  However, now-a-days ''ZOPE'' is simply written as ''Zope''.

Zope 3 is a ZPL (BSD like, GPL compatible license) licensed free/open source software.  It was developed by the Zope community with the leadership of Jim Fulton.  A brief history is given in the next section.

The main aim of this book is to create a free online book about Zope 3.  This book will cover how to develop web applications using Zope 3 components.  You suggestions and edits are always welcome.

== Scope of the book ==

The intension of this book is not to cover how to use Zope 3 packages independently or with other Python applications/frameworks.  Rather, this book focus on developing web applications using Zope 3 packages.  More specifically, this book is not going to cover using Zope 3 technology in Zope 2, Plone, Grok or any plain Python application/framework.  WSGI is also not a current focus of this book.  This book is not going to cover using zopeproject to bootstrap application (it's very easy, look at the PyPI page for zopeproject).  This book use Buildout for setting up an isolated development environment for building applications.  Setuptools and vitualenv also will be covered.

== Audience ==

The target audience of this book are Python programmers looking for developing web applications. However, the book doesn't assume you are familiar with any other web framework.

== Prerequisites ==

This book will require prior knowledge Python programming language and at least some exposure to the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

== Brief history ==

The beginning of Zope’s story goes something like this, in 1996, Jim Fulton (CTO of Zope Corporation) was drafted to teach a class on common gateway interface (CGI) programming, despite not knowing very much about the subject. CGI programming is a commonly-used web development model that allows developers to construct dynamic websites. On his way to the class, Jim studied all the existing documentation on CGI. On the way back, Jim considered what he didn’t like about traditional, CGI-based programming environments. From these initial musings, the core of Zope was written while flying back from the CGI class.

Zope Corporation (then known as Digital Creations) went on to release three open-source software packages to support web publishing: Bobo, Document Template, and BoboPOS. These packages were written in a language called Python, and provided a web publishing facility, text templating, and an object database, respectively. Digital Creations developed a commercial application server based on their three opensource components. This product was called Principia. In November of 1998, investor Hadar Pedhazur convinced Digital Creations to open source Principia. These packages evolved into what are now the core components of Zope 2.

In 2001, the Zope community began working on a component architecture for Zope, but after several years they ended up with something much more: Zope 3. While Zope 2 was powerful and popular, Zope 3 was designed to bring web application development to the next level.  This book is about this Zope 3, which is not really a new version of Zope 2.

Most recently, in 2007 the Zope community created yet another framework based on Zope 3 called Grok. The original Zope which is now known as Zope 2 is also widely used.

== Organization of the book ==

This book has divided into multiple chapters.  Summary of each chapter is given below.

=== Introduction ===

This chapter introduce Zope 3 with an overview and scope of the book, then briefly go through the history of Zope 3.  Later discuss organization of the book.  And finish with a ''thanks'' section.

===  Getting Started ===

This chapter begins with installation details of Python and Zope 3.  Then introduce ''Buildout'', the build system we use to setup an isolated Python working environment and its configurations.  Later, it explore setting up development sandbox using Buildout.  A simple application is developed further and it ends with a ''Hello world'' page.  During the application development we see how to use ZMI (Zope Management Interface) briefly.  This chapter also provides a brief overview of important packages and installation of additional packages.

=== Interfaces ===

This chapter introduce the concept of interfaces.

== Thanks ==

This book would not be possible if Zope 3 did not exist. For that, the authors would like to thank all developers of Zope 3.  Thanks to wikibooks for providing this space for book.  Thanks to all editors of this book.

== Python installation ==

The Zope community has always recommended using a custom built Python for development and deployment. Python 2.4 is the recommended version for Zope 3, although Python 2.5 will also work, but it is not yet officially supported.

=== GNU/Linux ===

To install Python, you will be required to install gcc, g++ and other development tools in your system. A typical installation of Python can be done like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ wget -c http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.5/Python-2.4.5.tar.bz2
$ tar jxvf Python-2.4.5.tar.bz2
$ cd Python-2.4.5
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/guest/usr
$ make
$ make install
&lt;/source&gt;

As given above, you can provide an option, ''--prefix'' to install Python in a particular location.  The above steps install Python inside ''/home/guest/usr'' directory.

After installation, you can invoke the Python interpreter like this (~ is an alias to ''/home/guest''):

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ ~/usr/bin/python2.4
&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
Hello, world!
&lt;/source&gt;

{{TextBox|
If you are not getting old statements in Python interactive prompt when using up-arrow key, try installing ''libreadline'' development libraries (Hint: apt-cache search libreadline).  After installing this library, you should install Python again.  You also will be required to install ''zlib'' (Hint: apt-cache search zlib compression library) to properly install Zope 3.
}}

=== MS Windows ===

'''FIXME''': Write about installation of Python in MS Windows with few screen shots.

== Buildout ==

=== Introduction ===

We are going to use a build tool called Buildout for developing Zope 3 applications from multiple parts.  Buildout will give you an isolated working environment for developing applications.  The Buildout package, named ''zc.buildout'' is available for [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout download from PyPI].  This section briefly goes through the usage of Buildout for developing applications.

Buildout has a ''boostrap.py'' script for initializing a buildout based project for development or deployment.  It will download and install ''zc.buildout'', ''setuptools'' and other dependency modules in a specified directory.  Once bootstrapped it will create a ''buildout'' executable script inside ''bin'' directory at the top of your project source.  The default configuration for each project is ''buildout.cfg'' file at the top of your project source.  Whenever you run the ''buildout'' command it will look into the default configuration file and will do actions based on it.  Normally, the configuration file and boostrap script will be bundled with the project source itself.  Other than the default configuration file along with the project source, you may also create a system wide default configuration file at ''~/.buildout/default.cfg''.

Buildout creator Jim Fulton recommend a custom built clean Python installation, i.e., there should not be any Python modules installed in your ''site-packages'' (ideally, a fresh Python installation).  When you boostrap your project using Buildout's ''boostrap.py'' script, it will download and install all necessary packages in a specified directory.  So, for an ideal project you only required a ''custom built clean Python'' and the project source with proper ''Buildout configuration'' and ''bootstrap script'' along with the source package.

=== Buildout configuration ===

These days, most of the Python packages are available in [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs egg] format.  Buildout will download and install the eggs in directory and the location can be changed from the configuration file.  It is better to give a system-wide location for eggs directory.  And this configuration can be added to your system-wide configuration file.  The default configuration file for Buildout is ''~/.buildout/default.cfg''.  We are going to use ''eggs'' directory inside your home directory to keep all eggs downloaded, so first create those directories and file:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir .buildout
$ mkdir eggs
$ touch .buildout/default.cfg
&lt;/source&gt;

You can add the following to your ''~/.buildout/default.cfg'' file:

&lt;source lang=text&gt;
[buildout]
newest = false
eggs-directory = /home/baiju/eggs
find-links = http://download.zope.org/ppix
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''eggs-directory'' is where Buildout stores the eggs that are downloaded.  The last option, ''find-links'' points to a reliable mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPI).  The default configurations given above will be available to all buildouts in your system.

=== MS Windows notes ===

----
'''FIXME''': Add any specific things required for MS Windows here.
----

== Setting up development sandbox ==

To demonstrate the concepts, tools and techniques, we are going to develop a simple ticket/issue tracking application named ''Ticket Collector''.  To begin the work, first create a directory for the project.  After creating the directory, create a ''buildout.cfg'' file as given below.  To bootstrap this application checkout
''bootstrap.py'' and run it inside that directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ mkdir ticketcollector
$ cd ticketcollector
$ echo &quot;#Buildout configuration&quot; &gt; buildout.cfg
$ svn co svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zc.buildout/trunk/bootstrap
$ ~/usr/bin/python2.4 bootstrap/bootstrap.py
&lt;/source&gt;

You can see a ''buildout'' script created inside ''bin'' directory.  Now onwards, you can run this script when changing Buildout configuration.

{{info|
You can save ''bootstrap.py'' in a local repository.  If you are using svn for managing repository, create an svn:external to the svn URL given above.
}}

Our application is basically a Python package.  First we will create an ''src'' directory to place our package.  Inside the ''src'' directory, you can create ''ticketcollector'' Python package.  You can create the ''src'' and the ''ticketcollector'' package like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ mkdir src
$ mkdir src/ticketcollector
$ echo &quot;#Python package&quot; &gt; src/ticketcollector/__init__.py 
&lt;/source&gt;

To start building our package you have to create a ''setup.py'' file.  The ''setup.py'' should have the minimum details as given below:

We have included bare minimum packages required for installation here: ''zope.app.zcmlfiles'', ''zope.app.twisted'', ''zope.app.securitypolicy'' and ''setuptools''.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='ticketcollector',
    version='0.1',

    packages=find_packages('src'),
    package_dir={'': 'src'},
  
    install_requires=['setuptools',
                      'zope.app.zcmlfiles',
                      'zope.app.twisted',
                      'zope.app.securitypolicy',
                      ],
    include_package_data=True,
    zip_safe=False,
    )
&lt;/source&gt;

Modify ''buildout.cfg'' as given below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ini&quot;&gt;
[buildout]
develop = .
parts = py

[py]
recipe = zc.recipe.egg
eggs = ticketcollector
interpreter = python
&lt;/source&gt;

Now run ''buildout'' script inside ''bin'' directory.  This will download all necessary eggs and install it.  So installing Zope is nothing but just setting up a ''buildout'' with ''setup.py'' with required packages ''install_requires'' for installation.  Unless you specified a ''parts'' section which use ''ticketcollector'' in some way, buildout will not download dependency packages.

== A simple application ==

=== Configuring application ===


We are going to continue the ''Ticket Collector'' application in this section.  In the last section when you run ''./bin/buildout'' command all necessary Zope 3 packages required for running our application is downloaded inside ''~/eggs'' directory.  Now to run the bare minimum Zope 3, we have to create ''Zope Configuration Markup Language'' (ZCML) file and extend the ''buildout.cfg'' with appropriate Buildout recipes.  We are going to use ''zc.zope3recipes:app'',''zc.zope3recipes:instance'' and ''zc.recipe.filestorage'' recipes for setting up our application.  Here is our modified ''buildout.cfg'' (inside the ''ticketcollector'' project directory):

&lt;source lang=&quot;INI&quot;&gt;
[buildout]
develop = .
parts = ticketcollectorapp instance

[zope3]
location =

[ticketcollectorapp]
recipe = zc.zope3recipes:app
site.zcml = 
  &lt;include package=&quot;ticketcollector&quot; file=&quot;application.zcml&quot; /&gt;
eggs = ticketcollector

[instance]
recipe = zc.zope3recipes:instance
application = ticketcollectorapp
zope.conf = ${database:zconfig}

[database]
recipe = zc.recipe.filestorage
&lt;/source&gt;

Then we will create ''application.zcml'' inside ''src/ticketcollector'' directory with the following text.  Consider it as boiler plate code now, we will explain this in details later:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;configure
  xmlns=&quot;http://namespaces.zope.org/zope&quot;
  &gt;

  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.securitypolicy&quot; file=&quot;meta.zcml&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.zcmlfiles&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.authentication&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.securitypolicy&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;include package=&quot;zope.app.twisted&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;securityPolicy 
    component=&quot;zope.app.securitypolicy.zopepolicy.ZopeSecurityPolicy&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;role id=&quot;zope.Anonymous&quot; title=&quot;Everybody&quot;
    description=&quot;All users have this role implicitly&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;role id=&quot;zope.Manager&quot; title=&quot;Site Manager&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;role id=&quot;zope.Member&quot; title=&quot;Site Member&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;grant permission=&quot;zope.View&quot;
    role=&quot;zope.Anonymous&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;grant permission=&quot;zope.app.dublincore.view&quot;
    role=&quot;zope.Anonymous&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;grantAll role=&quot;zope.Manager&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;unauthenticatedPrincipal
    id=&quot;zope.anybody&quot;
    title=&quot;Unauthenticated User&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;unauthenticatedGroup
    id=&quot;zope.Anybody&quot;
    title=&quot;Unauthenticated Users&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;authenticatedGroup
    id=&quot;zope.Authenticated&quot;
    title=&quot;Authenticated Users&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;everybodyGroup
    id=&quot;zope.Everybody&quot;
    title=&quot;All Users&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;principal
    id=&quot;zope.manager&quot;
    title=&quot;Manager&quot;
    login=&quot;admin&quot;
    password_manager=&quot;Plain Text&quot;
    password=&quot;admin&quot;
    /&gt;

  &lt;grant
    role=&quot;zope.Manager&quot;
    principal=&quot;zope.manager&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/configure&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Running application ===

Now you can run the application by running ''./bin/buildout'' command followed by ''./bin/instance'' command.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
$ ./bin/buildout
$ ./bin/instance fg
&lt;/source&gt;

So, to run a Zope 3 application we have to use ''buildout'' recipes with proper configurations.

=== Using ZMI ===

After running your instance, If you open a web browser and go to ''http://localhost:8080'' you'll see the ZMI (''Zope Management Interface'').

Go ahead and click the ''Login'' link at the upper right.  Enter the user name and password as ''admin'', which is given in ''applications.zcml''.  Now click on ''[top]'' under Navigation on the right.  Play around with adding some content objects (the Zope 3 name for instances that are visible in the ZMI). Note how content objects can be arranged in a hierarchy by adding ''folders'' which are special content objects that can hold other content objects.

There is nothing special about the ZMI, it is just the default skin for Zope 3.  You can modify it to your liking, or replace it entirely.

When you're done exploring with the ZMI, go back to the window where you typed ''./bin/instance fg'' and press Control-C to stop Zope 3.

=== Hello world ===

Now you can begin your development inside ''src/ticketcollector'' directory.  Create a ''browser.py'' with following content:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from zope.publisher.browser import BrowserView

class HelloView(BrowserView):

    def __call__(self):
        return &quot;&quot;&quot;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
          &lt;title&gt;Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          Hello World
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now append the following text just above the last line of ''application.zcml'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;browser:page
  for=&quot;*&quot;
  name=&quot;hello&quot;
  permission=&quot;zope.Public&quot;
  class=&quot;ticketcollector.browser.HelloView&quot;
/&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see above, we are using ''page'' attribute from the ''browser'' namespace.  So, you have to include that namespace in the beginning ZCML as shown below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;configure
   xmlns=&quot;http://namespaces.zope.org/zope&quot;
   xmlns:browser=&quot;http://namespaces.zope.org/browser&quot;
   &gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

After restarting Zope, open ''http://localhost:8080/hello'', you can see that it displaying ''Hello World'' !.

== About Visual Localize ==
Visual Localize is a specialized tool for translating software and adapting the graphical user interface (GUI). Visual Localize is not a machine translation tool. Visual Localize as a computer aided translation (CAT) tool will help a human translator to translate software files using the internal database. In addition to this Visual Localize will help to prevent typical errors (e.g. truncated texts, non-unique usage of accelerators, ...) during the translation of software. 
Using a WYSIWYG editor to display all control elements on dialogs and menus allows the translator to see the context. Visual Localize enables translators to translate software applications (various software specific modules such as EXE, DLL (Win32 / .NET), OCX, XML, CHM, INI, RC, RESX, RESOURCES,.. etc.) into any language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This example shows how to use the ''i2c'' and ''i2c_stream_read'' programs with an extension board for the Khepera III robot. The extension board used here is the odor sensor board developed by [http://disal.epfl.ch DISAL]. With its tree VOC sensors, this board allows to measure the concentration of alcohol (or other substances) in the air. The sensors are internally sampled at several kHz, and the board integrates (averages) them over a certain period to provide a few samples per second to the outside world.

The interface to the outside world is an I2C bus, connected to the main CPU on the Khepera III robot. Over this I2C bus, the board can be configured and samples can be read in two different modes:
* In '''snapshot mode''', the board returns the last acquired value for each sensor.
* In '''streaming mode''', the board sends each sample exactly once. I.e., once streaming is started, the board buffers the samples in its internal memory. This buffer has to be read (and emptied) continuously in order to avoid buffer overruns.

In this example, we will configure the integration interval and read the samples both in '''snapshot''' and '''streaming''' mode. This is all done manually with the general-purpose ''i2c'' and ''i2c_stream_read'' programs. Of course, if one needs to do this more frequently, it is advisable to write a separate program for these tasks.

== Setup ==

Boot a Khepera III robot (equipped with an odor sensor board) and make sure it is [[Khepera III Toolbox/Network Setup|connected]] to your computer. In the remainder of this chapter, we assume that your robot is connected via USB.

Copy the I2C programs onto the robot
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
computer&gt; cd Programs
computer&gt; k3put +usb i2c i2c_stream_read
&lt;/source&gt;
You are now ready to work with the odor board.

== Configuring the integration interval ==

The odor board is a register based device with I2C address 0x50. The integration interval is stored in an 8-bit register at address 0x90.

First, let us read this register by issuing the following command:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c 0x50 write 0x90 read 1
$DATA,1,2,write 90,read 0a
&lt;/source&gt;
The output may look a bit cryptic at first glance, but it is actually very simple to read. The above message simply says that 2 messages have been transmitted on the I2C bus. The first message was a write message with a single byte (0x90), and the second message was a read message with a single byte (0x0a). This last byte is obviously the content of the register, and translates to 10 in decimal notation.

Hence, our current integration interval is 10. Note that the odor board actually uses a power-of-two scale for this interval, i.e. setting the interval to 9 would produce twice as many samples per second.

10 is quite slow, though - let's set the interval to 8, which is 4 times faster. To write that register, we simply transmit this new value after the register number:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c 0x50 write 0x90 8
$DATA,1,1,write 90 08
&lt;/source&gt;
Operation confirmed! One message was sent, containing two bytes (0x90, 0x08). Just to make sure that the new value has been accepted and stored in the register, let us read the register again:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c 0x50 write 0x90 read 1
$DATA,1,2,write 90,read 08
&lt;/source&gt;
Everything looks all right.

=== Reading the last value (snapshot mode) ===

The odor board stores the last acquired sample in register 0x92 (read-only). A sample actually consists of one value for each sensor, plus a timestamp derived from the internal oscillator on the odor board. All values are 16-bit and therefore require 2 bytes, totaling to a register size of 8 bytes.

To read this register, we will issue the following command:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c 0x50 write 0x92 read 8
$DATA,1,2,write 92,read 6b ... TODO
&lt;/source&gt;
The received message is to be interpreted as follows:
- Sensor 1: 
- Sensor 2: 
- Sensor 3: 
- Timestamp: 0x6b 0x0d -&gt; 107 + 13 * 256 = 3435

This '''snapshot mode''' mode is very handy if one only needs to request a sample every now and then, e.g. to take a decision whether or not the odor concentration has exceeded a certain threshold or not. However, if you want to plot the evolution of the odor concentration, you may want to query the board all the time for new values. If you do that too often, you may obtain the same sample several times. This is an effect that can be easily demonstrated with:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c -r 100 -d 0x50 write 0x92 read 8
&lt;/source&gt;
which does the same as above, but 100 times in a row. The output may look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
TODO
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, every sample has been transmitted about N (TODO) times, but this will depend upon the load of the CPU and the I2C bus.

=== Reading a stream of samples (streaming mode) ===

To get a consistent picture of the evolution of the odor concentration, it is advisable to &quot;stream&quot; the samples in a way that each sample is transmitted exactly once.

The odor board indeed provides a VOC streaming register (0x93). Reading this register with the ''i2c'' program is a bit painful, though, because streaming requires several (different) messages to be sent.

Fortunately, there is this other program - ''i2c_stream_read'' - which does all that automatically. This program takes as arguments the I2C device address (0x50), the streaming register (0x93) and the block length (8):
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
robot&gt; ./i2c_stream_read 0x50 stream 0x93 8
&lt;/source&gt;
and will return something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$BLOCK,0,1,A1 32 30 00 30 20 61
$BLOCK,1,1,BC 30 30 00 30 EB 52
$BLOCK,2,1,BD 31 30 00 30 64 54
$BLOCK,3,1,BE 32 30 00 30 D8 54
$BLOCK,4,1,BF 32 30 00 30 6B 53
$BLOCK,5,1,C0 31 30 00 30 9F 52
...
&lt;/source&gt;
Each line corresponds to an 8-byte data block that has been transmitted. The first byte of the block is a status byte indicating the number of samples remaining in the buffer (including the currently transmitted sample) and is printed in the second column (all 1's here). The 7 data bytes - printed in hex notation - make up the last column.

The odor sensor values are coded in the last 6 data bytes of each block. E.g., in the block we got the following values:
- Sensor 1: 
- Sensor 2: 
- Sensor 3:

== Plotting odor samples ==

To plot the evolution of the odor concentration, we just need to convert the output of the ''i2c_stream_read'' program into something that Matlab can read, and plot it there afterwards.

First, let us launch the program from a computer and redirect the output into a file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
computer&gt; ssh root@192.168.1.2 &quot;/root/your_username/i2c_stream_read 0x50 0x93 8&quot; &gt; odor_stream
&lt;/source&gt;
Once you feel you've collected enough samples, press Ctrl-C to stop the program.

Use ''parse_stream.pl'' to convert the samples into a text file with tab-separated values, i.e.
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
computer&gt; ./parse_stream &lt; odor_stream &gt; matlab_odor_stream
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, launch Matlab and type
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; plot_odor
&lt;/source&gt;
This Matlab script (m-file) will load the ''matlab_odor_stream'' file and plot the three curves.

[[File:Fleischschnacka.JPG|thumb|400px|''Fleischnacka'' served with a bit of broth and green salad.]]
'''''Fleischnacka''''' or '''''Fleischschnacka''''',&lt;ref&gt;Though {{wp|Alsace}} is a small region of France, its dialect varies pretty much between areas.&lt;/ref&gt; literally ''&quot;snails of meat&quot;'' (from German ''&quot;Fleisch&quot;'', ''meat'', and ''&quot;Schnecke&quot;'', ''snail'') is an Alsatian dish consisting of minced or mashed beef (or sometimes other meats, like rests of [[Cookbook:Pot-au-feu|pot-au-feu]]) rolled in fresh noodle dough and cut into slices which are then cooked in stock.

==Ingredients==
For the dough:
*1 lb. [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
*4 ea. eggs
*salt
*1 cup water

For the filling:
*2½ lb. minced beef
*1 large onion
*3 cloves garlic
*nutmeg
*salt and pepper
*Oil
*2 pints beef stock
*4 cups Riesling (optional)

== Procedure ==
Preparation of the dough:
#Mix together the flour and eggs, add the water and salt.
#Knead the dough until smooth and set aside for 1 hour.
#Mince the onion, parsley and garlic.  Mix into the minced meat along with the eggs, nutmeg, salt and pepper.
#Roll out the dough into a rectangle.
#Spread the filling evenly over the dough and roll up into a cylinder.Seal the edge with water and cut into slices (not too thick).
#Brown the slices in oil. 
#Add the stock (and wine if used) and cook for 20 minutes.
Serve with a green salad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We know from experience that we arrive at the idea of fractions by merely considering the idea of the quotient of two integers. The motivation behind this is simply to arrive at a multiplicative inverse for every non-zero element. Thus, we can consider an integral domain R and construct its ''field of fractions''. However, we can also try to make this work for any commutative ring, even if it has zero divisors other than 0. There is a slight alteration required because we cannot define &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}\frac{c}{d}&lt;/math&gt; when bd=0. Thus, we must place restrictions in case b and d are zero divisors in the case of multiplication. In this case, it is called the ''localization of a ring.''

==Definitions==
A ''multiplicative'' subset of a commutative ring R is a subset that does not contain 0, does contain 1, and is closed under multiplication. Some examples of multiplicative sets are the set of nonzero elements of an integral domain, the set of elements of a commutative ring that are not zero divisors, and R\P where P is a prime ideal of the commutative ring R.

Let S be a multiplicative subset. We will consider the Cartesian product R×S. Define the equivalence relation on this product: (a,b)~(c,d) whenever there exists an s such that s(ad-bc)=0.

If it is an integral domain, then (a,b) could be regarded as a/b. Now to check that this is an equivalence relation, it is obvious that it is reflexive and symmetric. To prove that it is transitive, let (a,b)~(c,d) and let (c,d)~(e,f). Then there are elements s and t within S such that s(ad-bc)=0 and such that t(cf-de)=0. This implies that stfad-stfbc=0 and that sbtcf-sbtde=0. Adding the two, we get stfad-sbtde=0, or std(af-be)=0, implying that (a,b)~(e,f).

We can thus use these equivalence classes to define the fraction: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalence class containing (a,b).

Now we set this to be a ring. First, we define addition to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}+\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad+bc}{bd}&lt;/math&gt; and multiplication to be &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d}=\frac{ac}{bd}&lt;/math&gt;. The additive identity is &lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{1}&lt;/math&gt; and the additive inverse is &lt;math&gt;\frac{-a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplicative identity is simply &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now we prove below that it is indeed a ring:

==Theorem==
The set of fractions with addition and multiplication as defined is a commutative ring, and if R is an integral domain, then the fractions are also. And if additionally S is R\{0}, then the set of fractions is a field.

===Proof===
First, we note that
#&lt;math&gt;(\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d}) + \frac{e}{f} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd} + \frac{e}{f} = \frac{(ad+bc)f + bde}{bdf} = \frac{adf + b(cf+de)}{bdf} = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{cf+de}{df} = \frac{a}{b} + (\frac{c}{d} + \frac{e}{f})&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} + \frac{0}{1} = \frac{a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 0}{b \cdot 1} = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\forall c \in S : 1_R (0\cdot 1 - 0\cdot c) = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{0}{1} = \frac{0}{c} (*)&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} + \frac{-a}{b} = \frac{ab + b(-a)}{bb} = \frac{0}{bb} = \frac{0}{1}&lt;/math&gt;
, from which follows that &lt;math&gt;(R \times S, +)&lt;/math&gt; is a group.

It is abelian because of the definition of the sum in S and R is commutative.

Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;(R \times S, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a monoid because
#&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{a}{b} = \frac{1a}{1b} = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
#and &lt;math&gt;(\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d}) \cdot \frac{e}{f} = \frac{ace}{bdf} = \frac{a}{b} \cdot (\frac{c}{d} \cdot \frac{e}{f})&lt;/math&gt;, where two (not difficult) intermediate steps are left to the reader.

And, also the distributive laws hold, because
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \left( \frac{c}{d} + \frac{e}{f} \right) = \left( \frac{c}{d} + \frac{e}{f} \right) \frac{a}{b} = \frac{acf +ade}{bdf}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{acf +ade}{bdf} = \frac{acbf + adbe}{bdfb} = \frac{ac}{bd} + \frac{ae}{bf}&lt;/math&gt;
, which shows that we have indeed found a ring.

The ring is commutative because of the definition of the product in S R is commutative.

Let now R be an integral domain, and let &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d} \in S&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, because of &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; and since &lt;math&gt;bd \in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \frac{ac}{bd} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \frac{ac}{bd} = \frac{0}{bd} \Leftrightarrow \exists s \in S: s(ac\cdot bd - 0 \cdot bd) = sacbd = 0&lt;/math&gt;. But since R was assumed to be an integral domain, and &lt;math&gt;s, b, d \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;s, b, d \in S&lt;/math&gt;, the last statement is exactly equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\exists s \in S: a = 0 \vee c = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is in turn equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\exists s \in S: sab = s(ab - 0c) = 0 \vee \exists s \in S: scd = s(cd - 0d) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and this is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = 0 \vee \frac{c}{d} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which shows that the fraction set is an integral domain if R is one.

Let's assume now that S = R \ {0}, and let &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \neq 0 \Leftrightarrow a \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where the last equivalence is due to (*) and &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} = 0 \Leftrightarrow \exists s \in S: s(a1 - b0) = as1 = as = 0 \Leftrightarrow a=0&lt;/math&gt;, where the last equivalence is in turn due to the fact that R is an integral domain and S does not contain zero. Then &lt;math&gt;ab \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; due to the fact that R is an integral domain, and thereofore &lt;math&gt;ab \in S&lt;/math&gt; since S = R \ {0}, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a} = \frac{ab}{ab}&lt;/math&gt;. But since &lt;math&gt;\forall s \in S: s(ab1 - ba1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\frac{ab}{ab} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{b}{a} = 1&lt;/math&gt; and therefore, by noting that we have assumed R to be commutative, we have that every element of R\{0} is invertible.

From this follows that the set of fractions is indeed a field, because we have already checked all field axioms, QED.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although there is a theory of non-commutative polynomial rings, it presents some difficulties and will not be treated on this page. Thus, we will work only with commutative rings for their polynomial rings.

The degree of a polynomial &lt;math&gt;a_0+a_1X+...+a_nX^n&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a field, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials of &lt;math&gt;R[X]&lt;/math&gt;, then we can divide &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;f=gq+r&lt;/math&gt;. However, we can also do this for any arbitrary ring if the leading coefficient of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is 1.

#Mix well, roll into a round shape.
#Place on a cookie sheet.
#Bake for an hour
# After the hour is done you get you're gay and beloved partner and put it all over the body.
# One by one you remove every nurple in the body
# Once you have eaten all the nurples you should have a major erection, you both and your partner.
# By this time you and Your partner are experiencing some strange eager to engage in sexual activity.
# Now this is the time where you have you partner take sexually take off you clothing starting with the shirt then pants and so on.
# When you are completely naked is when you can start to have sexual activity, don't be afraid to yell your partners name while you enjoy it.
# After a minuets or two stop and do you favorite position like the cowboy or the frogger. Next proceed with the all time favorite the 69.
# When you and your partner are done having sexual activities order some donuts for a little sexual desert.
# Put your semi erected oe is through the donut hole and let you're partner eat the donut.
# Finally sit on the couch with you're partner and watch an movie like titanic or a movie in that fashion and really enjoy the gay relationship that you have with your partner.
# When the movie is done don't be afraid to have sex the way you just did, it will show how much passion you have for your partner.
# Finally repeat steps 1-19</text>

==2. Identify from pictures or personal observation ten tropical fishes.&lt;br&gt; a. Explain their breeding habits.&lt;br&gt; b. Give the habitat or country in which they are found.==
===Neon Tetra===
{{Species id
| common_name = Neon Tetra
| latin_name = Paracheirodon innesi
| image =Neonka obecna paracheirodon innesi.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The Neon Tetra has a dark olive-green back over a silver-white abdomen. The fish is characterized by an iridescent blue horizontal stripe along each side of the fish from its nose to the base of the adipose fin, and an iridescent red stripe that begins at the middle of the body and extends posteriorly to the base of the caudal fin. During the night, the color disappears as the fish rests—it reactivates once it becomes active in the morning. It grows to approximately 3 cm (1.25 in) in overall length. Sexual dimorphism is slight, the female having a slightly larger belly.
| range = The Neon Tetra is native to blackwater or clearwater streams in southeastern Colombia, eastern Peru, and western Brazil, including the tributaries of the Solimões. Fish are collected in warm-flowing (21–29°C) clear and blackwater streams, but never in whitewater rivers of Andean origin. 
| reproduction = To breed Neon Tetras, place a pair of the species in a breeding tank without any light, and gradually increase the lighting until spawning occurs. Other inducers include mosquito larvae and a hardness of less than 4 degrees. Some also recommend letting the level of nitrates rise, then do at least 50% water change to simulate the fresh rain the tetras get in their natural habitat, the Amazon. It is recommended that everything you place in the aquarium be sterilized, as well as the aquarium top. Because the adults will often eat newly-hatched fry, it is best to remove them as soon as the eggs have been laid. The eggs are especially sensitive to light. Eggs will hatch within 24 hours of the laying. Fry can be fed rotifers, especially infusoria and egg yolk for 1 to 4 weeks, followed by nauplii of brine shrimp, shaved cattle liver, and formulated diets. Fry will achieve their adult coloration at approximately one month of age. Adults can spawn every two weeks.
}}

===Afra Cichlid===
{{Species id
| common_name = Afra Cichlid
| latin_name = Cynotilapia afra
| image =C afra.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The afra cichlid has an elongate body typically with vertical blue and black bars. However, there are many different colorations depending on the region the fish is from, for example, the male fish from Kobwe have greenish stripes on blue-black body. They can grow up to 10 cm. Like many other cichlid from Lake Malawi, afra cichlids are mouthbrooders. Males defend boulders as their territories and feed from algae on those boulders. Females congregate in mid-water and feed from plankton.
| range = This fish is endemic to the central and northern parts of Lake Malawi and is found in rocky habitats.
| reproduction = Like many mbuna cichlids, this is a notoriously aggressive fish that should be kept in a species or mbuna tank. The best practice is to keep one male with several females. They should be provided with large spaces with plenty of hiding shelters.
}}

===Angel Fish===
{{Species id
| common_name = Angel Fish
| latin_name = Pterophyllum spp.
| image =Pterophyllum altum.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The three species of Pterophyllum are unusually shaped for cichlids being greatly laterally compressed, with round bodies and elongated triangular-shaped dorsal and anal fins. This body shape allows them to hide among roots and plants, often on a vertical surface. Naturally occurring angelfish are frequently striped longitudinally, colouration which provides additional camouflage. Angelfish are ambush predators and prey on small fish and macroinvertebrates. All Pterophyllum species form monogamous pairs. Eggs are generally laid on a submerged log or a flattened leaf. As is the case for other cichlids, brood care is highly developed.
| range = All Pterophyllum species originate from the Amazon River basin in tropical South America.
| reproduction = ''P. scalare'' is relatively easy to breed in the aquarium, although one of the results of generations of inbreeding is that many breeds have almost completely lost their rearing instincts resulting in the tendency of the parents to eat their young. In addition, it is very difficult to accurately identify the gender of any individual until they are nearly ready to breed.

Angelfish pairs form long-term relationships where each individual will protect the other from threats and potential suitors. Upon the death or removal of one of the mated pair, some breeders have experienced a total refusal of the other mate to pair up with any other angelfish; others have had more success with subsequent mates. Both parents care for the young.

Depending upon aquarium conditions, P. scalare reaches sexual maturity at the age of six to twelve months or more. In situations where the eggs are removed from the aquarium immediately after spawning, the pair is capable of spawning every seven to ten days. Around the age of approximately three years, spawning frequency will decrease and eventually cease.

When the pair is ready to spawn, they will choose an appropriate medium upon which to lay the eggs and spend one to two days picking off detritus and algae from the surface. This medium may be a broad-leaf plant in the aquarium, a flat surface such as a piece of slate placed vertically in the aquarium, a length of pipe, or even the glass sides of the aquarium. The female will deposit a line of eggs on the spawning substrate, followed by the male who will fertilize the eggs. This process will repeat itself until there are a total of 100 to up to 1200+ eggs, depending on the size and health of the female fish. The pair will take turns maintaining a high rate of water circulation around the eggs by swimming very close to the eggs and fanning the eggs with their pectoral fins. In a few days, the eggs hatch and the fry remain attached to the spawning substrate. During this period, the fry will not eat and will survive by consuming the remains of their yolk sacs. At one week, the fry will detach and become free-swimming. Successful parents will keep close watch on the eggs until they become free-swimming. At the free-swimming stage, the fry can be fed newly-hatched frozen och fresh (i.e. alive) brine shrimp (Artemia spp.).
}}

===Discus===
{{Species id
| common_name = Discus
| latin_name = Symphysodon spp.
| image = Blue Discus.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Like cichlids from the genus Pterophyllum, all Symphysodon species have a laterally compressed body shape. In contrast to Pterophyllum, however, extended finnage is absent giving Symphysodon a more rounded shape. It is this body shape from which their common name, “discus”, is derived. The sides of the fish are frequently patterned in shades of green, red, brown, and blue. The height and length of the grown fish are both about {{units|20–25 cm|8–10 in}}.
| range = Discus (''Symphysodon spp.'') are a genus of three species of freshwater cichlid fishes native to the Amazon River basin
| reproduction = Another characteristic of Symphysodon species is the way they care for their larvae. As for most cichlids, brood care is highly developed with both the parents caring for the young. Additionally, adult discus produce a secretion through their skin, off which the larvae live during their first few days. This behaviour has also been observed for Uaru species.
}}

===Gold Barb===
{{Species id
| common_name = Gold Barb
| latin_name = Puntius semifasciolatus
| image =Gold Barb Puntius semifasciolatus 6.png
| caption = 
| description = The gold barb is a medium-long barb. Adults have highly arched backs and a short pair of barbels on the upper jaw at the corners of the mouth. The back is light to reddish brown, the sides are metallic green or yellow-green, with a brassy or golden sheen below. The belly is whitish, turning orange-red in males at mating time. Females can be distinguished by their dull colors and their overall bulk. The average size of adults is {{units|7 - 8 cm|2.75 to 3 inches}}.
| range = Its native habitat is the Red River basin in southeast China. 
| reproduction = An egg-scatterer, adult barbs will spawn around a hundred eggs. This breeding occurs at the first light in the early morning.
}}

===Guppy===
{{Species id
| common_name = Guppy 
| latin_name = Poecilia reticulata
| image =Guppy-Male-and-Female.JPG
| caption = 
| description = The guppy (Poecilia reticulata) is one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish species in the world. It is a small member of the Poecilidae family (females 4-6 centimeters long, males 2½–3½ centimeters long) and like all other members of the family, is live-bearing.
| range = Guppies are native to Trinidad and parts of South America, specifically Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Brazil, Guyana, Netherlands Antilles, Trinidad and Tobago, the US Virgin Islands, and Venezuela.
| reproduction = Guppies are highly prolific livebearers. The gestation period of a guppy is 22-30 days, with an average of 28 days. After the female guppy is inseminated, a dark area near the anus, known as the gravid spot, will enlarge and darken. Guppies prefer water temperatures of about {{units|28 °C|82 °F}} for reproduction. The female guppy drops of between 2-100 fry, typically ranging between 30 and 60. After giving birth, the female is ready for conception again within only a few hours.
}}

===Molly===
{{Species id
| common_name = Molly
| latin_name = Poecilia sphenops
| image =Black molly.jpg
| caption = 
| description = This species is one of the most well-known aquarium fishes and nearly as easy to keep and prolific as guppies (for optimal health and breeding success, they demand fresh vegetable food like algae). There are several other popular breeds, like the golden molly nicknamed &quot;24 karat&quot;, or the balloon molly, which however has a deformed spine and a decreased lifespan due to the associated health problems. Also, breeds with altered caudal fin structures like lyretails exist. The wild form is in fact quite rarely kept, as it has a rather plain silvery coloration suffused with brown and green hues. If given good care with ample sunlight, high water temperatures and fresh vegetables, they will, however, prove charming fish who make up for their somewhat plain coloration with their lively behavior.
| range = Mollies inhabit the coastal brackish and marine waters of Mexico. 
| reproduction = Fertilization is internal and is accomplished by means of highly modified fin elements within the anal fin of males that form a structure known as the gonopodium. Sailfin mollies produce broods of 10-140 live young, depending upon maturity and size, and females may store sperm long after the demise of their relatively short-lived mates. The gestation period for this species is approximately 3-4 weeks, depending upon temperature, and a single female may give birth on multiple occasions throughout the year. Although sex ratios of the broods are balanced, adult populations tend to be largely female as males appear to suffer higher rates of mortality due to a greater susceptibility to predators and disease as a consequence of their brighter colours and a life devoted to frenzied breeding. There is no parental care exhibited by this species.
}}

===Betta===

{{Species id
| common_name = Betta
| latin_name = Betta
| image =Betta albimarginata 060311 8.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Betta Bleeker, 1850 is a large genus of small, often colorful, freshwater ray-finned fishes.  All the Betta species are small fishes, but they vary considerably in size, ranging from under 2.5 cm (1 inch) total length in B. chanoides to 14 cm (5.5 inches) in the Akar betta (B. akarensis).[1]

Bettas are anabantoids, which means they can breathe atmospheric air thanks to a unique organ called the labyrinth. This accounts for their ability to thrive in low-oxygen water conditions that would kill most other fish, such as rice paddies, slow-moving streams, drainage ditches, and large puddles.
| range = The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) is one of the most popular species of freshwater aquarium fish. It is native to the Mekong river basin in Southeast Asia.
| reproduction = The various bettas can be divided into two groups, based on their spawning behavior: some build bubble nests, like B. splendens, while others are mouthbrooders, like B. picta. The mouthbrooding species are sometimes called &quot;pseudo bettas&quot;.
}}
===Goby===
{{Species id
| common_name = Goby
| latin_name = Elacatinus
| image =Elacatinus evelynae.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Neon gobies are very small, torpedo-shaped fish. Although sizes vary slightly by species, they are generally about {{units|2.5 cm|1 inch}} long. They have dark bodies with iridescent stripes (the color of which varies by species) running from the tip of the nose to the base of the caudal fin. Like all gobies, their dorsal fin is split in two, the anterior dorsal fin being rounded like that of a clownfish and the posterior dorsal fin being relatively flat. The anal fin lines up with the posterior dorsal fin and is of similar shape. The pectoral fins are nearly circular, and, like all other fins, transparent.

They are well-documented cleaner fish, setting up stations where often much larger fish (sometimes even fish who would normally eat the gobies) come to have the gobies eat their small external parasites. This is an excellent example of symbiosis – the cleaned fish are healthier and the gobies have not only an excellent food source but also relative protection from potential predators.
| range = Neon gobies are native to the tropical reefs of the Gulf of Mexico, from Texas to Belize, where they live primarily in the rocks. 
| reproduction = If kept in pristine conditions and fed well neon gobies will readily spawn in home aquaria. A species or breeding tank is required, as the fry are small and will be eaten by most other fish. The gobies are sexually dimorphic, but the difference is not easy to ascertain so they are normally kept in large groups to ensure a balance of sexes. They will lay their eggs on any hard surface along the bottom, and the fry, which feed on small rotifers or other microscopic organisms, are fully developed within a month. The average lifespan for a neon goby is approximately a year to a year and a half.
}}
===Green Swordtail===
{{Species id
| common_name = Green Swordtail
| latin_name = Xiphophorus hellerii
| image =Xiphophorus helleri 02.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The male green swordtail grows to a maximum overall length of {{units|14cm|5.5i}} and the female to {{units|16 cm|6.3 in}}. The name &quot;swordtail&quot; is commonly but mistakenly believed to be derived form the elongated lower lobe of the male's caudal fin (tailfin), but is actually derived from the sword shaped anal fin of the male. Sexual dimorphism is moderate, with the female being larger than the male but lacking the &quot;sword&quot;. The wild form is olive green in color, with a red or brown lateral stripe and speckles on the dorsal and, sometimes, caudal fins. The male's &quot;sword&quot; is yellow, edged in black below. Captive breeding has produced many color varieties, including black, red, and many patterns thereof, for the aquarium hobby.
| range = It is native to an area of North and Central America stretching from Veracruz, Mexico, to northwestern Honduras.
| reproduction = The males' elongated caudal fins have been found to significantly affect their chances at mating. The presence of a well-endowed male spurs the maturity of females while it inhibits the maturity of juvenile males in the vicinity as the well-endowed male.
}}

==3. Identify from pictures or personal observation ten fishes native to your own country. Explain their feeding and breeding habits.==
The fish presented here are native to the United States and Canada.  
===Brook Trout===
{{Species id
| common_name = Brook Trout
| latin_name = Salvelinus fontinalis
| image =Salvelinus fontinalis.jpg
| caption = Brook Trout
| description = The brook trout is of dark green to brown basic coloration with a distinctive marbled pattern (called vermiculations) of lighter shades across the flanks and back and extending at least to the dorsal fin, and often to the tail. There is a distinctive sprinkling of red dots, surrounded by blue haloes, along the flank. The belly and lower fins are reddish in color, the latter with white leading edges. Often the belly, particularly of the males, becomes very red or orange when the fish are spawning. The species reaches a maximum recorded length of 86 cm (33 in) and a maximum recorded weight of 9.4 kg (21 lb). It can reach at least seven years of age, with reports of 15-year-old specimens observed in California habitats to which the species has been introduced.
| range = The brook trout is native to small streams, creeks, lakes, and spring ponds. Some brook trout are anadromous. It is native to a wide area of eastern North America but increasingly confined to higher elevations southward in the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia, Canada from the Hudson Bay basin east, the Great Lakes–Saint Lawrence system, and the upper Mississippi River drainage as far west as eastern Iowa.
| reproduction = Individuals normally spend their entire life in fresh water, but some — colloquially called &quot;salters&quot; or &quot;sea run&quot; — may spend up to three months at sea in the spring, not straying more than a few kilometers from the river mouth. The fish return upstream to spawn in the late summer or autumn. The female constructs a depression in a location in the stream bed, sometimes referred to as a &quot;redd&quot;, where groundwater percolates upward through the gravel. One or more males approaches the female, fertilizing the eggs as the female expresses them. The eggs are slightly more dense than water. The female then buries the eggs in a small gravel mound. The eggs hatch in approximately 100 days.
| diet = Its diverse diet includes crustaceans, frogs and other amphibians, insects, molluscs, smaller fish, and even small aquatic mammals such as voles.
}}
===Rainbow Trout===
{{Species id
| common_name = Rainbow Trout
| latin_name = Oncorhynchus mykiss
| image =Oncorhynchus mykiss mid res 150dpi.jpg
| caption = 
| description =  The rainbow trout are unusual in that there are two forms which sometimes share the same habitat. The anadromous (sea-going) form called &quot;steelhead&quot; migrate to the ocean, though they must return to fresh water to reproduce.  The freshwater form is called &quot;rainbow trout&quot;, based on the broad red band along their sides. Steelhead are exactly the same species as rainbow trout. However, the difference is anadromy. After going to sea, their color changes, including loss of the red band. They stay at sea for 1-4 years, and return to fresh water to spawn. Rainbows stay in fresh water their whole lives.  Rainbows and steelhead occur in well-oxygenated lakes and streams where the temperature normally doesn't rise above 12°C in summer. 

Rainbows range from 12 to 36 inches in length. Steelhead grow longer, ranging from 50 to 122 cm (20 to 48 inches) in length. Steelhead range in weight from 2.5 kg to 10 kg (5.5 - 22 pounds).
| range = The rainbow trout is a species of salmonid native to tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America as well as much of the central, western, eastern, and especially the northern portions of the United States.
| reproduction = Unlike other Pacific Salmon, rainbow trout and steelhead do not necessarily die after spawning (they may spawn as many as four times).
| diet =Rainbow trout have a varied diet. They are predators, eating any smaller fish from nearly the time they are born. Insects make up a large portion of the diet, along with crayfish and other crustaceans, some lake dwelling species may become planktonic feeders. Trout of all ages will eat nearly anything they can grab, in contrast with the legendary, selective nature the fish often gets. They are near the top of the food chain in most freshwater environments. However they are lower on the rung of other freshwater predators such as pike, muskie, lake trout, and chinook salmon. Rainbows will take fish up to and over 1/3 of their length and larger.
}}

===Northern Pike===
{{Species id
| common_name = Northern Pike
| latin_name = Esox lucius
| image =Esox Lucius.JPG
| image_2 = Esox lucius1.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Northern pike are most often olive, shading into yellow to white along the belly. The flank is marked with short, light barlike spots and there are a few to many dark spots on the fins. The lower half of the gill cover lacks scales and they have large sensory pores on their head and on the underside of the lower jaw which are part of the lateral line system. Unlike the similar-looking and closely related muskellunge, the northern pike has light markings on a dark body background and fewer than six sensory pores on the underside of each side of the lower jaw.
| range = E. lucius is found throughout the northern hemisphere, including Russia, Europe, the British Isles, and North America.
| reproduction = The Northern Pike spawns beneath the ice in the Spring.  A female is followed by four or five smaller males as she seeks vegetative cover in the shallows.  When the eggs are released and fertilized, the stick to the vegetation where they are abandoned by the parents.
| diet =Pike are typical ambush predators; they lie in wait for prey, holding perfectly still for long periods and then exhibit remarkable acceleration as they strike. The fish has a distinctive habit of catching its prey sideways in the mouth, killing or immobilizing it with its sharp teeth, and then turning the prey lengthwise to swallow it. It eats mainly fish, but on occasion water voles and ducklings have also been known to fall prey to pike. Pike will aggressively strike at any fish in the vicinity, even at other pike. Young pike have been found dead from choking on a pike of a similar size. Northern pike also feed on frogs, insects and leeches. It has often been suggested that pike optimally forage on prey that are from 25 to 35% of their body length. Also on rare occasions pike have been reported to have eaten young bald eagles.
}}

===Bluegill===
{{Species id
| common_name = Bluegill
| latin_name = Lepomis macrochirus
| image =Lepomis macrochirus photo.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The Bluegill is a species of freshwater fish sometimes referred to as bream, brim, or copper nose.  The bluegill's most notable feature is the blue or black &quot;ear&quot;, actually an extension of the gill cover called the opercular flap. Its name, however, comes from the bright blue edging visible on its gill rakers. It can be distinguished from similar species by the (not always pronounced) vertical bars along its flanks. The bluegill grows to a maximum overall length of approximately 40 cm (16 in).
| range = The bluegill is native to a wide area of North America, from Québec to northern Mexico, and has been widely transplanted to stock game fish for anglers. 
| reproduction = These fish spawn in June in nests in the shallows. During this period males assume a very bold coloration, as they are guarding their nests. An interesting aspect of their biology is that some males assume the coloration of the female fish so that the nest-guarding males won't show aggression towards them. Then these &quot;sneaker&quot; males enter nests and spawn.
| diet = The natural diet of the bluegill consists largely of small invertebrates and very small fish.
}}

===Smallmouth Bass===
{{Species id
| common_name = Smallmouth Bass
| latin_name = Micropterus dolomieu
| image =Micropterus dolomieu2.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The smallmouth bass is generally green with dark vertical bands rather than a horizontal band along the side. There are 13-15 soft rays in the dorsal fin. The upper jaw of smallmouth bass does not extend beyond the back of the eye.
| range = The smallmouth bass is native to the upper and middle Mississippi River basin, the Saint Lawrence River–Great Lakes system, and up into the Hudson Bay basin.
| reproduction = The female can lay up to 21,000,000 eggs, which are guarded by the male in his nest.
| diet =Carnivorous, its diet comprises crayfish, insects, and smaller fish, the young also feeding on zooplankton.
}}

===Largemouth Bass===
{{Species id
| common_name = Largemouth Bass
| latin_name = Micropterus salmoides
| image =Micropterus salmoides 2.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The largemouth is marked by a series of dark, sometimes black, blotches forming a jagged horizontal stripe along each flank. The upper jaw of a largemouth bass extends beyond the rear edge of the eye.
| range = Native to the central and southeastern United States, the largemouth bass has been introduced throughout most of the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bio.umass.edu/biology/conn.river/smlgbass.html&lt;/ref&gt;
| reproduction = Spawning occurs in shallow areas of lakes and ponds in the spring. Males arrive first, selecting a territory on fine gravel, coarse sand or among sparse vegetation. The male will slightly clear, using his fins, a shallow depression into which he will entice a female to deposit her eggs. Females can lay up to a million eggs during each season. The male guards the embryos until the larvae hatch and then will continue to guard the &quot;fry&quot; until they disperse from the nest. During the guarding period, the male ferociously attacks any potential predators that approach too closely.
| diet =The juvenile largemouth bass consumes mostly zooplankton and insects. Adults consume small fish, crayfish, and frogs. Prey items can be as large as 25 to 35% of the bass's body length. Largemouth bass have even been reported to take small birds, small mammals, such as mice and rats and small snakes.
}}

===White Perch===
{{Species id
| common_name = White Perch
| latin_name = Morone americana
| image =White perch GLERL.jpg
| caption = 
| description = Generally silvery-white in color, hence the name, it has been reported up to 49.5 cm in length and weighing 2.2 kg.
| range = Although favoring brackish waters, it is also found in fresh water and coastal areas from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario south to the Pee Dee River in South Carolina.
| reproduction = White perch are a prolific species. The female can deposit over 140,000 eggs in a spawning session, lasting just over a week. Several males will often attend a spawning female, and each may fertilize a portion of her eggs. The young hatch within 1 to 6 days of fertilization.
| diet =White perch are known to eat the eggs of many species native to the Great Lakes, such as walleye and other true perches. At times, fish eggs are 100% of its diet.
}}

===Black Crappie===
{{Species id
| common_name = Black Crappie
| latin_name = Pomoxis nigromaculatus
| image =Pomoxis nigromaculatus1.jpg
| caption = 
| description = The black crappue is most accurately identified by the seven or eight spines on its dorsal fin.
| range = The crappie is native throughout the eastern half of Canada and the United States, and has been widely introduced in the west as well. As of 2005, populations existed in all of the lower 48 states of the United States.
| reproduction = The breeding season varies by location, due to the species’ great range; breeding temperature is 14‒20 °C (58‒68 °F) and spawning occurs between April and June. Spawning occurs in a nest built by the male, who guards the eggs and young.
| diet =Adult crappies feed predominantly on smaller species, including the young of their own predators (which include the northern pike, muskellunge, and walleye). They have diverse diets, however, including zooplankton, insects, and crustaceans
}}

===Striped Bass===
{{Species id
| common_name = Striped Bass
| latin_name = Morone saxatilis
| image =StripedBass.JPG
| caption = 
| description = The striped bass is a typical member of the Moronidae family in shape, having a streamlined, silvery body marked with longitudinal dark stripes running from behind the gills to the base of the tail. Maximum size is 200 cm (6.6 ft) and maximum scientifically recorded weight 57 kg (125 US pounds). Striped bass are believed to live for up to 30 years.
| range = Striped bass are found along the Atlantic coastline of North America from the St. Lawrence River into the Gulf of Mexico to approximately Louisiana. They are anadromous fish that migrate between fresh and salt water. Spawning takes place in freshwater.
| reproduction = Striped bass spawn in freshwater and spend their adult lives in saltwater (i.e., it is anadromous). They can also live exclusively in freshwater and currently flourish in several inland water bodies.
| diet = Striped bass are primarily nocturnal feeders, eating insects, crustaceans, and other fish.
}}

===Haddock===
{{Species id

==4. Define the following parts of a fish:== 

[[Image:Lampanyctodes hectoris (Hector's lanternfish)2.png|thumb|350px|''Lampanyctodes hectoris'' &lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;
(1) - operculum (gill cover), (2) - lateral line, (3) - dorsal fin, (4) - adipose fin, (5) - caudal peduncle, (6) - caudal fin, (7) - anal fin, (8) - photophores, (9) - pelvic fins (paired), (10) - pectoral fins (paired)&lt;/small&gt;]]
===a. Dorsal fin===
A dorsal fin is a fin located on the backs of fishes, whales, dolphins and porpoises, as well as the (extinct) ichthyosaurs. Its main purpose is to stabilize the animal against rolling and assist in sudden turns. Some animals have developed dorsal fins with protective functions, such as spines or venom. Many catfish can lock the leading ray of the dorsal fin in an extended position to discourage predation or to wedge themselves into a crevice.
Dorsal fins come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

===b. Pectoral fin===
The paired pectoral fins are located on each side, usually just behind the operculum, and are homologous to the forelimbs of tetrapods. A peculiar function of pectoral fins, highly developed in some fish, is the creation of the dynamic lifting force that assists, e.g., sharks, in maintaining depths and enables the flight for flying fish.

===c. Pelvic fin===
The paired pelvic or ventral fins are located ventrally below the pectoral fins. They are homologous to the hindlimbs of tetrapods.

===d. Anal fin===
The anal fin is located on the ventral surface behind the anus. This fin is used to stabilize the fish while swimming.

===e. Caudal fin===
The caudal fin is the tail fin, located at the end of the caudal peduncle.

=== f. Lateral line===
The lateral line is a sense organ used to detect movement and vibration in the surrounding water. It consists of a line of receptors running along each side of the fish.

=== g. Operculum===
The operculum of a bony fish is the hard bony flap covering and protecting the gills. In most fish, the rear edge of the operculum roughly marks the division between the head and the body. The operculum is composed of four bones; the opercle, preopercle, interopercle, and subopercle. The morphology of this anatomical feature varies greatly between species. For example, the bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) has a posteriorly and dorsally oriented rounded extension with a small black splotch present. In some species, the operculum can push water from the buccal cavity through the gills.
For some fish, the operculum is vital in obtaining oxygen. It opens as the mouth closes, causing the pressure inside the fish to drop. Water then flows towards the lower pressure across the fish's gill lamellae, allowing some oxygen to be absorbed from the water.
Cartilaginous fishes do not have an operculum. Without an operculum, other methods of getting water to the gills are required, such as ventilation.

=== h. Barbels ===
The head may have several fleshy structures known as barbels, which may be very long and resemble whiskers.

=== i. Swim bladder===
The gas bladder, or swim bladder, is an internal organ that contributes to the ability of a fish to control its buoyancy, and thus to stay at the current water depth, ascend, or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. It is often absent in fast swimming fishes such as the Tuna and Mackerel families.

===j. Gills===
The gills, located under the operculum, are a respiratory organ for the extraction of oxygen from water and for the excretion of carbon dioxide. They are not usually visible, but can be seen in some species e.g. the frilled shark.

==5. State briefly the proper care and feeding of fishes of: &lt;br&gt;a. Tropical zone &lt;br&gt;b. Temperate zone.==
Ideal aquarium ecology reproduces the balance found in nature in the closed system of an aquarium. In practice it is virtually impossible to maintain a perfect balance. As an example, a balanced predator-prey relationship is nearly impossible to maintain in even the largest of aquaria. Typically, an aquarium keeper must take steps to maintain balance in the small ecosystem contained in his aquarium.

Approximate balance is facilitated by large volumes of water. Any event that perturbs the system pushes an aquarium away from equilibrium; the more water that is contained in a tank, the easier such a systemic shock is to absorb, as the effects of that event are diluted. For example, the death of the only fish in a three U.S. gallon tank (11 L) causes dramatic changes in the system, while the death of that same fish in a 100 U.S. gallon (400 L) tank with many other fish in it represents only a minor change in the balance of the tank. For this reason, hobbyists often favor larger tanks when possible, as they are more stable systems requiring less intensive attention to the maintenance of equilibrium.

There are a variety of nutrient cycles that are important in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface or through the actions of an air pump. Carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the nitrogen cycle, along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is usually enough to keep these other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.
===Water conditions===The solute content of water is perhaps the most important aspect of water conditions, as total dissolved solids and other constituents can dramatically impact basic water chemistry, and therefore how organisms are able to interact with their environment. Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic classification of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 0.5 PPT), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 0.5 to 30 PPT), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30 to 40 PPT), simulating an ocean or sea environment. Rarely, even higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.

Several other water characteristics result from dissolved contents of the water, and are important to the proper simulation of natural environments. The pH of the water is a measure of the degree to which it is alkaline or acidic. Saltwater is typically alkaline, while the pH of fresh water varies more. Hardness measures overall dissolved mineral content; hard or soft water may be preferred. Hard water is usually alkaline, while soft water is usually neutral to acidic. Dissolved organic content and dissolved gases content are also important factors.

Home aquarists typically use modified tap water supplied through their local water supply network to fill their tanks. Because of the chlorine used to disinfect drinking water supplies for human consumption, straight tap water cannot be used. In the past, it was possible to &quot;condition&quot; the water by simply letting the water stand for a day or two, which allows the chlorine time to dissipate. However, chloramine is now used more often as it is much stabler and will not leave the water as readily. Additives formulated to remove chlorine or chloramine are often all that is needed to make the water ready for aquarium use. Brackish or saltwater aquaria require the addition of a mixture of salts and other minerals, which are commercially available for this purpose.

More sophisticated aquarists may make other modifications to their base water source to modify the water's alkalinity, hardness, or dissolved content of organics and gases, before adding it to their aquaria. This can be accomplished by a range of different additives, such as sodium bicarbonate to raise pH. Some aquarists will even filter or purify their water prior to adding it to their aquarium. There are two processes used for that: deionization or reverse osmosis. In contrast, public aquaria with large water needs often locate themselves near a natural water source (such as a river, lake, or ocean) in order to have easy access to a large volume of water that does not require much further treatment.

The temperature of the water forms the basis of one of the two most basic aquarium classifications: tropical vs. cold water. Most fish and plant species tolerate only a limited range of water temperatures: Tropical or warm water aquaria, with an average temperature of about 25 °C (77 °F), are much more common, and tropical fish are among the most popular aquarium denizens. Cold water aquaria are those with temperatures below what would be considered tropical; a variety of fish are better suited to this cooler environment. More importantly than the temperature range itself is the consistency in temperature; most organisms are not accustomed to sudden changes in temperatures, which could cause shock and lead to disease. Water temperature can be regulated with a combined thermometer and heater unit (or, more rarely, with a cooling unit).

Water movement can also be important in accurately simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift simulated currents in an aquarium, depending on the conditions best suited for the aquarium's inhabitants. Water movement can be controlled through the use of aeration from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).

===Nitrogen cycle===
Of primary concern to the aquarist is management of the biological waste produced by an aquarium's inhabitants. Fish, invertebrates, fungi, and some bacteria excrete nitrogen waste in the form of ammonia (which will convert to ammonium, in acidic water) and must then pass through the nitrogen cycle. Ammonia is also produced through the decomposition of plant and animal matter, including fecal matter and other detritus. Nitrogen waste products become toxic to fish and other aquarium inhabitants at high concentrations.
====The Process====
A well-balanced tank contains organisms that are able to metabolize the waste products of other aquarium residents. The nitrogen waste produced in a tank is metabolized in aquaria by a type of bacteria known as nitrifiers (genus Nitrosomonas). Nitrifying bacteria capture ammonia from the water and metabolize it to produce nitrite. Nitrite is also highly toxic to fish in high concentrations. Another type of bacteria, genus Nitrospira, converts nitrite into nitrate, a less toxic substance to aquarium inhabitants. (Nitrobacter bacteria were previously believed to fill this role, and continue to be found in commercially available products sold as kits to &quot;jump start&quot; the nitrogen cycle in an aquarium. While biologically they could theoretically fill the same niche as Nitrospira, it has recently been found that Nitrobacter are not present in detectable levels in established aquaria, while Nitrospira are plentiful.) This process is known in the aquarium hobby as the nitrogen cycle.

In addition to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize nitrogen compounds, they remove nitrogen from the water by using it to build biomass. However, this is only temporary, as the plants release nitrogen back into the water when older leaves die off and decompose.
====Maintaining the Tank====
Although informally called the nitrogen cycle by hobbyists, it is in fact only a portion of a true cycle: nitrogen must be added to the system (usually through food provided to the tank inhabitants), and nitrates accumulate in the water at the end of the process, or become bound in the biomass of plants. This accumulation of nitrates in home aquaria requires the aquarium keeper to remove water that is high in nitrates, or remove plants which have grown from the nitrates.

Aquaria kept by hobbyists often do not have the requisite populations of bacteria needed to detoxify nitrogen waste from tank inhabitants. This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb nitrogen compounds and other toxins from the water, while biological filters provide a medium specially designed for colonization by the desired nitrifying bacteria. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, will stop working when their pores get full, so these components have to be replaced with fresh stocks constantly.

New aquaria often have problems associated with the nitrogen cycle due to insufficient number of beneficial bacteria, known as the &quot;New Tank Syndrome&quot;. Therefore, new tanks have to be &quot;matured&quot; before stocking them with fish. There are three basic approaches to this: the fishless cycle, the silent cycle, and slow growth.

No fish are kept in a tank undergoing a fishless cycle. Instead, small amounts of ammonia are added to the tank to feed the bacteria being cultured. During this process, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels are tested to monitor progress. The silent cycle is basically nothing more than densely stocking the aquarium with fast-growing aquatic plants and relying on them to consume the nitrogen, allowing the necessary bacterial populations time to develop. According to anecdotal reports of aquarists specializing in planted tanks, the plants can consume nitrogenous waste so efficiently that the spikes in ammonia and nitrite levels normally seen in more traditional cycling methods are greatly reduced, if they are detectable at all. More commonly slow growth entails slowly increasing the population of fish over a period of 6 to 8 weeks, giving bacteria colonies time to grow and stabilize with the increase in fish waste.

The largest bacterial populations are found in the filter; efficient filtration is vital. Sometimes, a vigorous cleaning of the filter is enough to seriously disturb the biological balance of an aquarium. Therefore, it is recommended to rinse mechanical filters in an outside bucket of aquarium water to dislodge organic materials that contribute to nitrate problems, while preserving bacteria populations. Another safe practice consists of cleaning only one half of the filter media every time the filter or filters are serviced.
===Biological Loading===
Biological loading is a measure of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its living inhabitants. High biological loading in an aquarium represents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to perturb. In addition, there are several fundamental constraints on biological loading based on the size of an aquarium. The surface area of water exposed to air limits dissolved oxygen intake by the tank. The capacity of nitrifying bacteria is limited by the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can be fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement.
====Calculating aquarium capacity====
An aquarium can only support a certain number of fish. Limiting factors include the availability of oxygen in the water and the rate at which the filter can process waste. Aquarists have developed a number of rules of thumb to allow them to estimate the number of fishes that can be kept in a given aquarium; the examples below are for small freshwater fish as larger freshwater fish and most marine fishes need much more generous allowances.

* 3 cm of fish length per 4 liters of water (i.e., a 6 cm-long fish would need about 8 liters of water).
* 1 cm of fish length per 30 square centimeters of surface area.
* 1 inch of fish length per gallon of water.
* 1 inch of fish length per 12 square inches of surface area.

Experienced aquarists warn against applying these rules too strictly because they do not consider other important issues such as growth rate, activity level, social behavior, and so on. To some degree, establishing the maximum loading capacity of an aquarium depends upon slowly adding fish and monitoring water quality over time, essentially a trial and error approach.

====Factors affecting capacity====

Though many conventional methods of calculating the capacity of aquarium is based on volume and pure length of fish, there are other variables. One variable is differences between fish. Smaller fish consume more oxygen per gram of body weight than larger fish. Labyrinth fish, having the capability to breathe atmospheric oxygen, are noted for not needing as much surface area (however, some of these fish are territorial, and may not appreciate crowding). Barbs also require more surface area than tetras of comparable size.

Oxygen exchange at the surface is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium. Some aquarists go so far as to say that a deeper aquarium with more volume holds no more fish than a shallower aquarium of the same surface area. The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through aeration, which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also the decomposition of waste materials.

The presence of waste materials presents itself as a variable as well. Decomposition is an oxygen-consuming process, therefore the more decaying matter there is, the less oxygen as well. Oxygen dissolves less readily in warmer water; this is a double-edged sword as warmer temperatures make more active fish, which in turn consume even more oxygen. Stress due to temperature changes is especially obvious in coldwater aquaria where the temperature may swing from low temperatures to high temperatures on hotter days.

==6. Fill an aquarium containing at least five gallons of water with a balance of plants and fishes, either tropical or native, and maintain the same for at least six months.==
This can be done by the individual Pathfinder at home, or as a group in a classroom or the regular Pathfinder meeting place.  If keeping fish as a group, be sure that everyone gets to participate in all aspects of their care.  The likelihood of success will be maximized by being sure to follow the guidelines set out in requirement five.

==7. Note the effect of the following on the fishes and aquarium in general:== 
===a. Too much light===
During the time that aquarium plants are exposed to light, carbon dioxide is absorbed and oxygen is expelled. The gases enter the plant mainly through the leaves. The carbon dioxide and water are chemically combined with the chlorophyll in the plant to produce simple sugars. The sugars are converted to starch and oxygen is produced as the by-product. The light in your tank is most important with respect to the chlorophyll. The chlorophyll is what absorbs the light to create the process of photosynthesis. The aquarium plant naturally absorbs more nutrients through the roots during this time.

===b. Too little light===
Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. When the lights are out, the photosynthesis process ceases but the respiration continues. The aquarium plant will use oxygen to break down food substances, which is released as energy in the form of heat. Carbon dioxide is produced and expelled as a result of this process.
So, when the lights are on the plants absorb carbon dioxide and expel oxygen. When the lights are out the aquarium plants absorb oxygen and expel carbon dioxide.

===c. Overfeeding===
Overfeeding is one of the major causes of fish loss. Overfeeding promotes fish waste (ammonia) to build up to a harmful level. It is best to feed your betta only enough food that it can eat in five minutes. If food is seen sitting on the bottom of the aquarium or bowl, the fish have been overfed.

===d. Excessive change in water temperature===


Rapid changes in water temperatures stress your fish. when fish are stressed they are more susceptible to disease and sickness.

===e. Too few plants and too many fishes===


Fish need plants in the wild for shelter, food, filtration, and oxygen. In an aquarium you supply their main source of food

==Notes==
When to use ''fish'' or ''fishes''. Use ''fish'' when talking about a school of the same species. Use ''fishes'' when talking about schools of different species. Any time you are talking about more than one species, use ''fishes''. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.amonline.net.au/fishes/what/fish.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Preliminaries==

===&lt;u&gt;How does a typical C Program look like?&lt;/u&gt;===

First, a very simple example of a C program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* Sample C program that outputs the word &quot;Hello&quot; */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
     printf(&quot;Hello\n&quot;);
     return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The program shown in the example above is what is referred to as a &lt;u&gt;'''program source code'''&lt;/u&gt;. The source code is made up of a combination of letters, numbers and other symbols. The source code can be created by the programmer/user using any text editor.

In the class, we will write C programs using the following format:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
      /* ...your variable declarations... */

      /* ...your statements... */

      return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===&lt;u&gt;What is a statement?&lt;/u&gt;===

All C programs are made up of a sequence of instructions. In C, instructions are also called &lt;u&gt;'''statements'''&lt;/u&gt;. In the English language, a statement is terminated by a period, a question mark or an exclamation point. Note that &lt;u&gt;'''in C language, a statement is terminated by a semicolon'''.&lt;/u&gt; In the example program above, there is only one statement -- the &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

===&lt;u&gt;What is a function?&lt;/u&gt;===

All statements should be written inside a user-defined &lt;u&gt;'''function'''&lt;/u&gt;. You may think of a function as a group or sequence of statements. It is analogous to the English language wherein a paragraph is made up of a sequence of statements. The word &quot;user-defined&quot; means that it is the user who defined (or wrote) the description of a function. In the example program above, there is only one user-defined function -- the &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function. &lt;u&gt;'''All C programs must have a &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function.'''&lt;/u&gt;


===&lt;u&gt;What is the use of { } symbols?&lt;u&gt;===

The symbol { is referred to as &lt;u&gt;'''open brace'''&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;'''open curly bracket'''&lt;/u&gt;. Likewise, the symbol } is called &lt;u&gt;'''close brace'''&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;'''close curly bracket'''&lt;/u&gt;. The curly brackets are used for grouping purposes. Think of an open curly bracket as something synonymous to begin and the close curly bracket as the symbol for end. Thus, in the example program above, the open and close curly brackets designate the beginning and the end of the &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function, respectively. Note that the curly brackets must always come in pair. A missing curly bracket is one of the most common cause of syntax errors.

As we shall see later on, the curly brackets are used to group several statements. 


===&lt;u&gt;What is the use of /* */ symbols?&lt;/u&gt;===

The symbols /* and */ are used to group comments inside the program. Comments are not instructions, rather they simply provide additional information (a textual description) such as what the program is doing, what are the inputs, what are the outputs, etc. Think of /* as the beginning of a comment, and the */ as the end of a comment. Just like the curly brackets, these symbols always come in pair. comments are optional and maybe placed anywhere within the program source code. 

It is possible to write several lines of comments inside the /* */. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/* The following is 
   an example 
   of a very simple C program */
void main()
{
     printf(&quot;Hello\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;


Note that comments cannot be nested, meaning you cannot put /* */ inside /* */. For example, the following is erroneous:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
/*
   this is a comment

   /* this is one more comment - which will cause an error */

*/
&lt;/source&gt;


===&lt;u&gt;What about the other symbols?&lt;/u&gt;===

The meaning of the other symbols, i.e., &lt;tt&gt;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; will be explained later.

==Naming Conventions==

===&lt;u&gt;What is a name? What are the naming conventions in C?&lt;/u&gt;===

Data and instructions to manipulate data are referred to by their names. In C, there are rules and conventions to follow in giving a name to something; these are as follows:

1. Names are made up of letters and digits.
 
2. The first character &lt;u&gt;'''MUST'''&lt;/u&gt; be a letter.

3. C is case-sensitive, meaning the lower-case letter 'a' is &lt;u&gt;'''NOT'''&lt;/u&gt; the same as the uppercase letter 'A'.

4. The underscore symbol _ is considered as a letter in C. It is not recommended to be used, however, as the first character in a name. 

5. At least the first 31 characters of a name are significant.

Examples:

The following are examples of valid names:

&lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;main&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;hello&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;salary&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;rate_per_hour&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;student_1&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;student_2&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;student_3&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;First_Name&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;ComputeGrade&lt;/tt&gt;


The following are examples of invalid names:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

1                 /* must start with a character */

1_ab              /* must start with a character */

a&amp;                /* &amp; symbol cannot be used in a name */

xyz_%             /* % symbol cannot be used in a name */

$money            /* must start with a character,

                     $ cannot be used in a name */
&lt;/source&gt;




===&lt;u&gt;What is a keyword?&lt;/u&gt;===

As a language, C has its own vocabulary -- a set of &lt;u&gt;'''keywords'''&lt;/u&gt;. These names are reserved and cannot be used for other purposes such as in naming user-defined variable names. In the example program, the name &lt;tt&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt; is a keyword. 

The ANSI C language has 32 keywords (ONLY!).

Note that the name &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; is actually &lt;u&gt;'''not a C keyword'''&lt;/u&gt; and not really part of the C language. It is a standard input/output library pre-defined name. These distinctions will be explained later.

==Constants, Variables, Data Types, Declarations==

===&lt;u&gt;What is a constant?&lt;/u&gt;===

A constant is an entity whose value does not change. A constant can either be a numeric constant or a literal constant.

Example:

Example of numeric constants:

&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;500&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;-10000.100&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;3.1416&lt;/tt&gt;

Example of literal constants:

&lt;tt&gt;'A'&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;&quot;Hello&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;&quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;


Note: In C, a literal constant with only one character is referred to simply as a &lt;u&gt;'''character'''&lt;/u&gt;. It is written such that it is enclosed in a pair of single quotes. If there is more than one character, it is called a &lt;u&gt;'''string'''&lt;/u&gt;. A string is written enclosed in a pair of double quotes.


===&lt;u&gt;What is a variable?&lt;/u&gt;===

A program is made of data and instructions to manipulate those data. Note that data have to be stored somewhere, and thus will need some memory space in the RAM. 

A &lt;u&gt;'''variable'''&lt;/u&gt; is an entity that is used to store data. Without variables, there is no way (or actually NO PLACE) to store data. A variable has

* a name (more specifically a symbolic name)

* an associated physical memory space (portion in a RAM)

* a data type

* a value (depends on data type)

* a scope

* a lifetime

The concept of scope and lifetime will be discussed in the latter part of the course.


===&lt;u&gt;What is a data type?&lt;/u&gt;===

A data type specifies

* the kind of values that can be assumed by a variable of that type

* The range of values that can be assumed by a variable of that type

* the amount of memory (in bytes) needed by a variable to store a value of that type


===&lt;u&gt;What (basic) data types are available in C language?&lt;/u&gt;===

There are four basic data types, namely:

* &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; - the character data type. The &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; data type is used to represent/store/manipulate character data values. A &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; data type value requires one byte of memory space. The range of values that can be assumed by a &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; value is from 0 to 255. The number-to-character coding that is used is ASCII. 

* &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; - the integer data type. The &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; data type is used to represent/store/manipulate signed whole numeric values. 

* &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; - the single precision floating point data type. The &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; data type is used to store single precision signed real numbers(i.e., those numbers with decimal values).

* &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; - the double precision floating point data type. The &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; data type is used to store double precision signed real numbers(i.e., bigger numbers with decimal values).


The amount of memory space required to store an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, a &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;u&gt;'''platform-dependent'''&lt;/u&gt; (depends on the machine and the software). For 32-bit machines (and 32-bit compilers such as Microsoft C compiler), an &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt; requires 4 bytes of memory each, while a &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; requires 8 bytes of memory. 

Note that a &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; data is actually numeric (0 to 255), and is treated as a subset of &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt; values. Any operation (discussed later) on integer values can also be performed on characters. 


''Assignment:''

Find out what is the range of values (minimum and maximum values) for the following data types: &lt;tt&gt;int&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;double&lt;/tt&gt; on your platform. Hint: Try to look for two files named &lt;tt&gt;&quot;limits.h&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&quot;float.h&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; that comes together with your C compiler. 


===&lt;u&gt;How can you determine the actual size of each data type?&lt;/u&gt;===

The following program can be used to print the sizes of the basic data types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
     printf(&quot;Size of char: %d\n&quot;, sizeof(char));
     printf(&quot;Size of int: %d\n&quot;, sizeof(int));
     printf(&quot;Size of float: %d\n&quot;, sizeof(float));
     printf(&quot;Size of double: %d\n&quot;, sizeof(double));

     return 0;
     getch();

}
&lt;/source&gt;


The &lt;tt&gt;sizeof&lt;/tt&gt; is a keyword in C. It is an operator that yields the size in number of bytes of the specified data type shown above.

===&lt;u&gt;What is variable declaration?&lt;/u&gt;===

A variable declaration is an &quot;action&quot; by which a variable is &quot;introduced&quot; to a program/function. All variables in a C program must be declared. If you forgot to do so, the compiler will report a syntax error. 


===&lt;u&gt;How do you declare a variable?&lt;/u&gt;===

In C, the syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;data type&gt; &lt;variable name&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

 
The symbol &lt;tt&gt;&lt;item&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; means that it is required to specify the item enclosed within a pair of angled brackets. A semicolon signifies the end of a declaration. A missing semicolon will cause the compiler to generate a syntax error. Variables should be named following the C naming conventions. 

Example:

&lt;tt&gt;char ch;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;int i;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;float f;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;double d;&lt;/tt&gt;


It is possible to declare several variables of the same type on the same line. In such a case, a comma should be inserted between two variables. A missing comma will generate a syntax error. 

Example:

&lt;tt&gt;char ch1, ch2;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;int x, y, z;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;float hourly_rate, number_of_hours, salary;&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;double numerator, denominator;&lt;/tt&gt;


===&lt;U&gt;Can I use any name for the variables?&lt;u&gt;===

Yes, as long as you follow the naming conventions, and do not use the C reserved words. 

It is recommended, however, as a good programming practice for you to use a name that is descriptive or suggestive. For example, if you know that a variable will represent the hourly rate of a part-time worker, then don't use names such as &lt;tt&gt;xyz&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt; x1&lt;/tt&gt;. It is better to use a variable name such as &lt;tt&gt;rate&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;hourly_rate&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that the use of the underscore makes the variable name easy to read.

===&lt;u&gt;What is the value of the variable initially?&lt;/u&gt;===

By default, the value of a variable in C is GARBAGE, meaning there is something stored in that memory space but that something is invalid for the intended use. 

A variable must be properly initialized. By initialize, we mean assigning a valid value to a variable. The use of a variable with a garbage value will cause a logical error -- another type of error that is very difficult to find. 

Exercises:

1. Declare middle initial as a character variable

2. Declare age as an integer variable

3. Declare deposit amount, withdrawal amount as floating point variables

4. Declare length, width, height as double data type variables

=A History of This Text=
== What is a Wiki Book? ==

Wikipedia was first created as a free ongoing encyclopedia project. The idea about a collaborative encyclopedia came about to allow many different people to add information to a certain page. Wikipedia, what many consider to be the main Wiki on the web today, was founded in 2001 by volunteers and today is known as one of the largest reference sites on the web. Like many other wiki’s on the web today, visitors do not need certain qualifications to contribute information to a wiki page. The problems with this aspect of wiki books is that even though many accomplished, knowledgeable people add information to wiki’s, wiki’s could essentially be formed without any credibility.

== Creation of this Text ==
This Wikibook was created during the summer of 2008 to encourage students to create a supplemental text for the course Technical and Professional Writing offered at the University of Minnesota. This online text is suppose to serve as a substitution for having a textbook, but the overall hope is to develop the text until it is a publishing level and can be used by future students of 3562W. The Technical and Professional Writing Wikibook will help to produce a new insight into using effective communication practices by written completely by students. The Wikibook 3562W will help you to understand how to write professional. This Wikibook starts off with basic business writing techniques that will help you develop a resume, learn to write proper memos, create business documents, draft proposals, etc. The goal of the text is that tools will learn and gain from the Wikibook will help readers become not only proficient and successful writers, but also successful individuals.

== Main Focus of this Text ==
Professional and Technical Writing emphasizes teaching students to grasp a difference between the educational, practical, and business purposes one may have when writing.
* Educational- Will be read by teachers
* Practical- Will be read by co-workers, customers, and other individuals
* Business- Will be read by employers, clients, and different organizations
Technical and Professional Writing tries to prepare students for their future careers by teaching them the basic business writing strategies and techniques.



=== Philosophy ===
Student creation of a text reflects a student-centered educational philosophy. 

{a student needs to conduct interviews, and add background information}

== Classes Contributing ==
In reverse chronological order (most recent to first), these are the classes making major contributions to this text.
*ENGL3025A Technical Writing, Robert Morris University, Moon Township, PA, Spring 2012
*Writ 3562 Technical and Professional Writing, University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Spring 2010

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to my page!

Currently, I am working on some educational projects, but right now I am focusing my attention in making Programming modules. This is the module I am currently developing:


[[Fundamentals of C Programming]]


Although it is not yet finished, I'll strive to finish this as soon as possible, so that you may all read and learn the basics of C.

I'm still continuing to develop some more projects, and I hope my contributions will be a big help to you, certified Wikibookian!


This is all for now, and enjoy learning here at WikiBooks!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==NoWasteNoWant==
It is all very well building and executing &quot;mathematical&quot; or &quot;formal&quot; models.
But one must also connect with the &quot;society&quot;.
In particular one must connect with [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computers_%26_Society &quot;computers &amp; Society&quot;].
The introduction of the NoWasteNoWant garbage firm is meant to 
give a handle on that connection.

A good starting point to see what is out there (i.e., outside the &quot;Wiki&quot; world)
is to look at the courses offered by the Colleges.
So. We begin by searching on the title.

Poetry, and discussion of it, has a long history. Early attempts to define poetry, such as Aristotle's Poetics, focused on the uses of speech in rhetoric, drama, song and comedy. Later attempts concentrated on features such as repetition and rhyme, and emphasised the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from prose. From the mid-20th century, poetry has sometimes been more loosely defined as a fundamental creative act using language.

Poetry often uses particular forms and conventions to expand the literal meaning of the words, or to evoke emotional or sensual responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. Poetry's use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor and simile create a resonance between otherwise disparate images — a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.

Some forms of poetry are specific to particular cultures and genres, responding to the characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. While readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may think of it as being written in rhyming lines and regular meter, there are traditions, such as those of Du Fu and Beowulf, that use other approaches to achieve rhythm and euphony. In today's globalised world, poets often borrow styles, techniques and forms from diverse cultures and languages.

Poetry as an art form may predate literacy. Many ancient works, from the Vedas (1700–1200 BC) to the Odyssey (800–675 BC), appear to have been composed in poetic form to aid memorization and oral transmission, in prehistoric and ancient societies. Poetry appears among the earliest records of most literate cultures, with poetic fragments found on early monoliths, runestones and stelae.

[[Image:GilgameshTablet.jpg|left|thumb|The Deluge tablet of the Epic of Gilgameshin Akkadian, circa 2nd millennium BC.]]

The oldest surviving poem is the Epic of Gilgamesh, from the 3rd millennium BC in Sumer (in Mesopotamia, now Iraq), which was written in cuneiform script on clay tablets and, later, papyrus. Other ancient epic poetry includes the Greek epics, Iliad and Odyssey, the Roman national epic, Virgil's Aeneid, and the Indian epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata.

The efforts of ancient thinkers to determine what makes poetry distinctive as a form, and what distinguishes good poetry from bad, resulted in &quot;poetics&quot; — the study of the aesthetics of poetry. Some ancient societies, such as the Chinese through the Shi Jing, one of the Five Classics of Confucianism, developed canons of poetic works that had ritual as well as aesthetic importance. More recently, thinkers have struggled to find a definition that could encompass formal differences as great as those between Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Matsuo Bashō's Oku no Hosomichi, as well as differences in context spanning Tanakh religious poetry, love poetry, and rap.

Context can be critical to poetics and to the development of poetic genres and forms. Poetry that records historic events in epics, such as Gilgamesh or Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, will necessarily be lengthy and narrative, poetry used for liturgical purposes (hymns, psalms, suras and hadiths) is likely to have an inspirational tone, and elegy and tragedy are meant to evoke deep emotional responses. Other contexts include Gregorian chants, formal or diplomatic speech, political rhetoric and invective, light-hearted nursery and nonsense rhymes, and even medical texts.

Classical thinkers employed classification as a way to define and assess the quality of poetry. Notably, the existing fragments of Aristotle's Poetics describe three genres of poetry — the epic, the comic, and the tragic — and develop rules to distinguish the highest-quality poetry in each genre, based on the underlying purposes of the genre. Later aestheticians identified three major genres: epic poetry, lyric poetry and dramatic poetry, treating comedy and tragedy as subgenres of dramatic poetry.

Aristotle's work was influential throughout the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, as well as in Europe during the Renaissance. Later poets and aestheticians often distinguished poetry from, and defined it in opposition to, prose, which was generally understood as writing with a proclivity to logical explication and a linear narrative structure.

This does not imply that poetry is illogical or lacks narration, but rather that poetry is an attempt to render the beautiful or sublime without the burden of engaging the logical or narrative thought process. English Romantic poet John Keats termed this escape from logic, &quot;Negative Capability.&quot; This &quot;Romantic&quot; approach views form as a key element of successful poetry because form is abstract and distinct from the underlying notional logic. This approach remained influential into the twentieth century.

During this period, there was also substantially more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in part due to the spread of European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade. In addition to a boom in translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.

==Meter==

[[Image:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|The Old English epic poem ''Beowulf'' is written in alliterative verse and in paragraph form, not separated into lines or stanzas.]]
One defining characteristic of poetry is meter, or the pattern of stresed and unstressed syllables. These syllables are then grouped into units called &quot;feet&quot;. The feet are put together in a line that is named according to how many feet it contains. A poetic scheme is described in terms of both feet and lines. For example, iambic pentameter, used by Shakespeare, consists of lines of five feet, each foot being an iamb:

{|border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;border: #eeeecc; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
|style=&quot;background-color:#eeeecc;&quot;|''Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,''
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeecc;&quot;|''And ye that on the sands with printless foot''
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:#eeeecc;&quot;|''Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him''
&lt;/font&gt;
|} 
&lt;br&gt;





- '''The Tempest, Shakespeare, 5.1'''

==Rhyme==

In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poet forms, such as ballads, sonnets and rhyming couplets. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional rhyme schemes. Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not use rhyme. Rhyme entered European poetry in the High Middle Ages, in part under the influence of the Arabic language in Al Andalus (modern Spain). Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the sixth century, as in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the chant royal or the rubaiyat, while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.

Most rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line does not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an &quot;a-a-b-a&quot; rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form. Similarly, an &quot;a-b-b-a&quot; quatrain (what is known as &quot;enclosed rhyme&quot;) is used in such forms as the Petrarchan sonnet.

Some poetry did not rely on rhyme but on other sound devices. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures. Assonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but goes back to the Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==
[[Image:Orycteropus afer stuffed.jpg|thumb|right|280px|An Aardvark]]
The Aardvark, also known as the anteater, is a medium sized mammal that has four legs and can be found in Africa. The aardvark is pale yellowish gray in color,and often stained reddish-brown by soil. The aardvark's coat is thin and the animal's main protection is its tough skin. It has very large ears and a long snout. It has a long tongue that can be up to 30 centimeters long, and they have long claws that they dig with. Aardvarks are known for being able to dig very fast, but they are slow otherwise.

==Where does it live?==
The Aardvark can be found in it's natural habitat in Africa. It lives in grasslands, bushland, savanna, and woodland. The Aardvark is nocturnal, meaning it comes out at night and sleeps during the day. They live by themselves most of the time until they have children. They are said to be shy animals. They dig burrows with their long claws and live there with their children. In captivity Aardvark's can live up to about 10 years. The age average age it lives to be in the wild is unknown.
[[Image:Aardvarks.jpg|thumb|280px|right|An Aardvark with baby.]]
==What does it eat?==
An aardvark comes out from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and moves over a large range of land, swinging its long nose from side to side to pick up the scent of food like ants and termights. The Aardvark is a very fast digger and when a large amount of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into the dirt with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators. When the aardvark is successful in finding food, the aardvark's long sticky tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are useless because of the Aardvark's tough skin. Its hearing warns it of predators: lions, leopards, hyenas, and pythons.

==How do they defend themselves?==
The Aardvark will try to run from it's predators but when all other things fail to work they will strike with their snout, tail, and claws.</text>

==What does it look like?==
The Giraffe is the tallest of all of the land animals. Males can be 4.8 to 5.5 meters (16 to 19 feet) tall and weigh up to 1,700 kilograms (3,800 pounds). Females are slightly shorter, and weigh less than the males do. A baby giraffe weighs about 130 pounds at birth and is about 6 feet tall. Giraffes have spots covering their entire bodies, except their underbellies. Every giraffe has a unique set of spots. The front legs of a Giraffe are slightly longer than the rear legs. Giraffes have long necks, which they use to browse the leaves of trees. On their necks they have a short brown mane. They also have small horns on the top of their heads. The horns can grow to be five inches long and are used to protect the Giraffe's head when they are in a fight. Male giraffe's have horns with no hair, and female giraffe's have tufts of hair on the top of their horns.
[[Image:Giraffa camelopardalis angolensis.jpg|thumb|250px|An angolan giraffe]]
==Where does it live?==
Giraffes live in the savannas of Africa, where they roam freely among the tall trees, dry land, forests and open plains. Giraffe's are usually seen in groups.

==What does it eat?==
The giraffe is a herbivore, which means it eats no meat. Giraffe's eat the leaves of trees and sometimes other vegetables. They don't really drink a lot of water from a lake or stream because they have to spread their legs and kneel down. That places them in a dangerous position because they can't see if predators are coming. They get most of their water from the moisture of the leaves. A giraffe can eat 63 kg (140 lbs) of leaves and twigs daily.

==How does it defend itself?==
Because of the Giraffe's long necks they can see predators from a long distance away. Giraffes are also fast and can run up to 35 mph (56 kph) for short bursts. Giraffe's will raise their front legs or hit their enemy with their long necks if the predator gets too close to them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Gorilla distribution4.png|thumb|250px|Map showing location of Gorilla's in Africa.]]
==What does it look like?==
Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking on all fours. Adult males range in height from 165-175 cm (5 ft 5 in – 6ft), and in weight from 140–204.5 kg (310–450 lb). Adult females are often half the size of a silverback, averaging about 140 cm (4 ft 7 in-5ft) tall and 100 kg (220 lb). A Silverback is the name used to describe an adult male gorilla. All gorilla's have unique fingerprints.

==What does it eat==
Gorillas are herbivores, eating fruits, leaves, and bamboo shoots. Further they are classified as foliovores. Much like other animals that feed on plants and shoots, they sometimes ingest small insects also. Gorilla spend most of the day eating. Their long teeth allow them to crush hard plants like bamboo. Lowland gorillas feed mainly on fruit while Mountain gorillas feed mostly on herbs, stems and roots.
[[Image:Male silverback Gorilla.JPG|thumb|250px|Male silverback Gorilla]]

==Where do they live?==
Gorilla's can be found in a small area of Africa, in the forests. Each evening, gorillas build nests in trees in which to spend the night. Up to the age of three, the young gorilla share their mothers' nest. However, they experiment with making their own nest at an early age. Gorilla's can most of the time be seen in the company of other Gorilla's. This is because the Gorilla is a sociable animal. Gorilla's like most primates groom each other.

==How does it defend itself?==
Gorilla's defend themselves by warning off other animals and predators with a warning signal. Usually a male gorilla will stand on his back two feet, make hooting noises, and pound on it's chest.</text>

[[Image:Zebra 02.jpg|thumb|250px|]]
The zebra is known for its black and white stripes. Every zebra has a unique set of stripes. No two zebra's are exactly alike. Zebras are usually 2.3 m (8ft) long, stand 1.25-1.5 m (4-5ft) at the shoulder, and weigh around 300kg (660 lbs), although some can grow to more than 410 kg (900 lbs). They look like their closest relatives, the horse and the donkey. The have mohawk-like manes, that are also striped.

Zebras have excellent eyesight. It is believed that they can see in color. Zebras also have night vision. Zebras have great hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses. Like horses, zebra can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have a very good sense of smell and taste.

==What does it eat?==
They feed mainly on grasses but will also eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark.

==Where does it live?==

==How does it defend itself?==
When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side making it more difficult for the predator. When cornered the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.</text>

There are four different species of Hyena: The Spotted Hyena, the Brown Hyena, the Striped Hyena, and the Aardwolf. What does it look like?

==What does it eat?==
The Aardwolf eats termites, and the other three types of Hyena are hunters and scavengers.
[[Image:Crocuta-hejda.jpg|thumb|250px|]]
==Where do they live?==
With the exception of the Striped Hyena which has been seen in the jungles of India, all Hyena can be found in the arid environments like African savannahs and deserts. They can also be found in grasslands, woodlands, forest edges, subdeserts and small mountains.

== ਜਾਨਵਰ - Animals ==
[[Image:Tigerramki.jpg|thumb|300px|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera_tigris ਬਾਘ - A Bengal Tiger]]]
Animal is called ਜਾਨਵਰ in Punjabi. ਬਾਘ i.e. Tiger, a rare combination of grace, strength, agility and enormous power, is the National Animal of India. The Bengal Tiger (see picture) looks majestic.

#All the above animal names, nouns as they are, bear the noun's gender. &lt;br&gt;
#Regular masculine nouns, as in the case of first five animal names above, end with kanna(ਆ). Gender of regular masculine nouns is changed by replacing kanna(ਆ) with bihari(ਈ). &lt;br&gt;
#Regular feminine nouns, as in the case of the last four animal names above, end with bihari(ਈ). The gender of the regular feminine nouns is changed by replacing the bihari(ਈ) with kanna(ਆ). &lt;br&gt;

== ਜਾਨਵਰ - Animals continued ==
We come back to vocabulary and  present some more animals.
#ਗਾਂ = cow 
#ਮੱਝ = buffalo
#ਭੇਡ = sheep
#ਖ਼ਰਗੋਸ਼ = rabbit 
#ਸੂਰ = pig  
#ਖੱਚਰ = mule 
#ਊਠ = camel (also called ਬੋਤਾ)
#ਗਾਲੜ੍ਹ = squirrel
#ਸ਼ੇਰ = lion
#ਬਾਘ = tiger
#ਚੀਤਾ = cheetah
#ਭਾਲੂ = bear 
#ਸੱਪ = snake
#ਬਿੱਛੂ = scorpion
#ਹਿਰਨ = deer
#ਬਾਰਾਂਸਿੰਗਾ = stag
#ਗੈਂਡਾ = hippopotamus
#ਹਾਥੀ = elephant
#ਬਾਂਦਰ = monkey 
#ਲੂਮੜੀ = fox 
#ਗਿਰਗਟ = chameleon 
#ਲੰਗੂਰ = langoor  
#ਕੱਛੂਆ = tortoise 
#ਡੱਡੂ = frog 
#ਮੱਛੀ = fish 
#ਘੜਿਆਲ = aligator 
#ਮਗਰਮੱਛ = crocodile

      <text xml:space="preserve">Inference is essentially the process of creating a hypothesis of the parameters that describe a population by testing the sample parameters (such as &lt;math&gt;\hat \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat \beta&lt;/math&gt;) that we already have from a sample of the population.

For example, you have a sample of size N, and you have created a model that can be used to predict changes in the units of the sample. The parameters of this model would be estimates of the actual parameters (such as &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;) for the entire population. Inference is the process used to determine, statistically, what the parameters would be for the whole population.

There are two basic ways of checking estimates for the purposes of statistical inference
*Interval estimation
*Hypothesis testing

To successfully use these methods, one must know two things:
*The probability distribution of the true parameter values (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;) must be known.
*The formulae used must use data that can be found in the sample data (we can't successfully use unknown parameters in a function).

* '''Please make sure you follow our [[WB:NP|naming policy]]''' - modules should be named like &lt;tt&gt;Book Title/Chapter Title&lt;/tt&gt;.

* To get a page deleted, add {{tlx|delete|''your reason for requesting deletion''}} to the top of the page.
* If something you wrote was deleted, please read the [[WB:DP|deletion policy]], and check the [[Special:Log/delete|deletion log]] to find out why. Also check the [[WB:VFD|VFD]] archives if applicable. You can request undeletion at [[WB:VFU]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Welcome message ==

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:09, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

== Probably in the wrong location ==
I've noticed that you contributed a new recipe to the project [[Stollen]], but it seems it was created outside of the Cookbook name space, You can move it to another location location and then tag the remaining redirect page as to be deleted with the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag. I would do it for you but I'm not proficient with the structure of the cookbook project.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:09, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

If you have any problems make a request in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]].  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:11, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

== Changes to Italian vocabulary pages ==
I'm not an editor on that book and as such don't know what the intention was. As to help you (the editor) understand what I was pointing out, I chose not the edit consistently (since the lists were wrong in both pages, I reasoned that your were attempting to pass something more along or just causing mischief). Had I understood what was the intention I would have added (a,an) to the English nouns respectively, but the lists were marked as vocabulary and no mention was made to the gender article. I was just fixing the error on the equivalence and validating the edit.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:14, 17 August 2008 (UTC)

You could also add a page that reflect the information if it is missing (http://italian.about.com/library/fare/blfare110a.htm and http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/540/01/), I have corrected some of the other pages... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 18:07, 18 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

==1. Have the Shell Honor. ==
{{Ay prerequisite|Nature|Shells}}
==2. Define the term &quot;mollusca&quot; or &quot;mollusk.&quot; ==
The word ''mollusc'' is derived from the French ''mollusque'', which originated from the Latin ''molluscus'', meaning thin-shelled, from ''mollis'', soft.

The body of a mollusc consists of three sections; a head, with eyes or tentacles; a muscular foot; and a visceral mass housing the organs.

Both &quot;mollusc&quot; and &quot;mollusk&quot; are considered correct spelling, but ''mollusc'' seems to be the preferred spelling in scientific publications.  We therefore use the spelling ''&quot;mollusc&quot;'', though we leave spelling in requirements alone.

==3. Learn the classification terms of mollusks, know the distinguishing characteristics of each, and become acquainted with several species under each class. ==
There are ten classes of molluscs; eight of the classes have living representatives, the other two classes are known only from fossils. More than 250,000 species of mollusc are recognized and named. Snails (Gastropoda) account for about 80% of living mollusc diversity.

==4 Distinguish between univalve and bivalve mollusks from the following considerations: ==
===a. Shell   ===
The terms ''univalve'' and ''bivalve'' refer to the configuration of the shells of the molluscs.  Univalves, such as snails, have shells consisting of one (thus ''uni-'') piece.  Bivalves, such as mussels, have shells consisting of two (thus ''bi-'') pieces hinged together.

===b. Mollusk body  ===
;Univalves: Univalve bodies could almost be described as ''folded'' such that the mouth and anus both appear the shell's opening.  
;Bivalves: Bivalves on the other hand, have flattened bodies.

===c. Reproduction===
;Univalves: All land snails are hermaphrodites, producing both spermatozoa and ova. In other words, each individual is both male and female.  Some freshwater snails, such as Apple Snails, and marine species, such as periwinkles, have separate sexes; they are male and female. Most snails can mate when they are around 1 year old.

:Prior to reproduction, most land snails perform a ritual courtship before mating. This may last anywhere between two and twelve hours. Prolific breeders, pulmonate land snails inseminate each other in pairs to internally fertilize their ova. Each brood may consist of up to 100 eggs.

:Pulmonate land snails and slugs have a reproductive opening on one side of the body, near the front, through which the outer reproductive organs are extruded so that exchange of sperm can take place. After this, fertilization occurs and the eggs develop.

:Garden snails bury their eggs in shallow topsoil primarily while the weather is warm and damp, usually 5 to 10 cm down, digging with their foot. Egg sizes differ between species, from a 3 mm diameter in the grove snail to a 6 cm diameter in the Giant African Land Snail. After 2 to 4 weeks of favorable weather, these eggs hatch and the young emerge. Snails may lay eggs as often as once a month.

;Bivalves: In bivalves, the sexes are usually separate, but some hermaphroditism is known. Bivalves practice external fertilization.  External fertilization is a form of fertilization in which a zilo cell is united with an egg cell external to the body of the female. Thus, the fertilization is said to occur &quot;externally&quot;. This is distinct from internal fertilization where the union of the egg and sperm occur inside the female after insemination through copulation.

:In sexual reproduction, there must be some way of getting the sperm to the egg. Since sperm are designed to be mobile in a watery environment, aquatic molluscs can make use of the water in which they live. Eggs and sperm are simultaneously shed into the water, and the sperm swim through the water to fertilize the egg in a process known as broadcast fertilization.

===d. Movements===
[[Image:Snail climbing grass SMC 07.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Snail climbing a blade of grass]]
;Univalves: Most snails move by gliding along on their muscular foot, which is lubricated with mucus. This motion is powered by succeeding waves of muscular contraction which move down the undersurface of the foot. This muscular action is clearly visible when a snail is crawling on the glass of a window or aquarium. Snails move at a proverbially low speed (1 mm/s is a typical speed for adult ''Helix lucorum''). They produce mucus in order to aid locomotion by reducing friction, and the mucus also helps reduce the snail's risk of mechanical injury from sharp objects. This means that they can 'walk' over sharp objects like razors without being injured.

;Bivalves: Razor shells (''Ensis spp.'') can dig themselves into the sand with great speed to escape predation. Scallops can swim to escape an enemy, clapping their valves together to create a jet of water. Cockles can use their foot to leap from danger. However these methods can quickly exhaust the animal. In the razor shells the siphons can break off only to grow back later.
{{clear}}

===e. Securing food===
;Bivalves: Bivalves are unique among the molluscs for lacking a radula; they feed by siphoning and filtering large particles from water.

;Univalves: Univalves include some that are herbivores, detritus feeders, predatory carnivores, scavengers, parasites, and also a few ciliary feeders, in which the radula is reduced or absent. The radula of a univalve is usually adapted to the food that a species eats. The simplest univalves are the limpets and abalones, herbivores that use their hard radulas to rasp at seaweeds on rocks.  Many marine univalves are burrowers, and have soft siphons or tubes that extend from the mantle. Sometimes the shell has a siphonal canal to accommodate this structure. A siphon enables the animal to draw a small flow of water into their bodies. The siphon is used primarily to &quot;taste&quot; the water, in order to detect prey from a distance. Univalves with siphons tend to be either predators or scavengers.

===f. Self-preservation===
;Univalves: When retracted into their shells, many snails with gills (including many marine, some freshwater and some terrestrial species) are able to protect themselves with a door-like anatomical structure called an operculum.  Some snails hibernate during the winter (typically October through April in the Northern Hemisphere). They may also estivate in the summer in drought conditions. To stay moist during hibernation, a snail seals its shell opening with a dry layer of mucus called an epiphragm.

;Bivalves:  The radical structure of the bivalves affects their behaviour in several ways. the most significant is the use of the closely-fitting valves as a defence against predation and, in intertidal species such as mussels, drying out. The entire animal can be contained within the shell, which is held shut by the powerful adductor muscles. This defence is difficult to overcome except by specialist predators such as the Starfish and Oystercatcher.  The file shells (''Limidae'') can produce a noxious secretion when threatened, and the fan shells of the same family have a unique, acid-producing organ.

==5. Identify from shells or drawings and know the meaning of the following concho logical terms: ==
===a. Valve  ===
''Valve'' is another word for ''shell''.  This is the hard covering protecting most molluscs.

===b. Apex   ===
The apex is a word most often used to mean the tip of the spire of the shell of a gastropod. It is the first-formed, and therefore the oldest, part of the shell. To be more precise, the apex would usually be where the tip of the embryonic shell or protoconch is situated, if that is still present in the adult shell.

The word apex can also be used to refer to a similar part in other molluscan shells, however, the apex of bivalves is more usually known as the umbos, beaks or prodissoconch.

The apex of tusk shells is the small, open posterior end, and the opening itself is usually called the apical aperture.

The phrase apical whorls, or protoconch, means the whorls of the embryonic shell at the apex of the shell, especially when this is clearly distinguishable from the later whorls of the shell, otherwise known as the teleoconch.

The space under the apex of a patellate gastropod is called the apical cavity.

===c. Aperture ===
[[Image:Semicassis pyrum (base).JPG|thumb|250px|''Semicassis pyrum'', which has a large aperture.]]
The aperture is the main (or only) opening in the shell of a gastropod or snail. It is where the soft parts of the animal emerge. In some prosobranch gastropods, the aperture is able to be closed, and even completely sealed, with a sort of door or operculum.

The aperture of many snail shells is round, rounded, elliptical or oval. This shape corresponds roughly to the cross-section of the body whorl of the shell.

The aperture of a snail shell can have many other forms: semicircular, trilobate or auriculate. In some gastropods, the aperture is narrowed by protruding shell folds or &quot;bacon&quot;, which help make the soft parts of the animal less vulnerable to predation.

For convenience of reference, the apertural edge or margin of a gastropod shell is divided into three areas or walls:

* The parietal wall: the area next to the penultimate whorl of the shell
* The columellar wall: the wall next to the columella
* The palatal wall: the outer free wall of the final whorl of the shell

===d. Byssus   ===
[[Image:Zebra mussel GLERL 1.jpg|left|thumb|byssus threads on ''Dreissena polymorpha'']]
Mussels use byssus to attach to rocks and other surfaces. When a mussel's foot encounters a crevice, it creates a vacuum chamber by forcing out the air and arching up, similar to a plumber's plunger unclogging a drain. The byssus, made of keratin and other proteins, is spewed into this chamber, and bubbles into a sticky foam. By curling its foot into a tube and pumping the foam, the mussel produces sticky threads about the size of a human hair. It varnishes the threads with another protein, resulting in an adhesive.

Byssus is a remarkable adhesive that is neither degraded nor deformed by water as are synthetic adhesives. This has spurred genetic engineers to insert mussel DNA into yeast cells for translating the genes into the appropriate proteins.

===e. Foot  ===
The foot is an organ that can be extended outside the shell, and is used as a means of locomotion.  It is most common in univalves.

===f. Mantle  ===
[[Image:Loligo vulgaris.jpg|250px|thumb|European Squid (''Loligo vulgaris''). The mantle is all that is visible behind the head.]]
The mantle is an important part of the anatomy of molluscs. It is the dorsal body wall which covers the visceral mass.

In many, but by no means all, species of molluscs, the epidermis of the mantle secretes calcium carbonate and creates a shell.

The word &quot;mantle&quot; (a old word, meaning cloak) is used for this anatomical structure because in many kinds of molluscs, the edge of the mantle extends beyond the main part of the body, forming flaps or double-folded structures.
{{clear}}

===g. Operculum===
[[Image:Viviparus contectus met operculum2.JPG|right|thumb|Gastropod shell of ''Viviparus contectus'' with operculum]]
The operculum, meaning little lid, (plural: opercula or operculums) is a corneous or calcareous structure which exists in some groups of marine, freshwater, and land snails or gastropods. It is present in most but not all gastropods that have shells and gills. Pulmonate snails do not have opercula, but some terrestrial species are capable of secreting an epiphragm.

In its most typical condition, an operculum serves to close the opening or aperture of the shell when the soft parts of the animal are withdrawn into the shell.

An operculum can vary in shape greatly from one family of gastropods to another, but an operculum is fairly often circular, or more or less oval in shape. In species where the operculum fits snugly, its outline corresponds exactly to the shape of the aperture of the shell.

===h. Mother of pearl===
[[Image:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The iridescent nacre inside a Nautilus shell ]]
Nacre, also known as mother of pearl, is an organic-inorganic composite material produced by some molluscs as an inner shell layer. It is exceptionally strong, resilient, and iridescent. Nacre is found in some bivalves, some gastropods and some cephalopods. The inner shell layer in most molluscs however is merely porcellaneous, in other words shiny like a china plate, not iridescent.

Pearls and the inside layer of the pearl oyster shells and the freshwater pearl mussel shells are made of nacre. Many other families of molluscs also have an inner shell layer which is nacreous, including gastropods such as the Haliotidae, the Trochidae and the Turbinidae.
{{clear}}

===i. Epidermis===
The epidermis is the outermost layer of the mantle. In many, but by no means all, species of molluscs, the epidermis of the mantle secretes calcium carbonate and creates a shell.

===j. Ribs===
Ribs are strong, well-defined ridges on the surface of the shell.

===k. Teeth===
The radula is a toothed chitinous ribbon which is present in the mouth of most but not all classes of molluscs. It does not exist in any phyla other than the Mollusca.

The radula is usually used for scraping, cutting and chewing food before it enters the esophagus. It is present in all classes of molluscs except the bivalves.

===l. Concentric lines===
Concentric lines are circular growth rings on the outside of a shell.  Concentric rings are circles of different diameters having a common center.  Characteristics of the concentric lines (spacing, definition, etc.) can be used as an aid to identifying a mollusc.

===m. Canal===
[[Image:Penion cuvieranus cuvieranus.JPG|thumb|250px|''Penion cuvieranus cuvieranus'', showing its '''siphonal canal''' to the left.]]  
In some sea snails, (marine gastropod molluscs in the infraorder Neogastropoda), the animal has an anterior extension of the mantle called a siphon, through which water is drawn into the mantle and over the gill. This siphon is a soft fleshy tube which also serves to &quot;smell&quot; or &quot;taste&quot; the water in order to locate a possible source of food.

In many (but not all) neogastropods where the siphon is particularly long, the structure of the shell has been modified in order to house and protect the soft structure of the siphon. Thus the siphonal canal is a semitubular extension of the aperture of the shells of some marine gastropods, through which the siphon is extended when the animal is active.
{{clear}}

===n. Spines===
[[Image:Haeckel Murex pectens.jpg|thumb|130px|Venus Comb Murex, ''Murex pectens''. From Ernst Haeckel's ''Kunstformen der Natur'', 1904.]]
Spines are sharply pointed spurs protruding from a mollusc's shell.  Murexes and conches have prominent spines.

===o. Whorls===
A whorl is a single, complete 360° turn in the spiral growth of a mollusc shell. A mollusc shell is basically a long tube, usually coiled in a spiral for strength and compactness. The number of whorls in the shell depend on various factors in the geometric growth.

The number of whorls differs in various groups, with the family ''Turritellidae'' having very high spired shells with a large number of whorls and hence a relatively small aperture.

* Apical whorls—those whorls near the apex or tip of the shell.
* Body whorl—The most recently formed whorl of a spiral shell.
* Nuclear whorl(s)—small, generally smooth whorls formed within the egg and constituting the apex of the shell.
* Protoconch—a larval shell of a mollusc; also refers to protoconch whorls of an adult shell.
* Teleoconch—all the whorls of a shell after the protoconch whorls.

===p. Lips===
Lips are the curled section of shell surrounding the aperture.  Lips can curl outward, as with the conch, or inward, as with the cowrie.

==6. Explain the development of a shell. How long do mollusks live?==

Image:A fossil shell with calcite.jpg|Fossil shell covered in calcite crystals
&lt;/gallery&gt;
In those molluscs which have a shell, the shell grows gradually over the lifetime of the mollusc by the addition of calcium carbonate to the leading edge or opening, and thus the shell gradually becomes longer and wider, in an increasing spiral shape, to better accommodate the growing animal inside. The animal also thickens the shell as it grows, so that the shell stays proportionately strong for its size.

A mollusc shell is formed, repaired and maintained by a part of the anatomy called the mantle. Any injuries to or abnormal conditions of the mantle are usually reflected in the shape and form and even color of the shell. When the animal encounters harsh conditions which limit its food supply, or otherwise cause it to become dormant for a while, the mantle often ceases to produce the shell substance. When conditions improve again and the mantle resumes its task, a &quot;growth line&quot; which extends the entire length of the shell is produced, and the pattern and even the colors on the shell after these dormant periods are sometimes quite different from previous colors and patterns. 

Interestingly, within some species of mollusc there is often a surprising degree of variation in the exact shape, pattern, ornamentation, and color of the shell.

The longest lived mollusc is the ''Arctica islandica'' (Ocean Quahog).  Animals of this species close to 400 years old are not uncommon.

==7. Give some facts about the life of a ''Strombus pugilis'' (fighting conch) and explain why this shell is so named. ==
The West Indian Fighting Conch is an aggressive sea snail with a nasty sting which it uses to defend itself against marine predators.  These shells are best collected when the tide goes out, as great numbers of them suddenly emerge from the sand and retreat to the surf.  If one is flipped over, it can right itself using its sharp operculum.

==8. Explain the activities of the shipworm. ==
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Shipworm}}

==9. What accounts for the distribution of mollusks.==
molluscs have few requirements in order for them to thrive.  They need moisture, but if they find themselves in a dry environment, they are able to seal themselves (and their moisture) inside their shells until external moisture becomes available again.  Thus, molluscs can be found in nearly every habitat on Earth - even deserts!

==10. Name two mollusks that have no shells. ==
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Unknown slug on rhubarb.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Slug&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Octopus in sea life Helsinki.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Octopus&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Cuttlefish.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Cuttlefish&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Mastigoteuthis flammea.jpg|&lt;center&gt;Squid&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==11. Find answers for the following interesting questions: ==
===a. How are bivalve and univalve animals fastened to their shells? ===
The muscles of both types of molluscs attach directly to the shell.  These animals (including snails) cannot leave their shells and return any more than a turtle can leave its shell.  The shell serves as the animal's skeleton.

===b. How is shell color controlled? ===
The outer edge of a mollusc's mantle contains glands that secrete color pigments during shell formation.  These pigments control the colors on the ''outside'' of the shell.  The iridescence on the inside of the shell is caused by alternating layers of calcite and aragonite refracting different wavelengths of light by different amounts depending on the viewing angle.
[[Image:Nautilus profile.jpg|thumb|300px|The Nautilus, a mollusc with four gills]]

===c. What mollusk has four gills? ===
The '''Nautilus'' has two pairs of gills (that's four!).

===d. From what sea animal was India ink formerly made? ===
Cuttlefish have ink, like squid and octopuses. This ink was formerly an important dye, called sepia. Today artificial dyes have replaced natural sepia.

===e. What mollusk spins a silken thread? ===
Several molluscs spin a ''byssus'' which is used to anchor them to a substrate.  These include mussels in the family ''Mytilidae'' and the zebra mussel (''Dreissena polymorpha'').  However, the mollusc with perhaps the most extensive byssus is the '''rigid pen shell''' (''Atrina rigida'').  Like most pen shells, ''A. rigida'' lives in soft bottoms, with the majority of the shell buried, point down, leaving only a few inches exposed, held in place by an extensive net of byssal threads.

===f. What shells were used for money by ancient tribes? ===
Many people find the very rounded, shiny, porcelain-like shells of '''cowries''' pleasing to look at and to handle. Shells of certain species have historically been used as currency in several parts of the world, as well as being used, in the past and present, very extensively in jewelry, and for other decorative and ceremonial purposes.

===g. What shell is considered sacred by the Tibetans? ===
Tibetan Buddhists make use of a particular set of eight auspicious symbols, ''ashtamangala'', in household and public art. The '''chank shell''' or '''conch''' is one of these eight symbols:
# Conch
# Knot
# Fish
# Banner
# Lotus
# Parasol
# Urn
# Wheel

===h. Purple dye of ancient times came from the secretion of what mollusk? ===
''Hexaplex trunculus'' (also known as ''Murex trunculus'' or the '''banded dye-murex''') is a medium-sized species of sea snail.

This species of sea snail is important historically because its hypobranchial gland secretes a mucus that the ancient Canaanites/Phoenicians used as a distinctive purple-blue indigo dye. One of the dye's main chemical ingredients is indigotin, and if left in the sun for a few minutes before becoming fast, its color turns to a blue indigo (like blue jeans).

===i. What is the source of pearls? How are they formed? ===
Nacre, also known as mother of pearl, is an important part of the shell structure in many gastropod and bivalve molluscs especially the more ancient families such as top shells and pearl oysters. Like the other calcareous layers of the shell, the nacre is created by the epithelial cells (formed by the germ layer ectoderm) of the mantle tissue. mollusc blood is rich in dissolved calcium, and during shell deposition, the calcium is concentrated out from the blood and crystallized as calcium carbonate. Nacre is continually deposited onto the inner surface of the animal's shell (the iridescent nacreous layer or mother of pearl). This is done both as a means to thicken, strengthen and smooth the inner surface of the shell itself and as a defense against parasitic organisms and damaging detritus.

When a mollusc is invaded by a parasite or is irritated by a foreign object that the animal cannot eject, a process known as encystation entombs the offending entity in successive, concentric layers of inner shell material, which in some cases is nacre. This process eventually forms what we call pearls and continues for as long as the mollusc lives. Almost any species of bivalve or gastropod is capable of producing &quot;pearls&quot;, even molluscs which have no inner nacreous layer. However, only a few species, such as the famous pearl oysters, can create pearls which are highly prized.

==12. Name six commercial uses for shells. ==
;Musical Instruments: Key touches and various decorations on musical instruments such as saxophones, trumpets, violins, banjos, tamburitzas and guitars are sometimes made of mother of pearl. It is used as inlays on many guitar fretboards.
;Clothing: Mother of pearl buttons can be found on a variety of clothing such as shirts, skirts and coats. 
;Decorative Inlays: Nacre is also used as a decorative feature of watch faces, knives, guns and jewelry.
;Building Material: Instead of using a marble or tile base, the mother of pearl tesserae can be glued to a fiberglass mesh. The result is a lightweight material that offers a seamless installation, and there is no limit to the sheet size. Mother of pearl sheets may be used on interior floors, exterior and interior walls, countertops, doors and ceilings. Insertion into architectural elements, such as columns or furniture is easily accomplished.  Conch shells are occasionally used as a building material, either in place of bricks or as bulk for landfill.
;Jewelry: Pearls are highly prized jewelry components.
;Souvenirs: In some countries, cleaned Queen Conch (''Strombus gigas'') shells or polished fragments are sold, mainly to tourists, as souvenirs or in jewelry. Without a permit, however, export is a breach of CITES regulations and may lead to arrest. This is most likely to occur on return to the tourist's home country while clearing customs. In the UK conch shells are the ninth most seized import.
;Pets: Snails are often kept in aquariums along with fish.

==13. Do one of the following: &lt;br&gt;a. Personally find and collect 40 species of shells representing the five classifications. List each shell as to the place and date it was found, common name, scientific name, and class. &lt;br&gt;b. Make a collection of 50 species of shells you have found, received, or purchased representing the five classifications. List each shell collected as follows: if personally found, give the information called for under letter &quot;a&quot; above; if received or purchased, give the name of the person from whom the shell was received, the habitat of the shell, the date of its acquisition, and its common name, scientific name, and class.==
The best approach here is to get a good field guide and then try to identify the shells you have found.

The five classifications of seashells are:
;Gastropoda: (snails, conches, etc.)
;Cephalapoda: Such as ''Spirula spirula''.  Although the whole animal is rarely seen, the internal shell is very light and commonly floats ashore on beaches. The internal shell of this animal is known as the &quot;ram's horn shell&quot;.
;Bivalvia: (clams, mussels, etc.)
;Polyplacophora: (chitons)
;Scaphopoda: (tusk shells)

If you opt to purchase your collection, one possibility is to start with a kit containing specimens from all five of these classes. [http://www.seashells.com Seashells.com] carries a such a kit, reasonably-priced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0px 0px 10px 10px&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;Siu Nim Tau teaches Wing Chun concepts and basic techniques. Without the foundation provided by the concepts, you will not master Wing Chun. The techniques are useful in an unarmed fight.

==Opening==
In this part you learn the proper height and width of your stance.

===Applications===
*The Wing Chun basic stance is not a fighting posture&amp;mdash;unless you fight with your hands in your armpits&amp;mdash;but does demonstrate most of the basics that go into a proper fighting posture. Your weight is balanced in all directions, and you are ready to move in any direction. Your feet are far enough apart that you can't be pushed over easily. With your knees together you can protect your groin against kicks and knees. Your torso is upright and your are looking straight ahead. Your hands are up high enough that it takes some effort to keep them there. Even though they aren't doing anything useful right now, you have to pay attention to keep your hands in position. See the Chum Kiu form's write-up for for discussion of stances.

===Training Tips===
*Once you find your proper posture, keep your legs and torso in position throughout the form. Only your arms move in Siu Nim Tau.
#Start by standing straight with your head up, feet together, toes pointing forward, and hands at your sides. It's a loose position of attention.
#Raise your arms forward, keeping them straight, until they are at shoulder level. Form your hands into loose fists.
#Bring your hands back to the &quot;rest&quot; position, with your fists alongside your chest and almost up to your armpits. The elbows are pointing straight back and the forearms are level with the ground. Keep your torso upright throughout.
#While you are moving your arms back, get your legs into the horse stance. Bend your knees. Point your toes out, then swing your heels out. Your feet should be shoulder width apart when you are done, with the toes pointing inward. When you are in horse stance, your weight is evenly balanced left and right and forward and back. Your knees are slightly together.

==Establish Centerline==
#Double Gahn Sau, stopping with wrists together centered in front of your body. Wrists should be near waist level. Left wrist in front of right.
#Without separating wrists, raise and rotate arms to chest level, palms up. Left wrist on top of right.
#Return hands to rest position.

==Centerline Punch==
#Bring left fist to the center of your chest, about a fist and a half in front of the chest. Knuckles are up-and-down, with the wrist slightly cocked so the pinky, ring, and middle knuckles form a flat hitting surface. Keep arm muscles relaxed.
#Punch forward with the left hand. Hand moves straight forward, directly in front of your breastbone and a little below shoulder height. Punch quickly but keep your arm relaxed until the last six inches of the punch, then snap the hand forward with power. To properly execute the Wing Chun punch the arm '''must''' extend fully. Due to the slightly upward motion of the travelling fist the full extension of the arm does not damage the elbow joint if performed correctly. If there is a slight downward arcing of the fist (like with a hammer fist or backfist style strike) then the full extension of the arm will damage the elbow joint (locking out). This is how it is taught from the Ip Man -&gt; Ip Chun lineage. One can visualise this by a darts player throwing one of his darts. The arm moves to full extension in the correct motion without damaging the elbow joint.
#*''Tip'': Punch in the air to practice the motions. You can see and practice the movement more clearly if your hand isn't hitting anything.
#*''Tip'': Punch a heavy bag. After your technique is good, it's important to practice punches against a real target. It's much harder to keep the punches going so you will improve your strength and endurance. You will also train your hands and arms to take the impact. Practicing only in the air trains your muscles to pull the punch before impact, which is bad technique in a fight or competition.
#*''Tip'': Do not punch through the target. Any energy used pushing the target away is wasted and all energy should be directed toward the centre of the opponent, not through them. This is converse to styles such as Karate where breaking is practiced and one must punch through the brick. Ip-Chun demonstrates this by punching a melon. Upon opening the melon the inside is found to have become pulp.
#*''Tip'': Keep elbow in when punching. This uses the power of the large muscles of your chest. Demonstrate this by holding your fist in centerline and having someone push it toward you. Compare with pushing against your fist with your arm to the side with your elbow out&amp;mdash;a hook punch. The leg, hip and back shape is of paramount importance in absorbing the oncoming force, not just the upper body. One must make sure the entire body posture is correct in order to direct components of the oncoming force into the ground.
#*''Tip'': Three inch punch. Your arm should stay relaxed until just before impact. The power of a Wing Chun punch comes from contracting your arm muscles in the last few inches, plus shifting to put your torso's and legs' muscles into it. In training yourself to punch correctly, begin with nine-inch punches. Practice keeping your arm relaxed for most of the distance, only contracting at the end. Once you have the technique down, perform three-inch punches, contracting your muscles the entire distance. Enhance the punch by shifting into it. Advanced practitioners can work on performing one-inch punches and still put decent power into them.
#*''Tip'': Practice palm and finger strikes. The mechanics of a palm or finger strike are almost the same as for a punch. Wing Chun has four palm strikes, all demonstrated in Siu Nim Tau, and several finger strikes, of which only the eye gouge is demonstrated in Siu Nim Tau.
#Open the hand. Circle the hand around, then return to the rest position.
#*''Tip'': For the form, pause after the punch to highlight each movement. When practicing punches outside the form, and especially when sparring or fighting, pull your hand back after striking. If you leave your hand sticking out there, it can be grabbed.
#Repeat with the right hand.

==Chi Sau==

===Training Tips===
*Perform this section slowly. It should take at least thirty seconds, and thirty minutes is not unreasonable. (Yes, your arms will be tired after holding them out for fifteen minutes each. That's part of the reason for doing it so slowly.)
*Breathe normally
*As you move your arms, do not move your shoulders.
#Tan Sau with left hand, coming to centerline by the time it's extended.
#Huen Sau, then bring left hand back in a Jut Sau along centerline until it's about a fist in front of your chest.
#*''Tip'': Think of the elbow pulling your hand back. Jut Sau is done with a jerking motion, with the wrist performing the block.
#Relax left hand into a Fuk Sau and extend along centerline.
#*''Tip'': Think of the hand pulling the arm forward. This simulates riding along the opponent's arm as he retracts it.
#Huen Sau and Jut Sau as before.
#Fuk Sau as before.
#Jut Sau as before.
#Turn left hand so fingers point upward and palm is to the right. Bring hand to left shoulder then return to centerline. Extend hand forward in an upper palm strike. Turn palm up, Huen Sau, then return left hand to rest position.
#*''Application'': Use your arm when doing the palm strike to control your opponent's arm. Compare elbow position with the spade hand and choose a strike according to where your opponent's arm is.
#*''Note'': It's traditional to wu sau to your opposite shoulder. We have you go to the same shoulder because an outer wu sau combined with an upper palm strike control the opponent's arm better.
#Repeat with the right hand.

==Defend All-Around==

===Applications===
You can defend all around yourself without turning to face the attacker.

#Left hand Gum Sau next to the left hip.
#Right hand Gum Sau next to the right hip.
#Both hands strike diagonally down and backward behind waist.
#*''Application'': This can be a bladder strike against someone close behind you.
#*''Application'': The Gum Saus to the sides followed by the rear strike can break a grab around the waist from the rear.
#Perform a double Gum Sau to the front.
#*''Application'': As with most double-arm motions in Wing Chun forms, the double Gum Sau is for stylistic reasons. In a fight you will normally block with one hand while attacking with the other.
#Bring forearms horizontally up in front of face, left over right, with left hand pointing to the right and right hand pointing to the left.
#Extend arms to the sides, fingers pointed for maximum reach.
#*''Application'': This can be a block, an attack, or a &quot;keep away&quot; move.
#Bring forearms horizontally in front of face, right over left.
#*''Application'': Changing from left over right to right over left suggests the technique of pressing your opponent's arms against his chest with one arm while striking him high with the other. After the strike, drop that hand to cover the opponent's arms and strike with the formerly covering arm.
#Drop elbows and move hands forward into a double Jong Sau.
#*''Application'': Jong Sau, or Structure Hand, is the forward half of Wing Chun's Ready stance. (The rear half is Wu Sau.)
#*''Application'': Jong Sau can block an incoming centerline strike merely by being along centerline. The opponent will to go through or around your arm to hit you.
#Turn both palms up in a double Tok Sau.
#*''Application'': Tok Sau, or Elbow Lifting Hand, is used when your blocking hand is below an incoming high punch. It is a soft alternative to the hard High Bong Sau block of a hook punch.
#Turn both palms down.
#*''Application'': The arms are in the ending position of Biu Sau. Similar to Jong Sau, Biu Sau can block simply by being in the way of a punch. Biu Sau also works similarly to Tan Sau, with much of the effectiveness coming from forward motion.
#Double downward wrist block.
#*''Application'': Wrist blocks are an advanced technique because they require greater precision and power than the basics.
#*''Application'': See also Bil Jie for more applications of wrist blocks.
#Thrust fingers forward in an eye strike.
#*''Application'': one-two with a block and a strike
#Low double wrist block. (TODO - figure out the Chinese name)
#Double monkey paw strike.
#*''Application'': The monkey paw strike is similar to an upper-cut punch. It doesn't have as much power, but it has slightly longer range. Arm and elbow position are slightly different, so it might be faster to go from a block to a monkey paw rather than to an upper cut.
#Return hands to rest position.

==Wu Sau==

===Applications===
*Rear guard hand in case you miss with the front hand.
*Follow up a defensive move with an attack.

#Left hand Wu Sau to right shoulder. Return hand to centerline.
#Left hand spade hand to the front. Palm up, Huen Sau, then return to rest.
#*''Application'': You can use your striking arm to control your opponent's arm after you deflect his punch.
#Repeat with other hand.

==Tan Sau==
Cover different areas with minimal motion.

===Applications===
If your hand is high and you need to block a low strike, you can move just your forearm and hand and still cover the low area. More generally, this section demonstrates the principle of using as little effort as possible to attack and defend.

#Perform a Tan Sau with left hand, bringing hand to shoulder height.
#*''Tip'': Do not shift with the Tan Sau.
#*''Application'': Tan Sau blocks medium-to-high strikes coming from the front. The useful range is from the middle of the ribs to the top of the head.
#*''Application'': Tan Sau is often performed with a shift toward the blocking hand or with a side step away from the blocking hand. The combination of block and movement will keep you from being hit by even a powerful strike.
#*''Application'': Tan Sau is often performed with a punch with the other hand.
#Without moving anything except the left forearm, perform a left hand Gahn Sau.
#*''Application'': Gahn Sau blocks low hand strikes, from around the bottom of the ribs to around hip level.
#*''Application'': Gahn Sau is normally performed with a shift toward the blocking hand.
#Without moving anything except the left forearm, perform a left hand Tan Sau.
#*''Note'': This isn't a &quot;real&quot; Tan Sau because the arm is moving outward, not forward. The principle of Immovable Elbow is the key point.
#Huen Sau with the left hand, going from palm up to palm forward with the fingers to the left.
#Perform a left hand Side Palm Strike at rib level. Turn palm up, Huen Sau, and return left hand to rest position.
#*''Application'': It is not necessary to bring the hand back from Tan Sau position before performing the side palm strike. Beginners may wish to get the extra travel distance to gain power, but you should practice to develop power with as little travel as possible. See &quot;Three-inch Punch&quot;, above.
#Repeat the section with the right hand.

==Bong Sau==
Demonstrate how to flow around a strong attack.

===Applications===
*Relieving pressure. Because Wing Chun is usable by a smaller person against a larger, stronger one, an important principle is flowing around the opponent's strength. This is called relieving pressure. When an attack is too strong for you to block, shift, get to the other side of the strike, and let it flow past you.
*Bong Sau and Tan Sau easily flow into each other. If a punch is breaking down your Bong Sau structure, pivot the arm around the contact point to a Tan Sau and shift to facing the other way. Your new Tan Sau should steer the punch past you.

#Left hand Bong Sau. Right hand stays in rest position. Don't shift or otherwise move.
#*''Application'': The Bong Sau doesn't lend itself to a strike with the other hand. Normally you will use a Bong Sau just long enough to deflect a strike, then shift into something else. (&quot;Bong Sau comes and goes like the wind.&quot;) You may also kick while blocking.
#Left hand rolls into Tan Sau. Shoulder and wrist don't move.
#*''Application'': You can use a Bong Sau to relieve pressure from a Tan Sau as well.
#*''Application'': When actually relieving pressure from a strike, you normally shift or step to get your body out of the way. 
#After a slight pause, drop fingers and do a left hand Low Palm Strike. Palm up, Huen Sau, return left hand to rest position.
#*''Tip'': The pause is partly to point out that the Tan Sau and the Low Palm Strike are separate moves. The pause also allows you to get your hand into proper position for a hard strike and to focus your intention.
#Repeat with right hand

==Low Clearing==

===Applications===
*Relieve pressure
*Break a wrist grab
*Low block
*Attack after defensive move

#Left arm Gahn Sau, stopping with the wrist at centerline.
#*''Application'': Normally you would shift along with the block. For purposes of the form, do not shift.
#Place outer edge of right hand at outer side of left elbow, palm up. Simultaneously do four things: pull left arm to the left; twist left hand so it's palm up; scrape right hand down left forearm; rotate right hand to palm down.
#*''Application'': The simultaneous move-and-twists are for escaping a grab. If you can, start breaking the grab before it's firm on your arm; it's much harder to get away from a grip than from a reach.
#Repeat, switching left and right.
#Repeat the first way.
#Three quick centerline punches, left right left.
#*''Tip'': Thousand punches: Perform 100 punches, alternating hands. Leave a slight pause between each punch. After the 100, shake it out and rest a moment. Then perform 200 punches, two at a time. Punches can alternate hands or be with the same hand. If you punch twice in a row with the same hand, make sure each punch has proper form and each punch has a snap. After the 100 sets of two, shake it out and rest a moment. Then perform 300 punches, 100 sets of three. Rest. Then perform 400 punches, 100 sets of four. This exercise trains you to punch rapidly yet forcefully&amp;mdash;very useful in competition or fights. Don't start practicing this until you have good form for your punch. Otherwise you'll just be practicing bad form.
#*''Application'': Multiple attacks&amp;mdash;don't rely on a single powerful strike.
#*''Application'': More generally, Wing Chun does not rely on size or power to block or strike. If a move cannot be successfully performed by a small woman against a large man, it's not being done right.

==Closing==
#Bring your hands back from punching position and cross your wrists in front of your chest. Continue bringing your fists back, up, and forward, dropping your elbows as you do so. Bring your fists back to the rest position. At the same time straighten your legs, bring your left foot to the right, and push your hands down past your hips. You will end up in a loose position of attention, the same as the starting position and a few inches to the right.

==Training Tips==
*Perform the form with the &quot;warrior mind&quot;. Think of how to apply each move. Imagine an attack coming and picture yourself blocking it. Most importantly, don't simply go through the form's motions while you're thinking about work or your favorite TV show.
*Once you have learned Siu Nim Tau, practice it in different positions. Practicing in deep horse stance is an obvious variant, strengthening your legs without needing other changes. Doing the form while sitting lets you get practice in when you have a few minutes to kill. It also trains you to fight while sitting, which is a useful skill.

==Key Points==
*Wing Chun forms are textbooks, not mock fights. While the forms in many other martial arts run through a series of moves as if you were going against an opponent, Wing Chun forms simply demonstrate the concepts and basic moves of the style. If you're ever practicing or looking for holes in your personal style, go back to the forms. Look for basic moves that you're leaving out. Review your technique in light of the concepts.
*Wing Chun is designed so a smaller person can defeat a larger, stronger attacker. Most techniques are designed around this principle: flow around the opponent, using soft blocks rather than hard, relieving pressure rather than resisting it, using many lighter punches rather than a single fight-ending power punch. If a technique will not work for a smaller person fighting against a larger, it's not Wing Chun.
*There are several difficulties in Siu Nim Tau. First of all, this is the first Wing Chun form you learn. Many Wing Chun concepts, such as center line theory, are not common. Whether or not you have other martial arts experience, it may take a while to fit these concepts into your style.
*Wing Chun has a great many blocks. Many of them are variations on a theme, and almost all of them work on the principle of gently steering an opponent's attack away from center line. Which block to use depends on where the attack is coming from and where your hands are in relation to the attack. You do not plan ahead to use a Bong Sau followed by a Tok Sau to block the next two attacks; you use whatever block comes naturally from positioning.
*Performing Siu Nim Tau is both easy and difficult. It is easy compared to other forms&amp;ndash;no jumping, no difficult timing between moves. On the other hand, the form is so clean and straightforward that every move has to be precise, a balance between crispness and smooth flow. If you are performing in front of an experienced practitioner, you'll have to be good. Any mistakes will be obvious because there is nothing to distract the audience.
*Wing Chun is not a &quot;sided&quot; style. All moves in Siu Nim Tau are performed with each hand, either simultaneously or one after the other. (Normally they will not be performed simultaneously outside the form. Simultaneous execution is only for demonstration of technique.) This carries through to later forms, where almost all techniques are demonstrated to both sides. (The few which aren't done on both sides could be.)

Chum Kiu's major new feature is legwork. It demonstrates moving to an opponent, turning to face an opponent, and kicking.

==Opening==
In this part you learn the proper height and width of your stance.

===Applications===
The Ving Tsun basic stance is not a fighting posture&amp;mdash;unless you fight with your hands in your armpits&amp;mdash;but does demonstrate most of the basics that go into a proper fighting posture. Your weight is balanced in all directions, and you are ready to move in any direction. Your feet are far enough apart that you can't be pushed over easily. With your knees together you can protect your groin against kicks and knees. Your torso is upright and your are looking straight ahead. Your hands are up high enough that it takes some effort to keep them there. Even though they aren't doing anything useful right now, you have to pay attention to keep your hands in position.

===Training Tips===
Perform the form with the &quot;warrior mind&quot;. Think of how to apply each move. Imagine an attack coming and picture yourself blocking it. Most importantly, don't simply go through the form's motions while you're thinking about work or your favorite TV show.

Once you find your proper posture, keep your legs and torso in position throughout the form. Only your arms move in Siu Nim Tau.

===Notes===
The opening, centerline, and punch sections are the same as in Siu Nim Tau. They are repeated in Chum Kiu to emphasize their importance.

#Start by standing straight with your head up, feet together, toes pointing forward, and hands at your sides. It's a loose position of attention.
#Raise your arms forward, keeping them straight, until they are at shoulder level. Form your hands into loose fists.
#Bring your hands back to the &quot;rest&quot; postion, with your fists alongside your chest and almost up to your armpits. The elbows are pointing straight back and the forearms are level with the ground. Keep your torso upright througout.
#While you are moving your arms back, get your legs into the horse stance. Bend your knees. Point your toes out, then swing your heels out. Your feet should be shoulder width apart when you are done, with the toes pointing inward. When you are in horse stance, your weight is evenly balanced left and right and forward and back. Your knees are slightly together.

==Establish Centerline==
#Double gahn sau, stopping with wrists together centered in front of your body. Wrists should be near waist level. left wrist in front of R.
#Without separating wrists, raise and rotate arms to chest level, palms up. left wrist on top of right.
#Return hands to rest position.

==Centerline Punch==
#Bring left fist to the center of your chest, about a fist and a half in front of the chest. Knuckles are up-and-down, with the wrist slightly cocked so the pinky, ring, and middle knuckles form a flat hitting surface. Keep arm muscles relaxed.
#Punch forward with the left hand. Hand moves straight forward, directly in front of your breastbone and a little below shoulder height. Punch quickly but keep your arm relaxed until the last six inches of the punch, then snap the hand forward with power.
#Open the hand. Circle the hand around, then return to the rest position.
#Repeat with the right hand.

==Turning==
Face opponents in different directions. Move your hands to attack and defend in the new centerline.

#Thrust both hands out to North in a double Jong Sau.
#*''Application'': Jong Sau can block an incoming strike simply by putting your arm where your opponent needs to put his arm.
#*''Application'': You wouldn't use both hands in a double Jong Sau in a fight. Doubled hands are purely for the form.
#Bring forearms in so left lies atop right. Shift left to face West, then shift right to face East, then shift left to face West again.
#*''Tip'': Don't turn too far when making side elbow strikes. Practice with your back against a wall as you shift with the elbow strikes; when your upper arm hits the wal you have the correct amount of shifting.
#*''Application'': Both the upper arm and the forearm sides of the elbow can be used in striking.
#*''Application'': Elbow strikes are very close range attacks. Especially when you have a new opponent coming in from the side, avoid letting him get so close before turning to deal with him.
#Shoot both hands to West in a double Biu Sau. Pause, then turn left hand palm up to a Tok Sau and slap right palm down on left forearm. Repeat with right Tok Sau, then repeat again with left Tok Sau. Perform three Spade Hands, Left-Right-Left. The hand not doing a spade hand should be in a rear-guard position.
#*''Tip'': You can shoot your hands out in Biu Sau, Jong Sau, or Spade Hand. Any of these will demonstrate the concept of the move in the form. If you have an instructor, go with his preference, of course.
#Shift to face East, bringing right arm up in a side elbow strike. Fingers should be pointed. Left hand goes to rest position.
#*''Tip'': Shift with power.
#*''Application'': The elbow strike is a very short-range attack, so it's better to notice and respond to an opponent before he gets so close.
#Bring left hand up near right shoulder, hand open. Look North then shift to face North, bringing right arm up into a North-facing Bong Sau and left hand in Wu Sau.
#Repeat the previous two moves twice.
#With the right hand, make a grabbing motion as if grabbing the opponent's collar, then pull right hand to right armpit while punching to East with left hand.
#Shift left to face West, drawing left hand in to right shoulder before whipping it out to West.
#Shift right to face North, bringing left hand into centerline with Jut Sau.
#Brush right hand along left arm while bringing left hand back to rest position. Right hand ends with fingers thrusting to opponent's throat. Turn right hand palm up, Huen Sau, then bring right hand back to rest position.
#Repeat the section to the other side.

==Move and Defend==
#Bring left hand up near right shoulder. Shift left to face West, bringing left elbow up to shoulder height and then outward so upper arm points straight to the West. Weight is mostly on the right leg. left leg is turned slightly inward. left forarm is horizontal and points North, and left wrist and hand are straight, with fingers pointing North.
#*''Application'': Bringing the left hand up is not a fighting move. It serves only to bring the elbow forward from its rest position.
#*''Application'': When fighting, put the right hand in a guard position to protect ribs and abdomen.
#*''Application'': Forward leg is turned inward to protect against kicks to the knee or groin.
#*''Application'': Elbow strikes are very powerful. Elbows are a short ranged attack, so protecting your vitals is important.
#Forward kick to the West with left foot. As foot comes down, turn head to face North. Bring right arm up into North-facing Bong Sau and left hand into Wu Sau to protect right ribs. Shuffle right foot slightly to the West to regain proper West-facing posture.
#*''Application'': Kicking in one direction and blocking in another shows a way to fight multiple opponents.
#*''Application'': Stepping West while blocking North shows how to step away from an attack. A Bong Sau done in this way would deflect a punch into the direction that you're stepping. TODO
#*''Application'': Wing Chun kicks have a lot of power behind them. Kicking West and then stepping West demonstrates advancing to the opponent to keep him in attack range.
#Let arms relax so hands are together, palm up, near right hip. Shuffle step to West, bringing right arm up into North-facing Bong Sau and left hand up into Wu Sau near right ribs.
#*''Tip'': What to do with your hands when relaxing varies between instructors
#Let arms relax so hands are together, palm up, near right hip. Shuffle step to West, bringing right arm up into North-facing Bong Sau and left hand up into Wu Sau near right ribs.
#Bring right fist into uppercut to West while bringing left hand back to rest position. Shift to face North, bringing right hand into Jong Sau. Whisk left hand over the top of right arm while pulling right hand back to rest position. Left hand continues North into a finger strike to the throat.
#*''Application'': After dealing with the opponent to the West, shift to deal with an opponent in a new direction. This establishes a new centerline and you should move your hands into centerline.
#*''Application'': Jong Sau is one of many ways to bring a hand to a new centerline. It works in this instance because the right hand is slightly high from the uppercut. The Bil Jie form shows many ways to leave and return to centerline.
#Left hand turns palm up, then Huen Sau and pull back to rest position.
#Repeat this section in the other direction. You should end up in the same spot you started from.

==Move and Attack==
Move into range to attack an opponent.

#Shift to face West. Forward kick with left leg, about waist-high, keeping your hands in rest position. Plant your left foot forward (to West) with knee turned in. At the same time, move both hands into a double low Bong Sau facing West.
#*''Tip'': Practice keeping your leading knee turned in slightly as you move around.
#*''Application'': When you kick, you normally keep your hands up to block if your kick doesn't work.
#*''Application'': The turned-in knee protects your crotch from snap kicks and somewhat protects the knee from straight kicks.
#Pull hands back from the low Bong Sau, shuffle-step forward (to West) and push hands out into a double Tan Sau. Repeat the Bong, Tan, Bong, Tan moves, shuffle-stepping with each block.
#*''Application'': As is almost always the case, you won't use two Tan Saus or two Bong Saus together. Most likely you would block with one hand while closing and either punch or perform a secondary move with the other hand. For instance, you might use Bong Sau to block a punch as you advance, then grab the opponent's punching arm with a Lop Sau and punch as you continue to advance.
#Starting with hands in double Tan Sau, turn hands to face down into a Biu Sau, with fingers still pointing to West. At the same time, take a small step forward with left foot. Bring right foot up to left foot, moving body forward but keeping hands in place. Drop wrists and elbows so palms are facing West. Thrust both hands to West in a double palm strike, then bring hands back to rest position.
#*''Application'': Use a double Palm Strike or Po Pai Chun to push an opponent away.
#*''Application'': Bringing your feet together is only for the form, as a set up for the turn which follows. This is not a good idea in a fight.
#Turn around to face East by placing left toe tip behind right foot and then pivoting on left toe and right heel. End up in the same position but facing the other way.
#*''Tip'': This move is the same as a military About Face.
#Forward kick with right leg, about waist-high, keeping your hands in rest position. Plant your right foot forward (to East) with knee turned in. At the same time, move both hands into a double low Bong Sau facing East.
#Pull hands back from the low Bong Sau, shuffle-step forward (to East) and push hands out into a double Tan Sau. Repeat the Bong, Tan, Bong, Tan moves, shuffle-stepping with each block.
#Starting with hands in double Tan Sau, turn hands to face down into a Biu Sau, with fingers still pointing to East. At the same time, take a small step forward with right foot. Bring left foot up to right foot, moving body forward but keeping hands in place. Drop wrists and elbows so palms are facing East. Thrust both hands to East in a double palm strike, then bring hands back to rest position.
#Look over left shoulder to West, then perform a side/rear kick to West. Plant left foot a shoulder width to the West of your right foot, toes angled right (NE) so you're shifted to the right. As the left foot comes down, left hand comes down to a Gum Sau. Shift left (NW), simultaneously bringing left hand up to Wu Sau and performing Gum Sau with right hand. Shift right (NE), simultaneously bringing right hand up to Wu Sau and performing Gum Sau with left hand.
#*''Tip'': For purposes of the form, keep your hands in rest position during the kick.
#*''Application'': Keep your hands up during a kick. If you miss, you'll want to be able to block whatever's coming your way. When doing a side kick, a Bong Sau or Muen Sau on the kicking side puts your arm in a good position. Bring the other hand into a low Wu Sau to protect the abdomen and short ribs.
#Shift to North. Perform center punch left - right - left.
#*''Application'': Wing Chun is not geared towad one powerful punch dropping an opponent. Instead, the focus is on avoiding or diverting his attacks while wearing him down with multiple strikes of your own.

==Closing==
Bring your hands back from punching position and cross your wrists in front of your chest. Continue bringing your fists back, up, and forward, dropping your elbows as you do so. Bring your fists back to the rest position. At the same time straighten your legs, bring your left foot to the right, and push your hands down past your hips. You will end up in a loose position of attention, the same as the starting position and a few inches to the right.

==Training Tips==
In this form we introduce the compass to tell you what way to face. Unless indicated otherwise, you start the form facing North.

==Key Points==
;Shifting
:Shifting is turning without changing your feet's location. A main purpose is to let an attack slip past you without hitting you. When you combine a soft block such as a Tan Sau with a shift, you can use minimal energy to steer your opponent's punch outside your shoulder, causing him to waste all of his energy. Shifting moves your centerline only a little, but it makes you narrower. Shifting also lets you turn to face your opponent if he moves, or to face a new opponent. Finally, shifting adds power and reach to a punch or palm strike.
;Stepping
:Stepping means moving your feet to change your position. (That should be obvious from the name, but I'm distinguishing from shifting.) Stepping in Wing Chun is normally used to move closer to or away from an opponent or to side-step a rushing attack. You can step straight in any direction. The first foot to move is the one already leading in the direction you're going. Make sure not to cross your feet. That is, don't walk normally.
;Distance
:The distance to your opponent determines what kind of attack to use. Side kicks and finger strikes are long-range attacks, front kicks and straight punches have slightly shorter range, palm strikes are shorter still, and elbows and knees have very short range. Conversely, the distance restricts your opponent's possible attacks. You can step forward and backward to adjust the distance to your liking.
;Coordination of hands and feet
:Learning the proper timing of your hands and feet lets you add power to strikes and avoid throwing off your own balance.
;Kicking
:Wing Chun kicking attacks are powerful stamping kicks. There are no fancy angles or snaps. Just bring your knee up (&quot;chambering&quot;) and stamp out with the sole of your foot as if you are kicking open a door. Kicks can go to the front, to the side, or to the rear. The rear kick has the same mechanics as the side kick.

Bil Jie demonstrates the paired concepts of leaving centerline and returning. It introduces many new techniques, many of which are more dangerous than the techniques in Siu Nim Tau or Chum Kiu.

Bil Jie is the third and last of the traditional Wing Chun forms. Like Siu Nim Tau and Chum Kiu, Bil Jie is a textbook, teaching both principles and techniques. (The three remaining forms teach and practice techniques, but not principles.)

The core principle of Bil Jie is leaving and returning to centerline. The key techniques are more lethal attacks.

Some instructors, the more traditional ones, regard Bil Jie as secret, to be revealed only to special students who have been chosen to receive the full Wing Chun training and carry on the lineage. If you suspect your instructor is one of these, be careful in revealing any Bil Jie knowledge.

==Opening==
In this part you learn the proper height and width of your stance.

===Applications===
The Wing Chun basic stance is not a fighting posture&amp;mdash;unless you fight with your hands in your armpits&amp;mdash;but does demonstrate most of the basics that go into a proper fighting posture. Your weight is balanced in all directions, and you are ready to move in any direction. Your feet are far enough apart that you can't be pushed over easily. With your knees together you can protect your groin against kicks and knees. Your torso is upright and your are looking straight ahead. Your hands are up high enough that it takes some effort to keep them there. Even though they aren't doing anything useful right now, you have to pay attention to keep your hands in position. See the Chum Kiu form's write-up for for discussion of stances.

===Training Tips===
Once you find your proper posture, keep your legs and torso in position throughout the form. Only your arms move in Siu Nim Tau.

#Start by standing straight with your head up, feet together, toes pointing forward, and hands at your sides. It's a loose position of attention.
#Raise your arms forward, keeping them straight, until they are at shoulder level. Form your hands into loose fists.
#Bring your hands back to the &quot;rest&quot; postion, with your fists alongside your chest and almost up to your armpits. The elbows are pointing straight back and the forearms are level with the ground. Keep your torso upright througout.
#While you are moving your arms back, get your legs into the horse stance. Bend your knees. Point your toes out, then swing your heels out. Your feet should be shoulder width apart when you are done, with the toes pointing inward. When you are in horse stance, your weight is evenly balanced left and right and forward and back. Your knees are slightly together.

==Punches==
#Circle Step inside to outside with left leg. End in the same position as you started.
#*''Tip'': Practice with the floor dummy to build speed and power with circle steps.
#*''Application'': Get closer to an opponent, going around his forward leg.
#*''Application'': Break down the opponent's footing by folding or breaking his knee, or at least by limiting his forward leg's mobility.
#*''Application'': Go around an opponent. If you are between multiple opponents, usually it's best to move around one and put him in the middle. This is not expressly shown in the form, as Bil Jie keeps you in one place.
#Repeat with the right leg.
#Punch with the left hand straight from the rest position to centerline.
#*''Tip'': Practice all of the Siu Nim Tau punch training tips with the Bil Jie punch.
#*''Application'': Attack from off centerline. If your opponent is protecting centerline, an angle punch may go around his defense rather than through them.
#*''Application'': If your hand is off centerline, an angle punch may be quicker than bringing your hand in before punching.
#Open fist so palm is facing right and fingers are pointing forward. Jerk wrist up and then down three times. Turn palm down and jerk wrist left and then right three times.
#*''Tip'': Strengthen your wrists.
#*''Tip'': Strengthen and toughen your fingertips.
#*''Application'': Wrist block
#*''Application'': Shooting fingers
#Left hand palm up, Huen Sau, and return to rest position.
#Repeat punch, wrist action, and return with the right hand.

==Bil Jie Elbows (technique)==
#Circle Step with the left leg, inside to out. Circle Step with the right leg, inside to out.
#*''Tip'': Move your leg quickly and energetically, especially on the forward arc. This helps you gain surprise and momentum when stepping close to an opponent and breaking down his leg structure.
#*''Application'': Elbow strikes are a very short-ranged attack. You will have to get close to your target. Circle steps are used to get around an opponent's forward leg.
#*''Application'': The motion of the circle step can also be an attack against the opponent's forward knee.
#Bil Jie Elbow with right arm to the left. Shift left with the strike so you are facing West.
#*''Tip'': The left arm stays in rest position to make the motion of the Bil Jie Elbow clear.
#*''Tip'': Lean back slightly as your elbow goes overhead. This helps the arc stay vertical rather than a high horizontal.
#Bil Jie Elbow with left arm to the right. Shift right so you are facing East.
#Bil Jie Elbow with right arm to the left. Wu Sau with left hand under the right armpit to protect the ribs. Shift left so you are facing West.
#Thrust the left hand straight out to the West in a Biu Jie Sau. Thrust the right hand straight out to the West in a Biu Jie Sau. Step forward with the right foot so your feet are together, at the same time bringing hands to rest position.
#Circle step with the right foot inward to outward and shift to North, ending with the right foot somewhat to the right. Circle step with the left foot outward to inward, ending in the Wing Chun basic stance.
#*''Tip'': You should end this section in the same position as you began it.
#Repeat the elbow strikes and the closing circle steps in the opposite direction.

==Bil Jie Elbows (power)==
The Bil Jie Elbow is a very powerful strike. It will not usually be necessary to strike repeatedly with it.

#Circle Step with the left leg, inside to out. Circle Step with the right leg, inside to out.
#*''Tip'': Move your leg quickly and energetically, especially on the forward arc. This helps you gain surprise and momentum when stepping close to an opponent and breaking down his leg structure.
#*''Application'': Elbow strikes are a very short-ranged attack. You will have to get close to your target. Circle steps are used to get around an opponent's forward leg.
#*''Application'': The motion of the circle step can also be an attack against the opponent's forward knee.
#Bil Jie Elbow with right arm to the left. Wu Sau with left hand under the right armpit to protect the ribs. Shift left so you are facing West.
#Thrust the left hand straight out to the West in a Biu Jie Sau. Thrust the right hand straight out to the West in a Biu Jie Sau. Step forward with the right foot so your feet are together, at the same time bringing hands to rest position.
#Circle step with the right foot inward to outward and shift to North, ending with the right foot somewhat to the right. Circle step with the left foot outward to inward, ending in the Wing Chun basic stance.

Bring your fists back to the rest position. At the same time straighten your legs, bring your left foot to the right, and push your hands down past your hips. You will end up in a loose position of attention, the same as the starting position and a few inches to the right.

==Key Points==

*Leave center and return to center. You will often need to move your hands away from centerline. You might need to block a wide punch or you might need to deal with a new opponent. You should then return to centerline as soon as possible - centerline is a key Wing Chun concept for a reason, after all. The return can be by simply moving your arm, attacking, blocking, or moving your body so centerline moves to where your arm is.
*Multiple opponents. If you have multiple opponents, try to move so only one at a time is in attack range. If several are in range at the same time, deal with one and then shift centerline to deal with the next. If necessary, leave centerline to block an attack.
*Dangerous techniques. Bil Jie introduces several techniques which are dangerous to you or to your opponent.
*Focused power. Several Bil Jie techniques rely on your ability to focus a great deal of power quickly. An example is the wrist block. Beginners, even if they are strong in the weightlifting sense, usually will not be able to concentrate power sharply enough to be useful for these techniques. It takes many hours of practice to train your body to deliver a burst of power.
*Advanced techniques aren't necessarily better than basics. Even after you've been studying Wing Chun for ten years, Tan Sau still works just fine, and quite likely better than more advanced moves. The advanced moves simply put tools in your toolbox; use them when they are the best tool for the job, not simply because they're in the toolbox.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Book Creation Notes ==

I created the book content as XML files, which I transform into HTML, wiki, or PDF through XSL stylesheets. I've got a printable PDF version of the whole book, but it looks as if it were laid out by a brain-damaged monkey with cataracts. I'm trying to get DocBook running on my home system so I can revise the native XML and get a PDF I'm not ashamed of. The final printable version will also have photos.

As edits are made in the wikibook, I'll figure out how to import wiki edits back into the source XML to make a revised PDF.

Siu Nim Tau is fully written and annoted as I intended, with lots of application suggestions, practice tips, and the like. I have the steps of the other forms mostly written, but with fewer extras. Extras take longer to write than the steps, so I may put up the &quot;bare&quot; forms and see if anyone wants the extras. Comments requested.

== Lineage ==

As noted on the front page, the forms I learned come down from Moy Yat. Lineage is often a touchy subject among martial artists. I suggest that if anyone has a different version of a form we put subsections under the The Forms section. [[User:SteveF|SteveF]] ([[User talk:SteveF|talk]]) 03:25, 15 August 2008 (UTC)

== Combat Ving Tsun ==

I would like to thank my friend &amp; student Steve Furlong for putting such a comprehensive translation of the Wing Chun forms for the public to learn and reference. I have been studying wing chun since 1993 and have been helping Steve F in his journey since 2002. We do have a live school in the Glenville NY area which is about 20 minutes outside of Albany. Feel free to stop by and have a free lesson if you're in the area. Below is the website of my school and my Sifu's school. If you are ever in the Rochester NY area make sure you look up Sigung for a lesson as well. Thank you and enjoy!

6.Bxc6!? is an interesting move. It may look like a waste of time. The main line goes 6.- dxc6 7.Qe1! and black has a couple of problems here:
1.7.- Bd6?! leads to 8.d4! and if exd4?, 9.e5!. If black plays 8.- Qe7, white plays 9.dxe5! which leads to: 9.- Bxe5 10.Nxe5 Qxe5 11.Qc3 Ng4 12.Qxe5+ Nxe5 13.f4! Ng6 14.f5!(14.Be3 is also good) Ne5 15.Bf4 and white stands much better because of his better pawn structure.
2.7.- f6 is impossible because there is a knight on f6.
The best move is probably 7.- Qd6.

      <comment>/* Implementing interfaces */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{The Zope 3 Book/Navigation|Getting Started|Component Architecture}}

== Introduction ==

Interfaces are objects that specify (document) the external behavior of objects that &quot;provide&quot; them.  An interface specifies behavior through:

* Informal documentation in a doc string
* Attribute definitions
* Invariants, which are conditions that must hold for objects that provide the interface

Some of the motivations for using interfaces are:

* Avoid monolithic design by developing small, exchangeable pieces
* Model external responsibility, functionality, and behavior
* Establish contracts between pieces of functionality
* Document the API

The classic software engineering book [[w:Design Patterns|Design Patterns]] by the ''Gang of Four'' recommends that you ''Program to an interface, not an implementation''.  Defining a formal interface is helpful in understanding a system. Moreover, interfaces bring you all the benefits of Zope Component Architecture.

In some modern programming languages: Java, C#, VB.NET etc, interfaces are an explicit aspect of the language. Since Python lacks interfaces, Zope implements them as a meta-class to inherit from.

== Types of Contract ==

;&quot;I can do X&quot;: Describing the ability to do something is the classical definition of an API. Those abilities are defined and implemented as methods.

;&quot;I have X&quot;: This statement declares the availability of data, which is classically associated with schemas. The data is stored in attributes and properties.

;&quot;You can do X with me&quot;: Here we describe the behavior of an object. Classically there is no analog. However, MIME-types are great example of behavior declaration. This is implemented using empty &quot;marker interfaces&quot; as they describe implicit behavior.

The distinction between those three types of contracts was first pointed out in this form by Philipp von Weitershausen.

Understanding those distinctions is very important, since other programming languages do not necessarily use all three of these notions. In fact, often only the first one is used.

== Defining Interfaces ==

* Python has no concept of interfaces
* Not a problem
* Interfaces are just objects
* &quot;Abuse&quot; the class statement to create an interface
* Syntax proposed in PEP 245

Jim Fulton does not see this as a problem, since it makes interfaces first class citizens. In Java, for example, interfaces are special types of objects that can only serve as interfaces in their intended, limited scope.

An interface from the zope.interface package, on the other hand, defines the interface by implementing a meta-class, a core concept of Python. Thus, interfaces are merely using an existing Python pattern.

== An example ==

Here is a classic hello world style example:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Host(object):
...
...     def goodmorning(self, name):
...         &quot;&quot;&quot;Say good morning to guests&quot;&quot;&quot;
...
...         return &quot;Good morning, %s!&quot; % name
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above class, you defined a goodmorning method. If you call the goodmorning method from an object created using this class, it will return Good morning, ...!

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; host = Host()
&gt;&gt;&gt; host.goodmorning('Jack')
'Good morning, Jack!'
&lt;/source&gt;

Here host is the actual object your code uses. If you want to examine implementation details you need to access the class Host, either via the source code or an [[w:Application_programming_interface|API]] documentation tool.

Now we will begin to use the Zope interfaces.  For the class given above you can specify the interface like this:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from zope.interface import Interface

&gt;&gt;&gt; class IHost(Interface):
...
...     def goodmorning(guest):
...         &quot;&quot;&quot;Say good morning to guest&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see, the interface inherits from zope.interface.Interface. This use (abuse?) of Python's class statement is how Zope defines an interface. The I prefix for the interface name is a useful convention.

== Declaring interfaces ==

You have already seen how to declare an interface using zope.interface in previous section. This section will explain the concepts in detail.

Consider this example interface:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from zope.interface import Interface
&gt;&gt;&gt; from zope.interface import Attribute

&gt;&gt;&gt; class IHost(Interface):
...     &quot;&quot;&quot;A host object&quot;&quot;&quot;
...
...     name = Attribute(&quot;&quot;&quot;Name of host&quot;&quot;&quot;)
...
...     def goodmorning(guest):
...         &quot;&quot;&quot;Say good morning to guest&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The interface, IHost has two attributes, name and goodmorning. Recall that, at least in Python, methods are also attributes of classes. The name attribute is defined using zope.interface.Attribute class. When you add the attribute name to the IHost interface, you don't set an initial value. The purpose of defining the attribute name here is merely to indicate that any implementation of this interface will feature an attribute named name. In this case, you don't even say what type of attribute it has to be!. You can pass a documentation string as a first argument to Attribute.

The other attribute, goodmorning is a method defined using a function definition. Note that self is not required in interfaces, because self is an implementation detail of class. For example, a module can implement this interface. If a module implements this interface, there will be a name attribute and goodmorning function defined. And the goodmorning function will accept one argument.

Now you will see how to connect interface-class-object. So object is the real living thing, objects are instances of classes. And interface is the actual definition of the object, so classes are just the implementation details. This is why you should program to an interface and not to an implementation.

Now you should familiarize yourself with two more terms to understand other concepts. The first one is &quot;provide&quot; and the other one is &quot;implement&quot;. Object ''provides'' interfaces and classes ''implement'' interfaces. In other words, objects provide interfaces that their classes implement. In the above example, host (object) provides IHost (interface), and Host (class) implements IHost (interface). One object can provide more than one interface; also one class can implement more than one interface. Objects can also provide interfaces directly, in addition to what their classes implement.

;Note: Classes are the implementation details of objects. In Python, classes are callable objects, so why can't other callable objects implement an interface? Yes, it is possible. For any callable object you can declare that it produces objects that provide some interfaces by saying that the callable object implements the interfaces. The callable objects are generally called &quot;factories&quot;. Since functions are callable objects, a function can be an implementer of an interface.

== Implementing interfaces ==

To declare a class implements a particular interface, use the function zope.interface.implements in the class statement.

Consider this example, here Host implements IHost:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from zope.interface import implements

&gt;&gt;&gt; class Host(object):
...
...     implements(IHost)
...
...     name = u''
...
...     def goodmorning(self, guest):
...         &quot;&quot;&quot;Say good morning to guest&quot;&quot;&quot;
...
...         return &quot;Good morning, %s!&quot; % guest
&lt;/source&gt;

;Note: If you wonder how implements function works, refer the blog post by James Henstridge (http://blogs.gnome.org/jamesh/2005/09/08/python-class-advisors/) . In the adapter section, you will see an adapts function, it is also working similarly.

Since Host implements IHost, instances of Host provide IHost. There are some utility methods to introspect the declarations. The declaration can write outside the class also. If you don't write interface.implements(IHost) in the above example, then after defining the class statement, you can write like this:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from zope.interface import classImplements
&gt;&gt;&gt; classImplements(Host, IHost)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Marker interfaces ==

An interface can be used to declare that a particular object belongs to a special type. An interface without any attribute or method is called marker interface.

Here is a marker interface:

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from zope.interface import Interface

&gt;&gt;&gt; class ISpecialGuest(Interface):
...     &quot;&quot;&quot;A special guest&quot;&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This interface can be used to declare an object is a special guest.

'''Stollen''', is a rich, fruit bread dusted with icing sugar, which is traditionally made at Christmas.

== Ingredients ==

* 2oz/50g seedless [[cookbook: raisin|raisins]]
* 2oz/50g [[cookbook: currant|currants]]
* 2oz/50g candied [[cookbook: citrus|citrus peel]]
* 2oz/50g halved [[cookbook: cherry|maraschino cherries]]
* 4 tablespoons  dark [[cookbook:rum| rum]] or brandy
* ¾ oz/20g [[cookbook: yeast|yeast]]
* 3oz/75g [[cookbook: sugar|sugar]]
* 1½ tablespoons warm water
* 1 lb/450g [[cookbook: flour|plain flour]] (or all-purpose flour)
* 1½oz/40g chopped [[cookbook: almond|almonds]]
* 5 fl oz/150ml [[cookbook: milk|milk]]
* grated rind ½ [[cookbook: lemon|lemon]]
* ¼ teaspoon [[cookbook: salt|salt]]
* 1 egg, well beaten
* 5oz/150g [[cookbook: butter|butter]], 3oz/100g diced and softened, 2oz/50g melted
* ½oz/15g [[cookbook: icing sugar|icing sugar]]

== Procedure ==

# Put the raisins, currents, citrus peel and cherries in a bowl with the rum/brandy and leave them to soak for at least one hour.
# In a small bowl, stir the yeast and one teaspoon of the sugar into the water. Leave this for five minutes for fresh yeast and fifteen minutes for dried yeast.
# Sprinkle 1½ tablespoons of the flour into the fruit together with the almonds. Stir the mixture until the flour is completely absorbed.
# Warm the milk until it is lukewarm and stir in the remaining sugar until it has dissolved. Then, stir in the lemon rind.
# Place all but 2 oz/50g of the flour in a large bowl with the salt. Pour in the yeast mixture and mix thoroughly.
# Add the egg and the milk and sugar mixture to the flour and then beat in the softened butter.
# Mix everything into a [[cookbook:Pastry Dough|dough]], turn it onto a floured work surface and knead it, using the rest of the flour, until it is no longer sticky.
# Gradually add the fruit and almonds whilst continuing to knead the dough. 
# Clean the large bowl and brush the inside with one tablespoon of the melted butter.
# Brush the top of the dough with another two tablespoons of the melted butter and place it in the bowl.
# Cover the dough with a clean cloth and leave it for two hours, or until it has doubled in size.
# Punch down the dough and leave it to rest for ten minutes.
# Roll the dough into a rectangle 12 x 8 ins (30 x 20 cms) and brush it with the remaining melted butter.
# Fold two opposite sides of the rectangle towards the middle, overlapping them slightly. Press the joint gently to keep it in place.
# Taper the ends of the loaf slightly and push the sides gently together to form a mound in the middle. The loaf should be about 3½ ins (9cm) wide and 14 ins (35cm) long.
# Place the loaf on a floured baking sheet and brush it with any remaining melted butter. Leave it in a warm place for an hour or until it has doubled in size.
# Pre-heat the oven to 375°F/190°C.
# Bake the Stollen for 45 minutes or until it is brown and crusty.
# Allow the Stollen to cool and then sift the icing sugar over the top.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What does it look like?==
[[Image:Olive baboon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Olive baboon]]
All baboons have long dog-like muzzles (cynocephalus, &quot;dog-head&quot;), close-set eyes, heavy powerful jaws, thick fur except on their muzzle, and a short tail and rough spots on their extended hindquarters, called ischial callosities. These callouses are nerveless, hairless pads of skin which are present to provide sitting comfort for the baboon (and other Old World monkeys). Males of the Hamadryas Baboon species also have a large white mane.

There is considerable differences in size and weight depending on species, the Guinea Baboon is 50 cm (20 inches) and weighs only 14 kg (30 lb) while the biggest Chacma Baboon can be 120 cm (47 inches) and weigh 40 kg (90 lb). 

==What does it eat?==
Their diet is omnivorous, both meat and vegetation, but mostly vegetarian; yet they eat insects and occasionally prey on fish, shellfish, hares, birds, vervet monkeys, and small antelopes. They are foragers and are active at irregular times throughout the day and night. They can raid human dwellings and in South Africa they have been known to prey on sheep and goats.
[[Image:Baboons on rock.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Baby baboon with mother.]]
==Where can it be found?==
Baboons are terrestrial (ground dwelling) and are found in open savannah, open woodland and hills across Africa. Most baboons live in hierarchical troops. Group sizes vary between 5 to 250 animals (often about 50 or so), depending on specific circumstances, especially species and time of year.

==How does it defend itself?==
Their main predators are man and the leopard, although they are tough prey for a leopard and large males will often confront them by flashing their eyelids, showing their teeth by yawning, making gestures, and chasing after the intruder/predator.

Baboons in captivity have been known to live up to 45 years, while in the wild their life expectancy is about 30 years.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The series representation of Euler's number ''e''

: &lt;math&gt;e = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\!&lt;/math&gt;
can be used to prove that ''e'' is irrational. Of the many representations of e, this is the Taylor series for the exponential function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; evaluated at ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

==Summary of the proof==
This is a proof by contradiction.  Initially ''e'' is assumed to be a rational number of the form ''a''/''b''.  We then analyze a blown-up difference ''x'' of the series representing ''e'' and its strictly smaller ''b''th partial sum, which approximates the limiting value ''e''.  By choosing the magnifying factor to be ''b''!, the fraction ''a''/''b'' and the ''b''th partial sum are turned into integers, hence ''x'' must be a positive integer. However, the fast convergence of the series representation implies that the magnified approximation error  ''x'' is still strictly smaller than 1. From this contradiction we deduce that ''e'' is irrational.

==Proof==
Suppose that ''e'' is a rational number. Then there exist positive integers ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''e'' = ''a''/''b''.

Define the number

:&lt;math&gt;\ x = b!\,\biggl(e - \sum_{n = 0}^{b} \frac{1}{n!}\biggr)\!&lt;/math&gt;

To see that ''x'' is an integer, substitute ''e'' = ''a''/''b'' into this definition to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;
x = b!\,\biggl(\frac{a}{b} - \sum_{n = 0}^{b} \frac{1}{n!}\biggr)
= a(b - 1)! - \sum_{n = 0}^{b} \frac{b!}{n!}\,.
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is an integer, and every fraction in the sum is an integer since ''n''≤''b'' for each term. Therefore ''x'' is an integer.

We now prove that 0 &lt; ''x'' &lt; 1. First, insert the above series representation of ''e'' into the definition of ''x'' to obtain

:&lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{n = b+1}^{\infty} \frac{b!}{n!}&gt;0\,.\!&lt;/math&gt;

For all terms with ''n'' ≥ ''b'' + 1 we have the upper estimate
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{b!}{n!}
=\frac1{(b+1)(b+2)\cdots(b+(n-b))}
\le\frac1{(b+1)^{n-b}}\,,\!
&lt;/math&gt;
which is even strict for every ''n'' ≥ ''b'' + 2. Changing the index of summation to ''k'' = ''n'' – ''b'' and using the formula for the infinite geometric series, we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;
x 
=\sum_{n = b+1}^{\infty} \frac{b!}{n!}
&lt; \sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac1{(b+1)^k}
=\frac{1}{b+1}\biggl(\frac1{1-\frac1{b+1}}\biggr)
= \frac{1}{b}
\le 1.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is no integer strictly between 0 and 1, we have reached a contradiction, and so ''e'' must be irrational.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Preparing the Weapon=
*Download the references here: http://sharebee.com/2f11d7c1
*In order to learn how to apply textures, move all of the bmp files/textures to a different folder. (optional)
*Leaving the textures as is will import them into XSI Mod Tool without having to move them to the XSI pictures folder. (mentioned earlier)

==Importing the Weapon==
# Open XSI Mod Tool 6.
# Go to ValveSource&gt;Import SMD
# Find lr300.smd and select it.
# Check the ''Import Materials'' checkbox.
# Click OK to import.
# To see the model in its textured state, change the (upper right) viewport text that reads &quot;Wireframe&quot; to &quot;Textured Decal&quot;.
# Change the upper right viewport text that reads &quot;Camera&quot; to &quot;User&quot;. This will clear the blank space that shows to the left and right of the camera viewport.

==Applying the Textures (optional)==
Changing the shader mode from wireframe to textured decal will show various bright colors.
*Change any one of the viewports modes to &quot;Texture Editor&quot;. The default modes are ''Top'', ''Front'', ''Right'', and ''Camera''.
*Click the weapon model in any one of the other viewports.

If you cannot click the model, change the selection filter to object. (Go to the upper right corner of the screen and select the word ''Object''.
*In the texture editor viewport, select clips at the top and expand all clips. You will see a list of all the textures the model uses. For now ''crappyrec'' should be checked.
*To import crappyrec.bmp, go to File&gt;Clip Properties (in the texture editor window.)
*Look around for some red text. You might have to scroll down to see it.
*Once you find it, click the ''Usr'' button. This tells XSI Mod Tool that you are defining the location of the texture.
*Click the ''...'' button and select crappyrec.bmp.
*Repeat this for every texture.
*To change texture groups, go to Clips&gt;All Clips and select the texture group to which you want to apply a texture. (Note: Do not texture noIcon_pic).

==Scaling the Model==
* Delete the light source by clicking the Scene button. It is located on the right hand panel on the screen, a little bit above the transform panel.
* Click what appears to be the light source and press the DELETE key.
* Go to File&gt;Crosswalk&gt;Export.
* Export the scene .XSI 6.0 (text) to the same folder where you placed lr300.smd
* Open the hands file downloaded earlier.
* Go to File&gt;Import&gt;dotXSI
* Uncheck everything except materials.
* Press OK and select your file to import it.
* Now you may notice in comparison with the hands, the LR300 is huge. Now is the time to scale it down.
* Click the LR-300. Its edges should become highlighted in white and cyan.
* On the right hand panel of the screen, under transform, click the s button and click the button underneath it. This ensures the scaling is done in all axes.
* In the User viewport, click and drag to scale the model down.
{{NOTE|To maximize a viewport, click the button on the top right of it. (It looks like a square in a square.)}}
* You might need to move the model to the center of the grid. To do this press the t under the transform panel and press the button underneath it. Use the red, green, and blue arrows to move the LR-300 around. It is better to use the 2D viewports for this. (Front, left, top, etc.)
* You can also use the textboxes near the s button to resize the LR-300. Set all of them to 0.0697. Note that you can scale the model however you like.
* Lastly, click the Scene button again. Navigate to Scene_Root1&gt;bullet_ho0. Press the Cut button a few times. The Cut button is in the right hand panel under the constrain panel.
* Now right click Scene_Root1 and press delete.
* Press the Scene button again and rename bullet_ho0 to LR300 or whatever you like. There are two ways to rename an object in the Scene explorer. You can double click the object and a window will pop up with the item's name. Just edit it there and press enter. The other way is to slowly double click the object in the Scene explorer. The object will turn into a textbox in the Scene explorer.
{{Important|Under the right hand panel click ''Transform'', and click ''Freeze All Transforms''. This will ensure a proper export.}}
* Save this file as '''css-lr300-rig'''.exp in a folder called '''css-lr300'''.

==Lesson 9==

Welcome to Lesson 9.  Here you will be taught the final components of Shahmukhi.

==Extra Symbols==

hamzah - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ء &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

tashdīd - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ّ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

nūn-ē ġunnah - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ں &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

=====hamzah - ء=====

Hamzah is used when there are two vowels next to each other without a consonant in between them in a word.  The hamzah is placed above the first vowel.  If the first vowel is short (which means that it won't be marked at all) hamzah is very useful.  

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ویٔانا &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - vīānā - Vienna

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; میں گٔے &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - mai~ gaē - I have gone

In the second example, the first vowel is short and is not marked.  Therefore, if it not for the hamzah, it would read &quot;mai~ gē&quot; (which wouldn't make any sense) instead of &quot;mai~ gaē&quot;.

=====tashdīd - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ّ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;=====

Tashdīd is used when there are doubled consonants without a vowel in between them (except in some verb infinitives where the consonants are written separately).  It is placed above the consonant to double it.  

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ججّ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - jajj - judge

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ٹرکّ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - ṭrukk - truck

=====nūn-e ġunnah - ں=====

Nūn-e ġunnah is a modified form of nūn that is used only at the end of words to indicate nasalization (which is romanized as ~).  But if there is nasalization in the middle of a word, then it is indicated by a nūn (or a mīm if it is an &quot;m&quot; sound) anyway.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; میں &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - mai~ - I

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; سکنٹ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - saki~ṭ - second

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; اولمپک &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; - ōli~pik - Olympic

==Punctuation==

In Shahmukhi, punctuation is a little different than that of English.  Here are the different ones:

full stop (.) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ۔ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

comma (,) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ، &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

semicolon (;) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ؛ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

question mark (?) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ؟ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

percent sign (%) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ٪ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

asterisk (*) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ٭ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

date separator (/) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ؍ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

decimal separator (.) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ٫ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

thousands separator (,) - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ٬ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Numerals==

These are Shahmukhi numerals.  Keep in mind that although Shahmukhi Punjabi is written from right to left, numbers are written from left to right, just like in English.  

&lt;big&gt;0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;۰     ۱     ۲     ۳     ۴     ۵     ۶     ۷     ۸     ۹&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Examples:

twenty five - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;۲۵&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

seven hundred and thirty eight - &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;۷۳۸&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Explanation of Multiple Letters==

In Shahmukhi, you have seen multiple letters for t, s, h, and z.  This is because of loan words from Persian and Arabic.  

Zāl -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ذ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, zōē -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ظ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, zuāt -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ض &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, tōē -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ط &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, sē -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ث &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, suād -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ص &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, and baṛī hē -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ح &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; are used to write words of Arabic/Persian origin.  In Arabic and Persian, these letters were pronounced differently, but when they were assimilated into Punjabi, the original sounds were also assimilated and were transformed to be more Indic.  This accounts for the multiple letters for one sound.  

Tē -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ت &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, sīn -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; س &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, chhōṭī hē -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ہ &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, and zē -&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; ز &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; are used to write words of Indic origin.  

==Summary==

Congratulations!  You have completed your final instructive Shahmukhi lesson.  The final two lessons are reading exercises designed to help you further understand Shahmukhi.  Proceed when you are ready.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consider a curve C of class of at least 2 with the arc length parametrization f(s). The unit tangent vector is f'(s). Since f'(s)·f'(s)=1, we can differentiate this to obtain f'(s)·f''(s)=0.

Therefore, if f''(s) is not the zero vector, then it is a vector that is orthogonal to the unit tangent vector. The line passing through this vector and f(s) is the '''principal normal line'' of this curve at the point f(s). It is clear that this normal line is within the osculating plane because it is spanned by f''(s). The unit vector within this line,

&lt;math&gt;p(s)=\frac{f''(s)}{|f''(s)|}&lt;/math&gt;,

is the '''unit principal normal vector''' of the curve C at the point f(s).

It is important to note that when you change the direction of the parametrization of the curve, the unit tangent vector also changes directions, but the principal normal unit vector does not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consider a curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of class of at least 2, parametrized by the arc length parameter, &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

The magnitude of &lt;math&gt;f''(s)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''curvature''' of the curve &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplicative inverse of the curvature is called the '''radius of curvature.'''

The curvature is 0 at every point if and only if the curve is a straight line. Suppose that the curvature is always 0. Then &lt;math&gt;f''(s)&lt;/math&gt; is always 0, which proves that it is a straight line through elementary integrations.

We can also consider the normal vector &lt;math&gt;f''(s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the curvature vector.

The point that is away from &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt; by a distance of the radius of curvature in the direction of the principal normal unit vector is called the '''center of curvature''' of the point &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt; and the circle with the center on the center of curvature and with the radius as the radius of curvature is called the '''osculating circle''' at the point &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt;. It is very obvious that the unit tangent vector at the point &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt; is tangent to the osculating circle at &lt;math&gt;f(s)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">*Open css-lr300-rig.exp

==Setting up the Scene==
*Open up the Scene Explorer by pressing the ''Scene'' button on the right.
*Click the light source and press ''DELETE''.
Explanation: This lets the game perform the lighting for you when you export the models.

==Fixing the Hierarchy==
*Press '''9''' to bring up the schematic view of the scene.
*Select the null called ''ValveBiped''.
*Click the ''Parent'' button on the right hand panel under ''Constrain''.
*Click the two black rectangles.
*Select the null called ''ValveBiped.ValveBiped''.
*Click the ''Parent'' button on the right hand panel under ''Constrain''.
*Click the ''Frame'' null.
*Now right click and press '''Ctrl+R'''.
{{NOTE|Each animation can have a different hierarchy but NOT a different rig.}}

==Exporting==
*Change the selection filter to null. On the right hand panel under Select, click the button that looks like a circle with a triangle inside it. Click ''null''.
*Press '''Ctrl+A''' to select all objects.
*On the right hand panel click ''Transform'', and then click ''Set Neutral Pose''.
*Change the selection filter back to object.
{{NOTE|You can only export one model at a time.}}
*First, find a folder to which you will export your models and animations. You should already have this folder if you read [[Animating Weapons for Counter-Strike Source/Setting up the Work Folders|Setting up the Work Folders]]. Use the ''tocompile'' folder.
*Save the scene now.
*Select the LR-300 and delete it by pressing delete.
*On the top menu, click ValveSource&gt;Export SMD.
*Make sure the drop down list has &quot;Model(.SMD)&quot; selected.
*Check only the first box.
*Export it as hands.smd or something meaningful.
*Reopen the scene without saving it.
*Repeat the exporting process for the LR-300.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consider a curve C of class of at least 2 with the arc length parametrization f(s).

The '''unit binormal vector''' is the cross product of the unit tangent vector and the unit principal normal vector,

&lt;math&gt;b(s)=t(s)\times p(s)&lt;/math&gt;

which has a magnitude of 1 because t(s) and p(s) are orthogonal, and which are orthogonal to both t(s) and p(s).

The line passing through f(s) in the direction of b(s) is called the '''binormal line''', and the plane spanned by the b(s) and t(s) is called the '''rectifying plane.'''

Now we have equations of the three planes. The normal plane is given by the equation &lt;math&gt;(x_1-f(s))\cdot t(s)=0&lt;/math&gt;, the rectifying plane is given by the equation &lt;math&gt;(x_1-f(s))\cdot p(s)=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the osculating plane is given by the equation &lt;math&gt;(x_1-f(s))\cdot b(s)=0&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that the earlier formula for the osculating plane is the same as this formula.

== Overview ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Throughout the series, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] experiences dreams which, as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] says, are no ordinary dreams. In most cases, these turn out to be inadvertent leakage from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Voldemort]]'s mind to Harry's. In some cases, they serve to mislead Harry; in other cases, they give Harry vital information about Voldemort's plans.

Harry's visions of what is happening in Voldemort's mind are always accompanied by pain in the lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The reverse is not always true; pain in Harry's scar can be triggered by Voldemort's proximity as well as the power of his thoughts and emotions. At least in the beginning, Harry is only able to sense strong emotions from Voldemort; but eventually, he becomes able to see what Voldemort is seeing and thinking.

== Event Details ==

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

Harry's scar pains him a number of times in this book, because by the time Harry arrives at Hogwarts, Voldemort is riding the back of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Quirrell|Professor Quirrell]]'s head, under his turban. The only time, possibly, that Harry is able to perceive Voldemort's thoughts, is in an odd dream that Harry has on the first night he is at school. During the night, Harry has a dream, involving Quirrell's turban and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Malfoy]] turning into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], and Snape telling him that he must transfer to Slytherin house.

Harry is required to serve a detention in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]], trailing a wounded [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|unicorn]]. When Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] reach the unicorn, a hooded and cloaked figure is bent over it. Harry's scar suddenly pains him, to the point that he is unable to get away; Draco runs, but [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Firenze|Firenze]], appearing out of the woods, charges the cloaked figure and saves Harry.

During exams, Harry has trouble sleeping, suffering from &quot;his old nightmare&quot;, with the addition of a hooded figure dripping blood. It is never made entirely clear what the nightmare in question is, though this may refer to the dream of Quirrell's turban from the start of the school year.

In the climactic [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|encounter at the end of the book]], it appears that Voldemort is able to read Harry's thoughts. This is never confirmed, though Voldemort seems to have knowledge that cannot otherwise be explained. This may be conscious exercise of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimency]] by Voldemort, rather than the existing condition described below.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

With the death of Quirrell, and Voldemort's return to Albania, Harry's scar does not trouble him, and Voldemort does not have enough emotional strength for Harry to sense him. While Harry does end up battling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Tom Marvolo Riddle|Tom Riddle]], his scar does not pain him at the time.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

Harry again does not sense Voldemort directly, as Voldemort is a disembodied spirit wandering the forests of Albania.

While Harry hears a high, shrill laugh whenever [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]] approach, and comes to the conclusion, eventually, that what he is hearing is Voldemort murdering [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lily Potter|his mother]], these events did occur in Harry's actual presence, and may not be related to the link between him and Voldemort, being simply repressed memories being brought to the surface by the Dementors.

After learning of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius']] supposed betrayal of his parents, while trying to get to sleep, Harry hears &quot;a low, excited mutter. 'It has happened, my Lord ... the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper ...' And then came another voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head whenever the Dementors drew near...&quot; It is interesting that this scene should appear in Harry's mind, as it did not occur when Harry was around, and as he seems to have captured the essence of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Pettigrew's]] voice. There is a possibility here that this is actually a memory of Voldemort's that was retrieved through the same means by which the link was created.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

The latter half of the first chapter of this story, where the aged [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Muggle|Muggle]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Frank Bryce|Frank Bryce]], overhears a conversation between one &quot;[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]]&quot; and his &quot;master&quot;, interrupted by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nagini|a snake]] who also joins the conversation, ends with Bryce's death, at which point Harry jolts awake from the pain in his scar. From the fading details of the dream, Harry apparently perceives it from an odd viewpoint; possibly partly Voldemort's, partly the snake's. We never learn exactly how much of this scene Harry witnessed; it is certainly true that the repeated mentions of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bertha Jorkins|Bertha Jorkins]] over the next few days do not spark any recognition in him. It is possible that Harry's &quot;dream&quot; only started at the discovery of Frank Bryce, as before that time Voldemort's emotional tension may not have been high enough to cause the vision to spill over.

It is during the discussion of this dream with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] that we hear Dumbledore's theory that the scar pains Harry both when Voldemort is nearby, and when Voldemort is feeling strong emotions.

While Harry's scar does pain him a few additional times during the course of this book, Harry is unable to get more than a sense of the emotion Voldemort is feeling, until late in May. Then, Harry senses an eagle owl delivering a message to Voldemort, and sees Voldemort telling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]] that his mistake has been corrected, the man is dead. Despite this, however, Voldemort goes on to punish Pettigrew.

At the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|battle in the graveyard]], Harry's scar pains him continuously; however, this is because Voldemort is near him, and Harry does not perceive any thoughts.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

After he is discovered lying outside the living room window listening to the news, Harry thinks to himself that he has nothing to look forward to except nightmares: either the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Cemetery Duel|events in the cemetery]] the previous summer and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric]]'s death, or endless dreams of long dark hallways and locked doors, which Harry guesses are an expression of his frustration at his lack of knowledge, though for some reason they leave his scar prickling.

During the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementor]] attack in Little Whinging, Harry hears high-pitched laughter. It is uncertain whether this is a current connection, or a Dementor-inspired memory; Harry has heard high-pitched laughter, and his mother screaming, in earlier Dementor attacks.

The dreams of corridors, accompanied by prickling in his scar, continue while Harry is at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]].

Harry has a sharp pain in his scar when he is just sitting down to lunch at Grimmauld Place after his hearing at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Though it is not mentioned at the time, the timing is right for it to be the moment that Voldemort is informed by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]]'s decision to clear Harry of all charges.

Harry's scar pains him again as he is going to bed after the party celebrating Ron and Hermione being appointed [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Prefects|Prefects]]. Though it is not mentioned at the time, it is at about this time that Voldemort would have learned of the failure of his plan to use [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sturgis Podmore|Sturgis Podmore]] to recover what he wanted from the Ministry. Harry that night again dreams of long corridors and locked doors, among his other nightmares.

Harry is assigned four successive days of detention, writing lines, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]]. At the end of that time, Umbridge takes Harry's hand to see if Harry &quot;has got the message yet.&quot; When she touches Harry's hand, his scar hurts, accompanied by a strange feeling in his midriff. Discussing this later with Hermione, he wonders if there is some connection between Umbridge and Voldemort, and Hermione says that as Voldemort is now embodied again, he wouldn't need to control Umbridge as he had Quirrell. Harry wonders if Umbridge is under the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]. Hermione suggests Harry should tell Dumbledore; Harry angrily rejects this suggestion, probably in reaction to Dumbledore's having refused to speak to him since the beginning of summer. Harry suggests writing to Sirius, but Hermione rejects that, saying that communications from the school may be intercepted.

The next morning, Saturday morning, Harry writes to Sirius anyway, concealing his message, and sends it off with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]]. Sirius' head appears in the Gryffindor common room on Sunday night, and he explains to Harry that his scar hurting is likely unrelated; Umbridge is a bad enough piece of work, but Dumbledore does not feel that Umbridge is either a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eater]], or controlled by Voldemort.

Tuesday of the following week, when Harry returns from detention, Ron and Hermione propose the idea of Harry teaching [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Harry seems quite angry at the suggestion, and gets quite worked up about it, and afterwards is so tired he considers simply going to sleep in an armchair. But he eventually goes up to bed, where again he dreams of long corridors and locked doors, and wakes with his scar tingling.

In the dressing room after the first Quidditch practice with the re-formed team, Harry's scar suddenly hurts. Discussing it with Ron afterwards, he reassures Ron that this does not mean that Voldemort is near, but rather that he is having strong feelings about something. This time, Harry says, it is because Voldemort is angry: he wants something done, and it's not happening fast enough. The previous time, when Harry was in Umbridge's study, it was because he was happy; the strange feeling in his midriff was a happy feeling, and it seemed strange because he was so miserable himself at the time. The time before that, after Ron's and Hermione's party at Grimmauld Place, Voldemort had been furious. Ron says that Harry should tell Professor Dumbledore about this awareness of Voldemort's moods, but Harry refuses, saying that Dumbledore already knows. That night, Harry does fall asleep in an armchair before the Common Room fire, and dreams again about long corridors and locked doors until he is awakened by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] bringing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hedwig|Hedwig]] to him.

It is several months later before we hear of another contact. After the final meeting of what has become [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] before Christmas vacation, Harry's dream changes from a nightmare about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] to the feeling of traveling, in a long, sinuous, and muscular body, down the long hallways he had previously dreamed about. As he approaches the door that had always been locked, he sees a man, partly hidden by an [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|invisibility  cloak]]. Enraged, he strikes at the man. Waking up in his own bed, Harry is physically ill from the pain in his scar. He now recognizes that the man that he had bitten was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]]. Brought before Professor Dumbledore, Harry tells him what he had seen, and in answer to Dumbledore's question, reveals that he did not just witness the attack, he was the snake. Dumbledore sends the occupants of two of the portraits in his study, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Everard|Everard]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dilys Derwent|Dilys]], to investigate. Meanwhile, still without ever having looked at Harry, Dumbledore starts up one of his tiny, intricate machines, which emits a small plume of greenish smoke. The smoke forms the shape of a serpent in the air. Dumbledore [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 22|says]] &quot;''Naturally, naturally. But in essence divided?''&quot; The smoke stream immediately splits, forming two snakes. Dumbledore shuts the machine down, and as he puts it away, Everard returns, confirming that they had found someone &quot;down there&quot;.

Dumbledore now prepares a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Portkey|Portkey]] to take Harry and the Weasley children back to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Grimmauld Place|Grimmauld Place]]. As the Portkey activates, Dumbledore looks into Harry's eyes, and Harry's scar sears with pain again as he feels the urge rising in him to lunge at Dumbledore and sink his fangs into him.

At Grimmauld Place, he tells [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]] what had happened, and Sirius tells him not to worry about it. Harry does worry, though; afraid that he would turn into a snake and attack his friends, Harry is afraid to sleep. This fear is heightened after their first visit to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St. Mungo's Hospital]], where Harry and the Weasley children overhear Mr. and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Molly Weasley|Mrs. Weasley]] discussing what happened, with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Nymphadora Tonks|Tonks]]. Mrs. Weasley says that she thinks Dumbledore may have just been waiting for Harry to see something like this, and Moody suggests that Harry may be possessed by Voldemort.

Harry, afraid that Voldemort may be able to spy on Headquarters through his eyes, prepares to leave Grimmauld Place, but is stopped by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], who, from his portrait, passes a message from Dumbledore telling Harry to stay there. Harry figures that if he is under orders to stay there, it must be at least all right for him to sleep, so he does, again dreams of the long corridor and the door that won't open, and is awakened by the prickling in his scar and Ron announcing dinner. Harry, still not entirely convinced that he isn't possessed, stays away from the others until Hermione drags him down to talk with the others. Ginny reminds him that she actually has been possessed by Voldemort and can tell Harry how it feels. Harry apologizes for having forgotten that, and then is reassured when Ginny's recollections do not match what has been happening to him.

Shortly before school starts after the Christmas break, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] arrives and says that Professor Dumbledore wishes Harry to learn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Occlumency|Occlumency]], the magical defence of the mind against external penetration. Harry is uncertain why he needs this, as he has determined that he is not being possessed by Voldemort, but Snape refuses to explain further.

Hermione later says that probably Dumbledore wants Harry to stop having these dreams about Voldemort.

When Harry attends his first Occlumency class with Snape, he notes Snape extracting memories from his own head and placing them in what he believes to be Dumbledore's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Pensieve|Pensieve]]. Snape explains that Occlumency is the art of closing the mind against a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimency|Legilimens]], one who can read and, sometimes, interpret what is happening inside another's mind. Though Snape says this is not mind-reading, Harry thinks it sounds a lot like it to him. Snape goes on to say that Dumbledore believes that, as a result of the curse that failed to kill Harry, there is some deeper link than usual between Harry and Voldemort, and as a result, Harry is able, when he is sufficiently relaxed, to see what is happening in Voldemort's mind. Dumbledore, he says, would like that to stop. Harry says that it has been really useful, as it saved Mr. Weasley from the snake, and Snape says that up until then, Voldemort had been unaware that the connection existed, but now that he is aware of it, he has guessed that it might go both ways, and he might use it to try to get Harry to do things.

At this point, the lesson begins, and Harry is totally unable to stop Snape from wandering through his memories. One of the memories Snape finds is the memory of Mr. Weasley taking Harry to the hearing at the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. Harry suddenly realizes that the long hallway he keeps dreaming of is the hallway past the courtrooms in the Ministry of Magic. He remembers that corridor leads to the Department of Mysteries, and recognizes that Mr. Weasley was outside the door of the Department on the night the snake attacked. Harry asks Snape about the Department of Mysteries, and says that he has been dreaming about that corridor for months. As he says this, his scar starts hurting. Snape dismisses him, saying he should come back on Wednesday. As Hary leaves, he notes Snape taking memories out of the Pensieve and replacing them in his own head.

Discussing this with Ron and Hermione in the library later, Harry suggests that the thing Voldemort is looking for is probably in the Department of Mysteries. Hermione notes that almost certainly, Sturgis Podmore would have been guarding that door the night he was arrested, but cannot offer any explanation as to why Voldemort would have been trying to get through the door.

Harry, exhausted, now goes to bed, but as he steps through the door to the dorm, he is felled by the worst pain yet in his head, and hears the sound of maniacal laughter. Ron, who has followed at Hermione's request, asks what's going on, and Harry says that Voldemort is happy, really really happy; something he's been waiting for has happened. Ron says that Harry's resistance will be a bit low given what he's been through that evening. Harry, with his scar prickling, thinks that these lessons may be hurting rather than helping.

The next day, the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|''Daily Prophet'']] carries news of what had made Voldemort so happy: there has been a mass breakout from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], and ten prisoners, including [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Antonin Dolohov|Antonin Dolohov]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Augustus Rookwood|Augustus Rookwood]], have escaped.

Over the next while, despite his practicing, Harry's Occlumency skills seem to decrease. Additionally, his scar, which used to prickle only after one of the bursts of emotion that he had sensed before, now seems to be mildly painful all the time, and he has odd little bursts of elation or rage that have nothing to do with what Harry is doing. Additionally, his dreams of walking down the corridor to the Department of Mysteries seem to be occurring every night, and always end with him standing longingly in front of the plain black door. Hermione suggests that it is like an illness, that has to reach a peak before it can start to get better; Ron, on the other hand, seems to think that Snape may actually be making Harry's natural defences worse, to make things easier for Voldemort. Hermione says that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and so Ron should do likewise.

In late February, following the miserable Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, Harry dreams again of the corridor and the dark door at the end of the hallway. When he reaches the door, this time it is just slightly ajar. He reaches out to push it open, but is awakened by a rasping snore from Ron.

The following Monday, after publication of Harry's interview with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rita Skeeter|Rita Skeeter]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Quibbler|the ''Quibbler'']], Harry has to leave the party in his honour because his scar is prickling. When he goes to sleep, he is immediately in a dark, curtained room facing a kneeling man. The man, addressed as Rookwood, has apparently just told him that the plan he has been following will not work. Rookwood, who seems to be afraid despite being told that he is not to blame, says that he is sure of his facts, as he used to work in the Department. Reminded that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Avery|Avery]] had said [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Broderick Bode|Bode]] would be able to remove it, Rookwood says that Bode would have known what would happen, and likely that's why he had fought so hard against [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Malfoy]]'s [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Imperio|Imperius curse]]. Rookwood is dismissed, with instructions to send Avery, and in his dream Harry turns to a mirror, to find Lord Voldemort looking back at him. Panicked, he awakens screaming. Ron, who has just come up and is getting ready for bed, tries to help him; Harry explains what had just happened, and that Avery was in trouble. His explanation is cut short by the arrival of Dean and Seamus, who are also getting ready for bed. Under cover of their preparations, Ron tells Harry that he has to tell Dumbledore; Harry says that they have him learning Occlumency so he won't be able to see things like this, and so clearly don't want to know about it.

Snape, however, sees this dream in Harry's memories in an Occlumency lesson, and asks Harry about it. Harry says it is a dream he has had, and that this is the only one. Snape suggests that Harry's not having made any progress is due to his liking the feeling of being special, of knowing what Voldemort is doing. Harry retorts that reporting what Voldemort is doing is Snape's job, and Snape, after a short pause, confirms it. Later in the same lesson, Harry again experiences the long hallway, but this time the door is open when he reaches it, and he finds himself in a circular room lit by blue-flamed candles and having multiple doors. Before he can choose which door to go through, Snape breaks him out of his waking dream. The lesson is then interrupted by the confusion surrounding Umbridge's sacking of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]].

In April, the betrayal of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] results in the attempted arrest of Professor Dumbledore by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], Umbridge, and the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dawlish|Dawlish]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Kingsley Shacklebolt|Shacklebolt]]. With his attackers disabled, Dumbledore tells Harry urgently that he must continue his studies of Occlumency with Snape. As Dumbledore speaks directly to him, Harry once again feels a pain in his scar and is filled with the urge to strike at Dumbledore and sink his fangs into him.

The following day, Harry again dreams of the long corridor, and finds the door to the Department of Mysteries open at the end of it. In the circular room, he opens another door and finds a room filled with odd flecks of light and a mechanical clicking noise. He does not take time to investigate but goes straight through to another door, which leads into a vast, dimly lit room full of shelves, each shelf laden with dusty, spun-glass spheres. His scar hurts, but there is something in here that he very much wants... and an escaped firework explodes, waking him up.

Harry dreads his next Occlumency class, as Snape is sure to find out how much further into the Department of Mysteries his dreams have taken him, but at the last moment [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco Malfoy]] interrupts, saying that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Montague|Montague]] has turned up inside a toilet and Professor Umbridge needs Snape's help to extract him. Harry's curiosity about the thoughts Snape has been storing in the Pensieve gets the better of him. Snape, discovering him viewing these memories, orders Harry out of his office, effectively ending the Occlumency lessons. Harry has to tell Hermione that he is no longer having the funny dreams, even though he actually is, in order to cover for the fact that he is not taking Occlumency any more.

Harry feels he must discuss what he has learned from Snape's memories about his father with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius]], who had been his father's friend. When Hermione asks him later, Harry feels he cannot discuss what he had talked about, so instead says that he was telling Sirius about Snape's decision to end the Occlumency lessons. Hermione agrees with Sirius that Harry should return, and says that she knows Harry is still having those dreams. Harry is, in fact, though he denies it; this time, he had gotten all the way to row number 97, which is apparently where whatever it is that Voldemort wants is kept.

Exhausted after watching Umbridge, with the assistance of five [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]], sack [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] just after midnight, and having spent hours discussing it with the other members of Gryffindor house, Harry falls asleep shortly after starting his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/History of Magic|History of Magic]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/OWL exams|OWL exam]]. He again dreams of the long hallway, the open door, the circular room, and the room full of spun-glass spheres, but this time, when he reaches the end of row 97, he sees Voldemort there, and a huddled figure on the floor. Harry recognizes the huddled figure as Sirius, and sees that Voldemort is torturing him to get him the thing he has been seeking. Harry awakens with an agonizing pain in his scar, and is helped out of the exam room by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Professor Tofty|Professor Tofty, the examiner]]. When Harry refuses to go to the Hospital Wing, Professor Tofty suggests that after a little rest he could try finishing up his exam, but Harry says that he has done about as much as he is able to.

Over the next while, as Harry arranges for a distraction, breaks into Umbridge's office, is caught, helps Hermione lead Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest to be captured by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Centaur|Centaurs]], flies to London with the other students on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Thestral|Thestrals]], and enters the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic, Harry's scar will continue to pain him. Harry will take this as a sign that Voldemort is still torturing Sirius. Harry dreads the moment when that pain reaches a peak, because he believes that will be when Voldemort, either having gotten what he wants, or having decided that Sirius will not give in, will kill Sirius.

As the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle at the Department of Mysteries|Battle in the Ministry]] ends, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] escapes; Harry follows, to duel with her in the Atrium. Bellatrix demands that Harry release the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|Prophecy]]. Harry tells her that it is gone, and feels his scar flare with pain. He tells Bellatrix that Voldemort knows it is gone as well. The pain in his scar increases until Harry is almost insensible from it, as Voldemort himself arrives in the Atrium. Through the continuing pain, Harry watches Voldemort duel with Dumbledore. Eventually, Voldemort retreats. Harry, who has been kept out of the battle by an animated statue out of the Fountain of Magical Brethren, believes that the battle is over, but then his scar almost explodes with pain as Voldemort possesses him and challenges Dumbledore to kill Voldemort by killing Harry. Harry, who has just seen his godfather Sirius die, thinks of how he will be re-united in death with Sirius and his parents. Suddenly and inexplicably, Voldemort is forced to leave his mind.

In Dumbledore's office after the battle, Dumbledore explains to Harry that he had recognized the existence of the link in previous years, and had believed that it was getting stronger since Voldemort's return. He tells Harry that the reason he had Snape teaching Harry Occlumency, rather than doing it himself, was that he believed that if Voldemort suspected there was more to the relationship between Harry and Dumbledore than that of student to Headmaster, Voldemort would use that knowledge to attack either or both of them. This is also the reason that Dumbledore had been so careful to avoid looking at Harry, or speaking directly to him, for the entire year. Dumbledore also says that it is love, in particular the love of Sirius, that had driven Voldemort out of Harry's mind in the Atrium, and it is that strength that Harry has and Voldemort does not, that will in the end allow Harry to defeat Voldemort.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

Professor Dumbledore asks Harry at one point if his scar has been hurting at all. Harry says it has not, and expresses surprise. Dumbledore says he is not surprised at all; after the events at the Ministry, he believes Voldemort has determined that Harry's mind is a very uncomfortable place to be, and will choose to avoid it as much as he can.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

Despite Voldemort being present in the sky above Privet Lane, Harry's scar does not start paining him until Voldemort, alerted to the identity of the real Harry, appears immediately behind him and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] on the flying motorbike. It is only through the nearly blinding pain in his scar that he duels with Voldemort and the two other Death Eaters there. The pain in Harry's scar continues even after Harry has passed through the protective spells around [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ted Tonks|Ted Tonks']] house, and to a lesser extent as Harry reaches [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/The Burrow|The Burrow]] and waits for the other teams to return. The pain in his scar then reaches a crescendo, and, as he leaves the house for some fresh air, he sees, through Voldemort's eyes, an old man being tortured. Voldemort accuses the man, who Harry recognizes as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]], of lying to him about another wand working against Harry, and Ollivander saying that the linkage exists only between Voldemort's wand and Harry's. As the vision and the pain fade, Harry sees that Ron and Hermione are at his side, and tells them what he has seen. Hermione is horrified; she is worried that Voldemort might use this channel against Harry again.

On the night before Harry turns 17, he dreams of seeing a small village, which may hold the man he seeks, at the end of a mountain road. Ron tells him that he was saying &quot;Gregorovitch&quot; in his sleep, over and over, and Harry says he thinks Voldemort is looking for him. Neither of them can remember who Gregorovitch is, though Ron suggests he might be a Quidditch player.

It is two days later, in conversation with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Viktor Krum|Viktor Krum]] that Harry recalls that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]] is a wand-maker. Viktor says that he is the best, though he knows the English wizards set great store by Ollivander. Harry, understanding that Voldemort fears his wand and is trying to find a different wand that will defeat Harry's, wonders whether Gregorovitch might be able to build the stronger wand that Voldemort so clearly wants.

Shortly after the Trio evade the Death Eaters and return to Grimmauld Place, Harry's scar pains him again. Ron asks him what's wrong, and Harry says &quot;he's very angry&quot;. Hermione, dismayed, says that she had thought that had stopped, and Harry says it has started again, mostly when Voldemort loses control. Hermione reminds Harry that Voldemort had used that channel to plant false memories in Harry before, and Harry says he remembers that very well without reminders. As the pain increases, Harry flees to the bathroom, and there, through Voldemort's eyes, he sees Draco Malfoy being compelled to torture one of the two Death Eaters for having allowed Harry to escape from the Tottenham Court Road café.

Harry's scar is quiet until a month later, when it suddenly flares up at dinnertime, possibly coincidentally just after Harry says Voldemort's name. Harry, again, goes to the bathroom, where he sees through Voldemort's eyes as he enters a  village, asks the German-speaking occupants of a house there for Gregorovitch, and then murders them when they say they don't know where he moved to. Ron and Hermione hear him cry out; when Harry tells them what he has seen, Hermione again tells him that Dumbledore had wanted him to stop seeing these things. Harry retorts that he doesn't like it, but he was never any good at Occlumency, and he's going to keep on doing it because, despite his having to see what Voldemort is doing when he's at his worst, it is useful to know what Voldemort is up to.

That night, Harry wonders how long Gregorovitch can stay hidden with Voldemort seeking him so assiduously.

As it turns out, it is the following night that Harry, standing guard in the tent after their escape from the Ministry, sees through Voldemort's eyes as Voldemort interrogates Gregorovitch, examines his memory to see a thief taking something, and murders him. Hermione again says that Harry should not be seeing Voldemort's thoughts, though at Ron's bidding she does not say Voldemort's name. When Harry tries to tell her what Voldemort was doing, she dismisses him. Talking it over quietly with Ron, Harry wonders what Voldemort is after; it can't be a new wand, not if he's killing wandmakers, and Harry didn't see what the thief had stolen, so it must have been something small.

Harry finds that when he is wearing the locket [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcrux|Horcrux]], his scar prickles more frequently. Sometimes, when it prickles most fiercely, he sees a face: always the same face, that of the young thief who had stolen the object from Gregorovitch. This disappoints Ron, who is hoping Harry's linkage with Voldemort will provide some news of his family.

When Harry and Hermione visit [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bathilda Bagshot|Bathilda Bagshot]] in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Godric's Hollow|Godric's Hollow]], Harry notes the Horcrux he is wearing seems to move as he passes close to Bathilda. However, it is only when the concealed Nagini contacts Voldemort that Harry's scar prickles, and he hears Voldemort, exultant, saying &quot;Hold him!&quot; Not understanding what has happened, Harry turns to look where Bathilda has indicated, in hopes of finding the Sword of Gryffindor, but out of the corner of his eye sees Bathilda collapsing and Nagini emerging from her body. In the ensuing battle with Nagini, Harry is hindered by sensing Voldemort's thoughts as he flies to Godric's Hollow, and by the locket Horcrux reacting to the approach of Voldemort, the soul from which it was sheared. Harry watches through Voldemort's eyes as he and Hermione [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Apparition|Apparate]] away.

Harry now relives, in Voldemort's memory, the events of sixteen years earlier, when Harry's parents had been murdered. He watches as Voldemort murders his unarmed father, his mother, and tries to murder little Harry. Still watching through Voldemort's eyes, he sees Voldemort, back in the present, finding the photo of the thief, which Harry had found in Bathilda's study and had dropped in the struggle, and he feels Voldemort's joy as he recognizes the thief in the picture. Harry returns to himself at Hermione's urging. Hermione tells him he has been insensible for hours, not unconscious, but thrashing around and saying things.

Harry's scar does not bother him again until after Ron rejoins the group, and the locket Horcrux is destroyed. When Harry's scar starts prickling again, Harry is somewhat dismayed that the visions he receives are no longer as detailed as they had been, being instead vague impressions of mountain shapes, and blames his broken wand for the loss of clarity.

However, shortly after Harry, Hermione, and Ron are captured by Snatchers, Harry's scar once more burns with pain, and Harry finds himself looking through Voldemort's eyes at a huge stone building with a tall tower. He must make the supreme effort to remain in his own mind as Voldemort flies to the top of the tower, insinuates himself within the cell at the top, and questions the man imprisoned there. The man says he knows what Voldemort has come for, but he never had it. At this point, as Harry is being dragged into [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Malfoy Manor|Malfoy Manor]], Harry finds that his fear of being identified by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] makes it easier to block out Voldemort. His continuing fear allows him to continue to block Voldemort's mental images, except for one brief interval where he sees the old man in the tower cell mocking Voldemort, until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], convinced that the sword she found the Snatchers carrying did not in fact come from her vault at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]], touches her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] to summon Voldemort. The sudden surge of pain in his scar once again opens Harry's mind to what Voldemort is thinking and doing, and again Harry must do battle, this time with Bellatrix, Lucius, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa]], and Draco, while at the same time trying to stay in his own mind as Voldemort kills the old man, who Harry now recognizes as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], then flies close enough to Apparate to Malfoy Manor.

After escaping from Malfoy Manor, Harry finds that his grief at [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]]'s death insulates him to some extent from Voldemort's thoughts. As Harry cleans up after the burial, as he speaks with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Griphook|Griphook]] about the possibility of breaking into Gringotts, as he speaks with [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ollivander|Ollivander]] about wandlore and the Elder Wand, and as he explains to Ron and Hermione what he is thinking of, his scar continues to prickle, and he has to fight the ongoing invitation to release the world he is in, to see what Voldemort is doing and thinking. Finally, beside Dobby's grave, he is once again in Voldemort's mind, and he watches as Voldemort walks the grounds of Hogwarts, as he opens Dumbledore's tomb, and as he removes the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Deathly Hallows|Elder Wand]] from Dumbledore's dead hands.

Harry's scar does not pain him again until after the escape from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Gringotts|Gringotts]]. Then, as they sit on the shores of the lake treating their injuries, and watching the dragon recuperate from its long captivity, Harry is again consumed by Voldemort's anger as he discovers that the Cup Horcrux has been stolen. Harry stays in Voldemort's mind as he summons Nagini to himself and determines to check all of the places that he has hidden Horcruxes, starting with the ring, then the locket and the one hidden at Hogwarts. The diary, Voldemort knows, has been destroyed, and he believes he did not feel its destruction because he was a disembodied spirit at the time, and the Cup has now been stolen, but surely the others have not been disturbed, he would have felt it. Harry, returning to himself as Voldemort starts his flight to the Gaunt shack, tells Ron and Hermione that they must head to Hogwarts, to try and find the final Horcrux before Voldemort gets there.

Just after Harry returns to Hogwarts, and is being brought up to speed in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], his scar burns fiercely again, and he suddenly is watching through Voldemort's eyes as Voldemort finds an empty golden box in the ruins of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Marvolo Gaunt|Gaunt]] shack. Returning to himself by force of will, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that they are running out of time. While he tries to explain to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] and the assembled members of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] in the Room of Requirement that they have a single mission at the school and then will depart, Harry's scar continues prickling and his head continues to ache. It is shortly after he is convinced to allow the group to help him search, that his scar once again burns, and he sees Voldemort launching himself into flight. He returns to himself again, telling Ron and Hermione that Voldemort is on the move.

In the Ravenclaw common room, Harry is discovered by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Alecto Carrow|Alecto Carrow]]. When she touches her [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dark Mark|Dark Mark]], Harry's scar again burns with pain, and he is once again in Voldemort's mind as Voldemort stands on a rocky outcrop surrounded by sea. Harry &quot;hears&quot; Voldemort thinking &quot;Good, they have the boy,&quot; before a loud bang brings him back to himself. He finds that the noise was [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Stupefy|Stunning]] Alecto. Harry's scar continues to throb, and he chooses to sink into Voldemort's mind while the Ravenclaw students are milling about, looking at Alecto lying on the floor. Voldemort is passing through the first cave, on his way to look at the Locket Horcrux. Harry's scar continues to throb as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] lets [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Amycus Carrow|Amycus Carrow]] into the Ravenclaw common room, as Carrow attempts to lay blame for Alecto's Stunning and the summons to Voldemort on the Ravenclaw students, and as McGonagall refuses to allow that. Shortly after Professor McGonagall is insulted, and Harry reveals himself to her, Harry sees, in the back of his mind, Voldemort sailing fast over the lake in the cavern, and then is again taken out of himself by Voldemort's rage as he finds there is no locket within the basin in the cave.

Harry's scar continues to prickle as they meet [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Snape]], as McGonagall and Snape duel, and as Snape departs the school. Shortly after Snape's flying departure, Harry is again in Voldemort's mind as the tiny boat returns to the shore of the cavern, and Voldemort leaps ashore. Harry's scar sears with pain again shortly after the assembled defenders leave the Room of Requirement, and through Voldemort's eyes he sees the closed gates of Hogwarts, and within them, the school.

As the battle is joined and Harry hunts the Diadem, he is too busy to notice his scar. However, when Hermione demands that he find Voldemort and Nagini, the last Horcrux, he notices that his scar has been aching for hours, trying to get him to see what Voldemort is doing. He is quickly able to get into Voldemort's mind. There, he sees Voldemort observing the battle, and repeatedly dismissing a broken [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy's]] attempts to end the battle, seeing them as attempts to save his son's life. Troubled about the wand in his hand, Voldemort tells Malfoy to bring Snape to him, then, looking at Nagini, says that it is the only way. Harry, returning to his own mind, reports that Voldemort is in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Shrieking Shack|the Shrieking Shack]].

As Harry, from concealment, watches Voldemort conversing with Snape in the Shrieking Shack, he feels the pain in his scar building, and knows from this that Voldemort is growing angry, though nothing in his manner reveals it. Voldemort is angry that the Elder Wand, which he has located with great effort, is working no better than the wand he got from Ollivander many years before. His rage is so extreme that it once again draws Harry out of his own mind and into Voldemort's, where he is an unwilling audience as Voldemort flips the magical cage surrounding Nagini towards Snape, and orders Nagini to kill.

In Snape's memories, Harry learns that Dumbledore had believed that the link between Harry and Voldemort was more than it seemed. Dumbledore had told Snape that when Voldemort had tried to kill Harry and had failed, a fragment of his soul had been torn off and had attached itself to Harry. It was this soul fragment that provided the communications between Harry and Voldemort, and that provided Harry's [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|ability to talk to snakes]]. While that soul fragment remains attached to Harry, it will work as a Horcrux, anchoring Voldemort's soul to Harry's. Thus, the only way for Voldemort to be defeated is for Harry to die at Voldemort's hand.

Voldemort's attempt to kill Harry in the Forbidden Forest sends Harry to a place that has been referred to as the Waystation by fans, and so will be called that in this work. There, Harry meets the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Shades|shade]] of Albus Dumbledore who explains that the soul fragment within Harry had been destroyed, and thus the link between Harry and Voldemort was broken. Dumbledore explains further, or leads Harry to the understanding that Voldemort had been unable to kill Harry because Voldemort, taking Harry's blood to re-animate himself, had also taken into himself a part of the enchantment tied to Lily Potter's blood that had protected him all those years. It is thus impossible for Harry to die while Voldemort remains alive.

In the Epilogue, Harry notes that for the past nineteen years, his scar has remained quiet.

== Notable Consequences ==

As early as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 7|Harry's first day at Hogwarts]], we understand that pain in Harry's scar is connected with an enemy of Harry, and that it seems to be related to that enemy's close study of Harry. We do not know that the enemy in question is Voldemort, however, until [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 17|the end of that book]], when Dumbledore explains that to Harry. The linkage thus is useful for informing Harry, and us, of Voldemort's proximity, and to an increasing extent over the course of the books, his emotions.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], this link has two main consequences. The first occurs around Christmas, when Harry, perceiving the attack on Arthur Weasley, is able to sound the alarm. This perception allows him to save Arthur's life. However, the burst of hatred towards Dumbledore that Harry feels as he is about to use the teapot Portkey to reach Grimmauld Place leaves him worried that Voldemort may be spying on Harry's surroundings through Harry's own eyes and ears.

As far as we are able to tell, Voldemort is not ordinarily able to look through Harry's eyes. We assume, based on what we are told in the story, and on the specific times that Harry is able to see what Voldemort is seeing, that it is only when Harry is in the grip of extraordinarily strong emotion, as he is after having witnessed the attack on Arthur Weasley, that Voldemort is able to see what Harry sees. However, having once experienced Harry's view of the world, Voldemort becomes aware of the linkage. Having learned about the link, in that same book Voldemort uses it to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries, where he was able to retrieve the Prophecy that Voldemort wanted. Harry accidentally destroyed the Prophecy, however, before it fell into Voldemort's hands. As part of that battle, and due to that same link, Harry was briefly possessed by Voldemort, who found Harry's mind an excruciatingly uncomfortable place to be, filled as it was with love (at that instant, for the departed Sirius Black).

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], this link provides necessary information about what Voldemort is doing. Voldemort seems to be less and less capable of controlling this link as the book progresses, while Harry's control over it increases. In the absence of Dumbledore, the link is our only source of information about Voldemort's actions and plans. It is through this link that Harry learns of Voldemort's intention to visit his Horcruxes, and that provides the impetus for Harry's re-entrance into Hogwarts. And Harry, by the end of this book, is able to turn the link around and force himself to see through Voldemort's eyes; it is by means of this link that Harry is able to determine that Voldemort is hiding in the Shrieking Shack.

== Analysis ==

Harry's scar hurting has always been an indication of the activity of the link between Harry and Voldemort. As the series progresses, our understanding of the behaviour of the scar, and of the link, improves alongside Harry's.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']], Harry's scar, we believe, indicates that Voldemort is close to Harry. In that book, whenever Harry's scar pains him, it is because Voldemort, then riding the back of Quirrell's head, is close to him. It is particularly intense when Voldemort is studying him.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], while Voldemort is not present, an earlier fragment of his soul is there, in the form of Tom Riddle's diary. Harry's scar does not hurt, despite the proximity of the fragment of Voldemort's soul. This could be because the fragment of soul in the diary was sheared off before Harry got his scar, and therefore the resonance which causes Harry's scar to hurt is not present; the scar could possibly only sense the soul in the state it was when the scar was created, or later. However, we will later see that Harry's scar does not react directly to other Horcruxes, even those created after the scar. It is reasonably clear that Harry's scar will only react to Voldemort, not to his soul fragments, though being in close proximity to a Horcrux, we will see later, does seem to increase his sensitivity.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], we start seeing that Harry's scar is not only reacting to proximity to Voldemort, but also to Voldemort's emotional peaks and valleys, and allowing Harry to occasionally experience what is happening in Voldemort's mind. In fact, we recognize what is happening before Harry does himself. On the two occasions that Harry experiences visions of what is happening in Voldemort's mind, he tries to dismiss it as a dream, though he is not entirely successful.

Perhaps because of this, Harry does not recognize the recurring dream he is having throughout [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] as originating with Voldemort. In this book, Harry can see entire sequences of events as they occur to Voldemort, but does not recognize that they could be entirely fictional. As a result, Voldemort is able to plant fictions into Harry's mind, and Harry, believing them to be truth, tries to act upon them, to his detriment.

Voldemort at one point tries to take over Harry's mind in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', but finds it a very uncomfortable place to be. Harry, who has just seen his godfather die, is filled with love for Sirius and a longing for death to re-unite them. Voldemort has never felt love and so the feeling is entirely alien to him. Additionally, Voldemort fears death, and so Harry's desire for it must be not only alien but frightening to him. As a result of this, Voldemort keeps his mind closed to Harry for the entire sixth book.

Throughout the latter half of ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Dumbledore has Snape attempting to teach Harry Occlumency, in an attempt to block Voldemort from Harry's mind. There is some question as to whether this will have any effect at all. First, what Voldemort is doing is impressing images onto Harry's mind, which is rather the opposite of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Legilimens|Legilimency]]; Voldemort is creating an image in his own mind, and exposing it to Harry selectively. What Harry should presumably be trained to do is to either become a better Legilimens, so that he can see the story behind the presented image, or else learn how to turn his own limited Legilimency off. Second, as Harry is not using Legilimency and is yet able to see into Voldemort's mind, there is some question as to whether Occlumency, which acts to counter Legilimency, would even work. It is possible that the link, being through the soul shard that Voldemort had left in Harry, is not actually subject to magical control.

As the channel between Harry's thoughts and Voldemort's is one of the least understood aspects of the story, at least by the protagonists, it is entirely understandable that some incorrect statements and assumptions are made about it. Most importantly, of course, is the entire issue of blocking the channel, should Harry feel the need, as discussed above. However, several minor errors have crept into the text. In particular, when Harry and Dumbledore are speaking of Harry's scar and when it hurts, Dumbledore says that he believes it hurts when Voldemort is nearby, or when he is feeling a strong emotion. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 18|Later, though]], Harry says that Dumbledore had said his scar would hurt when Voldemort was nearby or ''feeling hatred'' (italics ours). Ron urges Harry at this point to tell Dumbledore that Harry is now feeling any intense emotion of Voldemort's; Harry resists. A minor plot point thus hinges on this mistake; one must wonder whether it is Harry or the author who has misremembered.

Dumbledore informs Harry in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' that Voldemort has begun blocking Harry's access to Voldemort's mind by using Occlumency. However, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Harry is regularly experiencing Voldemort's thoughts once again. No outright explanation for this development is ever provided, although the author has provided enough information to make some inferences.

In the early chapters, Voldemort attacks Harry with a borrowed wand to avoid the reverse-spell effect generated by the twin cores of their wands. Nevertheless, Voldemort fails to kill Harry; Harry's wand reacts independently and destroys Voldemort's wand. Voldemort is furious and frightened by Harry's inexplicable power and becomes desperate to find the Elder Wand, thinking he needs a supremely powerful wand that can destroy Harry's. His emotional state could explain why Harry can once again have visions of Voldemort. It was stated by Snape in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 24|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] that Occlumency requires a calm mind. Voldemort, in turmoil after discovering that Harry has power he cannot counter or understand, is perhaps no longer capable of Occlumency. Indeed, every time Voldemort's thoughts impinge upon Harry, Voldemort is in the grip of rage and fear over his wand and his Horcruxes.

Alternative explanations exist. One of the characters does speculate that Voldemort is weakening, presumably as the endless murders further shred his soul, and this is certainly a possibility. Another, unexplored possibility is that the link to the soul shard in Harry becomes stronger as the other extant soul shards (the Horcruxes) are destroyed. There is clearly an ongoing link between the soul shard in Harry and the remains of Voldemort's soul; it is entirely possible that there is a similar link to each of Voldemort's Horcruxes. As the locket, the cup, and the diadem are destroyed, Harry's perceptions of Voldemort's actions seem less dependent on Voldemort's state of mind and more controllable by Harry's will. It is certainly possible that as these linkages are destroyed, the remaining ones become stronger. This is uncertain, however, as Voldemort is unable to perceive any of his Horcruxes being destroyed; with the diary, the ring, and the locket having been destroyed, the links to the cup, the diadem, Harry, and Nagini should have been strengthened, one would expect, to the point that Voldemort would perceive the destruction of the cup or the diadem. Yet he does not seem to notice either. Perhaps, though, the soul fragment in Harry is gaining strength through its attachment to Harry's complete and healthy soul.

It is through the course of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', then, that Voldemort's gradual loss of self-control allows Harry to once again see what Voldemort is thinking and doing when Voldemort is at his emotional extremes. Over the course of the book, Harry, who is the stronger wizard, we are told, in part because he does not fear death, learns to control how much of Voldemort's mind he allows in. By the time he is taken to Malfoy Manor, he is able, by sheer effort of will, to keep his consciousness in the face of Voldemort's fiercest anger, and he finds that his own grief, later, as he buries Dobby, allows him to hold Voldemort's thoughts to a background level, where he is aware of them to a certain extent but is not captive to them. Harry eventually reaches a point of conscious control where he can force his way into Voldemort's mind at will.

It is perhaps an interesting side light that the course of events requires that Harry's attention be drawn away from Voldemort's mind while Voldemort is inspecting Grindelwald's memory of the duel with Dumbledore. If Harry had experienced that memory, it might have changed his understanding of Dumbledore, and perhaps brought him closer to reconciliation with Dumbledore earlier in the story. While that might have been good for Harry, it would likely have weakened the story, as one of the particularly strong areas in the story is the successive unveilings of Dumbledore's motivations, first by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Aberforth Dumbledore|Aberforth]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], and second by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ghost#Waystation|shade]] of Albus Dumbledore in the Waystation.

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

One of the questions that has been asked is, when did Dumbledore become aware of the soul shard within Harry? We can never know for certain, but we can speculate.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows/Chapter 33|Snape's memories]], we learn that Dumbledore had been sure of the existence of the soul shard, since before the conversation that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] had overheard in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 19|March of the previous year]]. (The conversation in question, where Snape produces a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Expecto Patronum|Patronus]], occurs the evening after the conversation overheard by Hagrid and discussed with Harry and Hermione as they leave the Hospital Wing after Ron's birthday accident.) At that time, Dumbledore is aware that Harry's connection with Voldemort and his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Parseltongue|parseltongue ability]] are due to that shard. Note that Dumbledore never uses the word &quot;Horcrux&quot; to refer to the soul shard in that conversation; this is an argument that what is riding Harry is not a Horcrux, rather just an attached bit of soul.

So how far back can we take it? Certainly as far as [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix/Chapter 22|Christmas in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]. The telling point there is that Dumbledore asks what Harry's viewpoint was, and does not seem surprised to learn that it was through the snake's eyes that Harry witnessed the attack on Arthur. (The author has indicated, though she has not said outright, that the machine producing the snake-like coils of green smoke is indicating the dual-intelligence nature of Nagini, either Nagini and Horcrux in Nagini, or Voldemort in Voldemort and Horcrux.) This, for Dumbledore, would probably have been confirmation of two soul shards: the Horcrux in Nagini and the shard in Harry, and would have been explanation for the abilities that Harry had shown, and the communications channel.

So when did Dumbledore really know? The appearance of Voldemort's face riding the back of Quirrell's head in ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' would have told Dumbledore that Voldemort knew how to make a Horcrux, and had done so. The diary in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' indicated that Voldemort had made at least two. We suspect that it was over the summer that Dumbledore recognized that if he had made two, Voldemort likely made more, and that his soul could be frayed enough that a piece could shear off at his disembodiment. If it then attached to the last living being in the house, it would have ended up riding Harry, thus explaining, in particular, how a wizard with no direct bloodline back to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Salazar Slytherin|Slytherin]] could speak to snakes. (While Dumbledore can speak to snakes also, in his case we believe it was through study rather than an inherent ability.) We suspect that Dumbledore was reasonably sure of the existence of the soul shard through most of ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', but did not concern himself with it overly until he learned of Voldemort's re-embodiment at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 35|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']].

Related to this is, of course, Dumbledore's understanding of other aspects of this interaction. We believe that Dumbledore knew, from the beginning, that Harry would have to fight Voldemort, based on the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Prophecy|prophecy]] that was made before his birth. Probably, Dumbledore did not think, initially, that Harry had to die because of that. We suspect that, after the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], he believed that Harry would die in the encounter. When Dumbledore learns Voldemort used Harry's blood in his re-embodiment at the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', he then believed that Harry could not be killed by Voldemort. Again, it is necessary to be careful with wording; in Snape's memories in ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', we hear Dumbledore say that Harry will &quot;set out to meet his death&quot;, but he neither says that Voldemort will kill him, nor that he will die. It is Snape who says that Harry must die. Dumbledore, at this point, knows that Harry must be hit with a spell hard enough to destroy or at least detach the soul fragment, and insists that it must be done by Voldemort only because Harry is to some extent safe from Voldemort. If anyone else was to kill Harry, it would destroy the soul fragment, but if Voldemort does it, Harry is likely to survive the experience.

So, in summary: Dumbledore knows that there is at least one Horcrux by the end of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''. By the end of ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' he knows that there are at least two, and suspects the soul shard in Harry. His belief in the soul shard is firmed up by events in ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', and he is quite sure of its existence by Christmas in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. Dumbledore always knew Harry and Voldemort would have to fight, but was never sure of the outcome until the end of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', where he learned that Voldemort had taken Harry's blood and thus extended Harry's protection. At that point, he knew that despite Harry's vulnerability to any and all other wizards, Voldemort alone could never kill him, unless Harry allowed it; and he believed that Harry needed to be hit by a killing spell in order to destroy the soul shard. We suspect that knowing this, Dumbledore started a campaign, with Snape's assistance almost certainly, to convince Voldemort that he had to fight Harry directly. Dumbledore's program of strengthening and training Harry was specifically to make him less vulnerable to other chance encounters, and to give him the confidence in himself that would be required to allow him to face Voldemort. And it had to be kept secret from Harry, as his invulnerability to attacks from Voldemort was by no means certain; Dumbledore believed Voldemort could not kill Harry, but knew that he could certainly hurt or imprison Harry, or order some other Death Eater to kill him.

&lt;big&gt;'''Spinal Cord Compression Randomized Evidence'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Steroids==
*'''Copenhagen''' -- 96 mg dexamethasone vs. control
**Randomized. 57 patients with spinal cord compression. Arm 1) high-dose dexamethasone (IV bolus 96mg, then 96 mg x3 days, then 10 day taper) vs. Arm 2) no steroids
**'''1994''' PMID 8142159 -- &quot;Effect of high-dose dexamethasone in carcinomatous metastatic spinal cord compression treated with radiotherapy: a randomised trial.&quot; (Sorensen S, Eur J Cancer. 1994;30A(1):22-7.)
***Outcome: Gait function dexamethasone 81% vs. control 63%, 6-months later 59% vs. 33%. Median OS no difference
***Toxicity: Significant side effects 11%
***Conclusion: High-dose glucocorticoid therapy should be given as adjunct

*'''Rotterdam''' -- bolus 10 mg IV vs. bolus 100 mg IV
**Randomized. 37 patients with cord compresion. Arm 1) Dexamethasone bolus 10 mg IV vs. Arm 2) dexamethasone bolus 100 mg IV. Both followed by dexamethasone 16 mg daily
**'''1989''' PMID 2771077 -- &quot;Initial bolus of conventional versus high-dose dexamethasone in metastatic spinal cord compression.&quot; (Vecht CJ, Neurology. 1989 Sep;39(9):1255-7.)
***Outcome: Improved neurologic status: moderate 8% vs. high 25% (NS). Overall no difference in pain, ambulation, or bladder function
***Conclusion: No difference
***Comment: Small trial, and clinically significant difference (8% vs. 25%) if real

==Surgery==
*'''Bluegrass Neuro-Oncology Consortium''' (1992-2002) -- Surgery + RT vs. RT alone
**Randomized. ''Stopped early after meeting stopping rule.'' 101 patients, paraplegia &lt;=48 hours. Spinal cord compression from mets (excluded radiosensitive histologies, CNS primary). Decadron 100 mg, then 24 mg Q6. Arm 1) Surgery + RT vs. Arm 2) RT alone. 32 unable to walk (16 vs. 16). RT 30/10, field 8cm wide and one VB above/below lesion. RT started within 14 days post-op, or within 24 hrs of randomization. Endpoint ability to walk. 
**'''2008''' PMID 16112300 -- &quot;Direct decompressive surgical resection in the treatment of spinal cord compression caused by metastatic cancer: a randomised trial.&quot; (Patchell RA, Lancet. 2005 Aug 20-26;366(9486):643-8.)
***Ability to walk: surgery + RT 84% vs. RT alone 57% (SS). Length of response: 122 days vs. 13 days (SS). No improvement: surgery + RT 19% vs. RT alone 62% (SS)
****If ambulatory: Ability to walk 94% vs. 74% (SS); duration of response 153 days vs. 54 days (SS)
****If non-ambulatory: Ability to walk 62% vs. 19% (SS); duration of response 59 days vs. 0 days (SS)
***Cross-over: ambulatory patients treated with RT alone and failed, then treated with surgery: 30% able to walk
***Continence: surgery + RT 156 days vs. RT alone 17 days (SS); OS 126 days vs. 100 days (SS)
***Conclusion: Direct decompression + RT better than RT alone, even for patients who are ambulatory

==RT Dose==
*'''Italy''' (1998-2002) -- 16/2 (over 1 week) vs. 15/3 + 15/5 (over 2 weeks)
**Randomized. 300 patients, short life expectancy (&lt;=6 months), with metastatic spinal cord compression. Dexamethasone 8 mg IV BID, taper after end of RT. Arm 1) Short-course RT (8 Gy x 2 over 7 days) vs Arm 2) Split-course RT (5 Gy x 3, 4 day break, 3 Gy x 5). RT 2 VBs above and below.
**'''2005''' PMID 15738534 &amp;mdash; &quot;Short-Course Versus Split-Course Radiotherapy in Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression: Results of a Phase III, Randomized, Multicenter Trial.&quot; (Maranzano E et al. J Clin Oncol. 2005 May 20;23(15):3308-10.) 
***Outcome: Pain relief short 56% vs long 59% (NS), ambulation 68% vs. 71% (NS), bladder function 90% vs. 89% (NS). Median OS 4 months. Recurrence 2%, all in short course
***Toxicity: Grade 1-2 dysphagia 14%, Grade 1-2 diarrhea 7%
***Conclusion: Both regimens effective, short-course more convenient for patients</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Consider a curve of class of at least 3, with a nonzero curvature.

We shall now consider the rate of change of the osculating plane. Of course, when the curve is a plane curve, the osculating plane is the same as the plane of the curve, so it does not change, and consequently, the binormal vector also does not change. In other words, the derivative of the binormal vector, &lt;math&gt;\frac{db}{ds}&lt;/math&gt;, is 0.

Thus, let us consider the derivative of the binormal vector.

Consider the two equations &lt;math&gt;b \sdot b=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \sdot t=0&lt;/math&gt; and differentiate both of them in respect to the arc length parameter, to obtain &lt;math&gt;b \sdot \frac{db}{ds} =0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{db}{ds}\sdot t + b \sdot \frac{dt}{ds}&lt;/math&gt; and consequently &lt;math&gt;\frac{db}{ds}\sdot t = - b \sdot \frac{dt}{ds} = - \kappa b \sdot p = 0&lt;/math&gt; indicating that &lt;math&gt;\frac{db}{ds}&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to both '''b''' and '''p''' and thus lies on the principal normal line. Thus, we define the torsion &lt;math&gt;\tau(s)&lt;/math&gt; to be the proportionality between them:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{db}{ds}(s)=-\tau(s)p(s)&lt;/math&gt;

The negative sign is there so that it turns out that the torsion is positive for a right-handed helix.

We can take the dot product on both sides to get &lt;math&gt;\tau(s)=-p(s)\sdot \frac{db}{ds}(s)&lt;/math&gt;

Its reciprocal, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''radius of torsion'''.

#Prove that a curve is a plane curve if and only if its torsion is the null vector at every point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The derivatives of the vectors '''t''', '''p''', and '''b''' can be expressed as a linear combination of these vectors. The formulae for these expressions are called the Frenet-Serret Formulae. This is natural because '''t''', '''p''', and '''b''' form an orthogonal basis for a three-dimensional vector space.

Of course, we know already that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dt}{ds}=\kappa p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{db}{ds}=-\tau p&lt;/math&gt; so it remains to find &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{ds}&lt;/math&gt;. First, we differentiate &lt;math&gt;p \sdot p = 1&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{ds}\sdot p = 0&lt;/math&gt; so it takes on the form &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{ds}=at+cb&lt;/math&gt;. We take the dot product of this with '''t''' to obtain &lt;math&gt;a=\frac{dp}{ds}\sdot t&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the derivative of &lt;math&gt;p\sdot t=0&lt;/math&gt;, we get &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{ds}\sdot t + p \sdot \frac{dt}{ds} = 0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{ds}\sdot t=-p \sdot \frac{dt}{ds} = -\kappa p \sdot p = -\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. Also, taking the dot product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{ds}=at+cb&lt;/math&gt; with b, we obtain &lt;math&gt;c=\frac{dp}{ds}\sdot p&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the derivative of &lt;math&gt;p\sdot b=0&lt;/math&gt;, we get &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{ds}\sdot b=-p\sdot\frac{db}{ds}=\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we arrive at the following expression for &lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dp}{dt}=-\kappa t+\tau b&lt;/math&gt;.

This formula, combined with the previous two formulae, are together called the '''Frenet-Serret Formulae''' and they can be represented by a skew-symmetric matrix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, with the axiom of choice, commonly abbreviated ZFC, is the standard form of axiomatic set theory and as such is the most common foundation of mathematics.

ZFC consists of a single primitive notion, that of set, and a single assumption, namely that all mathematical objects are sets. There is a single primitive binary relation, set membership; that set a is a member of set b is written &lt;math&gt;a\in b&lt;/math&gt;  (usually read &quot;a is an element of b&quot; or &quot;a is in b&quot;). The axioms of ZFC govern how sets behave and interact.

== The axioms ==

'''1. Axiom of extensionality:''' Two sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [ \forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow x = y].&lt;/math&gt;
The converse of this axiom follows from the substitution property of equality. If the background logic does not include equality &quot;=&quot;, ''x''=''y'' may be defined as abbreviating &amp;forall;''z''[''z''&amp;isin;''x''&amp;harr;''z''&amp;isin;''y''] &amp;and; &amp;forall;''z''[''x''&amp;isin;''z''&amp;harr;''y''&amp;isin;''z''], in which case this axiom can be reformulated as &lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y [ \forall z (z \in x \Leftrightarrow z \in y) \Rightarrow \forall z (x \in z \Leftrightarrow y \in z) ]&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; if  ''x'' and ''y'' have the same elements, then they belong to the same sets.

'''2. Axiom of regularity''' (also called the ''Axiom of foundation''): Every non-empty set ''x'' contains a member ''y'' such that ''x'' and ''y'' are disjoint sets.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x [ \exists y ( y \in x) \Rightarrow \exists y ( y \in x \land \lnot \exists z (z \in y \land z \in x))].&lt;/math&gt;

'''3. Axiom schema of specification''' (also called the axiom schema of ''separation'' or of ''restricted comprehension''): If ''z'' is a set, and &lt;math&gt;\phi\!&lt;/math&gt; is any property which may characterize the elements ''x'' of ''z'', then there is a subset ''y'' of ''z'' containing those ''x'' in ''z'' which satisfy the property. More formally:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall z \forall w_1 \ldots w_n \exists y \forall x [x \in y \Leftrightarrow ( x \in z \land \phi )].&lt;/math&gt;

The axiom of specification can be used to prove the existence of the empty set, denoted &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, once the existence of at least one set is established (see above). A common way to do this is to use an instance of specification for a property which all sets do not have. For example, if ''w'' is a set which already exists, the empty set can be constructed as
:&lt;math&gt;\varnothing = \{u \in w \mid (u \in u) \land \lnot (u \in u) \}&lt;/math&gt;. 
If the background logic includes equality, it is also possible to define the empty set as 
:&lt;math&gt;\varnothing = \{u \in w \mid \lnot (u = u) \}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Thus the axiom of the empty set is implied by the nine axioms presented here.  The axiom of extensionality implies the empty set is unique, if it exists. It is common to make a definitional extension that adds the symbol &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; to the language of ZFC. 

'''4. Axiom of pairing:''' If ''x'' and ''y'' are sets, then there exists a set which contains ''x'' and ''y'' as elements.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \forall y \exist z (x \in z \land y \in z).&lt;/math&gt;

'''5. Axiom of union:''' For any set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; there is a set ''A'' containing every set that is a member of some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \mathcal{F} \,\exists A \, \forall Y\, \forall x (x \in Y \land Y \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow x \in A).&lt;/math&gt;

'''6. Axiom schema of collection:''' This axiom states that if the domain of a function ''f'' is a set, and ''f''(''x'') is a set for any ''x'' in that domain, then the range of ''f'' is a subclass of a set, subject to a restriction needed to avoid paradoxes.

'''7. Axiom of infinity:''' Let &lt;math&gt;S(x)\!&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt; x \cup \{x\} \!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x \!&lt;/math&gt; is some set. Then there exists a set ''X'' such that the empty set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a member of ''X'' and, whenever a set ''y'' is a member of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;S(y)\!&lt;/math&gt; is also a member of ''X''. 
:&lt;math&gt;\exist X \left [\varnothing \in X \and \forall y (y \in X \Rightarrow S(y)  \in X)\right ].&lt;/math&gt;
More colloquially, there exists a set ''X'' having infinitely many members. 

'''8. Axiom of power set:''' Let &lt;math&gt;z \subseteq x&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt;\forall q (q \in z \Rightarrow q \in x).&lt;/math&gt; For any set ''x'', there is a set ''y'' which is a superset of the power set of ''x''. The power set of ''x'' is the class whose members are every possible subset of ''x''.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \exists y  \forall z [z \subseteq x \Rightarrow z \in y].&lt;/math&gt;

Alternative forms of axioms '''1&amp;ndash;8''' are often encountered. Some ZF axiomatizations include an axiom asserting that the empty set exists. The axioms of pairing, union, replacement, and power set are often stated so that the members of the set ''x'' whose existence is being asserted, are just those sets which the axiom asserts ''x'' must contain.

'''9. Well-ordering theorem:''' For any set ''X'', there is a binary relation ''R'' which well-orders ''X''.  This means ''R'' is a linear order on ''X'' such that every nonempty subset of ''X'' has a member which is minimal under ''R''.
:&lt;math&gt;\forall X \exists R ( R \;\mbox{well-orders}\; X).&lt;/math&gt;

Given axioms '''1-8''', there are many statements provably equivalent to axiom '''9''', the best known of which is the axiom of choice (AC), which goes as follows. Let ''X'' be a set whose members are all non-empty. Then there exists a function ''f'', called a &quot;choice function,&quot; whose domain is ''X'', and whose range is a set, called the &quot;choice set,&quot; each member of which is a single member of each member of ''X''. Since the existence of a choice function when ''X'' is a finite set is easily proved from axioms '''1-8''', AC only matters for certain infinite sets. AC is characterized as nonconstructive because it asserts the existence of a choice set but says nothing about how the choice set is to be &quot;constructed.&quot;  Much research has sought to characterize the definability (or lack thereof) of certain sets whose existence AC asserts.

== Standard form? ==

The first section gives a linear program in &quot;standard form&quot;; however, it'd be best if the term &quot;standard&quot; was avoided as there may be no &quot;standard&quot;. For example, the &quot;standard form&quot; of ''Introduction to Algorithms'' (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein), a widely used textbook, looks like this: 

&lt;math&gt;6x_1 + 4x_2 \leq 24&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_1 + 2x_2 \leq 6&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;-x_1 + x_2 \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x_2 \leq 2&lt;/math&gt;

--[[User:Adevish|Adevish]] ([[User talk:Adevish|talk]]) 21:54, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
:What you want would have been more appropriate if the page was on wikipedia because a certain amount of latitude in notation is available on wikibooks. Most OR books include some definition of standard form, and this book is only obeying the established ''standard'' by including one. Nevertheless, if you still think it might confuse readers, perhaps we should use some other terminology, like canonical.--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 08:34, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

:: The module could be edited to make it clear that it was ''defining'' &quot;standard form&quot; as such-and-such; the current phrasing doesn't make that clear. --[[User:Adevish|Adevish]] ([[User talk:Adevish|talk]]) 03:02, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

== The 2-Phase example is wrong, algorithm not clearly laid out ==

The example beginning:

Minimize: z=4x1 + x2

Subject to:
3x1 + x2 = 3&lt;br /&gt;
4x1 + 3x2 &amp;gt;= 6&lt;br /&gt;
x1 + 2x2 &amp;lt;= 4&lt;br /&gt;
x1, x2 &amp;gt;= 0&lt;br /&gt;


has the unique solution:
x1 = 2/5&lt;br /&gt;
x2 =9/5&lt;br /&gt;
z= 17/5&lt;br /&gt;

This highlights several problems:
I am familiar with linear algebra and matrix manipulations, yet I am unable to determine the error, because the presentation of gaussian elimination and the process of &quot;optimization&quot; and pivot selection are not presented.  It is unclear what the simplex method is.  For example, how do I go about the minimization process?  How is it different from maximization?  I know what the answer is according to the present text, but only because I was able to replicate its matrix result, which is wrong.  There are unnecessary steps, which I am happy to discuss in detail if anyone is currently managing this project.

Overall, I think the expectations on the reader are erratic.  In some places, we are clearly invoking additional terminology and ad-hoc explanations to appeal to someone who is not interested in understanding the linear algebra behind it.  But in other places, we get &quot;the obvious matrix operation is&quot;, and yet this will be incomprehensible to anyone not already familiar with matrix manipulation.

I think that simple facts should be stated and demonstrated.  There need to be examples.  The reader should be told explicitly (and not as a throw-away to those &quot;already familiar&quot;) that two rows can be added together without altering the solution.  Then this row operation is avaiable to the user, and s/he can decide how to go about it.  I, for one, do not find the &quot;pivot&quot; explanation to be at all clear, and it is ONLY because I already know the elementary row operations and the principle behind the &quot;pivot&quot; that it made any sense.

The presentation of graphical solutions is poor.  The explanation for how to &quot;tell&quot; that a line bounds a region by plugging in numbers is again, useless without a straightforward explanation.  For example, given the constraint&lt;br /&gt;
6x1 + 4x2 &amp;lt;= 24&lt;br /&gt;
make it clear that we can draw the line
x2 &amp;lt;= -(3/2)x1 + 6&lt;br /&gt;
and then shade the region below the line because &quot;x1 is equal to or less than this line (bound)&quot;.  NOW the reader can double-check him/herself by plugging in values.  Take a sentence or two to remind the reader that s/he can add quantities to both sides without affecting the inequality, just as with =, that positive scalar multiplication of both sides holds, and that multiplying by -1 changes the direction of the inequality.

I find that upper division pure math textbooks have no qualms taking multiple pages to remind readers of the basic algebraic operations, any time new algebraic ideas are introduced.  And inequalities are puzzling for anyone who doesn't work with them regularly.  This text depends upon using them variously, it can stand the addition of clear, basic procedures with examples.

Because the algorithm is broken, and it is never presented.

I found the answer easily using Gaussian elimination in a Jordan matrix, but that's because it's a trivial solution.  I am not clear what the ramifications of sign are to the max/min procedure or to Phase1/Phase2, because at no point is the procedure unambiguously stated.  &quot;We are going to do THIS in EXACTLY THE FOLLOWING WAY, until we have achieved the following unambiguous result.&quot;  The simplex method, I presume, is an algorithm.  Then give it.  Every step not in the text is a step that is missing.  What use is an instructional book if, in the end, I have never been given the algorithm?

I eliminated sx6 in the 2 Phase example because
Z + (1/5)sx6 = 18/5&lt;br /&gt;
wasn't optimized.  But the positive sign in the Z row is cited explicitly as the reason that we are done.  And yet these rules about signs are never given, the procedure by which the author reduces the Phase 1 matrix is never given (all that is said is that &quot;the simplex method is now applied&quot;, and yet it is evident to anyone following along that it cannot be applied in EXACTLY THE SAME WAY as it was in the previous example), and the author is mistaken about them, whatever they actually are.

Finally, I should like a better example.  This two-phase example is a waste of time.  The first constraint is 3x1 + x2 = 3.&lt;br /&gt;

That's an equal sign.  We're done.

x2 = 3 - 3x1&lt;br /&gt;

...and substitute into the other constraints.  We find right away that
x1 &amp;lt;= 3/5&lt;br /&gt;
x1 &amp;gt;= 2/5&lt;br /&gt;
are the two strictest constraints.  We are minimizing Z = x1 + 3, and the answer is x1 = 2/5.


Normally, I would consider this to be a minor oversight, but at every step the author fails to stop and identify the criteria to be taken into account, and to then do so, as a straightforward and unhurried matter of demonstration.  When doing multivariable optimization, it is ESSENTIAL to recognize, as a matter of procedure, simple ways to reduce the number of variables before entering time-consuming analysis.  I understand that the author used a computer program.  This screen shot is useless, because the answer is incorrect, and it is to me indicative of the single, crippling flaw of a text that I would very much like to see rewritten.  Good self-instructing math texts are hard to come by and I would like to see this text take responsibility for introducing the ideas that it claims it does not take for granted, then takes for granted.  It could be an excellent free resource, the overall layout plan is good.  Structurally, I am all for it.  Algorithms are unambiguous procedures.  Name each step, and the text will correct itself, and will be accessible.

I'm not super into business, and my interests are largely elsewhere.  I'd rather not be the one to try to rework this text.  However, I would be happy to assist whomever is currently working on it, if these criticisms prove troublesome to rectify.  My intention is not to be overly criticial.  It's just math, that's all.  Errors need to be corrected.  When those errors raise questions about what the author intends, it is worth mentioning.  But I never state objections as rhetorical questions.  I mean the words literally, so if I say it's unclear to me what the author is doing, that does NOT mean &quot;I don't like you and you're bad at this.&quot; That means, &quot;I don't know what you are doing or why.&quot;  And I am unable to assist or offer fully useful suggestions if I don't.  Solutions require knowing what went wrong, and with the implementation of the rote mathematics of this text, I am not sure what is going wrong.

      <comment>Instructions to install Ubuntu in VirtualBox</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Virtualization is a system where an operating system can be installed into another host operating system.
The technology involves using some space on the hard disk where the virtual system would be installed and operated.
There are many free and proprietary software for virtualization. VMware and VirtualBox are 2 such examples.

When an operating system is installed in a virtual box it behaves exactly the same and the end user would not even know that a system is actually running in another operating system. This way one need not partition the hard disk for another operating system.

This becomes particularly useful for testing an operating system before deciding to actually use it as a complete replacement, or using virtual machines for software development. When we think of this option as an intermediate phase in the migration process, one can think of installing Ubuntu inside Windows and using it for some days with all its features and capabilities. When users get familiar with the partitioning and other complex tasks they can confidently install Ubuntu directly.

===For VirtualBox===

# Download the Ubuntu ISO from Canonical's website.
# Download the Oracle VM VirtualBox.
# Create a new virtual machine. You should give it the name &quot;Ubuntu&quot; and, if needed, select Ubuntu in the OS dropdown list.
# Select how much RAM you will allocate to your virtual machine. Too much RAM and your host operating system will not run while the guest is running, which causes it to fail sometimes.
# Select &quot;Create a virtual hard drive now&quot;.
# Select a dynamically allocated or a fixed size disk. A dynamically allocated virtual hard drive will keep growing and growing until your computer hits its hard drive limit. A fixed size virtual hard drive will keep growing until it hits the fixed size.
# Select the limit for the hard drive. Let it create the virtual hard drive.
USE THE ISO:
# Click on &quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Storage&quot;.
# Click the CD/DVD icon with a + on it to select the ISO.
# Choose the Ubuntu ISO.
# Click on &quot;System&quot; and set the boot priority to CD/DVD first, so the virtual machine will boot into Ubuntu.
INSTALL UBUNTU
# Open the Ubuntu virtual machine.
# Select the language.
# Double-click Install Ubuntu.
# Install Ubuntu while answering the questions, and voila!

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Greek mathematician Euclid gave the following elegant proof that there are an infinite number of primes. It relies on the fact that all non-prime numbers --- composites --- have a unique factorization into primes.

Euclid's proof works by contradiction: we will assume that there are a finite number of primes, and show that we can derive a logically contradictory fact.

So here we go. First, we assume that that there are a finite number of primes:

: p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

Now consider the number M defined as follows:

: M = 1 +  p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; *  p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; * ... *  p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

There are two important --- and ultimately contradictory --- facts about the number M:

# It cannot be prime because p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the biggest prime (by our initial assumption), and M is clearly bigger than p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, there must be some prime p that divides M.
# It is not divisible by any of the numbers p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.   Consider what would happen if you tried to divide M by any of the primes in the list p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  From the definition of M, you can tell that you would end up with a remainder of 1. That means that p --- the prime that divides M --- must be bigger than any of p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Thus, we have shown that M is divisible by a prime p that is not on the finite list of all prime. And so there must be an infinite number of primes.


These two facts imply that M must be divisible by a prime number bigger than p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, there cannot be a biggest prime.

Note that this proof does not provide us with a direct way to generate arbitrarily large primes, although it always generates a number which is divisible by a new prime. Suppose we know only one prime: 2.  So, our list of primes is simply p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=2. Then, in the notation of the proof, M=1+2=3.  We note that M is prime, so we add 3 to the list.  Now, M = 1 +2 *3 = 7.  Again, 7 is prime.  So we add it to the list.  Now, M = 1+2*3*7 = 43: again prime.  Continuing in this way one more time, we calculate M = 1+2*3*7*43 = 1807 =13*139.  So we see that M is not prime. 

Viewed another way: note that while 1+2, 1+2*3, 1+2*3*5, 1+2*3*5*7, and 1+2*3*5*7*11 are prime, 1+2*3*5*7*11*13=30031=59*509 is not.

== ਪੰਛੀ - Birds ==
[[Image:Pavo_cristatus_male.jpg|thumb|250px|ਮੋਰ - Peacock]]
Bird is called ਪੰਛੀ in Punjabi. ਮੋਰ i.e. peacock, a symbol of grace, joy, beauty and love, is the National bird of India. It looks beautiful when it fans its tail feathers. 
Here are some more birds.

#ਤੋਤਾ = parrot  
#ਬਟੇਰਾ = quail
#ਬਗਲਾ = egret
#ਕਬੂਤਰ = pigeon  
#ਤਿੱਤਰ = partridge
#ਕੋਇਲ = nightingale
#ਬਾਜ = hawk 
#ਚੀਲ = kite 
#ਇੱਲ = eagle 
#ਚਿੜੀ = sparrow 
#ਘੁੱਗੀ = dove 
#ਗਟਾਰ = mynah 
#ਬਤਖ਼ = duck 
#ਹੰਸ = swan 
#ਕੁੱਕੜ = cock, rooster, cockerel
#ਉੱਲੂ = owl
#ਕਾਂ = crow &lt;br&gt;

== Grammar ==
Let us introduce some simple grammar here. We start with number of the noun. The singular is ਇੱਕ ਵਚਨ and plural is ਬਹੁ ਵਚਨ in Punjabi.&lt;br&gt;
#Regular Punjabi nouns end with kanna(ਆ). Plurals of regular nouns are formed by replacing kanna(ਆ) with lanv(ਏ).&lt;br&gt;
#Plurals of irregular nouns are formed by adding airha plus kanna with a bindi (ਆਂ) when the noun ends with a vowel and in other cases by adding kanna with bindi to the noun.

== Exercises ==
1. Write names of ten birds in Punjabi. &lt;br&gt;
2. Write the plural forms of the following regular Punjabi nouns.
#ਤੋਤਾ 
#ਬਟੇਰਾ
#ਬਗਲਾ
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#ਤੋਤੇ
#ਬਟੇਰੇ
#ਬਗਲੇ}}
3. Write the plural forms of the following Punjabi nouns.
#ਚਿੜੀ
#ਬਤਖ਼
#ਗਟਾਰ 
#ਤਿੱਤਰ
#ਕਬੂਤਰ
#ਬਾਜ
#ਮੋਰ
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#ਚਿੜੀਆਂ
#ਬਤਖ਼ਾਂ
#ਗਟਾਰਾਂ 
#ਤਿੱਤਰਾਂ
#ਕਬੂਤਰਾਂ
#ਬਾਜਾਂ
#ਮੋਰਾਂ}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we will undergo a throughout study of &lt;math&gt;C(K)&lt;/math&gt;, the space of all real-valued or complex-valued functions on a compact space. &lt;!-- Shall we assume K is Hausdorff? --&gt; The most important result in the line of this study is Ascoli's theorem and Stone-Weierstrass theorem. For simplicity, we assume functions in &lt;math&gt;C(K)&lt;/math&gt; are real-valued. (A discussion will be given later as to why this does not diminish the generality.)

As usual, we topologizes &lt;math&gt;C(K)&lt;/math&gt; by the norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \| = \sup | \cdot |&lt;/math&gt;. To say that &lt;math&gt;C(K)&lt;/math&gt; is complete is precisely:&lt;br /&gt;
'''2. Lemma''' ''The limit of a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions is continuous.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;f_n \in C(K)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence such that &lt;math&gt;\sup_K |f_n - f| \to 0&lt;/math&gt; for some function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, by the iterated limit theorem,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{y \to x} f(y) = \lim_{n \to 0} \lim_{y \to x} f_n(y) = \lim_{n \to 0} f_n(x) = f(x).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, &lt;math&gt;C(K)&lt;/math&gt; is a Banach space. (For the definition and basic results of Banach spaces, see [[Functional Analysis]].)

'''2 Theorem (Ascoli)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \subset C(K)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; is relatively compact if and only if''
*''(i) Given an &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, we can find a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that''
*:''&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;y \in G&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;''
*''(ii) &lt;math&gt;\sup_\Gamma | \cdot (x)| &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;''
Proof: First, assume that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is relatively compact. (ii) is then obvious. For (i), let &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt; be given. For each &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, by continuity, we can find a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;G_f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;y \in G_f&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is relatively compact, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; contains a finite subset &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the union of the sets of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\{ f; f \in \Gamma, \sup_K |f - g| &lt; \epsilon / 3 \}&lt;/math&gt;
over &lt;math&gt;g \in \gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be the intersection of &lt;math&gt;G_g&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;g \in \gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Then for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, there is &lt;math&gt;g \in \gamma &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\sup_K |f - g| &lt; \epsilon / 3&lt;/math&gt;, and so:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| \le |f(y) - g(y)| + |g(y) - g(x)| + |g(x) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;y \in G&lt;/math&gt;.
This proves (i). Next, suppose &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; satisfies (i) and (ii). To show that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is totally bounded, let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. For each &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, by (i), we can find a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon / 3&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;y \in G_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.
Since &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact, we can find &lt;math&gt;z_1, ... z_n \in K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is the union of &lt;math&gt;G_{z_j}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;j = 1, 2, ... n&lt;/math&gt;. Let
:&lt;math&gt;A = \{ (f(z_1), f(z_2), ... f(z_n)); f \in \Gamma \}&lt;/math&gt;.
By (ii), &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded (thus totally bounded) subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. That means that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; contains a finite subset &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;A \subset \bigcup_{g \in \gamma} \{ (t_1, ... t_n); t_j \in \mathbf{R}, \max_j | t_j - g(z_j) | &lt; \epsilon / 3 \}&lt;/math&gt;
It now follows: given &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, we can find &lt;math&gt;g \in \gamma&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\max_j | f(z_j) - g(z_j) | &lt; \epsilon / 3&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, for each &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;x \in G_{z_k}&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x) - g(x)| \le |f(x) - f(z_k)| + |f(z_k) - g(z_k)| + |g(z_k) - g(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, &lt;math&gt;\sup_K |f - g| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is totally bounded, or equivalently, relatively compact. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f_n \in C(K)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly convergent if and only if it is pointwise convergent and equicontinuous.''&lt;br /&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; converge pointwise to &lt;math&gt;f \in C(K)&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;{f_n}'&lt;/math&gt; exists and converges uniformly to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable and its derivative is &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;M = \sup \{ |f_n'(x)| | n \ge 1, x \in K \}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is finite by uniform convergence. By the mean value theorem,
:&lt;math&gt;|f_n(y) - f_n(x)| \le M|y-x|&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is equicontinuous and converges uniformly by Ascoli's thoerem (or one of its corollaries.) &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--
'''2 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; be an equicontinuous sequence in &lt;math&gt;C(K)&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that fn(x) converges for all x ∈ D, where D is a dense subset of X. Then, fn(x) converges for all x ∈ X, and the limit function is continuous.--&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be an equicontinous set of real-valued functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\sup_{f \in \Gamma}|f(0)| = b &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then there exist an &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{f \in \Gamma} |f(x)| \le a|x| + b + 1&lt;/math&gt;
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be such that:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(y)| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|x - y| &lt; 2\delta&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt; 2\delta&lt;/math&gt; isn't a typo; it is meant to simplify the computation.)
Let &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be fixed. Then, for any &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)| \le |f(x) - f(0)| + |f(0)|&lt;/math&gt;,
and we estimate:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(0) - f(x)| \le \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} |f(k\delta) - f((k+1)\delta)| + |f(n\delta) - f(x)| \le n+1&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is such that &lt;math&gt;n\delta &lt; x \le (n+1)\delta&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)| \le \delta^{-1}|x| + 1 + b&lt;/math&gt;
Since we can get the same estimate for &lt;math&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the proof is complete.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary (Dini's theorem)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f_n \in \mathcal{C}(K)&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence such that &lt;math&gt;f_n(x) \to f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is increasing, then &lt;math&gt;f_n \to f&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Set &lt;math&gt;g_n = f - f_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;g_n&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing and thus satisfies the hypothesis of Ascoli's theorem. Hence, &lt;math&gt;g_n&lt;/math&gt; admits a convergent subsequence, which converges to 0 since the subsequence converges pointwise to 0. Since &lt;math&gt;g_n&lt;/math&gt; is decreasing, &lt;math&gt;g_n&lt;/math&gt; converges as well. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Suppose &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \subset C(K)&lt;/math&gt; is equicontinuous if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(y)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x, y \in K&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|x - y| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: &lt;math&gt;(\Leftarrow)&lt;/math&gt; holds vacuously. For the converse, let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Then for each &lt;math&gt;x \in K&lt;/math&gt;, we can find &lt;math&gt;\delta_x&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|x - y| &lt; \delta_x&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(y)| &lt; \epsilon / 2&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;
By compactness, we find &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, ... x_n \in K&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;K \subset \bigcup_j B(x_j, \delta_{x_j} / 2)&lt;/math&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\delta = \min \{ \delta_{x_1}, \delta_{x_2}, ... \delta_{x_n} \} / 2&lt;/math&gt;, and then suppose we are given &lt;math&gt;x, y \in K&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|x - y| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;. It follows: there is a &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|x - x_j| &lt; \delta_{x_j} / 2&lt;/math&gt;. Since
:&lt;math&gt;|y - x_j| \le |y - x| + |x - x_j| &lt; \delta + \delta_{x_j} / 2 \le \delta_{x_j}&lt;/math&gt;,
we have:
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f(y)| \le |f(x) - f(x_j)| + |f(x_j) - f(y)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;f \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The Stone-Weierstrass theorem states that polynomials are dense in C(K, ''R''). It is however not the case that the space of polynomials in ''z'' is a dense in C(K, ''C''). If it were, we have the equality in the below
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{P(K)} \subset A(K) \subset C(K)&lt;/math&gt;
But &lt;math&gt;A(K) \ne C(K)&lt;/math&gt; if K has nonempty interior.

'''2 Theorem (intermediate value theorem)''' ''A function &lt;math&gt;f:[a, b] \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous if and only if
*''(i) If &lt;math&gt;f(a) &lt; c &lt; f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''c'' is in &lt;math&gt;f((a, b))&lt;/math&gt;.''
*''(ii) If &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{c\})&lt;/math&gt; is closed for every real ''c''.''
Proof: (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) Obvious. (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) Suppose &lt;math&gt;f(x) &lt; c&lt;/math&gt;. Since the complement of &lt;math&gt; f^{-1}(\{c\})&lt;/math&gt;, which contains ''x'',  is open, we have: &lt;math&gt;f \ne c&lt;/math&gt; in some interval ''U'' in &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt; containing ''x''. We actually have: &lt;math&gt;f &lt; c&lt;/math&gt; in ''U''. In fact, if &lt;math&gt;y \in U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c &lt; f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x) &lt; c &lt; f(y)&lt;/math&gt;, which implies ''U'' contains a point ''z'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(z) = c&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction. Hence, ''f'' is upper semicontinous at ''x''. The same argument applied to &lt;math&gt;-f&lt;/math&gt; shows that ''f'' is also lower semicontinous at ''x''. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued continuous function on an open interval. Then the following are equivalent.''
*''(i) ''f'' is injective.''
*''(ii) ''f'' is strictly monotonic.''
*''(iii) ''f'' is an open mapping.''
Proof: (ii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (i) is obvious. (iii) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; (ii): If (ii) is false, then we can assume there exists &lt;math&gt;a &lt; c &lt; b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a) &lt; f(c)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(c) &gt; f(b)&lt;/math&gt;. By continuity and compactness, ''f'' attains a maximum in some point ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;[a, b]&lt;/math&gt; but by hypothesis &lt;math&gt;x \in (a, b)&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a non-interior point of &lt;math&gt;f((a, b))&lt;/math&gt;, falsifying (iii). If (iii) is false, then &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; contains a ''x'' such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is not an interior point of &lt;math&gt;f( (a, b) )&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;f( (a, b) )&lt;/math&gt; is an interval, we may assume that &lt;math&gt;\sup_{ (a, b) } f = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. It then follows from the intermediate value theorem that ''f'' is not injective. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem (mean value theorem)''' ''Suppose &lt;math&gt;f \in C([a, b], \mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable on the open interval &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then''
:&lt;math&gt;f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b - a)&lt;/math&gt;
''for some &lt;math&gt;c \in (a, b)&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: FIrst assume &lt;math&gt;0 = f(a) = f(b)&lt;/math&gt;. By the theorem preceding this one, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; attains a maximum or minimum at &lt;math&gt;x \in (a, b)&lt;/math&gt;; say, a maximum. By definition, we can write:
:&lt;math&gt;f(y) = f(x) + f'(x)(y - x) + o(|y-x|)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;y \to x&lt;/math&gt;
Then since ''x'' is a maximum,
:&lt;math&gt;0 \ge f(y) - f(x) = f'(x)(y - x) + o(|y-x|)&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;y &gt; x&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;0 \ge f'(x) + O(|y-x|)&lt;/math&gt;
and letting &lt;math&gt;x \to 0&lt;/math&gt; gives that &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \le 0&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;y &lt; x&lt;/math&gt;, then by the same argument, we find that &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f'(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. For the general case, let
:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = f(x) - rx&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;r = {f(b) - f(a) \over b - a}&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;g(a) = g(b) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, applying the first part of the proof gives: &lt;math&gt;g'(c) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for some ''c''. Since  &lt;math&gt;0 = g'(c) = f'(c) - r&lt;/math&gt;, ''c'' is a solution of the equation. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a differentiable function. If &lt;math&gt;f'(a) &lt; c &lt; f'(b)&lt;/math&gt;, then ''c'' is in &lt;math&gt;f'((a, b))&lt;/math&gt;.'' &lt;br /&gt;
Proof:Let &lt;math&gt;g(x) = f(x) - cx&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;g'(a) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g'(b) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is increasing at ''a'' and decreasing at ''b''. By the theorem above, ''g'' is not injective on &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., &lt;math&gt;g(x) = g(x')&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x \ne x'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;. It follows:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = g(x) - g(x') = g'(y)(x - x')&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;y \in (a, b)&lt;/math&gt;.
and &lt;math&gt;g'(y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''A strictly monotonic continuous function with closed range is a homeomorphism.''

A real-valued function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be homogeneous of degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; could be any real number) if
:&lt;math&gt;f(tx) = t^k f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;t &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2 Theorem (Euler's relation)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; be a function differentiable on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n \backslash \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is homogeneous of degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; if and only if:
:&lt;math&gt;\left( \sum_j x_j \partial_j - k \right) f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
Proof: (&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) Differentiate with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; both sides of &lt;math&gt;f(tx) = t^k f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and then put &lt;math&gt;t = 1&lt;/math&gt;. (&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) Note
:&lt;math&gt;(f(tx))' = \sum_j x_j {\partial_j f}(tx) = {k \over t} f(tx)&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, if we let
:&lt;math&gt;g(t) = \log \left| {f(tx) \over t^k f(x)} \right| = \log |f(tx)| - k\log t - \log|f(x)|&lt;/math&gt;,
then the derivative of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; vanishes identically. Since &lt;math&gt;g(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is identically zero. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The theorem permits a generalization. By definition, any (distribution) solution of the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\left( \sum_j x_j \partial_j - k \right) f = 0&lt;/math&gt;
is said to be ''homogeneous of degree &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.''

A homogeneous distribution is tempered and its Fourier transform is homogeneous.

'''2 Theorem (l'Hôpital's rule)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;0 \le a \le \infty&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;f(x), g(x) \to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x \to a&lt;/math&gt; or if &lt;math&gt;g(x) \to \infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x \to a&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} {f(x) \over g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a} {f'(x) \over g'(x)}&lt;/math&gt;
provided the limit in the right-hand side exists.&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: First assume &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is finite. We may redefine &lt;math&gt;f(a) = g(a) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (since the values of functions at &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; are immaterial when we compute the limit.) Fix &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and define
:&lt;math&gt;h(y) = f(y)g(x) - f(x)g(y)&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;h(x) = 0 = h(a)&lt;/math&gt;, by the mean value theorem, we can find a &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;0 = h'(c) = f'(c)g(x) - f(x)g'(c)&lt;/math&gt;
Since when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is close to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; we may assume &lt;math&gt;g'&lt;/math&gt; never vanishes,
:&lt;math&gt;{ f(x) \over g(x) } = { f'(c) \over g'(c) }&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;c \to a&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x \to a&lt;/math&gt;, the proof of this case is complete. (TODO: handle other cases.) &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

The next theorem can be skipped without the loss of continuity, for more general results will later be obtained.

'''2 Theorem (The Weierstrass approximation theorem)''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;f \in C([0, 1])&lt;/math&gt;, and define
:&lt;math&gt;f_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n f(k/n)p^n_k(x)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p^n_k(x) = {n \choose k} x^k (1-x)^{n-k}&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Bernstein polynomial]]).
Then &lt;math&gt;f_n \to f&lt;/math&gt; uniformly on &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proof [http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~wasserm/FA.ps]: First note that
:&lt;math&gt;1 = \sum_{k=0}^n p^n_k(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is a partition of unity, by the binomial theorem applied to &lt;math&gt;(x + 1 - x)^n&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, a simple computation gives the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum (nx - k)^2 p^n_k(x) = nx(x-1)&lt;/math&gt;
It thus follows: for any &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x) - f_n(x)| \le \sum_{k : |nx - k| &lt; n\delta} |f(x) - f(k / n)| + {nx(x-1) \over n^2 \delta^2} &lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous on &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; by compactness, the theorem now follows. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Corollary''' ''Any continuous function vanishing at infinity is uniformly approximated by Hermite function. (TODO: made the statement more precise and give a proof.)

Example: Let &lt;math&gt;f \in L^2([0, 1])&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be the linear span of polynomials. Then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a dense subspace of &lt;math&gt;L^2([0, 1])&lt;/math&gt; by the above theorem since
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 |f - p_n|^2 dx \le \sup|f - p_n|^2 \to 0&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem''' ''If &lt;math&gt;f \in C(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly continuous and integrable, then &lt;math&gt;f \in C_0(\mathbf{R})&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Define &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is integrable means that &lt;math&gt;M = \lim_{x \to \infty} F(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists and is finite. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; be given. By uniform continuity, there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;|y-x| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;.
Then there is an &lt;math&gt;R &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;|F(x + \delta) - F(x)| &lt; \delta\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;x &gt; R&lt;/math&gt;
Now, let &lt;math&gt;x &gt; R&lt;/math&gt; be given. By the mean value theorem, we find &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\delta f(y) = F(x + \delta) - F(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|x - y| &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt;. Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;|f(x)| \le |f(x) - f(y)| + \delta^{-1}|F(x + \delta) - M | + \delta^{-1}|M - F(x)| &lt; 3\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example''' ''No function is continuous only on rational points. To see this, let &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a function, and let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all points at which &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. It follows immediately from the definition of continuity that &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., it is an intersection of countably many open sets. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is not &lt;math&gt;G_\delta&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''2 Theorem''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;U \subset \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty open subset.
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_U |f| \le 2 \sqrt{\sup_U |f'| \sup_U |f''|}&lt;/math&gt;
Proof:
Let &lt;math&gt;A = \sup_U |f'|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B = \sup_U |f'|&lt;/math&gt;. We assume &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are finite; otherwise the inequality is trivial. Given &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, we can find &lt;math&gt;h &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; so that an interval &lt;math&gt;[x, x + h] \subset U&lt;/math&gt;. By Taylor's formula,
:&lt;math&gt;f(x + h) = f(x) + f'(x)h + f''(x + \theta h)h^2&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;)
and so:
:&lt;math&gt;|f'(x)| \le {A \over h} + Bh&lt;/math&gt;
Now, take &lt;math&gt;h = {\sqrt{A} \over \sqrt{B}}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''2 Theorem (Whitney extension theorem)''' ''Every real-valued L-Lipschitz function on a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is the restriction of a L-Lipschitz function on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof ([http://www.math.jyu.fi/research/reports/rep100.pdf] pg. 5): Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a L-Lipschitz function on a subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Define
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \inf_{y \in A} (f(y) + L|x - y|) \qquad (x \in \mathbf{R}^n)&lt;/math&gt;
It is clear that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is L-Lipschitz continuous. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

Exercise: Every closed set is a zero set of a &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; function.

===a. The domestic cat known as Sphynx first appeared in the late 1960s. Which of the following is true about this Canadian breed?&lt;br&gt;(1) It is too wild to be a proper house cat.&lt;br&gt;(2) It is the national pet of Canada.&lt;br&gt;(3) It appears to be hairless.===
[[Image:Sphinx2_July_2006.jpg|thumb|Sphynx]]
The Sphynx (aka Canadian Hairless) is a rare breed of cat with extremely little fur, or at most a short fuzz over its body, and no, or very short and stiff whiskers. Their skin is the color their fur would be, and all the usual cat marking patterns (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found in Sphynx too. They are sometimes mistaken for Chihuahuas because of their extremely unusual and, some say, uncatlike appearance. They are extremely intelligent, extroverted, and affectionate, often cuddling with their owners, other humans, and each other.

===b. True or False: The Chartreux, with its brilliant orange eyes and blue lips, is a breed closely associated with France.===
[[Image:Chartreux cat J adult female 001.jpg|thumb|Chartruex cat]]
True.

The Chartreux is an internationally recognized breed of domestic cat from France. There is a legend that the Chartreux are descended from cats brought to France by Carthusian monks to live in the order's head monastery, the Grande Chartreuse, located in the Chartreuse Mountains north of the city of Grenoble (Siegal 1997:27). But in 1972, the Prior of the Grande Chartreuse denied that the monastery's archives held any records of the monks' use of any breed of cat resembling the Chartreux (Simonnet 1990:36–37). Legend also has it that the Chartreux's ancestors were feral mountain cats from what is now Syria, brought back to France by returning Crusaders in the 13th century, many of whom entered the Carthusian monastic order. The first documented mention of the breed was by the French naturalist Buffon in the 17th century. The breed was largely decimated during the first World War and wild populations were not seen after World War Two. A concerted effort by European breeders kept the breed from extinction. The first Chartreux were brought to the USA in 1971 by Helen and John Gammon of La Jolla, California. There are fewer than two dozen active Chartreux breeders in North America as of 2007.

|'''(1) Korat (Thailand)''' || '''(a) Goes limp when picked up.'''
|-

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Veda,chat-adulte-mâle-race-korat.JPG|'''1-c''' Korat, whose name in Thai means &quot;Good Fortune&quot;
Image:Ragdoll Blue Colourpoint.jpg|'''2-a''' Ragdoll cat, so name because it goes limp when picked up
Image:Sokoke_dalili.jpg|'''3-b''' Sokoke cats originated in Kenya
&lt;/gallery&gt;
====Korat====
The Korat is one of the oldest stable breeds of cat. Originating in Thailand, it is named after the Nakhon Ratchasima province, although in Thailand it is often known as Si-Sawat, which means '''good fortune'''. In fact they are often known colloquially as the &quot;Good Luck Cat&quot; and are given in pairs to newlyweds or people of high esteem as a wish for good luck.

The first known written mention of the Korat was in &quot;The Cat-Book Poems&quot; authored between 1350 and 1767 AD in Thailand, now preserved in the National library in Bangkok. They first appeared in America in the 1950s and arrived in Britain from there in 1972.

Korats are a shorthair with a small to medium build and a low percentage of body fat; their bodies are often described as semi-cobby, and are surprisingly heavy for their size. They are an active cat and form strong bonds with people.

Korats have several characteristics that together distinguish them as a breed:
* Korats are one of a few breeds that have only one colour.
* Jean Johnson first introduced Korats to the US in 1959. She had lived in Thailand, where she first encountered the breed. Her first pair were named Nara (male) and Dara (female).
====Ragdoll====
The Ragdoll is a breed of medium longhaired cat. It is best known for its docile and placid temperament and affectionate nature. They are non-aggressive to the point that many cats cannot or should not be let outside for prolonged periods as many will not defend themselves and most do not hunt. The name &quot;Ragdoll&quot; derived from the fact that many of these cats go completely limp and relax when picked up. Ragdolls have a sturdy body, short legs, and a thick coat with Siamese-style points.
====Sokoke====
The original name of the breed was Khadzonzos. The Khadzonzos cats were discovered in the Arabuko-Sokoke forest, on the Kenyan coast, by Jeni Slater in 1978. Gloria Moeldrop, a friend of Slater's, brought some of the cats home with her to Denmark to breed. In 1990, she imported more cats from Kenya to strengthen the breeding stock. The cats were first shown in Copenhagen in 1984. The breed was officially recognized by the FIFe in 1993, with the name changed to Sokoke, after the place from whence they came.

Sokokes have blotched tabby coats in shades of brown, with amber to light green eyes. Their coats are short and coarse, with little to no undercoat. Their bodies are long and thin, with long legs. The back legs should be longer than the front legs, similar to an ocelot. Sokokes are very active and enjoy climbing and &quot;talking&quot; to their people.

===d. The Scottish Fold breed dates back to 1961. True or False: This cat acquired its name because it folds its body up to stay warm.===
[[Image:Scottish Fold.jpg|thumb|Scottish Fold]]
False.

The Scottish Fold is a breed of cat with a natural mutation to its ears. The ear cartilage contains a fold so the ears bend forward and down towards the front of their head.

The original Scottish Fold was a long-haired white-haired barn cat named Susie, who was found at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland in 1961. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with folded ears, and one of the siblings was acquired by William Ross, a neighboring farmer and cat-fancier. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in Great Britain and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of geneticist Pat Turner. The breeding program produced 76 kittens in the first three years - 42 with folded ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple dominant gene. If one parent provides the gene for straight ears, and one parent provides the gene for folded ears, the kittens will be Folds.

The breed was not accepted for showing in Great Britain and Europe as it was felt that they would be extremely prone to ear problems such as infection, mites and deafness, but the folds were exported to America and the breed continued to be established there using crosses with British Shorthair and the American Shorthair.

Scottish Folds can be either long or short-haired, and they may have any coat color combination except for Siamese-style points. Pointed Folds have been bred but they are not eligible for showing. The original cats only had one fold in their ears, but due to selective breeding they have increased the fold to a double or triple crease that causes the ear to lie totally flat against the head. Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears or with normal ears, are typically good-natured and placid, and are known for sleeping on their backs. They tend to become very attached to their human caregivers and are by nature quite affectionate. Scottish Folds typically have soft voices and display a complex repertoire of meows and purrs not found in better-known breeds.

There is one medical problem that has been found to be related to Scottish Fold breeding. If both parents have folded ears, their kittens will be extremely prone to developing a painful degenerative joint disease that fuses the tail, ankles and knees. This condition also affects Scottish folds with one copy of the fold gene, to a lesser degree, and is the reason the breed is not accepted by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy and the Fédération Internationale Féline.

===e. One breed was developed from a type of cat which once roamed the streets of Singapore. Now called the Singapura, it is also known by which one of the following names?&lt;br&gt;(1) Drain cat&lt;br&gt;(2) Fat cat&lt;br&gt;(3) Flying cat===
[[Image:Raffles_singapura_cat.jpg|thumb|Singapura, also known as the Drain Cat]]
The Singapura is also known as the '''Drain Cat'''.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;

===f. The names of breeds do not always reflect their countries of origin. For example, the Nebelung (German for &quot;creature of the mist&quot;) breed was developed in the USA. True or False: The Poodle cat was developed in Germany.===
True.

The Poodle Cat was developed in Starnberg, Germany by a Scottish Fold breeder named Rosemarie Wolf.  It is a cross between a Scottish Fold and a Devon Rex.

===g. The English are renowned cat fanciers. Which one of the following is not a breed of domestic cat developed in the UK?&lt;br&gt;(1) Abyssinian cat&lt;br&gt;(2) Havana Brown cat&lt;br&gt;(3) Geoffroy's cat===

====Geoffroy's cat====
[[Image:Salzkatze.jpg|thumb|Geoffroy's cat]]
Geoffroy's cat is not a breed of domestic cat developed in the UK.  In fact, it is not a domestic cat at all!  Geoffroy's Cat (Leopardus geoffroyi) is probably the most common wild cat in South America. It is about the size of a domestic cat. Its fur has black spots, but the background color varies from region to region; in the north, a brownish yellow coat is most common. Farther south, its coat are grayish. 

Geoffroy's Cat primarily preys on rodents, small lizards, insects, and occasionally frogs and fish; it is at the top of the food chain. Although it appears to be plentiful, some conservationists are concerned because Geoffroy's Cat is hunted extensively for its pelt.

Geoffroy's Cat weighs only about 4-8 pounds and has a long tail and long legs. There have been attempts to breed this cat with domestic cats, but with very little success. Pregnant females appear to take extra care in choosing where they give birth to their kittens. Geoffroy's Cat kittens develop very quickly and at about 6 weeks they are fully mobile.

The species inhabits the Andes, Pampas (scrubby forest parts), and Gran Chaco landscape.

====Abyssinian ====
The Abyssinian is a natural breed of domesticated cat believed to originate from one Egyptian female kitten called Zula that was taken from a port in Alexandria, Egypt, by a British soldier and brought to England.

====Havana Brown====
The Havana Brown, also known as the Swiss Mountain cat, is a breed of cat well known and shown in England in the 1890s. Similar to the oriental shorthair, full color cats, also known as non-blue eyed siamese, were known to interbreed with the pointed cats of siam.

During World War I and World War II, the breeding programs of pedigreed cats suffered. It was not until the post World War II era that time cat fanciers renewed their breeding efforts. In the early 1950s a group of English cat fanciers began working together to restore the breed.

===h. Developed in the USA, the Ocicat is a wild-looking feline with spotted fur. True or False: it is illegal to keep the Ocicat as a house pet in most countries.===
[[Image:Ocicat-sitting.jpg|thumb|Ocicat, legal everywhere]]

False.

The Ocicat is a new and still-rare breed of cat which has spots resembling a 'wild' cat and the temperament of a domestic animal, named for its resemblance to the ocelot.

Despite its appearance, there is no 'wild' DNA in the Ocicat's gene pool. The species is actually a mixture of Siamese and Abyssinian, and later American Shorthairs (silver tabbies) were added to the mix and gave the breed their silver colour, bone structure and distinct markings.

The first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly, of Berkley, Michigan, who attempted to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. The first generation of kittens appeared Abyssinian, but the surprising result in the second generation was a spotted kitten, Tonga, nicknamed an 'ocicat' by the breeder's daughter. Tonga was neutered and sold as a pet, but further breedings of his parents produced more spotted kittens, and became the base of a separate Ocicat breeding program. Other breeders joined in and used the same recipe, Siamese &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; Aby, and offspring &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; Siamese. Today the ocicat is found all around the world, popular for its temperament but wild appearance.

Ocicats are a very outgoing breed. They are often considered to have the spirit of a dog-in a cat's body. Most can easily be trained to fetch, walk on a leash and harness, come when called, speak, sit, lie down on command and a large array of other dog-related tricks. Some even take readily to the water. Ocicats are also very friendly. They will typically march straight up to strangers and announce that they'd like to be petted. This makes them great family pets, and most can also get along well with animals of other species. Ocicats make excellent pets for people who want to spend a lot of time with their cat, but they do require more attention than cats who aren't so people-oriented.

There are twelve colors approved for the ocicat breed. Tawny, chocolate and cinnamon, their dilutes, blue, lavender and fawn, and all of them with silver: black silver (ebony silver), chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lavender silver and fawn silver.

===i. Originally called the Spotted Mist, this Australian breed's name was changed when some were born with tabby-patterned coats. What is its new name?&lt;br&gt;(1) Australian Mist&lt;br&gt;(2) Dingo cat&lt;br&gt;(3) Spotted and/or Marbled Mist===
The Australian Mist (formerly known as the Spotted Mist) is a breed of cat that was developed in Australia in the late 1970s, hence its name. The breed was developed by crossing the Burmese, Abyssinian, and Domestic shorthair cats to create a shorthaired cat with a spotted coat. The name was changed from 'Spotted Mist' to 'Australian Mist' in 1998 when cats with marbled coats, rather than spots, were accepted as part of the breed.

Australian Mists are medium-sized shorthaired cats, with a round head and large, expressive eyes. The coat patterns have three levels of definition; (1) ground color, paler than pattern; (2) pattern, delicate though distinct from ground color; (3) appears to wear a misted veil, caused by random ticking in the solid colour areas. The legs and tail are ringed or barred, and the face and neck also have delicate lines of color. Australian Mist cats come in seven colors: brown, blue, chocolate, lilac, caramel, gold and peach.

As a relatively new breed, all Australian Mist catteries are in Australia, however desexed cats have been introduced to America and several other countries. The breed is now accepted for Championship status by the World Cat Federation.

===j. The Japanese Bobtail cat originated in China centuries ago. True or False: It is the only breed of domestic cat with virtually no tail.===
[[Image:Japanese Bobtail walking.JPG|thumbnail|180px|A Japanese Bobtail cat, with the short tail clearly visible]]
False.

The Japanese Bobtail is a breed of cat with an unusual 'bobbed' tail more closely resembling the tail of a rabbit than that of an ordinary feline. The short tail is caused by the expression of a recessive gene. Thus, so long as both parents are bobtails, all kittens born to a litter will have bobtails as well. Unlike the Manx and other cat breeds, where genetic disorders are common to tailless or stumpy-tails, no such problem exists with the Japanese Bobtail.

The Japanese Bobtail is a small domestic cat native to Japan and Southeast Asia. The breed has been known in Japan for centuries, and there are many legends and myths, as well as pieces of ancient art, featuring it.

Japanese bobtails may have almost any color, but &quot;Mi-ke&quot; or bi-colors are especially favored by the Japanese. Much like any other breed, the colors may be arranged in any number of patterns, with van and calico being common among purebred cats, and tabby being seen in non-purebred Japanese bobtails

==3. Keep a cat for at least six months and do one of the following:==
===a. If you currently have a cat, keep a record of the care for you cat for one month. Include in your record when it is watered and fed and how often and with what supplies you care for the liter box. Why should your cat not be allowed to roam the neighborhood free?=== 
Veterinarians commonly recommend commercial cat foods that are formulated to address the specific nutritional requirements of cats although an increasing number of owners are opting for home-prepared cooked or raw diets.

Although cats are obligate carnivores, vegetarian and vegan cat food are preferred by owners uncomfortable with feeding animal products to their pets. The US FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine has come out against vegetarian cat and dog food for health reasons.

Cats can be selective eaters. Although it is extremely rare for a cat to deliberately starve itself to the point of injury, in obese cats, the sudden loss of weight can cause a fatal condition called Feline Hepatic Lipidosis, a liver dysfunction which causes pathological loss of appetite and reinforces the starvation, which can lead to death within as little as 48 hours.

Pica is a condition in which animals chew or eat unusual things such as fabric, plastic or wool. In cats, this is mostly harmless as they do not digest most of it, but can be fatal or require surgical removal if a large amount of foreign material is ingested (for example, an entire sock). It tends to occur more often in Burmese, Oriental, Siamese and breeds with these in their ancestry.

Some houseplants are harmful to cats. For example, the leaves of the Easter Lily can cause permanent and life-threatening kidney damage to cats, and Philodendron are also poisonous to cats. The Cat Fanciers' Association has a full list of plants harmful to cats.

Paracetamol or acetaminophen (trade name Panadol and Tylenol) is extremely toxic to cats, and should not be given to them under any circumstances. Cats lack the necessary glucuronyl transferase enzymes to safely break paracetamol down and minute portions of a normal tablet for humans may prove fatal. Initial symptoms include vomiting, salivation and discolouration of the tongue and gums. After around two days, liver damage is evident, typically giving rise to jaundice. Unlike an overdose in humans, it is rarely liver damage that is the cause of death, instead methaemoglobin formation and the production of Heinz bodies in red blood cells inhibit oxygen transport by the blood, causing asphyxiation. Effective treatment is occasionally possible for small doses, but must be extremely rapid.

The following symptoms require urgent veterinary attention: Straining non-productively, breathing through the mouth, difficulty breathing, gums that are white or blue, fitting for longer than one minute, collapse. You should also take your cat to the vets urgently if it has been involved in a road traffic accident, fallen from a height, eaten anything poisonous or has been exposed to smoke. There are many other symptoms for which a cat requires veterinary attention.

If your cat has been declawed it should ''never'' be allowed outside without a leash.  A declawed cat is defenseless.  Not only will it not be able to strike back at another animal threatening it, it will also not be able to climb a tree to make an escape.  

If your female cat has not been spayed , it should not be allowed outside when it comes into estrus or it may become pregnant (kittens, cute as they are, are sometimes difficult to find good homes for).  

Un-neutered male cats should likewise not be allowed to roam, because they too will contribute to the problem of unwanted kittens.

===b. If you do not currently have a cat but you owned one at sometime in the past for at least 6 months, take care of someone else's cat for at least one week. Record the care that was required and explain the relationship of house cats on the environment and why it is best they not be allowed to become feral.===
See the answers to part ''a'' above to refresh your memory on caring for cats.  The owner will likely provide food for the cat, and it is best to feed it what it is used to.

Cats should not become feral because they tend to overbreed, creating ever-larger populations of feral cats.  Feral cats can become a nuisance and cannot be approached by humans.  Often 

Feral cats may live alone but are usually found in large groups called feral colonies. The average life span of a feral cat that survives beyond kittenhood is usually cited as being less than two years, while a domestic housecat lives an average of 12 to 16 years. 

Cities, Australia, and North America are not native environments for cats. The domestic cat comes from temperate or hot, dry climates and was distributed throughout the world by humans. Cats are extremely adaptable, and feral felines have been found in conditions of extreme cold and heat. They are more susceptible to cold, damp conditions than to cold alone. In addition, they are vulnerable to predators such as dogs, feral pigs, wolves, bears, cougars, bobcats, foxes, crocodilians, birds of prey, and coyotes.

Feral cats are often apex predators in local ecosystems, and their predation on small mammals and birds, particularly endangered ground-nesting birds, is of increasing concern. There is little doubt that feral cats are extremely effective at controlling or even eradicating small animal populations, and some cite[citation needed] the utility of cats in controlling populations of verminous rodent species. This is one of the major justifications for the keeping of farm cats. However, conservationists argue that feral cats contribute greatly to the killing of songbirds and other endangered birds, with estimates that bird loss is at 100 million a year due to predation.

Numerous Australian environmentalists and conservationists claim that the feral cat has been an ecological disaster in Australia, inhabiting most ecosystems except dense rainforest, and being implicated in the extinction of several marsupial and placental mammal species.

In the United States, there is debate about how to deal with feral cat populations - many municipalities make it legal to kill them and classify them as vermin or pests. Some advocate culling feral cat populations by hunting, arguing that it is the most cost-effective method of population control.

Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) programs are facilitated by many volunteers and organizations in the United States. These organizations trap feral cats, sterilize them through neutering before releasing them. Variations of the program may include inoculation against rabies and other viruses and sometimes long-lasting flea treatments. Frequently, attending veterinarians cut the tip off one ear during spay/neuter surgery to mark the individual as being previously caught. Volunteers often continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Many animal care experts believe that it is prohibitively difficult if not often impossible to domesticate and adopt a feral cat unless it is trapped and socialized before six weeks of age.

===c. Participate in a cat related project of your choice in support of a local humane society or similar organization.===
In many countries the term ''humane society''  is used mostly for societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals (SPCA's).

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) is any of a number of animal welfare organizations whose operations include protecting and providing shelter to animals in danger. The SPCAs are non-profit organizations that campaign for animal welfare and take in abused or abandoned animals, and help them to get adopted. See:

# Does your place have a well? 你們的地方有沒有井？
# The well at our place is not like the well at your place. The wells here are all made of bricks, and the shallowest are only one zhang (3.3m) deep. The wells here are carved from stone, and the shallowest aren't even a zhang deep, at most seven or eight inches. 我們那裡的井不像這裡的井，這裡的井都是用磚砌成的，最淺的有一丈深。我們那裡的井是用石髑砌的，最淺的不及一丈，最多七八尺深。
# When we draw water there, the women all carry water bottles on their heads, each drawing water from the ladle at the end of the rope, drawing water the same as they draw water here. 我們那裡運水時，全是婦人把瓦盆頂在頭上，各自在汲水的瓢上都栓著細繩子，像這裡打水一樣的打水。
# How do they draw water? 怎麼那樣打水呢？
# 自古以來就是這樣啊！
# 你把這馬牽回去，再牽別的來飲水。
# 都飲完了。
# 噯喲！這樣昏黑的地方到那裡去出恭呢？
# 我們到後山去出恭如何？
# 我拿著馬在這裡，你去吧！
# 我暫且不出恭，你不要在路旁出恭，明天被別人看見了，恐怕要罵唷！
# 我們一人各牽兩匹去，牢牢的栓好吧！
# 這槽院很寬，栓的遠一點，恐怕繩子扭結在一起。
# 拿草豆來拌著給牠們飽飽地吃，我們去睡吧！
# 伙伴們起來吧！雞叫了三遍了，天快亮了，我們趕快整理行李，在套了馬鞍的工夫，天就亮了吧！
# 現在整理完了，去見主人家吧！
# 主人家阿哥不要抱怨我們蹧踏，我們要走了。 
# 我為什麼抱怨擬們，你們若不抱怨就好了。 
# 如果不以為招待不好，回來時還請來我的店住宿。 
# 我昨天說的就是這樣走過的橋，比以前好多了，舊橋拆了，現在都鋪了新板子，而且所用的樑柱也比以前牢多了，幾十年不會壞。 
# 太陽這樣高了，前面又沒有店，我們到那村子去換米做飯吃了走吧！ 
# 就那樣吧！肚子很餓了。 
# 把這馬的行李都卸下來，鬆一鬆肚帶，解下嚼子，留下一個伙伴放在路旁看著馬吃草吧！我們都進入這村去問米吧！ 
# 主人家阿哥，我們是行路的人，直到現宰還沒吃早飯，因前頭沒有店子，特意來相求，換些米做飯吃。 
# 還換什麼米呢？我們的飯熟了，客人吃了過去吧！ 
# 若是這樣也使得，但你做的飯很少吧！ 
# 不要緊，若少時再做也使得。
# 把棹子放下，請客人們在這草棚底下坐下吃飯吧！ 
# 雖然是淡飯，請吃飽吧！
# 孩子們若有熟菜，端些來給客人們吃，沒有的話，如有蘿蔔、生蔥、茄子就拿來吧！
# 再沒有別的菜，只有醃鹹的鹹瓜，給客人們吃吧！ 
# 小人才初次見面，就蒙受阿哥的恩點給飯吃，怎麼敢反倒埋怨呢？ 
# 都會 嗎？ 
# 像這樣的淡飯有什麼費事，我也不出外走嗎？出外走時也和你們一樣啊！ 
# 阿哥你說的話很對，出外走熟者看客重，喜好喝酒者惜醉人。
# 除你之外還有伙伴嗎？
# 有一位伙伴看行李放馬。
# 若是那樣讓他挨餓嗎？
# 我們吃了後帶一點去給他，若有碗，請給一個吧！ 
# 從這裡盛出一碗帶給那位伙伴吧！ 
# 你們酌量都吃吧！我家裡飯很多，你們吃了後再另外盛了帶去吧！你們不要客氣，慢慢的吃飽肚子吧！ 
# 我們既已吃了，還有什麼客氣之處呢？ 
# 吃飽了嗎？
# 我們很飽了，收拾碗碟吧！
# 那一位看馬的伙伴到現在還沒吃飯，孩子們你們另外盛飯和湯跟著客人去，看著那位伙伴吃完收拾器皿帶回來吧！
# 太打擾主人了。
# 並沒有好吃的。只請吃了一頓淡飯，有什麼打擾之處？ 
# 餓時吃一口，強如飽時得米一斗，我們正飢渴時，阿哥眷愛給飯吃，實在感激不忘。
# 我若出外時，能頂著房子走嗎？也要投人家去尋飯吃，俗話說敬客千里，傳名萬里。
# 主人家阿哥，小人們來此只顧打擾，姓也不曾問，阿哥你貴姓？ 
# 我姓張，這是張社長家，阿哥既然問了我的姓，也告訴我貴姓吧！ 
# 我姓王。
# 你住在那裡？
# 我住在遼東城內。
# 阿哥若有事到我們那裡去時，如果不嫌棄小人的話，務請到我家裡來。 
# 我若不去就罷了，倘若前往時，有不去找你家看你的道理嗎？ 
# 我方纔到那村子去換米，遇到非常好的人，他請我們吃他自已做的現成飯，還打發人另外給你送來，你趕緊吃了把碗碟交給小孩帶回去吧！ 
# 伙伴你把馬趕來馱上行李，我們馱載的工夫，他也吃完了飯。
# 噯喲！這匹馬為什麼這樣難拿？
# 原來就這樣啊！倘若仍然這樣壞時，以後還要絆著，我以前常絆著，今天忘了絆，我們大家一起包圍吧！
# 啊！好容易拿住了。
# 阿哥你把碗碟帶回家去吧！ 
# 你們看，多麼快天又晚了，從這裡到夏店還有十里路，前往時已到不了。
# 去投路北那人家找個住宿地方吧！
# 且慢，倘若我們一齊蜂擁而去時，那家的人一定嫌人多不肯讓我們住宿，你們兩人留在這裡看行李，我們兩個去問吧！
# 給主人阿哥行禮。
# 你們是做什麼的人？
# 我們是行路的客人，今日天晚了，來府上找個住宿的地方。
# 我們的房子窄，沒有別人住宿的地方，你們到別的地方尋找住宿的地方吧！ 
# 怎麼辦呢？阿哥我們是行路的人，認得誰呢？就是你的炕沒有空位不讓我們住宿吧，這門前的車房裡讓我們住宿一夜如何？
# 我不是不讓你們住宿，只是部院於每家門牆粘貼禁令，面生可疑之人不讓他住宿。你們是那裡的人，又不是原來認識的朋友，怎麼不分好壞讓你們住宿呢？ 
# 主人家阿哥，我們不是壞人，小人住在遼東城內，你若是不信時，看看拿來蓋印的證件，不會錯。 
# 你住在遼東城內什麼地方呢？
# 小人住在遼東城內樓閣北街東邊。
# 離樓閣有多遠？
# 你帶這馬和葛布到京城去賣了之後，還要買些什麼貨物帶回朝鮮地方去賣？ 
# 那雜貨舖是你的嗎？
# 是。
# 面對南邊隔著兩家開酒店姓劉的人是我的朋友，你認識嗎？
# 他是我的鄰居怎麼會不知道？ 
# 聽了你的話，雖然並無可疑之處，但房子委實狹窄，不能住宿怎麼辦呢？
# 阿哥你可憐我們一點吧！現在是日落天黑的時候，要我們到那裡去找尋住處呢？好也罷壞也罷，只讓我們住一夜吧！
# 這些客人為什麼這樣胡鬧，現在部院對各村莊偏僻地方都遍頒禁令不得容留面生的人，你雖說是遼東人，我不能相信，察看你們各位伙伴的模樣語調，也不是漢人，也不是滿人，不知道是做什麼的人，我怎麼敢留你們住宿呢？近來有一個人家，讓各位客人住宿，那些客人內因為有一個逃走的滿人，部院把流住的人家一齊來調查，因此人都怕被牽連，豈敢容留平城一點兒也不知道的人啊！
# 主人家好生固執，好人壞人還會錯嗎？這幾位伙伴都是朝鮮人，他們來時守渡口的官司禁亂比這裡還嚴，這些人來時一個一個仔細盤問了才放行。他們若是亂人來歷不明時怎麼到此地來，他攜帶證件從朝鮮趕馬往北京去做買賣，他雖然不會說漢語，但委實並不是亂人。
# 若是這樣就行了，不要爭執，後炕狹窄，老少又多，不能住在一處你不嫌冷的話，在這車房住宿如何？
# 只要得到住宿的地方就罷了啊！還嫌什麼冷？

# 大阿哥我們直到現在還每吃晚飯，不但肚子餓不能入睡，而且這騎的馬若挨餓ㄧ夜，明天怎麼騎行呢？反正也沒有一個客人求兩個主人的理，你既已愛顧我們留我們住宿，換給一頓飯的米和馬的草豆如何？
# 我們這裡今年下天因為天旱，秋季又淹大水，田穀一點未收，所以我們也是換著吃以維持身命尚且不夠，又那裡有多餘的米給人換呢？
# 我們很瞭解阿哥的話，但是我們在黎明時吃了飯直到日落一天行走疲乏很餓，把你換來的米勻一點給我們吧！
# 說來你們是從遠地來的客人，按裡講這錢不該要，但因今年稻轂收成不好，一百個錢換一斗，我本來沒有剩餘的米，客人你們既一再央求，所以給你們三升，你們布要嫌少，暫且做一頓稀飯吃飽吧！
# 客人們不要埋怨，今年委實糧荒，若是像往年豐收時，不僅你們二三人，就是十多位客人也都給吃。
# 你說得是，我也聽說今年這裡田穀非常欠收。
# 我如到這後房去做稀飯，黑夜裡出入不便，你家的狗又兇惡，你替我做稀飯如何？
# 是，你們幾位客人收拾這車房住的地方，我送稀飯來給你們吃。
# 若是這樣，多謝。
# 主人阿哥，還有一句話，人雖有一點吃的，但這馬怎麼辨呢？給些草豆如何？
# 人吃的尚且沒有，那裡有馬的草豆呢？我們房子後面有一塊很好的羊草，你吃了飯後到那裡去放牧時諒可吃飽肚子吧！現成的不餵，白費錢買草豆做什麼呢？
# 若是這樣就聽從阿哥的話，我到車房去，我們兩個留在這裡看守行李，派他暪兩個去放馬，到半夜以後我們兩個去替換他們，讓他們回來睡吧！如此明天可不至於打瞌睡。
# 這稀飯碗匙都帶來了，你們各自盛了吃吧！
# 現在吃完了飯，我們兩個先去睡，你們兩個先去放馬，倒了半夜時去替尼們。
# 我剛才睡了一覺起來一看，參星升高已是半夜了我先去替換他們來睡，你隨後來，我們兩個看馬吧！
# 若是這樣，你去吧！
# 噯喲！你們兩個累了啊，趕緊去睡吧，到那裡時叫那位伙伴趕緊來吧！
# 尼來了，把馬趕來收放在一處這樣時容易照管，今夜黑暗，各自失散時，眈誤我們走路。
# 明星已高了，天快亮了，把馬趕回住宿的房子，收拾行李時天必亮了，把馬拴起來，叫那二位伙伴起來吧！
# 你們兩個趕快起來收拾行李，好好的檢查，不要錯拿了主人的東西。
# 行李都馱好了，去見主人家道謝後再出發吧！
# 阿哥我們昨天來無緣無故太打擾你們了。
# 我全沒能照故你們又說什麼打擾呢？
# 我們去夏店時，買飯吃了在傍晚時進京城，從這裡到夏店有幾里路？
# 有三十多里路。
# 你昨天說過十幾里路，今天為什麼說三十里路呢？
# 我昨天記錯了，今天才想起來了。
# 我們不要歇息，趁涼快走吧！
# 那眼前看到的黑林就是夏店啊，從這裡到那裡還有七八里路，你從前是到北京走熟的人，而現在怎麼忘了呢？
# 我好多年沒走了，所以忘了。
# 快到店了，我們吃十麼好呢？
# 我們是朝鮮人，不慣吃稀麵，吃乾的如何？
# 我們買燒餅炒肉吃完過去吧！
# 在這裡拴了馬，卸下行李，到賣食物的店去吧！
# 先送一碗熱水來，我洗臉吧！
# 客人你洗了臉後，告訴我吃十麼，我先頊備吧！
# 給我們四人買來三十個錢的羊肉，二十個錢的燒餅。
# 湯的味道有一點淡，若有鹽拿來吧，我們自已調了吃。
# 這燒餅一半冷一半熱，把熱的暫且擱下吃，這涼的你拿夸爐裡烤了拿來。
# 我們飯也吃了，算給了錢走吧。
# 主人家你來，我們剛才吃了燒餅二十個錢，羊肉三十個錢，這裡一共五十個錢你點了收下吧！
# 我們馱行李走吧，因為日正當中非常熱了，今早吃了乾的，所以有點渴。
# 離這裡不遠前面有一家茅草蓋的店舖，到那裡後喝幾杯酒解渴，讓牲口歇息一會兒再走。
# 賣酒的人到這裡來給我們盛值二十個錢的酒來吧！
# 這酒的味道好嗎？
# 我壞我的話不可靠，不管如何，你嚐嚐看，若是酒不好時，我一個錢也不要，就喝吧！
# 若有好菜，拿些來吧！
# 有醃的王瓜，現在就送來。
# 客人你喝熱的嗎？喝涼的嗎？
# 你不要溫，觔天天熱，我們都渴了，喝涼的好。
# 大哥以我看，這裡面歲數沒有比你大的，你先喝注一杯吧！
# 豈敢，小人我今年才三十五歲，想來還有比我歲數大的吧，那敢就接受喝呢？
# 這樣的話還是阿哥你的歲數大，我今年才三十二歲，比你小三歲啊！
# 小人雖然年紀大，斷不可首先接受喝，怎麼說呢，這次沿途一齊來，託各位伙伴的福，諸事沒給我麻煩，我一點沒辛勞之處，今天這酒是我買來給大家喝的，我怎麼可以先喝呢？
# 是，是，阿哥既然這樣費心，我們不要再推讓，趕緊一齊喝了快點走吧！
# 賣酒的人來了，算錢給他吧！
# 這是五分銀子，你找給我六厘銀子吧！
# 大哥給些好銀子吧，這銀子很平常，怎麼使用呢？
# 這銀子那一點不好，你看什麼不能用，你若不認識銀子時，叫別人看吧！
# 為什麼叫別人看，拿到兌錢的地方去照市上的價換得就行了，你就另外換給五分好銀子吧！
# 何用與他吵鬧，這個賣酒的人很好爭，像這樣的銀子怎麼說不可用，這是今早吃飯的地方剩下的銀子啊，若果真不好，他會要嗎？
# 算了吧，反正我將就接受了這幾個錢，就是都不給也罷。
# 我也沒讓你多損失，若為了這一點小事，你一句我一句口角，別人聽了會恥笑啊！
# 太陽過了中午了，這裡離城有五里路，留兩位在後頭慢慢地趕牲口來，我帶一位伙伴先去找個好店住宿，再來接你們，我們既曾先商定到順城門官店店去住宿，就到那裡去找，你們隨後快來吧！

      <text xml:space="preserve">The square root of 2 is irrational, &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q} &lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
Assume for the sake of contradiction that &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q} &lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b} &lt;/math&gt; holds for some ''a'' and ''b'' that are coprime.

This implies that &lt;math&gt;2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;. Rewriting this gives &lt;math&gt;2b^2 = a^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the left-hand side of the equation is divisible by 2, then so must the right-hand side, i.e., &lt;math&gt;2 | a^2 &lt;/math&gt;.
Since 2 is prime, we must have that &lt;math&gt;2 | a &lt;/math&gt;.

So we may substitute ''a'' with &lt;math&gt;2A&lt;/math&gt;, and we have that &lt;math&gt;2b^2 = 4A^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Dividing both sides with 2 yields  &lt;math&gt;b^2 = 2A^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and using similar arguments as above, we conclude that  &lt;math&gt;2 | b &lt;/math&gt;. However, we assumed that &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b} &lt;/math&gt; such that that ''a'' and ''b'' were coprime, and have now found that &lt;math&gt;2 | a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 | b &lt;/math&gt;; a contradiction.

Therefore, the assumption was false, and &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; cannot be written as a rational number. Hence, it is irrational.

==Another Proof==
The following reductio ad absurdum argument is less well-known. It uses the additional information √2 &gt; 1.
#Assume that √2 is a rational number. This would mean that there exist integers ''m'' and ''n'' with ''n'' ≠ 0 such that ''m''/''n'' = √2.
#Then √2 can also be written as an irreducible fraction ''m''/''n'' with ''positive'' integers, because √2 &gt; 0.
#Then &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}\cdot n(\sqrt{2}-1)}{n(\sqrt{2}-1)} = \frac{2n-\sqrt{2}n}{\sqrt{2}n-n} = \frac{2n-m}{m-n}&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}n=m&lt;/math&gt;.
#Since √2 &gt; 1, it follows that ''m'' &gt; ''n'', which in turn implies that ''m'' &gt; 2''n'' – ''m''.
#So the fraction ''m''/''n'' for √2, which according to (2) is already in lowest terms, is represented by (3) in strictly lower terms. This is a contradiction, so the assumption that √2 is rational must be false. 

Similarly, assume an isosceles right triangle whose leg and hypotenuse have respective integer lengths ''n'' and ''m''.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the ratio ''m''/''n'' equals √2.  It is possible to construct by a classic compass and straightedge construction a smaller isosceles right triangle whose leg and hypotenuse have respective lengths ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n'' and 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''m''.  That construction proves the irrationality of √2 by the kind of method that was employed by ancient Greek geometers.

== Notes ==
* As a generalization one can show that the square root of every prime number is irrational.
* Another way to prove the same result is to show that &lt;math&gt;x^2-2&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible polynomial in the field of rationals using Eisenstein's criterion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Pythagorean trigonometric identity is a trigonometric identity expressing the Pythagorean theorem in terms of trigonometric functions.  Along with the sum-of-angles formulae it is the basic relation among the ''sin'' and ''cos'' functions from which all others may be derived.

==Statement of the identity==
Mathematically, the Pythagorean identity states:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1.\qquad\qquad (1) \!&lt;/math&gt;
(Note that {{nowrap|sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''x''}} means {{nowrap|(sin ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.)

Two more Pythagorean trigonometric identities can be identified.  They are derived as follows. 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\sin^2 x}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x}&amp;=\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} &amp; \qquad\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos^2 x}&amp;=\frac{1}{\cos^2 x}\\
1 + \cot^2 x &amp;=\csc^2 x &amp; \tan^2 x + 1 &amp;=\sec^2 x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Like (1), they also have simple geometric interpretations as instances of the Pythagorean theorem.

==Proofs and their relationships to the Pythagorean theorem==
===Using right-angled triangles===
Using the elementary &quot;definition&quot; of the trigonometric functions in terms of the sides of a right triangle,

:&lt;math&gt;\sin x = \frac{\mathrm{opposite}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos x = \frac{\mathrm{adjacent}}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}}&lt;/math&gt;

the theorem follows by squaring both and adding; the left-hand side of the identity then becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{opposite}^2 + \mathrm{adjacent}^2}{\mathrm{hypotenuse}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which by the Pythagorean theorem is equal to 1.  Note, however, that this definition is only valid for angles between 0 and &amp;frac12;''&amp;pi;'' radians (not inclusive) and therefore this argument does not prove the identity for all angles. Values of 0 and &amp;frac12;''&amp;pi;'' are trivially proven by direct evaluation of sin and cos at those angles.

To complete the proof, the identities of Trigonometric symmetry, shifts, and periodicity must be employed. By the periodicity identities we can say if the formula is true for -''&amp;pi;'' &lt; x ≤ ''&amp;pi;'' then it is true for all real x. Next we prove the range &amp;frac12;''&amp;pi;''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''&amp;pi;'', to do this we let ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;frac12;''&amp;pi;'', t will now be in the range 0 &lt; x ≤ &amp;frac12;''&amp;pi;''. We can then make use of squared versions of some basic shift identites (squaring conveniently removes the minus signs).

: &lt;math&gt;\sin^2x+\cos^2x \equiv \sin^2\left(t+\frac{1}{2}\pi\right) + \cos^2\left(t+\frac{1}{2}\pi\right) \equiv \cos^2t+\sin^2t \equiv 1.&lt;/math&gt;

All that remains is to prove it for &amp;minus;&amp;pi;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0; this can be done by squaring the symmetry identities to get

: &lt;math&gt;\sin^2x\equiv\sin^2(-x)\mbox{ and }\cos^2x\equiv\cos^2(-x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Using the unit circle===
If the trigonometric functions are defined in terms of the unit circle, the proof is immediate: given an angle θ, there is a unique point ''P'' on the unit circle centered at the origin in the Euclidean plane at an angle θ from the ''x''-axis, and {{nowrap|cos θ}}, {{nowrap|sin θ}} are respectively the ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates of ''P''.  By definition of the unit circle, the sum of the squares of these coordinates is 1, whence the identity.

The relationship to the Pythagorean theorem is through the fact that the unit circle is actually defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 = 1\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the ''x''- and ''y''-axes are perpendicular, this fact is actually equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem for triangles with hypotenuse of length 1 (which is in turn equivalent to the full Pythagorean theorem by applying a similar-triangles argument). 

===Using power series===
The trigonometric functions may also be defined using power series, namely (for ''x'' an angle measured in radians):

:&lt;math&gt;\sin x = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n + 1)!} x^{2n + 1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos x = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the formal multiplication law for power series we obtain

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\sin^2 x\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \sum_{j = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^i}{(2i + 1)!} \frac{(-1)^j}{(2j + 1)!} x^{(2i + 1) + (2j + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left(\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} \frac{(-1)^{n - 1}}{(2i + 1)!(2(n - i - 1) + 1)!}\right) x^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} {2n \choose 2i + 1} \right) \frac{(-1)^{n - 1}}{(2n)!} x^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\cos^2 x\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{i = 0}^\infty \sum_{j = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^i}{(2i)!} \frac{(-1)^j}{(2j)!} x^{(2i) + (2j)}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left(\sum_{i = 0}^n \frac{(-1)^n}{(2i)!(2(n - i))!}\right) x^{2n}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \sum_{i = 0}^n {2n \choose 2i} \right) \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note that in the expression for &lt;math&gt;\sin^2&lt;/math&gt;, ''n'' must be at least ''1'', while in the expression for &lt;math&gt;\cos^2&lt;/math&gt;, the constant term is equal to ''1''.  The remaining terms of their sum are (with common factors removed)

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i = 0}^n {2n \choose 2i} - \sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} {2n \choose 2i + 1}
= \sum_{j = 0}^{2n} (-1)^j {2n \choose j}
= (1 - 1)^{2n}
= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

by the binomial theorem.  The Pythagorean theorem is not closely related to the Pythagorean identity when the trigonometric functions are defined in this way; instead, in combination with the theorem, the identity now shows that these power series parameterize the unit circle, which we used in the previous section.  Note that this definition actually constructs the ''sin'' and ''cos'' functions in a rigorous fashion and proves that they are differentiable, so that in fact it subsumes the previous two.

===Using the differential equation===
It is possible to define the sin and cos functions as the two unique solutions to the differential equation

::&lt;math&gt;y'' + y = 0&lt;/math&gt;

satisfying respectively &lt;math&gt;y(0) = 0, y'(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y(0) = 1, y'(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  It follows from the theory of ordinary differential equations that the former solution, sin, has the latter, cos, as its derivative, and it follows from this that the derivative of cos is &amp;minus;sin.  To prove the Pythagorean identity it suffices to show that the function

:&lt;math&gt;z = \sin^2 x + \cos^2 x&lt;/math&gt;

is constant and equal to 1.  However, differentiating it and applying the two facts just mentioned we see that &lt;math&gt;z' = 0&lt;/math&gt; so ''z'' is constant, and &lt;math&gt;z(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

This form of the identity likewise has no direct connection with the Pythagorean theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

'''Béarnaise sauce''' is an egg-yolk and butter emulsion in the [[Cookbook:Hollandaise|Hollandaise]] family of sauces. 

'''Ingredients'''

* 30 mL (2 tablespoons) tarragon [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 30 mL (2 tablespoons) sherry wine vinegar (or dry white [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]])
* 1 [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolks]]
* 75 - 100 g (1/3 - 1/2 cup) 3 - 4 oz melted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (warm but not hot)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne pepper]] to taste
* 1 tablespoon fresh chopped [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]]
* 1 tablespoon fresh chopped [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]

'''Preparation'''

1. Put the vinegars and finely chopped shallot and herbs in a small saucepan; simmer until reduced to 1 tablespoon. This is the flavorful glaze. Strain and set aside to cool.

2. Add the egg yolks and whisk until the ribbon stage with a balloon whisk.

3. Place the bowl over a pan of hot water (a double boiler) and continue whisking. Gradually add the softened butter, whisking until the sauce thickens and all the butter has been added.

4. Season and serve.

'''Notes'''

* Do not use dried tarragon, if you cannot find fresh tarragon, use a sprig from the vinegar bottle.
* To find the right temperature to emulsify the egg mixture and the butter, the bowl should be just hot enough so that you can still touch it. If you cannot hold the bowl it is too hot. Be forewarned that this trick may not always work depending on a multitude of conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Output==
Before you learn more about Pascal it is important to know how to actually do something. For now, we will use console input and output. Here is an example of how output is done:
&lt;source lang=&quot;pascal&quot;&gt;
program output;
begin
  writeln(1);
  write('1');
end.
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;code&gt;writeln()&lt;/code&gt; displays what ever is in the parentheses and prints a &quot;new line character&quot;, making newly displayed characters start on the next line.

&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; is simply grammatical; it just separates the two statements.

&lt;code&gt;write()&lt;/code&gt; displays what ever is in the parentheses without printing a &quot;new line character&quot;.

Do note that characters and strings must be placed within single quotation marks. You may have noticed that &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;writeln&lt;/code&gt; work for more than one type. You may also wonder how &lt;code&gt;write(1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write('1')&lt;/code&gt; could do the same thing yet, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'1'&lt;/code&gt; be represented in completely different ways. Like wise, how &lt;code&gt;49&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'1'&lt;/code&gt; may be represented the same way yet, &lt;code&gt;write(49)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write('1')&lt;/code&gt; don't do the same thing. The answer is that compiler always knows the type and thus how it's formatted.


  readln;
end.
&lt;/source&gt;
As you notice, the parentheses are not required when no parameters are present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Choosing a first tree is an important step in learning the art of bonsai.  Many would-be bonsai growers become disillusioned after trying, and failing, to keep their first tree alive.  In the case of &quot;mallsai&quot;, the bonsai-like specimens sold at malls and big box stores, the tree may even be dead before it gets home!

==Consider your environment==

In nature, tree species adapt to their natural habitat over thousands or millions of years.  In bonsai, we choose species that fit well with the environment we want to keep them in.  Most common bonsai species, including virtually all trees native to temperate climates, must be kept outdoors in order to get enough light and experience seasonal changes in light and temperature.  If you plan to keep your bonsai indoors, you must choose among the tropical species that can survive at household temperatures all year around.  Even then, tropical bonsai may suffer from insufficient light.  If you have space to keep bonsai outdoors, there are viable bonsai species suited to any climate, and with appropriate winter protection many temperate species can thrive in most temperate climates.

==Bigger is better==
[[Image:Japanese White Pine, 1625-2007.jpg|thumb|This ancient Japanese White Pine, in training since 1625, survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.]]

Beginners have a tendency to start small: tiny trees in tiny pots.  Unfortunately, these are the most difficult to care for.  The best trees for beginners are larger specimens.  One hot dry summer day may be enough to kill a tiny juniper in a mame pot, while a medium juniper in a 2 gallon nursery pot might survive weeks, even months of neglect as long as it rains every once in a while.  A big, healthy pine bonsai in a three foot pot can weather anything short of a chainsaw.

I note that over the past eight months, you have been making a number of edits to the Muggles' Guide. We do appreciate the fresh viewpoint. I hope you won't think too harshly of me if I step in here and there and clean up the grammar a bit...

I would appreciate it if you could sign up for an account. I mean, it's so much simpler to refer to you by name, rather than as &quot;you know, the IP address who stops by every month or so...&quot; Thank you very much.

Here are some containment laws&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald&amp;Jones 1998, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contents of any container must be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crates contain only packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packages contain only raw material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liners contain only packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drums contain only pucks and liners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pucks contain only one liner of non-liquor material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Semantic Web Ontology Language==
There is a very good overview of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language OWL] which is publicly avaiiable.

==Protégé-OWL==

For practical work we suggest the [http://protege.stanford.edu/overview/protege-owl.html Protégé-OWL] editor.

==Semantic Web Rule Language==

A very brief overview of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web_Rule_Language SWRL] is available.

DL stands for Description Logic.

==Why not OWL?==
In this Wikibook we will focus on OWL-DL.
Anyone is free to use either OWL-Lite or OWL-Full.
But OWL-DL does require some explanation!

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is about [[w:Zope_3|Zope 3]], a [[w:Python_Programming|Python]] framework for web application development.  Zope 3 was developed by the Zope community with the leadership of Jim Fulton, the creator of [[w:Zope|original Zope]].  Zope 3 consists of a number of small frameworks and libraries written in Python programming language and it is usable in pieces or in whole.  These frameworks and libraries can be put together to build any kind of web application.  Most of of the Zope 3 packages are built on top of a [http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/ComponentArchitecture component architecture] which helps to separate presentation code from the problem domain code and to create reusable components.

The goal for this project is to create a complete, free, open-content, well-organized book for Zope 3.  The target audience of this book are Python programmers looking for developing web applications.  However, the book  doesn't assume you are familiar with any other web framework.  This book will require prior knowledge Python programming language and at least some exposure to the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

From the buildout.zope.org site: ''Buildout is a system for managing development buildouts. While often identified as a Zope project, and indeed licensed under the ZPL by Zope creator Jim Fulton, buildout is useful for configurations beyond Zope, and even, in rare cases, a few that have nothing to do with Python.''

*Open css-lr300-rig.exp.
*Go to File&gt;Save as.
*Save it as ''css-lr300-idle.exp''
*Maximize the ''User'' viewport.
*The camera is hidden in the scene. To unhide it, open the Scene Explorer. (You should know how to do this by now.)
*Select ''Camera_Root'' and press '''H'''.
*Expand ''Camera_Root'' and press '''H''' on ''Camera'' and ''Camera_Interest''.
*Select ''Camera'' and press '''Shift+Ctrl+R'''. This will produce the same effect as clicking ''Transform'' and clicking ''Reset All Transforms''.
*Select ''Camera_Root'' and ''Camera_Interest'' and reset all of their transforms.
*Select ''Camera_Interest'' and translate it arbitrarily across the positive Z axis.
*Double click ''Camera'' in the Scene Explorer.
*Under ''Projection'', click Perspective.
*Under ''Field of View'' change the ''Angle'' value to 75.
{{Info|Every SMD format animation starts at frame 0.}}
*Set the starting frame to zero in the scene. Look at the bottom of the screen for a bunch of vertical lines with numbers at certain intervals. Click anywhere on it and drag it all the way to the left. This will set the current frame to number one using the red marker. Near the left you should see the number 1. Change this to the number 0. Now drag the red marker to frame zero.
*Open the Scene Explorer.
*Right click ''Camera_Root''
*Open the scene's schematic view by pressing '''9'''.
*Find the camera that is selected. It should be white with two gray rectangles underneath it.
*Hold '''SHIFT''' and drag a rectangle around the three rectangles.
*Close the schematic view.
*Press the following key sequence: '''VKCK'''.
**V is a shortcut for accessing object(s) translation. Its equivalent is pressing the letter ''t'' under the ''Transform'' panel on the right hand side of the screen.
**K is a shortcut to set a key for object(s). Its equivalent is pressing the button that looks like a key on the bottom right of the screen.
**C is a shortcut for accessing object(s) rotation. Its equivalent is pressing the letter ''r'' under the ''Transform'' panel on the right hand side of the screen.
*Press the '''ESCAPE''' key.
*Press '''H''' to hide the camera and its children.
*To view the camera, change any viewport to Cameras&gt;Camera. To access Cameras&gt;Camera, click the colored bar at the top of the viewport.
*If you accidentally move the camera, just move the frame marker around and it will reset back to its position.
*Save the scene. Now you should be able to change any viewport to whatever you want it to be.

{{Warning|The camera is not a reliable method of finding out how your model will look when it is compiled and used in-game. It is used to avoid the trouble of compiling as you can offset the scene later.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, I am a bureaucrat at the English Wikibooks. You had registered the username Jocke Pirat, but have made
*0 edits, and
*0 log entries.

Since you are inactive at Wikibooks, we are considering giving your username to someone else who uses that username on other wikis. To do this, we will change your username to Jocke Pirat (usurped). If you return to Wikibooks you are of course welcome to change your username again to just about anything you like. We do this to allow active users to have the same username on all the wikis we operate.

If you do not want us to change your username, please respond within 7 days of this email, and we will discuss possible compromises.

==Knots==
I have developed a lot of material on Knots for use in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Knot Tying]].  Much of it is somewhat modular, with each module being transcluded in the Knot Tying chapter, and many other chapters as well.  If you think it would be useful, we could move the knots themselves out of the AYHAB book and into a more generic place - then we could transclude them wherever they are needed.  Transclusion is done like this:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Knot/Bowline}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

which produces this:
{{:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Knot/Bowline}}
I'd be happy to help, but I might not be able to spend much time on it until next week.

:This really needs to incorporate ''how-to'' information on the knots, which is not permitted at Wikipedia, but is required here. Please add instructions on how to tie each knot, what they are useful for, what they are not to be used for, and what kinds of rope they are for/not for (if applicable - it doesn't matter for some knots). You may also wish to include history of the knot if it is known and interesting. Currently, this consists of links to Wikipedia and two sections of real content.
:I would further suggest that the scope be expanded considerably to include as many useful knots as possible - there is no shortage of good knots to include in the book. It may also be worthwhile to take images during the process of tying the knots, upload them to [[commons:|Commons]] and use them here (or you could even do a video!) to better illustrate the module and teach the reader. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:34, 19 August 2008 (UTC)
== Simplified list of knots ==

thanks for your willingness to cooperate and your work at wikibooks.
However, my article is about a simplified list of knots so I don't think we'll be able to merge it together. We can however link to each other. I however do suggest you change the title to something more generic as Knot tying, as you suggested earlier. The article deserves it as it is already of high quality. I also suggest to link it from the wikipedia Knot-page (as I did aswell).

Let me now when you changed the title, so I (or you) may put the link on our articles.
Thanks,
[[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 15:04, 19 August 2008 (UTC)
: I was not proposing a merge, but rather that we could share common material.  The AYHAB book has a specific purpose and the material there is presented in a specific order for a specific reason.  However, the knots within are modular.  I'll see about moving them to a generic location sometime next week (unless I forget). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:24, 19 August 2008 (UTC)
::That's exactly what I was looking for aswell. I added some new books from my website and there is already something we can share. Your adventist clothing page (Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Camping/Clothing) is the only page showing up from a search conducted at wikipedia's &quot;clothing&quot; article. So I added a link to one of my clothing designs (I hope thats OK). [[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 07:30, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
:::I've updated my links and designs as they needed to be moved to wikiversity. See wikipedia colloquim for my latest gems ;-)

::I also found another book: called the Self-Reliance handbook; this book and its category may also be combined with your AYHAB-book. In fact, I think that your AYHAB may be morphed to the main Scouting Handbook (by changing the name) and that the self-reliance handbook may be linked from this. [[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 08:12, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
::: AYHAB is laid out according to the official requirements specified by the Pathfinder organization.  Scouting merit badges have ''different'' requirements in a ''different'' order, and the badges have ''different'' names.  We do have a book on Scouting Merit Badges (I do not recall the name), and they are free to incorporate any of the AYHAB material that they see fit, but these books should absolutely not be merged, nor should AYHAB be renamed.  It was written for a specific purpose and is being widely used in the intended capacity.  That said, the material could be shared by modularizing sections and doing transclusions, but IMO, Scouting would be better off using subst to grab a snapshot of AYHAB material and then it could be edited to meet some other purpose. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:31, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
::: OK, a small suggestion still; perhaps celestial navigation (on the stars; and not just the pole star but all of the star navigation points such as they did in sailing in the old days) can be still implemented. Also, navigation on the sun (using a stick for exact north-south determination) is useful.
::::Celestial navigation involving more than Polaris is well beyond the scope of a Pathfinder honor.  Pathfinders is geared for youth between the ages of 10 and 16.  I am pretty familiar with all of the honors offered by the organization, and to my knowledge, none of them require celestial navigation (other than the use of Polaris).  However, the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Wilderness Living|Wilderness Living]] honor requires knowledge of two methods to determine direction without a compass.  It already details one method using the sun and a stick, but if you would like to expand that answer, you are certainly welcome to do so.  As I've previously stated, the curriculum is set by a formal body - the Pathfinder organization.  Neither I, nor any other Wikibooks editor has the authority to alter the official requirements.  If we alter the Wikibook to add new requirements or edit the existing ones, the book will fail to be a reliable reflection of the official honor requirements.  The book's purpose it to help instructors teach the official requirements.  Going beyond that exceeds its scope and compromises its mission. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:52, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

::Just to note, I've done a bit of work here. What was there previously was really not booklike, so I've expanded the scope, created some structure, and imported some content for the introduction chapter. However, we will still need how-tos for all the knots, so I'll probably come grab some content from &quot;your&quot; book &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:46, 19 August 2008 (UTC)
::: I've seen you've already quite expanded the article, thanks for that. However please insert info that a simplified list of knots includes no more than 8. At the modules, the knots are placed under each other and it already looks that way more knots need to be learned (you eg included reef knot, bowline, ...) Aldough the latter knots are indeed useful, they are only required at special circumstances and the average knot-tyer does not &quot;really&quot; need to learn them. Thus please re-insert this info on what the 'main knots&quot; are. [[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 07:30, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
:::: Hey KVDP.  I think it would be a good idea to have the first section (or second if you count the introduction) be a list of the basic knots.  The rest could follow.  ''You'' should feel free to add it in yourself - there is no need to get someone else to do it. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:56, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
:::::If you want to keep a section for &quot;the most important knots&quot; (I think this is a bad idea) then you can easily transclude those pages onto [[Knots/Most useful]] or something. However, the previous structure was really ''not'' booklike. While you're not obligated to use the structure I've laid out, I think it is logical, reasonably complete, and will be educational once content is filled in. I encourage you to tweak as you see fit, but I recommend that you do not limit the scope to &quot;a simplified list of knots&quot;. Not only is that not really a textbook, but it is also not very useful. Additionally, your choice of knots is rather strange - the bowline for example is among the most useful knots in existence, and deserves inclusion in any text on knots. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:56, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
::::::I added the list in the article as Jomegat suggested. However Mike, do you still have a review of my previous list of knots page (in the pages history it isnt there anymore). I would like to see whether I included all info from my previous page.[[User:KVDP|KVDP]] ([[User talk:KVDP|talk]]) 19:15, 23 August 2008 (UTC)

One other point.  At Wikibooks we do not have &quot;articles,&quot; we have &quot;books.&quot;  This, I think, is the basis of Mike's objection.  A &quot;Simplified list of knots&quot; is more of an article, but what Mike has done is laid out like a book (and since this is Wiki'''books''' that is fitting and proper). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:35, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
::I agree with what you are saying, yet I would still like to mention that writing an article about this is also not possible because how-to info is off limits at wikipedia. That's why i put it here. Note the dilemma ... ;)
:::Please note that Wikibooks is for open-source collaboratively-edited textbooks, not Wikipedia's rejected content. If it doesn't fit at Wikipedia, that doesn't automatically mean it fits here - we have an [[WB:WIW|inclusion policy]] too! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:19, 21 August 2008 (UTC)

==Modules to create==
*[[w:Double overhand knot]]
**The double overhand knot is the knot used as the main stopper knot, when the knot is not required to be opened again afterwards. It is a fast knot (when you don't want to spend allot of time on it to fasten something), and still is a somewhat better than the more regular &quot;half knot&quot; or bloodknot. The knot can also be used to tie two ropes together when you still want the knot to be removed afterwards. This can make the use of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure-of-eight_knot Flemish eight] no longer required.

*[[w:Reef knot]]

*[[w:Double sheet bend]]
**The double sheet bend is a knot used to tie 2 ropes together which you still want to seperate afterwards. Also, it can be used to pull up or drag something by means of a rope (if the binding rope is looped around the object and attached to the second rope by this knot). If the second rope cannot be put into a double sheet bend, a regular reef knot can be used instead.

*[[w:Round turn and two half-hitches]]

*[[w:bowline]]

*[[w:Two half-hitches]]
The double half hitch is the basic knot to be used as a hitch. Hitches are eg used to bridge a gap and bind a rope eg to a pole from a distance. It can not slip and is thus fairly easy to throw. If the endknot is loosened, it may be used as a slippable knot (eg to bind stuff together by simply pulling the main rope (which can thus be done from a distance; similar to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline bowline]).

*[[w:Diagonal lashing]]

*[[w:Round lashing]]
**Diagonal and round lashing is to be used to bind two crossed poles together (eg to make rafts, barricades, fences, platforms, ...). Both diagonal and round lashing need to be learned as there will be situations which require the first or the second.

::Perhaps a division is to be made when attaching a rope to a fixed object under pressure and not under pressure. In the first case, the [[Rolling hitch]] ([http://www.realknots.com/knots/hitches.htm clove hitch variant]) may be used, in the second case the round turn and 2 half hitches could be used.

Right now, this book can only be an example of a &quot;developing book&quot; as described in the third sentence of that item.  A finished wikibook doesn't, for example, use logical categories to organize its contents, nor go about listing its contents by transcluding Special:PrefixIndex.

I believe (optimistically perhaps, but there it is) that this is a difficulty of form rather than substance.  It ''should'' be fixable without losing anything from the current structure.  If there's a plan already in place to gradually de-encyclopedize this book, well and good, and sorry to be a bother.  If not, I'll be happy to apply myself to the question and try to suggest strategy and tactics for the purpose &amp;mdash; though it will probably be a few days, at least (i.e., if not more), before I have time to thoroughly study the existing structure and come up with suggestions.

BTW, it's a reflection of book structure that subpages of a Wikibook should be categorized only via {{tlx|BookCat}}.  There are two modes of {{tlx|BookCat}}, flat filing (the default) and deep filing (via {{tlx|BookCat|2=filing=deep}}).  Flat filing just puts everything into the book category.  Deep filing puts pages into subcategories that follow the fields of the page name &amp;mdash; which makes sense ''because'' a book has an outline, and the page name fields can be expected to follow that outline.  For example, {{nowrap|[[Knots/Hitch knots/Icicle hitch]]}} would flat file into [[:Category:Knots]], and deep file into {{nowrap|[[:Category:Knots/Hitch knots]]}}.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 04:23, 2 September 2010 (UTC)

:Hmmm... What would you suggest? I don't see the harm in categories that don't correspond to page names personally; the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]] uses many, many more categories, for instance. I don't know whether this will ever be a finished book, actually. As for the deep filing, I wouldn't mind, but note that it would duplicate the tables of contents in the general subcategories (eg. [[Knots/Bend knots]]). —'''[[User:Internoob|Internoob]]''' ([[User talk:Internoob|Disc]]·[[Special:Contributions/Internoob|Cont]]·[[wikt:User:Internoob|Wikt]]) 00:13, 3 September 2010 (UTC)</text>

Grammar changes are when a part of the grammar of a language changes over time, so that the language now has a different way of accomplishing the same thing.
For example, when French evolved from Latin it did not have a fixed word order, while it now does; much information that in Latin was conveyed by use of case, is conveyed by word order in modern French.
*parva mensa rufa non est.
*la petite table n'est pas rouge.
*the little table isn't red.

Grammar changes may take place in a variety of ways:
*Sound changes

== New Title Policy - Revisited ==

I think that the current new title policy is stifling the growth of Wikijunior. I would like to see us add more titles and grow Wikijunior a little more quickly. I'm not sure if I know the perfect recipe but each time we launch a book, we get new contributors with an interest in working on it. My idea is this. Instead of launching a single new book quarterly, we launch a new book whenever there is enough support. 

One way of doing this would be to check the voting at the beginning of each month. If any of the titles has 5 or more votes from users with more than 20 edits, the leading vote-getter will launch. Voting will start over and the next month the leading vote-getter will launch. If no title has 5 or more votes, there is no title launch that month and votes continue to accrue until the next month, or the following month. 

Some of the advantages of this proposal: 
*allows us to potentially launch 12 books a year instead of just 4.
*good book ideas can be launched faster. 
*sets a minimum interested contributor requirement. 
*more dynamic development environment may attract additional contributors. 

Does anyone else have an opinion? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:57, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

:I'm all in favour.  I don't like the current system as it deters editors who have to wait '''3 months''' before they can start their book. [[User:Xania|Xania]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:08, 18 June 2007 (UTC)

:Keep in mind that the original &quot;policy&quot; that was even enforced through page deletions was to have only the three &quot;standard&quot; Wikijunior books until one of them was published and available on Amazon.com.   I thought that was a silly policy on the whole, and there were many additional book ideas that would be appropriate for Wikijunior than were originally offered.  Still, the idea here is that we ought to strongly encourage new participants to work with existing content rather than creating hundreds or thousands of new book titles that simply sit undeveloped, such as is found on [[Wikibooks:Alphabetical classification]].

:On the whole, this title selection process has been rather successful, even though it has been subverted a few times in the sense that some participants here have simply gone on and created the Wikijunior title anyway without even going through the new book of the quarter process.  Some very amazing books have been written, including some content which has consistantly stayed at the leading edge of being some of the best of Wikimedia.

:The reason for only launching one book per quarter was to consider that the number of Wikijunior participants at the time the process was initiated was rather small, and it was thought that trying to put together a whole Wikijunior book in less than 3 months before the next cool project was started seemed a bit overwhelming.  Simply put, there weren't enough participants to justify a new book on a monthly basis.  The original intention was to change this to a monthly installment eventually as Wikijunior grew and more people could be found to sustain such a level of development.

:In fact, one of the original &quot;objectives&quot; of Wikijunior was to have enough content that we could set up a monthly periodical where kids would receive a new Wikijunior book each month in the mail from a Wikijunior content publishing house.  Somebody even went through the effort to register an ISSN number (like the ISBN, but for magazines).  The idea was to try and have enough content &quot;in the pipeline&quot; of development at various stages so volunteers wouldn't feel pressured to meet a hard deadline.  I don't know if this will ever be done, but it is certainly something to think about.

:My only concern about this current proposal to move to a monthly book topic is again due to the level of participation.  Even at the  current interval, the next book title to be displayed and worked on is only 10 days away (on July 1st), and will likely be World War II as the topic.  Due to the removal of the Wikijunior templates on the [[Main Page]], the new title vote or even [[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions]] page has lost quite a bit of the participation that it enjoyed previously.  I understand that this is a proposal to modify how this may be selected as well, giving a minimum threshold as well if there isn't that level of participation, but is a month enough time to get this book suggestion developed enough before we move on?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:28, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

::Some things that I have observed about how Wikijunior when we launch a book: 
::* We get new contributors who come to work specifically on that book. 
::* The rate of edits on the book is very high for the first few weeks and then goes into a steep decline eventually leveling off to a fairly constant low level of activity after a couple months. 
::* Activity on Wikijunior as a whole goes up. 

::I think that this revision in the new title policy is worth trying. I don't think we'll actually end up launching a book each  month (at least not right away). I do think we can give each book a good start in just a month. If you look at the history of book top pages and compare the state of the page after the first month with the state after three months, I think you'll find that there is usually little difference. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:53, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

== Building Awareness for Wikijunior and Wikibooks ==

I think Wikijunior is a very valuable resource, though it is under-resourced and certainly has room to grow. I have decided to &quot;be bold&quot; and become an advocate for Wikijunior in the Open Ed community and the broader educational technology arena (primarily K-12). I am hoping that over the next year or so this will result in more people joining the community and contributing.

One way to do this is to get Wikijunior books listed in some of the Open Ed repositories so that more people know about them. To move this ahead, I have started creating metadata for [http://www.oercommons.org OER Commons], which will then also feed into [http://learn.creativecommons.org/ ccLearn] and other sites. I am starting with the featured books that are educational in nature.

If you have any feedback on this, I'd love to hear it. Also if you know of a mature book  that is not currently &quot;featured&quot; or if you'd like to send me an abstract of any book you've worked on or are familiar with to include, that would be helpful too. 

Once this is further along and in OER Commons, I'll post an update.

:One of the things I believe is necessary is for a physical print version of some of the Wikijunior books to become available, that can be sold at more or less reasonable prices.  This is a very hard chicken-or-egg problem that is very difficult to crack, and something that is going to take a fairly sizable hunk of real cash... and something that simply must come from outside of the Wikimedia Foundation.  The WMF certainly is not interested in getting in the publishing business...especially after Brad Patrick pushed for the WMF as an ISP philosophy.  When the WMF was Jimbo's private plaything it was much more reasonable to consider a publishing group.

:It may also be useful to try and come up with a &quot;best of Wikijunior&quot; website.... where it can show some of the outstanding contributions that have been made over the years, but without the cruft that comes from the initial editing process due to the fact this is a Wiki.  This is an idea which has been discussed several times over the past several years, but is something that I think is overdue at the moment.  The problem with previous efforts to get this going was mainly a lack of communication with the major stakeholders, and the willingness to follow through.  The wikijunior.org domain is owned by the WMF, and this is perhaps something that can be expanded upon by a dedicated individual who wants to get something going.  I'll spell more out in another section on this talk page later.

:The main thing is trying to get either or both of these efforts going... and the problems here with Wikijunior really are a microcosm for Wikibooks as a whole as well.  I do believe that the K-6 market (more or less the primary target of the initial Wikijunior books) is an easier &quot;market&quot; to crack... particularly if we are not trying to make full textbooks but only supplementary materials.  Genuine textbooks may be a bit tougher nut to crack.

:The idea of advertising Wikijunior through educational websites is a good idea.... and I've seen Wikijunior mentioned a couple of times.  Posting links to well developed Wikibooks titles is IMHO the best sort of &quot;advertising&quot; that can happen, and seems to be where Wikibooks does the best as well.

:: I support the [http://xixtas-open.blogspot.com/2007/10/open-letter-to-wikimedia-foundation.html proposal] to establish a &quot;stable&quot; Wikijunior site.

:: Re: printed books, I'm not as convinced that is critical. Most schools I work with are much more interested in electronic books than print ones. However, if print books are a desirable outcome, there are many grants that would be relatively easy to secure. A more stable site and a strong partnership with the K-12 community would be essential though.

:::I think having printed books that people can buy inexpensively is a desirable goal, but I think that having stable versions online is a critical next step in the development of Wikijunior. Also, thanks for getting his together, Karen.

::::: I agree with the above user; having the books released in printed format isn't neccesarily a critical acheivement. While it would, perhaps, make it easier for schools without internet access to obtain the books, having the books available online will make it easier ''overall'' for most schools. Furthermore, if they wish to have a paper copy of the book, they will be responsible for printing costs, which I honestly don't believe will be a serious hardship on the part of a school, considering the fact that 1) wikijunior books aren't especially lengthy and 2) most schools already have equipment and money set aside for printing costs. (such as for worksheets, exams, etc) The only setback is that most schools do not have color printers intended for larger scale printing jobs, so self-printed wikijunior books would end up being black and white, unless the school specifically set aside money to have the books printed up properly. 

::::: In addition, e-books tend to be easier to search (ctrl+F !), can be viewed at home or at school, and if the books aren't printed out, a lot of trees can be saved ^_^

::::: I think that the printed books would be most useful, as I mentioned earlier, to those who do not have computers or internet access, such as poorer schools or schools in third world countries. --[[User:EnaamA|Winter]] ([[User talk:EnaamA|talk]]) 03:39, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

:::::: Okay, I completely take back what I said about the books not being lengthy. I just looked at the Big Cats one and it's just a *little* too much to be printing out... I made my previous comment thinking in terms of the book I last contributed to (Ancient Egypt), which wasn't very long. But still I think that having the books available as e-books is more important. At least for now, while the books aren't as well known. Maybe when the books are more widely used and a demand for them in printed format is generated , then it would be a good idea, but for now, I think that e-books are the way to go. --[[User:EnaamA|Winter]] ([[User talk:EnaamA|talk]]) 03:39, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

===Logos and mascot===
I think Wikijunior needs a logo like wikibooks has.  Maybe something that looks like a childrens book cover with multicolored text like the KIDS heading on the Wikijunior front page.  Colorful pictures are an important in childrens books.  Adding covers of books to front page would make it more kid-friendly.  Pictures and logo are good for marketing.  I'd like to be be able to add a link from my class web site to our Wikijunior book: Famous Inventors using a logo, so it would be nice if there was one. --[[User:Jsigler|Jsigler]] ([[User talk:Jsigler|talk]]) 03:52, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

== What's going on here? ==

I'm really interested in putting some significant time into some of the Wikijunior books. My only hesitation is that it seems as though there is very little activity here. What I'm wondering and trying to gain a sense of, is how many people are involved and how much work is being done with these projects. Some of the books need some significant work and refinement that I know I'm not capable of doing alone. I don't really want to put a lot of time into books that will never be finished.

== What's up? ==

A few concerns.  Where is the vote for the next book? The Wikijunior title page links to a vote dated June 2007 which makes us look like we've stopped updating the website.  It also looks a bit bad that the 'Wikijunior News' is dated November 2007 which also gives the impression that nothing is happening around here. In addition I'd like to add my Europe book to the little &quot;bookshelf&quot; image we have at the top of the page?  How can I do this quickly without the need for any paint programs?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:50, 10 April 2008 (UTC)

== separate project? ==

It is too different from other WikiBooks content. Wouldn't you request it to be become a separate project? --[[User:Eugrus|Eugrus]] ([[User talk:Eugrus|talk]]) 18:11, 14 June 2008 (UTC)
:Hi Eugrus, the prospect of wikijunior being a seperate project is something that has cropped up before, and there are people arguing both sides of the argument. As i see it, wikijunior's scope is very similar to that of wikibooks as a whole, and as such it belongs here. Yes it has a different audience, but the same criteria apply. More importantly however if wikibooks was moved to its own site, there would be fewer contributors to work on it, and at the minute wikijunior desperately needs more contributors. in the same light people would find it more dificult to locate the site's resources, with them no longer being on wikibooks. I hope this helps explain why thus far wikijunior has remained part of wikibooks. Perhaps in the future if wikijunior grows then a seperate project may be something that is pursued.

== Just a note ==

In case anyone working here was interested in the [[SchoolsWP:index:home|Schools Wikipedia]] which we are a few weeks from completing for 2008/9. It is jointly done between the [[wikimedia:Press_releases/SOSChildrenUK2007|Wikimedia Foundation]] and a [[SchoolsWP:SOSChildren|children's charity]] and is pretty successful in terms of having well over a million readers. It gets given away free to schools all over the place. The content is just Wikipedia content so the language is often complicated but it does have &quot;adult&quot; content removed, get selected around the schools curriculum and get checked for vandalism. AFAIK this is the only such project so perhaps we could do the clean up etc jointly with Wikijunior if there are people with time here? The overlap with non fiction projects for children is pretty striking so I hope no one minds the heads up.  --[[User:BozMo|BozMo]] ([[User talk:BozMo|talk]]) 20:55, 18 August 2008 (UTC)
== Suggestion ==

I'm unsure of where to suggest this, but how about some sort of non-English language book for young children, maybe as part of [[Wikijunior:Animal Alphabet]]? I've seen multiple books for young English-speaking children in which the alphabet of a different language is given, along with alphabet-book type pictures and words describing the pictures.

== Vandalism Warning ==

In light of the recent vandalism I thought about putting up a warning on the main page of Wikijunior. This warning should include nothing but commonly known facts about all Wikimedia projects. However, some readers and parents of readers might not be aware of these facts; thus, I think it is in the interest of everyone to state these facts as clearly as possible. My first draft is this:

{{Warning|'''Thank you for visiting Wikijunior! Wikijunior is currently part of Wikibooks, an open-content wiki project of the Wikimedia Foundation. As such it is vulnerable to vandalism, i.e., the malevolent inclusion of inappropriate or even illegal content. While the Wikibooks community tries hard to reduce vandalism to a minimum, there is a small chance that readers of Wikijunior will be exposed to vandalism. To reduce these chances, you are encouraged ''not'' to log in. Thank you for your understanding.'''}}

I think we should put such a warning message on the main page of Wikijunior as soon as possible. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:33, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

:Since there were no comments or objections, I included the warning on the main page. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:03, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
== Published book LANGUAGES ==

When I was in 7th grade -- back in the 1950s-- I got very facinated by languages and alphabets.  I think juniors who would look at this book need to know that one pronounces some languages reading from RIGHT to left, such as aramic, hebrew, sanscrit, etc., Some of the texts one is asked to pronounced, could be easily transcribed as they are memorizing the text.  How about including an appendix showing relations of some languages, such as those derived from Latin, etc.  Also an alphabet list, to show the similiar pronunciation of the individual letters, alph*, beth, gam* and so on.  Just a thought.  A R Taylor  (For the academics in the crowd, I have a doctorate in Education, a specialist in Instructional Systems, a Masters in Librarianship, etc.)

content for kids should be setup on different (sub)domain and no links to any other web that's not safe-for-kids, including any links to wikipedia.org, wikimedia.org, etc.

all these to prevent kids accidently open non-kids sites

== Three suggestions ==

Why not change the name of wikijunior to '''WiJi'''? It would definitely be more appealing to children. I think it sounds a lot better. Another suggestion would be to ditch the whole wikipedia template, its too boring. make one more appealing to children. My final suggestion is too allow for flash upload; this will allow interactive viewing for children,. Animation explains in a way no textbook can. It would be exclusive to wikipedia.

I agree with the boring layout.  Books for children need to be much more visual, rather than text-based.  The flash upload would help add point-and-click visual interaction.  Animation is one of the biggest strengths of web content over paper content.  
--[[User:Jsigler|Jsigler]] ([[User talk:Jsigler|talk]]) 02:28, 3 September 2009 (UTC)


I agree as well. If you ever watch kids go online, all of the websites they go on are colorful and animated.

:::One of the criteria for opening a new Wikimedia project is that it has to have a valid language code. Not being a real language Simple English has no language code, and thus new projects in that &quot;language&quot; will not be created. But if you're writing books for children, you should be using simple English already. It's not &quot;Simple English&quot;, but it is a simplified form of English. Just go ahead and write the book in simple English, or Simple English if that's what you want. It's still English, regardless of the name that's given to it.

== Put a formal end to voting ==

Since there hasn't been a vote since I left (more than 2 years ago) I think that we should remove all references to voting for titles from Wikijunior. Does anyone have any objections?

:This seems to me to be something not to move hastily on.  Some sort of standards are needed; if what is now called for isn't being followed, then some combination of adjusting rules and adjusting practices may be called for.  I seem to recall looking into what is proper procedure some time back (probably between one and two years ago) and finding somewhere an invitation to go ahead and create wikijunior books without a vote, but I ''think'' it was qualified (how, I'm not sure).  The first thing to do is, presumably, to assemble a list of what is said where about proper procedure.  I might be able to find time to do this sometime in the next week or so...

I agree (having spent a few days poking about) that references to voting should be removed from this page.  Further action may be called for thereafter, but there's no reason to hold off on removing the confusing and inaccurate claims about a nonexistent voting procedure.
:My vague recollection of an invitation to go ahead and create WJ books without a vote probably evolved from the following passage, which was written on 11&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;2007 by (wait for it) Xixtas, on [[meta:Wikijunior]], with edit summary &quot;Update to reflect the reality of the current state of the project.&quot;:
::The site is currently working towards completion of several books. There are 10 sanctioned titles under development along with several unsanctioned organic titles.
:For perspective on the rise and fall of voting and the New Title &quot;Policy&quot;, here are a few snapshots from the past:
:* August 2008: [[User_talk:Mike.lifeguard/Archive_21#Wikijunior|Discussion]] that led to the &quot;not used&quot; notices on {{nowrap|[[Wikijunior:New Title Suggestions]]}} and {{nowrap|[[Wikijunior:New Book Collaboration Vote/July 2007 Vote]]}}.  (The book in question, BTW, was {{nowrap|[[Wikijunior:American Founding Fathers]]}}.)
:* November 2005: [[Talk:Wikijunior/Archive_1#Quarterly voting for new Wikijunior Book Projects|Announcement of the quarterly voting process]].
:* October 2005: [[Wikijunior_talk:New Title Suggestions#What to do now?|Discussion to create the quarterly voting process]].

As for how to go on from here, a few stray thoughts:
* There do need to be some sort of standards for the placement of titles on the main page.  It's not entirely clear to me how the addition is now handled, and I suspect that it isn't.
* Any sort of consensus process for adding titles to the list(s) here should take place somewhere that a fair number of people will actually have on their watchlists; one can't build very much consensus by talking to oneself in an empty room.  The two possible venues that come to mind are this page &amp;mdash; but I'm not sure there are enough regulars here, in the sense of people who would not only notice a question here, but think of it as being addressed to them &amp;mdash; or {{nowrap|[[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]]}}.

I just gave the front page a bit of a [{{fullurl:Wikijunior|diff=1704259&amp;oldid=1704242}} face-lift]. For those concerned: I figured I'd comment on my changes here:

I replaced the picture which I felt was perhaps a bit bland. Wikijunior wants to be engaging so I chose a picture of a child immersed in a colourful pop-up book. It could really use some cropping, though.

I lightened the colours considerably. If we want to use strong colours, I suggest we widen the borders, but leave the background intact. I found the dark-blue in particular hard to read on.

I merged a couple of the table cells/boxes (the yellow and the orange). I felt they were on a similar enough of a topic: How to contribute to or discuss content. That left the featured books in a wide box below. I'm not too happy with the layout and I guess we could look at how to format the templates without messing up other pages.

Criticism welcome. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:29, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

:I like the new layout.

:I do have a couple of concerns about the new picture.  I find it visually difficult to parse.  Some of that would be alleviated by cropping; but some of it is cluttered central background, and some of it is that, even at full size, the fact that it's a pop-up book doesn't... leap out at you.  The old picture was visually simple, so that you knew instantly what you were looking at.  My other concern is that, once one does parse the new picture, the pop-up book suggests a more elementary level than most of the books here aspire to.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 02:56, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

:I'm game for a makeover. One thing right off the bat, I don't care for the new picture at all. IMO a pop up book sends the wrong message. But I'm inclined to leave it until we find something better. I darkened the background colors because the very light colors seem very bland to me. I believe they are still lighter than before. I believe wide borders are generally poor information design. I moved the search box above the titles because it didn't work for me sandwiched between the text talking about the titles and the links to them. -- [[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:43, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

::: I completely agree that the current picture is nowhere near optimal, but I prefer it over the old one and the one above because it makes it clear that these are not novels. Maybe I'm being silly and even encouraging a stereotype that educational books cannot be pure text or read in the sofa. What I ''do'' like about the current picture is that the boy is totally immersed in the book (much like the girl in the picture above). If you look more closely, you see that it's a pop-up book, but also that he actually seems to be reading &amp;mdash; not just being amused by the figures. A picture that shows children (preferably in the upper age-range) dug into obviously educational material is what I went looking for at commons. A picture of students discussing a book would also fit well into the ideas of constructivism and social constructivism.
::: Still, I'm not quite satisfied with the picture I chose. In the end the picture will hardly make or break the project. We could even play around with several; leaving them up for a while and seeing how we like it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 11:09, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

== Style guide ==

Knowing there was some sort of WJ style guide (that I hadn't looked at in ages) and wanting to consult it, but not being sure exactly what it was called (and being lazy, of course), I went to the WJ main page and... discovered there wasn't any link to it there.  So I've added one, and while I was at it I also created a shortcut, [[WJ:SG]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 17:27, 28 January 2010 (UTC)

== Wikijunior: World Heritage Sites ==

I have started developing a new Wikijunior title called [[User:Xania/Wikijunior:World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Sites]].  The idea is to present as many UNESCO sites as possible, in a simple manner with images, maps and brief details.  There are over 900 sites in the world so we can only cover some of these but I'd like to have a fair amount from each continent and different countries rather than just concentrate on North America and Europe.  The book is currently in my user space but I will move it across to Wikijunior after a few more pages have been started.  --[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:19, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
: Great to see another title being developed!

: Some considerations.
:* All Wikijunior books should be developed in &lt;code&gt;Wikijunior:&lt;/code&gt; space.
::*  Wikikjunior space is subject to flaggedrevs, and is configured (by admins) to show the latest sighted version by default instead of the current draft, to protect the young Wikijunior audience against malicious vandalism.  That can't be done on pages in user space, so we shouldn't be linking pages in user space as if they were part of Wikijunior.  So, you should move the pages to Wikijunior space and develop them there; some Wikijunior &lt;s&gt;pages&lt;/s&gt; books are very underdeveloped.
::* User space isn't fully in the public jurisdiction, so user pages shouldn't be presented as if they were part of the general wiki (for anyone to edit).
:* Only relatively complete books are listed on the Wikijunior main page.  Once the pages have been moved to Wikijunior space, list the book at [[WJ:All Books]].
: --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:31, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
: I've since moved the book to WJ space.  It would seem that Wikijunior space isn't automatically subject to flaggedrevs - I had to manually set each of the pages myself (I'm an admin) so that only reviewed edits were visible (or maybe that's because I started the book in my user space and later moved it to WJ?).  Since when have only relatively complete books been listed on the WJ main page?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:47, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
::It's been that way as long as I've known it.  We want to showcase the best of Wikijunior, and that doesn't include incomplete books. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 16:27, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
::: Re reconfig.  Yes, we have to do each page manually.  Back when we changed the flaggedrevs settings so the default is to show the current draft, we (mostly Adrignola and somewhat I) manually reconfigured every Wikijunior page (and Recent Runes, I think, later generated a list of all the Wikijunior pages we'd missed, which we then cleaned up &amp;mdash; iirc there were one or two dozen of them).  Since then, we try to monitor Wikijunior page creations, moves into Wikijunior space, and presumably likewise for templates with &quot;Wikijunior&quot; in their names, to catch and reconfigure pages as they arise.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 16:56, 20 August 2011 (UTC)

::: Re where to list.  It's been this way as long as I've known it, too.  Inspecting the current state of [[WJ:World Heritage Sites|the book]] more closely, I concur with Xania's rating of it as &quot;25%&quot; &amp;mdash; because &quot;00%&quot; would not acknowledge the infrastructural work that's been done.  A book with ''lots'' of pages might warrant listing on the main page when it's got a bunch of pages that are moderately developed, even though the whole is still at 25% (as is the case with [[WJ:The Elements]]); but that doesn't apply here.  My original skepticism about main-page listing was based on Xania's own remarks about level of completion; now that I've assessed it for myself, I'm willing to take a more definite stance: this isn't ready for main-page listing.  (Note, though, that [[WJ:All Books]] is meant to include all books, ''regardless'' of whether or not they're listed on the main page.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 18:31, 20 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Slipped Constrictor knot */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Constrictor knot''' is one of the most effective binding knots. Simple and secure, it is a harsh knot which can be difficult or impossible to untie once tightened. It is made similarly to a clove hitch but with one end passed under the other, forming an overhand knot under a riding turn. The '''Double constrictor knot''' is an even more robust variation having two riding turns. 

==Usage==
The Constrictor knot is appropriate for situations where secure temporary or semi-permanent binding is needed. Made with small-stuff it is especially effective, as the binding force is concentrated over a smaller area. Tied over soft material, such as the neck of a bag, use hard stiff cord. Tied over a hard surface, use soft stretchy line. The Constrictor knot's severe bite, which makes it so effective, can damage or disfigure items it is tied around. To exert extreme tension on the knot without injuring the hands fashion handles for the ends using Marlinespike hitches made around two rods.

Constrictor knots can be for used for temporarily binding the fibres of a rope or strand end together while splicing or when cutting to length and before properly whipping the ends. Constrictor knots can also be quite effective as improvised hose clamps or cable ties. Noted master-rigger Brion Toss says of the Constrictor, &quot;To know the knot is to constantly find uses for it....&quot;

==Tying==
The method shown below is the most basic way to tie the knot. Other methods exist which can be used to tied it in the hand or over the end of the object to be bound.
[[Image:Constrictor-ABOK-1249.jpg|thumb|800px]]
#Make a turn around the object and bring the working end back over the standing part.
#Continue around behind the object.
#Pass the working end over the standing part and then under the riding turn and standing part, forming an overhand knot under a riding turn.
#Be sure the ends emerge between the two turns as shown. Pull firmly on the ends to tighten.{{-}}
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:ConstrictorKnot HowTo.jpg
Image:ConstrictorKnot Final.jpg
Image:Constrictor clove.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Variations==
===Double constrictor knot===
If a stronger and even more secure knot is required an extra riding turn can be added to the basic knot to form a Double constrictor knot. It is particularly useful when tying the knot with very slippery twine, especially when waxed. Adding more than one extra riding turn does not add to its security and makes the knot more difficult to tighten evenly.
[[Image:Double-Constrictor-ABOK-1252.jpg|thumb|click for full size]]

#Make a turn around the object and bring the working end back over the standing part.
#Make a second turn following the same path as the first
#Pass the working end over the standing part, then under ''both'' riding turn and standing part, forming an overhand knot under two riding turns.
#Be sure the ends emerge between the turns as shown. The Double constrictor may require more careful dressing to distribute the tension throughout the knot. After working up fairly tight, pull firmly on the ends to finish.

===Slipped Constrictor knot===

This variation is useful if it is known beforehand that the constrictor will need to be released. Depending on the knotting material and how tightly it is cinched, the slipped form can still be very difficult to release.
[[Image:Slipped-Constrictor-ABOK-1250.jpg|thumb|click for full size]]
#Make a turn around the object and bring the working end back over the standing part.
#Continue around behind the object.
#Pass a [[Knots/Components|bight]] under the standing part and riding turn, instead of using the end itself.
#Be sure the bight and ends emerge between the two turns as shown. To release, tug on the working end so that the bight passes back through the knot.

== Releasing ==
[[Image:Constrictor-Releasing.jpg|thumb|Cutting the riding turn]]
A heavily tightened Constrictor knot will likely jam. If the ends are still long enough, it may be possible to untie by pulling one end generally parallel to the bound object and a bit up away from it, and prying it into the opposite end's part to open the knot. The use of a pick, marlinespike, or some other tool able to be forced between parts can help.

If the ends have been trimmed short, or the knot is otherwise hopelessly jammed, it can be easily released by cutting the riding turn with a sharp knife. The knot will spring apart as soon as the riding turn is cut. If care is taken not to cut too deeply, the underlying wraps will protect the bound object from being marred by the knife.

== Security ==
The Constrictor and Double Constrictor are both extremely secure when tied tightly around convex objects with cord scaled for the task at hand. If binding around a not fully convex, or square-edged, object arrange the knot so the overhand knot portion is stretched across a convex portion, or a corner, with the riding turn squarely on top of it. In situations where the object leaves gaps under the knot and there are no corners, it is possible to finish the Constrictor knot off with an additional overhand knot, in the fashion of a Reef knot, to help stabilize it. Those recommendations aside, Constrictor knots do function best on fully convex objects.

If an item, such as a temporarily whipped rope, is going to be cut very close to where a Constrictor binds it a Boa knot may remain more stable.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''binding''' knot is a knot that may be used to keep an object or multiple loose objects together, using a string or a rope that passes at least once around them.  There are various binding knots, divided into two types.

==Friction knots==
Friction knots are held in place by the [[w:friction|friction]] between the windings of line. Knotted-ends knots are held in place by the two ends of the line being knotted together.

==Whipping and seizing knots==
[[/Whipping/]] and [[/Seizing/]] serve a similar function to binding knots, but are classified differently since they contain many turns, like a lashing.

      <comment>/* Basic useful knots */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''knot''' is a method for fastening or securing linear material such as [[../Rope|rope]] by tying or interweaving.  It may consist of a length of one or more segments of rope, string, [[Knots/Webbing|webbing]], [[Knots/Natural fibre/Twine|twine]], [[Knots/Natural Fibre/Strap|strap]] or even chain interwoven so as to create in the line the ability to bind to itself or to some other object - the &quot;load&quot;.

==Usage==

There are a large variety of knots and each knot has specific properties and suitability for a range of tasks. Some knots are well-adapted to attach to particular objects such as another rope, cleat, ring, or stake.  Other knots are made to bind or constrict around an object.  Decorative knots usually bind to themselves to produce attractive patterns.  Choosing the correct knot for the job at hand is one of the most fundamental aspects of using knots well. However, if memory is limited, three of the most useful knots are the [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]], the [[Knots/Bend knots/Sheet bend|sheet bend]], and the [[Knots/Hitch knots/Clove hitch|clove hitch]].

===Learning===
The number of books, websites, videos, and other resources available to those interested in learning about knots is a testament to the value they hold for humankind.  While some people possess an innate ability to look at a diagram or photo and tie the illustrated knot, for others the initial stages of learning are best accomplished by being shown knot tying methods by a person who already knows them.  Knot tying skills are often transmitted by sailors, scouts, climbers, cavers, arborists, rescue professionals, fishermen, and surgeons. After mastering a few basic knots, the diagrams and photos become easier to interpret and use to continue the learning process.   As more knots are learned, patterns begin to become evident in their structure and methods of tying.  The learning of knots rewards practice and patience.

===Applications===

Knots are essential in many industrial, occupational, recreational, and domestic settings. Even simple activities such as running a load from the hardware store to home can result in disaster if a clumsy twist in a cord passes for a knot.  Truckers needing to tie down a load may use a [[Knots/Binding knots/trucker's hitch|trucker's hitch]], gaining mechanical advantage. Knots can save the spelunker from foolishly becoming buried under millions of tons of rock. Whatever the activity, such as sailing on the water or climbing on a cliff-side rock, learning well-tested knots prior to some hazardous activity introduces a critical measure of safety. In addition to safety, appropriate knots can prevent the necessity of cutting lines.

===Basic useful knots===
Some of the most useful everyday knots are the following. Most are both secure and easy to untie:
&lt;!--These links need to point to the knot's location in the book (ie catgorize the knots) --&gt;
*For tying a loop in the end of a rope, as around your waist or to secure a ring or grommet: the [[Knots/Loop knots/Bowline|bowline]]. 
*For tying the ends of two ropes together: the [[Knots/Bend knots/Sheet bend|sheet bend]] works well even with two different ropes. This is just as easy to tie but much more secure than the [[Knots/Binding knots/Reef knot|square knot]]. If one rope is much thicker than the other, a [[Knots/Bend knots/Sheet bend|double sheet bend]] is better. (Materials such as cables which are not easily tied may sometimes be joined by two interlocking bowlines instead.)
*The [[Knots/Bend knots/Fisherman's bend|fisherman's knot]] is similar but easier to tie with cold, wet hands.
*For flat material such as (seat)belts, the [[Knots/Bend knots/Water knot|water knot]] is best. (However, this is a poor knot for tying ropes.)
*For tying a rope to a pole, the [[Knots/Hitch knots/Buntline hitch|buntline hitch]]. A slipped variant is useful for quick release. If both ends of the line will be loaded, then the [[../Hitch knots/Clove hitch|clove hitch]] will suffice.
*On square posts where the clove hitch is not secure, [[../Hitch knots/Two half hitches|two half-hitches]] is good. It can be hard to untie, so the slipped variant may be useful.
*The [[../Hitch knots/Timber hitch|timber hitch]] works well on rough surfaces, including square timber, especially under constant strain, but isn't secure if the load jumps around. The [[../Hitch knots/Killick hitch|Killick hitch]] is a variant used for hoisting rocks and other odd shapes. 
*The [[../Hitch knots/Rolling hitch|rolling hitch]] is useful when you don't want a rope to slide up on down a pole, or when tying one rope to the middle of another.
*For a clothesline or other line that sags over time, the [[../Loop knots/Taut-line hitch|taut-line hitch]] can be ratcheted up to take out the slack.
*The [[../Binding knots/Trucker's hitch|trucker's hitch]] is useful for clinching down a load.
*The [[Knots/Seizing knots/Sheepshank|sheep shank]] is useful for taking slack out of the middle of a rope, but will only hold as long as there's strain on the rope. 
*The [[Knots/Binding knots/Constrictor|constrictor knot]] works well for making bundles or tying the neck of a sack. However, it is nearly impossible to untie once tightened, and will likely need to be cut with a knife. 
*The [[Knots/Loop knots/Alpine butterfly|alpine butterfly]] puts a secure loop in the middle of a rope when the ends aren't free.
*For climbing a rope, the [[../Hitch knots/Prusik hitch|Prusik knot]] allows you to make footholds out of loops of narrower rope which ratchet up the main rope. (The loop can be made by tying together the ends of a rope with a [[../Bend knots/Double fisherman's bend|double fisherman's knot]].)
*The [[../Hitch knots/Diamond hitch|diamond hitch]] works well for packing trail animals.
*The [[Knots/Stopper knots/Figure-eight knot|figure-of-eight knot]] stops the end of a rope from slipping through a hole or other tight spot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Chiffonade1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A demonstration of the chiffonade technique, using [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]] leaves]]
'''Chiffonade''' is a [[cooking]] technique in which herbs or [[Cookbook:Vegetable|leafy green vegetables]] (such as [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] and [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]]) are cut into long, thin strips.  This is generally accomplished by stacking leaves, rolling them tightly, then cutting across the rolled leaves with a sharp knife, producing fine ribbons.

To chiffonade, place a large stack of basil leaves in your fingertips, largest leaves at the bottom. Roll tightly and place down on a cutting board and cut thinly across, while keeping your knife tip in contact with the board at all times.

The term comes from the [[French language]]. It means &quot;made of rags&quot; referring to the fabric-like strips that result in this technique.

==Properties==
===Strength===
Knots invariably weaken the rope they are made in.  When knotted rope is strained to its breaking point, it almost always fails in or near the knot, unless it is defective or damaged elsewhere.  The bending, crushing, and chafing forces that hold a knot in place also unevenly stress the rope fibers and ultimately lead to the reduction of strength.  The exact mechanisms that cause the weakening and failure are complex and are the subject of continued study.

The relative knot strength, also called '''knot efficiency''', is the breaking strength of a knotted rope as a proportion of the breaking strength of the rope without the knot.  There are many difficulties in determining an overall numeric knot efficiency for a given knot.  This is due to the many factors that can affect the results of a knot efficiency test: the type of fiber, the style of rope, the size of rope, whether it is wet or dry, how the knot is dressed before loading, how rapidly the knot is loaded, whether the knot is repeatedly loaded, and so on.  With those limitations noted, most common knots have an efficiency between 40% and 80%.

While some [[Rope splicing|rope splices]] can retain nearly the full strength of the rope when forming loops and bends, conventional knots are much more practical in most situations.  Thus the prudent knot user will always allow for a large safety margin in the strength of rope chosen for a task due to the weakening effects of knots, ageing, damage, shock loading, etc.  In general, the '''safe working load''' is often specified as between 10% and 20% of the rated breaking strength of the rope being used.[http://www.boatsafe.com/marlinespike/safeload.htm]  For safety of life applications many other factors come into play which are beyond the current scope of this article.  Experienced practitioners should always be consulted before using ropes and knots when safety of life, limb, or property is involved.

===Security===

Even if the rope does not break, a knot may still fail to hold.  A knot which holds firm under a variety of adverse conditions is said to be more secure than one that does not.  The main ways knots fail to hold are:

==== Slipping ====
The tension from the load causes the rope to work back through the knot in the direction of the load.  If this continues far enough, the working end will pass into the knot and the knot unravels and fails.  This behavior can be worsened when the knot is repeatedly strained and let slack, dragged over rough terrain, or repeatedly impacted such as against a mast or flagpole.  

Even with secure knots, some slippage may occur as the knot is first put under real tension.  This can be dealt with by leaving plenty of rope at the working end outside of the knot and by dressing the knot cleanly and tightening it as fully as possible before loading.  In some cases the use of a stopper knot or, even better, a backup knot can prevent the working end from passing through the knot, but it is generally better to use a more secure knot if one is observed to slip.  In life critical uses backup knots are often added to already secure knots in order to maximize safety.

==== Capsizing ====
[[Image:Bowline (PSF).jpg|right|175px]]
Capsizing (or spilling) a knot is changing its form, rearranging its parts, usually by pulling on specific ends in specific  ways.  Some knots when used in an inappropriate way tend to capsize easily or even spontaneously.  Often the capsized form of the knot offers little resistance to slipping or unraveling.  For an excellent example of a knot that capsizes dangerously, see the discussion of the reef knot used as a bend.  

Sometimes a knot is intentionally capsized as a method of tying another knot, such as the &quot;lightning method&quot; of tying a Bowline.  Some knots, such as the [[Carrick Bend]], are generally tied in one form and then capsized to attain a stronger or more stable form.

==== Sliding ====
In knots that are meant to grip another object, failure can be defined as the knot moving relative to the object being gripped.  While the knot itself does not fail, it ceases to perform the desired function.  For example a simple [[Rolling hitch|Rolling Hitch]] tied around a railing and pulled parallel to the railing might hold to a certain tension and then start sliding.  Sometimes this can be corrected by working-up the knot tighter before subjecting it to load but usually a knot with more wraps, or a different size or type of rope will need to be used.

[[Image:Lifrarpylsa-Þorramatur.jpg|thumb|300px|Lifrarpylsa: liver sausage, cooking in a pot.]]
[[Image:Harðfiskur.jpg|thumb|right|Harðfiskur: wind dried fish.]]

'''Þorramatur''' (Thorramatur, food of the ''þorri'') is a selection of traditional Icelandic food, consisting mainly of meat and fish products cured in a traditional manner, cut into slices or bits and served with rúgbrauð (dense and dark [[Cookbook:Rye Bread|rye bread]]), [[Cookbook:butter|butter]] and brennivín (an Icelandic aquavite). Þorramatur is consumed during the ancient Nordic month of ''þorri'' (Thorri), in January and February, particularly at the mid-winter feast of Þorrablót (Thorrablot) as a tribute to old culture. Being thus connected with the tradition of Þorrablót festivals, Þorramatur is most often served as a buffet.

==Dishes==
Þorramatur consists of many different foods, including:

* '''Kæstur hákarl''', putrefied Greenland shark
* '''Súrsaðir hrútspungar''', the testicles of rams pressed in blocks, boiled and cured in lactic acid.
* '''Svið''', singed and boiled sheep heads, sometimes cured in lactic acid
* '''Sviðasulta''', [[Cookbook:Head cheese|head cheese]] made from ''svið'', sometimes cured in lactic acid
* '''Lifrarpylsa''' (liver sausage), a sausage made from the [[Cookbook:Organ Meat|offal]] and [[Cookbook:Liver|liver]] of sheep kneaded with rye flour
* '''Blóðmör''' (blood-fat; also known as slátur, meaning slaughter), a type of [[Cookbook:Blood pudding|blood pudding]], which is prepared like lifrarpylsa without the liver and adding blood.
* '''Harðfiskur''', wind-dried fish (often [[Cookbook:Cod|cod]], [[Cookbook:Haddock|haddock]] or [[Cookbook:Seawolf (fish)|seawolf]]), served with butter
* '''Rúgbrauð''' (rye bread), traditional Icelandic rye bread 
* '''Hangikjot''', (hung meat), smoked and boiled lamb or sheep meat
* '''Lundabaggi''', sheep’s loins wrapped in the meat from the sides, pressed and cured in lactic acid
* '''Selshreifar''', seal's flippers cured in lactic acid

During the month of ''þorri'', þorri buffets are quite popular in Iceland where many restaurants in Reykjavík and elsewhere serve þorramatur which is almost always served on wooden platters, called ''trog'' (trough). At these gatherings, Icelandic [[Brennivín]] is often consumed in copious amounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ultimate goal for many guitarists is to be able to create with the guitar - that is, to be able to conceive of a [[w:melody|melody]] or a chord sequence, &quot;hear&quot; it in one's head, and then translate it onto the [[w:fretboard|fretboard]].  Ideally, guitarists should be able to do so with the minimum possible latency and with as few errors as possible, and they should fail gracefully - that is, when they play an unintended note, they should be able to recover from the mistake.  The best improvising guitarists, from [[w:blues|blues]] players like [[w:Eric Clapton|Eric Clapton]] and [[w:Freddie King|Freddie King]] to jazz players like [[w:Wes Montgomery|Wes Montgomery]] and [[w:Allan Holdsworth|Allan Holdsworth]], have mastered this skill. 

==Selected Exercises==

*'''Practicing In The Dark'''

Staring at the fretboard while playing is considered the mark of an amateur.  In most performance situations, it isn't possible to look at the fretboard while still communicating visually with other musicians and with the audience.  In addition, looking at the fretboard introduces additional delay between thinking the note and playing the note, because the guitarist has to visually verify that his or her fingers are in the right place.

A good way to break yourself of this flaw is to practice with your eyes closed, or even better, to practice in the dark.  You will probably find yourself playing mostly clichés that lay out well under your fingers.  Resist the urge to do this.  Practice until you can play new or difficult phrases without looking at the neck.

*'''Visualization'''

Pianist and teacher Barry Harris stated in an interview for the 2008 Stanford Jazz Series that he believes that piano players would be better off if they played the &quot;piano in their head&quot; more often.  According to Carroll Smith's book &quot;Drive To Win,&quot; Formula One drivers can sit down in a chair, close their eyes, and move their hands and legs as though they were driving a lap, and surprisingly enough, they often get within several seconds of their actual lap times.

As a guitar player, you should do the same.

Practice running through a solo in your head, humming or singing the melody line and fingering in the air like you would on an actual guitar.  Without the feedback you get from hearing the notes coming from the instrument, your weaknesses are exposed.  Any chord or melodic fragment that you're not confident playing in the air will likely be played with hesitation on the actual guitar.  The other advantage to visualization is that you can do it anywhere, since it doesn't require a guitar.  People may give you strange looks as you walk down the street playing [[w:air guitar|air guitar]], but you can be self-assured in the fact that you're actually playing the right notes on your air guitar rather than strumming aimlessly.

*'''The Random-Note Game'''

As an improvising guitarist, if you're truly creating on the fly, you will make mistakes.  The best improvisers, including guitarists like [[w:John Scofield|John Scofield]], can use unintended notes as starting points for new motifs or ideas.  As an improvising guitarist, you need to know how to recover from a mistake.  Recovery requires that you first know what note you actually played relative to the chord change, and then find a way to proceed from that note in a logical way, usually resolving the dissonance into something consonant.

A good way to improve your fault tolerance is to play the random note game.  Put on a backing track with chord changes, such as the ones by Jamey Aebersold.  Close your eyes, move your left hand up and down the guitar neck, and pick a random string and a random fret.  Play the note.  First, listen to the note, and try to hear where it fits into the current harmony relative to the root note of the chord and to the other chord tones.  For example, maybe you just played the seventh instead of the sixth, or the flat third instead of the natural third.  Next, try to create a melodic line that starts on the note and resolves logically into the tune's harmonic structure.  There are a few devices you can try here:

* Is the note a member of the current or next chord or scale?  If so, you can play something diatonic (in the key).
* Is the note a member of a chord or scale that can resolve into the current chord or the next chord?  If so, play something over that chord, and then resolve it into the harmony.
* Is the note a member of a chord or scale that is a half-step off from the current chord?  If so, you can sidestep back into the correct key.
* Is the note a member of a chord or scale that can be substituted for the current harmony?  If so, play a line over the substitution, but keep a point in mind where you can enter back into the harmony of the tune.

This process will be difficult and time-consuming at first, but as you play more and more and experience the common scenarios and mistakes that you can make, recovery will move from a conscious (and slightly terrifying) process to an instinctual (and not so scary) one.

*'''The Science of the Unitar'''

&quot;The Science of the Unitar&quot; is an exercise popularized by Mick Goodrick, professor at Boston's Berklee College of Music and teacher to guitarists including Pat Metheny.  Basically, you practice playing major-scale lines using only a single string on the guitar.  Most guitarists spend the majority of their time playing in one of several positions or &quot;boxes&quot; where the major scale or the blues scale are laid out easily.  This exercise helps guitarists to break this tendency and become comfortable playing up and down the neck.

See the book &quot;The Advancing Guitarist&quot; for a more thorough description of this exercise.

*'''Exploring The Neck'''

Most guitarists start out by learning how to play chords and single notes in first position up to the fifth fret.  Next, they learn to play the blues scale in a few different positions, and if they're really diligent, they learn to play the major and minor scales in each of the five most common positions.  They end up very good at the common case of playing within a position, but transitioning between positions or playing licks that don't fall nicely within a position remains difficult.

Here are a few exercises you can try that will improve your familiarity with the neck:

* Take two pieces of tape and affix them to your guitar neck, five frets apart.  For example, put one before the 5th fret and one before the 10th fret.  You've just created a &quot;box&quot; that contains each note in the chromatic scale exactly once (with one exception in standard tuning).  Next, put on a jam track and practice playing the melody and improvising using only the notes in the box.  When you start to get comfortable in one position, move each piece of tape up a fret and do the same thing again with the same jam track in the same key.  You will probably need to start at a slow tempo and work your way up.  Don't be disappointed if you're less fluid than usual, or even if you sound downright bad - you've found a weakness and you're addressing it.

* Learn to play scales with four notes per string.  Start off with your first finger on the 3rd fret G on the bottom string of the guitar.  Play the G major scale up and down with four notes per string and one note per finger (no sliding).  As you ascend and descend the scale, your hand will have to move up and down the neck while also moving across the strings.  When you've mastered that pattern, play the dorian mode of the G major scale in the same fashion, starting with your first finger on the 5th fret A on the bottom string.  Repeat the exercise, starting on each of the notes in the G major scale.  Then try it with major scales in different keys, and finally with the melodic minor,harmonic minor, and diminished scales in different keys.  As you're playing, think about the patterns in the scales.  Do this every day until you can play the scales fluently.

* Repeat the exercise above using three notes per string, and then with two notes per string.

*'''Using All Your Fingers'''

Are you using all of your fingers?  If not, why not?  Think of how much more quickly and efficiently you could navigate the neck if you had full use of all of your fingers.

Note that &quot;proper&quot; technique is not an absolute requirement for making great music with the guitar.  Guitarist [[w:Django Reinhardt|Django Reinhardt]] is renowned for his contribution to jazz guitar, and what he did is even more amazing considering that he only had full use of two of the fingers on his left hand.  If you watch video of Wes Montgomery, you'll notice that when he played single note lines, he uses his first three fingers almost exclusively, using his little finger only for octaves and chords.  Nevertheless, using all your fingers effectively will open up a world of musical possibilities.  Allan Holdsworth is one example of a guitarist who has mastered this skill, and Kurt Rosenwinkel uses the same techniques to achieve a horn-like, legato sound on a &quot;clean&quot; guitar.

There are a few exercises you can do to improve the dexterity and strength of your little finger.  The &quot;Exploring The Neck&quot; exercises detailed above, especially playing scales with four notes per string, are extremely useful for this purpose.  In addition, placing artificial limitations on your playing while you practice can help to target specific scenarios.  For example, try playing scales and songs, or even improvising, using only your middle, ring, and little fingers.  You'll probably have to start at a slow tempo and work your way up.  For a good practice aid, try using Jamey Aebersold jam tracks in combination with a software program that can change the speed of a recording without changing the pitch.

*'''Tuning In Fourths'''

For many jazz and jazz-rock players, after they begin to improvise over music of a high level of harmonic complexity, the asymmetry inherent in standard tuning will become a limiting factor in their playing.  Songs which contain rapid transitions between key centers, such as [[w:Giant Steps|Giant Steps]] and other compositions based on [[w:Coltrane changes|Coltrane changes]], may be especially difficult to master in standard tuning.  

Tuning the guitar in fourths (EADGCF) eliminates many of these issues.  

[[w:Stanley Jordan|Stanley Jordan]] is the best-known guitarist to use this tuning.  Allan Holdsworth states that &quot;if I was starting guitar again, I'd tune in Perfect Fourths.&quot;  [http://www.jamierevell.co.uk/ (see link)]

Advantages of tuning in fourths include:
* Every shape on the fretboard translates directly into a musical interval.  In standard tuning, the same shape on different groups of strings may produce several different intervals.
* All chord shapes are usable across all groups of strings.  For example, a voicing on four adjacent strings is usable on three different combinations of strings with no change in fingering, whereas the same voicing in standard tuning would require three different fingerings for the three combinations of strings.
* All scales reveal their symmetry across the neck.  For example, given a pattern to play a one-octave major scale across three strings starting on the root note, you could apply this pattern at any location on the neck and get the same major scale.

The major disadvantages of tuning in fourths are:
* Obviously, re-learning of chords, scales, and licks is required.
* Many pop and rock songs that rely upon open chords are no longer playable in their original form.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What did they look like?==
[[Image:Human-brachiosaurus_size_comparison.svg|thumb|right|250px|Human compared to Brachiosaurus]]
Brachiosaurs could reach heights of up to 30 meters (100 feet) long and 13 meters (42 feet) tall, about as tall as 7 and a half humans! They could weigh up to 32 tonnes. Brachiosaurs walked on four legs, with the front legs being longer than the back legs. Brachiosaurs can be compared to modern day giraffes. Their huge size usually kept them safe from the predators of their time.
The largest fossil of it is by some paleontologists called Ultrasauros and the African form is sometimes called Giraffititan.                

==What did they eat?==
Brachiosaurs were herbivores that fed off of trees in the in conifer forests. 

==When did they live?==
Brachiosaurus lived 150 to 100 million years ago, in the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods.

==Where did they live?==
Brachiosaurus lived on land in conifer forests, which they fed off of. Brachiosaurs were once thought to live submerged in the water, but we now know that this is impossible because the pressure of the water would have stopped the animal from breathing.

==How were they discovered?==
Werner Janensch discovered the Brachiosaurus in 1914 in Tanzania.

==What do we need to learn?==
*Their skin color
*Whether they were cold or warm blooded

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unlike English, in Italian when talking directly about what job you do, you simply state ''I am journalist'' (''Sono giornalista'') or negate it (''Non sono giornalista''), you would only use the complete statement as in &quot;I am a journalist&quot; if you intent to underline your function (for instance in a group of people) or intend to categorize the function with an adjective (''non sono un giornalista veloce'').

When making a map, I set out the following instruments:

*a hard pencil
*a very good eraser
*several sheets of white paper
*a good ruler, with gradations of at least 1mm (1/16&quot;)
*a compass (not the north-south kind)
*some way of adding colour

==Workspace==
I try to have a large level table, or a drafting board, with a table close by, and a comfortable chair. Make sure that the work surface is clean and free of unnecessary clutter. This will ensure that you have plenty of room to work with the maps that you are making, and still have room to put them down for a minute, if you are working on multiple maps at once.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:International_Morse_code.png|right|framed|1922 Chart of the Morse Code Letters and Numerals]]
'''Morse code''' is a method for transmitting information, using standardized sequences of short and long marks or pulses — commonly known as &quot;dots&quot; and &quot;dashes&quot; — for the letters, numerals and special characters of a message. Originally created for Samuel Morse's electric telegraph in the mid-1830s, it was also extensively used for early radio communication beginning in the 1890s. However, with the development of more advanced communications technologies, the widespread use of Morse code is now largely obsolete, apart from emergency use and other specialized purposes, including navigational radio beacons, and by CW (continuous wave) amateur radio operators. Morse code is the only digital modulation mode designed to be easily read by humans without a computer, making it appropriate for sending automated digital data in voice channels, as well as making it ideal for emergency signaling, such as by way of improvised energy sources that can be easily &quot;keyed&quot; such as by supplying and removing electric power (e.g. by switching a breaker on and off).

Morse code can be transmitted in a number of ways: originally as electrical pulses along a telegraph wire, but also as an audio tone, as a radio signal with short and long pulses or tones, or as a mechanical or visual signal (e.g. a flashing light). Because Morse code is transmitted using just two states — on and off — it was an early form of a digital code. International Morse code is composed of six elements:
# short mark, dot or 'dit' (·)
# longer mark, dash or 'dah' (-)
# intra-character gap (between the dots and dashes within a character)
# short gap (between letters)
# medium gap (between words)
# long gap (between sentences)

Those learning Morse are often taught to send and understand letters and other symbols at their full target speed, that is with normal relative timing of the dots, dashes and spaces within each symbol for that speed.  Exaggerated spaces between symbols and words are used to give 'thinking time', which can be reduced with practice and familiarity. This makes the sound 'shape' of the letters and symbols easier to learn.  This teaching method is referred to as the '''Farnsworth method'''.  Another popular teaching method is the '''Koch method''', which uses the full target speed from the outset, but begins with just two characters.  Once strings containing those two characters can be copied with 90% accuracy, an additional character is added, and so on until the full character set is mastered.

As with other lists mnemonics may be used as a memory aid. Here is a United States version based on the NATO phonetic alphabet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The newer flag semaphore system uses two short poles with square flags, which a flagperson holds in different positions to signal letters of the alphabet and numbers. The flagperson holds one pole in each hand, and extends each arm in one of eight possible directions. Except for in the rest position, the flags cannot overlap. The flags are colored differently based on whether the signals are sent by sea or by land. At sea, the flags are colored red and yellow. While on land, they are red and white.

The following semaphore characters are presented as one would face the signalman (in other words, pretend you can see the signalman's face in the illustrations).  The letters ''almost'' follow a perfect, regular pattern, but don't be fooled by the first several.  '''J''', '''V''', and '''Y''' break the pattern.  We present them here in alphabetical order, and then again by position in a series of ''circles''.

====Tips====
When you are first learning semaphores, a good Bible text to practice with is Philippians 4:8, as it repeats the phrase &quot;whatever is&quot; several times.  Since it is so repetitive, You should be able to quickly signal the &quot;whatever is&quot; portion to get your speed up.  This verse contains all the letters of the alphabet except j, q, and z which can be learned afterwards.  

{{Bible verse
| book = Philippians
| chapter = 4
| verse =8
| version = NIV
| text =
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
}}
====Graphically====

{{Semaphores|W|H|A|T|E|V|E|R|}}
{{Semaphores|I|S}}
{{Semaphores|A|D|M|I|R|A|B|L|E}}
===More Tips===
Learn some landmark letters first and commit them to memory.  Groups of related letters are a good choice.  For example, these three make straight lines:
{{Semaphores|D|R|L}}
These four are made by holding the flags 90° to one another, but all are at 45° to the signaler:
{{Semaphores|U|N|I|X}}
These four are made by holding the flags 45° apart:
{{Semaphores|A|H|O|T}}
Most of these are fairly common letters (except for ''X''), so knowing them will allow you to spell the better part of most words.  Add an ''A'' and an ''S'' to the mix:
{{Semaphores|A|S}}
and you can spell a quick sentence:
{{Semaphores|U|N|I|X|.|I|S|.}}
{{Semaphores|A|.|H|O|T|R|O|D|.|O|S|.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to send Morse Code via wigwag flag, one must obviously first learn Morse Code.  See section a for details.  Second, one must know how to transmit dots and dashes with the wigwag flags.  The sender holds two flags, one in each hand.  The &quot;rest&quot; position is both flags straight up.  To send a dot, the flag on the right is lowered straight out to the right and then raised again.  To send a dash, the left flag is lowered straight out to the left and then raised again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The Manchu Tungusic language family consists of roughly 12 different languages that are spoken in a large geographical area stretching from Heilongjiang province and Inner Mongolia (both located in North East China) in the south, all the way through to the Arctic ocean in the north; from Sakhalin island, and the Kamchatka peninsula in the east, to the Yenisei river in the west. There are also several thousand speakers of a Manchu Tungusic language in Cabcal Sibe Autonomous County (察布查尔錫伯自治县) in North West China. Although speakers of Manchu Tungusic languages are spread over a huge geographical area, the actual number of people who speak one of the  languages is less than 100,000. 

Linguists working on Tungusic have proposed a number of different classifications based on different criteria, including morphological, lexical, and phonological characteristics. One classification which seems favoured over other alternatives is that the Tungusic languages can be divided into a northern branch and a southern branch, with the southern branch further subdivided into southeastern and southwestern groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
The core of an ISO metadata data registry is a collection of data elements.  These data elements represent the semantics or meaning of a data element within a standard or an organization.  Data elements do not necessarily map to a representation of data in a specific data store such as an RDBMS, an Excel spreadsheet, an XML file or a CSV file.  Data elements can store mappings to these representations via data maps.

There are two types of data elements in an ISO metadata registry:

'''Conceptual Data Elements''' - similar to RDBMS tables, concepts in a taxonomy tree, or object classes without the behavior.  Conceptual data elements are really collections for grouping similar properties.

'''Properties''' - are similar to a column of a table, a leaf element in a taxonomy, or an simple instance variable in an object class.

As with objects, properties can exhibit inheritance properties.  So if a superclass has a property, that property is valid for all subclasses.

== Implementation ==

Our ISO registry example will have an XForms application for storing both conceptual data elements and properties.  Both of these will be called generic data elements and they both share many attributes such as who created them, their definitions, and their mappings.  The only difference is that a conceptual data element has no property or data type assignment (representation term).

Each data elements will be stored in a separate XML file in a data element collection.  This allows multiple users to independently edit data elements and lock each data elements to avoid lost updates.

'''Kelewele''' is a fried plantain dish, akin to plantain chips.  This recipe makes 6-8 servings. It will take about 30&amp;nbsp;minutes to make, with 15&amp;nbsp;minutes of preparation time. 

==Ingredients==
* 4-6 [[Cookbook:Plantain|plantain]] bananas, peeled and cut into cubes or chips
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|cayenne pepper]] or [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[Cookbook:ginger|ginger]], peeled and grated
* 1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
* 2 tablespoons water or [[Cookbook:lemon|lemon juice]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable Oil|Vegetable oil]]

==Procedure==

* Grind together ginger, pepper, and salt. Mix with water.
* Add the plantain cubes to the spice mixture. Let it [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] for 10-20&amp;nbsp;minutes.
* Heat oil in a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|skillet]] to 180°C (350°F). At this temperature, the plantains should float.
* Add the plantains to the skillet and [[Cookbook:Deep-fry|deep-fry]] them. Turn them over once until golden brown on both sides. Do not overcrowd the skillet with plantains. 
* After frying, remove any excess oil by using an absorbent material. Serve hot and fresh.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

By: Sarah Wolff
----







== Learning Targets ==


• Reader should be able to identify key factors that influence a teacher’s decision to stop teaching.

• Reader should be able to identify the effects of low teacher retention.

• Reader should be able to identify ways by which states and schools can boost teacher retention.




== Introduction ==


Why do teachers leave the profession? Teacher attrition has been on the rise for the past two decades and it is no surprise that it has become a major concern. (Brooks-Young, 2007). Every year, approximately one-third of the nation’s teaching force turns over and the retention rate of new teachers after five years is only sixty-one percent. (Kersaint, 2007). Researchers believe that teacher shortages are caused not by lack of interest in teaching, but by too many teachers leaving the profession. (Williby, 2004). What must be addressed are the factors affecting teachers’ decisions to leave, the effects on the students and schools of low teacher retention, and the possible solutions to increase teacher retention. 




== Factors Influencing Teacher Turnover ==

According to Smithers and Robinson, there are five main reasons for teachers leaving the profession: workload, new challenges, school situations, salary, and personal circumstances. Among those five main reasons, workload was the most important factor in affecting teacher turnover, while salary was the least important. (Smithers &amp; Robinson, 2003). 

'''Workload'''

Being a teacher is not an easy job. Teachers must teach their students, as well as complete paperwork, lesson plans, assessments, etc., and at times this can be overbearing. There is an increase on assessment and accountability of teachers, which means there is an emphasis on testing, evaluation, and passing state standards. Teachers are required to teach to state standards and for their students to pass standardized tests, adding another requirement to be placed upon teachers. Also, many times, teachers are expected to sponsor a club or activity on top of everything else they must do. This means spending more time at school working. Meeting these requirements and juggling these tasks can be hard and frustrating, especially for new teachers with little experience.

'''New Challenges'''

New Challenges often cause new, inexperienced teachers to leave the profession. For the most part, their first few years in the classroom are spent trying to get organized, get a grasp on the pace of teaching the material, and learning how to effectively manage a classroom. Disruptive or troublesome students can make a teacher’s job that much more difficult by having to deal with the students and in some cases having to take disciplinary actions

'''School Situation'''

School situation encompasses many different things. It can be how the school is run, who runs the school, what type of programs are available to teachers, geographical setting of the school, and much more. Geography can play a major role in affecting a teacher’s decision on whether to leave the profession. In rural settings, the main reasons for teachers leaving was due to cultural differences, the geography (i.e. being too far away from a city or town), and professional isolation. (Williby, 2004). For urban settings, the reasons for leaving were an emphasis to oversee extracurricular activities and whether they were teaching at an at-risk school. How the school is run is also another factor causing teachers to leave. A lack of administrative support is damaging to a teachers self-esteem, poor facilities cause teachers to become frustrated, and insufficient mentoring leaves the teacher with nowhere to look for advice, and ultimately cause teachers to leave.

'''Personal Circumstances'''

Since teaching requires a lot of time and effort, sometimes personal circumstances can affect a teacher’s decision on whether or not to leave. The most common personal circumstance that causes teachers to leave is family. This encompasses everything from pregnancy, spending more time with family, and taking care of family. For women who get pregnant while teaching, they may find it more cost effective to leave and become a stay-at-home mother (Kersaint, 2007). For other teachers, quality time with their family and taking care of their family is very important and the workload of being a teacher doesn’t allow them much time to do this. Age is also another personal circumstance that causes teachers to leave. Typically, it is younger teachers or older teachers approaching retirement that usually leave the teaching profession. For older teachers, there is a direct correlation with early retirement and pension-plans. (Ingersoll, 2001). This means that it is more likely for an older teacher to retire if they have a pension plan.


== Effects of Teacher Turnover ==
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
The cost of teacher turnover is over $7 billion dollars a year. (NCTAF, 2007). 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

The effects of teacher turnover is astounding, not only for the school systems, but for the students as well. Teacher turnover can have a negative effect on student learning. Schools usually hire last-minute teachers who are under-qualified and inexperienced. (Kersaint, 2007). According to the National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future, inexperienced teachers are noticeably less effective than senior teachers. These new, inexperienced, and under-qualified teachers passing in and out of the school systems can have an emotional and physiological effect on students and student learning.


For the school systems, teacher turnover is a fiasco. It drains resources, diminishes teacher quality, undermines the ability to close the gap of student achievement, and is financially burdening. (NCTAF, 2007). Resources are drained due to the need of experienced teachers to train and mentor new teachers. Financially, schools are suffering from teacher turnover because of the cost of recruiting, hiring, advertising, and providing incentives. (Harris &amp; Adams, 2007). Ultimately, the effects of teacher turnover on the school systems directly impacts the students; the financial cost of teacher turnover takes money away from other projects that could be beneficial to the students, the quality of teachers hired directly impacts student learning and student achievement, and the school community and effectiveness can be destroyed.  



== Boosting Teacher Retention ==
So now the question is, what can be done to boost teacher retention? Teachers leave the profession for several reasons from lack of administrative support to poor facilities to low pay. There are several steps schools can take to boost teacher retention. 

To retain teachers that are inexperienced, schools can implement a well-organized induction program. This type of program would include mentoring and peer review evaluations. This allows teachers an outlet for help and instruction, as well as advice on how to improve performance. These types of programs also prepare teachers on what to expect and how to effectively do their job. Studies show that teachers who receive intensive mentoring are less likely to leave than those who receive little to no mentoring. (Williby, 2004). 

Other ways to boost teacher retention include new administrative and organizational strategies. Since workload is the major reason for teachers leaving the profession, strategies such as job sharing or part-time work may be more appealing to some teachers, or time to get work done during the school day through extended planning time, etc.

Hiring incentives are also another way to boost teacher retention. Although salary is not the biggest force driving teachers away from the profession, incentives would give them more of a reason to stay. These incentives inlcude: hiring bonuses, health insurance, pension plans, and higher salaries.



== Conclusion ==
All-in-all teacher turnover is a growing problem and must be solved. The reasons for why teachers leave the profession vary from teacher to teacher, but there is no doubt that something must be done to boost teacher retention. Teacher turnover effects student learning, student achievement, and the school systems. The cost is astounding, and new programs and strategies must be developed so teacher retention does not become an even bigger problem than it already is.

[[Image:Swiss fondue 2.jpg|right|280px|Caquelon]]
A '''Caquelon''' {{IPA|kakə'lõː}} &lt;fr.&gt; , (in some languages '''Gagglon''' or '''Gagglo'''),&lt;ref&gt; [[w:de:Caquelon]]&lt;/ref&gt;  is a cooking vessel of  stoneware, ceramic, enamelled cast iron, or porcelain for the preparation of [[Cookbook:Fondue|fondue]].

The word  is from a  Swiss French term originating in the 18th century derived from the Swiss German word ''Kakel'' meaning an earthenware [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans#Enameled Cast Iron|casserole]]. The term is in common use throughout Switzerland, and in the Franche-Comté and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France#Provence|Provençale]] regions of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:wiktionary:fr:Caquelon]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Dictionnaire historique de la langue française'', Dictionnaires Le Robert, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bottom of a caquelon requires a thickness sufficient to prevent burning of the melted cheese when the vessel is placed over a spirit burner at the table. Nevertheless, an encrusted layer of cheese forms on the bottom called the ''Grossmutter'' in German, ''La Religieuse'' in French, which is released when the fondue has been consumed and is shared between the diners.

== Problem user on Wikibooks ==

Just for your information, a user who has a history of contributing original research and harassing other users is currently moving their recently-deleted content to Wikibooks, according to a message on my English Wikipedia talk page (ref [[:w:en:User_talk:Dcoetzee#Hi_DECO_2]]). Deletion discussion at [[:w:en:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Optimal classification]]. Just a friendly warning - please repost this to the correct forum if this is the wrong place.

== images in mainspace pages which contain only text/formulas ==

FWIW, I'm relatively new to wikibooks. (in fact this is my first edit here)  Anyway, I was watching [irc://irc.freenode.net/cvn-wb-en &lt;tt&gt;#cvn-wb-en&lt;/tt&gt;] and I saw some image uploads by {{user|Jugandi}} which contained only text, tables, and formulas. (e.g. [[:Image:Antenna gain.gif|Antenna gain.gif]], [[:Image:Endfire equations.gif|Endfire equations.gif]]) Each of the images I reviewed was used in a single page ([[Communication Systems/Antennas]]) and even after looking at them in the context of that page I see no reason why they shouldn't just be wikified (possibly with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;math&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags and [[w:TeX]] markup).  Am I missing something?  If these images are abundant enough maybe there should be a tag to make them easier for interested editors to find?  Would these be eligible for [[WB:SPEEDY]] after their uses have been replaced with equivalent markup?  (the criteria don't seem to cover this situation)  BTW, I will shortly be editing [[WB:MOS]] in my second edit!  Err, one more thing... what do you call mainspace pages?  Books?  Cheers --[[User:Jeremyb|Jeremyb]] ([[User talk:Jeremyb|talk]]) 04:15, 6 August 2008 (UTC)
:Yes, those images can certainly be replaced with TeX markup; you're welcome to do so yourself. Once that is done, I imagine those would be an uncontroversial deletion.
:Mainspace pages are called &quot;modules&quot; - a collection of modules like [[Special:PrefixIndex/First Aid]] is a book.
:Glad to have you on board - I look forward to working with you further. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:53, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

:In theory, yes. Information which can be displayed using text, wikitext, and LaTeX should be displayed in that way because it's easily machine readable (which means it's easily bot-editable), more easily transformed into other document formats (including text-only formats), etc. However, and I can say this from experience, it's not always easy to translate an existing image of a formula or a table into our ASCII-based markups. I've seen examples of forumula images which used symbols which our LaTeX engine couldn't duplicate. I've seen examples of ''huge'' tables which were very difficult and time-consuming to translate into wikitext.
:The short answer is: Yes, the images should be replaced. The long answer is that there is not a pressing need for it to be done, that it can be done at people's leisure, that we can delete the images (trying to be as nice to the author as possible) when they are no-longer needed. Given the option between the two, I would much rather have an image-based table/formula now then not have one at all. Also, not everybody who edits knows enough about our markup to do it The Preferred Way anyway. I hope this helps. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:26, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

::Also, as to what we call the main namespace pages, the generic term is indeed &quot;module&quot;. However, if the page is the main page of a book we tend to call it a &quot;book&quot; or a &quot;TOC&quot;, and we tend to call subpages &quot;pages&quot; or &quot;book pages&quot;. Most of our pages are named &quot;Bookname/Pagename&quot;, so this metaphor fits nicely. But in general, &quot;module&quot; is fine. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 14:49, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

::Yeah, I had no intention of removing such images from modules or requesting deletion until  &quot;'''after their uses have been replaced with equivalent markup'''.&quot; (to quote my original comment above)  I agree that images would often require technical aptitude with respect to the various markups and syntaxes involved and that some are not suitable for representation in non-image forms.  I don't doubt there are some images which would be very time consuming to compose replacements for and would be very interested to see examples where glyphs from a formula could not be represented adequately with LaTeX.  (I wouldn't be surprised to see such examples though.  Oooh, I just reread your comment and I see you said it was the LaTeX engine in use not LaTeX itself; that makes more sense.)
::I don't believe the need to fix these is urgent but I do think it should be a priority given [[w:accessibility#Telecommunications and IT access|accessibility]] concerns.  See also [[Wikipedia:Accessibility]]. --[[User:Jeremyb|Jeremyb]] ([[User talk:Jeremyb|talk]]) 16:11, 6 August 2008 (UTC)

:::I replaced [[:Image:Antenna gain.gif|Antenna gain.gif]] with a wikitable at [[Communication Systems/Antennas]] ([{{fullurl:Communication Systems/Antennas|diff=1247312&amp;oldid=1247006}} diff]) and I've taken a [[User:Jeremyb/Sandbox#Image:Endfire equations.gif|first stab]] at replacing [[:Image:Endfire equations.gif|Endfire equations.gif]] in the same module.  This is my first time using LaTeX or TeX, my math's a little rusty (although I did do multi-variable calc), I don't know the subject area at all, and some of the notation is foreign to me so there's plenty of room for error.  It would be great to get some eyes on those (hopefully from someone who knows the subject matter!)

== Is it possible to create a Wikibook under Creative Commons license? ==

I teach Linux system administration and I'm considering to start a Wikibook for course material. I would prefer to publish the book under a CC license. Is this possible at all? As far as I understand it, the Free Documentation License is not compatible with the GPL nor the Creative Commons licenses.
:No, they're not compatible (yet). At some point in the future, they likely will be, and we will probably migrate our content to CC-by-sa-xx. May I ask why you want to use CC-by-sa instead of the GFDL? &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:43, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

: I asked around a while back before starting [[uim]]. I was interested in publishing the book under a public domain license. The response as well as the precedence(s?) I could find was that I could set it up as PD from the outset and a clear notice stating that all contributions to the book would be in the public domain that didn't get contested should be sufficient. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:35, 8 August 2008 (UTC)
::That is a different approach and you are intentionally aiming to publish the work. In any case you can't on Wikibooks exclude the GFDL+Exceptions (as I like to label it) as a license. You should be able to make any proposal on the licensing of the work, and PD isn't a license but a state of the rights over a work, the GFDL would impose limitations on the PD status (since it gives a greater level of freedom). The second and probably the biggest problem would be checking that no GFDL content outside of direct contributions to the work is used on the edits, for instance using Wikipedia material wouldn't be possible.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:57, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

No you can't use another license for the text content of the book. Every time you or someone else edits the page it states just below the edit box that all contributions to Wikibooks are considered to be released under the GFDL. You also can't force a book to be dual licensed, because anyone could opt out of the GFDL which isn't allowed, opting out of the other license would defeat the purpose, and requiring both licenses to
be used for all derived works would probably be considered a violation of WMF policy or a violation of the CC-BY-SA license. The most you can probably do is dual license your own contributions and mention this on your user page with something like &quot;I release all my contributions under the terms of the GFDL and CC-BY-SA licenses unless otherwise stated. You may choice which license you use.&quot; This only applies to text contributions though. For images and other media you can use any free license including CC-BY-SA. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:38, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

:I couldn't disagree more with that statement &quot;No you can't use another license for the text content of the book&quot;. We've discussed this issue heatedly and I'm not alone on my interpretation. But facts and the historic process must be taken in consideration, one example of existing dual license works is [[Scratch/Content_License]], I will state that a dual license will not collide with the copyright notice on each edit action, more so the notice is a requirement of the copyright policy, every edit on Wikibooks must be granted to Wikimedia using the GFDL+Exceptions as stated in the policy, that copyright notice satisfies that requirement that &quot;By clicking &quot;Save page&quot; you are indicating you grant the Wikimedia Foundation a license to use your work under terms of the above bolded text. If you do not agree with these terms, then do not submit your work to this website.&quot; the bolded text is the GFDL+Exceptions, but it does not exclude in any way the use of more licenses (but one must be the GFDL+Exceptions at least while the work is on the project) as the policy clearly states &quot;unless otherwise indicated&quot;, one can put a statement on one's talk page that will cover the user own contributions (like the above post states) or in the license attribution of the work the is targeted by the multiple licensing, no one on Wikibooks may opt out of the GFDL+Exceptions (that is clearly stated on the policy), the only problem is that such works can't use other content that is licensed only under the GFDL since it permits future versions to opt out and possible constitute a violation of the copyright holders rights by way of permitting an unauthorized relicensing if their work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:09, 9 August 2008 (UTC)
:The [[Uim]] book does not fall under dual licensing, in that case Wikibookians that have rights over their contributions are only stating that they will put any right they may hold into the public domain, but the license is the GFDL+Exceptions at least on Wikibooks, it can be argued that since the copyright holders have released it under PD and by the statement on the book, it grants the right to any future version to be re-licensed without special considerations even for commercial or non public uses.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 00:25, 9 August 2008 (UTC)

By submitting text work to Wikibooks you agree to release your contributions under the GFDL as is Wikibooks' policy. The same cannot be said for any other licensing terms. There is no obligation on the part of a contributor to release there contributions under another license or to continue to use the dual license model. So once someone hits that submit button, the work becomes GFDL-only unless the contributor says otherwise on the user page. Any dual licensed work submitted on Wikibooks risks becoming GFDL-only when someone modifies it on Wikibooks. People can only use another license outside of Wikibooks for those contributions that were dual licensed and not for the modifications where the contributors did not agree to dual license. Wikibooks cannot in my opinion require contributors to dual license there contributions or put another way cannot forbid opting out of CC-BY-SA or public domain. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:43, 9 August 2008 (UTC)

:If the work clearly indicates that it is has more than one license any contributions will fall also under that work license . If contributors don't want to license their contributions under a multiple license they should check how the book is licensed.  &quot;Wikibooks cannot in my opinion require contributors to dual license there contributions or put another way cannot forbid opting out of CC-BY-SA or public domain.&quot; I partially agree with you sentiment not that it is a requirement (it isn't, the users have alternatives) but because it can become problematic if similar works were to be created and the only major difference was the license scheme selected, in this sense standardization of the license used would facilitate matters, for me the GFDL is good enough. But as things stand we as a community will have to chose allowing that freedom and enable a greater number of contributions of content or restricting it to a single license. Personally I don't have a preference nor a solution if in future such situation presents itself, I would probably support the existence of both works since the important aspect is to  enable production of content...  The project survives only due to donation of content, work and money, restricting it would be detrimental to the project. In the case at hand it would result in alienating a future contributor.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:11, 9 August 2008 (UTC)

:I've been thinking about this problem. We seem to be addressing the multiple license only on the exclusion aspect, if the licenses are contradictory to each other (and so objectionable by adherents of the other), or that the motivation was to temporarily bypass a limitation. On the examples we have so far seen, similar (but not compatible) licenses have been used. It is even possible to satisfy all the licenses requirements at the same time without any collisions (at least I didn't detect any) so the works after being dual licensed (lets simplify) will probably never change its status, in this case, content of works sharing any of the licenses can be used (if the license used permits it), in the case of GFDL or CC-BY-SA there would be no special problem. In the presence of very similar licenses I don't see a problem nor a rational reason for a contributor to object to it. This  is probably the reason for the inexistence on the project of similar books that only diverge on the licensing, or why the number of multiple licensed works is so small...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 17:25, 9 August 2008 (UTC)

::What amazes me in this whole discussion is that it seems to be completely ignoring earlier discussions about this very topic that have gone on seemingly ad nausium.  This is hardly the first time this topic has come up, and I highly doubt that it will be the last.

::There is nothing in either Wikibooks policy nor Wikimedia policy that demands exclusivity with the GFDL, nor does the GFDL prevent dual-licensed content co-existing with exclusively GFDL-licensed content (as long as they are clearly marked as such).  Here is a user that is much more comfortable with one particular but unfortunately (perhaps at the moment) incompatible licenses.  I can even picture an entire team of individuals who perhaps want to add content under terms beyond just the GFDL.  Are we really trying to tell these individuals that we &quot;don't want their kind&quot; here on this project?

::Yeah, there is an issue for what the project policy may be in terms of people '''''on this website and for clearly marked dual-licensed book projects''''' may be in terms of adding contributions to those kind of projects.  From a strictly legal point of view, I don't think there is a problem requiring subsequent users '''on this website''' for contributing under both licenses when such dual-licenses are clearly noted.  Downstream users is a different issue, but that kind of forking is not what we are talking about.

::The real issue comes when some user insists on contributing exclusively with the GFDL on such dual-licensed wikibooks.  Should such a fork be allowed on Wikibooks?  Why or why not?  Does such a user essentially destroy the dual licensing?

::I think such sorts of dual licensing can and indeed should be encouraged if it helps to expand Wikibooks and bring fresh talent and opportunities to this website.  There are also very legitimate reasons (which can be stated very clearly in a book introduction) for why dual-licensed content may be desired well above and beyond just the whims of those who are starting the book.  It would be a crying shame that such sort of book project can't be started strictly because the &quot;community&quot; here on Wikibooks doesn't want to see dual-licensed content here because it is too complicated to think about.  It also doesn't have to be all that complicated.

::This is also a completely different issue from relicensing content, which is a whole different can of worms.  The dual-license must be established right at the beginning of the writing of the book for it to be effective at all.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 04:09, 15 August 2008 (UTC)

== Question ==

Hello...

I'm new to Wikipedia and Wikibooks, and the
information concering documentatin and copyright is 
confusing at first read, and second read, and...

My question: I want to use a few definitions and receipes in a cookbook I am preparing for a foster family agency; it's a fundraiser.

What can I use, how much, and how do I cite the material I use in the book?

== Asking the help of Wikibookians ? ==

Hello Everyone! My name is Sylvain and I have been told in the Wikipedia village pump to ask for your help. I am currently writing my dissertation on the organisation of Wikipedia for my master of political philosophy at the University of Sussex. I got a little problem: I am a french native and my english is still not so perfect for a dissertation, therefore I need it to be checked. My fellows are also currently in their work so I cannot really bother them for that.. Then I had this idea of publishing my work-in-progress dissertation on the Wikibooks in order to get the help of some people to check my grammar an stuffs. Do you think there could be any people willing to help me for that? I'm waiting for your views and advices! :) Yours, --[[User:Karibou|Karibou]] ([[User talk:Karibou|talk]]) 16:22, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:Yes there surely will. But you should probably use your user-space for the work until it reaches the state you like. Since your dissertation isn't yet published (and depending on the content) see [[WB:WIW]] on the topic of original research, pages can then later be moved to where you think they best fit, if your University publishes your work in any way you can then request a move to Wikisource and/or keep a copy evolving here (probably on a broader topic, again depending on the topic).  Hope this helps.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:33, 1 August 2008 (UTC)
:Well, [[WB:OR|Wikibooks is not for publishing original research]], however [[v:Wikiversity|Wikiversity]] might be a good place to head. There is also a [[wikia:Academia]], which would be a much more appropriate location. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:56, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:This idea is a little dangerous, I think. First off, it's your dissertation. It's one of the most important things you might ever write. You don't want to open it up to &quot;the crowd&quot; because all sorts of things could creep into it. Wikibooks is probably not the right place because of our prohibition on original research (as Mike pointed out). Wikiversity is too open, and it's going to be impossible for you to keep control over it. Academia Wikia (again, as mike pointed out) might be a decent place too, but you're still leaving it open for anybody to play around on.
:I personally would be happy to proofread it for you, although I would only have enough time to go over 1 draft of it. You might be able to find a few other volunteers as well who would be willing to proofread various drafts of it. It is about Wikipedia, and Wikipedia is popular enough. Good luck with it, whatever you decide. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:07, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

== change in intentions with which the book was created ==

I created [[The Book of Mathematical Proofs]] in Sept 2007 originally with the [[Talk:The_Book_of_Mathematical_Proofs#Book_Intentions|stated]] aim of creating a collection of all possible mathematical definitions, theorems and proofs. Increasingly I started feeling that this amounts to just creating an encyclopaedia of mathematics, a function well served elsewhere. The book has too gigantic a scope if built with this intention and is doomed to fail. The only alternative I feel would be to change the original objectives of the book, and instead to create a repository of the beautiful/good proofs in mathematics, without any regard to the various fields they belong to. For example, the Pythagoras Theorem, Euler's Theorem, Fermats theorem etc can qualify as beautiful proofs. The community can decide by consensus on the talk page whether any proof is worthy of being included or not. Any comments?--[[User:Shahab|Shahab]] ([[User talk:Shahab|talk]]) 17:55, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

:Designing a book is a process, not a single event. You can't expect that the book is going to be completely perfect before you start writing. I've created a few books that looked great as an outline, but which needed radical changes once the writing started. In short, it's perfectly acceptable and normal to have to change the book after you've already created it. The more you write, the more you can identify the strengths and the weaknesses of the design. It would be foolish not to change things as problems become obvious.
:Now, I would be weary about using the phrase &quot;beautiful proofs&quot;, since beauty is incredibly subjective. It may be better, marginally, to do something like &quot;influential proofs&quot; or &quot;famous proofs&quot;. However, even &quot;influential&quot; and &quot;famous&quot; are a little subjective. Basically, as the author you need to figure out what ''you'' want to write about, and then just write about it. You can attach rhyme or reason after the fact. Good luck! --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 18:05, 2 August 2008 (UTC)

== Naming Policy ==

Looking at [{{fullurl:Wikibooks:Naming_policy|diff=381719&amp;oldid=368793}} this diff], the new [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|naming policy page]] deleted a lot of useful information, particularly the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Naming_policy&amp;oldid=368793#Page_structure advantages and disadvantages of the 'flat' and 'hierarchical' naming conventions]. I can understand that there are advantages to keeping the policy page from being too verbose, but there are also advantages in retaining some of the info that was deleted.

Would it be okay to restore some of this info in the policy page, otherwise it could go to a new 'guidelines' page.

What do others think?

[[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:58, 5 August 2008 (UTC)

:Since the page documents an official policy if you think it has lost the meaning of the approved policy you should restore it to the point it best reflects the approved status. Further edits to an approved policy are only acceptable if they intend to clarify or reduce the verbosity of the approved policy without adding to it, if a edit is contested it would generate a new proposal (revert and create a proposal that restates of the alterations). Due to the type of information you intend to add, mostly fall under clarification and isn't to extensive you should go right ahead and do it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:30, 5 August 2008 (UTC)

wow that i so wonderful! &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Marinaherrera|Marinaherrera]] ([[User talk:Marinaherrera|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Marinaherrera|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

I notice that between the two changes that there were multiple proposals on the page, that the page went from a proposed policy to an enforced policy, and the comment for the changes suggests the changes were discussed and agreed with prior to being done. Reverting to an earlier version as Panic suggests would go against what was approved of unless the community agrees to including it again. Likely the extra information was considered informative, but not something that contributed to what the naming requirements should be and what the policy was trying to achieve. Also some (if not all) of the information pertaining to the advantages and disadvantages of the flat and hierarchical naming conventions exists within [[WB:LMOS|local manual of style]]. If you feel that isn't enough to be useful, I think including the information in [[Help:Starting a new page or book]] and/or [[Using Wikibooks]] so that people new to Wikibooks can find this information could help. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:57, 5 August 2008 (UTC)

:I suggested a reversion to a previous approved version, &quot;if you think it has lost the meaning of the approved policy you should restore it&quot; I didn't include last on the phrase but that is implied, I also did a simple check to what was the last approved version but failed to come to any conclusion, some time ago I've proposed a solution to the situation that now exists , if after a vote someone fails to provide a useful comment or to &quot;lock&quot; the version under vote also with a meaningful comment if someone needed to check the edits it will requires a lot of work. Making any study or analysis on how policies/guidelines evolve over time would be near impossible.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:12, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

== PDF extension ==

It's like a dream come true, the PDF Extension is in testing now at [http://en.labs.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_to_print Wikimedia Labs]:

http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2008-August/001299.html

The best part about it is, Wikimedia labs uses a copy (perhaps a slightly old one) of the en.wikibooks database. That way, we can test the feature on our own content. 

What the extension does is allows you to create &quot;collections&quot; of pages to convert automatically into a PDF. You select pages you like, put them in the order you want, and then create the PDF from that. Sound like a book maybe? The best part is we can save collections, either privately in your own userspace or publicly in the Wikimedia: namespace. In this way, anybody can immediately produce a PDF of the most up-to-date version of the book, on demand. No more PDF versions that take a lot of time to produce by hand and are immediately out of date as soon as an edit has been made. Anybody can do it too, not just admins or PDF-saavy super editors.

I encourage all Wikibookians to come test out this out and, if you like it, to beg shamelessly until they install it here! This is going to be a great extension, and one that will help Wikibooks out a lot. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:20, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

The &lt;nowiki&gt;{{PDF version|filename}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; seems to have a problem, the info will generate a pdf that fails to open and there is no way for users to understand that the PDF is not dynamically generated but a snapshot in time of the book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:14, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

:I've noticed this problem before, and I don't know what the solution is. The template creates an ordinary Media: link which should link directly to the PDF file. I assumed the problem was something in the upload server. Is there a way for us to fix it here on our end in the template, or is it a bigger problem with the servers? 
:As for the point about the template not having a lot of information, you are correct. We need to fix that. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:05, 1 August 2008 (UTC)

::I have tested it on the All Chapters Version of the C++ Programming book (the only that generated any useful content) and it seems fine reasonable quick on ~138 pages (parsed) generates a ~498 page PDF.

Just a quick technical note: You can now use the &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; keyword to mark pages that should not be indexed by web-crawling search engines, such as google.

== Changing Special:Random to exclude subpages without javascript ==

There is a feature of Special:Random that when set could be used to pick only books that follow Wikibooks' naming convention. This has the advantage of not requiring javascript, which makes it accessible to more people, who either don't use a javascript enabled browser or the javascript simply doesn't work for whatever reasons in their browser of choice. However there are two possible downsides to this. Pages in books which don't follow Wikibooks' naming convention would still sometimes be picked and picking any random page would become impossible. Neither of these are problems with the current javascript approach. So the question is should Wikibooks request the developers to enable this feature for Wikibooks or not? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:25, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

:{{support}} for some clarification, this would be a software change at the MediaWiki level that changed the behavior of [[Special:Random]]. With the change, [[Special:Random]] would only pick top-level book pages, not subpages. We haven't had a &quot;Random Page&quot; link in the side bar for some time now, and have been relying instead on the JavaScript-based &quot;Random Book&quot; link. Unless anybody has a particular use for the current behavior of [[Special:Random]], I think we should enable this feature post-haste. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:55, 14 August 2008 (UTC)

Hi, I am trying to use the Latin/spoken/lesson 1 module.  When I click on the audible link, I receive an error message that I have to be an autoconfirmeduser.  I am logged in and have an account.  What else do I need to do?
Thanks.

== Intended book is just a module ==

Greetings!

When I started my first book: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computers_%26_Society Computers &amp; Society]
I did not notice that it was classified as a module.

I need to re-classify it properly. Can it be done?
(Михал Орела 20:01, 27 August 2008 (UTC))

Thank you very much for very speedy response and action.
Now I think I will sleep easy. :) (Михал Орела 20:34, 27 August 2008 (UTC))
== build a computer ==

I build my own pc, but when I start it works for 10 sec  and turn off.
What is going on ??
:It's most likely either a power issue (power supply's not rated high enough for what you're doing, something's faulty or not plugged in) or an overheating protection (is the heatsink properly attached to the cpu?). - [[Special:Contributions/208.85.203.242|208.85.203.242]] ([[User talk:208.85.203.242|talk]]) 23:00, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

== New Account Creation problems ==

Well, I found that there is a Rails book here, which is quite useful (the official docs are rather a mess), and I was going to edit something about lighttpd.  I guessed that I probably had an account here, so I tried logging in:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Login error:
There is no user by the name &quot;Xiong Chiamiov&quot;. Check your spelling, or create a new account.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ok, then, I guess I didn't make one.  Let's register then:

&lt;big&gt;By: Karen Herndon&lt;/big&gt;

== Introduction ==


Have you ever asked yourself what the purpose of education is? It is believed to be a question that is highly thought about but in reality it is not. We tend to focus on the tasks at hand rather than the overall goal. Many will find that when asked specifically what education’s purpose is, the answer in return is nothing outside of the course curriculum (Bass, 1997). Well you may be questioning why this is. In order to provide an answer we need to consider both sides of the topic. On one hand the government controls the educational system which enforces the use of mandatory testing to evaluate each student as well as the educational institution. In other words, emphasis is placed on providing students with the skill that they will need to succeed. On the other hand, there is the belief that children should not only be presented with the abilities to learn but they should be able to expand what is given through individual growth and development beyond materials obtained from the classroom. Their inner talents need to be brought out and polished (Minor, 2007).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;ARIAL&quot;&gt; “Do not then train youth to learn by force and harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.&quot; ~Plato (Minor, 2007) 

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;


== Government Effects on Education’s Purpose ==


If one looks closely at the government’s heavy involvement in what to teach and what not to teach children it’s the administering of assessment tests. These tests do not allow a child to form opinions on subjects which in turn impedes social growth and development. The government forces school districts to meet certain minimal requirements so unfortunately the focal point has become mainly to teach material that students will need to know in order to obtain passing scores on standardized tests (Bass, 1997). This is attributed to the government’s implementation of laws such as the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) (A Firsthand Look at NCLB, 2006). Students are expected to follow certain guidelines and curriculum; however teachers are pressed for time. In order to ensure they achieve all of the mandated guidelines and curriculum they teach only what they are required to. This leaves little time to introduce material to students that may be beneficial to them in the long run (Bass, 1997). For example the NCLB has received strict criticism for focusing too much on testing and not enough on actually teaching and allowing the student to further their knowledge. It has been brought up that the NCLB’s ignorance towards equity has caused problems. For instance one school system may possess funding which would make it easier to obtain the minimum passing score versus a school system that lacked funding. (A Firsthand Look at NCLB, 2006). 


== Social Development’s Role in Education ==


Education is not only being presented with material to learn but to also expand one’s knowledge of themselves and their surroundings. It appears that the growing trend today in school systems is to teach students particular course work with little to no regard to instruction on how this material could relate to life. Since most subjects utilize textbooks they are heavily relied upon and do not allow the student much freedom to think outside the box (Lim, 2005). Children will naturally form opinions from the material that is presented  and being able to express these opinions will only help them to grow socially and eventually fit in with the rest of the world. Social growth is very important because when it is time for the child to become independent if they have not developed that part of their life then interaction with other people and situations could be quite daunting. Most parents and parental guardians do want their child to follow a structured curriculum; however, they still want their child to have time for recreation and family. Childhood is an important part of everyone’s life. It encourages social interaction and development as well as teaching them to be independent. People that are deprived of their childhood regret it when they grow up which could negatively impact their lives and the lives of others (Lim, 2005).

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt; “The only purpose of education is to teach a student how to live his life-by developing his mind and equipping him to deal with reality. The training he needs is theoretical, i.e., conceptual. He has to be taught to think, to understand, to integrate, to prove. He has to be taught the essentials of the knowledge discovered in the past-and he has to be equipped to acquire further knowledge by his own effort. ~Ayn Rand 
(Yero, 2001-2002. p.1)

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Thomas Jefferson’s View ==


With regard to the purpose of education Thomas Jefferson was one of the biggest advocates of the principle that ignorance and political liberty could not co-exist. Jefferson believed the purpose of education was to properly prepare young minds so they would be able to make educated decisions and uphold the integrity of the country. He insisted on providing four main subjects to elementary school students. Geography, arithmetic along with reading and writing made up these subjects. These subjects were deemed crucial for the proper development of children in order to function later in life. One example of this is that Jefferson believed that children needed to be given proper education in order to become informed voters. He supported free education through taxation as well as equal opportunity education. Jefferson believed the purpose of education was not to segregate but to educate (Jewett, 1997).



== Evaluating Student Assessment ==


Getting back to assessment and student evaluation drives one to consider if whether we are going about education wrong as a country by placing so much importance upon standardized tests. As previously stated, it has been debated whether The No Child Left Behind Act does little to expand the constantly developing minds of our youth (A Firsthand Look at NCLB, 2006). A child’s mind can be compared to a sponge, in that they need to soak up information and substance in order for it to expand, otherwise, it dries out. If you observe the examinations and how students are generally evaluated in today’s school systems, you will see that the vast majority of them are made up of multiple choice questions. Since there is typically only one correct answer, it is almost impossible for the child to reflect upon the question and develop a view that they can grow from or share with others if they so choose (Yero, 2001-2002).



== In Summation ==


When considering both sides of the purpose of education you may want to reflect on the words of Plato when he said: “Do not then train youth to learn by force and harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each (Minor, 2007).” However, the government’s involvement in education has had positive impacts on students since the NCLB has forced teachers and other school officials to focus on all children including those with special needs (A Firsthand Look at NCLB, 2006). No matter what side of the river you are on with regard to your opinion on this topic, it is hard to discredit the fact that one purpose (if not the main purpose) of education is to prepare the youth for their future and ours.

'''Foudue'''

The regional names of the various fondues refer to the cheeses used in their preparation.  It is a mistake to think that these connotations dictate the preparation method in those regions at the present time. The Swiss like to rotate recipes no matter what part of Switzerland they live in. However, [[Cookbook:Fondue neuchateloise|foundue neuchâteloise]] is possibly the most frequently prepared nationwide.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Switzerland|Swiss cuisine]]

Yield: For 4 persons

===Ingredients===

*400 g Gruyêre cheese, grated (1 lb.)
*400 g Emmenthaler cheese. grated (1 lb.)
*400 ml dry white wine (2 cups)
**Rule of thumb: 200 g (8 oz.) cheese to 100 ml (½ cup) wine 
*1 or more cloves garlic
*4 tsp. cornstarch
*50 ml kirschwasser (¼ cup)
*pepper, freshly ground
*nutmeg. freshly grated
*1 lb. or more baguettes (French bread), cut into bite-size cubes.

It is necessary to use bread of the correct texture and size.  The bread should not be too soft and it should be cubed in such a way that each cube retains part of the crust.  The cube is then pierced through the crust into the crumb.   This prevents the bread from slipping off into the fondue.  This sometimes happens anyway, of course, and in Switzerland there is a tradition when eating fondue in a restaurant (optional depending on the crowd), that if one is guilty, one buy a round of schnapps for the whole party.

==Procedure==

#Rub the caquelon with the clove of garlic. Alternatively, if one likes more garlic, chop finely and throw in the caquelon. 
#Add the dry white wine and warm slightly on the stove top, over a low flame. 
#Mix the cornstarch with the cheese so that the cheese particles are well dusted and add to the warm wine. 
#Melt the cheese stirring constantly in a figure eight pattern.  
#Stir until the mixture has thickened and starts to boil up. 
#Away from the heat, add the kirschwasser and blend in. Traditionally, the cornstarch is mixed into a slurry with the schnapps and added with it at this point. However, adding the cornstarch with the cheese makes it less likely that the fondue will &quot;turn&quot; (separate) and this method is used in many recipes for fondue. 
#Season with nutmeg and freshly ground pepper (black or white as you prefer). 
#Bring to the boil another 1 or 2 times. 
#Bring the caquelon to the table and place on the stand over the spirit burner.  The heat should be regulated carefully so that the fondue stays hot but does not boil.

Each diner has a dinner plate to hold bread cubes and accompaniments, and catch drips.
Skewer cubes of bread with a fondue fork and dip into the cheese, turning the fork over to coat all sides. 
If you are especially hygiene conscious, agree between yourselves to slide the bread off onto your plates and eat it with a separate fork, resting the fondue fork in the caquelon while you are eating.

===Blitz method===
If you are in a hurry:
#Pour the wine into a cold caquelon with the garlic. 
#Mix the cornstarch to a slurry with the schnapps and add it to the wine.   
#Now heat rapidly while whisking until the wine boils up and thickens.
#Lower the heat and add the cheese a handful at a time until it melts, stirring constantly.
*As unconventional as this method is, it almost guarantees that your fondue will not separate because the stabilizing properties of the cornstarch are activated at the start.

===What to do if your fondue separates===
If the right conditions for emulsification are not present, the aqueous and fatty components of a fondue may separate in much the same way as a mayonnaise may do so.  This can be caused by the wrong  proportion of liquid to fat.  In mayonnaise making, the problem occurs as a result of adding the oil too quickly. In a fondue the problem may occur in a number of ways:

#When using the traditional method (straight wine and cheese), melting occurs too rapidly.
#The water boils off leaving too much fat in proportion to aqueous component.
#The aqueous component is too great to hold an emulsion.
#There is insufficient starch to stabilize the emulsion.
#A combination of the above.

The most effective solution is to: 
#Dissolve some more cornstarch in a half cup (50 ml) of wine.
#Put the fondue back on the stove top over medium heat.
#When it is boiling, lower the heat and slowly add the slurry while beating vigorously until thickening of the starch has occurred.
#If it is too thick, add more wine, a little at a time until the right consistency is achieved, stirring constantly.
#If necessary add some more grated cheese to taste.

Once you learn how it's done, this is always effective.

'''Online Library of Manchu Language Texts''' &lt;br&gt;

This free online Library of Manchu texts aims to provide a one stop collection of all Manchu texts that are no longer subject to copyright laws (add wikisource link here).  All texts will use the Möllendorff transliteration method, which will mean that any user that wants to download the text can just cut and paste the content straight from the page. In time, each text should include English and Chinese translations, and as this is a wiki users will be able to make corrections and monitor changes in the texts to ensure accuracy.

[[Image:Gruyère cheese.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Gruyêre cheese]]

'''Gruyère''' IPA: [ɡʁy.jɛʁ] (Groo-Yair) is a hard yellow cheese made from cow's milk, named after the town of Gruyères in Switzerland, and made in the cantons of Fribourg, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Jura, and Berne. Before 2001, when Gruyère gained Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée status as a Swiss cheese, some controversy occurred as to whether French cheeses of a similar nature could also be labelled Gruyère. (French Gruyère-style cheeses include Comté and Beaufort.) French Gruyère-style cheeses must have holes according to French agricultural law, whereas Swiss Gruyère is a solid cheese with no holes.

Gruyère is sweet but slightly salty, with a flavour that varies widely with age. It is often described as creamy and nutty when young, becoming with age more assertive, earthy, and complex. When fully aged (five months to a year) it tends to have small holes and cracks which impart a slightly grainy mouth feel. To make an 80 kg round of Gruyère cheese, about 800 litres of milk are used.

==Uses==
Gruyère is generally known as one of the finest cheeses for baking, having a distinctive but not overpowering taste. In [[Cookbook:Quiche|quiche]], Gruyère adds savouriness without overshadowing the other ingredients. It is a good melting cheese, so particularly suited to [[Cookbook:Fondue|fondue]]s, along with Vacherin and [[Cookbook:Emmental Cheese|Emmental]]. It is also traditionally used in [[Cookbook:Onion Soup|French onion soup]], as well as in [[Cookbook:Croque Monsieur|Croque Monsieur]], a classic French toasted ham and cheese sandwich.  It is a fine table cheese, and when grated, it is often used with salads and pastas. It is used, grated, atop [[Cookbook:Le Tourin|Le Tourin]], a type of garlic soup from France which is served on dried bread.

== Varieties ==

Le Gruyère Switzerland AOC has many different varieties with different aged profiles and an organic version of the cheese is also sold. There is a special variety that is produced only in summer on the Swiss Alps: the Le Gruyère Switzerland AOC Alpage. 

Generally you can distinguish the following age profiles.

*mild/doux: min. 5 months old
*réserve: min. 10 months old

In Switzerland, many other age profiles can be found, including surchoix, vieux, salé, grotte (cave aged). All these age profiles are not part of the AOC.</text>

&lt;big&gt;'''Brain Metastases Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Incidence==
*Estimated 170,000 - 200,000 new cases in US per year
*Incidence increasing, likely due to improvements in systemic therapy and greater use of MRI  
*On autopsy, ~10-30% of cancer patients have brain metastases
**Lung cancer 34%, breast cancer 30%, melanoma 72% {{ref|Posner}}
*Metastatic brain tumors 10x more common than primary brain tumors
*Single metastasis = only one lesion in the brain, regardless of extra-cranial status
*Solitary metastasis = CNS metastasis as the only site of disease

==Staging==
*No official staging system exists

==Prognostic Factors==
===Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA)===
*'''2009''' (1985-2007) PMID 19942357 -- &quot;Diagnosis-Specific Prognostic Factors, Indexes, and Treatment Outcomes for Patients with Newly Diagnosed Brain Metastases: A Multi-Institutional Analysis of 4,259 Patients.&quot; (Sperduto PW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Nov 24. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 4,259 patients from 11 institutions. Development of Diagnosis-Specific GPA (DS-GPA)
**Outcome: For NSCLC/SCLC need 4 prognostic factors (age, KPS, ECM, number of brain mets). For renal cell/melanoma need 2 prognostic factors (KPS/number of brain mets). For breast/GI need 1 prognostic factor (KPS)
**Conclusion: Significant prognostic factors varied by diagnosis.

*RPA validation study using RTOG 91-04 - PMID 10863071
*RPA does not predict survival with 4 or more brain metastases (Germany) - PMID 12540980


'''Number of Mets'''
*'''RTOG 7916''' PMID 8420868 -- ''CT characteristics of patients with brain metastases treated in RTOG study 79-16.'' (Swift PS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Jan 15;25(2):209-14.)
**Pre- and post-treatment CT analysis for prognostic factors
**Improved survival: &lt;=3 mets (especially for RPA Stage I patients)

==Natural history (no treatment)==
Duration of survival with symptomatic mets:
*without treatment - one month{{ref|2}}; 
*with steroids - two months{{ref|3}}. 


==Steroids==
*Corticosteroids should be used at onset for all symptomatic patients
*If stable, can start with 8mg BID dexamethasone (or equivalent)
*If whole brain RT, should receive steroids at least 48 hours before treatment to decrease chance of herniation (works well for weekend call)
*Two dosing schedules to consider
**start 8mg BID, begin taper during Week 2 of RT by 2-4mg every fifth day. If symptoms (tumor or steroid withdrawal), go back up a level for 4-8 days, then restart taper. If symptoms after steroids discontinued, restart full regimen (Posner JB, ''Neurologic Complications of Cancer'', Philadelphia: FA Davis, 1995:37, 77, 311)
**start 8mg BID x4 days, then 4mg BID x4 days, then 2mg BID until treatment completed (PMID 1726656)


*'''AANS/CNS; 2010''' PMID 19957014 -- &quot;The role of steroids in the management of brain metastases: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline.&quot; (Ryken TC, J Neurooncol. 2010 Jan;96(1):103-14. Epub 2009 Dec 3.)
**Asymptomatic patients: insufficient evidence
**Mild symptoms: dexamethasone 4-8 mg/day 
**Moderate/severe symptoms: dexamethasone 16 mg/day
**Duration: Slow taper over 2 week period or longer

==Seizures==
*Prophylaxis against seizures is not recommended.  
*A Meta-Analaysis showed lack of efficacy for seizure prophylaxis
**Mayo - PMID 15595331, 2004 &amp;mdash; &quot;Seizure prophylaxis in patients with brain tumors: a meta-analysis.&quot; Mayo Clin Proc. 2004 Dec;79(12):1489-94.
*2010 AANS/CNS Guidelines do not recommend routine prophylactic use of anticonvulsants (PMID 19957015)

==When to Treat?==
*Consider no RT if expected survival &lt; 30 days and KPS &lt;=60
*Expected median survival &lt;3 months
**prostate: hormone-resistant
**breast: failure of 3rd line chemotherapy
**lung: failure of 1st line chemotherapy
**colon: ascites or liver failure
**liver mets and doubling LFTs q month
**SVC syndrome
**hypercalcemia
**HIV with CD4 &lt;25 and RNA &gt;100K
**CHF Class IV with EF &lt;20%
**Creatinine &gt;8
**pO2 &lt;55 and pCO2 &gt;50


*'''Wisconsin, 2007''' PMID 17401015 -- &quot;Regression after whole-brain radiation therapy for brain metastases correlates with survival and improved neurocognitive function.&quot; (Li J, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 1;25(10):1260-6.)
**Subset analysis of PIII trial. 135 patients had evaluation of neurocognitive function. &quot;Good responders&quot; defined as tumor shrinkage &gt;45%, &quot;poor responders&quot; tumor shrinkage &lt;45% as a function of population mean
**Conclusion: Tumor shrinkage correlates with survival and neurocognitive preservation. Neurocognitive function stable/improved in long-term survivors. Tumor progression affects neurocognitive function more than WBRT

==Therapy==
*Whole brain RT, given in 30 Gy in 10 fractions, remains the generic standard treatment. However, for those with expected longer survival (&gt;6 months), neurocognitive sequelae can be severe with schedules &gt;=3 Gy/fx
*For patients with a single met, especially if their extra-cranial disease is controlled, local treatment (SRS or surgery) and WBRT provides survival benefit, as well as local control benefit
*The role of SRS alone has not yet been established
*For patients with multiple mets, the optimal management has not yet been established
*Algorithm for initial treatment of brain mets from PMID 17673619 (See Review below)
**If KPS &lt;70: ''WBRT''
**If KPS &gt;=70
***If active extracranial disease
****1 met: ''WBRT +/- SRS''
****2+ mets: ''WBRT''
***If controlled extracranial disease
****1 met: ''Surgery +/- WBRT'' or ''SRS +/- WBRT''
****2-3 mets: ''WBRT +/- Surgery'' or ''WBRT +/- SRS''
****&gt;3 mets: ''WBRT''

==Patterns of relapse==
*PMID 9614957, 1998 &amp;mdash; &quot;Patterns of relapse and late toxicity after resection and whole-brain radiotherapy for solitary brain metastases.&quot; Nieder C et al. Strahlenther Onkol. 1998 May;174(5):275-8.
**Retrospective. 66 pts treated with surgery -&gt; WBRT. Relapse 27% after 1 yr, 55% after 2 yrs. High local relapse rate for melanoma, non-breast adenoca, and squamous cell. Failure elsewhere in the brain was influnced by systemic disease activity. Size did not correlate with local failure.

==Reirradiation==
Usually with radiosurgery, but few pts may require reirradiation of the whole brain or partial brain. 8 Gy in 2 weeks to 30.6 Gy in 3 weeks. 

'''''Whole Brain Reirradiation:'''''

*'''1980: Rush Presbyterian (Chicago)''' PMID 7448697 -- &quot;Results of re-irradiation for cerebral metastases.&quot; (Kurup P, Cancer.  1980 Dec 15;46(12):2587-9.)
**56 pts. Retreatment dose 20 Gy / 10 fractions. Some pts received multiple re-treatments.
**Good response in 18 pts(32%), partial response in 24(42%). Median duration of response 2.5 months. Median survival 3.5 months.

*'''1988: Colorado''' PMID 2841266 -- &quot;Brain metastases: results and effects of re-irradiation.&quot; (Hazuka MB, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1988 Aug;15(2):433-7.)
**44 pts. Varying doses. Retreatment: median 25 Gy / 3.0 Gy per fraction (range: 6-36 Gy, 2-4 Gy/fx). 1st course: 30/10 (median). 
**Median survival 8 weeks. 27% showed partial neurological improvement; 55% failed to respond or had worsening function. Brain necrosis in 3 pts at autopsy.
**Conclusion: &quot;It is concluded that retreatment of brain metastases is seldom worthwhile. Survival is usually short and most importantly, the quality of survival frequently is not improved.&quot;

**52 pts. Retreatment: 25 Gy in 10 fractions. 1st course: 30/10.
**Neuro improvement in 42%. Survival 5 months. 

*'''1996: Mayo''' PMID 8621282 -- &quot;Analysis of outcome in patients reirradiated for brain metastases.&quot; (Wong WW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Feb 1;34(3):585-90.)
**86 pts. Varying doses. Retreatment: median 20 Gy / 10 fractions. 1st course: 30/10 (median).
**Neuro symptoms cleared in 27%, partially improved in 43%, 29% no change or worsened. Median survival 4 months. 

*'''2011: MGH''' (2002-2008) PMID 21620583 -- &quot;Outcomes After Whole Brain Reirradiation in Patients with Brain Metastases.&quot; (Son CH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 May 26. [Epub ahead of print])
**17 pts w/ brain mets treated initially with WBRT (median 35 Gy, 2.5 Gy/fx) and given whole brain reirradiation (median 21.6 Gy [range 14-30 Gy]; median 1.8 Gy/fx [range 1.5-2.0 Gy/fx]). 
**Of 10 pts w/ complete f/u information, 8 experienced complete or partial improvement in symptoms; 2 did not improve. Time to radiographic progression 5.2 months. Median OS (after initial diagnosis of brain mets) 24.7 mo. Median survival after reirradiation 5.2 mo. In 6 pts with stable extracranial disease, MS after re-RT 19.8 mo vs 2.5 mo with extracranial disease progression. Side effects mild to moderate
**Conclusion: reirradiation of brain mets may be appropriate in selected pts, especially those with controlled extracranial disease.



'''''Reirradiation after PCI:'''''
Reirradiation for subsequent brain metastases after prophylactic cranial irradiation

*'''Institut Gustave-Roussy''' (1985-93) - trials PCI85 and PCI88
**PMID 12075744, 2002 &amp;mdash; &quot;Patterns of failure after prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer: analysis of 505 randomized patients.&quot; (Arriagada R, Ann Oncol. 2002 May;13(5):748-54.)
**Analysis of two randomized trials (+/- PCI) looking at patterns of failure
**Overall 5-yr rates of brain metastases were 59% (PCI-) and 43% (PCI+). PCI dose was 24-30 Gy (with &lt;= 3Gy/fx); commonly 24 Gy (3Gy x 8) was used.
**Per protocol, patients developing brain metastases were treated with 50 Gy in 28 fractions if no prior PCI or 39 Gy in 22 fractions (approx 1.77 Gy/fx) if prior PCI.

*'''Wake Forest, 2007''' PMID 17869448 -- &quot;A Phase III, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial of d-threo-methylphenidate HCl in Brain Tumor Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy.&quot; (Butler JM Jr, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Sep 13; [Epub ahead of print])
**Randomized. 68 patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors. Arm 1) prophylactic d-MPH 5mg BID -&gt; 15mg BID vs. Arm 2) observation. Outcome measure QOL and cognitive function
**Outcome: No difference in fatigue, QOL, or cognitive function
**Conclusion: Prophylactic d-MPH not beneficial in brain tumor patients

*'''1989 MSKCC''' PMID 2725874 -- ''Radiation-induced dementia in patients cured of brain metastases.'' (DeAngelis LM, Neurology. 1989 Jun;39(6):789-96.)
**Retrospective. 12 patients with delayed complications of WBRT
**WBRT given: total dose only 25-39 Gy, but given in 3-6 Gy/fx
**Complications (median 14 months, 5-36 months): progressive dementia, ataxia, urinary incontinence causing severe disability; death in 7/12 patients (from side effects, not tumor recurrence). CT scan: cortical atrophy, radionecrotic lesions
**Conclusion: incidence of severe WBRT-induced dementia 2-5%. Fraction too high.

'''''Memantine'''''
*'''RTOG 0614, 2013''' PMID 23956241 -- &quot;Memantine for the prevention of cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving whole-brain radiotherapy: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.&quot; (Brown PD, Neuro Oncol 2013 Aug 16; [Epub ahead of print])
**Randomized. 554 patients treated for CNS metastatic disease with whole brain RT (3750 cGy at 250 cGy/fx) randomized to 1) Memantine during and after RT (total 24 weeks) or 2) placebo.
**Primary Outcome: Less decline in delayed recall with memantine but borderline statistical significance (p=0.059).  Probably related to loss of study power over time.  
**Secondary Outcomes: Time to cognitive failure improved with memantine (54% vs. 65% at 24 weeks; p=0.01).  No difference in PFS or OS.
**Toxicity: No difference.  28% grade 3-4, half of which was attributable to therapy (same in each arm).
**Conclusion: Patients treated with memantine had better cognitive function over time; specifically, memantine delayed time to cognitive decline and reduced the rate of decline in memory, executive function, and processing speed in patients receiving WBRT.  Primary endpoint not technically met, perhaps due to patient loss over time.

&lt;big&gt;'''Brain Metastases: Surgery'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Overview==
*'''AANS/CNS; 2010''' PMID 19960230 -- &quot;The role of surgical resection in the management of newly diagnosed brain metastases: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline.&quot; (Kalkanis SN, J Neurooncol. 2010 Jan;96(1):33-43. Epub 2009 Dec 4.)
**Recommendations apply to adults with newly diagnosed single brain metastasis amenable to surgical resection
**Surgical resection plus WBRT vs surgical resection alone
***(Level 1): Surgical resection followed by WBRT superior for local control and overall brain control
**Surgical resection plus WBRT vs SRS +/- WBRT
***(Level 2): Surgical resection plus WBRT and SRS plus WBRT both represent effective treatment strategies, resulting in relatively equal survival rates
***(Level 3): SRS alone may provide equivalent function and survival, so long as detection of distant sites of failure and salvage SRS are possible
**Surgical resection plus WBRT vs WBRT alone
***(Level 1): Surgical resection plus WBRT is superior to WBRT alone in patients with good performance status and limited extracranial disease. There is insufficient evidence for other patients

==WBRT +/- Surgery==
*Several retrospective series showed benefit of adding surgery to WBRT for single brain metastases
*Three randomized trials were performed; 2 showed benefit, while 1 showed no difference. 
*Overall, surgery + WBRT offers better local control, decreased recurrence, and probably improved survival over WBRT alone
*Survival outcomes are not improved with surgery for patients with active extra-cranial disease, or poor performance status


*'''Canada Multi-Institutional''' (1989-1993) -- WBRT 30/10 vs. Surgery + WBRT 30/10
**Randomized. 84 patients. Single brain metastasis, KPS &gt;50, no lymphoma/SCLC. Dexamethasone per institutional policy. Arm 1) WBRT 30/10 vs. Arm 2) Surgery + WBRT 30/10. Treatment within 3 weeks of CT scan.
**'''1996''' PMID 8839553 &amp;mdash; &quot;A randomized trial to assess the efficacy of surgery in addition to radiotherapy in patients with a single cerebral metastasis.&quot; (Mintz AH, Cancer. 1996 Oct 1;78(7):1470-6.) 
***Outcome: Median OS WBRT 6 months vs. surgery + WBRT 6 months (NS). No difference in QoL
***Conclusion: No benefit from adding surgery to whole brain RT
**Comment: Worse baseline KPS than Kentucky and Netherlands studies.

*'''University Hospital Leiden''' (Netherlands)(1985-90) -- WBRT 40/20 BID vs. Surgery + WBRT 40/20 BID
**Randomized. 63/66 patients. Single brain metastasis. Arm 1)  Pts randomized to resection + WBRT vs WBRT alone. XRT was to whole brain 2Gy BID for 40 Gy over 2 weeks. No MRI.
**'''1993''' PMID 8498838 &amp;mdash; &quot;Treatment of single brain metastasis: radiotherapy alone or combined with neurosurgery?&quot; (Vecht CJ, Ann Neurol. 1993 Jun;33(6):583-90.)
***Outcome: Stable extracranial disease: median OS 7 months vs. 12 months. Progressive extracranial disease: median OS 5 months both groups (NS). 
***Functional independence: Stable extracranial disease: 4 months vs. 9 months. Progressive extracranial disease: 2.5 months both groups (NS). More rapid and longer after surgery + RT
**'''1994''' PMID 8040016 &amp;mdash; &quot;The choice of treatment of single brain metastasis should be based on extracranial tumor activity and age.&quot;  (Noordijk EM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1994 Jul 1;29(4):711-7.)
***Outcome: median OS WBRT 6 months vs. surgery + WBRT 10 months (SS). Stable extracranial disease (7 months vs 12 months), active extracranial disease (5 months both groups). Age independent predictor (60 years). Majority of deaths due to systemic progression
***Conclusions: surgery and radiotherapy should be offered over radiotherapy alone. However, for patients with active extracranial disease, radiotherapy alone is sufficient.

*'''University of Kentucky / Patchell#1''' (1985-1988) -- WBRT 36/12 vs. Surgery + WBRT 36/12

**Prospective, non-randomized. Originally a randomized trial, but due to poor accrual was changed to a registry study. 80/97 patients. RT alone (n=55) and surgery + RT (n=25). 
**Outcome: Improved/stabilized function RT alone 59% vs. surgery + RT 79%. Recurrence 45% vs. 22%. Improved survival for surgery + RT when corrected for other factors
**Conclusion: Study suggests improvement in survival advantage for surgical resection

==Surgery +/- WBRT==
*'''Patchell study #2''', 1998 (1989-97) - PMID 9809728 &amp;mdash; &quot;Postoperative radiotherapy in the treatment of single metastases to the brain: a randomized trial.&quot; Patchell RA. JAMA. 1998 Nov 4;280(17):1485-9.  
**95 pts. Randomized. &lt;u&gt;Single&lt;/u&gt; brain met. Pts with complete resection (verified by MRI) randomized to postoperative whole brain RT or observation.  Dose was 50.4 Gy over 5.5 weeks. Allowed to have other sites of metastases, but KPS &gt;= 70%.
**Median f/u 43-48 wks. Postop RT was associated with less recurrence anywhere in the brain (18% vs 70%), at the site of resection (10% vs 46%), as well as other areas in the brain (14% vs 37%). Decreased neurologic death (6 of 43 pts, 14%; vs 17 of 39, 44%).  No difference in overall survival (unlike Patchell #1) or length of time patient remained independent.
**Criticism: non-standard whole brain RT dose

**Retrospective. 85 patients, surgery + postop SRS without adjuvant WBRT. The median marginal radiosurgery dose was 16 Gy, and median target volume was 13.96 cm.  
**Outcome: Median follow-up time was 11.2 months. Overall local control was 81.2%. The 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year rates of local control were 88.7%, 81.4%, and 75.7%, respectively. Median overall survival time was 12.1 months. From initial treatment until death or last follow-up, only 30 patients (35%) received WBRT as salvage treatment.
**Conclusion: Radiosurgery to the surgical cavity without WBRT achieved excellent local control of resected brain metastasis. Close imaging follow-up allows early intervention for any new metastasis.

&lt;big&gt;'''Whole Brain Radiation Therapy'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*30 Gy in 10 fractions considered standard treatment after RTOG 6901 
*Most commonly used for palliation, commonly defined as objective tumor response by CT or decrease in steroid dose
**Princess Margaret Hospital, 2001 - PMID 11578731 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiotherapy for brain metastases: defining palliative response.&quot;  Bezjak A et al. Radiother Oncol. 2001 Oct;61(1):71-6. 
***Seeks to determine the palliative response using performance status in patients with symptomatic brain mets.
*Median survival 4-7 months
*Routine use of WBRT now debated, since chemotherapy and SRS offer modest benefit with fewer neurological sequelae. Newer measurements of neurological sequelae done with before radiation show that tumor and not radiation possibly more likely to have caused sequelae previously thought to be from radiation (see PCI of small cell lung ca).


==History==
Have been doing palliative whole brain radiotherapy for a long time {{ref|1}}.


==Steroids +/- RT==
*'''ECOG''' -- prednisone +/- whole brain RT
**Randomized. 48 patients. Brain metastases (by radioisotope brain scan, EEG, echo, angiogram, of CSF studies), and histologically proven cancer. Extracranial disease status not considered. Arm 1) Prednisone 40 mg QD x 4 weeks, then 30 mg QD until disease progression vs. Arm 2) Prednisone 40 mg QD + whole brain RT 4000 r in 22-29 days. At the end, further randomized to +/- prednisone 30 mg daily. Clinical criteria used since imaging unreliable
**'''1971''' PMID 5541678 -- &quot;The management of metastases to the brain by irradiation and corticosteroids.&quot; (Horton J, Am J Roentgenol Radium Ther Nucl Med. 1971 Feb;111(2):334-6.)
***Outcome: Clinical &quot;remission&quot; prednisone 63% vs. prednisone + RT 61%; duration of remission 5 weeks vs. 11 weeks (wide range); median OS 10 weeks vs 14 weeks 
***Toxicity: Alopecia
***Conclusion: Combination of radiation and prednisone offers only a slight advantage over prednisone alone

==Dose and fractionation studies==
*Despite numerous studies testing numerous combinations of dose and fractionation, outcomes remain the same (and poor) as 30/10 established with RTOG 6901
*Representative regimens tried: 10/1, 12/2, 20/5, 30/6, 30/10, 35/15, 18/3 + 18/3 split, 37.5/15, 40/15, 50/20, 50/23, 54/34 BID


*'''Kogarah, Australia''' -- 40/20 BID vs 20/4 QD
**Randomized. 113 patients, brain mets, stable or absent extracranial disease, ECOG &lt;3. Surgical resection 36%. Arm 1) 40/20 BID vs. Arm 2) 20/4. Primary outcome intracranial control and QoL. 
**'''2009''' PMID 19836153 -- &quot;Randomized Comparison of Whole Brain Radiotherapy, 20 Gy in Four Daily Fractions Versus 40 Gy in 20 Twice-Daily Fractions, for Brain Metastases.&quot; (Graham PH, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Oct 14. [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: Median OS 40 Gy 6.1 months vs. 20 Gy 6.6 months (NS). Intracranial progression 44% vs. 64% (SS). Median time-to-CNS-progression 9 months vs 5 months (SS). Salvage RT/surgery 4% vs. 21% (SS). CNS death 32% vs. 52% (SS)
***Toxicity: Minimal. QoL clinically improved in 20 Gy arm over 40 Gy arm, but (NS).
***Conclusion: Intracranial control better with 40/20 BID than 20/4 QD; should be considered for better prognosis patients

&lt;big&gt;'''Brain Metastases: SRS'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Overview==
*WBRT alone and SRS alone have same OS and LC, but published as abstract only.
*WBRT + SRS showed KPS benefit overall, and OS benefit in single met compared to WBRT alone
*WBRT alone comparable to WBRT + SRS, in active extracranial disease (or poor performance status). Unclear if WBRT needed in controlled extracranial disease or if SRS is sufficient; retrospective evidence suggests worse outcome without it
*No published randomized trial of surgery vs. SRS alone for single met. Retrospective study suggests improved LC with SRS over surgery
*1 mm margin better than none


*'''AANS/CNS; 2010''' PMID 19960227 -- &quot;The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline.&quot; (Linskey ME, J Neurooncol. 2010 Jan;96(1):45-68. Epub 2009 Dec 4.)
**Target population: Adults, with lesions amenable to SRS (&lt;3 cm diameter, &lt;1 cm midline shift) and KPS &amp;ge; 70
**SRS + WBRT vs WBRT alone
***(Level 1): SRS + WBRT improved survival in single brain met
***(Level 2): SRS + WBRT improved local control and functional status in 1-4 brain mets
***(Level 3): SRS + WBRT may improve survival for patients with 2-3 brain mets
***(Level 4): SRS + WBRT may improve survival for patients with multiple mets and KPS &lt;70
**SRS + WBRT vs SRS alone
***(Level 2): SRS alone may provide equivalent survival; conflicting evidence of local and distal recurrence. Careful surveillance warranted
**Surgery + WBRT vs SRS +/- WBRT
***(Level 2): Surgery + WBRT vs SRS + WBRT both effective treatement strategies
***(Level 3): Surgery + WBRT vs SRS alone conflicting evidence
**SRS alone vs WBRT alone
***(Level 3): SRS alone appears superior for survival advantage

==Radiosurgery vs surgery==
*'''Cochrane Review, 2006''' PMID 16437498 -- &quot;Surgery versus radiosurgery for patients with a solitary brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer.&quot; (Fuentes R, Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2006 Jan 25;(1):CD004840.)
**No randomized trials. 686 references found, but none of sufficiently good quality for this review
**Conclusion: No meaningful conclusions can be drawn

*'''Mayo Clinic''', 2003 (1991-99) - PMID 12654423 &amp;mdash; &quot;A comparison of surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of solitary brain metastases.&quot; O'Neill BP et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2003 Apr 1;55(5):1169-76.
**Retrospective. 74 pts neurosurgery, 23 radiosurgery. Median f/u 20 mos. No difference in OS. 0% of RS pts had local recurrence vs 58% of NS group. 
**Improved local control for radiosurgery compared to neurosurgery.

==WBRT or Radiosurgery==
*'''Rhode Island Hospital / Brown University''' - &lt;u&gt;ASTRO abstract #7&lt;/u&gt; &amp;mdash; &quot;Randomized treatment of brain metastasis with gamma knife radiosurgery, whole brain radiotherapy or both.&quot; Chougule PB et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2000; 48(3 Suppl 1): 114.
**96 pts. 1-3 mets. No difference in median survival. Local brain control rate 87% (RS), 91% (RS+WBRT), vs 62% (WBRT). New brain lesions in 43% vs 19% vs 23%.
**51 pts had surgical resection of large, symptomatic lesions prior to randomization

*'''University of Cologne; 2004''' PMID 15127155 -  &quot;Linac radiosurgery versus whole brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. A survival comparison based on the RTOG recursive partitioning analysis.&quot; (Kocher M. Strahlenther Onkol. 2004 May;180(5):263-7.)
**Retrospective analysis with historical controls. 
**Group 1. 117 pts (1991-1998) with 1-3 mets receiving SRS alone. 22% had salvage therapy.
**Group 2. 138 pts (1978-1991) with 1-3 mets receiving WBRT. 7% had salvage therapy (WBRT)
**OS stratified by RPA Class.  
**RPA I	   - SRS: 25m  vs. 4.7m (very few pts)
**RPA II   - SRS: 5.9m vs. 4.1m (SS)
**RPA III  - SRS: 4.2m vs. 2.5m (NS)
**Conclusion: &quot;Radiosurgery in patients with one to three cerebral metastases results in a substantial survival benefit only in younger patients with a low systemic tumor burden when compared to WBRT alone. It cannot be excluded that this effect is partially caused by the available salvage options after radiosurgery.&quot;

==WBRT +/- Radiosurgery==
*One randomized trial (RTOG 95-08), suggests KPS benefit to WBRT + SRS, and survival benefit for 1 met. Patients RPA 2 with controlled extracranial disease


===Randomized===
*'''RTOG 95-08''' (1996-2001) -- WBRT vs WBRT + SRS
**Randomized. 331 patients, 1-3 brain mets with maximum diameter 4 cm, RPA class 1 (26%) or class 2 (74%), lung 63%. Arm 1) WBRT 37.5/15 vs Arm 2) WBRT + radiosurgery (24-18-15 Gy based on size) 
**'''2004''' PMID 15158627 [http://rtog.org/pdf_document/Lancet_Brain_Mets_Reprint.pdf Full text] &amp;mdash; &quot;Whole brain radiation therapy with or without stereotactic radiosurgery boost for patients with one to three brain metastases: phase III results of the RTOG 9508 randomised trial.&quot; (Andrews DW, Lancet. 2004 May 22;363(9422):1665-72.)
***Outcome: Mean OS WBRT 5.7 months vs WBRT+SRS 6.5 months (NS); single metastasis 4.9 months vs 6.5 months (SS) though (NS) on multivariate analysis. Higher 3-month response rate and control at 1 yr (71% vs 82%). No difference in overall time to progression (any intracranial failure) and no difference in neurologic death. Local recurrence 43% more likely with WBRT than WBRT+SRS. Improved KPS (4% vs 13%) and decreased steroid use at 6 months but no difference in mental status. 
***Toxicity: Acute G3+ WBRT 0% vs WBRT+SRS 3%; Late G3+ 3% vs 6%
***Conclusion: WBRT+SRS improved KPS, no difference in OS. Benefit in OS for single metastasis

*'''Pittsburgh''' -- WBRT vs WBRT + SRS
**Randomized. ''Trial stopped early after significant interim benefit in local control for WBRT+SRS arm''. 27 patients, 2-4 brain metastases &lt;2.5 cm, KPS &amp;ge; 70. Arm 1) WBRT 30/12 vs Arm 2) WBRT + SRS 16 Gy. Primary outcome brain control.
**'''1999''' PMID 10487566 &amp;mdash; &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole brain radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for patients with multiple brain metastases.&quot; Kondziolka D et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Sep 1;45(2):427-34. 
***Outcome: 1-year local failure WBRT 100% vs WBRT+SRS 8% (SS); time-to-failure 6 months vs 36 months (SS). Median OS WBRT 7.5 months vs WBRT+SRS 11 months (NS). However, patients in WBRT arm who received salvage SRS median OS 11 months (NS to WBRT+SRS), while patients who received only WBRT median OS 7 months (SS to WBRT+SRS)
***Conclusion: WBRT+SRS significantly improves control of brain disease; WBRT alone does not provide effective and lasting control

===Non-Randomized===
*'''Multi-institutional; 1996''' - PMID 8641923 -- &quot;A multiinstitutional outcome and prognostic factor analysis of radiosurgery for resectable single brain metastasis.&quot; (Auchter RM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Apr 1;35(1):27-35.)
**Multi-institutional retrospective. 122 patients, single resectable met, KPS &gt;=70. Median follow-up 31 months
**RT: WBRT (dose range 25-40 Gy, median 37.5 Gy) + SRS (dose range 10-27 Gy, median 17 Gy)
**Local control 86%, median survival 56 weeks, 1-year OS 53%
**Conclusion: WBRT + SRS is viable, should be tested in a randomized setting

*'''Multi-institutional; 2001''' (1988-98) - PMID 11567817 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiosurgery for patients with brain metastases: a multi-institutional analysis, stratified by the RTOG recursive partitioning analysis method.&quot; (Sanghavi SN et al, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Oct 1;51(2):426-34.)
**Retrospective, multi-institutional. 502 pts, WBRT + RS, stratified by RPA class I-III. Compared with historical controls receiving WBRT alone. Number of metastases not specified (but all metastases were treated with RS).
**Overall MS 10.7 months. Addition of RS boosted median survival (16.1, 10.3, and 8.7 for Class I, II, and III) vs WBRT alone (7.1, 4.2, and 2.3).
**Addition of RS may improve survival in selected pts. Benefit seen in all RPA classes.

==Radiosurgery +/- WBRT==
'''''Open trials:'''''
*'''NCCTG-N0574''' [http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCCTG-N0574 protocol link]
**Open trial by North Central Cancer Group and ACOSOG
**SRS +/- WBRT in patients with 1 to 3 cerebral metastases:
***Primary endpoint: overall survival
***Secondary endpoints: time to CNS (brain) failure, QOL/duration of functional independence/long-term neurocognitive status, post-treatment toxicity.

===Randomized===
*'''EORTC 22952-26001''' (1996-2007) -- Randomized, Surgery/SRS +/- WBRT
**Randomized. Pts with 1-3 mets &amp;le; 3.5 cm (&amp;le; 2.5 cm for 2-3 lesions), and no or stable systemic disease or asymptomatic primary tumors, PS 0-2. Treated with surgical resection (160) or SRS (199). Randomized to: adjuvant WBRT 30/10 or observation. Primary endpoint: PS deterioration to &gt;2.
**'''2009:''' [http://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016%2809%2901079-7/fulltext ASTRO Abstract #9] -- &quot;Adjuvant Whole Brain Radiotherapy vs. Observation after Radiosurgery or Surgical Resection of 1–3 Cerebral Metastases - Results of the EORTC 22952-26001 Study.&quot; (Kocher M)
***359 pts (353 elig.). Surgery for 160 pts (96% solitary), SRS for 185 pts (multiple in 33%). 
***Median time to PS progression: 10 months (obs) vs 9.5 (WBRT), no diff. Intracranial progression (@6 months and 24 months) 39.7% and 54.2% (obs) vs 15.2%/31.2% (WBRT). Reduction of local failure (31.3% vs 16.4%) and elsewhere intracranial failures (32.4% vs 17.6%). Neurological cause of death in 43% vs 25%.
***Conclusion: Adjuvant WBRT reduces the frequency of intracranial relapse at both initially treated and new sites and reduces the risk of neurologic death. However, it fails to prolong functional independence and overall survival.
**'''2011''' PMID 21041710 -- &quot;Adjuvant whole-brain radiotherapy versus observation after radiosurgery or surgical resection of one to three cerebral metastases: results of the EORTC 22952-26001 study.&quot; (Kocher M, J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jan 10;29(2):134-41.)
***Median time to PS progression (to &gt;2) 10 months (obs) vs 9.5 (WBRT), NS. Similar OS: 10.9 vs 10.7. WBRT reduced the 2 yr relapse rate at initial sites and new sites. Neuro cause of death in 44% vs 28%.
***Conclusion: &quot;After radiosurgery or surgery of a limited number of brain metastases, adjuvant WBRT reduces intracranial relapses and neurologic deaths but fails to improve the duration of functional independence and overall survival.&quot;


*'''MD Anderson''' (2001-2007) -- SRS vs SRS + WBRT
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to significantly worse cognitive outcome in WBRT+SRS arm.'' 58 of expected 90 patients. RPA I-II (KPS &gt;=70), 1-3 brain mets (57% single). Arm 1) SRS (dose per RTOG 9005; median 19 Gy) vs. Arm 2) SRS first (median 20 Gy) + WBRT 30/12. No concurrent chemo. Primary endpoint neurocognitive function using HVLT-R recall test at 4 months
**'''2009''' PMID 19801201 -- &quot;Neurocognition in patients with brain metastases treated with radiosurgery or radiosurgery plus whole-brain irradiation: a randomised controlled trial.&quot; (Chang EL, Lancet Oncol. 2009 Nov;10(11):1037-44. Epub 2009 Oct 2.). Median F/U 9 months
***Outcome: Significant decline in 4-month recall SRS 24% vs. SRS+WBRT 52% (SS). Functional brain assessment no difference. 1-year LC 67% vs. 100% (SS); 1-year distant brain control 45% vs. 73% (SS). 1-year CNS DFS 27% vs. 73% (SS). Median OS 15 months vs. 6 months (SS). Salvage much more aggressive in SRS only arm
***Toxicity: SRS 7% Grade 4. 
***Conclusion: Patients treated with SRS + WBRT were at greater risk of memory decline at 4 months. Recommend SRS as initial treatment

*'''Japan JROSG 99-1''' (1999-2003) -- SRS vs SRS + WBRT
**Randomized. ''Stopped early due to low likelihood of showing a difference.'' 132 of expected 188 patients. 1-4 mets, size &lt; 3cm. RPA I-II (85% RPA II). 50% active extracranial disease.  11 centers in Japan. Arm 1) SRS alone (dose if &lt;2cm 22-25 Gy, if 2-3cm 18-20 Gy) vs. Arm 2) WBRT 30/10 followed by SRS. SRS dose reduced by 30%. Primary endpoint OS
**'''2006''' PMID 16757720 &amp;mdash; &quot;Stereotactic Radiosurgery Plus Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy vs Stereotactic Radiosurgery Alone for Treatment of Brain Metastases: A Randomized Controlled Trial.&quot; (Aoyama H et al. JAMA 2006;295 2483-2491.)
***Outcome: Median OS SRS 8.0 months vs. SRS + WBRT 7.5 months (NS); 1-year OS 28% vs. 38% (NS); CNS death 19% vs. 23% (NS). 1-year LC ~75% vs. ~90% (SS); 1-year distant brain control 36% vs. 59% (SS). Decreased need for salvage brain treatment (10 pts vs 29 pts) with WBRT. No difference in neurocognitive measures
***Conclusion: SRS alone can be a reasonable strategy, with close monitoring and salvage retreatment

===Non-Randomized===
*'''Pittsburgh; 2005''' PMID 15803013 -- &quot;Radiosurgery with or without whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases: the patients' perspective regarding complications.&quot; (Kondziolka D, Am J Clin Oncol. 2005 Apr;28(2):173-9.)
**Retrospective. 200 patients treated with SRS +/- WBRT (69%). Patients perspective via questionnaires
**After WBRT: hair loss 88%, excess fatigue 95% (5% SRS), short term memory 72%, long-term memory 33%, concentration 61%, depression 54%. WBRT + SRS 63% thought they had side effects vs. SRS 34% (SS)

*'''Multi-institutional; 2002''' PMID 12062592 -- &quot;A multi-institutional review of radiosurgery alone vs. radiosurgery with whole brain radiotherapy as the initial management of brain metastases.&quot; (Sneed PK, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Jul 1;53(3):519-26.)
**Retrospective. 10 institutions. 569 patients (268 RS alone vs. 301 RS+WBRT)
**Median survival: no difference
**Conclusion: Omission of WBRT doesn't seem to compromise length of survival

*'''Heidelberg; 1998''' (Germany) PMID 9817276, 1998 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiosurgery alone or in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy for brain metastases.&quot;  Retrospective data from Pirzkall (JCO 1998) found no difference in survival in 236 pts treated with SRS versus SRS + WBRT, who had 1-3 brain metastases.  In subset of patients WITHOUT extracranial disease, omitting WBRT decreased median survival from 15.4 months to 8.3 months

==Radiosurgery alone==
*'''Freiburg; 2003''' (Germany) PMID 12699548, 2003 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiosurgery followed by planned observation in patients with one to three brain metastases.&quot; Lutterbach J et al. Neurosurgery. 2003 May;52(5):1066-73.
**101 pts. Up to 3 mets, 3 cm or less. 
**1-year brain failure free progression rate was 51%. RPA groups predicted survival

*'''Kentucky; 2002''' PMID 11872278, 2002 &amp;mdash; &quot; Risk  of symptomatic brain tumor recurrence and neurologic deficit after radiosurgery alone in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases: results and implications.&quot;  (Regine WF, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Feb 1;52(2):333-8.)
**Retrospective. 36 patients.
**Median OS: 9 months; symptomatic brain tumor recurrence 47% 
**Risk of symptomatic brain tumor recurrence after SRS alone: At 18 months, an 80% risk of relapse within the brain with SRS; and neurologic deficit-free survival drops to 50% at 12 months.  (stays stable at 18 months) 
**Conclusion: Use of primary SRS alone in this setting is associated with an increasingly significant risk of BTR with increasing survival time, as well as increasing neurological deficits

*'''RTOG 90-05''' (1990-1994) - dose escalation study
**156 pts. Recurrent primary brain tumors or recurrent brain metastases. Previously treated with RT. 
**First report (1996) - PMID 8621289 &amp;mdash; &quot;Radiosurgery for the treatment of previously irradiated recurrent primary brain tumors and brain metastases: initial report of radiation therapy oncology group protocol (90-05).&quot; Shaw E et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Feb 1;34(3):647-54. 
**Final report (2000) - PMID 10802351 &amp;mdash; &quot;Single dose radiosurgical treatment of recurrent previously irradiated primary brain tumors and brain metastases: final report of RTOG protocol 90-05.&quot; Shaw et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 May 1;47(2):291-8.
**Results: maximum tolerated doses were 24 Gy, 18 Gy, and 15 Gy for tumors &lt;/= 20 mm, 21-30 mm, and 31-40 mm. The MTD for tumors &lt;20 mm was actually not reached, but they did not increase the dose beyond 24 Gy. Incidence of radionecrosis 11% at 2 yrs. Grade 3-5 neurotoxicity associated with tumor size, tumor dose, and KPS. 


==For radioresistant tumors==
*'''ECOG E6397''' 2005 - PMID 16314647  &amp;mdash; &quot;Phase II trial of radiosurgery (RS) for 1 to 3 newly diagnosed brain metastases from renal cell, melanoma, and sarcoma: An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (E6397).&quot; Manon RR et al. 
**Melanoma, sarcoma, renal cell. Maximum of 4 cm tumor. 
**Stable disease in 32%, 42% with progressive disease.

==For 4 or more metastases==
*'''Pittsburgh; 2006''' (1995-2005) - PMID 16338097 &amp;mdash; &quot;Stereotactic radiosurgery for four or more intracranial metastases.&quot; Bhatnagar AK et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Mar 1;64(3):898-903.
**Retrospective. 205 pts treated with GKRS for 4 or more metastases in one session. Median number of lesions was 5. 17% had GKRS alone, 46% with WBRT, 38% for progression after WBRT.
**Median OS was 8 months. 1-yr LC was 71%. By RPA classificiation, median OS was 18 months (class I), 9 months (II), and 3 months (III). Total treatment volume, rather than number of lesions, was the most significant predictor of survival
**Conclusion: improved survival for pts treated with GKRS compared to historical controls by RPA classification in this retrospective study. Some pts with 4 or more lesions should be considered for GKRS.


==Brainstem lesions==
*'''UCSF; 2008''' (1991-2005) PMID 17628747 -- &quot;Gamma knife radiosurgery for brainstem metastases: the UCSF experience.&quot; (Kased N, J Neurooncol. 2008 Jan;86(2):195-205.)
**Retrospective. 42 pts (44 lesions: 7 midbrain, 31 pons, 6 medulla). Median target volume 0.26 cc; median tumor diameter 0.9 cm. Prescribed dose 16 Gy (50% isodose median). 
**Brainstem lesion FFP 90% at 6 months, 77% at 1 yr. 4 pts had brainstem complications. Poor brainstem outcome associated with melanoma and RCC histology and brainstem lesion volume &amp;ge; 1 mL. 
**Conclusion: SRS provided excellent local control with low morbidity

*'''Virginia; 2006''' (1989-2005) PMID 17219825 -- &quot;Gamma knife surgery for metastatic brainstem tumors.&quot; (Yen CP, J Neurosurg. 2006 Aug;105(2):213-9.)
**Retrospective. 53 patients (8 midbrain, 42 pons, 3 medulla). Mean volume 2.8 cm3 (0.05-21). Prescription dose mean 17.6 Gy (9-25). 37 patients with follow-up imaging
**Conclusion: GKS prolongs survival compared to observation; risks are low

*'''Marseille, 2006''' (France)(1992-2001) PMID 16385327 -- &quot;Brainstem metastases: management using gamma knife radiosurgery.&quot; (Fuentes S, Neurosurgery. 2006 Jan;58(1):37-42; discussion 37-42.)
**Retrospective. 28 patients (9 midbrain, 17 pons, medulla 2). Mean max diameter 17.2 mm (10-30). Mean dose 19.6 Gy (11-30)
**Conclusion: GKS valuable modality for safe and effective treatment

==SRS Margins==
*'''Maastricht, 2006''' PMID 16814946 -- &quot;A pathology-based substrate for target definition in radiosurgery of brain metastases.&quot; (Baumert BG, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Sep 1;66(1):187-94.)
**Retrospective. Autopsy of 45 patients
**Infiltration present in 48/76 mets (63%). SCLC and melanoma infiltration &gt;=1mm, other tumors &lt;1mm. NSCLC highest percentage of mets with infiltration (70%)
**Conclusion: Margin of ~1mm should be added to visible lesion

*'''Paris, 2003''' PMID 12885447 -- &quot;Radiosurgery for brain metastasis: impact of CTV on local control.&quot; (Noel G, Radiother Oncol. 2003 Jul;68(1):15-21.)
**Retrospective. 61 patients. Median KPS 80. 23 no progression of systemic, 38 progressive disease. RT 38 initial SRS, 23 relapse/progression after WBRT. Median f/u 10.5 months
**RT margins: 1994-1995 no margin, mean min GTV dose 14.6 Gy. 1995-2000 1 mm margin (GTV -&gt; CTV), mean min GTV dose 16.8 Gy
**2-year LC rate: 51% vs. 90% (SS), 8 recurrences vs. 2 recurrences (SS). Margin only multivariate predictor of LC
**No difference in OS, no difference in side effects


==SRS Technique==
*'''Toronto; 2007''' PMID 17852114 -- &quot;Fractionated (split dose) radiosurgery in patients with recurrent brain metastases: implications for survival.&quot; (Davey P, Br J Neurosurg. 2007 Aug 8;:1-5)
**Prospective. 2 SRS protocols, planning based on CT with contrast. 69 patients 2 fractions, 35 patients 1 fraction
**Outcome: Median OS fractionated 7.5 months vs. single fraction 4 months
**Conclusion: Fractionated SRS should be further investigated

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am an educator, network administrator, and self proclaimed woodworking hobbyist. My time is usually spent screwing around with network systems rather than doing any real woodworking but I have done a few projects. I have never had any formal training - nor any informal training in woodworking now that I think of it. But I do enjoy it.

My shop is one half of a two car garage with a 10in table saw, a band saw, drill press, router with table, bench sander, and assorted hand tools. I hope that I can contribute to the woodworking book as time permits and perhaps inspire others to step in and do a better job - to the benefit of all.</text>

==Invitation to re-discover the culture==

Each one is born into a specific culture.
Such culture is often characterized by one or more natural languages.
It may happen that one loses one's (original) culture due to emigration, either voluntary or forced.
It is often beneficial to become re-connected to that &quot;first&quot; culture.

In today's internet world, the re-discovery of one's culture is greatly facilitated.
This book addresses such re-discovery.

==Nature versus Culture==

The natural uncultivated world, the world without humans, is by definition the Nature.

The cultivated world, that part of the Nature which has been transformed by humans is what we will call in general, the Culture.

==Cultural heritage==

One's natural language is part of one's cultural heritage. In this context it is worth comparing with the rather narrow definition of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage Cultural heritage] as heritage.

Other key aspects of the culture include dance, song, music, art and so. Let us take a brief look at one of the great cultures of the world, that of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_India India].
There are so many things to take in. But one quickly identifies both space (geography) and time (history) to play a considerable role in the analysis. Specifically, that which constitutes the geography of India is very modern indeed. For insight
into such modernity of geography one might turn to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India history of India].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=The Play and Game=

In English «play» and «game» are two distinct words. Because of this, it is often the case that one is perplexed as to which comes first in the hierarchy of concepts. One test, with which we agree, is that applied by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huizinga,_Johan Huizinga], in his book [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens Homo Ludens]: all animals play; but do they all play games?

A Digital re-Discovery of Culture (DrDC) game
is one way in which one might find out where one fits within the world. In other words, to play the game to discover something about oneself and one's culture. In order to give some idea of what such a game might be like let us start with a movie: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9qpqyO_dmU Beowulf].

'''Let us imagine that you have now seen the movie?'''

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory backstory] (abbreviation for background story) is a very useful summary device to prepare the stage for the play (the game, the performance) that is about to begin.

There is a book with the title „The Play Ethic“.&lt;ref&gt;The subtitle of „The Play Ethic“ is „A Manifesto for a Diffeяent Way of Living&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;
Let us adopt the title to capture the spirit of the Ethics of Play.

==The Ethics of Play==
When we talk about play (or playing) we have in mind phrases such as “playing fair” or “fair play” and “playing foul” or “foul play”. Playing foul is usually associated with cheating. Both the words [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating “cheating”] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul “foul”] are interesting.

Let us distinuish between solitary play and communal play. Solitary play is playing alone. Communal playing is playing with others. It is in the latter context that playing foul and cheating take on significant meaning. So, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet cheat-sheet] for computer game is really a sort of investigation into the innards of the play.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Wikibook of The Analects of Confucius. 

==Objectives==
This book is to help students gain a deeper understanding of Chinese writing, philosophy and thinking through exposure to the sayings and dialogues of Confucius. The Analects was one of the compulsory texts for Chinese students studying for the imperial examinations of ancient China. A student's ability to write Chinese essays can be rapidly improved through such exposure.

==Structure of the Wikibook==
The Analects is presented in two forms, namely, simplified Chinese and Chinese pinyin (transliteration). The original text was written in traditional Chinese, but is now rendered in simplified Chinese, as it is widely used today. The Chinese pinyin form helps in the pronunciation and understanding of the text. The original text did not include pinyin, and since Chinese is not a phonetic language (i.e. not based on an alphabet), there is no guide to pronunciation in the source text. (Incidentally, there is also no punctuation in the original text.) Even simple words can have various pronunciations, as well as different associated meanings. For example, the word 乐 can be read as yuè (which means &quot;music&quot;) or lè (which means &quot;happiness&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/乐&lt;/ref&gt;. As many Chinese words sound alike, but are written differently with different meanings, homophones are used to evoke imagery or meanings that cannot be easily accessed otherwise.

==Prerequisites==
Knowledge of some basic Chinese characters before starting this course is preferred. If you do not have some knowledge of basic Chinese, an online or offline dictionary will be helpful.

On the other hand, this book can help those who can speak but not write Chinese. The pinyin form is spoken Chinese, rendered in an accessible phonetic form. The pinyin form can therefore help one to learn how to read and write Chinese, if one is already familiar with the spoken word.

==Introduction==

《论语》是孔子及其弟子言论的汇编，由孔子门生及再传弟子集录整理；是儒家的重要经典，是研究孔子及儒家思想尤其是原始儒家思想的主要资料。南宋时朱熹将《论语》、《孟子》、《大学》、《中庸》合为“四书”，使之在儒家经典中的地位日益提高。今本《论语》共计20篇，1.2万字。

The Analects (traditional Chinese: 論語; simplified Chinese: 论语; pinyin: Lún Yǔ), also known as the Analects of Confucius, are a record of the words and acts of the central Chinese thinker and philosopher Confucius and his disciples, as well as the discussions they held.

《论语》是孔子及其弟子言论的汇编，由孔子门生及再传弟子集录整理；是儒家的重要经典，是研究孔子及儒家思想尤其是原始儒家思想的主要资料。南宋时朱熹将《论语》、《孟子》、《大学》、《中庸》合为“四书”，使之在儒家经典中的地位日益提高。今本《论语》共计20篇，1.2万字。

The Analects (traditional Chinese: 論語; simplified Chinese: 论语; pinyin: Lún Yǔ), also known as the Analects of Confucius, are a record of the words and acts of the central Chinese thinker and philosopher Confucius and his disciples, as well as the discussions they held. It is the most important of all the confucian works and consists of 20 chapters and 12,000 characters.

《三字经》是中国的传统啟蒙书籍，初著傳說為宋朝王應麟，明清人多認定作者是王應麟。《三字经》以三字一句的方式，简短的叙述一些广为人知的历史故事和表述普遍为古代社会所接受的道德观念和哲理。

The Three Character Classic, Trimetric Classic or San Zi Jing (traditional Chinese: 三字經; simplified Chinese: 三字经) is one of the Chinese classic texts. It was probably written in the 13th century and attributed to Wang Yinglin (王應麟, 1223-1296) during the Song Dynasty.
The work is not one of the traditional six Confucian classics, but rather the embodiment of Confucian thought suitable for teaching young children. Until the latter part of the 19th century, it served as a child's first formal education at home. The text is written in triplets of characters for easy memorization.

翻译：

数星星的孩子
到了夜晚，满天的星星，看起来好像把无数的珍珠放在绿玉盘上一样。有一个
孩子在院子里靠着奶奶坐着，抬头仰望，指着天空数星星。他一个两个的，直
数到几百个星星。
奶奶笑着说：傻孩子，又开始数起星星来了，星星那么多，闪闪乱动，眼睛都
花了，你能数得完吗？孩子说：奶奶，要是看得见的话，就能数得完。星星虽
然移动并不是乱动。奶奶看，从这颗星星到那颗星星之间，仍然那么远。
爷爷走过来说，孩子，你的观察很仔细。天上的星星虽然移动，但他们之间的
距离，并不会改变。我们的祖先把他们分成一个一个的星座，还给了名号。爷
爷停了片刻，指着北方的天空说，你看，那七颗星星，连接起来，就像勺子一
样，他的名字叫做北斗星。离他不远的那一颗，名字叫做北极星。北斗星常常
绕着北极星旋转。爷爷说的话是真的吗？这个孩子一个没睡好，几次起来观察
星星。他果真轻轻楚楚的看见北斗星慢慢的绕着北极星旋转。
这个数星星的孩子，名叫张衡。是汉朝时候的人。他长大以后，因为专心研究
天文，成为著名的天文学家。

东郭先生牵了一只驴走在路上，驴驮着一个装了书的袋子。
忽然，有一只狼从后面跑过来，惊慌的说：先生救救我吧。猎人追我，快接近
了，我躲在你的袋子里吧。若能逃过这一次灾祸，我永远不会忘记你的恩情。
动过先生迟疑不决的停了下来，看到狼可怜的样子，心都软了，就答应了狼的
请求。他把袋子里的书倒出来，把狼装到袋子里，但是袋子毕竟不大，因为狼
的身体太长，这样装那样装，怎么样也装不下。
猎人越来越近，已经开始听到马跑的脚步声了，狼很着急的说：先生，请你快
一点吧，猎人一到来，我的命就要完了。说完就趴在地上，把他的身体缩成一
团，把头贴在尾巴上，并拢四条腿收合起来，让东郭先生捆绑。东郭先生把狼
绑好后，装在袋子里面，又装上书，把口袋紧紧的拴好后，照常驮在驴腰上，
继续向前走。
猎人追上后因为找不到狼，就问东郭先生说：你看到一只狼吗？他往哪个方向
跑了？东郭先生犹豫了一下说：我没看见狼，这里岔路很多，或者是从那一条
岔路逃走了吧。
猎人走了，越走越远了，马蹄声也听不见了。狼在袋子里说道：先生，我可以
出去了。说完后，东郭先生就把它放出来了。狼从袋子里出来后伸了一伸腰，
用舌头舔着口，向东郭先生说：先生，现在我的肚子很饿了，如果得不到东西
吃，我一定会饿死。先生既然救我，就把好事做到底，把你自己给我吃吧。话
还没说完，就向东郭先生扑了过去。
东郭先生很害怕，没有法子，只得绕着驴子躲避。他躲到驴的左边，狼就扑到
左边去；他躲到驴的右边，狼又扑到右边去。东郭先生累的不停的喘气，嘴里
只管骂着：你这没有良心的东西！你这没有良心的东西！
正在紧急的时候，有一个老农夫肩膀上扛着锄头走过来。东郭先生急忙走到前
面，抓住老农夫，把事情的经过都告诉他，说完后问道：我理应给狼吃吗？狼
还没等到老农夫回答，就赶紧说：刚才他捆绑我的腿，把我装到袋子里面，还
把这么多的书压在我的身上，把袋口牢牢的拴紧，这怎么可以说是救我呢？不
是很明显的想闷死我吗？这样的坏人不该吃吗？
老农夫想了一想说：你们的话，我一点儿也不相信。袋子那么小，能装得下一
只狼吗？我想看一看如何把狼装到袋子里。
狼同意了。它又卧倒在上缩成一团，把头贴在尾巴，把四腿并拢起来。东郭先
生照原来的样子用绳子把它捆绑，装在袋子里。东郭先生又正想把书装到袋子
里的时候，老农夫立刻赶前把袋口牢牢的拴上。他对东郭先生说：对狼行仁
慈，你太糊涂了啊！理应记取这个教训。他说完举起锄头把狼打死了。

《愚公移山》：
北山愚公，年九十，面山而居，恶其出入之不便，率其子孙，荷担执畚，欲平之。河曲智叟笑而止之曰：甚也矣。汝之不智也。以汝之残年余力，曾不能毁山之一毛。愚公曰：不然，我身虽死，有子存焉，子又生孙，孙又生子，子子孙孙，无穷匮也。而山不增加，何惧其不能平。

=Setting Up=
*Open css-lr300-idle.exp
{{NOTE|From now on you will be doing a lot of your own work. Animation methods will be taught throughout the rest of the animating pages.}}
==Finding the Length of the Animation==
*Find your ''default'' folder, which contains the decompiled default sg552.
*Open idle.smd in a text editor.
{{Info|Every time you decompile a Source model, the animations will have an extra frame at the end.}}
*Scroll to the bottom of the file.
*Now scroll up and find the nearest line that reads ''time #''.
*Subtract one from this number. The frame range for this animation is 0-15.

==Changing the Length of the Animation in XSI==
*Locate the timeline in XSI. It is near the bottom of the screen and has many numbers running across it.
*Look to the left of the timeline. There are two text boxes. Change them both to zero if they are not zero already.
*Look to the right of the timeline. There are two text boxes Change both of them to 15.

==Finding out the Frame Rate of the Animation==
*Locate the ''default'' folder and open ''mdldecompiler.qc'' in a text editor.
*Locate the line that beings by reading &quot;$sequence idle&quot;.
*Look at the end of the line. It should read ''fps 30.00''.
*The frame rate of this animation is 30 frames per second.

==Changing the Frame Rate of the Animation in XSI==
*Look at the bottom-middle of the XSI screen. There should be a darkened gray button that reads '''Playback'''. Click this button.
*Click ''Playback Options''.
*Under ''Precision'', change ''Format'' to ''Custom framerate''.
*Change ''Frame Rate'' to 30.
*Close the playback options window.

==Review==
{{NOTE|You should know how to..
*move and rotate objects by now using the 'Transform' panel.
*maximize and minimize viewports.
*change viewports (e.g. ''User'' to ''Camera'')
*navigate around the scene in all viewports.
*change the rendering mode of a viewport. (e.g. Textured Decal, Wireframe, Hidden Line Removal
*open up the schematic view of the scene. (Hint: Press 9)
*change the hierarchy of objects in the scene. (Hint: Use the ''Cut'' and ''Parent'' buttons on the right hand ''Constrain'' panel.
}}

==Navigating in the Schematic View==
*Open the schematic view.
*Press ''s'' to pan around the view.
*After pressing ''s'' click and drag with the middle mouse button to zoom in and out.
*Press ''a'' while the cursor is in the schematic view to frame the whole scene within the window. This also works in the viewports so if you ever get lost you can just press ''a''.
*To zoom in on a specific object, hold onto '''SHIFT+Z''' and click and drag a rectangle upon the area you wish to magnify.
*Press '''CONTROL+R''' to refresh the view. This is useful when changing the hierarchy of objects.
*The schematic view is handy for selecting objects.

=Posing=
{{Important|These animations must be done in positions of a left-handed person, unless you are animating any of the following: famas, galil, m249 }}
The idle animation is usually just a still position, but you can put a little animation in there if you want. For this tutorial we will make the idle animation a still position.
==Setting a Key==
{{Info|A key saves the parameters of an object to the timeline.}}
*Move the red frame marker to 0.
*Select a null, such as Bip01_L_Forearm, and, and move it near the grip of the LR-300.
*Press '''K'''.  This sets a key for the frame 0. To remove a key, press '''SHIFT+K'''.
{{Tip|The shortcut key for translating is '''V''', and the shortcut key for rotating is '''C'''. You must set keys for translation and rotation separately.}}
{{Tip|Bip01_L/R_Wrist are useful when rotating the arm.}}
*Now you are on your own for creating the pose.

==Aligning to the Camera View==
*Change one viewport to ''Camera'' and one to ''User''.
*Move the null ''ValveBiped.ValveBiped'' so it aligns with the camera well.

==Setting All Keys==
*Change the selection filter to Null.
*Press '''CTRL+A'''.
*Press '''VKCK''' to set all keys.

==Exporting==
*Go to ValveSource&gt;Export SMD.
*Check the first checkbox.
*Change the drop down list to &quot;Skeletal Animation (.SMD)&quot;.
*Save the file as idle.smd in your ''tocompile'' folder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Dairy|Dairy and eggs]]

[[Image:Raw egg.jpg|thumb|An egg yolk surrounded by the egg white]]
An '''egg yolk''' is the part of an egg which serves as the food source for the developing embryo inside.  Prior to fertilization the yolk together with the germinal disc is a single cell. Mammalian embryos live off their yolk until they implant on the wall of the uterus.  The egg yolk is suspended in the [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]] (known more formally as albumen or ovalbumin) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae.

The eggs used for culinary purposes generally come from birds (particularly poultry).  Chickens in particular are extensively farmed for their eggs.  Duck eggs are also sometimes used and are particularly suitable for use in baking cakes.

As a food, yolks are a major source of vitamins and minerals.  They also contain all of the egg's fat and cholesterol, and almost half of the protein.

If left intact while cooking fried eggs, the yellow yolk surrounded by a flat blob of egg white creates the distinctive sunny-side up form of the food.  Mixing the two components together before frying results in the pale yellow form found in [[Cookbook:Omelette|omelette]]s and [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scrambled eggs]].

==Uses==
[[Image:Yolks.jpg|thumb|Egg yolks as used in cooking]]
It is frequently [[Cookbook:Separating Eggs|separated]] from the egg white and used in many dishes such as:

* [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] 
*[[Cookbook:Custard|custard]]
*[[Cookbook:Hollandaise|hollandaise sauce]]
*[[Cookbook:Crème Brûlée|crème brûlée]]
*[[Cookbook:Avgolemono|avgolemono]]
*[[Cookbook:Ovos-moles|ovos-moles]]

*Egg yolk can be used to make liqueurs such as [[Cookbook:Advocaat|Advocaat]].</text>

'''Separating eggs''' is a process used in cooking, in which one removes the [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolk]] from the [[Cookbook:Egg White|egg white]] in order to use them separately which is required in many recipes such as meringues, sponge-cakes, mousses, mousselines and mayonnaise, among many others.

===Whisking=== 
Many recipes require frothing egg whites to make a foam, which will not work if the yolk is also included, as fat prevents eggs from foaming. Since egg yolks are high in fat, it is best to separate them before whisking. However, some recipes, such as genoise and zabaglione do include the yolk in the whisking procedure, but it is not possible to incorporate as much air and therefore to achieve as much volume.

== Methods ==
All methods for separating eggs make use of the fact that the yolk can hold itself together while the white is much more runny.  Since older eggs have more watery yolks which make separation difficult, it is a good idea to begin with the freshest eggs available.  Old eggs can be used for other dishes that do not require separation, like omelettes.

An egg is fresh if it lies flat at the bottom of a glass of water. It is old if it floats.

It is easier to separate eggs immediately after removing them from the refrigerator. If the recipe calls for room temperature eggs, which allows for more volume, separate them immediately and then let them sit at room temperature for about thirty minutes.

* Break the egg and use your fingers to strain out the yolk, while the whites run into the bowl below.  This is very quick but messy.
 
* Crack the egg in half and cradle the yolk in one half of the shell (using the other half of the shell to keep it from slipping out) while draining the white into a bowl.  If some white is left with the yolk, carefully pass the yolk back and forth between halves until it is all drained, being sure not to break the yolk on the sharp edges of the shell. Then deposit the yolk into another bowl.

* Break the egg on to a plate, and trap the yolk under a glass. Carefully, drain off the whites, lifting the glass slightly.

* Use a needle to pierce the egg and run the whites out, leaving the yolk inside.

* Break the egg into a [[Cookbook:Funnel|funnel]], thus capturing the yolk.

Specialized tools are also available for this process. See: [[Cookbook:Egg Separator|Egg Separator]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''College Preparation vs. Vocational Education'''
'''By: Cassaundra Lewis'''

==I. Introduction==
Every year thousands of students graduate from high school and go on to college. Every year hundreds are not as successful. What can be done to assure that more high school students go on to college? What can we do to prepare students for life after high school?  The United States has been debating these questions not only on state levels, but national as well. In this article I will discuss some of the benefits, hindrances, advances, and the content of vocational education and college preparation courses.
==II. College Prep vs. Vocational Education==
First we should define college preparation and vocational education. College preparation is a course or series of courses that help students adjust to many college-level requirements. William Tierney writes, “Important objectives of most programs are the smoothing of the transition from school to college, improvement of study habits, increase of general academic readiness, and expansion of academic options” (Increasing Access to College, 2002, pg 3). Vocational education is a course or series of courses that give students work related experience to express the nature of careers and help them learn skills that will assist towards careers in the future. According to Unger, “the basic purpose of vocational education is to get a job” (But What If…, 2006, pg 33). “In no other area has greater emphasis been placed upon the development of curricula that are relevant in terms of student and community needs and substantive outcomes.” (Curriculum Development, 1999, pg 3).

border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Did You Know…?

Did you know…

Education for work began 4,000 years ago? According to Finch, “(the) earliest type of vocational education took the form of apprenticeship” (Curriculum Development, 1999, pg 4).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==III. Main Targets of College Prep and Vocational Education==
One of the main targets of college preparation courses are low-income students and minorities, who make up a very small percentage of students attending both two and four year colleges directly after high school (Preparing for College, 2005, pg 3). “Educational institutions, state and federal governments, and local communities have committed significant resources to the development of a wide array of outreach activities designed to identify and assist underrepresented students in their pathways to college” (Preparing for College, 2005, pg 1). Vocational education targets those who are even less likely to attend college immediately after high school. “Millions of students all over the world are not suited for and have no interest in traditional academic schooling—which is why alternative career education was developed: to teach students the skills they need to get a good job” (But What If…, 2006, pg 4). Both college prep and vocational education attempt to enlighten students about career choices and assist them with the transition from high school into the adult world.
==IV. Positives and Negatives in College Preparation==
According to Anne Lewis, of the Education Digest, “more students are taking upper-level math and science classes and more are enrolled in Advanced Placement classes” (College Prep, 2004, paragraph 1). By this, she means that more students are enrolled in classes to help them prepare for college. She goes on to state, unfortunately, “the likelihood of ninth-graders completing high school and enrolling in college by age 19 (…, having graduated from high school within four years and directly entered a higher education institution) has declined”(paragraph 2). Another major negative in college preparation is that the population targeted is not always the one assisted. Tierney writes, “Programs such as MESA, Upward Bound, AVID, (etc.)… are well intentioned, (but) minority students remain underrepresented on college campuses”(Preparing for College, 2005, pg 1).
&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Did You Know…?

Did you know…

The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education grades each state, on a scale of A to F, on ability to effectively prepare students for college? Seven states received an “A,” Connecticut, Colorado, Massachusetts (who scored the highest), Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Utah. Louisiana and New Mexico were the only states to receive a “F”(College Prep, 2004, paragraph 7).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==V. Positives and Negatives in Vocational Education==
There are many benefits of vocational education. According to Unger, “Employers generally respect the credentials of graduates from vo-tech schools, which usually have strong job placement services and close ties with employers. Vo-tech students emerge stronger in academics as well, because students learn English, math, science, and other subjects in conjunction with their vocational education and, therefore, find these areas more interesting”(But What If…?, 2006, pg 20). Two negatives associated with vocational education are that, “Unfortunately, there are only about 325 vo-tech schools across the United States” and there is a rising inability to keep students interested (But What If…?, 2006, pg 20).

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
Did You Know…?

Did you know…

“It’s easy to get into college, but not easy to finish and graduate? More than 40% of students who enroll in American colleges and universities quit without graduating” (But What If…, 2006, pg 3).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

==VI. Curriculum Content==
What all is included in the curriculum for college preparation and vocational education? What factors help in considering whether or not a program should be added or subtracted? “Curriculum materials are resources that, if used properly, can assist an instructor in bringing about an intended desirable behavior change in individual students” (Curriculum Development, 1999, pg 208). Unfortunately, there is no fool proof way of being able to tell what is going to help and what isn’t. There are many things to take into consideration when choosing what programs to keep and eliminate (Increasing Access to College, 2002, pg 3). As far as college preparation is concerned, a lot of the learning occurs in advanced classes. Many different approaches are used, such as computer-based assessment and writing assessment. With vocational education, you must determine: What will the student want to study? What does the community need as far as work experience? What will motivate the students toward life after high school (Curriculum Development, 1999, pg 92)?
==VII. My Personal Experience with College Preparation and Vocational Education==
While I was in high school, I was fortunate enough to experience both college preparation and vocational education. In my opinion, college preparation did very much to help me familiarize myself with what college would actually be like. I attended all honors classes and college preparation meetings. During my time as a vocational education student, I had hands on job training and was able to get my license as a cosmetologist when I graduated from high school. Vocational education did just as much for me on an overall level as college preparation. I do understand that not everyone was as fortunate as I and may not have had the same type of support that I received. One contributing factor, that is very often overlooked, is the influence of home life on attending college directly after high school.
==VIII. Conclusion==
In conclusion, college preparation courses and vocational education courses are both designed to promote success in the community but use different avenues. College preparation is focused on getting students to college. Vocational education is focused on providing an alternative to a college education for those who might not be as interested capable. When used properly and effectively, these means of education can provide options after high school for all students.

《道德经》，又称《道德真经》、《老子》、《五千言》，是中国古代先秦诸子分家前的一部著作，为其时诸子所共仰，传说是春秋时期的老子李耳（似是作者、注释者、传抄者的集合体）所撰写，是道家哲学思想的重要来源。

道德经分上下两篇，原文上篇《德经》、下篇《道经》，不分章，后改为《道经》在前，《德经》在后，并分为81章。是中国历史上首部完整的哲学著作。现在可以看到的最初的版本，是1993年湖北荆门郭店楚墓出土的竹简《老子》。1973年长沙马王堆3号汉墓出土的甲乙两种帛书《老子》，是西汉初年的版本，把《德经》放在《道经》之前，也受到学者的重视。

《道德經》常會被歸屬為道教學說。其實哲學上的道家，和宗教上的道教，是不能混為一談的，但《道德經》作為道教基本教義的重要構成之一，被道教視為重要經典，其作者老子也被道教視為至上的三清尊神之一道德天尊的化身，又稱太上老君，所以應該說道教吸納了道家思想，道家思想完善了道教。同时，前面所说的哲学，并不能涵括《道德经》（修身立命、治国安邦、出世入世）的全貌。



The Tao Te Ching or Dao De Jing (traditional Chinese: 道德經; simplified Chinese: 道德经; pinyin: Dàodéjīng), is a Chinese classic text whose authorship is attributed to [[w:Lao Zi|Laozi]] or Lao tzu (Chinese: 老子; pinyin: Lǎozǐ). Its name comes from the opening words of its two sections: 道 dào &quot;way,&quot; Chapter 1, and 德 dé &quot;virtue,&quot; Chapter 38, plus 經 jīng &quot;classic.&quot; According to tradition, it was written around the 6th century BC by the Taoist sage Laozi (&quot;Old Master&quot;), an official in the imperial archives at the Zhou Dynasty court. The text's true authorship and date of composition or compilation are still debated. The received Tao Te Ching is a short text of around 5,000 Chinese characters in 81 brief chapters or sections (章). 


The Tao Te Ching is fundamental to the Taoist school (Dàojiā 道家) of Chinese philosophy and strongly influenced other schools, such as Legalism and Neo-Confucianism. This ancient book is also central in Chinese religion, not only for Taoism (Dàojiāo 道教) but Chinese Buddhism, which when first introduced into China was largely interpreted through the use of Taoist words and concepts. Many Chinese artists, including poets, painters, calligraphers, and even gardeners have used the Tao Te Ching as a source of inspiration. Its influence has also spread widely outside East Asia, aided by hundreds of translations into Western languages.

== Bezier curves ==

You wanted curved lines? Well here is how to get them, using [[wikipedia:B%C3%A9zier_curve|Bezier curves]].

*First start a new Blender project, and delete the default cube.[[Image:New_Bezier_Curve.png|right|thumb|300px|It should look like this.]]
*Press: 'SPACE - Add - Curve - Bezier Curve' to create a new curve.

As you can see, there is a black, curvy curve on your screen, inside what looks like a normal mesh (purple). Well you wouldn't be far wrong with that interpretation, because that is effectively what a Bezier curve is!

*Try selecting the vertices and moving them as we have done previously. You should notice they behave much like a normal mesh does, but with a few important differences. Firstly, there are two types of point here, a 'control' point, and a 'handle' point. The control points define where each section of  the curve has to start and finish, while the two pink handles help guide the curve between them.

By now you should have discovered you can drag the points around using the '''GKEY''', and that the handles are fixed in position relative to their control point. This is not the only maneuvre however, so here is a list of things you can do to the curve to modify it:

#'''Grabbing''': You can drag the points around separately or in groups.
#'''Rotating''': Using the '''RKEY''', you can rotate a control point around with your mouse. This is different from a mesh, as rotating the control point will move its handles too.
#'''Scaling''': Using the '''SKEY''', you can scale either an individual handle, or a whole control point at once. This changes how strongly a handle influences the curve's shape, not its direction.

Whatever you do to the defining points, Blender calculates the curve so it flows smoothly from one end to the other. When you leave Edit mode, only the black curve will remain visible, so don't worry about your control points getting cluttered!

== Extending your curve ==

So far your curve has only two control points, but in order to build up more complex shapes you will need to add many more! There are quite a few ways to do this, but lets start with the basics:

*'''Extruding''': Much like a mesh, you can use '''EKEY''' to extrude one end of your curve with a new control point. Select an end control point (not a handle, this will cause you a few problems) and press '''EKEY''', then '''LMB''' when it is in the correct location. The new point will have an exact copy of the handles of your old point, so you will have to rotate and adjust it accordingly.
*Note you can use '''CTRL+LMB''' to achieve the same effect.


*'''Subdividing''': Instead of adding onto the end of you curve, you can also split up sections of it into more control points, and here's how:

#Select two adjacent control points using '''RMB'''.
#Press the '''WKEY''', and select '''Subdivide''' from the popup menu.

*The segment should now have a new control point mid-way between the first two, that sits exactly on the curve that already existed. Now you can add more shape to this section using the new point.


== Filling your curve ==

So far we have been working with a continuous curve, with a definite beginning and end. But what you can do is turn this wiggly line into a wiggly shape.

*Select any part of the curve in Edit mode, and press the '''CKEY'''. This will connect your last control point back to the first, and fill in the shape.

*If you cannot see any fill, you are probably in wire-frame mode. Press the '''ZKEY''' to recover.

*If you have weird results, say fill leaking out from the curve or empty sections, you have probably got a couple of parts of the curve crossing themselves. '''Curve sections should never cross if you are making them into a filled shape!'''


== Handle types ==

Thus far with curves, whenever you move a handle around its partner will move too to make the curve flow smoothly through the control point. This is not the only way to do things however, so here is a list of the different things you can set them to do:

#'''Linked rotation''' (Pink handles): Both handles always point in opposite directions. This leads to a smooth curve.
#'''Free rotation''' (Black handles): The handles can be moved independently of each other, you can form corners and sharp bends in the curve. Switch between these two modes using '''HKEY'''.
#'''Automatic''' (Yellow handles): The handles are linked in rotation, and automatically rotate and scale to form the nicest (mathematically speaking) smooth curve through your points. Use '''SHIFT+HKEY''' to switch to this mode. If you try to move a handle, both will default back to Linked rotation.
#'''Vector''' (Green handles): The handles act as vectors, with each pointing directly towards the next control point. This leads to completely straight edges, so you can construct polygons. The hotkey is '''VKEY'''. If you move a vector handle, it will default to Free rotation, but the other will stay as a vector.

*Note, each handle from a control point can be assigned a separate type independently (excluding Auto). Just select only the handle vertex instead of the control vertex.


== Combining curves ==

As well as having one single filling curve in your object, you can combine several unconnected curves to create more complex shapes.

#Firstly create a filled shape, as described earlier.
#Now, stay in Edit mode and 'SPACE - Add - Curve - Bezier Curve' to create a new curve on top of your existing one.
#Manipulate the new curve so it fits inside the larger shape somehow, this will not work if the lines intersect.
#Making sure only the new curve is selected, fill it with '''CKEY'''.

You should see that the space enclosed by the inner curve is no longer filled. You can continue by adding more curves inside a larger one, or even a larger one around them all.


== Extruding ==

You may have noticed you can only modify the curve in two dimensions, and now its time to explore the third dimension! Extruding is where you define a two dimensional 'profile' shape, and it is 'swept' through space to create a volume.


=== Simple Extrude ===

If you want to make your curve 3d, the fastest way is to use the extrude slider. This simply extends your curve backwards by the specified distance to make a 3d object.

*'''Make a curve and fill it''': Use the steps above to create something simple, and fill it in using '''CKEY'''.
[[Image:Face_Bezier_Curve.png|400px]]

*'''Set the extrude depth''': Find the 'Curves and Surfaces' box in the Editing tab of the Buttons window. There is a slider on the right hand side called Extrude. Set the Extrude depth to something other than 0, and probably less than 1.
[[Image:Curve_and_Surface_Box.png|right]]

[[Image:Face_Bezier_Curve_Extruded.png|400px]]

Behold, your 2d curve has transformed into a neat 3d structure. The great thing is, you can still edit the curve as if it were just 2d, and the changes will update in real time.


==== Bevel ====

Now you have an extruded shape, you should start playing around with some of the other curve settings on offer, so here is a description of how the Bevel depth and Bevel resolution sliders work.

Try setting the Bevel depth to a small value, say 0.02. This will cut off all of the sharp edges, and give a bevelled effect all around the shape.

[[Image:Bezier_Face_Bevel.png|400px]]

As you may guess, Bevel resolution decides how many times the algorithm divides up an edge. Higher values than 0 result in smooth curves rather than sharp edges, but dramatically increase the number of vertices in the shape.

Try setting the resolution to 3 or 4, you should see an effect like this:

[[Image:Bezier_Face_Bevel_4.png|400px]]


=== Bevel Objects ===

''[Noob: I couldn't understand what this topic was supposed to do. Could someone explain better and include images? Thanks...][2ND NOOB: I couldn't understand this either.  Heck, I don't even have a typable feild in 'Curve and Surface'... Help on this section would be extremely useful...]''

This technique allows for much more sophisticated extending of our curves into 3d. Basically, we can create a new curve which will be extruded all the way around our main shape.

#'''Create a curve''': Once again, make a filled shape like our friend the smiley.
#'''Create a bevel object''': Add a new curve and return to Edit mode, leaving it as the default shape.
#'''Assign the bevel to the curve''': Type the name of the second curve (Default is Curve.001, or just Curve if you used a circle before) into the relevant box in the 'Curve and Surface' menu.


'''DON'T PANIC''' if you end up with a useless mess! This is expected, as we have yet to understand how the bevel object works.


Basically, the curve we created as a Bevel object is used to define the shape of the edge around our filled shape.

*The height of each part of the Bevel object above or below the local X axis is how far in front or behind the filled shape to extrude from the flat curve.
*The distance to the left or right on the local Y axis is how far towards or away from the center of the shape to pull each bit of the curve.

For our purposes, we want very little variation in the width of the bevel. This will hopefully solve the problem of all sorts of bits of the shape overlapping each other.

The default curve also starts and stops on the x-axis, we want to move the start and end points so one is higher than the other. (Preferably either side of the x-axis too, we don't want the extruded shape too far away from its curve).

Assuming you have kept the default new curve for your bevel object:

#Move the left-most point down a whole large grid-square, and right until it is two or three small squares from the main axes.
#Move the other point up a whole grid square, and left until it is roughly on the blue center-line.
#Modify the control handles if you feel it's necessary.

This should leave your shape looking nice and neat, extruded quite a long way with a smooth curving edge. Experiment with the shape, see what works and what doesn't!


*NB: The sliders for Extrude, Bevel depth and Bevel resolution are not used once a bevel object is in place.

(To come: Closed shape Bevel Objects)

=== Front and Back ===

When we have used the '''CKEY''' to connect the two ends of a curve together, as expected it also fills the curve with a solid shape. Now we are in 3d, however, we will sometimes want only the sides of the shape, not the filled faces on either side. Note that this only works on extruded shapes, flat curves don't really have a front or back do they?

#'''Create a filled, extruded shape''': Follow the process above, for speed just use an extrude depth.
#'''Disable Front and Back''': Click both 'Front' and 'Back' in the 'Curve and Surface' menu to disable them.

Now you should be able to see right through the curve! Cool isn't it.

*NB: You can disable just one of the faces and leave the other intact if you like.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Stick Method ==

Hi Geoff,

I use a different &quot;stick method&quot; that is a bit less of a waste of time.  Basically, I drive a stick in the ground and point it directly at the sun, making its shadow disappear.  In 15 minutes, the shadow will point kinda-sorta east, regardless of which hemisphere you're in.

Not as good as the watch method, but still good enough to give you a general idea.  If you have 15 minutes.

I have also messed around with using the watch method with the moon instead of the sun.  It works pretty much the same if the moon is full, but there are some major adjustments necessary when it's not full, and it's really easy to get confused.  The only reason to use the moon at night instead of the stars, is because on a cloudy night, you can sometimes still see the moon through the clouds.

For what it's worth! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 03:20, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter, we will more formally discuss the bra &lt;math&gt;|\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and ket &lt;math&gt;\langle |&lt;/math&gt; notation introduced in the previous chapter.

==Projections==
===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a Hilbert space and let &lt;math&gt;\ell:\mathcal{H}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous linear transformation. Then &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''linear functional''' on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt;.

The space of all linear functionals on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^*&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}^*&lt;/math&gt; is a ''normed'' vector space on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\|\ell\|=\sup\left\{\frac{|\ell(x)|}{\|x\|}:x\in\mathcal{H}; \|x\|\neq 0\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

We also have the obvious definition, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''orthogonal''' if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=0&lt;/math&gt;. We write this as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\perp\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;A\subset\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; then we write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\perp A&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}\perp\mathbf{a}\forall\mathbf{a}\in A&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a Hilbert space, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; be a closed subspace of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}^{\perp}=\{x\in\mathcal{H}:(x\cdot a)=0\forall a\in\mathcal{M}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, every &lt;math&gt;z\in\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; can be written &lt;math&gt;z=x+y&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;x\in\mathcal{M},y\in\mathcal{M}^{\perp}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof'''


==Reisz representation theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}&lt;/math&gt; be a Hilbert space. Then, every &lt;math&gt;\ell\in\mathcal{H}^*&lt;/math&gt; (that is &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is a linear functional) can be expressed as an inner product.

Does not lojban lack the distinction?  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:83.108.161.88|83.108.161.88]] ([[User talk:83.108.161.88|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/83.108.161.88|contribs]]) 13:10, 23 August 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:There seem to be several different routes to destroying the distinction, actually.  Replace both with predicates (but name words are a flaw in this, aren't they?).  Omit verbs, as in AllNoun or Kēlen.  Polysynthesis, as described here; the example that springs to my mind is Qþyn|gài.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 12:47, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

== Tagalog??? ==

Actually, Tagalog and several of its related languages lack this distinction. The core vocabulary in Tagalog consists of 1. function words or &quot;full words&quot;, and 2. grammatical words or particles. The function words can generally alternate between nominal, verbal, adjectival and adverbial functions. Bloomfield wrote in 1933, &quot;In Tagalog, the parts of speech are, again, full word and particle, but here the full words are subdivided into two classes which we may call static and transient. The latter ''resemble our verbs'' in forming a special kind of predicate (the narrative type with four subtypes, Sec. 11.2) and in showing morphologic distinctions of tense and mode, but they differ from our verbs because, on the one hand, they are not restricted to the function of predicate and, on the other hand, there exist non-narrative predicates.&quot; (Italics added by Paz Buenavista Naylor in &quot;Subject, Topic and Tagalog Syntax&quot; 1995 in ''Subject, Voice and Ergativity'', ed. David C. Bennett, et al.)</text>

'''Onion powder''' is made from finely ground dehydrated [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]s, mainly the pungent varieties of bulb onions, which causes the powder to have a very strong smell.

Onion powder comes in a few varieties:
*White onion powder
*Red onion powder
*Yellow onion powder
*Toasted onion powder

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

'''''Sauce velouté''''', takes its name from the adjectival form of the French word ''velour'', meaning velvet. In some older English cookbooks it is called ''velvet sauce''. It is one of the four &quot;Mother Sauces&quot; of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cuisine]].

===Ingredients===

* ¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (4 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tbs.]]) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* ¼ cup (60g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 2 cups (480ml) boiling [[Cookbook:White stock|white stock]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], to taste
* white pepper, to taste


===Procedure===
# Make a white [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]]: melt the butter in a sauce pan over low heat until the foam subsides.  Blend in the flour and cook slowly, while stirring until the mixture froths up for about 2 minutes. The flour should lose its raw smell, but should not colour.
# Remove from the heat.  When the ''roux'' has stopped bubbling, add the boiling stock all at once,  while whisking quickly but smoothly to create a smooth mixture. 
# Add the seasonings and cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Simmer the sauce until it lightly coats the back of a spoon.
# Taste and adjust seasonings.

===Notes===
*If sauce is lumpy: Force the sauce through a fine sieve or process it in a blender.
* If sauce is too thick: Thin it out with stock.
*If sauce is too thin: Bring the sauce to a boil. Off the heat, blend in a ½ tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Beurre manié|''beurre manié'']] with a wire whisk. Boil for 1 minute, stirring.

==Ship Resistance==
===Introduction===
A ship differs from any other large engineering structure in that – in addition to its other functions –it must be designed to move efficiently through water with a minimum of external force. 

It is found that the resistance, depends on the velocity of the ship. Therefore, resistance is always specified at a particular velocity. Furthermore, intuitively we understand that resistance will depend on the condition of the sea. We cannot expect that resistance in a rough sea is the same as in a calm sea. Therefore, operating conditions must also be specified. Therefore, Ship resistance is defined as the force required to tow the ship in calm water at a constant velocity.

Why is knowing resistance of a ship so important? The answer comes from knowing that the ship is usually a part of a larger transportation system. For the overall transportation system to be efficient, it is required that ships operate at a specified &quot;optimum speed&quot;. This speed is usually communicated to the naval architect, who must design the ship, so that this speed is attained. One way to ensure this is to put a very powerful engine in the ship, so for all possible values of resistance, the ship will be able to run at the optimum speed. 

This solution is clearly not the best. Installing an engine that is more powerful than needed, results in higher construction costs, higher operating costs, and higher maintenance costs. The owner will therefore not accept such a design. If we want to minimize costs, but still attain the desired speed, we must know what resistance to expect at the desired speed. We can then use the formula for calculating power, &lt;math&gt;P = F \times V&lt;/math&gt; to calculate the power of engine required. 

Since resistance of a ship is not constant, conditions must be specified. There are usually two types of conditions. Service condition refers to the resistance while the ship operates under real conditions, where there are currents, waves, wind etc. The effect of these factors is not very easy to measure or predict, because these conditions are always changing. 

Another condition defined is the trial condition. This is conducted in relatively calm water. This is the time when the ship is put to trial to see if the naval architect or ship builder has met all the obligations as specified in the contract with the ship owner. One of these is also to ensure that the ship is able to attain the optimum speed. 

Given that it is important for the naval architect to know how much resistance will have to be overcome before the ship is made, some way to get this figure must be devised. In order to do that, we must understand what are the reasons behind this resistance. 
We therefore study the components of resistance.

===Components of Resistance===
A ship moves on the surface of water. Water is normally taken to be an incompressible fluid, with low viscosity. However, in order to study the components of resistance, let us begin by assuming that the ship is submerged in an ideal fluid. We then see what changes if the fluid is now viscous and finally look at what happens if we bring the ship to the surface.
====Body in Ideal Fluid====
[[Image:hydrostatic forces.svg|thumb|200px|right|Hydrostatic equilibrium]]
Let us assume that the ship is submerged in an infinitely large ideal fluid, so that the ship is far away from the surface. The forces acting on the ship in static equilibrium are the weight of the ship acting at the centre of gravity, and the pressure forces acting all along the surface, normal to the surface. If the body is neutrally buoyant, then these forces will be equal and opposite. Therefore, the net effect of the hydrostatic forces is to oppose the weight of the body. In fact, this is what is known as the [[w:Buoyancy|Archimedes' Principle]]. 

If the body is in motion, we first change our frame of reference so that we move with the body and therefore see the fluid in motion in the opposite direction. Now, the pressure is not purely hydrostatic. Due to the motion of the fluid, and the relation between pressure and velocity as given by the [[w:Bernoulli's equation|Bernoulli's Equation]], a hydrodynamic pressure is set up. This pressure varies along the body, and is maximum at the start and end of the body. 

The forces acting on the body are everywhere normal to the body. We can split these forces into components along the direction of motion, and transverse to the direction of motion. Due to symmetry of the body, we can see that the transverse forces are in pairs, opposite and equal, and therefore will cancel out. There need not be symmetry in the longitudinal direction, but because the discontinuity in the flow, which was caused by the body, starts and ends with the body, the net opposing forces at the fore end will be the same as the net supporting forces at the aft. Therefore, the net force acting on the body will be zero. 

This paradox, that a body moving in an ideal fluid in steady state, experiences no resistance, was first proposed by [[w:d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] and is known as [[w:D'Alembert's paradox|D'Alemberts paradox]].

====Body in Viscous Fluid====
If we now relax our assumption about the viscosity of the fluid, we need to account for viscous forces. Due to viscosity, the tangential velocity of water relative to the ship is zero at all points on the surface. As we move away from the surface, the velocity gradually increases until it reaches the ideal fluid velocity at some distance away from the body. This layer of high velocity gradients is called the boundary layer. 

Now the viscous force is directly proportional to the velocity gradients. Hence, a viscous force, opposite in direction to the velocity, acts on the body through the boundary layer. This force which acts on the surface of the body is called drag. Drag can be studied by decomposition. The mere presence of a surface leads to a drag, which is called the ''2D drag''. A ship also has a form, and the two ships with the same wetted surface area, but differing in form, will have different drag. This drag is called the ''form drag''. 

The formation of the boundary layer also has an effect on the hydrodynamic pressure forces. As we said, the velocity reaches the ideal fluid velocity at a distance away from the surface. This distance is called the boundary layer thickness. The thickness increases from the bow of the ship to the stern. The pressure forces now act on the ''effective'' body, which is the boundary layer. The net force acting on this body is zero, but because the boundary layer thickness is not uniform, the ship faces the same resisting force, but gets only a part of the supporting stern pressure forces. Hence, there is a net resisting pressure force on the ship because of the effect of viscosity. This is called the ''viscous pressure drag''.

====Body at the surface====
In addition to the the resistance in the ideal and viscous fluids, when the body is at the surface it will subjected to wind resistance, body waves which generates when the body moves and the fluid waves itself.

====Other components of resistance====
1. Induced Resistance: If a vessel moves with a leeway, like in turn or when there is a wind force component sidewards, a lift force (directed sidewards) is developed. Associated with the lift as an induced resistance, which can be considerable, especially for sailing yachts and vessels. When the hull moves slightly sidewards a high pressure is developed on one side (leeward) and a low pressure on the other (windward). The pressure difference gives rise to a flow from the high to the low pressure, normally under the bottom or tip of the keel and rudder, and longitudinal vortices are generated. These vortices contain energy left behind and are thus associated with a resistance component, the Induced Resistance.

2. Appendage Resistance: This resistance is mainly the viscous resistance, hence can be included in the viscous resistance. There are reasons, however, to treat this component separately. First, the Reynold's number, based on the chord length of brackets, struts, etc is considerably smaller than that of the hull herself and therefore a separate scaling is required. Second, the appendages are normally streamlined sections, for which separate empirical relations apply. For sailing yachts the correct shape of the appendage sections is of utmost importance for good performance, particularly since these appendages normally operate at an angle of attack.  

3. Blockage Effect: In restricted waters the flow around the hull and the wave making are influenced by the presence of the confining surface. This could be the seabed in shallow water or the banks of a canal. All resistance components may be influenced. Often the effect is modeled as an additional resistance component due to the Blockage Effect of the confining wall.

4.Air Resistance: An additional resistance, which may be considerable, for instance for fully loaded container ships is the wind resistance. The frontal area facing the relative wind on board the ship can be large and the containers do not have an aerodynamic shape, so large forces may be generated in strong winds. Even in still air, there is in fact a resistance component, however small. This component, the Air Resistance, is considered in the model-ship extrapolation procedure.

5. Added Resistance: A seaway will cause an additional resistance on the vessel. This is mainly due to the generation of waves by the hull when set in motion by waves, but also due to wave reflection in short waves.

===Dimensional Analysis===
===Frictional Resistance===
===Wave making Resistance===
it is the resistance caused by the formation of waves as the ship passes through the water.in slow or medium speed ships wavemaking resistance is small compared with frictional resistance.At high speeds,however the wavemaking resistance increases and may be 50 or 60 % of total resistance(Rt).one attempt to reduce wavemaking resistance is the use of bulbous bow.the wave produced by the bulb interfered with the wave produced by the stem,resulting in a reduced hieght of bow wave.

[[Image:KB_Germany.svg|right|thumbnail|German and Austrian keyboard layout, but remember that Switzerland does not use this layout|400px]]

Often it is useful to be able to switch between German keyboard and an English keyboard. One can also use Unicode or the number keypad and the Alt key to add letters that are not one your usual keyboard &lt;small&gt;(see below)&lt;/small&gt;.

==Linux/Ubuntu==
On a lot of default Linux installations these days, compositing keys are available. Compositing keys are, for example, where you press a key combination to go into 'umlaut' mode, let go of this combination, and then press either a, o, or u (i and e are also available, but not used in German) to produce ä, ö or ü.

To do this with a normal US/British keyboard, press Alt Gr+[, and then press either a, o, or u. Alt Gr is the Alt key usually directly to the right of the space bar. Using Alt Gr with letters also gets you special characters, and for the requirements of German, pressing Alt Gr+s (without any need to press a key afterwards) produces ß.

This works by default in the latest versions of Ubuntu, Arch Linux and Fedora.

Alternatively, you can simply switch your keyboard layout, if you are using X, by opening a terminal and entering the command 'setxkbmap de'. If you have X installed, this command should be available.

==Mac OS X==
# Click the Apple image at the top left of the screen, and when you highlight the System Preferences, click it.
# Click the &quot;International&quot; logo.
# A new window will open with three tabs towards the top, &quot;Language&quot;, &quot;Formats&quot;, and &quot;Input Menu&quot;. Proceed to &quot;Input Menu&quot;.
# Now you can add lots of different keyboards, including German, by checking the boxes on the left under &quot;On&quot;.
# The default way to switch between keyboards is to click the Apple and Space bar at the same time, though this may conflict with another shortcut. To change shortcuts click the button &quot;Keyboard Shortcuts&quot;.

==Windows Vista==
# From the '''Start Menu''' (bottom left of screen) go to the '''Control Panel'''
#* If you are in ''Classic View'', click the '''Regional and Language''' button
#* If you are in ''Control Panel Home'' view, click the '''Clock, Language and Region''' button 
#: Now go to the '''Regional and Language Options'''
# Click the '''Keyboards and Languages''' tab
# Click the &quot;Change keyboards...&quot; button
# To Add a keyboard from a new region, go to &quot;A&lt;u&gt;d&lt;/u&gt;d and search for, in this case, '''+German (''Region'')''' → '''+Keyboard''' → German
# After you found click the box and then click '''OK'''

It seems like this is a long and arduous process to take part in every single time you want to change keyboards, so a great way to make it easier to switch between boards is to click the '''Language Bar''' Tab and either pick &quot;Floating On Desktop&quot; or &quot;Docked in the taskbar&quot;. Another quick way to switch between keyboards is to us the Alt and Shift keys - simply hold Alt and click the Shift key to switch between boards.

==Windows XP==
# Click the '''Start Menu''' and then '''Control Panel'''
#* If you are in ''Category View'', click the Date, Time, Language, and Regional Options
#* If in ''Classic View'', click the Regional and Language Options
# Click on the '''Languages''' tab and the click the '''Details''' button under Text services and input languages
# To Add a keyboard from a new region, go to &quot;A&lt;u&gt;d&lt;/u&gt;d and search for, in this case, '''+German (''Region'')''' → '''+Keyboard''' → German
# After you found click the box and then click '''OK'''

To switch between keyboards, use the same method as the one described for Windows Vista.

==Using Alt==
To use Alt, you must hold the ''Alt'' button and type in a code made up of numbers from the number keypad that specifies which letter or symbol that you want to use. Below are the main ones that you would need for German. With many laptops one also has to use the ''Fn'' key - Holding Fn+Alt and then pressing 225 on the number keypad (usually blue numbers on laptops) would bring up '''ß'''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Ect.|Alt keys for|German characters|112|2}}
|ß||alt + 225
|-
|ü||alt + 129   
|-
|Ü||alt + 0220 
|-
|ö||alt + 0246  
|-
|Ö||alt + 0214 
|-
|ä||alt + 132    
|-
|Ä||alt + 0196 
|}

== ਰੰਗ: Colors ==

[[Image:Flag_of_India.svg|right|caption|thumbnail|250px|ਤਿਰੰਗਾ - the Tricolor: National Flag of India]]
A flag is called ਝੰਡਾ in Punjabi. The picture to the right is the National Flag of India called ਤਿਰੰਗਾ - the Tricolor. 
The three stripts have the following colors
#ਕੇਸਰੀ = safron (Top strip)
#ਚਿੱਟਾ = white also called ਸਫੈਦ (Middle strip)
#ਹਰਾ = green (Lower strip)
The ਕੇਸਰੀ color represents bravery, the ਚਿੱਟਾ (white) color peace and ਹਰਾ (green) color symolizes progress.
In the middle of the flag is Ashok Chakra in ਨੀਲਾ (blue) color having twenty four spokes portraying the prevalence of righteousness all 24 hours of the day.

The following are some more colors in Punjabi
#ਲਾਲ = red
#ਭੂਰਾ = brown
#ਉਨਾਬੀ = maroon
#ਸੂਹਾ = bright shining red
#ਪੀਲਾ = yellow
#ਨਾਰੰਗੀ = orange
#ਸੁਨਹਿਰਾ = golden
#ਗੁਲਾਬੀ = pink
#ਕਾਲਾ = black
#ਜਾਮਨੀ= purple
ਲਾਲ color is associated with danger while ਸੂਹਾ color is generally associated with bridal wear. Many young Sikhs prefer ਨਾਭੀ color turbans(sikh head-wear).

== Excercises ==

1. Write the Punjabi names of the colors found in the Tricolor.
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#Safron: ਕੇਸਰੀ 
#White: ਚਿੱਟਾ 
#Green: ਹਰਾ 
#Blue: ਨੀਲਾ (Ashoka Chakra's color)}}
2. What are the following colors called in Punjabi

#Purple: ਜਾਮੁਨੀ 
#Golden: ਸੁਨਿਹਰਾ 
#Red: ਲਾਲ }}

      <comment>/* User Privileges */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A great percentage of the operating systems that are used today have user account privileges. These privileges may be for security reasons, to make sure that someone does not leak internal company information out, or to protect the well-being of the computer from some people's incompetence with a computer, or to prevent grave mistake from crashing the system, or to stop system failure or hacking of a computer (internally or externally) through an account with restricted access to files. 

For example, in Windows XP, there are two kinds of accounts: Administrator and Limited. When one has an Administrator account, they have virtually ultimate power, and can change system files or other users' files at will. On the other hand, a person with a Limited account can only change their own files and such. Multi-user Operating systems ''should'' incorporate user account privilege restriction in their design.

* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;

my biggest hobby is computer and all my life is compuuter..
whatever i know till now is experimental and self-study
i know alot experiences on programming (C, C++, Delphi), Haking, program Cracking, and some other things like Office, Photoshop, ...
as i said all of them are self-study and maybe not good in some cases..
i'm not sure if i'm going to write any books or even edit something... i'm so lazy :D
however i thinked it's better to at least join this place :D

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Does it float or sink?==
If you put a steel needle in water, does it float or sink?

Well, usually it sinks, as it has a density that is greater than water's.
You know that wood floats and steel sinks, except when the steel object is shaped as a boat, as it contains air, that is much lighter than water.
Effectively, if you put a steel needle on the surface of water using your fingers, there is no way to keep it afloat.

==Experiment:==
*'''Step 1:''' You need a quiet water surface. You can fill a basin or a large pot.

*'''Step 2:''' Put on a table a piece of toilet paper, and put the needle on it.

*'''Step 3:''' Using both hands, raise the toilet paper, keeping it horizontal, with the needle on it.

*'''Step 4:''' Drop the paper onto the water surface. Immediately, it soaks, but it stays on the surface.

* '''Step 5:''' After a few seconds, the toilet paper begins to sink, but the needle does not. It keeps floating!

==Observations==
If you look at it at a short distance, if possible using a torch, you see that the water surface is bent under the needle, like a sheet under a heavy bar.

Don't touch it, and don't move the water, as that would cause the needle to sink.

If you drop gently some water in the basin at a distance from the needle, the needle keeps floating.

But if you put even a single drop of liquid soap, like the one for washing-up, after a few seconds the needle sinks, and you cannot make it float any more on that polluted water.

So, you have seen that fresh water behaves as it were wrapped in a thin fragile film that is able to keep very small objects afloat; but soapy water has no such film, everything is soaked up, and what is heavier than water is bound to sink.

View a short video that demonstrates this experiment [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1RVOc0VZ30]

==Physics==
The steel needle floats on top of the water because of '''surface tension'''.  Surface tension happens because the water molecules at the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than they are to the air molecules above them.  The water molecules make an invisible skin on the water’s surface that allows things like the needle to float on top of the water.

When soap is added to the water, the water molecules aren't drawn together as strongly.  The soap molecules combine with the water molecules and lessen the liquid’s surface tension.  The new attractions between the air, water, and soap molecules are weaker than the water-to-water attractions.  As a result, the liquid’s surface is no longer strong enough to support the weight of the steel needle and the steel needle sinks.

You have already learnt the first five letters and the ten matras of Gurmukhi. In this lesson you will learn the ''diacritics'' of Gurmukhi and their usage in Punjabi.

== Diacritics ==

Diacritics are the signs that are added to vowels and consonants to add phonetic value to them. Punjabi has three diacritics namely  bindi (ਆਂ), tippi (ਅੰ) and udhak (ਅੱ) used with vowels. The use of these diacritics change the meaning of the words. Therefore learning correct usage of these diacritics is important.&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Gurmukhi_Bindi_Ani.gif|left|60px]]&lt;br&gt;
'''ਆਂ- bindi''' : Bindi is the ''dot'' above ਆ (see animation on the left) and [[Image:Gurmukhi_Tippi_Ani.gif|left|60px]] 
'''ਅੰ- tippi''' : Bindi is the ''dot'' above ਆ (see animation on the left) and tippi the inverted semi-circular shape above ਅ. Bindi and tippi are used with vowels to nasalize the vowel sounds or to reinforce the following nasal sound and therefore come along with one of the matras. Both serve the same purpose but bindi is used with kanna, bihari, lanv, dulavan, horha and kanaorha whereas tippi is used exclusively with mukta, sihari, aaunkarh and dulaenkarh. See the following examples.
:::ਆ + ਉਂ + ਸ = ਆਉਂਸ = ounce
:::ਹੈਂ + ਸ = ਹੈਂਸ = hence
:::ਸੈਂ + ਸ = ਸੈਂਸ = sense

:::ਸਾ + ਇੰ + ਸ = ਸਾਇੰਸ = science
:::ਸਿੰ + ਸ = ਸਿੰਸ = since
:::ਐ + ਸੰ + ਸ = ਐਸੰਸ = essence
----
[[Image:Gurmukhi_Udhak_Ani.gif|left|60px]] 
'''ਅੱ- udhak''' : Udhak is used to reinforce the sound of the consonant that follows. It is interesting to note that udhak comes with the letter preceding the letter to be reinforced. 

:::ਸੈੱ + ਸ = ਸੈੱਸ = cess
:::ਅ +ਸੈੱ + ਸ = ਅਸੈੱਸ = assess
:::ਸੈਂ + ਸੱ + ਸ = ਸੈਂਸੱਸ = census

== Exercises ==

1. Read these English words written in Gurmukhi.
#ਆਉਂਸ
#ਐਸੰਸ
#ਸਾਇੰਸ  
#ਅਸੈੱਸ 
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#Ounce
#Essence
#Science
#Assess}}
2. Write the above listed words in Gurmukhi and English side by side.

3. Write these English words in Gurmukhi.
#Hence
#Census
#Since
#Cess
#Sense
{{HideNseek|title=Solutions|text=
#ਹੈਂ + ਸ = ਹੈਂਸ
#ਸੈਂ + ਸੱ + ਸ = ਸੈਂਸੱਸ 
#ਸਿੰ + ਸ = ਸਿੰਸ 
#ਸੈੱ + ਸ = ਸੈੱਸ
#ਸੈਂ + ਸ = ਸੈਂਸ }}

== Summary ==

So you have learnt the first five letters, the ten matras and three diacritics of Gurmukhi. You are now ready to move on to the others rows of Gurmukhi letters. In the next lesson you will learn the five velars of Gumukhi script.

===Ingredients===
* 2 cups (480 mL) sugar
* 1 cup (240 mL) water
* 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) cream of tartar
* 1 Tbs. (15 mL) citric acid &lt;ref&gt;In the United States, citric acid is available from some Armenian and South Asian grocers, and on-line from cheese-making suppliers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* powdered sugar

===Preparation===
#Boil the sugar, water and cream of tartar over medium-low heat stirring gently until syrup reaches 310ºF (155ºC) (hard crack) or is pale brown, hardens completely when dropped on to a cold plate and snaps between the teeth when cold.
# Pour the mixture onto an oiled work and sprinkle with the citric acid.
#Fold in the sides and thoroughly work the acid in.
#When it is cool enough to touch, roll it into sticks and snip off drop size bits.
#Sift powdered sugar onto them and shake to coat.
#Allow to cool and store in an air-tight container.

This dip is, in my opinion, healthier and more tasty than butter or mayonnaise:

==Ingredients==

* 1/2 cup of Dijon mustard
* 1/4 cup of mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon horseradish

==Procedure==

#Mix all the ingredients together. Can be kept refrigerated for a few days</text>

'''Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte'''
==Ingredients==
===Shortcrust base===
*125g  (3/4 cup)	flour
*10 	g (1 tsp.)	cocoa powder
*3 	g (½ tsp.)		baking powder  
*50 	g (¼ cup)		sugar
*8	g (2 tsp)	vanilla sugar (1 packet)
*1 			egg white
*50 	g (¼ cup)		butter
===Cake===
*3 	ea.		eggs
*1 	ea.		egg yolk
*2 	Tbs.		warm water
*100 g  (½ cup)	sugar
*8	g  (2 tsp.)	vanilla sugar  (1 packet)
*3 	drops		bitter-almond oil (2 tsp. almond extract)
*1/8 tsp. 		cinnamon
*75 	g  (½ cup)	flour
*10 	g  (1 Tbs.)	cocoa powder
*25 	g  (3 Tbs.)	cornstarch
*1½ g (½ tsp.)	baking powder 

===Filling===
*1 	can (24 oz) 	sour cherries, stoned (750g)
*80 	g  (6 Tbs.)	sugar
*40 	g  (5 Tbs.)	cornstarch
*2 	Tbs.		Kirschwasser (cherry water)
*2 	tsp.		gelatine, powdered
*3 	Tbs.		cold water
*500 ml (2 cups)	heavy cream
*8	g (2 tsp.)	vanilla sugar (1 packet)
*1 	Tbs.		sugar
*40 	g (2 oz.)	shaved chocolate for garnish
*1 	jar		glacé or maraschino cherries for decoration &lt;ref&gt;(If possible, use only cherries in real maraschino liqueur, not the  imitation maraschino cherries found in grocers and supermarkets)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==

For the shortcrust base:
#Mix the flour, cocoa and baking powder in a bowl. Mix the eggs with the sugar and vanilla sugar and pour into a well in the middle of the flour.
#Mix the liquid into some of the flour until it forms a porridge-like mass
#Add the cold butter, cut into pieces
#Mix in the rest of the flour and knead briefly into to a ball
#Rest the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes
#Then roll the dough out to fit the base of a 20 cm (8 inch) spring form cake pan
#Bake at 160ºC ( 325ºF)  for 20 minutes

===For the cake:===

#Mix the flour, cornstarch, baking powder and cocoa powder with a whisk
#Whisk the 4 egg yolks with the warm water until it is foamy and little by little add 2/3 of the sugar, the vanilla sugar, almond extract and cinnamon 
#Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and beat in the rest of the sugar a little at a time
#Fold the beaten egg whites into the egg yolk mixture
#Sprinkle the flour mixture onto the egg mixture and carefully incorporate.
#Pour into a 20 cm/8 inch springform pan lined with parchment paper
#Bake at 160ºC/325ºF oven for about 35 minutes until a wooden skewer or toothpick comes out clean when the cake is pierced 
#Cool cake in pan for 15 minutes, then turn out onto a cooling rack to cool completely

===Filling:===
#Drain the cherries in a sieve. Reserve the juice.
#Heat ¾ of the juice
#Mix the cornstarch with the rest of the juice
#When the juice starts to boil pour a little onto the cornstarch.  Mix well and while stirring pour it back into the saucepan. Cook until thickened.
#Add the sugar and dissolve
#Mix the cherries in and allow to cool.
#Add the Kirschwasser.
#Sprinkle the gelatin onto the 3 tablespoons of water and allow to bloom for 10 minutes stirring from time to time.
#Heat carefully until the gelatin has dissolved. Allow to cool to room temperature.
#Whip the cream to soft peaks and fold in the completely cool but still liquid gelatin.  Whip until stiff adding vanilla sugar to taste. (If you don't have vanilla sugar, use a tablespoon of vanilla extract and granulated sugar to taste.)

===Assembly:===

#Spread half the cherry mixture and then 1/3 of the whipped cream mixture onto the shortcrust base.
#Cut the cake horizontally into two discs using a length of cotton thread
#Press one disc down well onto the filling
#Spread the rest of the cherry mixture onto the cake and half of the rest of the whipped cream.
#Cover the filling with the last disc of cake and spread the rest of the whipped cream on top.
#Strew the top of the torte with shaved chocolate and decorate with glacé or maraschino cherries and refrigerate for  4 hours or longer

==Notes==

* The cake layers may optionally be sprinkled with Kirschwasser before assembly.

A '''tortilla chip''' is a snack food made from corn tortillas, which are cut into wedges and then fried, alternatively they may be discs pressed out of corn masa then fried or baked. Corn tortillas are made of corn, vegetable oil, salt and water. Although first mass-produced in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, tortilla chips are considered to be a Mexican food. Though usually made of yellow corn (as pictured), they can also be made of white, blue, or red corn.

==Ingredients==
* 1 bag  corn [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortillas]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]] for frying
* A heavy deep pot
* seasoning

==Procedure==
#Fill the pot with 2 inches of oil.
#Clip a confectioners thermometer to the side of the pot so that the tip is submerged in the oil but not touching the bottom.
#Heat the oil to 360ºF (180ºC).
#Slice a pile of tortillas through the centre.
#Stack the two piles together and cut across to form quarters.
#Stack the quarters and cut through to form eighths
#Gently drop the tortilla pieces into the hot oil, a handful at a time, no more.
#After the initial vapour has boiled off, agitate gently with a slotted spoon to fry evenly
#When tortilla chips are golden brown, remove with a spider or slotted spoon, about 2 minutes.
#Drain on paper towels and season lightly with salt or seasoned salt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''3.1. Hypotheses'''
2 tailed = predict an effect - such as a difference or correlation (no specific direction - can go either way)

1 tailed = predict a particular direction of the effect e.g. that positive correlation will occur (directional) 

'''3.2 Experimental methods''' 

----
'''Laboratory''' - researcher deliberately manipulates the independent variable while maintaining strict control over the other variables in a controlled, artificial environment. E.g. Bandura - independent variable of exposure to aggression, dependent variable of imitation of aggression in children under controlled lab conditions by randomly allocating children to either a condition where they saw 1) an adult being violent towards the Bobo doll, or 2) where the adult showed no violence. The number of aggressive acts by each child were also measured in the laboratory. 

This is the most scientific method because it demonstrates cause and effect. lab experiments increase control and accurate measurement of variables - therefore more objectivity. lab standardisation means more chance to replicate the results again. 
Weaknesses - total control over variables is not possible, artificial setting will cause a lack of ecological validity, results may be more biased due to sampling, demand characteristics... ethical problems may arise due to deception and mistreatment of subjects 

'''Field experiment''' - researcher deliberately manipulates the independent variable, but does so in the subject's natural environment. 

This type of experiment will have greater ecological validity and less bias from sampling, and ecological validity (subjects often do not know they are being observed)

HOWEVER, it is more difficult to replicate this type of study, it is difficult to record data (most data will be qualitative). Big issue of ethics - invasion of privacy, lack of consent, and deception. Infiltration of a group may prove dangerous and is unfair on the subjects. however, subject privacy is usually observed (i.e. subjects or locations are not named). 

----

'''3.3 Sampling''' - No one under the age of 16 should be used. 

Random - truly random and occurs only if every member of the target population has a chance of being chosen. the best chance of an unbiased sample, however very difficult to test randomly because of often large target population size and people who are selected from the population may not want to take part in the experiment. 

Stratified - dividing the target population into subcategories (strata) and then selecting members of these subcategories in the proportion they occur in the real target population e.g. target pop. consists of 75% men and 25% women, therefore 15 men and 5 women used in the experiment. 

Opportunity - selecting subjects that are available at the time. e.g. university psychologists may sample from their students. Quick and convenient, however more biased and risk of researcher choosing subjects who are 'more helpful' or demand characteristics from the participants if they have a personal relationship with the experimenter e.g. tutor/student relationship... 

Volunteer - volunteers who reply to press adverts asking for participants in a study. A convenient method as volunteering is made on the basis of informed consent and is ethical. however volunteering may show an excessive keeness on the part of the participants and may lead to demand characteristics during the experiment. Biased on the part of the subject. 

----

'''3.4 Experimental design''' - 3 main types. 
1. Repeated measures - using the same subjects in each condition of the experiment. e.g. giving a group of subjects a test with no alcohol influence, followed later by the same test with alcohol influence. subjects may do better in the second condition due to learning, different tests may be needed - this makes the experiment lack ecological validity. 

2. Independent measures - using different subjects in each condition 

3. Matched pairs - different but similar subjects used in each condition 

NB inferential statistics = Repeated measures design (Wilcoxon test); Independent measures and matched pairs design (Mann Whitney U test)
----
'''3.5 Nomothetic vs idiographic approaches to psychology'''
----
'''3.6 Triangulation'''
----
'''3.7 Types and functions of case studies'''
----
'''3.8 Content analysis'''
----
'''3.9 Observational research '''
----
'''3.10 Questionnaires, questions and transcription'''

----
'''3.11 Verbal protocols'''

----

'''3.12 Types of data - nominal/ordinal and descriptive statistics'''

----

'''3.13 Self report methods '''

'''Browning''' is the process of imparting a brown colour to the surface of foodstuffs both for appearance and for flavouring before subjecting them to further processing. The foods most frequently subjected to browning are [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]] and [[Cookbook:Vegetables|vegetables]] but the technique can be applied to virtually any solid food.

Browning can be achieved by different means but the most frequently used methods are [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéing]] and searing.  [[Cookbook:Grilling|Grilling]] and [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]] are also sometimes used for larger quantities of food when pan browning is impractical due to volume and time constraints. Also, large cuts of meat are often browned in the oven at a high temperature of 400ºF or more before lowering the temperature to complete cooking. 

Some foods and dishes which may be subjected to browning include:

* Meats for soups and stews
* Minced (ground) meats used in sauces and ragoûts such as bolognese sauce
* Vegetables used in soups and stews e.g. French onion soup

'''Juice''' is the name given to the liquid part of fruits, and also of vegetables and meats. Juice is extracted  from fruit in the making of beverages, jellies, syrups, cordials, confectionery, desserts, sauces, reductions, etc. and also for many flavouring purposes.

Citrus juice is perhaps the most ubiquitous of juices being used as a beverage as well as in numerous dishes as a flavouring and seasoning.

Dishes and recipes which contain juice in varying amounts include:

* [[Cookbook:Ceviche|Ceviche]]
* [[Cookbook:Crêpes Suzette|Crêpes Suzette]]
* [[Cookbook:Hollandaise|Hollandaise sauce]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am 42, a partner, a mother, a grandmother, a realtor, an event manager, a cross-stitcher and designer, a femme girl with power tools, a walking contradiction. I have been with my beloved for 18 years. My spirituality tends to the pagan with some buddhism thrown in. The older I get, the less tolerant of bullshit I find myself.

Exception handling has become a staple in most modern programming languages. Parrot, since it intends to host many such languages must support a robust exception system. Not only does Parrot use exceptions for error handling and recovery, but it also encourages the use of control flow exceptions to implement high-level control flow features of those languages as well. What this means is that the exception subsystem is one of the most important for language implementers to become familiar with.

{{warning|Parrot's exception system is currently being reimplemented to make it more powerful, scalable, internally consistent and robust. Some of the information in this page may be out of date.}}

== Exceptions: The Basics ==

Exceptions are broken down into two primary parts: the exception object and the exception handler. Exception handlers are like subroutines in many ways, and must be specially registered with Parrot before they can be used. When Parrot detects an error, it creates an exception object by including information about the error, a continuation for the current control flow state, and a few other pieces of information. Exceptions, like most everything else in Parrot, are PMCs and can be stored, manipulated, and used like other PMCs. 

Once the exception object is created, Parrot looks through it's list of handlers, and passes it's exception object to each. Handlers are stored in a stack-like structure, and the most recently registered handler will have the first access to the exception object. The handler can do one of several things. First, it can handle the exception: It can fix the error, call the return continuation that is within the exception object, and returns control flow back to where it was before the error occurred. Second, it could re-throw the exception, passing it to the next handler in the stack. Third, it could ignore the exception. Exceptions which are ignored, or for which no handlers are available, cause Parrot to exit.

Hi Andy - nice to see you active on Wikibooks :) when you get the shot, could you take a look at [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Proposals#Proposal_to_implement_metadata_on_Wikibooks|this]] and drop some thoughts there? It looks like the kind of thing you'd be interested in.

==Translation (飜文)==

# 大阿哥你從那裡來的？
# 我從朝鮮王京來的
# 如今往那裡去？ 
# 我往京城去。
# 你幾時從王京起程的？ 
# 我在本月初一日起程的。 
# 你既是在本月一日起程的，到現在差不多半個月，為何纔到這裡呢？
# 因為有一個伙伴落後了來，我慢慢走著等候，所以來遲了。
# 那個伙伴現在趕到了嗎？ 
# 這個伙伴便是，昨天纔到的。
# 你計算本月底能到京城嗎？
# 我怎麼得知，若上天憐憫身體安好時，想是可到吧！
# 你是朝鮮人，又有什麼空閒把漢語學的相當好呢？
# 我原來跟漢人讀書，因此會一點漢語。
# 你跟誰讀書的？
# 我在漢學堂裡讀書的。 
# 你讀的是那類書呢？
# 我讀的是論語、孟子、小學的書。
# 你每天做什麼功課？
# 每天清早起來到學校裡跟老師讀書，放學到家裡吃完飯後就到學校裡去寫字，在師傅面前講書。
# 講什麼書？
# 講論語、孟子、小學的書。
# 講完書又做什麼功課？ 
# 到晚間在師傅面前抽籤背書，若能背時，師傅給一張免帖，若是不能背時，管理的生員叫他臥倒打三板。
# 抽籤背書怎麼給免帖？
# 每人各做一塊竹片，寫著各自的姓名，裝入同一個籤筒裡，叫管理的生員拿籤筒來搖動，從那裡面抽一支，抽的是誰，就叫他背書，背的好時，師傅給一張免帖，那免帖上寫著免打三板，那免帖頂上還畫著花押。倘若不會背，交出免帖撕毀，將前功抵過免打，若是沒有免帖，必定接受打三板。
# 你學那漢文做什麼？
# 你說的雖然也是，敝意似仍不盡然，如今帝王一統四海，天下全部受管轄，世上使用漢語的地方很多，我們這朝鮮話，只用於朝鮮地面，一過義州，來到漢人地面，因為都是漢語，有誰問著一句話瞪眼不能回答時，別人將我們看成甚麼人呢？
# 你 學這漢文，是你自願學嗎？或是你的父母叫你學呢？
# 是 我們的父母叫我學的啊！
# 你學了幾年了？ 
# 我 學了半年多？ 
# 都會 嗎？
# 每天與漢人生員住在一處讀書，因此會一些。
# 你的師傅是甚麼人？ 
# 是漢人。
# 有多少年紀了？
# 三十五歲了。
# 專心教書嗎？ 
# 我們的師傅原來性情溫順，因此很專心教書。
# 你們眾生員內多少漢人，多少朝鮮人？
# 漢人朝鮮人正好各一半。
# 那裡面也有頑劣的嗎？ 
# 為什麼沒有頑劣的呢？雖然為首的生員將那頑劣的稟告師傅責打，可是並不知道害怕。這裡頭漢人小孩的習性很壞，似乎還是朝鮮的小孩馴良些。
# 大阿哥你現在要往那裡去？
# 我也是要往京城去。 
# 你既然要往京城去，我是朝鮮人，漢人地方行走不熟，我與你做伴一同去如何？
# 這樣很好啊！我們一同走吧！
# 阿哥你貴姓？ 
# 我姓王。

    <title>Econometric Theory/Properties of OLS Estimators</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">OLS estimators have the following properties:
# Linear
#Unbiased
# Efficient: it has the minimum variance
#Consistent
=Linear=
=Unbiased=
Suppose that the population size is 100 for anything that we are studying. We use samples of size 10 to estimate the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of the population. Everytime we use a different sample (a different set of 10 unique parts of the population), we will get a different &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

With the OLS method of getting &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we get a situation wherein after repeated attempts of trying out different samples of the same size, the mean (average) of all the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; from the samples will be equal to the actual &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; of the population as a whole.

Basically, this means that if you do the exercise over and over again with different parts of the population, and then you find the mean for all the answers you get, you will have the correct answer (or you will be very close to it).

A biased estimator will yield a mean that is not the value of the true parameter of the population.

=Efficient: Minimum variance=

This property is what makes the OLS method of estimating &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; the best of all other methods. When there are more than one unbiased method of estimation to choose from, that estimator which has the lowest variance is best. (Variance is a measure of how far the different &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are from their mean; the variance is the average distance of an element from the average.)

An estimator (a function that we use to get estimates) that has a lower variance is one whose individual data points are those that are closer to the mean. This estimator is statistically more likely than others to provide accurate answers. The OLS estimator is one that has a minimum variance.

This property is simply a way to determine which estimator to use.
*An estimator that is unbiased but does not have the minimum variance is not good.
*An estimator that has the minimum variance but is biased is not good
*An estimator that is unbiased and has the minimum variance of all other estimators is the best (efficient).

The OLS estimator is an efficient estimator.

=Consistent=
A consistent estimator is one which approaches the real value of the parameter in the population as the size of the sample, n, increases.

__NOTOC__
'''''Fonds blanc de boeuf'''''      '''White Beef Stock'''&lt;/br&gt;
'''''Fonds brun de boeuf'''''       '''Brown Beef Stock'''

==Ingredients==
*3 lb. beef shin bones sawn into 2-inch lengths
*3 lb. beef marrow bones, sawn into 2-inch lengths
*2 lb. beef short ribs, sawn into 2-inch lengths
*2 lb. veal shank, sawn into 2-inch lengths
*1 lb. chicken carcasses
*½ lb. onions, medium dice
*2 leeks, including green part, trimmed and thoroughly washed to remove all sand
*2 oz. carrots, scraped and cut into medium dice
:a ''bouquet garni'' of:
*6 fresh parsley sprigs with stems
*2 fresh thyme sprigs or ½ tsp. dried thyme
*1 bay leaf
*½ tsp. whole black peppercorns
*1 tsp. salt

* water to cover (about 1½ gallons)

==Procedure==

===Fond blanc - White stock===
#Place all the meat and bones in a stock pot and cover with water to 2 inches above.
#Bring to a simmer over medium heat , skimming of foam and scum as it rises to the surface.
#Reduce the heat and simmer uncovered and undisturbed for 30 minutes. Do not let it boil.
#Skim if necessary and add the vegetables, ''bouquet garni'' and salt.
#Stir, partially cover and simmer for 6 to 8 hours.
#Using tongs or a spider remove the bones and discard.
#Strain the stock into another container and discard the vegetables.
#Now strain the stock back into the rinsed stock pot through a double layer of dampened cheesecloth.
#Set the pot in a sink of cold water to cool rapidly then put it into the refrigerator to chill.
#Remove from the refrigerator and lift the layer of solidified fat off and discard.
#Divide the stock into suitably sized portions and freeze.

===Fond brun - Brown stock===
#Brown the bones in the oven at 400ºF turning from time to time being careful not to burn them.
#Remove the bones form the oven and place them in the stock pot.
#Place the baking pan on the stove top and brown the onions and carrots in the pan adding some oil or fat if necessary. Add them to the stock pot.
#Deglaze the pan with some water and add to the stockpot.
#Continue as above. 

===Notes===
* If not frozen, stock should be refrigerated in a covered container but must be used within 3 to 4 days or brought to the boil that often or it will sour.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Start with a beveled cube==
Here is the first confusing sentence, I do not understand because I got 2.46. 
When I click on &quot;bevel&quot; I only can bewel the cube. There is no &quot;Recursion&quot; dialog or a level on the screen. Secondly, when I press '''Enter''' and I want to bevel again - of course - it bewels inside and not the edges of the cube as seen in the picture. 

Either my eyes are getting bad or someone has to add a sentence referring to Blender 2.46 in this passage.
I also do not get the point at the same step (beveling the cube) in the &quot;Die another way&quot; tutorial. [[User:AriesT|AriesT]] ([[User talk:AriesT|talk]]) 17:11, 26 August 2008 (UTC)

Do we really need two pages on how to do the same thing? Especially when one has been changed to be based on the other so that it's basically the same thing, the same way? 07:16, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

==Looping troubles in 249.2==

Don't ask me why, but the removal of looped edges needs to be done twice every time in my version (249.2). After the first time the selection just expands to the neighboring edges. Selecting the right edge ''again'', then looping again and using x-&gt;edge loop again does the trick. And also select only visible needs to be turned '''on''', not off! Otherwise the looping trick won't work at all.


it worked fine with select-&gt;edge loops, for me in 2.49b [[User:Pearts|Pearts]] ([[User talk:Pearts|talk]]) 03:02, 12 July 2010 (UTC)

==First method==
'''--[[User:MSK61|MSK61]] ([[User talk:MSK61|talk]]) 12:44, 23 April 2008 (UTC):''' I think what's meant here is to select five vertices, one at each spot center. The above description may be interpreted as selecting five vertices(the center plus 4 corners) at each spot of the five spots.

'''--[[User:CamStone|CamStone]] ([[User talk:CamStone|talk]]) 13:19, 25 Jun 2009 (UTC):''' Nope, you're supposed to be selecting faces: the five faces that will be the spots on this side of the die.

'''[[User:Mast3rlinkx|Mast3rlinkx]] ([[User talk:Mast3rlinkx|talk]]) 23:31, 28 January 2010 (UTC):''' CamStone, you're one step behind. MSK61, the original editor said the same thing you just said.

When building the die with this method (method #2) I do not see the benefit of dividing and subdividing the faces for the spots.  Learning the method of doing so was valuable for future work, however it is unnecessary to do so in order to create the desired effect for this exercise.  Instead simply select the faces that will be used as spots and extrude them inward by the prescribed number of units (either .17 or -.17 depending on the side).

I followed the steps diligently in 2.49b, including the three different methods by assigning each method to a different face of the cube. the end result on each face looks like ugly cardboard holes, carved out from inside to outside. the creasing left a black spot inside the negative extrusion. am going to move to the video tutorial before i attempt to fix this. Have also saved the multi-knife cut version of the beveled cube as a separate file so can start again and perhaps catch the mistake.

[[User:Niyambhushan|Niyambhushan]] ([[User talk:Niyambhushan|talk]]) 03:29, 21 September 2010 (UTC)

Both the first and second methods include a step where you start to extrude each pip, then cancel it, before splitting into triangles -- though I think hitting ESC at that point only cancels the movement of the extruded face and still leaves a copy there, which every other tutorial I've seen warns about.  I can see that the results are very different based on whether you perform or skip this step (it seemed like a non-operation, so I only did it on the first face and skipped it on the other five).  Following the step gives you more distinct-looking cutouts at the subsurface step.  But I completely fail to see why this step would make any difference.  It would be nice to have a bit of theory to go with that particular strange action.  --[[User:BrianEnigma|BrianEnigma]] ([[User talk:BrianEnigma|talk]]) 17:37, 3 January 2011 (UTC)

I completely agree with BrianEnigma. It doesn't explain what the extrude + ESC does. I'm just following the book from the beginning to the end and this part is puzzling. Can someone add an explanation? I don't quite understand what it does so cannot add an explanation myself. If hitting ESC only cancels the movement of the extruded face leaving a copy there, isn't it the same thing as hitting ENTER without moving the mouse after pressing E for extruding?! [[User:Freis|Freis]] ([[User talk:Freis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Freis|contribs]]) 22:02, 24 March 2011 (UTC)

==Second method==
If we're extruding and pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|ESC}} aren't we doubling up the vertices? This works in the first method because we merge all 4 newly created vertices into a central point, creating a central vertex; but in method 2 we subdivide the face to create the central vertex, leaving the doubled up vertices in place. I'm still learning Blender so I'm wondering if this is intentional for some reason, perhaps it affects the subsurf to give a nicer edge? I don't know. If this is intentional, can an explanation be included? [[User:Lxxxv|Lxxxv]] ([[User talk:Lxxxv|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lxxxv|contribs]]) 21:18, 20 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Please note''' - Join assumes that that input data is sorted based on the key on which the join is going to take place.
==Delimited data==

In delimited data, elements of a record are separated by a special 'delimiter' character. In the CSV files, fields are delimited by commas or tabs:

 $ '''cat j1'''
 1,a
 1,b
 2,c
 2,d
 2,e
 3,f
 3,g
 4,h
 4,i
 5,j

 $ '''cat j2'''
 1,A
 1,B
 1,C
 2,D
 2,E
 4,F
 4,G
 5,H
 6,I
 6,J

 $ '''join -t , -a 1 -a 2 -o 0,1.2,2.2 j1 j2'''
 1,a,A
 1,a,B
 1,a,C
 1,b,A
 1,b,B
 1,b,C
 2,c,D
 2,c,E
 2,d,D
 2,d,E
 2,e,D
 2,e,E
 3,f,
 3,g,
 4,h,F
 4,h,G
 4,i,F
 4,i,G
 5,j,H
 6,,I
 6,,J

Explanation of options:

 &quot;-t ,&quot;          Input and output field separator is &quot;,&quot; (for CSV)
 &quot;-a 1&quot;          Output a line for every line of j1 not matched in j2
 &quot;-a 2&quot;          Output a line for every line of j2 not matched in j1
 &quot;-o 0,1.2,2.2&quot;  Output field format specification:

0 denotes the match (join) field (needed when using &quot;-a&quot;)     1.2 denotes field 2 from file 1 (&quot;j1&quot;)     2.2 denotes field 2 from file 2 (&quot;j2&quot;) &quot;j1&quot;.

Using the &quot;-a&quot; option creates a full outer join as in SQL.

This command must be given two and only two input files.

==Multi-file Joins==

To join several files you can loop through them.

 $ '''join -t , -a 1 -a 2 -o 0,1.2,2.2 j1 j2 &gt; J'''

File &quot;J&quot; is now the full outer join of &quot;j1&quot;, &quot;j2&quot;.

 $ '''join -t , -a 1 -a 2 -o 0,1.2,2.2 J j3 &gt; J'''

and so on through j4, j5, ...

For many files this is best done with a loop

  $ '''for i in * ; do join -t , -a 1 -a 2 -o 0,1.2,2.2 J $i &gt; J ; done'''

==Sorted Data Note==

'''join''' assumes that the input data has been sorted by the field to be joined.  See section on '''sort''' for details.

==Grading Students of Varying Abilities &amp; Disabilities: Can Teachers Grade Fairly?==


By Jsmit219, Fall 2008

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''By the end of this article you should:''' 

&lt;li&gt;1. Be able to differentiate between criterion-referenced and norm-referenced grading system

&lt;li&gt;2. Be able to list fair grading recommendations

&lt;li&gt;3. Be able to discuss varying uses of portfolios
 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Introduction ==
With the introduction and federal legislation of Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), schools now are mandated and funded to educate students with varying disabilities in a least restrictive setting possible.  This requires administrators and teachers to develop appropriate grading systems to monitor students' progress in the schools.  Students classified with various disabilities will more likely have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) with a set of goals for these students to achieve.  In a particular class, can students with disabilities compete with other students who do not have such disabilities?  Perhaps, if the grading system can be developed to account for differences and varying levels of abilities disabilites while promoting a set of goals which promote desired outcomes and habits.

== Grading Systems ==
Svinicki (1999) discussed the two main grading systems and philosophies that are in use today. One is the '''norm-referenced systems''' in which the grades per class, for example, is distributed throughout as a bell curve with mean or average grades making up the majority of the students’ performance and few individuals performing very high or very low.  In the '''criterion-referenced systems''', there is a set amount of points or absolute quantity and the grades reflect the amount of points that students earned.  The points in turn, can be translated into percentages and/or letter grades such as A for 90% or greater or F for &lt;60%.  Another form of criterion-referenced system is measured by mastery or pass/fail.  In this case, a minimum standard is pre-set to measure achievement or performance.  I would think some point system is still required for this type of system to calculate the performance or students' progress over time.  A rubric may also be used to break down the different kinds of abilities used in the performance or activity.  A rubric can be designed to work for all students of varying individual abilities.

== Recommendations for Fair and Accurate Grading==
University of Oregon's ''Teaching Effectiveness Program'' (TEP, 2006) recommend the following when grading fairly and accurately:

* State clear grading policies in your syllabus and go over them on the first few days of class.
* Keep accurate, numerical grades when possible.
* Give many opportunities for assessment to allow for mistakes and discourage undue pressure or stress.
* Inform students of their progress periodically.
* Give choices in terms of topics or format.


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;40%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFCC;
border: solid 5px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
'''&quot;Do not overemphasize grades.  Emphasize learning over grades&quot; (TEP, 2006).  '''&lt;center&gt; ''' &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

== Portfolio Assessment ==
Due to the demand for alternative assessments, educators and critics have researched the notion of using a body of student's work or '''portfolio''' to &quot;capture a richer array of what students know and can do... current goals for students go beyond knowledge of facts and include such things as problem solving, critical thinking, ... goals also include dispositions such as persistence, flexibility, motivation, and self-confidence&quot; (Arter &amp; Spandel, 2008, p.1).  Assessments should then align with these goals or &quot;what we consider to be important outcomes for students&quot; (ibid, p.1).  A portfolio can encourage '''self-reflection''', especially when it is discussed verbally as a form of &quot;oral report&quot;, thus making it instructional as well (ibid, p. 2-3).  A portfolio can also be a &quot;story-telling device&quot;, communicating a larger context of the students as represented by the works in the portfolio (ibid. p. 4).

==Personal Experience and Sample Grading/Assessment==
As an art therapist, I modify the program of studies (POS) of high school art curriculum to cater to the needs of my students who receive special education services for emotional disabilities. In addition, they can also have a variety of learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, autism, Asperger's Syndrome, etc.  They vary greatly in their cognitive and emotional intelligence.  In their IEP's, I concentrate on their social-emotional goals such as low-frustration tolerance, minimization of impulsive behavior, appropriate language and behavior, assessment of depression, mania, etc.  In any given class, I can have a mixture of students who are enrolled in Art 1, 2, 3, and Portfolio.  They also vary greatly in their individual artistic abilities.  My grading has to be simple yet encompass the ''important outcomes'' such as promoting a safe learning environment, creative self-expression through artmaking, mastery of techniques, risk-taking, choice-making, even house-keeping, and positive social-interactions, to name a few.  Our school has a behavioral system in place called Positive Behavior System (PBS), and it emphasizes the ''important outcomes'' of ''respect'', ''responsibility'', and ''positive attitude''.  These outcomes emphasize the importance of characteristics like respect for self, others, and property; responsibility of their actions and ownership of their learning; and promotion of positive attitude via cooperation and positive outlook.


For these reasons, '''70%''' of my art students' quarterly grade is based on ''class-participation''.  Every day, students can earn up to 10 points for their class participation grade.  The 10 points are based on factors such as being on time to class, setting up work in a timely manner, focus on work/task, productiveness, PBS behavior as described above, and cleaning-up after themselves.  Within a quarter, there are about 23 days to earn daily class participation points.  


At interim and at end of the quarter, students and their artwork are also assessed on the following ''important outcomes'' or '''IIPP's''' worth 25 points each for a total of 100 points, x 2 (interim &amp; end of quarter) for a total of 200 points per quarter.  IIPP's account for '''20%''' of quarter grades and stand for the following components: 

* '''&lt;u&gt;Initiative&lt;/u&gt;''' in starting work, which can include brainstorming ideas via thumbnail sketches or listing words in their journal-sketchbook; 
* '''&lt;u&gt;Investment&lt;/u&gt;''' or attitude and focus in their creative process;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Problem-Solving&lt;/u&gt;''' skills - are they willing and able to explore what they don't like about their project and work in a manner to fix the problem? Or do they give up due to their low-frustration tolerance or other reasons?;
* '''&lt;u&gt;Progress&lt;/u&gt;''' - were they able to complete or make sufficient progress on their work?  Did they persevere despite some difficulties? What did they learn as a result of this?


'''10%''' of their quarterly grade, then, is based on portfolio review.  For my classes, portfolio review is a way to show off all their work, to talk about their work, story-telling and summarizing their creative processes or insights about their work.  Are there any particular conceptual ideas that are common in their work?  Did they think their rendering was successful in trying to express their ideas and subject matter?  However, if they have not been successful in the IIPP's and class participation, or are stuck in their creative process, a portfolio review can be used as a formative assessment - to examine where they have been and decide where they want to go in terms of ideas and appropriate use of materials. It is also a way to assess what &quot;important outcomes&quot; are lacking and to set new goals to achieve.  I do not grade them on their artistic ability because this is too varying and this population is too sensitive to criticism or artistic &quot;critique&quot;.  If I thought the student was mature and confident in skills and self-esteem, I will provide oral feedback or suggestions.  Otherwise, they earn total amount of points for simply participating and risk-taking, which can be a huge step for some of these students.

If attendance is an issue, including extended suspensions, they may be assigned &quot;homework&quot;, otherwise I do not give outside assignments as this would set them up for failure.  They are encouraged to do research, but this rarely happens with this group of students.  This is another reason why I emphasize class participation and using studio/classtime wisely.


It seems that the research provided here does support my grading system for students I work with who possess varying levels of disabilities and abilities.  I always try to give students choices in their work, whether it is the topic (subject matter for their artmaking) and format (materials used).  I keep track of grades after each period or day, giving numeric grades.  It is calculated using points and for my class, weighted 70/20/10.  70% for class participation works because it does not matter if my students draw like 5-year-olds or 15-year-olds.  They are given clear expectations for working safely and productively in the environment of the art studio.  20% for IIPP's work, again, because it does not discrimate their level of artistic ability, but promote &quot;important outcomes&quot; through the creative process of artmaking and gives them some systematic feedback of their progress as well as point out their strengths and weaknesses, and help set goals for improvement.  10% for portfolio review is used both as a formative assessment and summative assessment, and gives further opportunities for self-expression.


Total earned points are turned into percentages, and then turned into letter grades for report cards according to my county's policies.  I have had to fail one student last year enrolled in Art 2 due to the fact that he produced very little and he did not seem to have any interest or motivation in using the art materials. Though it was recommended that he does not pursue art for the second year, he re-enrolled into my class, having barely passed his first year.  He was seemingly not upset about the grade, nor his mother, for that matter. But could I have a better grade system or perhaps a better structure of class for students like him to succeed in my class?  Did my class provide him with too many choices and open-ended format? This year, he continues to pop into the art studio stating that he wishes to stay instead of going to his next class.  He sits for a minute and verbalizes what (little) he did last year with fond memories.  Perhaps for him, he was not interested in art so much as the positive environment within it.  He was able to gain positive relationships with his peers and me, and perhaps that's what he needed the most, a sense of belonging.

'''By Ashley Wade'''




==&lt;font SIZE=8&gt;&lt;font color=#43BFC7 face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt; Learning Targets &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==
Students should be able to:

a) Define rubric.

b) Identify different types of rubrics.

c) Understand how to incorporate rubrics into grading.

==&lt;font SIZE=8&gt;&lt;font color=#43BFC7 face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt; What is a Rubric?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

So what is a rubric?  According to Goodrich, a rubric is “a scoring tool that lists the criteria for a piece of work or what counts.”  Through this scoring tool, teachers are able to determine how to grade their students work fairly and reasonably.  With the implementation of a rubric, students and their parents will also be able to “figure out how their [or their child's] project will be evaluated.”  Rubrics allow everyone to see what is being asked and what an individual is supposed to be doing.  One student even stated that they disliked rubrics because “if you get something wrong, your teacher can prove you knew what you were supposed to do.”  Usually “rubrics specify level of performance expected for several levels of quality.”  These are either titled as ratings, from excellent to poor, or as numerical scores, from zero to four.  From these two types of ratings, a teacher or instructor can total the scores to determine a final grade, ranging from an A to a F.  (What is a Rubric?, 2008)


==&lt;font SIZE=8&gt;&lt;font color=#43BFC7 face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt; Different Rubrics &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==

There are many different types of rubrics that have been developed.  Listed below are some of the main types of rubrics that can be used in the classroom.



'''Holistic'''

• Usually judges the assignment as a whole entity

• Usually very easy to use and can be created very quickly

• Associated with less feedback



'''Analytical'''

• Usually judges the assignment by its individual parts

• Usually harder and more time consuming to create

• Has more specific feedback



'''General or Generic''' 

• Usually scores assignments that have similar tasks

• Better for regular events or assignments, i.e. papers or science projects

• Easier to compare an individual’s progress over time



'''Task-specific'''

• Usually scores assignments that are unique and specific

• Better for just assigning grades

• Harder to create, yet get nothing in return either, such as feedback



==&lt;font SIZE=8&gt;&lt;font color=#43BFC7 face=&quot;mistral&quot;&gt; ...So which one is BEST for me? &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;==


&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: =#43BFC7 ;

By examining the various rubrics listed above, one can see that each is very specific to what kind of needs it can accommodate.  By using a general rubric, a teacher can grade a student's paper quickly, make the grading process easier, as well as making the student's expectations known at the same time.  If a teacher asked their student to put on a skit in front of the class, a more task-specific rubric could be developed in order to accommodate the specific ideas the teacher would want the student to present.  With rubrics, the teacher can make sure he/she grades all the students with the same intentions in mind, as well as lets the student know ahead of time what they will be graded on.  Simply put, rubrics are something that take time to get used to and create.  By looking at various rubrics that have already been made, a teacher can then determine which ones might benefit them most.  Even by including one's students in the process of creating a rubric can help to benefit all sides of the spectrum.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Summative &amp; Formative Testing in High School Earth Science&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

by Alec Bauserman

== Introduction ==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #8B0000;
border: solid 10px #b22222; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
 &lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;“''It is no use saying,'' 'We are doing our best.' '' '''You have got to succeed in &lt;u&gt;doing what is necessary&lt;/u&gt;&quot;''' ''.   --Winston Churchill&lt;/font color&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;



With the advent of the No Child Left Behind Act and the state's adoption of the SOLs, school-wide testing has taken the front seat in public education. Students have high expectations placed on them and they come under increased scrutiny to ensure they are on track to meet these goals. Pre-tests, midterms, post assessments, quizzes, tests, common assessments. The list is endless. Testing has not only become the desired 'ends,' but the 'means' as well. As school systems focus more and more on the benefits of varying forms of assessments, it is sensible that the teacher should also consider their options.  This paper will examine the varying forms of assessment available to the high school science teacher, with specific examples provided for earth science.

== Learning Targets ==
By the conclusion of this article, the reader will be able to:
&lt;li&gt; recognize and explain the different forms of assessment
&lt;li&gt; list pro's and con's of each type of assessment
&lt;li&gt; be able to define performance assessments, cite benefits &amp; give examples&lt;/li&gt;

== Reasons for Assessment ==
Before we examine the types of assessments, we must first understand WHY assessments are given in the first place. Traditionally, a teacher would give a test at the end of a unit to measure how successful they were in imparting the material to their students. They'd grade the test, hand it back &amp; move on. These days tests are used for more than just determining how much a student learned or how hard they studied. Teachers give a quiz or other assignment to AID the learning process, not just measure it. Tests given at the end of a unit to determine how much a student learned are called ''summative'' assessments. Tests given along the way which are used to assist the learning process (and not just to measure the results) are named ''formative'' assessments 

''Summative'' = assessment '''OF''' learning

''Formative'' = assessment '''FOR''' learning

Both of these have a place in the classroom. Formative assessments are given midway through a lesson. They help students understand the material and they help teachers determine how quickly the student's are picking up the material. By assigning a grade to them, teachers make it 'worthwhile' for the students to put forth their full effort. If the teacher makes the assessment a collective effort with students working in pairs or small groups, the students benefit from peer-to-peer dialogue and the students who have gained a better understanding can impart their knowledge to the students who haven't yet mastered the subject matter. By the time the teacher reaches the end of the unit, a summative assessment can be given, each student working with only their knowledge. They should be comfortable in their understanding and confident in the their responses. The grade will be counted and the class will move on.

== Types of Assessment ==
'''Summative Assessment''' - a summative assessment is given at the end of a unit to determine just how much each student gained from the lessons. A summative assessment can take many forms, but in a secondary science class they are usually one of the following:

&lt;li&gt; a chapter test
&lt;li&gt; an essay
&lt;li&gt; a project&lt;/li&gt;

Each of these has its own strengths and weaknesses. '''Chapter tests''' are the most common but not necessarily the most effective means of testing a student's knowledge and the application of that knowledge. Tests are good in that they can take many forms - selected response (multiple choice, true-false, matching), short answer, fill in the blank, etc. A more diverse test with a wide range of question types is useful. On the other hand it is a form of putting all one's eggs in a single basket. A bad night before the test, classroom disruption during the test, a poorly written question... All of these can lead to lower student scores which do not accurately reflect a student's true grasp of the material. I have personally given tests where I ''knew'' for a fact that the student knew the material yet were unable to answer the question due to poor wording on my part. As such, a summative chapter test is not always the most effective way to determine academic progress.

An '''essay''' also has its pros and cons. On the one hand it is useful in that a student may take their time and think through their response. They can consult with the teacher or other students to improve their response. By writing out their thoughts, it is readily apparent to the teacher whether or not the student understands the material. A monkey with a pencil will occasionally score well on a multiple-choice test but its is much harder to fake understanding with a constructed response like an essay. In this way, essays make good summative assessments. On the other hand, they are difficult for students with poor writing skills. I teach freshmen and many of them struggle to write coherent sentences and develop a linear argument. A student may perfectly understand the material they were taught yet fail the essay simply because they are not effective writers. &lt;table WIDTH=&quot;47%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #ffd700;
border: solid 10px #800000; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=center&gt; [[Image:Ridge_render.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (cross section).]]

&lt;big&gt;'' Sample Earth Science CFA questions&lt;/small&gt; ''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;With your partner, discuss the physical features of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, its origin and its potential future effects. Explain these features with your knowledge of convection currents in the Earth's mantle. In what way does the MAR relate to the Theory of Plate Tectonics? Construct a response in 5-paragraph form, no less than 2 pages long. One partner is responsible for typing, the other will present their findings to the class. See the rubric for details.&quot;  -Mr Bauserman

EXPLANATION - This CFA is designed to benefit students in several ways:
&lt;li&gt;provide peer interaction
&lt;li&gt;assist students learn content
&lt;li&gt;provide teacher-student dialogue
&lt;li&gt;enhance writing &amp; public-speaking&lt;/li&gt;
I have found these CFAs to be fun, useful, and wholly beneficial to instruction. They don't take too much time and they increase students' confidence in their learning.
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; A '''project''' has many qualities which make it an attractive choice for summative assessment. They do not depend on a single days effort, but rather a long time period. They allow students to revise and improve their work. They help students learn as they create it. They are often fun to do (for some) and students take a lot of pride in their work. They can be tailor-made to answer the teachers questions and a rubric can help the students design an good submission. Unfortunately, they often take too much time and students will often wait until the day before to start. A heap of quickly made, poorly constructed projects is a nightmare for a teacher to grade, even with an effective rubric. Also, because each chapter or unit is only so long, the project must usually be described weeks in advance. For teachers constantly pressed for time, this takes a lot of effort and foresight to be successful. 

'''Formative Assessment''' - a formative assessment is given during instruction in order to 1) help the student learn the material and 2) aid the teacher in determining how well the students understand the material. It is often termed an &quot;assessment '''for''' learning.&quot; A few examples of formative assessments I've given my high school earth science &amp; biology classes are:

&lt;li&gt; presentations
&lt;li&gt; Common Formative Assessment (CFA)
&lt;li&gt; examination &amp; discussion of articles &lt;/li&gt;

A '''presentation''' is a great example of a formative assessment. Students are assigned a topic to present to the class, either individually or in groups, most often using Powerpoint. The students learn the material as they study it, condense it, and package it into a form easily understood by their peers. It is often said that the best way to learn something is to approach it as though you would need to teach it to someone. A presentation is just such an example. Students must research and understand the material well enough to teach it and answer basic questions on it. The drawback is that in any group, some will work hard and others just enough to get by. The learning is not always equal. Additionally, teachers must develop a rubric, grade the resulting presentations, and patch up any holes in the student's instruction. It can often take more time than just teaching 'the old fashioned way.'

The term '''CFA''' has several meanings but in my class I use it to refer to a group quiz that is given to aid student understanding. I will typically present a graphic or animation that contains material covered in the last few days (or weeks if possible) and ask several &quot;knowledge&quot; questions and several &quot;application&quot; questions. These are helpful because our Virginia SOLs are graph- and graphic-heavy so I make every effort to expose my students to these. We will discuss the answers afterward and the students grade each others papers. This cuts down on the teacher's workload. Drawbacks are few, but the most common is that one group member does most of the work and the others daydream. Even so, I have found these to be effective and I will continue to use them in my instruction. 

Recent online and in-print '''news articles''' offer a great avenue to provide formative assessments. Students are given a handout, no more than a page or two, with a news article pertaining to the current topic in the class.  They are to read it and answer some basic questions. The article provides students with a real-world example of the topic's relevance and the discussion afterwards helps students to understand what they read. Reading comprehension is benefited and they can discuss their personal opinion on the subject. The downside is that it is difficult to find articles that have enough topic-specific vocabulary yet are on a reading level suitable for high schoolers. The article is often too easy or too hard, or requires a lot of background knowledge and prior explanation. Even so, articles are fun to use and benefit the students who read them

== Performance assessment ==

''&quot;...the '''application of knowledge, skills, and work habits''' through the performance of tasks that are meaningful and engaging to students&quot; '' (Hibbard and others, 1996)

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;60%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FCDFFF;
border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
&lt;big&gt; ''What are the benefits of a '''performance assessment''' ?''&lt;/big&gt; 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;[T]hey '''''evaluate thinking skills''''' such as analysis, synthesis, evaluation, and interpretation of facts and ideas — skills which standardized tests generally avoid.
&lt;li&gt;They are '''''flexible''''' enough to allow teachers to evaluate each child's progress using information obtained from ongoing classroom interactions with materials and peers. 
&lt;li&gt;They are a means for '''''improving instruction''''', allowing teachers to plan a comprehensive, developmentally oriented curriculum based on their knowledge of each child.
&lt;li&gt;They provide valuable, in-depth '''''information''''' for parents, administrators, and other policy makers.
&lt;li&gt;They put responsibility for '''''monitoring''''' what children are learning — and what teachers are teaching — in the hands of teachers, where it belongs.&quot;&lt;/ul&gt;

Meisels, S.J. (2008). &quot;Teacher's Timely Topics: Performance Assessment.&quot; Retrieved from http://teacher.scholastic.com Oct 28, 2008. 
[http://teacher.scholastic.com/professional/assessment/perfassess.htm (link)]
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Regardless of the purpose for testing, a teacher should always feel comfortable giving a performance-based assessment. By asking the students to show their accumulated knowledge and skills, a teacher can assess the students formatively or summatively. Performance assessments can take many forms; many have already been mentioned above. Speeches, presentations, projects, activities, games... Any activity where a student must ''do'' something other than filling out a test can be considered a performance assessment. They may be performed individually or in groups, they can be formal (count for a grade) or be informal. They may be used to test a students progress (summative) or be used to assist in the learning process (formative). 

Some of the benefits of using performance-based assessments are in the table to the right. Generally speaking, a performance assessment is most beneficial in giving the teacher a better understanding of student mastery as compared to a standard, selected-response summative test. McLaughlin and Warren found that these assessments were effective when given to student's with disabilities (McLaughlin, M.J. and Warren, S.H., 2008). 

For the assessment to be effective, however, the teacher must first do two things:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clearly define the skill-set or body of knowledge to be tested
&lt;li&gt;Create a clear rubric for the students to work with&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Teachers who attempt to give a performance-based assessment and are displeased with the results often failed to do one these two things. By having muddled goals or unclear standards of expectations, both the teacher and students become frustrated and the assessment is in vain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
To perform an XQuery on XHTML files that use the XHTML namespace.

== Method ==
We will start our XQuery by adding the default namespace for XHTML.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
   declare default element namespace &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Source Code ==

Assume that you have an well-formed XHTML file in the file /db/text/index.xhtml

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
 
declare default element namespace &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;;
 
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=html media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;
 
let $doc := doc('/db/test/index.xhtml')
let $body := $doc/html/body/*
 
return
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Replace Head&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      {$body}
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rationale for Educational and Ethical Aspects==

Just started this chapter; then had to travel on trip of about 3000 km.
Just back to see that there is a note requesting clarification and rationale...

I need to get some sleep now.
Hope to do the rationale soon.

==Query removed==
{{tlx|query}}

Thanx for the query in the first place. It forced me to look at this particular module today. In fact, a co-author had insisted on the issue of education and ethics to be included. So the title was entered and the aircraft then boarded.
I expect to be able to expand on this module today.

'''Consommé''' is made by beating egg whites into cold stock, then heating it to just below a simmer for 15 minutes.  As the egg white heats up it coagulates and in the process it encloses all the minute cloudy particles.  These rise to the surface and are skimmed off, leaving a clear broth beneath.

The stock must be thoroughly degreased beforehand. This is done by refrigerating the stock and removing the solidified fat.  The rest of the fat is then removed by warming the stock, then when the fat has melted, laying a sheet of paper towel on the surface.  Because fat has a lower surface tension than water, the paper will absorb the fat.&lt;ref&gt; M. J. Lewis (1990), ''Physical Properties of Foods and Food Processing Systems'', Woodhead Publishing ISBN 1855732726, digitized by Google&lt;/ref&gt;  Remove the paper and discard.  Repeat with a fresh sheet if necessary.

[[Image:Austrian Dish 5.JPG|right|thumb|300px|''Consommé'']]
==Ingredients==

* 1 quart (950ml) chicken, veal or beef stock
* salt and pepper
* A 2½ quart (2.3 litres) saucepan
* 2 egg whites
&lt;br/&gt;
*5 layers of well washed dampened cheesecloth
*a colander
*a 3-quart (2.9 litres) bowl
*a ladle
*⅓ cup (85ml) Madeira, port or cognac

==Procedure==

# Having degreased the stock thoroughly, taste it for seasoning and add salt if necessary.  If the consommé is to be served cold, over-salt slightly as more is needed for a cold dish.
# Beat a cup of stock with the egg whites in a large bowl.
# Bring the rest of the stock to a simmer in the saucepan.
# While beating the egg white mixture, gradually pour the stock into the egg whites in a thin stream.
# Pour the stock back into the saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
# While it is heating, stir it with a wire whisk.
#Immediately the stock reaches simmering point, stop stirring.
# Move the pot to the edge of the flame and continue heating over a low flame for 5 minutes.
# Turn the pot a quarter turn and heat for 5 minutes, turn again after 5 minutes and once again for a final 5 minutes.
#Line a colander with the dampened cheesecloth and place it over the bowl.
#Carefully ladle the stock and egg whites into the colander, agitating the egg whites as little as possible.
#When finished, allow it to drain for 5 or 6 minutes.
#Remove the colander and stir the wine or cognac into the consommé.

20:43, 11 May 2008 68.41.167.143 (Talk) (2,541 bytes) (quotes are NOT expected by the IB...)

While quotations are not ''expected'' by the IBO, per say, it provides the icing on the cake for a solid paper. Many texts often have key quotations that are analyzed in depth in class, and incorporating one or two lines from your novel into your essay can cement your argument, as you can illustrate how your points parallel what the author was trying to say.[[User:Akademix|Akademix]] ([[User talk:Akademix|talk]]) 20:31, 26 August 2008 (UTC)
 
Whomever wrote this is a pretentious fool.  Why use &quot;utilize&quot; when &quot;use&quot; is so vastly less self-aggrandizing yet exactly the same?

As per the question about novelists and their favor of characters, this is not even close to a typical IB question.  IB will NEVER ask you about the author him/herself, as that would imply that it was expected that you study the actual author.  IB questions may ask you about the VOICE expressed in a particular work, as that is a literary technique employed BY authors (novelists).  Also, &quot;How far&quot; is not an IB command term, so you will never, ever see it in an exam question.</text>

=== Introduction ===
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;Upon entering college, students are required to take college placement tests.  These tests determine the student's level of readiness regarding college-level work, often in the core classes of Mathematics and English.  Surprisingly, approximately half of all students entering college score below the minimum.  For these students, colleges provide remedial classes in that specific subject area.  These classes help the students acquire the skills and knowledge-base that are needed prior to taking the college entry-level class for that core subject area. (EduGuide, 2008). &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

=== Type of Assessment ===
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;College placement tests are a form of criterion-referenced assessment.  In this type of assessment, &quot;test scores [translate] into a statement about the behavior to be expected of a person with that score or their relationship to a specified subject matter&quot; (Wikipedia, 2008).  Criterion referenced assessments are also referred to as standards-based assessments.  The assessment is used to determine whether the student has sufficiently learned the material for which he/she is being tested.  The ACT, a standardized achievement examination for college admission, is an example of this type of assessment (Wikipedia, 2008).  The two most common college placement tests, COMPASS and ACCUPLACER, are also examples of criterion-referenced assessment (Achieve, Inc., 2007). &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;''identify areas of strength and areas of weakness''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;big&gt;''determine readiness for college level course work''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;College placement tests primarily serve to determine whether a student has the developed the knowledge and/or skills needed to take the college entry-level courses in a specific subject area.  These tests notify the college of the students strengths and weaknesses in that subject area.  For instance, if a student has taken a placement test in Mathematics, the test may show that the student understands pre-algebra since he answered all, or most, related questions correctly.  However, that same student may struggle in algebra since he answered a significant proportion of related questions incorrectly.  The main objective of the college placement test is to identify key problems in core subject areas before the student's education progress is disrupted (ACT, Inc., 2008).
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;COMPASS is an untimed, computerized placement test that is managed by the same company that administers the ACT test.  It is used by many colleges throughout the United States.  Tests offered by COMPASS include reading, mathematics, writing skills, writing essay (e-write), and English as a Second Language (ESL).  Upon completion of this placement test, students are not only immediately notified of their score, but also receive information regarding the courses for which they should register (ACT, Inc., 2008).&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;

&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Reading&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;The Reading Placement Test consists of five types of reading comprehension passages - Practical Reasoning, Prose Fiction, Humanities, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences (ACT, Inc., 2008).  The adjacent link is an excellent example of a Humanities passage.  It includes two multiple-choice questions which address referring and reasoning skills.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Mathematics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;The Mathematics Placement Test consists of multiple choice questions which test five mathematical areas - Numerical Skills/Pre-Algebra, Algebra, College Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry.  Each mathematical placement area tests for basic skills, application, and analysis (ACT, Inc., 2008).  The adjacent link exemplifies the kind of questions that would be found on the Numerical Skills/Pre-Algebra Placement Test.  The four multiple choice questions test all three areas - basic skills, application, and analysis. &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Writing Skills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;The Writing Skills Placement Test consists of essays that each contain various errors.  At the end of each essay, there are multiple choice questions which test knowledge and skills in two key content categories - Usage/Mechanics and Rhetorical Skills.  Usage/Mechanics includes punctuation, basic grammar and usage, as well as, sentence structure.  Rhetorical Skills includes strategy, organization, and style (ACT, Inc., 2008).  The adjacent link is an excellent representation of a sample essay and questions set that students would find on the Writing Skills Placement Test.  The four multiple choice questions following the essay address four of the six areas found under the content categories.  The first and third questions test the students on two different areas concerning Usage/Mechanics; whereas, the second and fourth questions test two different areas concerning Rhetorical Skills. &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;



&lt;font color=&quot;842DCE&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
=== ACCUPLACER ===
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
==== Introduction ====
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;ACCUPLACER, a computer adaptive test, is used by colleges' academic advisors, counselors, and Registrar's Offices to decide course selection for students.  It is used in conjunction with the student's academic background and ambitions.  While the multiple-choice tests are untimed, the essay test can be either timed or untimed.  Tests offered by ACCUPLACER include reading, writing, mathematics, and English as a Second Language (ESL).  Upon completion of any of the ACCUPLACER placement tests, students receive an immediate score report from the college (College Board, 2008).&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;
==== Sample Test Questions ====
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;The ACCUPLACER Placement Tests address seven key areas of academics in reading, writing, language use, mathematics, and English as a Second Language.  The seven components include Sentence Skills, Reading Comprehension, an Arithmetic Test, Elementary Algebra, a College Level Math Test, a Written Essay, and ESL Testing (College Board, 2008).  Examples of each can be found in the following link: &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;u&gt;English as a Second Language (ESL)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;The ESL Placement Test is for those students who have learned English as a second language, or in addition to their native language.  This placement test assesses the student's skills in English.  The test is divided into five sections, each examining a different area of English.  The five sections include ESL Reading Skills, ESL Language Use, ESL Sentence Meaning, WritePlacer ESL, and ESL Listening.  Students can be required to take one or more of these sections, as determined by the college or university (College Board, 2008).  &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;big&gt;''&quot;When colleges offer several options for writing placement, they demonstrate sensitivity to the various needs new students have; however, fair and appropriate placement is potentially more complex than even these many options reveal.&quot; (Di Gennaro, 2008, p. 62)'' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot; face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;In the United States, there is an increase in the number of students seeking higher education who are considered non-native English speakers.  As a result, the heavy reliance on, and reliability of, college writing placement tests in determining student placement into writing courses is of grave concern.  Many colleges and universities offer different placement alternatives.  Examples of these include, but are not limited to, ESL (English as a Second Language) writing sections, developmental and/or basic writing courses, and freshman/first-year composition.  However, these alternatives just simply are not enough (Di Gennaro, 2007, p. 62). 


Generation 1.5 is a term coined by Linda Harklau, Kay Losey, and Meryl Siegal, in their 1999 book.  Generation 1.5 learners are commonly described as students for whom English is a second language (L2); however, they have often completed their secondary school education in the United States prior to attending college (Di Gennaro, 2007, p.65).  Furthermore, Generation 1.5 learners have received the majority, if not all, of their formal education in English; whereas, L2 students have had their primary, and even part of their secondary, school education in their native language Di Genarro, 2007, p. 66).  According to Di Genarro (2007), writing program administrators should do more than simply recognize the different types of learners for whom English is a second language.  &quot;We must also adopt or design assessment procedures to help us identify these different groups of learners if we are to provide them with the most appropriate placement options, ensuring that our tests serve as door-openers rather than gate-keepers&quot; (Di Genarro, 2007, p. 75).    
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== ''Conclusion'' ==
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;font face=&quot;BOOKMAN OLD STYLE&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;College placement tests are criterion-referenced assessments used by colleges and universities across the United States.  Of the many different placement tests available, COMPASS and ACCUPLACER are the most commonly used.  These tests not only assess student readiness in core college classes, but also determine academic areas of strength and weakness for each student.  Reading, writing, mathematics, and ESL are the most common areas of testing by colleges and universities.  For each of these areas, there are advantages, as well as, disadvantages.  However, colleges and universities continue to require college placement tests, thus implying that the advantages strongly outweigh the disadvantages.  The controversy continues over the benefits and drawbacks of college placement tests, especially for ESL and Generation 1.5 learners.&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

'''Giblets'''  are the edible offal of a fowl, typically including the heart, gizzard, liver and other visceral organs. 

A whole bird from a butcher is often packaged with the giblets (sometimes sealed in a bag in the body cavity).  Although it does not technically fit the definition above, the neck is often included with the giblets, as it must be separated from the body during the process of butchering. 

There are a number of recipes that use giblets. If a bird is to be stuffed, the giblets are traditionally chopped and added to the stuffing, however the USDA recommends cooking giblets separate from the bird. If not, they can be used for other purposes, such as ''giblet pie'' or, a Southern favorite, giblet gravy.  With the exception of giblet gravy, the liver is not usually included in these recipes, as its strong flavor tends to overpower other ingredients.  It may be used in liver-specific recipes, such as pâté or yakitori. Giblets can also be used to make alicot, a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] stew.

Much poultry, especially that sold in supermarkets, is quartered and consequently the giblets are not included.  Giblets can be bought separately from a butcher, but the demand for human consumption is low in most Western countries, so they are more often sold to pet food manufacturers.

Seems to me like many of these textbook reviews are put out simply to increase sales.I have not perused many of the texts, so I cannot verify any of the claims, but some of the blurbs seem suspect. [[User:Akademix|Akademix]] ([[User talk:Akademix|talk]]) 22:04, 26 August 2008 (UTC)

:Well, we should tag the 'suspect' articles as such - [[w:Wikipedia:ADVERT]] has some guidelines. 

:There's a wikipedia template, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{advert}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; we could copy to wikibooks if it's necessary.

:Instead of a section on reviews, it should simply list the IB textbooks and an overview of their contents.

'''Fortified wines''' are wines to which additional alcohol, usually brandy, has been added.

The original reason for fortifying wine was to preserve it. Alcohol is a natural preservative, and when added before the fermentation of wine is complete, it kills the yeast and leaves residual sugar behind as well as preventing contamination by spoilage organisms. The end result is a wine that is both sweeter and stronger, normally containing about 20% alcohol by volume (ABV). When the perfection of bottling methods made fortification no longer necessary, fortification nevertheless continued because wine drinkers had acquired a liking for this kind of wine.

Fortified wines include:

{{ingredient}}

'''Madeira''' is a fortified wine made in the Madeira Islands, Portugal, which is made in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own as an aperitif, to sweet wines more usually consumed with dessert. Cheaper versions are often used in cooking. Due to the unique maturation process the wines undergo, they are especially long-lived.</text>

'''Sherry''' is a fortified wine, made in and around the town of Jerez, Spain. Hence in Spanish it is called &quot;Vino de Jerez;&quot; in fact, the word &quot;sherry&quot; is an Anglicized version of the town's name. According to Spanish law, Sherry must come from the small triangular area of the province of Cádiz between Jerez, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa María. In earlier times Sherry was known as sack (a rendering of the Spanish saca, meaning a removal from the solera), or more fully as Sherris sack.

Sherry differs from other wines because of how it is treated after fermentation. After fermentation is complete, it is fortified with brandy. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, all natural sherries are dry; any sweetness is applied later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through fermentation, stopping fermentation so not all the sugars are allowed to turn into alcohol and so leaving a sweet wine.</text>

'''Marsala''' is a wine produced in the region surrounding the Italian city of Marsala in Sicily. Marsala wine first received Denominazione di origine controllata, or DOC, status in 1969.

While the city's natives sometimes drink &quot;vintage&quot; Marsala, the wine produced for export is universally a fortified wine similar to port. Marsala wine was originally fortified with ethanol, or alcohol, to ensure that it would last long ocean voyages, but it is made that way now due to its popularity in foreign markets.

'''Port wine''' (also known as '''Vinho do Porto''', '''Oporto''', '''Porto''', and often simply '''Port''') is a Portuguese, fortified wine from the Douro Valley in the northern provinces of Portugal. It is typically a sweet wine, but comes as dry or semi-dry too. It is often served as a dessert wine. Wines in the style of the Portuguese product called port are produced around the world in several countries—most notably Australia, South Africa, India, Canada, Argentina and the United States. However, under European Union guidelines, only the product from Portugal may be labelled as Port. In the United States, Federal law mandates that the Portuguese-made product be labeled Porto or Vinho do Porto.

Port is produced from grapes grown and processed in the Douro region. The wine produced is then fortified with the addition of a Brandy (distilled grape spirits), in order to stop the fermentation leaving residual sugar in the wine and to boost the alcohol content. The wine is then stored and aged, often in barrels stored in caves (Portuguese meaning &quot;cellars&quot;) as is the case in Vila Nova de Gaia, before being bottled. The wine received its name, &quot;Port,&quot; in the latter half of the 17th century from the seaport city of Porto at the mouth of the Douro River, where much of the product was brought to market or for export to other countries in Europe from the Leixões docks. The Douro valley where Port wine is produced was defined and established as a protected region, or appellation in 1756 — making it the oldest defined and protected wine region in the world.

{{cooknav}} | [[Cookbook:Ingredients|Ingredients]]

'''Vermouth''' (also spelled vermuth) is a fortified wine flavored with aromatic herbs and spices (&quot;aromatized&quot; in the trade) using closely-guarded recipes (trade secrets). Some vermouth is sweetened; however, unsweetened, or dry, vermouth tends to be bitter. The person credited with the first vermouth recipe, Antonio Benedetto Carpano from Turin, Italy, chose to name his concoction &quot;vermouth&quot; in 1786 because he was inspired by a German wine flavored with wormwood, a herb most famously used in distilling absinthe. The modern German word Wermut (Wermuth in the spelling of Carpano's time) means both wormwood and vermouth. The herbs were originally used to mask raw flavors of cheaper wines, imparting a slightly medicinal &quot;tonic&quot; flavor.

===Styles===

There are three general styles of vermouth, in order from driest to sweetest: extra dry, bianco/white, and sweet/red. Sweet red vermouth is drunk as an apéritif, often straight up, as well as in mixed drinks like the Manhattan. Dry white vermouth, along with gin, is a key ingredient in the mixing of martinis. Red vermouths are sometimes referred to as Italian vermouths and white vermouths as French vermouths, although not all Italian vermouths are red and not all white vermouths are French.

'''Pudding''' most often refers to a dessert, but can also be a savory dish. There are two main types.

The word pudding probably comes from the French boudin, originally from the Latin botellus, meaning &quot;small sausage,&quot; referring to encased meats used in Medieval European puddings. In the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, pudding is a common term for any dessert.

==Baked, Steamed and Boiled Puddings==

The first type of pudding is a solid mass formed by mixing various ingredients with a grain product or another binder (e.g., batter, flour, cereal, blood, eggs, suet). These puddings are cooked by baking, steaming or boiling.

This type of pudding is still common in various places and is served as either a main-course dish or a dessert. In Australia, pudding is usually used to describe this type, though the term also may be used to refer to the second type (see below) as well. These are less common in North America.

Many puddings of this type resemble cakes, characteristically with more moisture and usually served in chunks rather than slices. Others are types of sausages. Dessert pudding is often accompanied by custard or ice cream.

Boiled pudding was a common main course aboard ships in the Royal Navy in the 18th and 19th centuries. Pudding was used as the primary dish in which daily rations of flour and suet were prepared.

===Suet Pudding===

Steamed pies consisting of a filling completely enclosed by suet pastry are also known as puddings. These may be sweet or savoury and include such dishes as steak and kidney pudding.

==Cream Puddings==

The second and newer type of pudding consists of sugar, milk, and a thickening agent such as cornstarch, gelatin, eggs, rice or tapioca to create a sweet, creamy dessert. These puddings are made either by simmering on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler or by baking in an oven, often in a bain-marie. They are typically served chilled, but a few types, such as zabaglione and rice pudding, may be served warm.

This is the most familiar meaning of the term in North America and some European countries such as the Netherlands, whilst in Britain egg-thickened puddings are considered custards and starch-thickened puddings are blanc-mange. Pudding may be made from scratch or a mix or may be purchased ready to eat. The gelatin dessert company Jell-O is the primary producer of pudding mixes and prepared puddings in North America.

{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]

'''Dough''' ('''''Pâte''''' in French, '''''Pasta''''' in Italian) is a paste made out of the flour of any cereal (grain) or leguminous food, moistened and kneaded but not baked. This step is a precursor to its use in cooking in numerous ways such as making bread, pasta, noodles, pastry, cookies and muffins among other uses.  Dough differs from batter in having a lower water content. 

===Gluten===

The elasticity of dough depends on its gluten content. Gluten is a  greyish complex of water-insoluble proteins occurring in wheat and other cereals and is composed chiefly of the proteins gliadin and glutenin.  The chainlike molecules form an elastic network that traps carbon dioxide from the leavening agent, expanding with it. The gluten content of flour varies from 7% to 15% and is dependant both on variety and on the weather. For bread making, a high gluten content is desirable but for other baked goods, where lightness is a desirable quality, lower gluten doughs are preferred. All-purpose flour attempts to strike a happy medium between the extremes of bread flour and pastry flour through the mixing of different varieties.  In some recipes, the gluten content of dough is attenuated through the use of cornstarch or other refined starch products which are gluten free.

To make bread from cereals with low gluten content, some alternative means of providing an elastic structure is necessary.  This can be supplied by the protein in eggs or by precooking all or part of the flour to produce a gelatinous mass which can then be leavened and baked afterwards. Alternatively, flour from the low-gluten cereal may be mixed with high gluten wheat flour.

==Kneading==
[[Image:Cirdingis36.gif|right|thumb|200px|Kneading]]

This is the process of working a dough to develop the elasticity of the gluten.  This can be done by hand, the traditional method, or with an electric mixer equipped with a dough hook.  The way ingredients are mixed affects the final product.  The dough must be well mixed to combine the ingredients uniformly, with a uniform texture, as well as effectively developing the gluten and distributing the yeast throughout. If this is not done, the texture and shape of the final product will suffer.  The dough should be kneaded until it is smooth and moderately elastic. The presence of one or two bubbles beneath the surface of the dough is a sign that the dough is sufficiently well kneaded. Fat and sugar have a tendency to slow the development of gluten, so rich breads may require longer kneading. Over-kneading may result in a sticky dough but this is rarely a problem except with powerful commercial mixers.

==Methods of making yeast dough==


Basically, there are two methods for making yeast doughs:

===Straight Dough Method===
This method consists of simply combining the ingredients and mixing them.  The yeast may or may not first be activated by mixing with sugar and warm water. The temperature of the water should not exceed 136ºF or the yeast may be killed.  Once the ingredients are mixed, the dough is kneaded until smooth and elastic. Kneading time depends on the type of dough being made.

===Sponge Method===
[[Image:Mother-culture.png|right|thumb|Sponge]]
This method has two stages. First the yeast, liquid and about half the flour are mixed to a batter called a '''sponge'''.  This is left to rise until it becomes foamy and has increased in volume to double or more. In the second stage, the rest of the flour plus any fat, salt and sugar are added and the dough is kneaded and allowed to rise. This gives the bread a lighter texture and a slightly different flavour.  This should not be confused with sourdough bread in which a &quot;starter' is used to make the bread and reserved for later use.  The sponge method is particularly useful in improving the texture of heavy doughs like rye.

===Punching Down===
[[Image:Cirdingis43.gif|right|thumb|150px|Portioning]]
After the dough has risen, it is sometimes folded and kneaded a second time to redistribute the gas and help relax the gluten more. This is known as '''punching down''' the dough.

===Portioning===
[[Image:Cabbage loaves proving Faîs'sie d'Cidre 2007.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Proofing]]

The dough is now ready to be divided into portions.  For loaves the dough is either shaped into an oval and laid flat on a baking sheet. Alternatively, a loaf may be baked in a bread pan.  If rolls are to be made, the dough is shaped into a log and then pieces are cut off which are then shaped into rounds or ovals. At this stage the dough is '''rounded''' by tucking it under itself to produce a nice round surface which helps it to bake and rise evenly.

===Proofing===

The final stage before baking dough is '''proofing'''. This is the final rising period and is done at a temperature of between 70ºF and 85ºF.  This can be done in a '''proof box''' in which temperature and humidity are controlled.  Proofing is complete when the product has doubled in size and springs back slowly when lightly touched.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A credit card is a system of payment named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system. In the case of credit cards, the issuer lends money to the consumer (or the user) to be paid later to the merchant. It is different from a charge card, which requires the balance to be paid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers to 'revolve' their balance, at the cost of having interest charged. Most credit cards are issued by local banks or credit unions, and are the same shape and size, as specified by the ISO 7810 standard.Credit cards are issued after an account has been approved by the credit provider, after which cardholders can use it to make purchases at merchants accepting that card.

When a purchase is made, the credit card user agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates his/her consent to pay, by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a Personal identification number (PIN). Also, many merchants now accept verbal authorizations via telephone and electronic authorization using the Internet, known as a 'Card/Cardholder Not Present' (CNP) transaction.

Electronic verification systems allow merchants to verify that the card is valid and the credit card customer has sufficient credit to cover the purchase in a few seconds, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a credit card payment terminal or Point of Sale (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's acquiring bank. Data from the card is obtained from a magnetic stripe or chip on the card; the latter system is in the United Kingdom and Ireland commonly known as Chip and PIN, but is more technically an EMV card.

Other variations of verification systems are used by e Commerce merchants to determine if the user's account is valid and able to accept the charge. These will typically involve the cardholder providing additional information, such as the security code printed on the back of the card, or the address of the cardholder.

Each month, the credit card user is sent a statement indicating the purchases undertaken with the card, any outstanding fees, and the total amount owed. After receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges that he or she thinks are incorrect (see Fair Credit Billing Act for details of the US regulations). Otherwise, the cardholder must pay a defined minimum proportion of the bill by a due date, or may choose to pay a higher amount up to the entire amount owed. The credit provider charges interest on the amount owed (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). Some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the user's bank accounts, thus avoiding late payment altogether as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.

«Play is older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing. We can safely assert, even, that human civilization has added no essential feature to the general idea of play. Animals play just like men.»&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga 1955, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Culture and Playing and Games and Theatre and ... are all interlinked.
We want this to be a fun book where all of this happens digitally with backlinks to the &quot;real&quot; world.
Such [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink backlinks] (i.e. linking back) are thought of as being in the realm of &quot;physicality of soul&quot;.


==Physicality of Soul==
If one compares the Internet activity with the activity of Soul, then the grounding of such Internet activity in physical spaces
is compared directly with the grounding of the &quot;spiritual&quot; in its own reality. An example might help.


==Play on stage==
Someone writes a play. Some players put on the performance. During the performance, everything is play-acting. It is a sort of dream world
for the players. They are &quot;out of the body&quot; so to speak. It is &quot;make believe&quot; and for the play to work, the audience must also must enter into the spirit of &quot;make-belief&quot;. After the play, there is a coming down to earth, to reality. But the play has happened, has been experienced. This experience will color, will affect both players and audience for ever after. This is the intended meaning of the concept of &quot;physicality of soul&quot;. 

To illustrate this idea, let us take a look at some plays. We begin with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Doll's_House A Doll's House].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The message loop can't run this way: while( (bRet = GetMessage( &amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0 )) != 0).
The condition must be while &gt; 0. Because if you get an error, the GetMessage function will return negative number and if you treat it like an ordinary message, you will get into more errors, which might be fatal. I haven't fixed anything because I don't want to break author's idea, but I think that's a mistake.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
This chapter explains how to extend the out-of-the-box feature set of Mewa Film with MFX files. MFX files encapsulate node behavior, they can be used to create specific image processing algorithms, to create 3D effects, and much more. Once a MFX file is imported it become accessible to the node graph using the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Main_window#Nodes_toolbar|nodes toolbar]], like any other node. 

To create a MFX file you must have knowledge on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLSL GLSL] programming and understand [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML XML].

MFX files use GLSL shaders to apply effects over images or a 3D scene. For those who don't know, GLSL is a high level shading language to create effects that run on graphics hardware, and so, using MFX files you can create your own effects very quickly and achieve a degree of performance only offered by accelerated hardware.

Because MFX files are dependent on the graphics hardware, older graphics hardware might not support all MFX files.

==What is a MFX file?==
An MFX file is called MFX because it's file name ends with ''.mfx''. An MFX file holds the GLSL source code and a description of the GUI controls that manipulate the effect.

For artists and developers of real-time graphics, this format provides cross-platform compatibility of an effect with behaviour and GUI descriptions embedded in one file. 

GLSL developers can describe a complete rendering effect in a ''.mfx'' file. Although individual MFX programs may contain the core rendering algorithms necessary for an effect, only when combined with this additional environmental information does the shader become complete and self contained. The addition of artist-friendly GUI descriptions and fallbacks enables MFX files to integrate well with the production workflow used by artists and programmers.

To better understand how to create MFX files lets analyse the [[Mewa_Film_User's_Guide/Nodes_Reference/UnderwaterEffect_node#Source|underwater effect]] applied over a image.

[[Image:UnderwaterEffectScreenshot.png|center|thumb|400px|Underwater effect]]

Below is a brief explanation of the underwater MFX file for better understand the idea behind MFX files.

[[Image:MFXSourceExplained.png|center|thumb|800px|MFX file source explained]]

==How to use a MFX file?==
All MFX files are located inside the 'effects' folder in Mewa Film installation directory. To use a new MFX file just copy your ''.mfx'' files to the folder ''effects'' in Mewa Film installation directory. An easy way to create your own MFX files is by modifying an existing MFX files (underwater.mfx and over.mfx).


MFX files contain GLSL code that needs to be compiled. The MFX file is compiled when added as node, from the [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Main_window#Nodes_toolbar|nodes tool bar]], to the node graph. If the MFX file does not compile it will become disabled from the nodes tool bar and the only way to enable it back is by restarting the application.

Remember that the MFX file is compiled on your graphics hardware, and so more elaborated MFX files might not work on older graphics hardware.


To help you create your own MFX files the ''MFX files info'' window was introduced.

[[Image:MFXFileInfoDialog.png|center|thumb|MFX file info dialog]]

To open the ''MFX Files Info'' window choose the menu ''Help &gt;&gt; MFX Files Info''. All the MFX files found inside ''effects'' folder are shown in the ''MFX file info'' list. To check your MFX file for any error, choose your MFX file from the shown list and press ''Refresh File''. The status column prints ''Success'' if the MFX file build without errors and is ready to be used, otherwise the error is printed.


Summarizing, you can edit the MFX file with your favourite text editor, save your changes, check if it compiles on the 'MFX files info' dialog, and once compiled verify its behaviour using it in the node graph.

==MFX file format overview==
A ''.mfx'' file starts with the element ''MewaFilmNode'' and has the following obligatory attributes:
*''Name''
*and ''Output''

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;MewaFilmNode Name=&quot;MyEffect&quot; Output=&quot;Image&quot;&gt;
  ...
&lt;/MewaFilmNode&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The ''Output'' element can be set to one of two options:
*Image
*Scene3D

Mewa Film [[Mewa Film User's Guide/Using the Node Graph|node graph]] has two kinds of nodes, image processing nodes and 3D scene nodes. The kind of node is defined by the node output. If the output of a node is an image then the node is a image processing node and will be added to the image processing tools, if the output is ''Scene3D'' the node is a 3D node and will be added to 3D tools.

Other optional attributes can be set to ''MewaFilmNode'' element, those are the output node tool tip, and a help address.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;MewaFilmNode Name=&quot;MyEffect&quot; Output=&quot;Image&quot; ToolTip=&quot;Magnific effect&quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Node inputs===
Node inputs are calculated by reading order of Sampler2DRect in the vertex shader. e.g. a vertex shader that starts with the following text,
&lt;pre&gt;
...
uniform sampler2DRect backImage;
uniform sampler2DRect frontImage;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
''backImage'' will be attached to TEXTURE0 and ''frontImage'' will be attached to TEXTURE1. These ''sampler2DRect'' are input nodes and added from left to right of the node. You can add ''sampler2DRect'' to a maximum of 6.

The PortTooltip is the tool tip shown when the mouse is over a node port.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Input Tooltip=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/Input&gt;
&lt;Input Tooltip=&quot;Input image&quot;&gt;&lt;/Input&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that doesnt matter what kind of inputs, ''Image'' and ''Scene3D'', tool tips are set by order of appearance.

===UI parameters===
Inside a ''MewaFilmNode'' element goes the GUI controls, to manipulate node's parameters, and the shaders source.

The UI controls are used to update shader's ''uniform'' variables. The GLSL data types that are available to use with UI controls are:
*float
*vec2
*vec3
*vec4
&lt;!--
* bool
* int
* bvec{2,3,4} bool vector
* ivec{2,3,4} vector of integers
--&gt;


The UISpinner is a spinner wheel control used to control values from &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The '''UISpinner''' has the following attributes,
*''Name'' defines the name
*''Step'' defines the step value for each tick, also know as precision
*''Default'' defines the default value


UISlider is a slider control, usefull to manipulate values inside a range. The '''UISlider''' has the following properties,
[[Image:SliderControl.png|right|thumb|Slider control]]
*''Name'' defines the name
*''Step'' defines the step value for each tick, also know as precision
*''Default'' defines the default value
*''Min'' defines the slider minimum value
*''Max'' defines the slider maximum value


''UIColor'' is a color selection widget where the user can choose a color using RGB sliders or from a color dialog. Colors are represented by 3 float values that can range between 0 and 1. The '''UIColor''' has the following properties,
[[Image:ColorControl.png|right|thumb|Color control]]
*''Name'' defines the name
*''DefaultRed'' default red color
*''DefaultGreen''
*''DefaultBlue''

The UIColor widget can be only be used to modify ''vec3'' or ''vec4'' GLSL data types.

If you want to use a ''vec4'' as a color,
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;UniformVariable Type=&quot;vec4&quot; Name=&quot;color&quot;&gt;
    &lt;UIColor Name=&quot;Background&quot;  DefaultRed=&quot;0.0&quot; DefaultGreen=&quot;0.0&quot; DefaultBlue=&quot;0.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/UIColor&gt;
    &lt;UISlider Step=&quot;0.01&quot; Name=&quot;Alpha&quot;  Min=&quot;0.0&quot; Max=&quot;1.0&quot; Default=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/UISlider&gt;
&lt;/UniformVariable&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


Parameters are inside tabs.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;Tab Title=&quot;Position&quot;&gt;
  &lt;UniformVariable Type=&quot;float&quot; Name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;
    &lt;UISpinner Step=&quot;0.01&quot; Name=&quot;Scale&quot; Default=&quot;0.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/UISpinner&gt;
  &lt;/UniformVariable&gt;
&lt;/Tab&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;



Because the ''vec4'' variable type contains 4 values we need 4 UI widgets to manipulate each of the value.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;UniformVariable Type=&quot;vec4&quot; Name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;
  &lt;UISlider Min=&quot;0.0&quot; Max=&quot;10.0&quot; Step=&quot;0.01&quot; Name=&quot;X&quot; Default=&quot;0.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/UISlider&gt;
  &lt;UISlider Min=&quot;0.0&quot; Max=&quot;10.0&quot; Step=&quot;0.01&quot; Name=&quot;Y&quot; Default=&quot;0.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/UISlider&gt;
  &lt;UISlider Min=&quot;0.0&quot; Max=&quot;10.0&quot; Step=&quot;0.01&quot; Name=&quot;Z&quot; Default=&quot;0.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/UISlider&gt;
  &lt;UISlider Min=&quot;0.0&quot; Max=&quot;10.0&quot; Step=&quot;0.01&quot; Name=&quot;A&quot; Default=&quot;0.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/UISlider&gt;
&lt;/UniformVariable&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can group all the UI widgets from a uniform variable inside a groupBox by adding the XML attribute ''UIName=&quot;GroupName&quot;'',
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;UniformVariable Type=&quot;vec4&quot; Name=&quot;test&quot; UIName=&quot;Test Variable&quot;&gt;
  ...
&lt;/UniformVariable&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Shader source===
The most important information in a MFX file is the GLSL source, it defines what the effect will do. The GLSL source is divided in two shaders, ''VertexShader'' and ''FragmentShader''.

The vertex shader source comes between ''&lt;VertexShader&gt;'' and ''&lt;VertexShader&gt;''. Below is a example of a vertex shader inside a MFX file.
&lt;pre&gt;
...
&lt;VertexShader&gt;
  uniform sampler2D displacementMap;
  void main(void)
  {
    gl_TexCoord[0] = gl_MultiTexCoord0;
    gl_Position = ftransform();
  }
&lt;/VertexShader&gt;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

The fragment shader is added to the MFX file in the same way, but comes between ''&lt;FragmentShader&gt;'' and ''&lt;/FragmentShader&gt;''.

The shader source needs to written in GLSL ES. For GLSL programmers this means that the ''precision'' keyword cannot be used.

==Examples==
To use the examples, open a text-only (plain text) editor. Usualy ''notepad'' on windows, ''vi'' or ''emacs'' on linux. Copy and paste the example to the opened file and save it with a name followed by ''.mfx''. Now just move the MFX file to ''&lt;MewaFilm_directory&gt;/effects''.

===Image processing node example===
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;MewaFilmNode Name=&quot;RedDivide&quot; Output=&quot;Image&quot; ToolTip=&quot;Simple effect&quot;&gt;

&lt;Input ToolTip=&quot;input image&quot;&gt;&lt;/Input&gt;

&lt;Tab Title=&quot;Position&quot;&gt;
  &lt;UniformVariable Type=&quot;float&quot; Name=&quot;split&quot;&gt;
    &lt;UISpinner Name=&quot;Scale&quot; Step=&quot;1.0&quot; Default=&quot;40.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/UISpinner&gt;
  &lt;/UniformVariable&gt;
&lt;/Tab&gt;


&lt;VertexShader&gt;
void main(void)
{
gl_TexCoord[0] = gl_MultiTexCoord0;
gl_Position = ftransform();
}
&lt;/VertexShader&gt;

&lt;FragmentShader&gt;
uniform sampler2DRect colorMap;
uniform float split;
						 
void main(void)
{
  vec4 sum = vec4(0.0);

  if(gl_TexCoord[0].s &amp;amp;lt; split)
  {
    sum = texture2DRect(colorMap, gl_TexCoord[0].st );
  }
  else
  {
    sum = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5);
  }

  gl_FragColor = sum;
}
&lt;/FragmentShader&gt;

&lt;/MewaFilmNode&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===3D node example===
The example below is a color effect.

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;MewaFilmNode Name=&quot;ColorsEffect&quot; Output=&quot;Scene3D&quot;&gt;

&lt;VertexShader&gt;
varying float xpos;
varying float ypos;
varying float zpos;
void main(void)
{
	gl_Position = ftransform();
	xpos = clamp(gl_Vertex.x,0.0,1.0);
	ypos = clamp(gl_Vertex.y,0.0,1.0);
	zpos = clamp(gl_Vertex.z,0.0,1.0);
}
&lt;/VertexShader&gt;

&lt;FragmentShader&gt;
varying float xpos;
varying float ypos;
varying float zpos;
void main (void)
{
	gl_FragColor = vec4 (xpos, ypos, zpos, 1.0);
}
&lt;/FragmentShader&gt;

&lt;/MewaFilmNode&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Considerations to take when writing MFX files==

===Texture coordinates===
Shders in MFX files must use ''Sampler2DRect'', not ''Sampler2D''. With ''Sampler2DRect'' you access image pixels using non-normalized coordinates, this means, pixels coordinates vary from 0 to image width and image height, e.g. to get the pixel 12,12 you do
&lt;pre&gt;
vec4 pixel = texture2DRect(image, vec2(12,12) );
&lt;/pre&gt;

The pixel at position (0,0) is at the bottom left corner of the image. The xx axis increases to the right side and the yy axis increases up.

===Image size in shaders===
It's possible to get information about the size of the input ''Sampler2DRect'' inside shaders. Just declare the uniform variable ''mfx_image&lt;Width|Height&gt;&lt;Sampler&gt;'', like shown below.
&lt;pre&gt;
uniform int mfx_imageWidth0;
uniform int mfx_imageHeight0;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The zero at the end of the variable name represents ''Sampler2DRect'' number. Sampler2DRect's are numbered by reading order, this means, the first declared ''Sampler2DRect'' is 0, the second is 1, and so on.

===XML reserved symbols===
Because .mfx files use xml syntax, the following symbols are &quot;reserved&quot; and may not be used in an instance document's data.

&lt;pre&gt;
     &lt;  &gt;  &amp;  &quot;  '
&lt;/pre&gt;

Instead, the &quot;escaped&quot; version, at the table below, must be used.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|+
! Symbol || &quot;escaped&quot; version
|-
| &amp;lt; || &amp;amp;lt;
|-
| &amp;gt; || &amp;amp;gt;
|-
| &amp;amp; || &amp;amp;amp;
|-
| &amp;quot; || &amp;amp;quot;
|-
| ' || &amp;amp;apos;
|}


However, you don't need to &quot;escape&quot; the symbols &gt;, &quot;, or ' you do need to escape &gt;, &quot;, and '.

===Audience===
Entry level nurses have a confusing variety of titles by state and country. Such nurses are sometimes called vocational, practical, enrolled or licensed (sometimes ''registered'' too). I have chosen to use the term '''vocational''' as a generic term to distinguish it from other health disciplines. This book may also be useful for allied workers in the health field, such as auxiliary,assistant or orderly. When starting out, it can be hard to find the right book and I am hoping this explanation helps.

This nursing textbook is intended to be ai introductory  reference for students training for occupational roles such as:-
* '''Australia and New Zealand'''  - Enrolled Nurse, Division two (Diploma, usually TAFE or equivalent RTO)
* '''Malaysia and Singapore''' Certificate Level Nursing.
* '''United Kingdom''' state enrolled nurse (level two, usually polytechnic) This level of training is no longer available in the UK
* '''United States''' Licensed Practical Nurse  (NCLEX-PN usually at a practical nurse school)
* '''South Africa''' Higher certificate or nursing auxiliary (new qualification commencing in 2012)

Vocational Nursing programs usually cover some of the content required for career progression to registered nursing by a university degree program. This book concentrates on outlines and brief theoretical coverage sufficient for application of the practical skills required for aged or disabled care, general practise and hospital nursing within the scope of vocational nursing practise. Vocational Nursing students are of a wide range of ages and educational background, from high school age to educational returnees making late career changes (for example after having children leave home). This book is concerned with referenced material in order to maintain currency, while bearing in mind that readers are predisposed toward using what the knowledge can '''do''' , rather than reading from generalist thoroughness. Be brief, use plain English and graphics wherever possible.

===Scope===
This book will not address [[Pharmacology]], [[General Anatomy]] or [[Human Physiology]]. These subjects are generously provided in other Wikibooks. See chapter on further reading.

The information planned for this book is of the type, depth and clarity already readily available on the Internet and in existing textbooks. Please observe copyright rules for wikibooks. This textbook proposes to condense, compile and simplify wherever possible. Pages should be fun, follow a narrative and use real life stories. The book has been divided in a rather ancient pattern, from head to toe. Dividing clients by organ system is quite false, but this organization is hoped to stimulate interest in a book long overdue for development. I hope readers concentrating on this book will spark  students and nurses to participate in writing about basic nursing first. They can then flex their skills in their own specialist field. I challenge all nurses to consider typing out a few pearls, to add their experience to this project. I challenge nursing trainers and lecturers in particular to engage their class in a topic review as a learning exercise and hand on the torch to succeeding generations.

Where a clearly articulated career pathway exists, many registered nurses became vocational nurses first. This is NOT a forum for debating merits of a tiered nursing  hierarchy. Doubts about the reality, need or utility of various grade of nurse should be addressed to governments on whom this responsibility rests. This book is intended for a cohort of health industry workers from around the world. This is a wiki-book where entry level nurses may come to feather the stumps of their ungrown wings. I hope all readers will join me in treating this is a book to welcome newcomers to nursing.

Registered Nurses and researchers will find a more academic nursing wikibook at [[Open Source Handbook of Nursing]]

==Purpose==
This book is intended to be a textbook for nurses studying the essentials of vocational nursing. The chapters have been arranged after Marjory Gordon's functional health patterns and named for the organ system chiefly concerned with each.  The future of other chapters is more flexible. The main drive of this book is to address the issues and topic of interest to nursing students undertaking tertiary programs leading to employment roles as trained nurses. The emphasis will be on the mechanics of caring for a generic adult clientèle within a defined regulated scope of nursing. Pages will carry detailed explanations of essential skills and knowledge required to function in the health care workplace. Variations on nursing skills and practise will be highlighted fro specialities in which nurses with mid-range education are employed, such as operating theatres, aged care and medical practise surgeries. The fundamentals of mental health, maternity, infant care will be addressed at an appropriate level for electives in novice nurse training.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The setting for [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] in in Oceania, a massive totalitarian state that is ruled by the possibly non-existant dictator &quot;Big Brother&quot;.  It includes Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, Polynesia, Southern Africa and the Americas.  Near the end of the novel Oceania is noted as conquering the whole of Africa.  There are two other countries listed in the book including: 
*Eurasia: which includes continental Europe and northern Asia.
*Eastasia: which includes China, Japan, Korea and Northern India. 

Most of the novel takes place in Oceania, where the protagonist Winston Smith lives.  Winston owns a flat in London, on the island of Air Strip One (formally Great Britan).

[[Nursing Study Guide]]

'''Nursing care of Clients with Nutritional Disorders'''so hopefully content will be easily accessible to students whether taking Fundamentals, or Med-Surge, or Pediatrics, or Maternal health.

Nutritional Standards to Promote Health include dietary recommendations, food guide pyramids for adequate nutrition. Nutritional assessment includes diet history, Anthropometric measurements (measurement of height and weight, assessment of body fat [body mass index]).
Obesity
Overweight means increased body weight for height compared to standard. Obesity is one of the most preventable health problems; it means at least 20% above upper limit of normal range for ideal body weight, due to excess adipose tissue. Obesity is adequately described by the amount of body fat. Morbid obesity has severe negative effects on health.
Complications of Obesity

Complications related to obesity include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), Obstructive sleep apnea, depression and other mental health/behavioral health problems, urinary incontinence, cholelithiasis, chronic back pain, early osteoarthritis, delayeded wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infection.

Pathophysiology of Obesity

Pathophysiology of obesity includes excess calories stored as fat, which can result from excess energy intake, deficient energy expenditure, or a combination of both. The appetite is controlled by the central nervous system (CNS) and by emotional factors. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of obesity include hormones (thyroid, insulin, leptin). Two types of  obesity are upper body (central) obesity with waist-hip ratio greater than 0.8, and lower body (peripheral) obesity.

Risk Factors of Obesity
Risk Factors for obesity include genetic, physiologic, physical activity, psychologic, environmental (fast foods, vending machines), sociocultural (family meals, rewards).

Obesity and Health Promotion

Include health promotion/illness prevention. Teach the potential consequences and complications. Teach the importance of eating a healthy diet, and that foods eaten away from home tend to be higher in fat, cholesterol, and salt, and lower in calcium. Reinforce need for regular moderate activity for at least 30 minutes per day, five or six days a week. Educate regarding diet and activity for children and adolescents, and continuing throughout adulthood.
Collaborative Care of Obesity
Collaborative Care includes diagnostics; BMI (20-2), anthropometry, underwater weighing, thyroid profile, serum glucose, lipid profile, cholesterol, ECG, treatment, and medications.
Nonsurgical Management of obesity may include fasting, very low-calorie diets of 400 to 800 calories per day, novelty diets, diet therapy, exercise programs, drug therapy, so hopefully content will be easily accessible to students whether taking Fundamentals, or Med-Surge, or Pediatrics, or Maternal health.OTC medications such as Meridia or Xenical, complementary and alternative therapies and treatments, behavioral therapy, food records which may help identify/eliminate cues that precipitate eating.
Surgical Management of Obesity may include liposuction, bariatric surgery, preoperative care, operative procedures, vertical banded gastroplasty, circumgastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.

Postoperative Care of Obesity includes analgesia, skin care, nasogastric tube placement, diet, prevention of postoperative complications. Observe for dumping syndrome signs such as tachycardia, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping.

Nursing Care of Obesity

Nursing Care includes health promotion. Start early. Nursing diagnosis (ND) and interventions include possibilities such as the following:

Imbalanced nutrition: more than body requirements; identify factors contributing to food excess, establish realistic goals, assess knowledge and provide patient teaching, discuss how patient can implement behavior modification.

Activity intolerance; assess current activity level, after medical clearance plan an individualized program.

Ineffective therapeutic regimen management; discuss ability to incorporate change, help identify behavior modification strategies, plan ways to deal with stress and interruptions in regimen.

Chronic low self-esteem; encourage patient to verbalize feelings, set small goals, refer to counseling if appropriate.

Home care of Obesity
Home care includes lifestyle changes; recruit the whole family, establish realistic goals with non food rewards, identify an exercise buddy, expect failures and learn to deal with them, use community resources.

Malnutrition
Malnutrition may result from inadequate intake of nutrients, or may be caused by inadequate nutrition intake, impaired absorption or increased metabolic need.

Pathophysiology of malnutrition
Pathophysiology of malnutrition includes starvation (inadequate dietary intake; as it continues the body breaks down fats into fatty acids and ketones), acute stress which produces a state of hypermetabolism and catabolism (cells and tissue breakdown; increased energy expenditure and nutrients needs) protein and calorie malnutrition (PCM): both proteins and calories are deficient.

Risk Factorsof malnutrition
Risk Factorsof malnutrition include age, poverty and homelessness, functional health problems, oral or GI problems affecting food intake, chronic pain or disease, medications or treatment, acute problems (infection, surgery, trauma).
Manifestations and Complications of malnutrition
Manifestations and Complications of malnutrition include weight loss, wasted appearance, dry and brittle hair, pale mucous membranes.

Collaborative Care of malnutrition

The goal of collaborative Care of malnutrition is torestore ideal body weight, to replace and restore depleted nutrients.
Laboratory Assessment of malnutrition includes BMI less than 20, hematology (iron, Hgb, protein studies, albumin below 3 mg/dl, serum cholesterol 160-200, other laboratory tests, total lymphocyte count reduced, serum electrolytes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Collaborative Care of malnutrition'''

Collaborative Care of malnutrition includes medications, fluid and dietary management, correct imbalances, enteral nutrition, parenteral nutrition.
Enteral Nutrition for malnutrition
There are different types of enteral products for nutrients, methods of administration of total enteral nutrition, and types of tubes (nasoenteric tube, enterostomal tube), types of feedings. Complications of total enteral nutrition include clogged tube, dislodgement, aspiration, fluid excess, increased osmolarity, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances.

Parenteral Nutrition for malnutrition
Parenteral Nutrition for malnutrition includes partial parenteral nutrition and total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Complications include fluid imbalances, electrolyte imbalances, glucose imbalances, and infection.

Nursing diagnoses and Interventions for malnutrition
Nursing diagnosis (ND) and interventions include possibilities such as the following:
Imbalanced Nutrition: less than body requirements; assess client, provide rest, assess knowledge and provide teaching.

Risk for infection; monitor for infection, maintain medical asepsis, teach signs of infection and hand washing techniques.

Risk for deficient fluid volume; monitor for dehydration, measure input and output, daily weight, allow frequent, preferred fluids.

Risk for impaired skin integrity; assess skin, turn every two hours, keep skin dry and clean.

==San Francisco Sourdough Bread==

Yield: 1 loaf

===Ingredients===
* 8 1/2 oz. (225 ml) water, warm (120ºF/49ºC)
* 1/2 oz. (15 g) active dry yeast
* 1 cup (225 ml) sourdough starter (recipe follows)
* 1 lb. (450 g) flour
* 1 Tbs. (15 ml) salt
* 1 egg white, beaten

'''For the Sourdough Starter:'''
* 1 lb. (450 g) grapes, stemmed
* 12 oz. (340 g) bread flour
* water, as needed

===Preparation===
# In a glass measuring cup, sprinkle the dry yeast onto the surface of 4 tablespoons of the warm water and allow to stand until it becomes foamy.
# In a bowl, combine the rest of the water with the sourdough starter.
# Add 1 cup of the flour.
# Stir until the dough starts to form and then add the yeast mixture.
# Mix for 5 minutes.
# Add the remaining flour and the salt.
# Knead the dough until it is soft and elastic, 10 minutes or more.
# Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Let rise in a warm place (ca. 80ºF/27ºC to 90ºF/32ºC) until doubled.
# Punch down the dough and shape it into a round loaf. Place the loaf on a greased and corn-meal dusted sheet pan.
# Let the loaf rise in a warm place, covered with a damp cloth, until it has doubled in size.
Brush the loaf with beaten egg white and score the top of the loaf in a criss-cross pattern with a sharp knife.
# Bake at 450ºF (230ºC) with a pan of boiling water under the oven rack for 10 minutes.
# Reduce the oven temperature to 375ºF (190ºC), remove the water and continue baking until the bread is well browned, ca. 35 - 45 minutes.
# Cool on a rack.

=Sourdough starter=
[[File:Mother-culture.png|right|thumb|Starter]]

# Mash the grapes thoroughly and place in a loosely-covered container. Allow to stand at room temperature for 48 hours.
# Strain off the fermented juice and discard the pulp.
# Add warm water to the juice to make 1 pint (450 ml)
# Stir in the flour and leave at room temperature overnight.
# Replenish with 1 pint of warm water and 2 cups of flour daily if the starter is kept at room temperature. If refrigerated, replenish twice a week.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How Students in Accelerated Programs Can Succeed in Fundamentals of Nursing

The classes in an accelerated program are unique; it takes some adjustment and adaptation. We signed up for this style for a variety of reasons, but behind each one was the desire to reap the benefits. Below are some suggestions for effectively implementing accelerated learning when taking Fundamentals of Nursing, toward the goal of maximizing this learning experience.

Start with the basics; get a good night’s sleep every night; have a good breakfast each morning before class; arrive early and refreshed so you can start your day with a clear mind; attend all scheduled classes and clinicals; be prepared; read the text and know the schedule so you can study and do your assignments as early reasonably possible. Don’t take on any new unnecessary tasks; this is not the time to start a new diet and exercise program or look for new dating relationships. This is the time to streamline the other areas of your life and focus on your studies.

Don’t just attend class, but attend to class. Pay attention; write down as much as you can of what the professors say. Sometimes what seem at first like offhand comments or humor turn out to enhance understanding of important points. Those very remarks may even help you answer test questions.&lt;br&gt;

Let your body language communicate attentiveness and respect. If your posture and demeanor look like you’re paying attention, there is a strong likelihood your mind will follow suit and you will retain more of what is presented.

Collectively study if possible; others may have their own ways to group ideas, or they may see how the concepts fit together in ways that you might not see at first. As you’re learning, glean from one another’s strengths. Take turns explaining the material you just heard to another student, and have them explain it to you. Compare your notes with other students’ notes. Sometimes others will pick up on points you missed or vice versa; collective notes will be more comprehensive than individual notes.

Record lectures, and listen to them repeatedly. Lay out your notes along with your textbook, and review them while reviewing your sound recording. Fill in any missing details. Pause the sound and read more thoroughly anything that seems unclear, then go back over it. Make note cards to carry with you. Write down any questions you have and ask your professor as soon as you identify areas of uncertainty; if one professor’s answer still leaves you unclear, ask another. Don’t save the questions for the morning before the test.

If provided a login for any online resources, go to the website as soon as possible, and utilize the materials there. Online resources may include audio and video instructional material, practice questions and practice tests. Watch, listen, practice as much as time allows. It will help you understand the material. Download any audio files to your mp3 player, and listen to them ad nauseum along with your own sound recordings of lectures. The more you expose your mind to the material, the more you will understand, apply, and remember.

The questions you can expect now and in upcoming classes will involve application and critical thinking; the days of cramming and regurgitation facts is over. You will still need the raw facts, but you will also need to know how to prioritize, how to select the best of several correct answers, and to identify information that may be only slightly incorrect or slightly misapplied.

Answer any questions the textbook offers, any the study guide offers, any the CD offers, any your online resources offer. Acquire another textbook from another publisher; online bookstores carry scores of used textbooks, many of which cost only a few dollars; buy some and answer any practice questions they contain. Go back over your collection of questions and answers until you consistently get them right. Create your own questions and go over those as well.

Utilize snatches of time throughout your daily activities to review material; for example, carry note cards to review while stuck in traffic, and have audio and video lectures playing in the background while folding laundry or preparing meals.

Learn from your mistakes; during test review, note any areas you need a better understanding. Go back over these areas after each test. Note any critique the professors provide, whether in clinicals or on assignments or any other areas, and implement the changes they suggest. Correct those areas and excel.

Stay ahead of your assignments; any papers that are assigned should be done as early as you are able. If you have your work done ahead of schedule, ask your professor if she would be willing to give you feedback so you can make any corrections or improvements well in advance. The earlier you ask, the more likely you are to be given suggestions so you can present your best work for a grade.

If certain facts are repeated throughout several assignments, for example the purpose of lab values, type the basic ones out early. The purpose and meaning behind values represented in routine urinalysis, complete blood count, and basic metabolic profile will come in handy time and time again. Save your work, and make backup copies so you will have it ready to copy and paste when you need it. Then the time you save instead of re-typing the same information, can be put toward selecting the wording for other parts of an assignment.

Plan to study and work on assignments as many hours as your schedule allows, but do set a limit; do not cut into your sleep to put in extra time studying. Sleep deprivation tends to create confusion. You need a clear mind to do your best on the tests and to provide the care for your patients when you start clinicals.

Establish a firm foundation so your performance will reflect the sum of your of time, strengths, and efforts throughout the next chapters, for your upcoming classes, for NCLEX, and for your career.

'''''Pain au levain naturel – Pain levain'''''          '''Wild Yeast Bread'''
 
==Ingredients==

* bread flour or all-purpose flour, organic, unbleached as needed (N.B. see note)
* distilled or bottled water, as needed

==Procedure==
[[Image:Mother-culture.png|right|thumb|Culture]]
===The Culture===
Three or four days in advance:

#Mix 150 g (½ cup) of flour with a little warm water (non-chlorinated) to obtain a dough not too wet and not too dry. 
#Allow to stand 3 or 4 days in a covered glass or earthenware  at a temperature above 20ºC (68ºF). 
#Stir the dough daily with a wooden spoon and add a little warm water and a little flour.

===The Bread ===

Yield: 4 loaves

The evening before (prep. Time 10 min.):

#Add about 500 g (1 pound)  flour and 300 g (1 cup) water to the yeast culture
#Work the dough for 5 to 10 min. with a wooden spatula.      
#Cover with a clean cloth and allow to stand at a temperature of about 25ºC (77ºF).
    

The next morning:
  
#If the dough has not risen sufficiently, let stand another 12 hours. When it is ready, save about 3 tablespoons of the dough in the refrigerator as a starter for the next time you make ''pain levain''.      
#Add to the dough: about 1.6 kg   (10 cups) flour, 800 g (3¼ cups) water, 20 g (2 tsp.) coarse salt (or 1½ tsp table salt)        
#Mix well in a bowl. Don’t incorporate all of the flour. Save some to knead the dough.      
#When the dough becomes difficult to manipulate in the bowl, work it on a flat surface, adding a little flour as necessary. Knead the dough well for about 20 minutes by pulling and folding but without pressing down on it.
#Cover with a clean cloth and leave to proof for an hour at around 25ºC (77ºF).     
#Divide the dough into 3 balls.      
#Oil three pans and insert the balls of dough after shaping them to the size of the pan. They may also be baked without a pan in which case set them on a baking sheet.      
#At each rising stage, cover with a clean cloth.      
#Allow to rise for 2 hours or more at around 25ºC (77ºF) until the loaves have risen to 1½ to double their size.     
#When the loaves have risen, cut diagonal incisions along the length of the loaves with a razor blade.     
#Preheat the oven and bake at 260ºC (500ºF) for ½ an hour. Lower the heat to 200ºC (400ºF) and bake for another ¼ to ½ an hour. 
#In an oven with uneven heat distribution it may be necessary to move the loaves around halfway through baking.      
#Two thirds of the way through baking, sprinkle the loaves with cold water and continue baking. This will give a shiny surface.

==Notes==
*It is essential to use organic flour.  Insecticides and bleaching can kill the natural yeasts in flour.
**Dissenting opinion: I have had success using flour from conventionally-farmed grain. The bacteria and yeasts used to make sourdough are present everywhere. If it is the case that conventional flour does not have enough yeast/lactobacilli to leaven bread, then these microorganisms certainly find the starter one way or another.

*The bread will keep for one week. 

*Suitable French flour types: complete 110 (high gluten bread flour) or half-complete type 80 (all-purpose).

==About ''Pain levain''==

This is a simplified recipe. The traditional method of making ''pain levain'' is a long seven stage process. It begins with the starter saved from a previous batch of bread being set aside for 8 hours until it has developed an alcoholic odour. This is called the '''''levain de chef''''''' (head-leaven). This is then mixed with flour and water and allowed to ferment another six hours.  At this stage it is known as '''''levain de première''''' (first leaven). It is mixed with more flour and water and becomes '''''levain de seconde''''' (second leaven). It ferments again until it has risen.  Another batch of flour and water is added. This is known as '''''levain de tous points''''' (leaven of all stages). Half of this is made into loaves, proofed and baked and yields rather dark and sour loaves. The other half is mixed with more flour and water and allowed to rise. It is again divided in two and half is baked providing a medium quality of bread. More flour and water is added to the remaining dough and it rises again. This is the final batch and it yields the whitest bread with the best flavour.

The puzzling complexity of this procedure is not difficult to explain. Wild yeast is a very unpredictable commodity whose properties cannot be easily controlled. It depends on the strain of yeast of which there are several in any environment at one time, as well as the temperature of the environment, moisture content of the dough, and the ingredients themselves. Successive dilution of the culture in this way effects a measure of control of the uncontrollable, yielding a choice of breads using different quantities of leaven.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;The Basics&lt;/big&gt;'''

I am originally from South Park, PA, outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I moved to Virginia Beach a few years ago, and now am finally in Norfolk, Virginia attending Old Dominion University. I would love to someday move back to Pennsylvania or Maryland because I love the seasons and seeing the trees' leaves turn orange. There aren't enough trees in Norfolk, though. 

&lt;big&gt;'''Education Background'''&lt;/big&gt;

I am at Old Dominion University for Music Education with an Instrumental Concentration. 

&lt;big&gt;'''The Future'''&lt;/big&gt;

I plan to continue with my educational degree at a different accredited university. After getting my Masters, I will either begin a music studio where I will teach local students and perform in varies musical groups, or become a college professor at an accredited university (Steubenville! here I come).

'''&lt;big&gt;My Educational Philosophy&lt;/big&gt;'''

I believe teachers should understand/become experts in their fields so that they can exemplify to their students what knowledge the students should attempt to strive for, while doing it in a very efficient but fun way. Secondly, I hope teachers would aid students with information not only listed in textbooks, but with interesting facts/stories that will grab their attention from bell ring to bell ring.

&lt;big&gt;'''Hobbies and Interests'''&lt;/big&gt;



I am currently the first Drum Major of the Old Dominion University Marching Monarchs. Under the direction of Mrs. Patti Carlson, the principal Clarinet player of the Virginia Symphony, I play Bb Clarinet. I play in varies local music groups including the Professional Tidewater Winds Concert Band, the ODU Wind Ensemble, and the ODU Pepband. I have been a guest performer with the VA Youth Symphony and the United States Atlantic Fleet Band. I have been accepted as a lead mellophone player with the Crossmen, a Drum Corps. International Texas group, in 2008, and Carolina Crown, another DCI group, in 2006; and also, a music camp counselor at the Blue Lakes Fine Arts Camp in Michigan, in the summer of 2008. 

Simply, I love music and learning many instruments. My favorite quote is: &quot;Play the music, not the instrument.&quot;-anonymous</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The answer to the problem at the very bottom is -3.08=z

-5 / -3 = 9 + 2.4z - 9
1.6 - 9 = 9 + 2.4z - 9
-7.4 / 2.4 = 2.4z / 2.4
-3.08 = z

sorry, actually the answer is correct but formula is this = [-5 / -3 = 9 + 2.4z - 9], [1.6 - 9 = 9 + 2.4z - 9], [-7.4 / 2.4 = 2.4z / 2.4], [-3.08 = z], i closed each part in so you can see it.



[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28+%28+z-5+%29+%2F+3+%29+%3D+9+%2B+%283.4z%29 Wolfram Alpha] gives a different answer (z=-3.47826) than either the above or the original page.
Hmm... yet when I paste the original in as written ([http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%5Bz+-+5%5D+%2F+-3%29+%3D+9+%2B+3.4z here]), I get approximately the same answer as on the original page (z=-1.96429)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About the Author ==

=== The Basics ===
Hi!  My name is Daisy and I was born in the Philippines, but I moved and was assimilated into American culture at a very young age.  Don't bother asking me to speak Tagalog, because I only remember ''very'' few words.  We moved to Virginia when I was eight... I think, and we've lived in the same house ever since.

=== Education Background ===
Locally, I spent a year at Granby High before transferring over to Norview.  I graduated from that amazing place in 2005, and enrolled at ODU with accounting as my declared major.  After last spring, I (finally) made the switch over to English with emphasis in Education.  It was a big change, and I have a lot of catching up to do, but it was - and still is - ''&lt;u&gt;well&lt;/u&gt;'' worth it.

=== The Future ===
After getting my Bachelor's, I plan on teaching in Norfolk Public Schools, preferably Norview High School, for a few years.  That's where I met some of the best teachers I've ever come across, and I'd like to return the favor.  I've always wanted to live in a more rural area, probably somewhere up in the mountains near Charlottesville.  I've also been thinking about getting my Masters in English at UVA, if I don't get it while I'm still in Norfolk.

=== Hobbies &amp; Interests ===
First and foremost, let me go ahead and point out that I am a '''big''' Star Wars fan!!  With that out of the way, I enjoy reading, writing, drawing, and photography.  My favorite genre is probably science fiction or fantasy, but I love a good old literary novel every now and then - especially everything and anything by Jane Austin.  Outside of the artsy stuff, I like to work on my car and watch the military planes fly over my house.  I enjoy having fun &amp; going out shopping.  I firmly believe that shopping is a necessity in life and is the ultimate cure-all... next to ice cream, of course.


== Educational Philosophy ==
I haven't thought much about my own educational philosophy before, but right now I would have to say that I'd have to follow the lead of the teachers that have inspired me throughout my educational career to become a teacher.  I believe there is a difference between a good teacher and a great teacher.  A good teacher gets the course content across to the students, assigns homework and tests that reflect the material taught, and generally gets the job done with out much trouble.  A great teacher, however, gets students involved in the classroom, helping them excel in their work, and changing a teaching method to better suit the students.  Great teachers go beyond the normal job description and become a role model, and maybe even a mentor.  They inspire students to reach for their goals, and to work hard to reach their dreams.

This doesn't apply to just &quot;normal&quot; kids, but to all students from all walks of life - including those with special needs.  A passionate teacher is one that cares enough about educating the future that differences such as a disorder or physical impairment will not stand in the way of offering everyone equal education.  All students should be able to learn and interact with one another in the same classroom, and the school system should do its part in making sure that no student is hindered from learning just because of a disorder or impairment.  Everyone should have an equal opportunity to learn, and everyone deserves a classroom setting that stimulates their mind, motivates them to succeed, and genuinely leave school enjoying the experience.

I can honestly say that, because of the teachers I was fortunate enough to have during my three years at Norview, I was able to experience and witness all that I have mentioned above.  I thoroughly enjoyed my classes, because of the teachers that put in so much time and effort to make the courses interesting and interactive.  I can only hope to continue the teaching methods and philosophies they have bestowed on me by becoming a teacher and (hopefully) positively affecting future generations.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Major and Such''' ==



I am a sophomore at Old Dominion University majoring in English with a focus in education. I want to to high school English. I have a real passion for it and after having such amazing English teachers in high school I was convinced it was for me. I am from Midlothian VA and went to Maggie Walker for High School, it was a great time. Midlothian is really part of Richmond, it is the more suburban southern portion. 


== '''Now''' ==


Write now I enjoy being an undergraduate. I am not sure if I want to get my Masters at ODU or not. I may head home and get it at VCU. Right now I am focusing on really expanding my English skills by writing and reading as much as I can.


== '''Hobbies''' ==


I actually write a lot. I specialize in poetry. I think I am published in a few things here and there and have done fairly well in the contests I have entered. Since writing as a career is shaky I want to teach to have some steady income. I am trying to learn the guitar with little success so far. I also play a lot of video games, love the Wii, and play a lot of card games.

== '''Teaching Philosophy''' ==


This seems sort of vague to me. I have believe that teaching is about more than just testing. It is about showing a subject to your students in a new and refreshing way that makes them want to learn and see the use in learning. Today people get payed insane amounts of money for things that require no education, such as sports. Teaching is showing students what academics has to offer and if they can't be convinced, then helping them to open their minds and think for themselves.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to use eXist to manage your web site and use each collection as a web-content folder.  You want a way to automatically create a sitemap for the site so that as you add a new collection in your web root folder the site navigation menus will automatically be updated.

== Method ==

We will use the eXist '''get-child-collections()''' function to get all of the child collections for a root collection.  We create a recursive function that traverses the collection tree.

From the eXist function library, here is the description of get-child-collections function.

&lt;pre&gt;
xmldb:get-child-collections($a as xs:string) xs:string*

Returns a sequence of strings containing all the child collections of the collection specified in $a.
The collection parameter can either be a simple collection path or an XMLDB URI.
&lt;/pre&gt;

If we have a collection called '''/db/webroot''' we could pass this string as a parameter to this function and all the child collections would be returned as sequence of strings.

We can then create a recursive function that works on each of these child collections.

== Sample use of get-child-collections() ==

Here is a very simple use of the function get-child-collections().  You just pass it a single argument which is a path to a collection.  It will return a sequence of all the child collections in that collection.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $children := xmldb:get-child-collections('/db/webroot')

return
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;children&gt;{$children}&lt;/children&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

== Sitemap Function: Version 1 ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:sitemap($collection as xs:string) as node()* {
   if (empty(xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)))
      then ()
      else
         &lt;ol&gt;{
            for $child in xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)
            return
               &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;{concat('/exist/rest', $collection, '/', $child)}&quot;&gt;{$child}&lt;/a&gt;
                  {local:sitemap(concat($collection, '/', $child))}
               &lt;/li&gt;
        }&lt;/ol&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

This recursive function takes a single input argument of a string and returns a complex node.  The result is an HTML ordered list structure.  It first does a test to see if there are any children elements in the collection.  If there are not any, it just returns. If there are new children elements, then it creates a new ordered list and iterates through all the child elements in that collection creating a new list item for each child and then calling itself.  Note that this could have been written so that the conditional operator only calls itself if there are child elements in a collection.

This is an example of [[w:Tail recursion|tail recursion]].  This pattern occurs frequently in XQuery functions.

== Sample Sitemap Program ==
We can now call this program within an XHTML page template to create a web page:

== Source Code ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html indent=yes&quot;;

declare function local:sitemap($collection as xs:string) as node()* {
   if (empty(xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)))
      then ()
      else
         &lt;ol&gt;{
            for $child in xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)
            return
               &lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;a href=&quot;{concat('/exist/rest', $collection, '/', $child)}&quot;&gt;{$child}&lt;/a&gt;
                  {local:sitemap(concat($collection, '/', $child))}
               &lt;/li&gt;
        }&lt;/ol&gt;
};

&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Sitemap&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Sitemap for collection /db/webroot&lt;/h1&gt;
      {local:sitemap('/db/webroot')}
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Adding Titles ==
Sometimes the title for the navigation bar will be different from the name of the collection.  By convention collection names usually are just short lowercase letters without spaces or uppercase letters.  Navigation bars typically have labels that contain spaces and uppercase letters.

Here is an example that uses a lookup table to look up the title from a an XML file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare function local:sitemap($collection as xs:string) as node()* {
if (empty(xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)))
  then ()
  else
   &lt;ol&gt;{
      for $child in xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)
      let $db-path := concat($collection, '/', $child)
      let $path := concat('/exist/rest', $collection, '/', $child)
      let $lookup :=
doc('/db/apps/sitemap/06-collection-titles.xml')/code-table/item[$db-path=path]/title/text()
      order by $child
      return
         &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href=&quot;{if (empty($lookup))
                      then ($path)
                      else (concat($path, &quot;/index.xhtml&quot;))}&quot;&gt;
                      {if (empty($lookup)) then ($child) else ($lookup)}
            &lt;/a&gt;
           {local:sitemap(concat($collection, '/', $child))}
         &lt;/li&gt;
   }&lt;/ol&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Screen Image ==
[[Image:XQuery-sitemap-screen-image.jpg|frame|center]]

Note that the child collections are all sorted alphabetically.  In some cases this may not be the order you would like to display your site navigation menus.  You can add an element a sort-order parameter to the XML file that displays the titles and use that field to sort the child collections.

== Collection Titles file ==

Put this file in the following location: '''/db/apps/sitemap/06-collection-titles.xml'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;code-table&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/about&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;About&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/training&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Training&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/faqs&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/training/xforms&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;XForms&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/training/rest&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;ReST&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/training/xquery&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;XQuery&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/training/tei&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Text Encoding Initiative&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/training/exist&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;eXist&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/products&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Products&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;path&gt;/db/webroot/support&lt;/path&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Support&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/code-table&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Customizing Your Sitemap Function ==
Not all collections should be displayed in a sitemap.  Some collections may contain private administrative data that you do not want to display in a public sitemap.  There are two ways to handle this.  You can keep a general &quot;published collections&quot; list in a separate XML file.  Alternatively you can store a small XML file in each collection that displays the properties of that collection .  By default this collection may be either public or private, depending on how you write your function. 

The second option is more portable if you and your associates are each building web applications you would like to share.  By standardizing on your collection-properties.xml files you can store properties in a collection and then exchange them with other eXist sites by just exchanging the collections as folders that can be zipped.

== Counting Files In Collection and SubCollections ==
Here is the psudo code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function local:count-files-in-collection($collection as xs:string) as xs:integer {
let $child-collections := xmldb:get-child-collections($collection)
   if (empty($child-collections))
      then
         (: return the count of number of files in this collection :)
      else 
         (: for each subcollection call local:count-files-in-collection($child) :)
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Introduction ==
Hi!  My name is '''Peter Drake''', of course that isn't my real name, just my pen name.  But I like it.  I am interested in Sci-fi and Science, so I will probably be writing or editing books in that category.  I have accounts on all the Wikimedia websites, but I don't have Userpages on all of them.  I have a Userpage on Wikipedia, here is the link:
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Peter_Drake My Wikipedia Userpage]

This Wikibook is dedicated to the teaching of the '''Punjabi''' language. 

== Book Objectives ==
This Wikibook is meant to be an introductory course for 
the non-native learner of Punjabi language having working knowledge of English language. 
It seeks to introduce to the non-native learner of Punjabi language 
the [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi]] and [[Punjabi/Shahmukhi|Shahmukhi]] scripts, 
preliminary vocabulary, Language learning and some preliminary Punjabi grammar. 
On completion of the course the learner should be able to read Punjabi paragraphs 
and make simple sentences and small paragraphs.

== Book Organization ==
This Wikibook is divided into modules. Here is brief description of the modules:

== Writing System : Gurmukhi ==
This is a basic module and must be learnt 
thoroughly before you can expect to understand any further modules or lessons. 
This module consists of eleven lessons. The first ten of these are devoted to 
introducing the alphabets of the Gurmukhi script and the matras which represent the vowels of Punjabi and the diacritics which are some special symbols. 
We have delibrately avoided including the 
punctuation marks and the numerals as they are almost the same as the English ones. 
The teaching of the script has been made language independent. 
As a consequence you need not have any previous knowledge or experience of Punjabi to 
learn these lessons. Care has been been taken to introduce the alphabets in a logical 
way and with minimal use letters which are not introduced uptil that lesson. 
You are expected to go through a lot of practising of the illustrative 
examples used in the text of the lessons.

== Writing System : Shahmukhi ==
This is an alternative writing system used mainly in Pakistan. 
You are required to learn only one writing system unless you yourself decide to learn both. 

== Muharni ==
This module is specially designed to make you comfortable with Punjabi speech. 
Muharni literally means a speaking practice excercise. You can play the sound files and follow speaking the words of Muharni.

You can also visit www.muharni.com to learn what each characters look like as well how sound is made by placing your mouse over each muharni characters.

== Vocabulary ==
This module conatins about 500 words and seeks 
to teach you selected Punjabi vocabulary in common use. 
The purpose of this lesson is to equip you to undertake reading exercises with ease. 
Some preliminary grammar concepts like number, gender etc. 
will be taught with the help of these words.
Before you can hope to learn these lessons you must be thorough with the Gurmukhi script.

== Conversation ==
This module is the most important module and intends to equip 
you with the skill of using Punjabi language as an effective means of communication. 
A very important feature of this module, when it is complete, will be its 
complete lack of dependence on a formal knowledge of vigorous rules of grammar. 
However an attempt has been made to make you aware of the rules of grammar by their 
actual usage in common conversation. 
The exercises have been based on the situations that you face in your day to day life. 
This serves the twin purpose of making you proficient in communication as also to 
make the learning process both easy and interesting. 

== Phonetics ==
This is a special Appendix for those who wish to use their knowledge of Phonetics in leaning the Punjabi phonology. 

== Grammar ==
This module is an advanced topic and is not required to be formally learnt. 
Its best use lies in frequent references by the learner. 
However once you have mastered other modules and you are prepared to 
put in some more effort, a thorough learning of this module will most likely help 
you have a deeper understanding of the language.

== Dictionary of Punjabi Usage ==
This module provides you a handy dictionary and a large number of examples of the correct usage of these words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Wikipedia, Wikibooks, WikiAnything are resources (currently) freely available to all.
We will discuss these under the rubric of the Semantic Web precisely because WikiAnything is amenable to processing by machine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">So! It seems to me that all things Wiki have an extremely important role to play
in Computers &amp; Society. I already use Wikipedia as a core teaching resource in the
university and I expect this Wikibook to become a core text also.

Looking to the (near) future, say 2012, I expect the Semantic Web to be a teenager
where the machine really will get on with it (on their own).

So, the WikiWorld  goes here!

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;3300CC&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;My name is Megan Heath and I have lived in Suffolk, Virginia for all 18.5 years of my life. Suffolk gets a reputation of being all country roads and farms, probably because it's home to Planter's Peanuts, but really it isn't anything like that.  Northern Suffolk, where I'm from, is a developing urban part of Hampton Roads and I love having the country feel, yet still being close to the city.  I grew up with my father being active duty Navy, yet somehow managed to stay in one house my entire life. I have two sisters, one older, age 21, and one younger, age 12, so being the middle daughter out of three girls has been an experience, to say the least.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#4B0082&quot; face=&quot;AD LIB BT&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; Hobbies&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;3300CC&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Considering I am a full time college student and part time employee at Perry Library, I rarely get much free time anymore.  When I do get a moment to myself, I usually spend it listening to music, going to concerts, drawing, taking pictures, or just relaxing with my friends.  I'm just an average teenager with a busy schedule.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #9966FF;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;3300CC&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;I've always been the kind of person who loves helping others and who wanted to make a difference in someone's life.  Helping raise my younger sister, as well as babysitting and taking care of young children has made me realize how the field of education is the perfect career for me.  I really enjoying teaching children things and watching their minds develop as they grow.  I want to be the kind of kindergarten teacher, whose students still remember me when they are graduating highschool.  I want to make a difference in the way children learn and view their educational careers; I figure Kindergarten is a wonderful place to create the foundation for the rest of their future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;90%&quot; ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #9966FF;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;3300CC&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;I believe to be a successful teacher, you have to be willing to step outside the box. Paper and pencil, lecture teaching just does not work for the children of today. I think teachers should enter their classroom with enthusiasm and a positive energy; otherwise, their students will feel negative attitudes and therefore, not have as successful a learning experience as they could have had.  I believe it is important for educators to be able to assess each student's needs and teach them based on those needs. All children learn differently, and therefore, teachers must be able to cater to each students learning style; whether they learn visually, by listening or kinesthetically.  I believe in inclusive classrooms as well as conducting cooperative learning where students work in groups to achieve a goal.  Because, I plan to teach younger children (PK-3), it is even more vital to keep them engaged and alert to what they are learning.  I believe educators should incorporate technology into their classroom; WebQuests, videos, and interactive games are just a few ways in which teachers can do this.  Not only should a teacher be able to administer information to the students, but she should also mold their minds and help them to make better choices with their lives.  Conducting a classroom where students as well as the teacher show respect to everyone and there is not judgment or bullying is key to a successful classroom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;</text>

Megan,

I completely agree with your teaching philosophy! I feel that teachers should all be the constant positive source for all of their students. I think it allows for a warm classroom that may encourage your students to feel comfortable to ask questions about their learning. I do agree that being that positive and enthusiastic energy in your classroom with facilitate learning and excitement, especially for the little guys! [[User:Abake028|Abake028]] ([[User talk:Abake028|talk]]) 14:46, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

Megan - 

I support your statements.  Teachers need to think outside the box.  They also need to differentiate their instruction and not just rely on lecture and notes.  It is important to have activities that engage the students.  Students who are engaged in an activity are far more likely to learn and comprehend the material.  A classroom enviroment that is positive, warm, engaging, and interactive is an enviroment where learning takes place.

Megan,

I was an assistant at a Montesorri school for about a year, and I applaud you for wanting to take on the 5 yr old crowd.  They're tough!  Your hope to be a remembered teacher makes me smile, because the school I worked for was the same one I went to as a girl.  Yes, I had stayed in touch with my wonderful kindergarten teacher for over 20 years!!  I totally agree with your teaching philosophy.  I, too, feel that a teacher needs to be eager and excited and the kids will follow suite.  And kudos on wanting to bring the classroom into the 21st century.  Technology is taking over the world and our little ones need to learn early.
[[User:Rwebe005|Rwebe005]] ([[User talk:Rwebe005|talk]]) 00:16, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

Megan,

I have already took ECI 304 where we do Webquests and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! I think they will engage not only little kids but older too!! It is sooo important for children to have an enthusiastic teacher. It will make them excited to learn! The little ones really need the positivity. [[User:Cwill122|Cwill122]] ([[User talk:Cwill122|talk]]) 21:44, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

Megan,

Last summer I worked as a teacher's aide teaching summer school at my old elementary school and when they told me I was going to be with kindergartners I was a little scared at first but then I thought, well, maybe it will be a good experience.  I absolutely LOVED it.  Being so young they are so open minded and (most of them) love to learn things.  It takes a special kind of person to teach Kindergarten.  I wish you luck :).
[[User:Abake023|Abake023]] ([[User talk:Abake023|talk]]) 23:59, 12 September 2008 (UTC)


Hey Megan!

Thanks for commenting on my page! I think its awesome that you want to be a kindergarten teacher.  I like how opened minded you are about teaching, and using more than just the traditional ways of old. We definitely share very similar views with our teaching philosophies.  I feel that if we're excited as teachers, then maybe, just maybe, a little will rub off onto the children that we teach.  Good luck in the future!

== Formatting ==

It's good that you know HTML, and as you've probably noticed it works pretty well here at Wikibooks. However, we also have some shortcuts that you can use to accomplish some of the same common tasks with fewer keystrokes. Two apostrophes on either side ''makes things italics''. Three apostrophies on each side '''makes things bold'''. Click the [edit] link here to see the source code so you can see that it works. 

We've been trying to take all these little pearls of wisdom and put them into a helpful book for new users: [[Using Wikibooks]]. If you have any questions about anything, feel free to leave me a message [[User talk:Whiteknight|on my user talk page]].

[[Image:Cognac glass.jpg|thumb|Brandy]]
'''Brandy''' (from brandywine, derived from Dutch brandewijn — “burnt wine”)  is a spirit produced by distilling wine, the wine having first been produced by fermenting grapes. Brandy contains 40%–60% alcohol by volume and is normally consumed as an after-dinner drink. While some brandies are aged in wooden casks, most are coloured with caramel colouring to imitate the effect of such aging.

Brandy can also be made from fermented fruit (i.e., other than grapes) and from pomace, the must left over from wine making.

==Types of brandy==

===Grape brandy===

Grape brandy is produced by the distillation of fermented grapes.
*American grape brandy is almost always from California.[2] Popular brands include Christian Brothers, Coronet, E&amp;J, Korbel, and Paul Masson.
*Armagnac is made from grapes of the Armagnac region in Southwest of France (Gers, Landes, Lot-et-Garonne). It is single-continuous distilled in a copper still and aged in oak casks from Gascony or Limousin. Armagnac was the first distilled spirit in France. Armagnacs have a specificity: they offer vintage qualities. Popular brands are Darroze, Baron de Sigognac, Larressingle, Delord, Laubade, Gélas and Janneau.
*Brandy de Jerez is the brandy from the area of Jerez. As such it is an essential ingredient to Sherry, but it is also available separately. Like Sherry and Cognac it is a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). The traditional production method has three characteristics: (1) Aged in American oak-wood casks with a capacity of 500 litres, previously having contained Sherry Wine. (2) The sue of the traditional ageing system of Criaderas and Soleras. (3) Aged exclusively within the municipal boundaries of Jerez de la Frontera, El Puerto de Santa María and Sanlúcar de Barrameda, in the province of Cádiz. 
*Cognac comes from the Cognac region in France, and is double distilled using pot stills. Popular brands include Hine, Martell, Rémy Martin, Hennessy, Ragnaud-Sabourin, Delamain and Courvoisier.
*Portugal: Lourinhã, located in western Portugal, is one of the few brandy-making areas, besides Cognac and Armagnac, that have received appellation status.
*South African South African grape brandies are, by law, made almost exactly as in Cognac, using a double-distillation process in copper pot stills followed by aging in oak barrels for a minimum of three years. Because of this, South African brandies are of a very high quality. A popular brand is Klipdrift.
*Other countries: Grape brandy is also produced in many other countries, including Armenia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Moldova, and Pakistan.

===Fruit brandy===

Fruit brandies are distilled from fruits other than grapes. Apples, plums, peaches, cherries, elderberries, raspberries, blackberries, and apricots are the most commonly used fruits. Fruit brandy is usually clear and 80 to 90 proof. It is usually drunk chilled or over ice.

Calvados is an apple brandy from the French region of Lower Normandy. It is double distilled from fermented apples.

Eau-de-vie is a general French term for fruit brandy.

German Schnaps is fruit brandy produced in Germany or Austria.

Kirschwasser is a fruit brandy made from cherries.

Palinka is a traditional Hungarian fruit brandy. It can be made from any kind of fruit, most often from plums, apricots, elderberries, pears, or cherries. Less commonly, it is made from apples, peaches, or walnuts.

Slivovice is a strong fruit brandy made from plums; by law, it must contain at least 52% ABV. It is produced in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Poland.

Slivovitz is a fruit brandy made from plums. It is a traditional drink in Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia. Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia.

Tuica is a clear Romanian fruit brandy made from plums, apples, pears, apricots, mulberries, peaches, quinces, or mixtures of these. Romania and Moldova also produce a grape brandy called vin ars (burnt wine) or divin.

===Pomace brandy===

Pomace brandy is produced by fermentation and distillation of the grape skins, seeds, and stems that remain after grapes have been pressed to extract their juice (which is then used to make wine. Examples include the Croatian / Montenegrin / Serbian lozovača (loza), Cypriot zivania, French marc, Georgian chacha, German Tresterbrand, Greek tsipouro, Hungarian törköly, Italian grappa, Bulgarian grozdova, Portuguese aguardente, Romanian rachiu de tescovina and Spanish orujo.

Pomace is either fermented, semi-fermented or unfermented. During red wine vinification, the pomace is left to soak in the must for the entire fermentation period and is thus fermented. Fermented pomace is particularly suitable for the production of pomace brandy, as it is soft and dry, and has a high alcohol content. Semi-fermented pomace is produced during rosé wine vinification, where the pomace is removed before the fermentation period is completed, and virgin pomace, which is produced during white wine vinification, is not fermented at all. Both semi-fermented and virgin pomace need to be kept in silos until fermentation is complete.

After fermentation is complete the pomace wine is distilled.

Alcohol derived from pomace is also used as the traditional base spirit of other liquors from wine-making regions, such as Greek ouzo and other aniseed liquors.

Most pomace brandy is not aged or coloured.</text>

'''Cake flour''' is a weak or low-gluten flour, ground from soft wheat, which is wheat with a low gluten content.  Its texture is very soft and smooth and its colour very white. Cake flour is used for delicate baked goods and cakes that require a low gluten content in order to achieve a light product. Cake flour is slightly softer than [[Cookbook:Pastry Flour|'''pastry flour''']], although one sometimes hears the terms used interchangeably. It may be mixed with bread dough in order to lighten the latter for some of the sweeter yeast doughs.

[[Image:Sorghum.jpg|right|thumb|Sorghum]]

'''Sorghum''' is a genus of numerous species of grasses, some of which are raised for grain and many of which are used as fodder plants either cultivated or as part of pasture. The plants are cultivated in warmer climates worldwide. Species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of all continents in addition to the South West Pacific and Australasia. Sorghum is in the subfamily Panicoideae and the tribe Andropogoneae (the tribe of big bluestem and sugar cane). Sorghum is known as great millet and guinea corn in West Africa, kafir corn in South Africa, dura in Sudan, mtama in eastern Africa, jowar in Hindi, solam in Tamil, Jola in Kannada, and kaoliang in China. Numerous sorghum species are used for food (as grain and in sorghum syrup or &quot;sorghum molasses&quot;), fodder, the production of alcoholic beverages, as well as biofuels. Most species are drought tolerant and heat tolerant and are especially important in arid regions. They form an important component of pastures in many tropical regions. Sorghum species are an important food crop in Africa, Central America, and South Asia and is the &quot;fifth most important cereal crop grown in the world&quot;.

===Uses===

In Arab cuisine, the unmilled grain is often cooked to make cous-cous, porridges, soups, and cakes. Many poor use it, along with other flours or starches, to make bread. The seeds and stalks are fed to cattle and poultry. Some varieties have been used for thatch, fencing, baskets, brushes and brooms, and stalks have been used as fuel. Medieval Islamic texts list medical uses for the plant. In China, sorghum has long history of cultivation as a replacement for rice, which ordinary people had not been able to afford, the famous chinese liquor, maotai is also brewed from sorghum.</text>

'''Pumpernickel''' is a type of German bread traditionally made with coarsely-ground rye meal. It is now often made with a combination of rye flour and whole rye berries. It has been long associated with the Westphalia region of Germany. The first written mention of the black bread of Westphalia was in 1450. While it is not known whether this, and other early references, refer to precisely the bread that came to be known as pumpernickel, there has long been something different about Westphalian rye bread that elicited comment. The defining characteristics of Westphalian pumpernickel are coarse rye flour—rye meal—and an exceedingly long baking period. The long slow baking is what gives pumpernickel its characteristic dark color. The bread can emerge from the oven deep brown, even black. Like most all-rye breads, pumpernickel is traditionally made with a sourdough starter; the acid preserves the bread structure by inactivating the highly active rye amylases. The process is sometimes short-circuited in commercial baking by adding citric acid or lactic acid along with commercial yeast.

==Types of Pumpernickel==

Broadly speaking, there are two different pumpernickel traditions -- the Westphalian pumpernickel, made almost completely from rye and a sourdough starter, and the American Jewish tradition, in which the bread is closer to a basic American rye bread with rye flour for flavor and wheat flour for structure.

===German-style===
[[Image:Pumpernickel.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A slice of German-style pumpernickel]]
Traditional German pumpernickel contains no coloring agents, instead relying on the Maillard reaction to produce its characteristic deep brown color, sweet dark chocolate coffee flavor, and earthy aroma (however, it is not uncommon to use darkly toasted bread from a previous batch as a coloring agent). Loaves produced in this manner require 16 to 24 hours of baking in a low temperature (about 250°F or 120°C) steam-filled oven. The bread is usually baked in long narrow pans that include a lid. Like the French pain de mie Westphalian pumpernickel has little or no crust. It is very similar to rye Vollkornbrot, a dense rye bread with large amounts of whole grains added.

True German pumpernickel is produced primarily in Germany, though versions of it are sometimes made by specialty bakers outside its homeland. It is difficult to find in the United States at supermarkets and smaller groceries. German pumpernickel is often sold in small packets of pre-sliced bread. It is usually found in markets aimed at an upscale clientele because German pumpernickel is often paired with caviar, smoked salmon, sturgeon, and other expensive products of the hors d'oeuvres tray. Because of its association with expensive hors d'oeuvres it can be found throughout Europe, including in the United Kingdom, in upscale groceries, as it is in the United States and Canada.

===American Pumpernickel===

A separate pumpernickel bread tradition has developed in America. The American pumpernickel loaf approximates the dark color of traditional German pumpernickel by adding molasses, coffee, cocoa powder, or other darkening agents. In addition to coloring and flavor agents, American bakers often add wheat flour (to provide gluten structure and increase rising) and commercial yeast (to quicken the rise compared to a traditional sourdough). Because of the ways in which American bakers have changed the original German recipe, and for economic reasons, they tend to eschew the long slow baking that is characteristic of German pumpernickel. The result is a loaf that resembles commercial American rye bread -- a bread made with a mix of wheat and rye flour -- but with darker coloring. Many bakers also add a significant amount of caraway seeds, providing an alternate flavor that is now characteristic of many American commercial pumpernickel (and light rye) breads.

American pumpernickel loaves are almost always baked without a baking pan, resulting in a rounded loaf. These breads do not have the dense crumb of a traditional German pumpernickel, and have a rather different flavor profile derived from the added darkening agents and the faster baking process.

American pumpernickel bread is associated with Jewish cuisine and can often be found in stores that sell &quot;Jewish rye&quot; and other Jewish deli foods. In addition, American pumpernickel dough is sometimes combined with light rye dough to produce a type of bicolored rye bread known as &quot;marble rye&quot;, as well as being made into bagels.</text>

==1. Give the general characteristics of the palm tree referring to the following parts:== 
===a. Stem or trunk  ===
A palm trunk are usually a straight, unbranched stem, though rarely the trunk will divide into two branches.  Unlike other trees, palms add new growth to the inside of the stem.  Other trees add new growth to the outside of the trunk.  Thus, on a palm, the living wood is at the heart of the trunk and the old, dead wood is on the outside.  In non-palms, the opposite is true.

===b. Roots  ===
Palms are monocots, belonging to the same family as grass and bamboo.  As such, their roots do not gain much diameter once the plant reaches maturity.  Roots of dicots, on the other hand (that is, broadleaf plants such as oaks and maples) continue to grow and get fatter as long as the plant lives.  Thus, the roots of a dicot will destroy a sidewalk as it heaves up the concrete, while a palm will do no damage.

Palm roots are usually called &quot;rootballs' because they form round structures. Rootballs will branch a bit but do not grow larger once the tree is mature.

===c. Leaves ===
Palms have large evergreen leaves that are either palmately ('fan-leaved') or pinnately ('feather-leaved') compound and spirally arranged at the top of the stem. The leaves have a tubular sheath at the base that usually splits open on one side at maturity.
===d. Inflorescence or flowers===
The inflorescence is a panicle or spike surrounded by one or more bracts or spathes that become woody at maturity. The flowers are generally small and white, and radially symmetric. The sepals and petals usually number three each and may be distinct or joined at the base. The stamens generally number six, with filaments that may be separate, attached to each other, or attached to the pistil at the base.
===e. Fruits===
The fruit is usually a single-seeded drupe, but some genera (e.g. ''Salacca'') may contain two or more seeds in each fruit.

==2. a. What happens when the crown of a palm is cut out? &lt;br&gt;b. What happens when the trunk of a palm is damaged? ==
New growth comes from the crown, so if the crown is out out, the tree will die.  The outer layers of a palm's trunk consists of dead tissue, and as such, it will not heal (just as your fingernails and hair do not &quot;heal&quot;).

==3. In the Pacific islands there are several species of palm trees which are helpful to man. Name two of these and list as many ways as you can how each helps man. ==
===Sago Palm===
Sago is a starch extracted from the pith inside stems of the sago palm ''Metroxylon sagu''. Sago forms a major staple food for the lowland peoples of New Guinea and the Moluccas where it is called sagu and traditionally is cooked and eaten in the form of a pancake served with fish.

Sago looks like many other starches, and both sago and tapioca are produced commercially in the form of ''pearls''. These two kinds of pearls are similar in appearance and may be used interchangeably in some dishes. This similarity causes some confusion in the names of dishes made with the pearls.

In addition to its use as a food source, the leaves and spathe of the sago palm are used for construction materials, for thatching roofs, and the fiber can be made into rope.

The starch is also used to treat fiber to make it easier to machine. This process is called sizing and helps to bind the fiber, give it a predictable slip for running on metal, standardize the level of hydration of the fiber, and give the textile more body. Most cloth and clothing has been sized and this leaves a residue which is removed in the first wash.

===Coconut Palm===
The coconut palm is grown throughout the tropical world, for decoration as well as for its many culinary and non-culinary uses; virtually every part of the coconut palm has some human uses.

Nearly all parts of the coconut palm are useful, and the palms have a comparatively high yield, up to 75 fruits per year; it therefore has significant economic value. The name for the coconut palm in Sanskrit is kalpa vriksha, which translates as &quot;the tree which provides all the necessities of life&quot;. In Malay, the coconut is known as pokok seribu guna, &quot;the tree of a thousand uses&quot;. In the Philippines, the coconut is commonly given the title &quot;Tree of Life&quot;.[10] It its theorized that if you were to become stranded on a desert island populated by palm trees, you could survive purely on the tree and coconut alone, as the coconut provides all of the required natural properties for survival.


Uses of the various parts of the palm include:
==== Culinary ====
* The white, fleshy part of the seed is edible and used fresh or dried in cooking.
* Sport fruits are also harvested, primarily in the Philippines, where they are known as ''macapuno''.  They are sold in jars as &quot;gelatinous mutant coconut&quot; cut into balls or strands.
* The cavity is filled with coconut water which contains sugar, fiber, proteins, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.  Coconut water provides an isotonic electrolyte balance, and is a highly nutritious food source.  It is used as a refreshing drink throughout the humid tropics and is also used in isotonic sports drinks. It can also be used to make the gelatinous dessert nata de coco. Mature fruits have significantly less liquid than young immature coconuts; barring spoilage, coconut water is sterile until opened.
* Coconut milk is made by processing grated coconut with hot water or milk, which extracts the oil and aromatic compounds.  It should not be confused with the coconut water discussed above, and has a fat content of approximately 17%.  When refrigerated and left to set, coconut cream will rise to the top and separate out the milk. The milk is used to produce virgin coconut oil by controlled heating and removing the oil fraction. Virgin coconut oil is found superior to the oil extracted from copra for cosmetic purposes.
* The leftover fibre from coconut milk production is used as livestock feed.
* The smell of coconuts comes from the 6-pentyloxan-2-one molecule, known as delta-decalactone in the food and fragrance industry.
* Apical buds of adult plants are edible and are known as &quot;palm-cabbage&quot; or heart-of-palm. It is considered a rare delicacy, as the act of harvesting the bud kills the palm. Hearts of palm are eaten in salads, sometimes called &quot;millionaire's salad&quot;.
* Ruku Raa is an extract from the young bud, a very rare type of nectar collected and used as morning break drink in the islands of Maldives reputed for its energetic power keeping the &quot;raamen&quot; (nectar collector) healthy and fit even over 80 and 90 years old. And by-products are sweet honey-like syrup and creamy sugar for desserts.
* Newly germinated coconuts contain an edible fluff of marshmallow-like consistency called coconut sprout, produced as the endosperm nourishes the developing embryo.
* In the Philippines, rice is wrapped in coco leaves for cooking and subsequent storage - these packets are called puso.

==== Non-culinary ====
[[Image:srilanka coconut fibre.jpg|thumb|Extracting the fibre from the husk (Sri Lanka).]]
* Coconut water can be used as an intravenous fluid.
* Coir (the fiber from the husk of the coconut) is used in ropes, mats, brushes, caulking boats and as stuffing fibre; it is also used extensively in horticulture for making potting compost.
* Coconut oil can be rapidly processed and extracted as a fully organic product from fresh coconut flesh, and used in many ways including as a medicine and in cosmetics, or as a direct replacement for diesel fuel.
* Copra is the dried meat of the seed and, after further processing, is a source of low grade coconut oil.
* The leaves provide materials for baskets and roofing thatch.
* Palmwood comes from the trunk and is increasingly being used as an ecologically-sound substitute for endangered hardwoods. It has several applications, particularly in furniture and specialized construction (notably in Manila's Coconut Palace).
* Hawaiians hollowed the trunk to form drums, containers, or even small canoes.
* The husk and shells can be used for fuel and are a good source of charcoal.
* Dried half coconut shells with husks are used to buff floors. In the Philippines, it is known as &quot;bunot&quot;, and in Jamaica it is simply called &quot;coconut brush&quot;
* In the Philippines, dried half shells are used as a music instrument in a folk dance called ''maglalatik'', a traditional dance about the conflicts for coconut meat within the Spanish era
* Shirt buttons can be carved out of dried coconut shell. Coconut buttons are often used for Hawaiian Aloha shirts.
* The stiff leaflet midribs can be used to make cooking skewers, kindling arrows, or are bound into bundles, brooms and brushes.
* The roots are used as a dye, a mouthwash, and a medicine for dysentery. A frayed-out piece of root can also be used as a toothbrush.
[[Image:Srilanka coconut rug.jpg|thumb|left|Making a rug from coconut fibre.]]
* The leaves can be woven to create effective roofing materials, or reed mats.
* Fresh inner coconut husk can be rubbed on the lens of snorkeling goggles to prevent fogging during use.
* Dried coconut leaves can be burned to ash, which can be harvested for lime.
* Dried half coconut shells are used as the bodies of musical instruments, including the Chinese yehu and banhu, and the Vietnamese đàn gáo.
* Coconut is also commonly used as a herbal remedy in Pakistan to treat bites from rats.
* In World War II, coastwatcher scout Biuki Gasa was the first of two from the Solomon Islands to reach the shipwrecked, wounded, and exhausted crew of Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109 commanded by future U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Gasa suggested, for lack of paper, delivering by dugout canoe a message inscribed on a husked coconut shell. This coconut was later kept on the president's desk, and is now in the John F. Kennedy Library.
* Coconut trunks are used for building small bridges, preferred for their straightness, strength and salt resistance

==4. Identify by sight six different types of palms which grow in your area. Do this in any language. ==
The best approach for meeting this requirement is to take a good field guide with you and start looking for palm trees.  Once you find a palm tree, use the field guide to identify it.  There are field guides specific to palm trees, but these tend to be rather expensive.  However, a more general field guide to trees may have information on palms, and these are often less expensive books.  You may also find a decent field guide at your local library.

==5. Draw and name the six palm trees you have identified showing clearly the leaf formation, flowers and seed shape as well as the fruit. ==
If you have access to a camera, it is far easier to take several pictures of each specimen while you are out in the field.  The pictures can then be drawn from the photos.  Be sure to capture the leaves, flowers, seeds, and fruit so that you can reproduce them in your drawings.

You can also draw the pictures in the field.

==6. Parts of palms are used for food or to help with the preparation of food. From your culture tell how a palm tree or part of it is used as food or in food preparation e.g. sago palm, coconut palm. Tell how to prepare it.==
Sago is made through the following steps:
# Felling the sago palm tree;
# Splitting the trunk open lengthwise;
# Removing the pith;
# Crushing and kneading the pith to release the starch;
# Washing and straining to extract the starch from the fibrous residue;
# Collection of the raw starch suspension in a settling container.
The sago starch is then either baked (resulting in a product analogous to bread or a pancake) or mixed with boiling water to form a kind of paste. Sago can be made into steamed puddings such as sago plum pudding, ground into a powder and used as a thickener for other dishes, or used as a dense glutinous flour.

In Indonesia and Malaysia, sago is used in making noodles, white bread.  Pearl sago, a commercial product, closely resembles pearl tapioca. Both typically are small (about 2 mm diameter) dry, opaque balls. Both may be white (if very pure) or colored naturally grey, brown or black, or artificially pink, yellow, green, etc. When soaked and cooked, both become much larger, translucent, soft and spongy. Both are widely used in South Asian cuisine, in a variety of dishes, and around the world, usually in puddings. In India, pearl sago is called sabudana (&quot;whole grain&quot;) and is used in a variety of dishes.

[[Image:Amaranthus tricolor0.jpg|right|thumb|Amaranth]]
Amaranthus, collectively known as '''amaranth''' or pigweed, is a cosmopolitan genus of herbs. Approximately 60 species are presently recognized, with inflorescences and foliage ranging from purple and red to gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus Celosia.

Although several species are often considered weeds, people around the world value amaranths as leaf vegetables, cereals and ornamentals.

The word comes from the Greek amarantos (Αμάρανθος or Αμάραντος) the &quot;one that does not wither,&quot; or the never-fading (flower).

===Cereal=== 

A traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known vegetable has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.

Several species are raised for amaranth grain in Asia and the Americas. Ancient amaranth grains still used to this day include the 3 species, Amaranthus caudatus, Amaranthus cruentus, and Amaranthus hypochondriacus. Although amaranth was (and still is) cultivated on a small-scale in parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, India, and Nepal, there is potential for further cultivation in the USA and tropical countries and is often referred to as &quot;the crop of the future.&quot; It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons: 1) easily harvested, 2) produces a lot of fruits (and thus seeds) which are used as grain, 3) highly tolerant of arid environments which are typical of most subtropical and some tropical regions, and 4) large amounts of protein and essential amino acids, such as lysine. Due to its weedy life history, amaranth grains grow very rapidly and their large seedheads can weigh up to 1 kilogram and contain a half-million seeds. Amaranthus species are reported to have a 30% higher protein value than other cereals, such as rice, wheat flour, oats and rye.

Amaranth grain is a crop of moderate importance in the Himalaya. It was one of the staple foodstuffs of the Incas, and it is known as kiwicha in the Andes today. It was also used by the ancient Aztecs, who called it huautli, and other Native America peoples in Mexico to prepare ritual drinks and foods. To this day, amaranth grains are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with honey or molasses to make a treat called alegría (literally &quot;joy&quot; in Spanish).

Amaranth was used in several Aztec ceremonies, where images of their gods (notably Huitzilopochtli) were made with amaranth mixed with honey. The images were cut to be eaten by the people. This looked like the Christian communion to the Roman Catholic priests, so the cultivation of the grain was forbidden for centuries.[citation needed]

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, and because it is very palatable, easy to cook, and its protein particularly well suited to human nutritional needs, interest in grain amaranth (especially A. cruentus and A. hypochondriacus) was revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack sold in Mexico City and other parts of Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and other parts of North America. Amaranth and quinoa are called pseudograins because of their flavor and cooking similarities to grains. These are dicot plant seeds, and both contain exceptionally complete protein for plant sources. Besides protein, amaranth grain provides a good source of dietary fiber and dietary minerals such as iron, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, and especially manganese. Poppy seeds taste very good on cornbread.

===Vegetable===

Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a leaf vegetable in many parts of the world. There are 4 species of Amaranthus documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: Amaranthus cruentus, Amaranthus blitum, Amaranthus dubius, and Amaranthus tricolor.

In Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called bayam, while the Tagalogs in the Philippines call the plant kulitis. In Andhra Pradesh, India, this leaf is added in preparation of a popular dal called thotakura pappu. In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable and called yin choi (苋菜; pinyin: xiàncài; and variations on this transliteration in various dialects). In Vietnam, it is called rau dền and is used to make soup. There are two species popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: dền đỏ- amaranthus tricolor and dền cơm or dền trắng- amaranthus viridis. In Congo it is known as lenga lenga or biteku teku.

In the Caribbean the leaves are called callaloo and are sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup.

In East Africa Amaranth leaf is known in Swahili as mchicha. It is sometimes recommended by some doctors for people having low red blood cell count. In West Africa, Nigeria, it is known in Yoruba as efo tete or arowo jeja (&quot;we have money left over for fish&quot;). It is a common vegetable, and it goes with all Nigerian carbohydrate dishes.</text>

[[Image:Triticale.jpg|right|thumb|Tricale]]
'''Triticale''' (× Triticosecale) is a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century. The grain was originally bred in Scotland and Sweden. Commercially available triticale is almost always a 2nd generation hybrid, i.e. a cross between two kinds of triticale (primary triticales). As a rule, triticale combines the high yield potential and good grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance (including soil conditions) of rye. Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop. Depending on the cultivar, triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents. It is grown mostly for forage or animal feed although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals.

The word 'triticale' is a fusion of the latin words triticum (or wheat) and secale (rye). When crossing wheat and rye, wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent (pollen donor). The resulting hybrid is sterile and thus has to be treated with the alkaloid chemical colchicine to make it fertile and thus able to reproduce itself.</text>

'''Buckwheat''' refers to plants in two genera of the dicot family Polygonaceae: the Eurasian genus Fagopyrum, and the North American genus Eriogonum. The crop plant, common buckwheat, is Fagopyrum esculentum. Tartary buckwheat (F. tataricum Gaertn.) or &quot;bitter buckwheat&quot; is also used as a crop, but it is much less common. Despite the common name and the grain-like use of the crop, buckwheats are not grasses (and are therefore considered pseudocereals) and are not related to wheat nor other monocots. The agricultural weed known as Wild Buckwheat (Fallopia convolvulus) is in the same family, but not closely related to the crop species. Within Fagopyrum, the cultivated species are in the cymosum group, with F. cymosum L. (perennial buckwheat), F. giganteum and F. homotropicum.[1] The wild ancestor of common buckwheat is F. esculentum ssp.ancestrale. F. homotropicum is interfertile with F. esculentum and the wild forms have a common distribution, in Yunnan. The wild ancestor of tartary buckwheat is F. tataricum ssp. potanini.

===Uses===

The fruit is an achene, similar to sunflower seed, with a single seed inside a hard outer hull. The starchy endosperm is white and makes up most or all of buckwheat flour. The seed coat is green or tan, which darkens buckwheat flour. The hull is dark brown or black, and some may be included in buckwheat flour as dark specks. The dark flour is known (exaggeratedly) as &quot;blé noir&quot; (&quot;black wheat&quot;) in French, along with the name sarrazin (&quot;saracen&quot;).

Buckwheat noodles play a major role in the cuisines of Japan (soba), Korea (naengmyeon, makguksu and memil guksu) and the Valtellina region of Northern Italy (pizzoccheri). Soba noodles are the subject of deep cultural importance in Japan. In Korea, before wheat flour being replaced for making guksu, the generic term referring to noodles, buckwheat noodles were widely eaten as hot dishes. The difficulty of making noodles from flour that has no gluten has resulted in a traditional art developed around their hand manufacture.

Buckwheat groats are commonly used in western Asia and eastern Europe. The porridge was common, and is often considered the definitive peasant dish. It is made from roasted groats that are cooked with broth to a texture similar to rice or bulgur. The dish was brought to America by Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants who called it &quot;kasha&quot; and used it mixed with pasta or as a filling for knishes and blintzes, and hence buckwheat groats are most commonly called kasha in America. Groats were the most widely used form of buckwheat worldwide during the 20th century, with consumption primarily in Russia, Ukraine and Poland.

Buckwheat pancakes, sometimes raised with yeast, are eaten in several countries. They are known as buckwheat blinis in Russia, galettes in France (savoury crêpes which are especially associated with Brittany), ployes in Acadia and boûketes (that is, named the same as the plant they are made of) in Wallonia. Similar pancakes were a common food in American pioneer days. They are light and foamy. The buckwheat flour gives them an earthy, mildly mushroom-like taste. In Ukraine, yeast rolls called hrechanyky are made from buckwheat.

Farina made from groats are used for breakfast food, porridge, and thickening materials in soups, gravies, and dressings. In Korea, buckwheat starch is used to make a jelly called memilmuk. It is also used with wheat, maize or rice in bread and pasta products.

Buckwheat contains no gluten, and can thus be eaten by people with coeliac disease or gluten allergies. Many bread-like preparations have been developed.

Besides the seeds, from which buckwheat flour is produced, buckwheat is also a good honey plant, producing a dark, strong monofloral honey.

Buckwheat greens can be eaten. However, if consumed in sufficient quantities, the greens, or, more commonly, their juice, can induce sensitization of the skin to sunlight known as fagopyrism. Fair skinned people are particularly susceptible, as are light pigmented livestock. Enthusiasts of sprouting, however, eat the very young buckwheat sprouts (four to five days of growth) for their subtle, nutty flavour and high nutritional value. They are widely available in Japan.</text>

[[Image:Millet.png|right|thumb|Millet]]
The '''millets''' are a group of small-seeded species of cereal crops or grains, widely grown around the world for food and fodder. They do not form a taxonomic group, but rather a functional or agronomic one. Their essential similarities are that they are small-seeded grasses grown in difficult production environments. It was millets, rather than rice, that formed important parts of prehistoric diet in Chinese Neolithic and Korean Mumun societies.

===Nutrition===

The protein content in millet is very close to that of wheat; both provide about 11% protein by weight.

Millets are rich in B vitamins, especially niacin, B17, B6 and folic acid, calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, and zinc. Millets contain no gluten, so they are not suitable for raised bread. When combined with wheat or xanthan gum (for those who have coeliac disease), though, they can be used for raised bread. Alone, they are suited for flatbread.

As none of the millets are closely related to wheat, they are appropriate foods for those with coeliac disease or other forms of allergies/intolerance of wheat. However, millets are also a mild thyroid peroxidase inhibitor and probably should not be consumed in great quantities by those with thyroid disease.

===Uses===
Millets are principally food sources in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. In Western India, millet flour (called &quot;Bajari&quot; in Gujarati and marathi) has been commonly used with &quot;Jowar&quot; (Sorghum called &quot;Jwari&quot; in Marathi) flour for hundreds of years to make the local staple flat bread (called &quot;Rotla&quot;).

Millets are traditionally important grains used in brewing millet beer in some cultures, for instance by the Tao people of Orchid Island and, along with sorghum, by various peoples in East Africa.

Millet is used to prepare boza fermented drink in Balkan peninsula countries.

Millet is the base ingredient for the distilled liquor, rakshi, in Nepal.

Millet porridge is a traditional Russian food, eaten sweet (with milk and sugar added at the end of cooking process) or savoury with meat or vegetable stews.

Coeliac patients can replace certain cereal grains in their diets by consuming millets in various forms including breakfast cereals.

Millet can often be used in recipes instead of buckwheat, rice, or quinoa.

Millet sprays are often recommended as healthy treats to finicky pet birds, as they are easily eaten and (in the case of destruction-prone hookbills) easily broken.

Millet, and other birdseed, is commonly used as fillings for juggling beanbags.

===Preparation===

The basic preparation consists in washing the millet and toasting it while moving until one notes a characteristic scent. Then five measures of boiling water for each two measures of millet are added with some sugar or salt. The mixture is cooked covered using low flame for 30-35 minutes.</text>

'''Arrowroot''' is the name of the edible starch from the rhizomes (rootstock) of West Indian arrowroot.

===Cultivation and preparation===

Arrowroot tubers contain about 23% starch. They are first washed, then cleaned of the paper-like scale, washed again, drained and finally reduced to a pulp by beating them in mortars or subjecting them to the action of the wheel-rasp. The milky liquid thus obtained is passed through a coarse cloth or hair sieve and the pure starch, which is insoluble, is allowed to settle at the bottom. The wet starch is dried in the sun or in a drying house. The result is a powder, the &quot;arrowroot&quot; of commerce, and it is at once packed for market in air-tight cans, packages or cases.

Arrowroot starch has in the past been quite extensively adulterated with potato starch and other similar substances, so care is needed in selection and buying. Pure arrowroot, like other pure starches, is a light, white powder (the mass feeling firm to the finger and crackling like newly fallen snow when rubbed or pressed), odorless when dry, but emitting a faint, peculiar odor when mixed with boiling water, and swelling on cooking into perfect jelly, which can be used to make a food for vegetarians, very smooth in consistency—unlike adulterated articles mixed with potato flour and other starches of lower value which contain larger particles.

===Uses===

Arrowroot is used as an article of diet in the form of biscuits, puddings, jellies, cakes, hot sauces, etc., and also with beef tea, milk or veal broth, noodles in Korean cuisine, or boiled with a little flavoring added, as an easily digestible food for children and people with dietary restrictions. Arrowroot makes clear, shimmering fruit gels and prevents ice crystals from forming in homemade ice cream. It can also be used as a thickener for acidic foods, such as oriental sweet and sour sauce.

The lack of gluten in arrowroot flour makes it useful as a replacement for wheat flour in baking. Like other pure starches, however, arrowroot is almost pure carbohydrate and devoid of protein, thus it does not equal wheat flour nutritionally.

Arrowroot thickens at a lower temperature than does flour or cornstarch. It is recommended to mix arrowroot with a cool liquid before adding to a hot fluid. The mixture should be heated only until the mixture thickens and removed immediately to prevent the mixture from thinning. Overheating tends to break down arrowroot's thickening property. Substitute two teaspoons of arrowroot for one tablespoon of cornstarch, or one teaspoon of arrowroot for one tablespoon of wheat flour.

If you eat a large quantity of arrowroot it may cause stomach pains and very bad gut illnesses.</text>

[[Image:Sjb whiskey malt.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Malted barley]]

'''Malting''' is a process applied to cereal grains, in which the grains are made to germinate by soaking in water and are then quickly halted from germinating further by drying/heating with hot air. Malting is thus a combination of two processes; notably the sprouting process and the kiln-drying process. These latter terms are often preferred when referring to the field of brewing for batches of beer or other beverages as they provide more in-depth information.

The term '''malt''' refers to several products of the process:
the grains to which this process has been applied, for example malted barley;
the sugar, heavy in maltose, derived from such grains, such as the baker's malt used in cereals like Rice Krispies; or
a product based on malted milk, similar to a malted milkshake (i.e., &quot;malts&quot;).

Whisky or beer can also be called malt, as in Alfred Edward Housman's aphorism &quot;malt does more than Milton can, to justify God's ways to Man.&quot;

===Uses===

Malted grain is used to make beer, whisky, malted shakes, and malt vinegar. Malting grains develops the enzymes that are required to modify the grain's starches into sugars, including monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, etc.) and disaccharides (sucrose, etc.). It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases which break down the proteins in the grain into forms which can be utilized by yeast. Barley is the most commonly malted grain in part because of its high diastatic power or enzyme content. Also very important is the retention of the grain's husk even after threshing, unlike the bare seeds of threshed wheat or rye. This protects the growing acrospire (developing plant embryo) from damage during malting, which can easily lead to mold growth. It also allows the mash of converted grain to create a filter bed during sparging (see brewing). Other grains may be malted, although the resulting malt may not have sufficient enzymatic content to convert its own starch content fully and efficiently and may create a &quot;stuck sparge&quot;</text>

[[Image:Perry bottled in Normandy.jpg|thumb|Traditional perry (''poiré'' in [[French language|French]]) is bottled champagne-style in Normandy]]


'''Perry''' or '''pear cider''' is an alcoholic beverage made of fermented pear juice. It is similar to cider, in that it is made using a similar process and often has a similar alcoholic content, up to 8.5% alcohol by volume.

Perry has been common for centuries in Britain, particularly the West Country and Wales; and France, especially Normandy and Anjou. Sweden also produces perry, such as Kopparbergs, Herrljunga Cider or Rekorderlig Cider. As with cider, special pear cultivars are used: in the UK the most commonly used variety of perry pear is the Blakeney Red. They produce fruit that is not of eating quality, but that produces superior perry. Perry pears are higher in tannin and acid than eating or cooking pears, and are generally smaller.

Perry from Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England made from traditional recipes forms a European Union Protected Geographical Indication.

One may also find perry distilled, in a similar style to applejack.</text>

Hi, you bring up some topics that are near and dear to my heart. In my opinion, one requirement of being a good teacher is  having passion, which creates energy. The kids sense that you care, which makes them want to work harder and do better. Also, letting the students express their opinion gives them a sense of ownership, lending to increased accountability and responsibility. Making the class interesting is another required ingredient of teaching. If the children are interested, they want to learn, and would possibly be motivated to learn new things independantly. And finally, when a teacher has a desire to expand their philsophy as they become more experienced, it demostrates a true passion for teaching.[[User:Dcask002|Dcask002]] ([[User talk:Dcask002|talk]]) 16:05, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

I hope you have great success in your teaching career.  I wish I had teachers like you when I was going to school because some teachers didn't take the time to get to know how to get the kids to learn.   We need more teachers to show passion towards their job.  To show the children that we care about them and their well being.  I wish more teachers would try to get to know not only the children but their parents as well.  [[User:Dfost019|Dfost019]] ([[User talk:Dfost019|talk]]) 13:20, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

I totally agree with your philosophy! You seem to have great passion for teaching! We need teachers out there who have that mentality. If you believe you can make a difference and be creative in doing so, thats what makes a great teacher! Good Luck in all that you do!! :)

[[User:Vlane02|Vlane02]] ([[User talk:Vlane02|talk]]) 00:22, 14 September 2008 (UTC) Teaching is special field. If you like what you are doing and you have that in your soul for teaching, you will be great. Loving the job you are doing is the special key for sucess.
You are lucky to have during your school years wonderful teachers that impressed you. Your teacher philosophic about how to introduce English to your class and &quot;Othello&quot; to the students with them doing the acts and scenes is a neat idea. Hope you will make a good plan into this activity. Good luck in your journey.

I agree with a lot of your philosphy of education.  I agree that one of the most important parts of teaching is making the class interesting so students stay engaged.  Teachers also have to be very passionate and to always try to motivate your students to do better.  I'm sure you'll make a great teacher.

Amanda! you were in my public speaking class last semester! And I rememer your speech about your brother and his autism and I still think that it was a really great speech haha. As far as your philosophies of education I agree with a lot of it. I am doing a project in my english comp class and we have to pick a topic about teaching that intrests us and i picked the importance of a fun and interesting learning environment. I agree that keeping students engaged is important and doing what it takes to kee p them engaged is even more important. See you in class!! [[User:Apomo004|Apomo004]] ([[User talk:Apomo004|talk]]) 02:28, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

Hey- 
sounds you have a great personality to be a successful teacher, and I admire anyone who can teach others chemistry, haha!
I'm terrible at chemistry to say the least. I agree with your philosphy of education, you do have to get childrens attention and make learing matters fun. I think that if you do so that it is much easier for students to learn and want to learn! Its hard for children to learn about stuff that they are not interested in, and by getting them interested will make for greater success![[User:Jlamb029|Jlamb029]] ([[User talk:Jlamb029|talk]]) 13:33, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

Amanda, i love seeing that you desire for a person's passion to come out no matter what they are doing.  I think that is key to being a good teacher, seeing that your students are being empowered to create and develop their passion no matter what subject.  I would love to see your work!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Who is this?==
George Washington
==What did he do that made him important?==
George Washington (1732-1799) is the best known and most important founding father.  Before becoming President, he was a soldier, serving as a colonel in the [[US History/Road to Revolution#The French and Indian War|French and Indian War]] and as the leader of the Continental Army during the [[US History/American Revolution|American Revolution]] against [[wikipedia:England|England]].  He was also head of the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Constitution|Constitutional Convention]], when the United States wrote the basic laws that govern our country.  He is called the “Father of Our Country” because without him, many believe that the United States would not have existed, at least as we know it.{{-}}

===Commander-in-Chief===
[[Image:Portrait of George Washington.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|George Washington as Commander-in-Chief.]]
George Washington was unanimously selected Commander-in-Chief of the American Army in June of 1775.  Washington was offered pay for the job, but he declined any money, except for his expenses.  He went to Boston where the army had surrounded the city and trapped the British inside.  In March of 1776, Washington forced the British to evacuate the city by putting cannon on top of hills outside of the city.  Washington then led his army to New York City, and the British attacked in August 1776.  The Americans were defeated and forced to retreat.  They were defeated over and over again and forced to fall back into New Jersey, and then into Pennsylvania.  It seemed like the revolution was lost, because the troops contracts would end in one week.  Washington knew he had to save him army, and so he came up with a daring plan.  He led his army across the Delaware River, back into New Jersey on Christmas Night, 1776, in the middle of a blizzard.  After a dangerous crossing, Washington marched his army to Trenton, where they surprised, and defeated the Hessians (Soldiers the British hired from Germany).  About 900 Hessians were captured.  This victory changed the American soldiers minds about wanting to go home, and they agreed to stay longer.  The next week, on January 3, Washington attacked Princeton New Jersey.  It seemed like the Americans were going to lose but then Washington rode out on his horse, rallied his soldiers, and defeated the British.  This victory forced the British to leave New Jersey.

In 1777, the British attacked Philadelphia, and Washington moved his army to stop them, but he was defeated at Brandywine, south of the city. An attempt by Washington to retake the city failed in October, and he was forced to withdraw to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. That winter, over 2,000 of his troops died from starvation or the cold. Many men left, and it looked like the army would fall apart. But Washington never gave up. He worked the whole day, everyday, to get food and blankets for his soldiers, and the army held together. When spring came in 1778, the army was trained by Baron von Steuben, a Prussian soldier. In June, the British left Philadelphia, and went to New York. While they were on their way, Washington attacked them, at Monmouth, New Jersey. At first it looked like the Americans would be defeated because a General had retreated when Washington had told him not to. However, Washington came onto the field, and, once again, rallied his troops and forced the British back.

In 1779 and 1780, Washington did not fight any battles against the British. The British had decided to attack in the south and work their way up the colonies. Washington left his army in the Hudson Valley in New York to make sure the British would not attack up the Hudson River. 

In August 1781, Washington received news that a French Fleet(The French were allies with the Americans) was going to go to Virginia.  Washington knew that there was a British army under the command of Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown Virginia.  He decided to move his army down south and surround the British Army, while the French Fleet blocked the sea so they could not escape.  After bombing Yorktown with cannon for almost a month, the British Army surrendered.  The Americans and French captured 9,000 British Soldiers. 
[[Image:BattleofMonmouth.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Washington rallying his troops at Monmouth.]]
After Yorktown, the British and Americans began to talk to each other and tried to make peace. While they did this, Washington moved his army to Newburgh, New York.  In March of 1783, the officers in the army who had not been paid in a long time, decided that they were going to go to Philadelphia, and march to Congress, who was supposed to pay them.  Washington realized that is they did this, his army would fall apart.  He called for a meeting with his officers, and gave a magnificent speech, but his officers were not convinced.  Washington then took out a letter from Congress and tried to read it, but he could not, so he took out his spectacles.  He said &quot;Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country.&quot;  When he said this, his officers realized how hard Washington had worked to give American its independence, and they began to cry.  Washington finished reading the letter, and then left the room.  The officers pledged their loyalty and promised not to march to Congress.

Peace was signed with Great Britain on September 3, 1783, and the soldiers went home.  On December 23, Washington resigned as Commander-in-Chief.  Washington was offered to become king, and could have easily taken over the government as many others have done in the past, but he did not want to become king and believed that a Republic was better.  After resigning, Washington retired to his home, Mount Vernon Virginia, and arrived just in time for Christmas.

===Presidency===
[[Image:Gilbert Stuart Williamstown Portrait of George Washington.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Washington's Presidential Portrait.]]
Washington came out of retirement in 1787 and was unanimously elected to be the President of the Philadelphia convention. At the convention, the Constitution was drafted and it replaced the Articles of Confederation. Not everyone supported the Constitution, but Washington did, and his support convinced many states to pass it. 

In 1789, Washington was unanimously elected President of the United States.  He had not wanted to be president, but he thought that if he did not become president, that the country would fall apart.  Congress voted to pay him $25,000 but he declined.  After thinking it over, he decided to take it to show that you did not have to be wealthy to become president.  People argued over what to call the president, some wanted him to be called &quot;His Highness the President of the U.S. and protector of their liberties&quot; but Washington preferred the simply name &quot;Mr. President&quot;.  At first Washington met with all of his advisors separately, but he decided this was not the best thing to do, and he met with them all together.
[[Image:WhiskeyRebellion.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Washington crushing the Whiskey Rebellion.]]
In 1792, Washington wanted to retire back to Mount Vernon, but he still feared that the country could not survive without him, so he decided to run again. He was, once again, unanimously voted President. In 1794, a new tax on Whiskey angered many people living on the frontier in Pennsylvania. Protests turned into riots, and Washington knew that is he did not take action, it would show other parts of the country that they could revolt. Washington personally took command of the militia, and when the rioters saw that he was in command, they ran away. 

Later in 1794, threat of another war with Great Britain prompted Washington to sent diplomat John Jay to London to negotiate a treaty.  He did, and it was called the Jay Treaty.  The treaty had the British move off of forts on American territory, and the United States increased trade with Britain.  The treaty was not popular, but it was passed, and avoided war with Britain.

In 1796, Washington announced he would not run for President again. He wrote his Farewell address, in which he said that America should not go into European Wars, and should not engage in permanent alliances with any nation. He also advised against Political Parties. In March 1797, Washington once again retired to Mount Vernon.

==What did he do when he was young?==
[[Image:Washington 1772.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Washington in his Virginia Militia uniform.]]
George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, on the Potomac River southeast of modern-day Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County, Virginia. When George was 11 years-old, his father died. From the point on he looked up to his half brother, Lawrence Washington, as his father. Lawrence wanted Washington to join the British Navy in 1747, but George's mother, Mary Bell Washington, put her foot down and said no. Because of his father's death, George did not go to England to school like his other brothers had. Instead, Lawrence and others tutored him. In 1749, George became a surveyor.  Lawrence died in 1752, and he left his property to George, who named it Mount Vernon. There is an old story that George chopped down a cherry tree, and when his father questioned asked him is he knew who had, George said &quot;Father, I cannot tell a lie. I did it with my hatchet.&quot; Most historians today believe that it is a myth.

Through family connections, George became a Major in 1752 in the Virginia Militia.  In the early 1750s Washington was used as an ambassador to the French trappers on the Western Frontier in the Ohio River Valley.  His most important mission came in 1753, when Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Washington with an ultimatum to demand that the French leave the territory claimed by Virginia.  While he was there, Washington was asked to assess the French military strength.  Washington successfully completed his mission, although he almost died on the trip.  The French response was clear, they would not leave.  Afterward Washington was promoted to  Lieutenant Colonel.

In 1754, Washington was again sent to the Frontier.  He was sent with a regiment of soldiers to reinforce a fort that was being constructed at current day Pittsburgh.  However, before he got there, the French arrived and ordered the Colonists to leave.  The French built Fort Duquesne in its place.  After receiving this news, Washington received more news.  A French party of soldiers was advancing through the wilderness towards Virginia.  Washington believed that they were a raiding party, and in response, he ambushed them, on May 28.  Along with some help from Native American allies, the French party was defeated.  The leader of the French party was wounded, and handed Washington some papers that showed that they were on a diplomatic mission.  While Washington was reading the papers, one of his Native American allies came up and smashed the Frenchman's head, washing his hands in his brain. 

Washington began to build a Fort, and called it Fort Necessity. Washington assumed that the French would attack, and they did on July 3. After a day long battle, the larger French and Indian force forced Washington to surrender. In the surrender document, which was in French which Washington could not read, it said that Washington had assassinated the French leader. The French allowed Washington and his men to return to Virginia. Washington was not blamed for the defeat but the Militia was reorganized, and Washington would have been demoted to Captain. Unhappy with this, he resigned.

In 1755, Washington became an Aide to Edward Braddock's expedition to take Fort Duquesne. On the march, the British were ambushed, and Braddock killed. Washington took command, and made an orderly retreat. He became known as the Hero of the Monongahela. Washington was promoted to Colonel. He was given control on the Virginia Militia.
[[Image:BattleofFortDuquesne.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Washington tips his hat to the British flag over Fort Duquesne after capturing it in 1758.]]
Over the next three years, Washington turned the Virginia Militia into one of the finest fighting machines in the colonies.  They skirmished with the French and Indians, and in 1758, launched another expedition, called the Forbes Expedition, led by John Forbes.  A first assault on Fort Duquesne failed, but the French commander knew he could not hold out much longer.  Therefore he abandoned the fort, burning it to the ground.  The British came and built a new one in its place, called Fort Pitt.  After this victory, Washington retired from the military, and went to Mount Vernon.

In 1759, Washington married  Martha Dandridge Custis, one of the wealthiest widows in the colonies.  With this marriage, he expanded his property to 6,500 acres by 1775. In 1758 he was elected to the House of Burgesses, the Virginia provincial legislature.  Washington resented the taxes that Britain imposed onto the colonies, and became actively involved in opposition in 1767.  In May 1769, Washington introduced a proposal drafted by his friend George Mason which called for Virginia to boycott English goods until the Acts were repealed.  They were repealed in 1770.  However, the Intorable acts were passed in 1773, and he called them &quot;an Invasion of our Rights and Privileges&quot;.  In 1774, he was elected as a delegate to the First Continental Congress.

==What did he do afterward?==
After he retired in 1797, Washington returned Mount Vernon. But he was not retired for long. In 1798, it looked like that the United States would go to war with France and John Adams, the new president, thought that George Washington should take control of the Army. Washington reluctantly did, and began to organize and train the army. When the crisis with France passed in 1799, Washington returned to Mount Vernon. On December 12, 1799, he was out inspecting his plantation in the rain and hail. He did not wash up before eating, and he developed an infection in the throat. The Doctors treatment did not help him, it only made him worse. On December 14, 1799 George Washington died. In his will he had all of his, and his wife's slaves freed on her death.

==How do we remember him today?==
Today, countless things are named after George Washington. His face is on the One Dollar Bill and on the Quarter. His face is on Mount Rushmore. The Capital of the United States in named Washington D.C. in his honor. 33 counties, 244 townships, 16 mountains, 1 state, 2 islands, 6 major parks, 1 parkway, 1 major bridge, 3 ports, 5 forts, 11 Universities, countless number of schools, and streets are all named after George Washington.

I do agree that with you about the lesson plan being somethin the student can relate to. Because then it will peek their interest.    [[User:Tfrat001|Tfrat001]] ([[User talk:Tfrat001|talk]]) 00:56, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

Hi! I used to work as a server at Cheeseburger in Paradise! I loved serving!But sometimes people can be so rude and aggravating when you are a server haha. I also agree that a fun environment in the classroom is key to helping students feel engaged in what they are learning!

Aubrie, I know how difficult to work as a waitress while going to school. I did it for 4 years while obtaining my Bachelor's Degree, and I am now working a full time job while obtaining licensure. I agree with you that teaching is a fun classroom is the key. You have to keep the children's attention to truly reach them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definitions ==

Open Educational Resources (OER) are “digitized materials offered freely and openly for educators, students and self-learners to use and re-use for teaching, learning and research.” This term was first adopted at UNESCO’s 2002 Forum on the Impact of Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries funded by the Hewlett Foundation (source [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources Wikipedia]).

A [http://www.hewlett.org/Programs/Education/OER definition of OER from The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation] is:

&quot;OER are teaching, learning and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use or re-purposing by others. Open educational resources include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials or techniques used to support access to knowledge.&quot; 

If you are unfamiliar with the terms used in this course, you may want to bookmark the following glossaries.

*[http://oerwiki.iiep-unesco.org/index.php?title=OER_glossary International Institute for Educational Planning (IIEP) OER Glossary]

*[http://cnx.org/content/m15223/latest/ ISKME Glossary]

*[http://wiki.icommons.org/index.php/OER_Lexicon_-_A_Primer_on_OER-related_Terms iCommons Primer on OER-related Terms]

The term OER has been used to refer to learning materials such as:

*Learning objects (quizzes, crossword puzzles, flashcards, animations, interactive maps, timelines, etc.) 

*Audio lectures

*Audiovideo lectures

*Images

*Sounds and music 

*Entire course content 

*Collections of journal articles and institutional repositories 

*Textbooks

Some more current definitions of Open Educational Resources place just as much emphasis on the PROCESS of creating open knowledge and promoting least restrictive knowledge-sharing as on the content itself.  For example, although content in this tutorial was originally only available from an online course that has an open license, it did NOT fit the definition of an OER because it required registration and was password-protected.  By contrast, the following courses are considered OER because they do not limit access:

*Development Gateway Foundation offers an [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Composing_free_and_open_online_educational_resources Introduction to Open Educational Resources: The Wikiversity online course about Composing free and open online educational resources]started March 3, 2008.

*[http://cnx.org/content/col10413/latest/ Introduction to Open Educational Resources course available at Connexions]

Another example is a graphic from the [http://school.discoveryeducation.com/clipart/clip/titerope.html Clip Art Gallery] on DiscoverySchool.com.  Such a graphic is probably NOT considered to be an OER because it does not have an open license that allows for altering the image.  The use and development of OER is somewhat of a balancing act between competing interests and needs, especially with regard to intellectual property.

The [http://www.okfn.org/ Open Knowledge Foundation] has defined open knowledge as &quot;A piece of knowledge is open if you are free to use, reuse, and redistribute it.”  A full [http://www.opendefinition.org/1.0/ definition] is available.  

Be sure that you understand the difference between learning content that is freely available and OER. 

Although a resource may be accessible for FREE over the Internet, it may be protected by a copyright that does not permit reuse and reproduction for either commercial or non-commercial purposes. For example, [http://www.pbs.org/aboutsite/aboutsite_rules.html PBS.org] allows educators to freely use images and text from their website under certain conditions however some of the restrictions mean that many would not consider it a repository of OER.  Another example is an [http://www.ochem4free.info/node/2 Organic Chemistry textbook] that is freely available but could not be considered an open textbook due to its copyright restrictions.  OER are typically distributed as public domain or with an open license that allows others to share, adapt and use the content freely.  

Ideally, OER repositories (such as [http://www.opendoar.org/find.php OpenDOAR]) should clearly display the policies for inclusion of OER to ensure that the content has some sort of open license that permits sharing and reuse.  We will explore this issue further in the Chapter on Fair Use, Copyright, and TEACH Act.

== Background ==

The Open Educational Resources movement is part of a global effort to make knowledge available to all. The [http://www.unesco.org/iiep/virtualuniversity/forumsfiche.php?queryforumspages_id=13 UNESCO's Virtual University Forum] provides an overview about definitions, initiatives, and community-building. OER is seen by some as a means to provide students in developing countries with access to affordable learning content.  For more about this global effort, see this article by Sally M. Johnstone, founding Director of Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications (WCET), in Educause Quarterly titled: [http://connect.educause.edu/Library/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/OpenEducationalResourcesS/39931 Open Educational Resources Serve the World].  Richard Baraniuk, a Rice University professor, presents a vision for free, global education and introduces Connexions, an open-access publishing service, in this 19 minute [http://youtube.com/watch?v=RRymi-lFHpE video] recorded at the TED Conference in February 2006.  
 
This tutorial will focus primarily on the OER movement in the United States, however. If you want to become better informed about the global OER movement, go to [http://www.unesco.org/iiep/eng/focus/opensrc/opensrc_1.htm UNESCO's IIEP] to request membership in the international OER Community of Interest.

The [http://www.hewlett.org/Programs/Education/OER/Publications/oeroverview.htm Hewlett Foundation] has taken a pioneering role in the development and use of OER with its support of many initiatives: &quot;The Open Educational Resources movement began in 2001 when the Hewlett and the Andrew W. Mellon foundations jointly funded MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW), the first institution committed to making all of its course materials freely available. Since then, more than 60 additional institutions have launched OpenCourseWare Web sites.&quot;  For background about Hewlett Foundation's involvement in the OER movement, watch this presentation by Catherine Casserly, Program Officer: [http://ocwblog.org/?p=71 &quot;Open Educational Resources: Unlocking Knowledge to the Global Community.&quot;]

== Video Overview of OER ==


As an alternative to reading text, you may prefer to get an overview of OER by watching Dr. Cable Green's webinar video: Developing a Culture of Sharing and Receiving: Open Educational Resources Feb. 11, 2008. 

== Case Study ==


In his May 2006 article Bye the Book My year of teaching environmental science without a textbook, Eric Pallant describes how he and co-professor Terry Bensel experimented with teaching their Introduction to Environmental Science course at Allegheny College with no textbook. Instead they used a variety of open educational resources. Based on self-report, 41 of 46 students in their first-semester class read the same or more than they would have in a textbook. The experiment proved successful enough that the entire academic department has embraced the concept of OER. Faculty have distributed the work of collecting and banking websites for common use.  We will address the use of Open Textbooks in more detail in another Chapter.

Other case studies are being collected at the Case Study Research Project wiki. 

== Benefits and Disadvantages ==

In the recommended reading, you will find some of the ''benefits'' of OER.  These include: 

•	Fosters pedagogical innovation and relevance that avoids teaching from the textbook 

•	Broadens use of alternatives to textbooks while maintaining instructional quality 

•	Lowers cost of course materials for students 

Think of what other benefits there might be.

Some ''disadvantages'' of OER include: 

•	Quality of available OER materials inconsistent 

•	Materials may not meet Section 508 ADA accessibility or SCORM requirements and must be modify to bring into compliance 

•	No common standard for review of OER accuracy and quality 

•	Need to check accuracy of content 

•	Customization necessary to match departmental and/or college curriculum requirements 

•	Technical requirements to access vary

•	Technological determinism created by the delivery tool 

== OER Mini-Handbooks ==

An example of OER development in action is the OER Mini-handbook series.  The Center for Sustainable and Open Learning (COSL) and the Hewlett Foundation sponsor this is a dynamic wiki at wikieducator.org as a guide for those who are new to OER development and licensing. Take a look at the different mini-handbooks available for: 

•	Educators

•	Institutions 

•	Policymakers 

Instructions: If you want an additional introduction to OER, read the first half of this OLCOS tutorial: OLCOS Intro to OER Tutorial

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Open CourseWare movement began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2002 and has now spread to over 120 other universities worldwide.  MIT first announced its Open Courseware program in 2001. The OCW provides open access to course materials for up to 1,550 MIT courses, representing 34 departments and all five MIT schools. The goal is to include materials from all MIT courses by 2008. MIT OCW's goals are to: 1) Provide free, searchable, access to MIT's course materials for educators, students, and self-learners around the world, and 2) Extend the reach and impact of MIT OCW and the opencourseware concept. 

MIT has been so successful with its Open Courseware initiative that it now provides a How-To site for institutions wanting to launch their own Open Courseware project. Making the Case for Open Courseware is outlined by MIT on their How-To site in terms of: 
*Benefits for users and for global society 
*Benefits for the institution and its community 
*Open courseware cost components 
*Answers to common concerns 

Many other Open Courseware projects are now underway: Top 100 Open Courseware Projects.  As far as I know, the only community college to offer Open Courseware is Foothill College: see the SOFIA Project.

According to MIT: The open courseware concept is a part of the larger movement that promotes free and unrestricted access to knowledge. An opencourseware site provides open access to the primary teaching materials for courses taught at educational institutions, enabling educators to draw on the materials for teaching purposes, and students and self-learners to use the materials for the development of their own personal knowledge.  Furthermore, MIT defines an open courseware site as: 
*Publishes course materials created by faculty (and sometimes other colleagues or students) to support teaching and learning 
*Is IP-cleared, meaning that the open courseware publisher has the rights to make the materials available under open terms and that nothing in the materials infringes the copyrights of others 
*Offers the materials free of charge for non-commercial use 
*Is universally accessible via the Web 
*Permits use, reuse, adaptation (derivative works), and redistribution of the materials by others 

The Open Courseware Consortium &quot;is a collaboration of more than 100 higher education institutions and associated organizations from around the world creating a broad and deep body of open educational content using a shared model. The mission of the OpenCourseWare Consortium is to advance education and empower people worldwide through opencourseware.&quot;  According to the Open Courseware Consortium, an Open CourseWare site is a “free and open digital publication of high quality educational materials, organized as courses...is available for use and adaptation under an open license...does not typically provide certification or access to instructors.”  

==Case Studies==
The detailed MIT Open Courseware Story is available for downloading as a 36 page PDF. 

A project is underway in New Zealand to provide an open course repository.  The goal of the New Zealand Open Educational Resources project is to increase the quality of eLearning materials, increase flexibility in their re-use and significantly reduce the duplication of investment in their design, development and production. The objectives of the NZ OER project are:
#To develop some 'proof of concept' courseware that is freely available to all tertiary education institutions in New Zealand. 
#To develop a model to initiate future projects for the benefit of the education sector at a system-wide level, on the basis of a successful pilot. 

==OCW Sites==
You can use the Open CourseWare Finder to search for OER course content from: 
*MIT OCW 
*Utah State University OCW 
*Johns Hopkins School of Public Health OCW 
*Tufts University OCW 
*Foothill De-Anza SOFIA 
*Carnegie Mellon Open Learning Initiative 
Other universities with open courseware include:
*University of California, Irvine 
*University of Notre Dame 
*University of Washington Computer Science &amp; Engineering 
*Stanford on iTune 
*Penn State 

==Open Course Sites==
Wikiversity is an online group of educators engaged in a collaborative learning effort using wiki software, which makes collaboration easy. Take the guided tour to discover more. 

HippoCampus, a project of the Monterey Institute for Technology and Education (MITE), provides high-quality, multimedia content on general education subjects to high school and college students free of charge.

Free University Lectures has a search function that makes it easier to find podcasts and videos of lectures in a specific discipline, however, it only includes four categories: physics, chemistry, computer science, and mathematics. The Free University Lectures blog provides up-to-date information about open courses. 

Award winning podcasts from the University of Bath's public lecture series feature leading names from the worlds of science, humanities and engineering talking about the latest research in their field.

== Activities ==
===Experience===
#Use the Open CourseWare Finder to search for Open Courseware in your teaching discipline. 
#Listen to a lecture podcast at Stanford on iTunes, Berkeley Lectures or Yale on iTunes. 
#Participate in the Wikiversity Colloquium. 

===Reflect===
#Do you believe that your own college/university should have Open Courseware?  Why or why not? (If your own college already has Open Courseware, please tell us how it is perceived by the faculty and students.)  

===Apply===
#Develop a lesson plan that repurposes learning content from OCW for your own teaching. 
#Consider adding your own course to Wikiversity. Use the tutorial provided. 

== Skills/Objectives ==
Learners will be able to:

#Identify sources of open courseware for use in their own teaching disciplines. 
#Locate at lesson in an open course to modify for use in teaching.

----

&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;Hello! My name is Aubrie and I am 20 years old. I am a transfer student from tcc and this is my first semester at ODU! I currently live in Virginia Beach and work as a server at a restaurant call Texas Roadhouse.  I am fully committed to school during the week, but the weekends are my time. If im not at work, I am usually hanging out with my boyfriend of 3 years. I am working towards a BA in Physical Education and Health. Im hoping to become a Physical Education teacher and coach a high school girls lacrosse team.&lt;/font&gt;'''

&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;I believe teaching in a positive and fun classroom enviornment is key.  In order to keep students interested, the curriculum should be carefully planned. Teachers should not only consider the grade level being taught, but also the enviornment in which the school is located.  There are numerous factors that come into play when it comes to having a successful education.  My number one focus is that the students are not only learning the material but also having fun.&lt;/font&gt;'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Who’s jkova003? I’ll tell you…
My name is Jessica Kovalcik and this is a little bit about me:

==='''EDUCATION'''===
:I graduated from Caroline High School in Milford, VA, in 1989, where I was a member of the Art Club and National Honor Society. In 1993, I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a BFA in painting and printmaking. I am currently in the Licensure Only program at Old Dominion University and hope to be teaching elementary school art within the next couple of years.

==='''PERSONAL'''===
:The oldest of 3 children, I have an identical twin sister who is 6 minutes younger than I, and a brother 4 years younger. I grew up in the country, playing in the woods, riding horses and surrounded by a variety of animals, including chickens, rabbits, horses, dogs and cats. My father was a logger back then and my mother was a teacher and still is an artist. Growing up I was constantly surrounded by and exposed to art and it greatly influenced me. I always knew I wanted to do something with art when I grew up.

:In 1996, I married a fellow artist (and musician) and in 1997, we moved to Philadelphia, PA. In 2002, our son was born and as much as we loved Philadelphia, we moved back to VA to be close to our families. For the past 6 years, I’ve been a stay-at-home mom, only within the past year and a half working part time for my father-in-law. Being a stay-at-home mom was very important to me, and my husband and I made sacrifices so that I could do it. The majority of my time is devoted to my family and home, and they will always come first before anything else I do, but now that my son is in school full time, I’ve decided to move forward and accomplish something about which I am passionate… teaching art!
 
:Though I am very busy these days, I do have a multitude of interests (besides art) including music (I like mostly the underground/ indie/punk stuff.) architecture, water, traveling, baking, gardening, knitting, riding my bike, and reading. 

==='''MY EDUCATION PHILOSOPHY'''===

This may change slightly as I go through school, but for now this is what I believe:

:I believe every child has the right to an education and every child should have an opportunity to learn. Teachers should be in the classroom to pass on knowledge as well as nurture and set good examples, reinforcing basic morals and ethics to those who are taught them at home and teaching to those who do not receive such guidance at home.

:I believe learning should be fun. Teachers should be enthusiastic about what they teach and find creative ways to do it. To this day I can still recite all the prepositions in the English language because of a song my 5th grade teacher created. 

:On that note, I believe the arts play a huge role in education and they serve not only to foster aesthetics, but to open the minds and teach creative thinking and expressiveness in children. I think every child should have the opportunity to be exposed to all of the arts and to leave any out of the curriculum of a class is to severely hinder that student from an opportunity to expand his or her mind. While not every child may be interested in all or some of the arts, I think it is extremely important for every child to be exposed to and experience them.
 
:I also believe that not every child learns the same way. Teachers should be aware of this and adjust their teaching to the needs of each child. Thus, I believe in small classrooms. The smaller the classroom, the more individual attention a child may receive.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Me ==
I am a transfer student to ODU.  This summer, I finally completed by Associate of Science degree at TCC.  My major is Theatre Education.  I have been involved in theatre since I was 10 years old, and I can't think of anything I like to do more.  I grew up as a Navy brat, and have lived in places like Guam and Belgium.  I have two dogs, a Labrador Retriever and a Walker Hound.  They are my babies, and I love them to death![[Image:Arleigh.jpg|thumb]]



== Teaching Philosophy ==
I feel like being a teacher is more than just lecturing information to students so they can pass a standardized test.  I want to get kids excited about learning.  Since my focus will be in the arts, I want to show students that music, dance, art, and theatre are about more than entertainment.  Knowing about and loving the arts will help them in all walks of life.  I think it's important as an educator to be enthusiastic about your &quot;craft&quot;.  It's our job to show our kids how to get excited and be creative about learning.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Charlescarrollofcarrollton.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Charles Carroll of Carrollton]]
==Who is this?==
Charles Carroll of Carrollton

==What did he do that made him important?==
Charles Carroll (1737&amp;ndash;1832) was a signer of the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].  He was the signer of the document who lived the longest.  He was also the only signer who was Roman Catholic.

Carroll was a critic of the British policies to the Colonies. He said it was up to the colonies to whether they should be taxed or not. He wrote in the Maryland Gazette and protested the Governor's actions. From 1774 to 1776, Carroll was a member of the Annapolis Convention. He was commissioned with Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase and his cousin John Carroll in February 1774 to ask Canada to become the 14th colony. He was a member of Annapolis' first Committee of Safety in 1775. In early 1776, while not yet a member, the Congress sent him on a mission to Canada. When Maryland decided to support the open revolution, he was elected to the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, and remained a delegate until 1778. He arrived too late to vote in favor of it, but was able to sign the Declaration of Independence. 

Carroll returned to Maryland in 1778 to assist in the drafting of a constitution and forming a state government. Carroll was re-elected to the Continental Congress in 1780, but he declined. He was elected to the state senate in 1781 and served there continuously until 1800. When the United States government was created, the Maryland legislature elected him to the first United States Senate. In 1792 Maryland passed a law that prohibited any man from serving in the State and national legislatures at the same time. Since he preferred to be in the Maryland Senate, he resigned from the U. S. Senate on November 30, 1792. He retired from Public life in 1801.

==What did he do when he was young?==

==What did he do afterward?==
Charles Carroll lived for over fifty years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  In his later years, he returned to life as a plantation owner.  Late in life, he was one of the founders of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  He died in 1832 at the age of 95.

==How do we remember him today?==

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''bend knot''' is a knot used to join two lengths of rope.

Although the [[Knots/Binding knots/Reef knot|Reef knot]] can be used in this way, it is insecure when used as a bend and so is not classed as one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Square_knot.svg|thumb]]
The '''reef knot''' or '''square knot''' is a common and simple [[../|binding knot]].

== Tying a reef knot ==
To tie a reef knot, tie a left-handed [[Knots/Stopper knots/Overhand knot|overhand knot]] and then a right-handed overhand knot or vice versa.  (Two consecutive overhands of the same handedness will make a [[granny knot]].)  A common mnemonic for this procedure is &quot;right over left, left over right&quot;, which is often appended with the rhyming suffix &quot;... makes a knot both tidy and tight&quot;.

The [[Knots/Parts of the knot|working end]]s of the reef knot must be ''cis'' (that is, both at the top or both at the bottom); the other lines lead to the full rope.  Otherwise, a [[Knots/Trick knots/Thief knot|thief knot]] results.  (The &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; terms are derived from terminology used to describe [[w:geometric isomerism|geometric isomerism]].)

== Uses ==
Used to tie two ends of a single line together such that they will secure something that is unlikely to move much.  It lies flat when tied with cloth, and has been used for [[First Aid|bandages]] for millennia.  With both ends tucked (slipped) it becomes a good way to tie shoelaces, whilst the non-slipped version is useful for shoelaces that are excessively short.  It is also used decoratively and to tie the Obi (or belt) of a martial arts keikogi.  Finally, it is quite handy for tying plastic garbage or trash bags, as the knot forms a handle when tied in two twisted &quot;ears&quot;.

This knot's name originates from its use to &quot;[[w:Reefing|reef]]&quot; [[w:sail|sails]] (tie part down to decrease effective surface area), where its easy-spilling behavior was very handy.  A sailor could collapse it with a pull of one hand; the sail's weight would make the collapsed knot come apart.

The reef knot is one of the key knots of macrame textiles.

=== Misuse ===
[[Image:Capsizereefknot111.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The reef knot can capsize (spill) when one of the free ends is pulled outward.]]
The reef knot's ease of tying and visually appealing symmetry belie its weakness.  It is popular as a general-purpose binding knot.  In particular, it figures prominently in [[Scouting]] worldwide: each Scout is said to know the square knot, and it is pictured in the international membership badge.

The International Guild of Knot Tyers warns that this knot should never be used to [[../../Bend knots|bend]] two ropes together.  A proper bend (such as the [[double fisherman's knot]]) should be used instead.  Some knotting guides claim that misused reef knots cause more deaths and injuries than all other knots combined.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy 1985, ''The Klutz Book of Knots''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Thief knot ===
The thief knot is an intentional mis-tie of the knot, where the open ends are on opposite sides.  It is traditionally used as an inexpensive method of detecting if a sack was opened where the thief would retie a standard reef knot. However, it does not provide as much strength for binding ropes. 

=== Granny knot ===
The granny know is a mis-tie of the knot by tying both portions of the knot in the same direction.  This knot can release suddenly and unpredictably, and should be avoided.

=== Grief knot ===
The grief knot shares common properties of both the thief knot and the granny knot, and likewise it is a weak knot.  It is more of a trick knot, as it is possible to &quot;lock&quot; the knot so that it won't slip; however, locking this knot does not guarantee as much strength as the normal reef knot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Palstek innen.jpg|thumb]]
The '''bowline''' (''bow-linn'') is an ancient but simple knot used to form a fixed loop at the end of a rope.  The structure of the bowline is identical to that of the [[Knots/Bend knots/Sheet bend|sheet bend]], except the bowline forms a loop in one rope and the sheet bend joins two ropes. Along with the sheet bend and the [[Knots/Hitch knots/Clove hitch|clove hitch]], is often considered one of the most essential knots.

The name has an earlier meaning, dating to the age of sail. On a square-rigged ship, a bowline (sometimes spelled as two words, ''bow line'') is a rope that holds the edge of a square sail towards the bow of the ship and into the wind, preventing it from being [[wikt:take aback|taken aback]]. A ship is said to be on a &quot;taut bowline&quot; when these lines are made as taut as possible in order to sail [[w:points of sail|close-hauled]] to the wind.

== Usage ==
[[Image:BowlineHeaderImage.jpg|thumb|left|The bowline makes a good leash or other loose attachment.]]
The bowline is used mainly to make a temporary loop at the end of a line.  Like the other similar knots, it can be made and then secured over an object like a post.   Since the bowline is generally tied with the [[Knots/Parts of the knot|working end]], it can be passed through a ring or other object before the knot is tied.  This feature makes the bowline a convenient and useful loop knot.

The bowline, or more commonly one of its variations such as the [[Knots/Loop knots/Double bowline|double bowline]], is sometimes used by climbers to tie the end of the rope to a climbing harness, or the like. The advantage of the bowline in this application is that the knot is easy to untie even after it has been loaded.  The disadvantage is that, while it is a very strong knot under load, it has a tendency to loosen up and become untied when it is unloaded and shaken around over a period of time, as might happen during a climb. Several other knots are more commonly used in modern climbing technique.

This knot can be used in an emergency to hoist a person to safety, since the loop can slipped over a victim's torso, under the armpits, and it will not tighten around the victim's chest and prevent breathing.  This is useful when a rescue harness is not available.

The bowline is commonly used in sailing small craft, for example to fasten a [[w:halyard|halyard]] to the head of a sail or to tie a [[w:jib sheet|jib sheet]] to a [[w:clew|clew]] of a [[w:jib|jib]].

A rope with a bowline retains about 65% of its strength at the location of the knot.

== Tying ==

A mnemonic used to teach the tying of the bowline is to imagine the end of the rope as a rabbit, and where the knot will begin on the standing part, a tree trunk. First a loop is made near the end of the rope, which will act as the rabbit's hole. Then the &quot;rabbit&quot; comes up the hole, around and under the tree, and then back down the hole. When this configuration is tightened, a bowline has been tied. An alternative &quot;lightning method&quot; can also be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Webbing''' is a  fabric woven as a flat strip or tube of varying width and fibers often used in place of rope.  The name webbing comes from the meshed material frequently used in its construction, which resembles a web. It is a versatile component used in climbing, slacklining, furniture manufacturing, automobile safety, auto racing, towing, parachuting, military apparel, and many other fields.  Modern webbing is often made from exceptionally high-strength material, such as [[w:Dyneema|Dyneema]], [[w:Nylon|Nylon]], [[w:Polyester|Polyester]], and [[w:Kevlar|Kevlar]]. Webbing is both light and strong, with [[w:Tensile strength|breaking strengths]] readily available in excess of 10,000 [[w:Pound-force|lb]] (44.4 k[[w:newton|N]])
[[Image:Webbing.jpg|thumb|200px|2 [[inch]] (50 [[Millimetre|mm]]) [[Nylon]] webbing as used in [[auto racing]] harnesses]]

==Sporting goods==
In rock climbing, nylon webbing is used in [[w:sling (climbing equipment)|slings]], runners, [[w:climbing harness|harnesses]], anchor extensions, etriers (ladders) and [[w:quickdraw|quickdraws]]. 
The most popular webbing is one inch but it is available in two and three inch widths which in earlier days were often used in lieu of climbing harnesses. Wrapped around the waste several times, they were less bulky and more comfortable than the old school method of tying the rope around the waste. More elaborate configurations would include leg loops, which were essential to hold a climber who had fallen or otherwise found themselves dangling. If left supported only by rope or webbing wrapped around the waste, breathing would be constricted and many climbers died as a result of the lack of support which did not constrict the diagphram. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Narrower webbing is frequently looped through chockstones which are typically metal in shapes such as hexagonal, square, tubular, T, etc., and which are jammed into cracks as safety anchors. In other cases, webbing is looped over rock outcroppings. Unlike tubular rope, webbing is less likely to inch its way off the rock. Note that webbing construction is either utterly flat or flat-tubular; the latter tends to handle better but knots are more likely to jam.
&lt;br /&gt;
The most popular knots in webbing are the water knot and the grapevine knot. The latter is stronger, but uses more webbing for the knot. It is customary to leave a couple inches extending from the knot, and in many cases climbers tape the ends down onto the main loops. Webbing is also less expensive than rope of similar size particularly kernmantle rope which requires elaborate and expensive manufacturing. Unlike rope, which has manufacturers seeking brand identification and customer loyalty, webbing manufacture is typically generic. Climbing shops sell it off of a spool on a per yard or per foot basis. It is cut with a hot wire as is nylon rope, which prevents fraying and unravelling. However, when webbing does fray and unravel, the result is less disastrous than with rope, which is another albeit minimal advantage. Webbing suffers the drawback of less elasticity than perlon rope, and it may be more difficult to handle with gloves or mittens on. &lt;ref&gt; Royal Robbins, Basic Rockcraft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Royal Robbins, Advanced Rockcraft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The Freedom of the Hills by the Seattle Mountaineers &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Common-whipping.png|300px|[[Common whipping]] knot|right|thumb]]

A '''whipping knot''' or '''whipping''' is a binding of [[../Twine/]] around the end of a rope to prevent the fibres of the rope from unravelling. 

When a rope is cut, there is a natural tendency for the cut end to fray.  A whipping is one way to try to prevent this, by applying multiple turns of twine (sometimes called &quot;small stuff&quot;) tightly around the rope very near the cut end.  The whipping can be made neat and permanent by tying it off or sewing the ends of the twine through the rope.

When doing this to thick sailing-ship-type rope, the &quot;small stuff&quot; used was sometimes [[w:whipcord|whipcord]], hence the word usage.

Whipping is suitable for synthetic and natural ropes and lines.  It is suitable for both stranded and braided ropes, lines and cables (3-strand rope, 4-strand cable and 8-strand multiplait as well as concentric and braided constructions).

Whipping takes time and some skill to apply, and may need specialist equipment (palm, needle etc). It provides a neat, soft, aesthetic, and permanent ending to the rope.

*[[/Portuguese whipping/]]

==Alternatives to whipping==

===Constrictor knot===

A [[../Binding knots/Constrictor|Constrictor knot]] or a turn of self-adhesive plastic tape can be used temporarily to hold the fibres of a cut line until a final whipping can be applied.

===Melting===

The ends of some [[../Synthetic fibres/]] such as Dacron, Nylon, polyethylene, polyester, or polypropylene may be melted to fuse the fibers together and prevent their ends from fraying.   This may be done by cutting through the rope with an electrically heated rope cutter, or cutting with a knife and melting the ends in a flame.

Although quick to apply and taking no great skill to learn, melting has a number of disadvantages. Many believe that melting the ends is most appropriate for finishing small-stuff, but is not recommended for working ropes and lines.  Melting the fibers is a relatively poor method of finishing a rope's end, and the end of any rope subject to heavy use should be whipped as well.  Melting cannot be done on wet rope and is often untidy when done on used or dirty rope. The melted end will be hard and can cause injury for example if flicked in the face.  With age, use and ultraviolet damage, the hard end will crack and the sharp edges so produced can cut the hands in use, especially if the end runs through the palms.  The melting process can easily be overheated causing an unsightly, rough, blackened end, especially if a hot flame is used.  Melting is difficult to do outdoors in any breeze and, if the rope is overheated or catches fire, can produce toxic fumes in an enclosed space.  There is a fire or injury risk on a boat, especially if the fibres catch fire and molten or burning plastic begins to drip.

Melting cannot be used on natural fibre ropes and lines, or on some types of synthetic lines. [[../Natural fibres/]] like [[w:manila hemp|manila]], [[w:sisal|sisal]], [[w:cotton|cotton]] and [[w:hemp|hemp]] will burn instead of melt. [[w:Aramid|Aramid]] fiber such as [[w:Kevlar|Kevlar]] cannot be melted - the fibers merely char. Such rope must be finished with an appropriate whipping - ideally one completed with a needle such as a [[/Sailmaker's whipping]] although a [[/West country whipping]] also serves well.

===Back splice===

Whipping is not to be confused with [[../Splicing/]], which uses the rope's own fibres. Splicing can be used to end a rope, to join two ropes together, or to join one rope to itself to form an eye or loop.

A [[../Splicing/Back splice/]] can be applied to the end of any rope, especially stranded ropes. It is most suitable for bucket ropes and other lanyards.

A back splice adds extra thickness to the end of the rope, so that it will no longer pull through [[block_(sailing)|blocks]] and sheaves. The extra thickness may however be seen as an advantage as it allows the user to feel the end of the rope coming into the hand, for example on a bucket lanyard when fetching water from a river bank or from the deck of a boat.

To be truly robust and permanent, the ends of the strands may still need whipping, or the whole splice serving after the back-splice is finished as this work will not be held in permanent tension, and may tend to unravel if banged around in use.

Splicing takes time and skill to apply, and may need special equipment ([[w:fid|fid]] and small-stuff or self-adhesive tape) while working.

===Liquid whipping===

Another modern alternative is &quot;liquid whipping&quot;.  This is a commercial, glue-like product that is used by dipping the end of the rope into the liquid.  When it sets, the product is flexible but solid enough to keep the rope together.  Liquid whipping can be used on both natural and synthetic fibers.

===Aglet===

An [[w:aglet|aglet]] is a permanent ending applied mechanically to bind the end of the rope. A typical example is the plastic aglet at the end of a shoelace. Metal aglets may be [[w:crimp|crimped]] onto ropes or cables.  Aglets may also be made by melting a softer metal to cap the end of the cable.

A '''rope''' is a length of fibres, twisted or braided together to improve strength for pulling and connecting. It has [[w:tensile strength|tensile strength]] but is too flexible to provide [[w:compressive strength|compressive strength]] (it can be used for pulling, but not pushing). Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, line, string, or twine.

==Construction==
Common materials for rope include [[../Natural fibres/]] such as [[w:Manila hemp|Manila hemp]], [[w:hemp|hemp]], [[w:linen|linen]], [[w:cotton|cotton]], [[w:coir|coir]], [[w:jute|jute]], and [[w:sisal|sisal]]. 

[[../Synthetic fibre|Synthetic fibres]] include [[w:polypropylene|polypropylene]], [[w:nylon|nylon]], [[w:polyester|polyesters]] (e.g. [[w:polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], [[w:LCP|LCP]], [[w:HPE|HPE]], [[w:Vectran|Vectran]]), [[w:polyethylene|polyethylene]] (e.g. [[w:Dyneema|Spectra]]), [[w:Aramid|aramids]] (e.g. [[w:Twaron|Twaron]], [[w:Technora|Technora]] and [[w:Kevlar|Kevlar]]) and [[w:polyaramid|polyaramids]] (eg [[w:Dralon|Dralon]], [[w:Tiptolon|Tiptolon]]). Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres.

==Styles of rope construction==
===Laid or twisted rope===

Laid rope, also called ''twisted rope'', is historically the prevalent form of rope, at least in modern Western history. Most twisted rope consists of three strands and is normally right-laid, or given a right-handed twist. Typically, a three strand laid rope is called a plain or hawser-laid rope. A four strand rope is usually called ''shroud-laid'', and a rope twisted out of 3 or more ropes is called ''cable-laid''.

[[Image:Metters rope serpentine vtm.jpg|thumb|Rope making using the twisted rope method on a 1928 Metters Rope Making Machine]]
Twisted ropes are built up in three steps. First, fibers are gathered and spun to form yarns. A number of these yarns are then twisted together to form strands. The strands are then twisted together to form the rope. The twist of the yarn is opposite to that of the strand, and that in turn is opposite to that of the rope. This counter-twisting helps keep the rope together. On the other hand, rope constructed in this manner untwists under tension, which is the cause of spinning, kinking, hockling and stretching. Any rope of this type must be [[../Whipping|bound]] at its end by some means to prevent untwisting. Twisted ropes have a preferred direction for coiling. Normal right laid rope should be coiled ''with the sun'', or clockwise, to prevent kinking. Coiling this way imparts a twist to the rope. One of the drawbacks of this construction is that every fiber is exposed to abrasion numerous times along the length of the rope. This means that the rope can degrade to numerous inch-long fiber fragments, which is not easily detected visually.

=== Braided rope ===
[[Image:SuperMacro Rope.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Thick decorative rope.]]
Braided ropes are generally made from nylon, polyester or polypropylene.  Nylon is chosen for its elastic stretch properties and good resistance to ultraviolet light.  Polyester is about 90% as strong as nylon but stretches less under load, is more abrasion resistant, has better UV resistance, and has less change in length when wet.  Polypropylene is preferred for low cost and light weight (it floats on water).  

'''Single braid''' consists of even number of strands, eight or twelve being typical, braided into a circular pattern with half of the strands going clockwise and the other half going anticlockwise. The strands can interlock with either twill or plain weave. The central void may large or small; in the former case the term '''hollow braid''' is sometimes preferred.
'''Double braid''', also called '''braid on braid''', consists of an inner braid filling the central void in an outer braid, that may be of the same or different material. Often the inner braid fiber is chosen for strength while the outer braid fiber is chosen for abrasion resistance.
In '''solid braid''' the strands all travel the same direction, clockwise or anticlockwise, and alternate between forming the outside of the rope and the interior of the rope. This construction is popular for general purpose utility rope but rare in specialized high performance line.

[[w:Kernmantle rope|Kernmantle rope]] has a core (kern) of long twisted fibers in the center, with a braided outer sheath or mantle of woven fibers.  The kern provides most of the strength (about 70%), while the mantle protects the kern and determines the handling properties of the rope (how easy it is to hold, to tie knots in, and so on).  In dynamic climbing line, the core fibers are usually twisted, and chopped into shorter lengths which makes the rope more stretchy.  Static kernmantle ropes are made with untwisted core fibers and tighter braid, which causes them to be stiffer in addition to limiting the stretch.

Braided ropes (and objects like garden hoses, [[w:optical fiber|fiber optic]] or [[w:coaxial cable|coaxial]] cables, etc.) that have no ''lay'', or inherent twist, will uncoil better if coiled into ''[[w:figure 8|figure-8]]'' coils, where the twist reverses regularly and essentially cancels out.

=== Other types ===
'''Plaited rope''' is made by braiding twisted strands, and is also called ''square braid''. It is not as round as twisted rope and coarser to the touch. It is less prone to kinking than twisted rope and, depending on the material,  very flexible and therefore easy to handle and knot. This construction exposes all fibers as well, with the same drawbacks as described above. '''Brait rope''' is a combination of braided and plaited, a non-rotating alternative to laid three-strand ropes. Due to its excellent energy-absorption characteristics, it is often used by arborists.  It is also the most popular rope for anchoring and can be used as mooring warps.  This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage.

==Handling rope ==
[[Image:Cordages-mutin.jpg|thumb|Cordage aboard the French training ship ''Mutin'']]
Rope made from hemp, cotton or nylon is generally stored in a cool dry place for proper storage. To prevent kinking it is usually coiled. To prevent fraying or unraveling, the ends of a rope are bound with twine, tape, or heat shrink tubing.  The ends of plastic fiber ropes are often melted and fused solid.  

If a load-bearing rope gets a sharp or sudden jolt or the rope shows signs of deteriorating, it is recommended that the rope be replaced immediately and should be discarded or only used for non-load-bearing tasks.

==Line==
A piece of rope that has a specific purpose is called a line, especially in nautical usage.  Examples include clothesline, chalk line, anchor line, stern line, fishing line etc.

The '''Butterfly Loop''', also known as the '''Lineman's Loop''' or  '''alpine butterfly loop''', is a &quot;non-jamming [[../|loop]] on the bight&quot;: a loop which may be tied in a rope with two fixed ends, and can take loads on both ends of the original rope, and on the loop.  The alpine butterfly loop is a symmetrical and more secure version of the butterfly loop.

==Usage==
[[Image:Alpine butterfly on the bight howto.jpg|thumb|left|Tying an alpine butterfly on the bight.]]
The Butterfly Loop has a high breaking strength and is regarded by mountaineers as one of the strongest knots to attach climbers to the middle of a rope, such that they have room to move around even when the main rope goes tight, and they can be supported in either direction from the main rope.  The loop is typically attached to a climbing harness by [[w:carabiner|carabiner]].

It can also be used to isolate a worn section of rope, where the knot is tied such that the worn section is used for the centre of the loop (which of course does not receive a carabiner or bears any loads in this case).

==Advantages==
* Does not reduce the strength of the rope by very much
* Will not slip (after initial settling)
* Allows for the knot to be loaded three ways (each end of the main line and by the loop)
* Relatively easy to undo after loading (more difficult if wet)
* Very easy to adjust the size of the bight

==Disadvantages==
* Difficult to tie one-handed
* Difficult to casually inspect
* Requires some training/practice to master

The '''sheepshank''' is a type of knot (or, more accurately [[../Unknots|unknot]]) that is used to shorten a rope or take up slack. The knot has several features which make it suitable for this purpose:

* It provides two loops, one at each end of the knot which can be used to pass another rope through
* The knot remains secure under tension; the coarser the rope the more secure it is (see Disadvantages, below)
* The knot falls apart easily when tension is removed

The last of these attributes is invaluable. Other knots will bind tightly and be almost impossible to undo if the knot has been placed under great tension. The sheepshank, by contrast, comes apart quite easily.

== Construction Methods ==
A sheepshank knot may be constructed as follows:
* Pull a section of rope back and lay it alongside the rope, so that the rope forms a Z approximately 20 cm long.
* Flatten the Z so that there are 3 sections of rope lying alongside each other, with two U-bends where the rope reverses direction.
* At each U-bend, grasp the U-bend in one hand, thus holding two of the rope sections. With the other hand form a small loop in the remaining section and draw it over the U-bend so that the loop forms a half hitch and stays there if the free end of the rope is pulled taut.
:: Many people draw the small loop over facing the wrong way at least half of the time.  Instead, make with the U a half-hitch around the other part, by tucking through, then pull the U straight.
* Repeat at the other U-bend.

An alternative method for quickly constructing a sheepshank is as follows:

* Create a simple loop in the rope, so that the (left) leading end is on top of the (right) trailing end of the loop.
* Repeat this process further down the rope to create 3 total loops that overlap slightly (similar to a [[venn diagram]] with three circles).
* Reach through the outer two loops and grab either side of the middle loop and pull outward while also keeping the rest of the rope slightly taut.
* Once the middle loop is pulled through the outer loops, pull on the free ends of the rope to secure.

The result is a flattened loop which is held at each end by a [[half hitch]]. If the sides of the flattened loop are pulled away from each other, the flattened loop ends pull out of the half hitches and the knot falls apart, but if the free ends
are pulled taut then the knot remains secure.

== Usage ==
Sheepshank knots are typically used for securing loads to trucks or [[Trailer (vehicle) | trailers]], and in [[sailing]] applications.

==Disadvantages==
The sheepshank was developed before the use of modern &quot;slippery&quot; [[../../Synthetic fibre/]] ropes. Constructed from such ropes, under load, it can fail. It is strongly advised that one test the knot under load before trusting it.

==Variants==
===Man-o'war sheepshank===
The '''man-o'war sheepshank''' is a sheepshank knot with a [[Handcuff knot]] in the middle.  This configuration with the half-hitches formed close to the central knot is used in rope rescue and is called a [[Fireman's chair knot]].

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE. --&gt;

This template is intended as a meta-template: a template used for constructing other templates. it is not meant for use directly in an article, but can be used on a one-off basis if required. See [[w:Help:Infobox|Help:Infobox]] for an introduction to infoboxes and information on how to design them. See [[:Category:Infobox templates]] for specific infobox templates.

=== Usage ===
Usage is similar to {{tl|navbox}}, but with an additional distinction. Each row on the table can contain either a header, or a label/data pair, or just a data cell. These are mutually exclusive states so if you define a row with both a header and a label/data pair, the label/data pair is ignored.

To insert an image somewhere other than at the top of the infobox, or to insert freeform data, use a row with only a data field.

==== Number ranges ====
To allow flexibility when the layout of an infobox is changed, it may be helpful when developing an infobox to use non-contiguous numbers for header and label/data rows. Parameters for new rows can then be inserted in future without having to renumber existing parameters. For example:
&lt;pre&gt;|header3  = Section 1
|label5   = Label A
|data5    = Data B
|label7   = Label C
|data7    = Data C
|header10 = Section 2
|label12  = Label D
|data12   = Data D&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Parameters ===
====View/discuss/edit links====
;name : The template page name that the &quot;view/discuss/edit&quot; links should point to. You can use &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subst:PAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. If this parameter is omitted the view/discuss/edit links will not be displayed.

====Title====
{{Infobox
|title = Text in caption over infobox
|subheader = Subheader of the infobox
|data1 = (the rest of the infobox goes here)
}}
{{Infobox
|above = Text in uppermost cell of infobox
|subheader = Subheader of the infobox
|subheader2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; subheader of the infobox
|data1 = (the rest of the infobox goes here)
}}

There are two different ways to put a title on an infobox. One contains the title inside the infobox's border, the other puts it on top as a caption. You can use both of them together if you like, or just one or the other, or even neither (though this is not recommended).
;title : Text to put in the caption over top of the table.
;above : Text to put within the uppermost cell of the table.

====Optional content====
;subheader, subheader2 : additional title fields which fit between {{{title}}} and {{{above}}}.
;image, image2 : images to display at the top of the template. Use full image syntax, for example &lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:example.png|200px|alt=Example alt text]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Image is centered by default.
;caption1, caption2 : Text to put underneath the images.
;header(n) : Text to use as a header in row n.
;label(n): Text to use as a label in row n.
;data(n): Text to display as data in row n.
;below: Text to put in the bottom cell. The bottom cell is intended for footnotes, see-also, and other such information.

Note: currently, headers, labels and data items with the same n-value are mutually exclusive; only the header will be displayed. See the rendering of header4, label4, and data4 in the examples section below.

====Optional CSS styling====
;bodystyle : Applies to the infobox table as a whole
;titlestyle : Applies only to the title caption. Adding a background color is usually inadvisable since the text is rendered &quot;outside&quot; the infobox.
;abovestyle : Applies only to the &quot;above&quot; cell at the top. The default style has font-size:large; since this cell is usually used for a title, if you want to use the above cell for regular-sized text include &quot;font-size:medium;&quot; in the abovestyle.
;imagestyle : Applies to the cell the image is in. This includes the text of the image caption, but you should set text properties with captionstyle instead of imagestyle in case the caption is moved out of this cell in the future.
;captionstyle : Applies to the text of the image caption.
;headerstyle : Applies to all header cells
;labelstyle : Applies to all label cells
;datastyle : Applies to all data cells
;belowstyle : Applies only to the below cell

==== HTML classes ====
;bodyclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox as a whole.
;titleclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's title caption.
;aboveclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's &quot;above&quot; cell.
; aboverowclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the complete table row the &quot;above&quot; cell is on.
; subheaderclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's subheader.
; subheaderrowclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the complete table row the subheader is on.
;imageclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the image; it is in particular used in conjunction with {{tl|Image class names}}.
; imagerowclass1, imagerowclass1 : These parameters are inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the complete table row the respective images are on.
;rowclass(n) : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the specified row '''including''' the label or other explanatory text.
;class(n) : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the data cell of the specified row. If there's no data cell it has no effect.
;belowclass : This parameter is inserted into the &quot;class&quot; attribute for the infobox's below cell.

==== Microformats ====

This template supports the addition of microformat information. This is done by adding &quot;class&quot; attributes to various data cells, indicating what kind of information is contained within. To flag an infobox as containing [[w:hCard|hCard]] information, for example, add the following parameter:

&lt;pre&gt;
|bodyclass = vcard
&lt;/pre&gt;

And for each row containing a data cell that's part of the vcard, add a corresponding class parameter:

&lt;pre&gt;
|class1 = fn
|class2 = org
|class3 = tel
&lt;/pre&gt;

...and so forth. &quot;above&quot; and &quot;title&quot; can also be given classes, since these are usually used to display the name of the subject of the infobox.

===Making fields optional===
A row with a label but no data is not displayed. This allows for the easy creation of optional infobox content rows. To make a row optional use a parameter that defaults to an empty string, like so:

&lt;pre&gt;
|label5 = Population
|data5  = {{{population|}}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This way if an article doesn't define the population parameter in its infobox the row won't be displayed.

For more complex fields with pre-formatted contents that would still be present even if the parameter wasn't set, you can wrap it all in an &quot;#if&quot; statement to make the whole thing vanish when the parameter is not used. For instance, the &quot;#if&quot; statement in the following example reads &quot;#if:the parameter ''mass'' has been supplied |then display it, followed by 'kg'&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;
|label6 = Mass
|data6  = {{#if:{{{mass|}}}|{{{mass}}} kg}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

For more on #if, see [[m:ParserFunctions##if:|here]].

You can also make headers optional in a similar way. If you want a header to appear only if one or more of the data fields that fall under it are filled, one could use the following pattern as an example of how to do it:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;{{Infobox
|name    = {{subst:PAGENAME}}
|title   = Example of an optional header
|header1 = {{#if:{{{item_one|}}}{{{item_two|}}}{{{item_three|}}}|Optional header}}
|label2  = Item one
|data2   = {{{item_one|}}}
|label3  = Item two
|data3   = {{{item_two|}}}
|label4  = Item three
|data4   = {{{item_three|}}}
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

header1 will be shown if any of item_one, item_two, or item_three is defined. If none of the three parameters are defined the header won't be shown.

The trick to this is that the &quot;if&quot; returns false only if there is nothing whatsoever in the conditional section, so only if all three of item_one, item_two and item_three are undefined will the if statement fail.

===Examples===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Test Infobox
|titlestyle   = 

|image        = [[File:example.png|200px|alt=Example alt text]]
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = Caption for example.png
|captionstyle = 
|headerstyle  = background:#ccf;
|labelstyle   = background:#ddf;
|datastyle    = 

|header1 = Header defined alone
|label1  = 
|data1   = 
|header2 = 
|label2  = Label defined alone
|data2   = 
|header3 =

Looks like this is a class project. If you guys need something, just ask (the [[WB:ADMIN|admins]] are usually around). If you like, you can help us keep track of class projects by registering this one at [[Wikibooks:List of class projects]]. This way, the regulars will know that you're working as a group on this project and we can better help out. A good starting point for anyone involved in this is [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]] - just a quick primer so you know how things are done around here.

Finally, if there's an instructor or group leader, please identify them to us as such. Having a single contact point makes life much easier.

I hope all of you find this as exciting a project as I (and the other folks here) do. My [[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|talk page]] is always available if you need anything, or [[WB:HELP]] is read by the community at large. Happy editing! &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:07, 29 August 2008 (UTC)

==='''Thanks and question'''===
Hi, this is Sasha [[User:Sidorkin]], the project leader. Yet, it is a class project, and I will add myself to the cover page as a contact. I am not sure how some pages look just like regulalr pages, and I haver to insert a link back to the cover page, while others already have the link back, and called modiles. How do you add a module?
:You just name the page [[Literature Reviews for Doctoral Students in Education/Whatever]] - as long as you have the slash followed by the chapter/section name, you will get links back up the hierarchy. You can see [[WB:NP]] for additional information. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:51, 5 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

My name is Kelli Byrd DelSorbo. I am from Southwest Virginia and that is where I am taking this course, at the Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center. I am a graduate of Virginia Tech with a degree in Communications. I discovered out of college that I really had a passion for children and teaching. My mother, grandmother and aunt are all teachers so maybe it runs in our blood. So now I am going back to get my certificate to teach Pre K-6. 
As I said I live in Southwest Virginia and would like to teach in the town of Abingdon, where I grew up or any town nearby. I am really looking forward to teaching and having my own classroom. I know it will be a challenge everyday but I believe it will be rewarding and worth any stress or headaches a long the way. I have always loved working with children and am fascinated by them. I think it will be amazing to watch young children grown and learn everyday.

SPORT-Football

TEAMS-Virginia Tech Hokies and the New York Giants

FOOD-Mexican

== MY TEACHING PHILOSOPHY ==

I believe that teaching should not only be a job but a lifelong goal. Teachers should not settle for getting their students to the next grade but should strive to help mold them into good citizens while teaching them about content and life. A great teacher has a lifelong impact on a student and contributes to that students well being and its growing up process.

There are many factors that go into teaching and being successful at it. I believe that you must deal with diversity and turn it into a positive. Not all students have equal resources at home and many have different cultural and social backgrounds. This does not have to be a bad thing though. Teachers must recognize which students have which skills and which students need extra help. A teacher must not assume that all students are equal in abilities and backgrounds and that there must be different strategies of teaching for different students.

Another factor that goes into teaching is the curriculum that teachers use. A curriculum cannot be something that stays the exact same over the years. With each year comes new challenges, knowledge and resources in the school system. Each class is different from the class the previous year. The schools are constantly getting new resources. Technology is constantly changing and providing more and different tools for teachers everyday. Therefore, curriculum will not be effective in this ever changing world if it has not changed in five or even two years. The world and education changes constantly and teachers have the responsibility to keep up with those changes and keep their students ahead of the pack and always involved in their learning.

Strategies of teaching are very important. A teacher must have a clear cut lesson plan and a reason for that lesson plan. I believe that the more you get your students actively involved in the lessons, the more likely they are going to want to learn and get something out of that lesson. As far as I have read on education, it seems that group learning and project based learning are the best methods. Projects are not just a reading and answering of questions. They make students think about what they are doing. Projects stimulate their minds and help them to understand the what, when, where, why and how of a subject.  

A classroom and its environment is a very important factor. The way students learn has a lot to do with the type of environment they learn in. They must be stimulated in every way possible. Put different facts up on the board or on the walls and change them constantly. This causes students to think and ask questions which is always a good thing. Put questions up on the bulletin board and give students extra incentive to answer those questions correctly. If a student has a stimulating and exciting environment, they will only be more in tuned with their school work.

Technology is an issue that every teacher today faces. There are two sides of the technology conversation, some good and some bad. However, it seems that the general consensus is that technology, when used right, is a good thing. Teachers have the responsibility to use technology in the right way and cannot just let the students use it freely with no purpose. Teachers must keep up to date on all the new technology in order to make it useful in their classrooms. Students like to know why they are learning what they are learning. Technology and using computers can give them a clear cut reason of why they are learning certain subjects while getting them actively involved in their work. Computer systems require students to pay attention and participate constantly. It also keeps students attention because most of these programs and softwares have graphics and use fun methods of learning.

----

I am a 2007 graduate of Churchland High School located in Portsmouth, VA, where I was born and raised. I have been babysitting and working with children for a few years now and I really enjoy it. I like to read and I have a major addiction to food and text messaging (at least 15,000 a month) and I love all types of music. I can be contacted at [swald004@odu.edu]. 


== '''WHY TEACHING???''' ==



----

In my opinion teaching can be a very rewarding experience if it what someone really wants to do. Passion should be the first characteristic of teaching. Teaching changes lives, therefore it requires major work and dedication that is often taken for granted. Effective teachers must enjoy what they do; they must be very understanding, firm, good observers, audience centered in terms of vocabulary and the content of what they say and most of all treat students with respect and never talk as if they are better than the students.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Rypka's Method==
Rypka's&lt;ref&gt;:Eugene Weston Rypka passed away on April 27, 2006. Gene was born on May 6, 1925 in Owatonna, MN to Charles Frederick and Ethel Marie Rypka. He served in World War II as a paramedic in Iwo Jima and received several medals and commendations. In 1958, Gene received a Ph.D. in Medical Microbiology from Stanford University. He had a long and distinguished career, including work with Russian scientists at Lovelace Medical Center and the University of New Mexico. Bicycle racing was a lifetime love and occupation, and in later years, he also studied martial arts.&lt;/ref&gt; method&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot;&gt;'''Primary reference:''' Biological Identification with Computers edited by R.J. Pankhurst, British museum (natural history) London, England proceedings of a meeting held at Kings College, Cambridge 27 and 28 September 1973 of the Systematics Association Special Volume Number 7 and published by the Academic Press 1975 noting the work of Eugene W. Rypka, Dept. of Microbiology, Lovelace Center for Health Sciences, Albuquerque, New Mexico, &quot;Pattern Recognition and Microbial Identification.&quot;  ISBN 0125448503&lt;/ref&gt; utilizes the [[Optimal_Classification#Theoretical_and_Empirical_Separatory_Equations|theoretical and empirical separatory equations]] shown below to perform the task of [[w:Optimization_(computer_science)|optimal]] [[w:Taxonomy|classification]]. The method finds the optimal order of the fewest attributes, which in combination define a '''bounded''' class of elements.

Application of the method begins with construction of an attribute-valued system in truth table&lt;ref&gt;[[Image:Truth_table_III.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt; or spreadsheet form with elements listed in the left most column beginning in the second row. Characteristics&lt;ref&gt;Characteristics and attributes are used interchangeably.&lt;/ref&gt; are listed in the first row beginning in the second column with the title of the attributes in the upper left most cell. Normally the file name of the data is given the title of the element class. The values which connect each characteristic with each element are placed in the intersecting cells. Selecting characteristics which all elements share may be the most difficult part of creating a database which can utilizing this method.
 
The elements are first sorted in [[Optimal_Classification#Order_of_elements|descending order]] according to their truth table value, which is calculated from the existing sequence and value of characteristics for each element. Duplicate truth table values or [[w:Multiset|multisets]] for the entire '''bounded''' class reveal either the need to eliminate duplicate elements or the need to include additional characteristics.

An empirical separatory value is calculated for each characteristic in the set and the characteristic with the greatest empirical separatory value is exchanged with the characteristic which occupies the most significant attribute position. 

Next the second most significant characteristic is found by calculating an empirical separatory value for each remaining characteristic in combination with the first characteristic. The characteristic which produces the greatest separatory value is then exchanged with the characteristic which occupies the second most significant attribute position.  

Next the third most significant characteristic is found by calculating an empirical separatory value for each remaining characteristic in combination with the first and second characteristics. The characteristic which produces the greatest empirical separatory value is then exchanged with the characteristic which occupies the third most significant attribute position. This procedure may continue until all characteristics have been processed or until one hundred percent separation of the elements has been achieved. 

A larger radix will allow faster identification by excluding a greater percentage of elements per characteristic. A binary radix for instance excludes only fifty percent of the elements per characteristic whereas a five-valued radix excludes eighty percent of the elements per characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;See Table II. page 158 of the '''primary reference'''&lt;/ref&gt;
What follows is an elucidation of the matrix and separatory equations.&lt;ref&gt;The '''primary reference''' should be consulted for a more detailed and in depth explanation of the method.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- ''(A flag identification example from [http://intsys.mgt.qub.ac.uk/notes/nnflags.html Neural Network Identification example.])'' --&gt;

Although the following example lacks an intuitive sense of optimization it serves as a good example of how optimization can reduce the number of queries. While the method of optimal classification is highly beneficial for reducing the number of queries required for manual identification, automated identification may be better served by use of a neural network.

===== Flag overlay grid =====
[[Image:Flag grid x.PNG|175x140px]]
&lt;div id=&quot;parts&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;''Designated '''areas''' (''characteristics'') for sampling background '''colors''' (''states'') of all '''flags''' (''elements'').''&lt;/big&gt;

The overlay is used to determine the color of each area for each flag and the color is recorded in the table as the logical state of the area. The table data is then submitted to the optimization program and processed until an optimal empirical separatory value is obtained.&lt;/div&gt;

===== Data set =====
 FLAGS/LOC,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I
 BELGIUM,BLACK,YELLOW,ORANGE,BLACK,YELLOW,ORANGE,BLACK,YELLOW,ORANGE
 FRANCE,BLUE,WHITE,RED,BLUE,WHITE,RED,BLUE,WHITE,RED
 GERMANY,BLACK,BLACK,BLACK,RED,RED,RED,YELLOW,YELLOW,YELLOW
 IRELAND,GREEN,WHITE,ORANGE,GREEN,WHITE,ORANGE,GREEN,WHITE,ORANGE
 ITALY,GREEN,WHITE,RED,GREEN,WHITE,RED,GREEN,WHITE,RED
 JAPAN,WHITE,WHITE,WHITE,WHITE,RED,WHITE,WHITE,WHITE,WHITE
 LUXEMBOURG,RED,RED,RED,WHITE,WHITE,WHITE,BABY,BABY,BABY
 NETHERLANDS,RED,RED,RED,WHITE,WHITE,WHITE,BLUE,BLUE,BLUE
 SPAIN,RED,RED,RED,YELLOW,YELLOW,YELLOW,RED,RED,RED
 HELIGOLAND,GREEN,GREEN,GREEN,RED,RED,RED,WHITE,WHITE,WHITE

===== Original order =====

[[image:Original_order_flag_example.JPG]]

===== Systematic query =====

Starting with area &quot;A&quot; the query begins by asking for the color in this area of the flag. Suppose we have in our possession the flag of the Netherlands. The answer to the first query in regard to area &quot;A&quot; is RED which would remove 2/3 of the flags from further consideration. The next query for the color in area &quot;B&quot; would be RED which would serve to eliminate none of the remaining flags. In fact, since the colors in columns &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are the same for each remaining flag, we would not be able to eliminate any remaining flags until column &quot;G&quot; where the color BLUE would provide a unique answer to the final necessary query. Here all remaining flags except the flag of the Netherlands would be eliminated from further consideration. It would therefore take a minimum of seven queries using the systematic query method to establish the identity of the flag in our possession as belonging to the Netherlands.

===== Optimized order =====

[[image:Optimized_order_flag_examplex.JPG]]

===== Minimized query =====

The results of optimization are shown above and include a listing of the theoretical and empirical percentages. The original characteristic sequence is indexed in the bottom row. Starting with area &quot;G&quot; the query begins by asking for the color in this area of the flag. Suppose we have in our possession the flag of Ireland. The answer to this first query would be GREEN. The next query is for the color in area &quot;F&quot; to which we would answer ORANGE. Since no other flags have this combination of GREEN and ORANGE in these areas our query can end here. The method has minimized the number of necessary queries required to identify the flag by optimizing the order of characteristics. (Please note that there may be more than one minimal solution.)

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''About Me'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



My name is Tanya Kirk and I am working toward my licensure certification for Pre-K through 6th grade.  I graduated in 2002 from UVA's College at Wise with a Bachelor's in Business Administration.  After working several years in the Business field, I decided that is not the path for me, so here I am back in college.

I am a proud mother of a three year old boy, Denim. He is the most important person in my life.  He has really changed my perspective of life.


&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;My Teaching Philosophy'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



Becoming a mother really opened my eyes and made me see the world in a different perspective.  I want my son to have the best education possible.  Therefore, I think that every teacher should teach their students as if it were their own son or daughter.  

Teachers have a huge responsibilty in teaching today's youth.  Not only do we have to teach reading, writing, and arthimetic, we also have to teach in way that each and every student can relate.  There are so many barriers in the classrooms today such as languages, disabilites, and even social barriers that teachers need to be prepared to deal with and be able to provide the best education.  Our children are our future and we need to get them ready for it.

Incorporating technology into the classrooms is essential in educating our youth.  Today's students use technology in their daily routines.  Providing them the chance to learn using technology helps them retain what they are learning.  I believe that teachers should use more in their teaching strategies than just lecturing because students need to be excited about what they are learning and using other approachse will help them be excited about learning.

[[User:Jlhogan22|Jlhogan22]] ([[User talk:Jlhogan22|talk]]) 00:28, 14 September 2008 (UTC) Hi, I truly enjoyed reading your page and seeing your pictures. I too have a bachelor's degree and have came back to obtain licensure to teach. I agree with your philosophy. It is up to us to be sure that our children are given a proper education. I also wanted to let you know that I admire anyone in college with a child. Being a mother is a difficult task on its own. Good luck to you!</text>

'''Whole wheat flour''' (also &quot;whole meal flour&quot;) is [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]] that is made from the entire wheat grain. This includes the endosperm, bran and germ.

===Fat content===

The germ being high in fat, whole wheat flour tends to go rancid (spoiling as butter does) faster than white flour. Keeping it refrigerated will delay this process. 

===Texture===

Baked goods cooked with whole wheat flour tend to be dark and dense compared to those cooked with white flour. The reason for this is that the particles of bran break up the strands of gluten, lessening their elasticity.

===Flavor=== 

Wheat flour has a strong flavor that can greatly change the food it is used in.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before you can start programming for the PSP, we need to download and install the PSP toolchain. The PSP toolchain is a set of program tools which helps us develop for the PSP. Since these program tools were developed on Linux, it can take a little more effort to make it work on Windows. If you are using Windows, you have two options: using [[../MinPSPW|MinPSPW]] which runs natively on Windows, or using [[../CYGWIN|CYGWIN]] which is a Linux emulator. The first option being the easier one. Or if you are running on Linux, you can compile it directly from [[../Linux|there]].

'''Note: Both CYGWIN and Linux will take a long time to compile everything, where as PSP Devkit is precompiled, meaning you won't have to wait to get started.'''

You will be asked what components to install (a choice from the main PSP DevKit, SDK Samples, PSP Link (a debugging program), and HTML doumentation) and where to install to. After installing the toolchain you may proceed to the next section.

'''Pastry flour''', like [[Cookbook:Cake Flour|cake flour]] is a weak or low gluten flour but is slightly stronger than the latter.  It does not have the whiteness of cake flour however, being more similar to the creamy colour of bread flour. It is used in good such as pie doughs, biscuits, scones, muffins and cookies.  It may be blended with bread flour in order to lighten it for some of the sweeter yeast doughs.

      <comment>/* Double Counting */ bigger math text</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">It might seem strange, but counting is one of the most difficult things in mathematics sometimes. In fact, it won't be far from the truth to call combinatorics the art of arranging objects and counting them. Brute force techniques, when objects are counted by enumerating all possibilities usually are doomed to fail in combinatorics and we are forced to rely on various techniques and mathematical ideas. Sometimes when even these ideas fail us we have to be content with establishing giving estimates or bounds of the objects to be counted.

==Double Counting==

In combinatorics, double counting, also called two-way counting, is a proof technique that involves counting the size of a set in two ways in order to show that the two resulting expressions for the size of the set are equal. We describe a finite set X from two perspectives leading to two distinct expressions. Through the two perspectives, we demonstrate that each is to equal |X|.

Let us look at two examples. The first is called the handshaking lemma and can be stated succinctly as: 
:At a convention the number of delegates who shake hands at odd number of times are even.

To see this, let &lt;math&gt;D_1,\cdots D_n&lt;/math&gt; be the delegates. Let &lt;math&gt;x_i\,&lt;/math&gt; be the number of times &lt;math&gt;D_i\,&lt;/math&gt; shakes hands and &lt;math&gt;y\,&lt;/math&gt; the number of handshakes that occur. Clearly the total number of handshake pairs, or the total number of times hands were extended is 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i&lt;/math&gt;. 
But counting another way it's just &lt;math&gt;2y\,&lt;/math&gt; for each handshake entitled two extended hands. So, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i=2y&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now how many odd &lt;math&gt;x_i\,&lt;/math&gt; can be there in the sum. If the number of odd &lt;math&gt;x_i\,&lt;/math&gt; was odd then their total must have been odd too (say 2''a''+1). This when added to the sum of the even &lt;math&gt;x_i\,&lt;/math&gt; (say 2''b'') would have given an odd number (2''a''+2''b''+1). But we just saw that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i&lt;/math&gt; was even. So the number of odd &lt;math&gt;x_i\,&lt;/math&gt; was even. But that's just another way of saying that the number of delegates who shook hands an odd number of times was even.

Let's take a look at another example. We want to derive the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers. Suppose we have an (''n'' + 1)&amp;times;(''n'' + 1) square of points. The number of points on the diagonal is exactly ''n'' + 1, and clearly the number of points ''S'' that are strictly above the diagonal equals the number of points strictly below the diagonal, so the total number of points in the square is ''n'' + 1 + 2''S''. On the other hand, the total number of points in the square is (''n'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;(n+1)^2 = n+1+2S\,&lt;/math&gt;,
thus
:&lt;math&gt;n(n+1) = 2S\,&lt;/math&gt;,
so
:&lt;math&gt;S = \sum_{k=1}^n{k} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Order of elements ===

The elements are arranged in descending order according to their truth table value, i.e., the value calculated as the sum of each characteristic's logic state value times the highest value of logic raised to the power of the order of the characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cstc.org/data/resources/60/convexp.html Number Systems] - essentially using the characteristic values to compute a network or memory address, followed by sorting.&lt;/ref&gt; The element [[w:Positional notation|truth table value]] allows elements to be sorted and identified as unique or equivalent and the '''bounded''' class identified as a [[w:Set|set]] or [[w:Multiset|multiset]].

: &lt;math&gt; e_i = \sum_{j=0}^C \left[v_{i,j} V^{(C-j)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;, where:

::*'''''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the element truth table value in the group,
::*'''''V''''' is the highest value of logic in the group,
::*'''''v''''' is the value of logic of each characteristic in the group,
::*'''''j''''' is the '''''jth''''' characteristic index, where:

:::'''''j = 0..C''''' and where:
::::*'''''C'''''  is the number of characteristics in the group, 

::*'''''i''''' is the '''''ith''''' element index, where:

:::'''''i = 0..G''''' and where:
::::*'''''G'''''  is the number of elements in the '''bounded''' class.

=== Maximum number of pairs of elements to separate ===

Maximum number of pairs of elements to separate refers to [[w:Triangular matrix|triangularization]] of the matrix to permit comparison of each element with every other element to determine the number of pairs that are separable or disjoint. Pairs are separable or disjoint whenever the logic values of the elements that make up a pair are different. In theory, therefore the maximum possible number of pairs that can be separated is determined by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;See page 176 Table XI of the '''primary reference'''.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
: &lt;math&gt; p_{max} = \frac{\left[{G (G-1)}\right]}{2} &lt;/math&gt;, where:&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Triangular number|Triangular Number]]&lt;/ref&gt;

::*'''''p&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the maximum number of pairs to separate, and
::*'''''G''''' is the number of elements in the '''bounded''' class.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let us now try to count subsets of a given set. We will call a set of order n if it contains n elements. 

The first result that we will establish concerns the total number of subsets that a given set of order n can have. We claim that it is &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;. To see this first take a set X of n elements and a subset Y of it. Now consider the following function:
:&lt;math&gt;f_Y(n) = 
\begin{cases} 
  1,\ n\in Y \\
  0,\ n\notin Y   
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Such a function is called an indicator function. If &lt;math&gt;X=\{0,1\cdots n-1\}&lt;/math&gt; then we can represent the above function by the n-tuple &lt;math&gt;(f(0),f(1)\cdots f(n-1))&lt;/math&gt;. This n-tuple is a sufficient description of Y. By looking at the n-tuple one can easily deduce Y, the positions corresponding to 1 are its members. Conversely given Y one can always construct this n-tuple. So each subset corresponds with exactly one n-tuple. 

Now regard this n-tuple as a base 2 integer
:&lt;math&gt;N=f(n-1)2^{n-1}+f(n-2)2^{n-2}\cdots f(1)2+f(0)&lt;/math&gt;.
Each n-tuple corresponds to a unique integer (since the coefficients of each n-tuple are unique) and so to a unique subset of X. The smallest i.e. 0, corresponds to the n-tuple of zeros which in turn corresponds with the empty set, the largest i.e. &lt;math&gt;2^{n-1}+2^{n-2}\cdots 2+1=2^{n}-1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the n-tuple of ones which in turn corresponds to X. There are &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; such integers between 0 and &lt;math&gt;2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; (including 0 and &lt;math&gt;2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;) and so there are &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; subsets possible for X.

Let us now turn our attention to binomial coefficents. Given a non-negative integer ''n'' and an integer ''k'', the binomial coefficient is defined to be the natural number

:&lt;math&gt;
  {n \choose k} = \frac{n \cdot (n-1) \cdots (n-k+1)}
  {k \cdot (k-1) \cdots 1} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \quad \mbox{if}\ 0\leq k\leq n \qquad (1) &lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} = 0 \quad \mbox{if } k &lt; 0 \mbox{ or } k&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''! denotes the factorial of ''n''.   

&lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}&lt;/math&gt; is read as ''n choose k''.

The most important result concerning binomial coefficients is as follows:

:''Theorem'':Let X be an n-order set. Then the number of its k-order subsets is &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;X=\{1,2\cdots n\}&lt;/math&gt;. These numbers may be listed in various orders, called permutations. There are n! of these permutations because the first term may be any of the n numbers, the second any of the remaining n-1 numbers and so on. 

Let us count these permutations in a different way now. Then we shall apply double counting as described in the previous chapter.

Let Y be a subset of X having k elements. Then there are k! permutations of the elements of Y. Similarly there are (n-k)! permutations of the elements not in Y. If we attach any one of these (n-k)! permutations to the right end of any one of the k! previous permutations, the ordered sequence of n elements thus obtained is one of the permutations of X. To get all the permutations of X we repeat the procedure with Y replaced by each of the k-order subsets. Thus the total possible permutations would be T.k!(n-k)! where T is the number of k-order subsets. That is because total permutations = adding k!(n-k)! the number of times equal to the number of k-order subsets = T.k!(n-k)!. Now this number must be equal to n! and so we have T = The number of k-order subsets of X = &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n\choose k}&lt;/math&gt;. Q.E.D.     

The above proof guarantees that &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}&lt;/math&gt; is an natural number, for the simple reason that it represents the number of ways of selecting a k-order subset out of an n-order subset. Usually whenever we have n choices and k have to be chosen we declare that the number of ways of doing this are &lt;math&gt;{n\choose k}&lt;/math&gt;. At that instance we are actually drawing a parallel between the choices and the elements of the n-order set.

The discussion here would remain incomplete if we do not put a note about Pascal's triangle here. 

Pascal's rule is the important relation
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose k} +  {n \choose k+1} = {n+1 \choose k+1}, \qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;
which follows directly from the definition:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} {n \choose k} + {n \choose k+1} 
 &amp;{}= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} + \frac{n!}{(k+1)!(n-(k+1))!} \\
 &amp;{} = \left(\frac{n!(k+1)}{k!(n-k)!(k+1)} + \frac{n!(n-k)}{(k+1)!(n-(k+1))!(n-k)}\right)\\
 &amp;{} = \left(\frac{n!(k+1 + n-k)}{(k+1)!(n-k)!}\right) \\
 &amp;{} = \frac{(n+1)!}{(k+1)!((n+1)-(k+1))!} \\
 &amp;{} = {n+1 \choose k+1}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Pascal's rule gives rise to Pascal's triangle:
:{|
|-
|0: || || || || || || || || ||1|| || || || || || || || 
|-
|1: || || || || || || || ||1|| ||1|| || || || || || ||

|-
|8: ||1&amp;nbsp;|| ||8&amp;nbsp;|| ||28|| ||56|| ||70|| ||56|| ||28|| ||8&amp;nbsp;|| ||1&amp;nbsp;
|} &lt;!--There is a wider cell made with &amp;nbsp; in 1-digit columns, so triangle becomes more graphically symmetrical --&gt;

Row number ''n'' contains the numbers C(''n'', ''k'') for ''k'' = 0,…,''n''. It is constructed by starting with ones at the outside and then always adding two adjacent numbers and writing the sum directly underneath. This method allows the quick calculation of binomial coefficients without the need for fractions or multiplications. For instance, by looking at row number 5 of the triangle, one can quickly read off that &lt;math&gt;{5\choose 0}=1,\ {5\choose 1}=5\ {5\choose 2}=10 &lt;/math&gt; etc. This is because of Pascal's relation proved above.

The differences between elements on other diagonals are the elements in the previous diagonal, as a consequence of Pascal's relation above.

=Levitsky Attack or Queen's Bishop Attack=
===2. Bg5===
Bg5 is an immediate attack by white, in hopes of slowing black's development via pinning the pawn on e7. This position can be negated by black developing Nf6, or a pawn move f6. usually, the bishop cannot remain in its position for long, necessitating a loss of tempo.

The tables on this page are intended for those who need a Wikitext table that they can modify or extend for their use.   For the main table-making page refer to [[../Tables/|Tables]].  

The tables are accompanied by both Wikitext and HTML code modules in a drop-box, and this code can be copied into the WikiBooks [[wikibooks:sandbox|Sandbox]] for additional work.   The code in these modules has been numbered though the line numbers are local and will not appear in your pasted copies.

[http://www.uni-bonn.de/~manfear/html2wiki-tables.php#wiki '''Convert HTML Tables to Wiki'''] is an excellent online tool, though a tool for the reverse process is elusive.   Consequently, if both HTML and Wiki versions of tables are needed, it is advised to make tables first in HTML, then convert.   Contributors with a useful table are encouraged to add to the page.|trailer=&lt;h3&gt;The Basic Table&lt;/h3&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, my name is Lanisha (username: lland001), and I currently reside in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia.  I graduated from Old Dominion University seven years ago with a B.A. in Theatre and Dance with a Dance Concentration, and a minor in Community Health.  I have currently re-enrolled into the University seeking my second undergraduate degree in Dance Education since it was not available when I attended seven years ago.  I am also a new full-time Dance teacher at a local High School.  In addition to being a full-time teacher and student, I am also a full-time Dance Instructor at a dance studio, work with two seperate competition teams, am a Nationally Licensed and Certified Massage Therapist, and last but not least, a licensed Esthetician.  

My educational philosophy is that every student should learn and have a right to a decent and thorough education.  I believe students should be taught in ways that best suits their learning abilities without holding them back from the lessons they need to succeed in life.  These lessons would include: lectures, group assignments and activities, collaboration with other teachers to incorporate other ways of learning information, constant student interaction, etc.  I believe that a well-planned curriculum/lesson plan is very important because it helps organize the class information.  A clean, well-organized environment is essential because I feel that when teachers are organized it creates a comfortable working environment for the students.  In addition to needing a comfortable working environment, it helps students with organizational skills which are necessary in the &quot;real world&quot;.  Allowing students to share their views in various ways to help them learn and grow into young adults I find very effective.  It not only allows the students to converse as a whole, but it gives them each an individual voice which is extremelely important for their social and academic developement.  In closing, a motivated teacher is very important.  If the teacher is not passionate about what he/she is teaching, I do not believe that there is any way the teacher can motivate a student learn.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is P-akka Reid. I live in the small city of Lynchburg, Virginia. I attend the ODU Classes through the Teletechnet Program and it is getting harder and harder for me especially since I cannot recieve DSL internet at my home. I am currently a Teachers Assistant at a Daycare and loving the experience I recieve daily. I am currently studying Education I recieved an Associates degree from Central Virginia Community College and now planning to obtain my Bachelors degree from ODU in Education.

My Educational Philosphy is that of I believe that teachers must be pragmatic about the quality of their work, rather than trying to make sure that it reflects their philosophy of it. That is to say, teaching should be based on what the relevant empirical evidence indicates is the most cost- and time-effective way to develop students’ academic skills and knowledge.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navlist/Top}}

== Phonotactics ==

Phonemes don't just randomly combine to make a language.  They have to be arranged according to certain rules.  For example, if you take the phonemes out of &quot;complexity&quot; and rearrange these randomly, you don't get an English word:

 /k@mplEksIti/ &lt;complexity&gt;
 /ksIlmp@kitE/ (approximately pronounced &quot;kuh-silm-puck-eat-eh&quot;)

So what is phonotactics? Basically, it tells you what sounds can go where, and what sounds can't. In English, for example, a word can begin with spl- (split, splash), and spr- (spray, spread), but not slr- or srl-, or slp- or srp-. That's just how it works in English. On the other hand, words in Russian can begin with vstr- and dn-, which you wouldn't be seeing any time soon in English. Words in Japanese, on the other hand, can't begin with spr- or spl- or even sp-; it has to begin with a single consonant, or none at all. (When Japanese people pronounce &quot;splash&quot;, they tend to say &quot;suh-puh-la-shuh&quot; /{{CXS|s@p@l&amp;S@}}/ — For comparison, try pronouncing the Ukrainian city of &quot;Dnipropetrovs'k&quot;.)

=== Syllable Structure ===

So how would you make these constraints up for your conlang? Well, the earlier section on syllables can help. Start by dividing your conlang's phonemes into different categories and then defining which categories can combine with others in what ways inside a syllable.

For instance, [[w:Toki Pona|Toki Pona]] defines its allowed syllables as V or CV(n), where C is any consonant and V is any vowel; &quot;n&quot; represents itself /{{CXS|n}}/; and the parentheses mean &quot;optional&quot;.  So syllables like /{{CXS|sen}}/ and /{{CXS|jo}}/ are allowed in Toki Pona, but /{{CXS|stan}}/ and /{{CXS|pit}}/ are not.  Konya allows C(S)V(N), where S is a semivowel (/{{CXS|j}}/ or /{{CXS|w}}/) and N is a nasal (/{{CXS|m}}/ or /{{CXS|n}}/).  Vorlin allowed syllables of the form C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;VC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is any consonants in Vorlin except /{{CXS|N}}/ and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is any consonant in Vorlin except /{{CXS|h}}/.

How would you create your own syllable structure? By selecting what sounds can occur in the onset, nucleus, and coda of a syllable (remember back to the section on syllables). You will notice that all the examples above have V (any vowel) as their nucleus and that it's never in brackets (and thus not optional).

=== Viable consonant clusters ===

Another way to specify phonotactics is to make a list of all consonant clusters that are allowed and then, by implication, you should know which consonant clusters can't appear in your language.  For example, in the conlang [[w:Quenya|Quenya]], the consonant clusters /{{CXS|mb}}/, /{{CXS|nt}}/, and /{{CXS|lm}}/ are allowed, but the consonant clusters /{{CXS|pn}}/, /{{CXS|rl}}/, and /{{CXS|ln}}/ aren't.

Of course, these two ways to describe phonotactics are not mutually exclusive; one can perfectly state that, given the restrictions of syllabical structure, there are certain clusters that don't happen and other that do.

      <comment>/* Components of a syllable */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navlist/Top}}

'''Syllables''' are the basic unit of sound that you can sound out.  This is because they have a ''peak'' — something that you can draw out.  For example, the one-syllable word &lt;tap&gt; has a peak that you can draw out (the sound of the &quot;a&quot;, /{{CXS|&amp;}}/).  This drawn out sound is usually a vowel in English, but some consonants can also take up the role; American English often has no vowel in the last syllable of words like &lt;little&gt; and &lt;rural&gt;, the final /{{CXS|l}}/ acts as a syllable all by itself.

It's probably of no surprise that people all around the world use the syllable as a fundamental unit in both poetry and song:

 There once was an old man of Esser,
 Whose knowledge grew lesser and lesser,
 
 There - once - was   - an   - old - man - of  - Es  - ser, (9 syllables)
 Whose - know - ledge - grew - les - ser - and - les - ser, (also 9 syllables)

== Components of a syllable ==

Syllables aren't just a jumble of sounds that happen to have a peak.  As we have already seen, only some phonemes can be the peak in any given language.  This is called the '''nucleus''' of the syllable.  Everything in the syllable that comes before the nucleus is called the '''onset''' and everything after it is called the '''coda'''.  For example, let's take the English one syllable word &lt;once&gt; and determine its nucleus, onset, and coda.  First break the word down into its component phonemes.

 /w/ /v/ /n/ /s/

Now the nucleus of the syllable must be the vowel, /{{CXS|v}}/; the onset is everything before that, /{{CXS|w}}/; and the coda must be /{{CXS|ns}}/.  Syllables don't have to have an onset or a coda, so that the nucleus could be the whole syllable.

== Stress and Tone ==

In most languages, you will find that certain syllables inside a word are &quot;stressed&quot; more than others. This is something you will need to consider for your conlang. English stress is mostly unpredictable, and isn't indicated anywhere in the orthography. When you create your own language, however, you will need either rules of stress that are absolutely regular or a simple way of indicating it when you write your language down.

How should stress be determined? There are many ways you can do that. A very simple way would be to always place stress on a specific syllable: Esperanto, for example, always stresses the penultimate. Another idea is to stress different syllables depending on the phonemes each syllable uses: Latin stresses the penultimate except when both final syllables have short vowels that have no more than a single consonant between them.

The possibilities don't stop there, either.  Perhaps stress could be based on the relative &quot;weight&quot; of different phonemes in different places, such as in Spanish: stress the last syllable if that syllable ends with a consonant (except &quot;n&quot;, &quot;s&quot;), unless noted otherwise in the orthography.  Or you could get rid of the stress distinction altogether, as French has, and instead stress certain ''words'' more than others.  (French actually stresses the last syllable of phrases, rather than individual words.)

Finally, you could always try using tone instead of stress, but unless your native language is tonal as well you could have a lot of difficulty here.  A tonal language distinguishes syllables based on their pitch; for example &quot;high pitch,&quot; &quot;extra-low pitch,&quot; &quot;low rising pitch&quot; (which starts low before gradually rising), and various others.  You can even have &quot;high rising,&quot; &quot;rising-falling,&quot; or &quot;creaky voice&quot; — in which case the tone is so low the individual vibrations of the vocal chords can be heard.  We'd recommend you to examine one or more tonal languages, such as Mandarin Chinese or Vietnamese, and discern the ways those languages make use of it before trying it yourself.

Of course, all of the above refers merely to the stress and tone of individual syllables within a word; if your language isn't tonal, you should also consider the use of stress over entire sentences, though you needn't make it very complicated. English, for example, tends to stress nouns and verbs over prepositions, except when making a point. It also tends to add a slightly higher tone at the end of questions than in statements. (As seen in &quot;This is a sentence&quot; versus &quot;This is a ''sentence''?&quot;) You can ignore this sort of thing altogether, or you can make rules of your own.

'''Self-rising flour''' is an all-purpose flour that has a leavening agent such as baking soda or baking powder already blended in. Self-rising flour is not used by professional bakers but can be useful in the home.

To make self-rising flour (scale quantities as desired):

Yield: 1 cup

==Ingredients==
* 1 cup flour
* 1½ tsp. baking-powder
* ½ tsp.  salt

==Procedure==
# Mix to combine.
# Store in an air-tight container in a cool, dry environment.

==Notes==
* Do not salt recipes calling for it if using self-rising flour as a substitute.

==Who is this?==
Thomas Jefferson

==What did he do that made him important?==
Thomas Jefferson was the third President of the United States.  He was President from 1801–1809.  He was Secretary of State under [[Wikijunior:American Founding Fathers/George Washington|George Washington]], and Vice President for [[Wikijunior:American Founding Fathers/John Adams|John Adams]] when he was elected President.

He attended the Second Continental Congress, and was the primary author of the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (which the Second Continental Congress decided to write).

==What did he do when he was young?==
Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743 in Virginia, the third of eight children. In 1752, Jefferson began attending a local school run by William Douglas, a Scottish minister. At the age of nine, Jefferson began studying Latin, Greek, and French. In 1757, when he was 14 years old, his father died. Jefferson inherited about 5,000 acres (20 km²) of land and dozens of slaves. He built his home there, which eventually became known as Monticello.

After his father's death, he was taught at the school of the learned minister James Maury from 1758 to 1760. In 1760 Jefferson entered The College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg at the age of 16; he studied there for two years, graduating with highest honors in 1762.
 
==What did he do afterward?==
Jefferson died on the Fourth of July, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. He died a few hours before the death of John Adams, his compatriot in their quest for independence, then great political rival, and later friend and correspondent. Adams is often rumored to have referenced Jefferson in his last words, unaware of his passing.

Although he was born into one of the wealthiest families in the United States, Thomas Jefferson was deeply in debt when he died. His possessions were sold at auction.

==How do we remember him today?==
Thomas Jefferson is probably best known for being the author of the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence.]] Jefferson is also well known for being a statesman, architect, archaeologist, paleontologist, author, inventor and founder of the University of Virginia.
His image appears on the US Nickel, with his home Monticello appearing on the back.  His image also adorns the Two Dollar Bill, and there is a memorial building honoring him in Washington DC.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am Pauline Thorson, a wife and mother and now get to have the title student as well. I am returning to school after taking time off from school. During my break I got married to my husband Paul and traveled through the Military to Guam. Before leaving for Guam in 2000, I had my first kid, Paul Jr., now 8 and in third grade. Then, Timothy, who was born in Guam, is now 6 and excited about being a first grader. I finally returned to school when I was able to get both kids in school. This past year I have been quite busy. I have obtained my Associates Degree from Tidewater Community College. My husband missed the graduation because he was doing his part with the Navy and was out to sea for about the first 6 months of the year. We also have two dogs and if nothing else is keeping me busy then they want something.

Not sure if this is my philosophy but here is how and why I wish to become a High School Biology Teacher.

When I was in High school I remember that, for some reason that was the years that science started to make sense to me. I then went on to College, first attempt wasn't pretty as I was young and naive, where I often heard that I was good and even great about breaking down things so they were easy to understand for fellow classmates. So about the time my kids were starting to go to school I thought about what I really wanted to do and after putting the previous thoughts together I made the decision to become a Biology teacher.

To me a good teacher is someone who can keep the material interesting and tries to make sure everyone in the class is grasping the concepts taught. I also believe that a bad teacher is someone who just runs through the material and either does not care how you do or gives the impression of this. The first teacher is usually approachable on any subject and the other would not be. I have had both kinds of teachers and think that my science teachers in high school were the caring type who made sure everyone grasped the subject. I only wonder what would of happen if my English teacher was that way, being I am not the enthusiastic writer. I just try to get my thoughts out as best as I can and try not to make too many mistakes along the way. And, in the future I hope to inspire at least one young person to become interested in the sciences and not to just go through life not knowing how things live, grow and thrive. If they do not like the idea of studying living things then maybe I could point them in the direction of the many other areas of science.</text>

==Who is this?==
John Adams

==What did he do that made him important?==
===Boston Massacare===
After the Boston Massacre, when British soldiers fired onto a mob of colonists, John Adams chose to be the lawyer of the British soldiers.  He was able to convince the jury that 6 of the 8 soldiers were not guilty.

===Congress===
Massachusetts sent John Adams to the first and second Continental Congresses in 1774 and from 1775 to 1778. In June 1775, he nominated George Washington of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the army then assembled around Boston. His influence in Congress was great, and almost from the beginning, he wanted the United States to have a permanent separation from Britain.

===Presidency===
John Adams was the second president of the United States. He was elected President after serving as America's first Vice President from 1789–1797 for two terms. He opponents in his race for the presidential election were [[Wikijunior:American Founding Fathers/Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Wikijunior:American Founding Fathers/Thomas Pinckney|Thomas Pinckney]].

John Adams was selected to be a part of a committee with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman to make a draft of the [[Wikijunior:United States Charters of Freedom/Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.  As a representative of Congress in Europe, he was a major negotiator of the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain.

In 1777, Adams resigned his seat on the Massachusetts Superior Court to serve as the head of the Board of War and Ordnance, as well as many other important committees.

==What did he do when he was young?==
John Adams was born on October 30, 1735 in Massachusetts. Adams went to Harvard College at age sixteen.His father wanted him to become a minister, but Adams hadn't figured out what he wanted to be yet. After graduating in 1755, he taught school for a few years in Worcester and then decided to become a lawyer and studied law in the office of James Putnam, a prominent lawyer in Worcester.

From an early age, he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men which are scattered through his diary. He put the skill to good use as a lawyer, often recording cases he observed so that he could study and reflect upon them. 

In 1764, Adams married Abigail Smith and had six children with her, one of them being future president John Quincy Adams.
Adams was not a popular leader like his second cousin, Samuel Adams. Instead, his got followeres through his work as a constitutional lawyer.

==What did he do afterward?==
After Adams was defeated for reelection by Thomas Jefferson, he retired to Massachusetts. He and his wife Abigail Adams founded an accomplished family line of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family. His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as other Founders'.

==How do we remember him today?==
The John Adams television show, and George Washington (John was the one to nominate him as Commander in Chief).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

The '''mixing''' of ingredients is an important step in cooking. The techniques used in combining ingredients greatly influences the quality of the final product. Nowhere in cooking is this more evident than in baking but it is equally important in such procedures as [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce making]] where emulsification, the incorporation of hot liquid and starch, the mounting of a sauce with butter, etc. are special skills which must be mastered by every cook. In baking such procedures as the folding of egg whites or whipped cream into cake batter, mousses and moulds is another special skill.  The mixing of batters in general is a science in itself and so on.</text>

The term '''Mix''' in cooking may refer to:


# The technique of [[Cookbook:Mixing|mixing]].
# A prepackaged or preprepared mixture of ingredients, often commercially manufactured and sold in boxes or jars, such as cake mixes, or prepared in the home for convenience such as [[Cookbook:Mixed Spice|spice mixtures]], etc.

      <comment>sentence structure</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You've made an animation, but it's improtant to ensure it looks correct in-game.
*In the ''default'' folder, find ''mdldecompiler.qc'' and copy and paste it to the ''tocompile'' folder.
*Replace the first line in the new mdldecompiler.qc with this:
 $cd &quot;.\&quot;
This tells the compiler to look in the current directory for the SMD files.
{{NOTE|The idle animation is not as long as the other animations. For this reason you will need to temporarily adjust the timing of the sounds so they do not play at a nonexistent frame.}}
==Adjusting the Timing of the Sounds==
*Find a line that begins like this:
 { event 5004
*After ''5004'' you will see a number. Change the number to a number from 0 to 15 for each line. A number from 0 to 15 is used because the idle animation goes from frame 0 to frame 15. 
*Save the QC file. Do not close it yet.

==Copying and Pasting Animations==
*Count how many times ''$sequence'' is typed in QC file.
*Subtract one (for the idle animation.)
*Copy and paste idle.smd that many times.
*Rename the SMD files to whatever word comes after ''$sequence'' in the QC file. (e.g. shoot1, reload, draw)
*Save the QC file. Do not close it yet.

==Converting the Textures to Targa Format==
*If your textures are already in TGA format skip this.
*Open IrfanView.
*Open each texture.
*Go to File&gt;Save as and save as a Targa (.TGA) file.
*Put these Targa files in a folder called ''lr300''. 
{{NOTE|If you are animating a different weapon make the folder name meaningful.}}
*Make a ''.bat'' (text) file with the following code:
 cd %sourcesdk%
 cd ..\
 cd .\counter-strike source\cstrike\materials\models\weapons\v_models\
 start .\
{{Warning|The batch file will not work if these folders are not created. If this is the case, remove the second and third lines of code from the batch file. Now with the new window open, go up one folder. Create more folders in the following hierarchy: *username*(folder that you are at)\counter-strike source\cstrike\materials\models\weapons\v_models\ If you did this correctly the batch file with all four lines of code will work.}}
*Execute the batch file. Now you will see your materials folder for first person view models. Keep this folder open for later.

==Converting the Textures to VTF Format==
*Find vtex.exe. Is located in %sourcesdk%\bin\ep1\bin\
*Make a new text file somewhere (with .bat at the end) and write the complete location of vtex.exe in quotes in the first line of the batch file. Now edit it is similarly to the following:
 cd .\
 &quot;C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\username\sourcesdk\bin\ep1\bin\vtex.exe&quot; -shader VertexLitGeneric .\*.tga
*Save it in the ''lr300'' folder.
*Move the ''lr300'' folder to
 \your username\sourcesdk_content\cstrike\materialsrc\models\weapons\v_models\
*Double click the batch file and the window opened earlier should have a folder called ''lr300'' with the textures and VMT files in it.

==Finalizing the QC==
*Open the QC file if it is not open already.
*Find all of the lines that begin with ''$hbox''. Delete them.
*There should still be a line that says $hboxset &quot;default&quot;. Keep it. This lets the engine compile the hitboxes for you.
*Find a line beginning with
 $model &quot;studio&quot; &quot;[something].smd&quot;
*Rename [something].smd to the gun's smd file.
*Add a line after this line
 $cdmaterials &quot;models\weapons\v_models\hands\&quot;
with the following text:
 $cdmaterials &quot;models\weapons\v_models\lr300\&quot;
*\lr300\ should be replaced with whatever folder name you gave the materials earlier.
*Find all lines that begin with ''$attachment''.
*Replace the phrase in quotes (in the ''$attachment'' lines) with the name of the bone of the weapon. (In this tutorial it would be ''ValveBiped.Frame''.)
{{Info|The ''$attachment'' lines are for the muzzle flash and shell ejection.}}
*Save the QC and close it.
*Right click the QC and click Compile.
*The QC should compile successfully.
{{XWarning|The QC may not compile successfully. Check any errors studiomdl.exe gives you and post them on the talk page for help.}}

==Testing Animations in the Game==
*Open Counter-Strike Source
*Create a server.
*Buy the weapon you are animating to test it.
*There are smoothing errors in certain lighting conditions; we will fix those later.
*Turn on cheats using the console command ''sv_cheats 1''.
*Here are a few cheats you can play with:
**''cl_drawhud 0'' - disables HUD, good for recording videos and taking pictures
**''give weapon_sg552'' - give a weapon. sg552 can be replaced with other weapon names
**''impulse 101'' - refill ammo and money
*Take some pictures by pressing F5. The pictures will end up in cstrike\screenshots\map_name####.jpg
*Share these pictures and get some feedback! The idle animation should be perfected before starting any other animation.

==Adjusting the Origin of the Animations==
*You can make a minor adjustment to the  model without editing the SMD files. It is called setting the origin.
*To do this, open your QC file.
*After the $cd line, add a new line.
*Enter the following:
 $origin x y z
*Replace x y and z with numbers that depend on which way you want the model to be offset.
*Refer to this picture to see how origins work. [http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/7876/cssoriginsnx0.gif Changing Origins]
{{Warning|The camera in XSI will be incorrect now. To fix this, unhide the camera. Move it to half way of each axis done on the origin. (e.g. If you put $origin 0 3 0, Translate the camera on the y axis 1.5 units. Set a key for this new position (K).}}

----
Hi!  My name is Kimberly and currently I live in Smithfield with my husband and two cats.  I received my BSBA and MBA from Old Dominion University.  In a prior life, I was a financial analyst for six years before going into the education field.  I decided that having a bigger paycheck was not the most important thing.  I wanted my work to make a difference.  After my first year of teaching I can honestly tell you that teaching can be the most rewarding experience.  I currently teach Business Education at Nansemond River High School.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0080&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
----
My educational philosophy is based on progressivism and differentiated instruction.  I believe instructional lessons should involve problem solving and group activities.   Differentiated instruction should be implemented as much as possible into lessons.  Student involvement and instructional variation aids student learning.  Students’ learning styles vary widely:  visual, physical, etc.  It is important to utilize differentiated instructions since all teachers will have students with different learning styles combined in one classroom.
I also believe in a positive classroom environment.  This type of environment encourages student interaction and response.  I believe that a positive environment leads to better comprehension and retention of subject material.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''About Me:'''

Hey Everyone. My name is Jennifer and I attend ODU via ODU-Richmond. I am almost 20 years old, and have just started my third year. My major is Elementary Education (PK-6). I am still unsure of what grade level I would like to teach, however I hope to be closer to a decision by the end of my observations. I have a puppy named Bella who takes up most of my free-time, either by providing me with chewed up toilet paper to clean up or begging me to throw the ball for her. She is a cocker spaniel and is seriously the most adorable puppy ever (of course in my opinion!). I am an only child, however we have a large &quot;family&quot;. Besides Bella, we have one other dog [Nala], four cats [Peaches, Callie, Winnie, Kitty], and 2 angel fish [sadly, they are un-named]. Other things I enjoy doing are spending time with my loved ones [especially Mom and my boyfriend, Jeff], going shopping [I am crazy about shoes &amp; purses!!!], dressing up just for fun, spending time with the little ones of the family, and of course sleeping late whenever my schedule allows me to..haha. I may seem like a complete girly-girl, however I love doing anything outdoors. I love to go fishing with my pink fishing pole (go ahead, laugh..but I SWEAR it's true!). I love to go camping. And, if someone would take me, I want to go hunting! I am going to end this with my favorite quote ever: &quot;I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go. Things go wrong so you can appreciate them when they are right. You believe less so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself. And sometimes, good things fall apart so better things can fall together&quot; -Unknown.

'''Favorites:'''
*Color* - Pink
*Movie* - The Notebook
*Author* - Jodi Picoult, Nicholas Sparks &amp; Sarah Dessen
*Sports Team* - Dallas Cowboys fan 'til I die :)
*Food* - Mac &amp; Cheese

'''My Teaching Philosophy:'''

Ever since I can remember I have always wanted to be a teacher. Though I never knew specifically what kind of teacher I wanted to be, someday it just dawned on me how wonderful of an Elementary Ed teacher I'd be. Though I do not know exactly what my &quot;philosophy&quot; would be, I have a good idea of what I envision my classroom to be like. Though it was not that long ago, I look back in the classrooms that I was taught in as a young child. I remember what did and did not work for me. I envision my classroom being a place for my students to thrive. I will encourage team-work because I feel as if &quot;together, all things are possible&quot;. I will encourage creativity. I will never discourage an idea or thought, but will however thrive on every idea or thought brought to my attention. I will integrate technology into my classroom as much as I possibly can. I believe it is important for &quot;no child to be left behind&quot;. With that being said, I will work to the best of my ability to know that all of my students are receiving equal education and proper interventions when needed. I will encourage class discussions. I think it is essential that we not only share our thoughts and opinions, but allow ourselves to learn from the thoughts and opinions of our peers. I will challenge my students in every way possible, but avoid making them feel discouraged. I also believe in integrating thought process and problem-solving techniques into my classroom are extremely essential. Not only will they learn how to deal with common classroom problems, but will learn to deal with issues outside of our classroom as well. I believe by implementing all of these things into my classroom will encourage students to thrive for success inside, outside, and beyond our classroom.

== Author Response ==

That's cool that you enjoy motorcycling. I've been looking to get into it as well but my girlfriend won't let me. I think i'll try a scooter instead. I agree with your statement that each child is special. Every child is unique in their own way and in that, each child learns differently as well. Your philosophy of making the learning experience fun coincides with my own educational philosophy of making learning enjoyable. In regards to keeping students motivated, by making each lesson plan an enjoyable experience the students will then look forward to going to class and therefore WANT to learn.[[User:Jferi002|Jferi002]] ([[User talk:Jferi002|talk]]) 18:18, 14 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Hi! My name is Maryanne Summerford!''' 

'''About Me!'''
I am a Sophomore at ODU and I am majoring in Elementary Education K-3. I am from Yorktown, Virginia. I grew up in a small town, so moving to the city of Norfolk has been a challenge for me. I graduated from Grafton High School and ever since I was young, I always knew I wanted to be a teacher. I was a foreign exchange student to Germany and other countries in Europe when I was in highschool so I was able to see how different students around the world learn. In 2007, my father passed away of cancer, so I have been trying to get involved with cancer research. I enjoy spending time with my family and friends[[:Image:]]. After I graduate I would like to travel and see as much of the world as I can before starting my career.   



'''My Philosophy on Education:'''   
I was raised in a broken home. My parents divorced when I was 11 and I lived with my mom and two sisters. I understand I can't help everyone, but if I can help a child like the way some of my teachers helped me than all of my hard work and effort will be worth it. I believe every child should have the same opportunities, no matter what race, social class, or gender. I hope to eventually work more with children in foster care. 

 

'''Instructional Strategies'''I believe teachers should be gifted to teach students of all different learning styles. I hope to bring in art and text to my classroom. I find hands on activities allows students to understand the topic better and hope to make the course more fun. 

'''Classroom Environment:'''  I picture my classroom to be full of color. I want every inch of the walls to be covered in art work and projects the students created. Every student should feel rewarded for what they have done. They should feel proud of the things they will accomplish. 

'''Technology:'''  Since I grew up on computers, I am sure my future students will too. No one knows what the future holds though, but I hope to be able to teach my students to use the most up to date technology there is to offer. 


'''Assessment:'''  At the start of the school year, students will be tested to see what levels of learning they are at. That way I will know how to teach each individual student. Through out the year they will be given different graded assignments, but for the most part I will go off of a test when they first start school and then they will be tested again mid-year to see what their strengths and weaknesses are.</text>

HI Pauline! I just wanted to say that I think it is awesome that you have decided to go to school! My mom went back after being out for 30 years and I really admired that about her. Hopefully we will get to know each other in class and good luck with everything :)

Hello Hello. I agree have that students should have fun while they learn and that teachers should be very knowledgable in their field.  I always hated when a student would ask a question and the teacher would play it off as a &quot;great research practice&quot; when in reality they just do not know the answer. It makes me feel that if they did not take the time to learn it, then why should I? I see your passion for music and know this will definiely help your students remain motivated:) [[User:Melbell|Melbell]] ([[User talk:Melbell|talk]]) 01:48, 6 September 2008 (UTC)


Nice to see someone else from outside the 'Burg. I grew up in Monongahela before moving to Virginia when I was 12. I now live in a small country town and always said I would move back that way when I graduated college, but I didn't. I ended up liking the country-life better! I agree with your teaching philosophy when you say that teachers should become experts in their fields. If a teacher isn't an expert, how can they be capable of teaching the students. [[User:Bbomb003|Bbomb003]] ([[User talk:Bbomb003|talk]]) 15:00, 8 September 2008 (UTC)

Aloha!
I went to Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and loved it there.  I went to high school in Mechanicsburg, PA, so I know what you mean about the seasons.  I currently live in VA, so we're a little warmer perhaps, than PA.  I will have to look up what a mellophone is.  Re: teachers and their expertise, I feel a lot of teachers have knowledge, but lack the human connection or forgotten what it feels like to be a kid/student, adolescent!  What a difficult age.  I do agree with you in terms of having passion for the subject.  I think that's what makes a teacher a great teacher, as I'm sure you will be.  I think the challenge of any teacher to be an &quot;expert&quot; is a life-long, career-long process.  Otherwise, we'd all have PhDs, and be writing books on the subject, or be afraid to teach for fear of not knowing enough.  I know I'm still learning as I start my career as a teacher and by no means do I feel like an &quot;expert&quot; with a wealth of knowlege.  It's a learning process for me too!  Hey, I sing with Choral Arts Society of Washington, and I love it when we can put on a great symphonic choral work (Carmina Burana, Beethoven's 9th, and this fall Verdi's Requiem).  Do you sing also?[[User:Jsmit219|Jsmit219]] ([[User talk:Jsmit219|talk]]) 22:11, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

Thank you so much for your comment on my about the author page. Your page is so unique. I love the picture and colors that you used. It must be exciting traveling all those different places and moving in your own home. Your teaching philosphy is so true because it is very important for the students to look up to us as teachers. That is so cool how you keep in touch with your old teachers. They must have had a big impact on you. In response to you asking how I relate to older kids, I think that I am still a big kid at heart. I love to have fun with them and talk to them one on one about different things because I once went through them too. I feel like I can help them overcome some of those obstacles that they have to face growing up as adolescents. I think me also having an older neice helps too.

[[Image:Trippa.jpg|thumb|Tripe]]
'''Tripe''' is a type of edible [[Cookbook:Organ Meat|offal]] from the stomachs of various domestic animals

Beef tripe is usually made from only the first of three cow's stomachs, the rumen (blanket/flat/smooth tripe), the [reticulum (honeycomb and pocket tripe), and the omasum (book/bible/leaf tripe). Abomasum (reed) tripe is seen much less frequently, owing to its glandular tissue content. Tripe is also produced from sheep, goats, and pigs.
Unwashed (or &quot;green&quot;) tripe includes some of the stomach's last content, smells very unappetizing and is unsuitable for human consumption, but is used in dog food. While it is always washed before use for this purpose, the procedure is not as thorough as that employed for human consumption.</text>

[[Image:Beef tongue pancetta.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Beef Tongue Pancetta]] 
Beef tongue is literally the tongue of cattle. The human consumption of beef tongue dates back to the days of Paleolithic hunters, who preferred the fatty portions of the carcass including tongues, as well as organs, brains, feet and marrow. Beef tongue is very high in fat, at almost 75% of its calories derived. Some countries, such as Canada, and specifically the province of Alberta who have a large beef export industry, export large quantities of beef tongue.

===Preparation===

Beef tongue is often seasoned with onion and other spices, and then placed in a bowl to boil. After it has cooked the skin is often removed and the rest of the tongue is served. Pickled tongue is often used by the preparer because it is already spiced. If cooked in a sauce, it can then later be reused as a sauce for meatballs or any other food item.

===Beef tongue around the world===

Tongue is widely used in Mexican cuisine, and often seen in tacos and burritos. Boiled tongue or boiled brisket is traditionally eaten on the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, a harvest festival also known as the Feast of Tabernacles. Also, beef tongue is a part of Romanian cuisine, German cuisine, Portuguese cuisine, Persian cuisine, Philippine cuisine, Albanian cuisine, Russian Cuisine and Japanese Cuisine (the dish gyutan originating in the city of Sendai).</text>

'''Pinto or mottled beans'''

The '''pinto bean''' (Spanish: ''frijol pinto'', literally &quot;painted bean&quot;) is named for its mottled skin, hence it is a type of mottled bean. It is the most common bean in the United States  and northwestern Mexico, and is most often eaten whole in broth or mashed and refried. Either whole or mashed, it is a common filling for burritos. The young pods may also be used as green beans.

In the southwest United States, the pinto bean is an important symbol of regional identity. Along with the chile/chilli, it is one of the official state vegetables of New Mexico (under the name ''frijol''). The prepared beans are commonly known as frijoles. 

This is the most commonly used bean used for refried beans (fresh or canned) and in many dishes at Tex-Mex restaurants. Rice and pinto beans served with cornbread or corn tortillas are often a staple meal where there is limited money for meat, as the combination of beans and corn provides virtually all the protein amino acids needed in a meat substitute.  When it comes to making chili, if a bean is added, this is the one typically used, although the kidney bean, black bean, and many others may also be used in other locales. 

Pinto bean varieties include:

* Sierra
* Burke
* Othello
* Maverick

The ''alubia pinta alavesa'', or the ''Álava'' pinto bean, is a red variety of the pinto bean which originated in Añana, a town and municipality located in the province of Álava, in the Basque Country of northern Spain. In October, ''La Feria de la alubia pinta alavesa'', (The Festival of the Alubia pinta alavesa), is celebrated in Pobes.

[[Image:DSCF3525 cheezit macro sm.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A Cheez-It cracker.]]
[[Image:Crackers with herring and garlic sauce.jpg|thumb|200px|Crackers as part of a [[Cookbook:Snack|snack]]]]

A '''cracker''' is a type of biscuit that developed from military hardtack and nautical ship biscuits. 

===Types===

The holes in crackers are called &quot;docking&quot; holes. The holes are placed in the dough to stop air pockets from forming in the cracker while baking.

The name &quot;cracker&quot; is most often applied to flat biscuits with a savoury, salty flavour, in distinction from a &quot;cookie,&quot; which may be similar to a &quot;cracker&quot; in appearance and texture, but is sweetened. Crackers may be further distinguished from cookies by the manner in which they are made. Crackers are made from layered dough not unlike puff pastry while cookies are made from a dough similar to cake batter but without a leavening agent. Crackers sometimes have cheese or spices as ingredients, or even chicken stock. 

Brands including Captain's Wafers, Club Crackers, Town House Crackers, Ritz Crackers, Cream crackers and Water biscuits are often spread with cheese, pâté, or mousse.

Saltine and oyster crackers are often used in or served with soup.

Mock apple pie is made from Ritz (or similar) crackers.

Graham crackers and digestive biscuits are somewhere between crackers and cookies and were invented with health benefits in mind.</text>

      <comment>/* Install using a live CD (recommended) */ Not &quot;Install Ubuntu&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">If you want to install Ubuntu into your hard disk, you may use the following methods:

=== Install using a live CD (recommended) ===
The live CD installer works by cloning the working Ubuntu system into the hard disk.
# Insert the live CD into the computer's CD drive, then restart the computer from CD.
# Select '''Install'''.
# After the installer appears on the screen, follow the instructions.

=== Install using an alternate CD ===
The alternate CD uses the Debian text-based installer, and install the packages one-by-one. It offers features like RAID/LVM, and install a system without GUI. The final system is near-identical to the system installed from the live CD.
# Insert the alternate CD into the computer's CD drive, then restart the computer from CD.
# Select '''Install Ubuntu'''.
# After the text-based installer appears on the screen, follow the instructions.

=== Install using Wubi ===
This type of installation works by creating a disk image in an existing Windows partition, loop-mount it and install to it. It doesn't involve any partitioning.
# Go to the web, download the Wubi installer and run it.
# Follow the instructions. (Wubi will download the Ubuntu CD image for you automatically.)
# After rebooting the system, select Ubuntu in the boot menu and let it finish the installation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Windows was a graphical interface run on top of DOS developed by Microsoft. It later was merged with the Windows NT line and became a &quot;complete&quot; operating system. By comparison it has a large market share on desktop PCs, but has been losing its supremecy due to the improvements made to alternative free OSs, where some even have the capacity to run applications meant only for Windows. Another factor in the decline of Windows as a desktop OS has been the increased use of resources (memory, CPU and hard drive space) and that later versions haven't catered to the real needs of users. This was made mostly evident by the Millenium edition and later with Windows Vista, where a merely mercantile approach  seems to drive each new release and not technological innovation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The GNU Project was created by Richard Stallman to develop a Unix-like &quot;free&quot; operating system — software which respects its users freedoms. Unix-like operating systems comprise software collections of applications, libraries, and programmer/developer tools, all overlaid on a &quot;kernel&quot; - the program that allocates resources and communicates with the hardware.

'''Linux''' is a kernel (the operating system component that interfaces directly with the hardware) project started by [[w:Linus Torvalds|Linus Torvalds]], developed under the [[w:GPL|GNU General Public License]]. 

The combination of GNU and Linux is the GNU/Linux operating system, used by millions and usually, incorrectly, simply called “Linux”.

Because of its stability, it is often used on servers and mission critical systems.

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a recent contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has its own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/Chess/Index_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator (See below), a chess diagram upgrade (looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.
Regards

==Who is this?==
Samuel Adams.

==What did he do that made him important?==
After the United States declared its independence in 1776, Adams helped write the Massachusetts Constitution with John Adams and James Bowdoin.  Afterward, Adams helped draft the Articles of Confederation. 

==What did he do when he was young?==
Adams was born on Sunday, September 27, 1722. In 1736, at age fourteen, he entered Harvard College to begin studies in theology. While at Harvard, Adams gradually shifted his interest to politics and political theory. He went on to pursue graduate studies at Harvard after receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1740. Adams began to develop his political beliefs about the rights of colonists and British control over America.

==What did he do afterward?==
Following the end of the American Revolutionary War, he ran for the House of Representatives in the 1st United States Congressional election, but was unsuccessful. He was elected Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts in 1789, and after John Hancock's death in 1793, Adams served as the acting governor until he was elected governor in January of the following year. He served in that position until June 1797 when he retired from politics. He died six years later on October 2, 1803.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== About Me ==


I am jgood031.  My real name is Jennifer.  I am working on my M.S.ED. degree from ODU.  I hope to teach K-6th grade in the public school system.  I am taking my courses at a Southwestern Virginia distance learning site.  I graduated from Radford University in 1994, and I have a undergraduate degree in Social Work.  I have three kids, and I have been married for eighteen years.  I am currently working as a preschool teacher in a private school.  I also substitute teach in the school system where I live.  



== Hobbies ==


When I have free time I love doing outdoorsy things.  I love hiking, riding my bike, camping, or just being with my kids doing anything.



== My Educational Philosophy ==


I believe it takes more than a degree to be a good teacher.  In other words, being a good teacher comes from within.  You have to want to dedicate your yourself in many ways.  A good teacher makes sure their students grasp not only how to think and learn.  They need to make sure their students become productive members of society, and that they are instilled with good values, and morals.  It takes hard work and dedication being a good teacher. It means knowing that not all students learn alike.  For example,  they know that a ADHD student learns information much differently than the average student.  They should not be expected to learn the same, and adjustments in the classroom should be made.  To sum it all up, being a good teacher takes doing whatever you can, no matter how much time and effort, to make sure your students succeed.</text>

I grew up in Petersburg, Virginia and spent most of my life training as a ballet dancer.  I have trained with the Pennsylvania Ballet and I have been a performing company member with the Richmond Ballet, the Concert Ballet, the Tidewater Ballet, and the Petersburg Ballet. Today, I am many things - a daughter, a sister, a student, a babysitter, a soccer coach, a school volunteer, but most importantly, I am a Mom! I have two sons of my own, ages twenty and thirteen (yes, I am forty-five years old!); and many more children who refer to me as their second mom. The photo shows me with Magnum, my owner (and yes I mean MY owner, because he considers me his possession!).  He is a very large solid black German Shepherd whose ears forgot to stand up!

'''&lt;/big&gt;'''LIFE GOALS AND PHILOSPHIES''''''

My goals, other than obtaining my teaching degree, are really very simple: face life head on and no matter what comes - HAVE FUN! Believe it or not, chilren taught me this lesson!  In fact, it was my time spent with children that led to the discovery that I have a natural ability with them. Children grow through their interactions with me! As such, my life philosophy and my educational philosophy go hand in hand! I profoundly hope that I can use this gift in the academic setting to instill &quot;uninhibited confidence&quot; in the ''whole child'', because I believe that in order to learn, and live, we must, first, BELIEVE THAT WE CAN!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've been down this road.... Sometimes it's the radiator, sometimes it's the water pump, sometimes it's the thermostat, sometimes it's a lack of fluid, or a combination of all of these.

Your objective is to keep that temp gauge out of the red.

My advice to you.... Turn the heat up on high, turn down the windows.

This worked for me until I replaced all three items, it never overheats now.
----
Could be a couple of things: 
# Water pump (check if it's good, if not, replace)
# Thermostat (three dollars to replace)
# Radiator (Flush, repair, and replace)
# Fan clutch; this is the fan connected to the engine, it could be bad (timing off) etc. and lastly check if hoses are good and do not collapse.

If these are not the problem, then it could be a more complex problem, keep in mind it is an old vehicle and they way it was treated could significantly change the reason it is overheating.  Many other things that are nor reachable by hand can be clogged up or sensors nor working properly.


The closed style cooling system on early XJ models (1991 and earlier) can lead the hoses and fittings to harden and break because of aging. This results in small leaks and causes the engine to overheat.

Insufficient flushing of the cooling system or poor maintenance could result in a coked up system.

On newer type XJ's (1993 and later) the cylinder heads (mostly between cylinder 4, 5 or 6) and/or gaskets can break; broken cylinder heads can only be spotted by looking into the oil filling hole when the engine is running.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Fort_Ticonderoga_1775.jpg‎|thumb|400px|Ethan Allen demanding the surrender of Fort Ticonderoga.]]
==Who is this?==
Ethan Allen

==What did he do that made him important?==
He was an early American revolutionary leader. He captured Fort Ticonderoga on May 10, 1775, from the British forces. Allen's men also quickly captured forts at Crown Point, Fort Ann on Isle La Motte near the present Canadian border, and the town of St John. The huge stores of cannon and powder seized at Ticonderoga allowed the American rebels to break the stalemate at the siege of Boston, which caused the British to evacuate the city in March 1776.
Allen also took part in the invasion of Canada in late 1775. However, when he led an attack on Montreal, he was captured and the attack failed. Allen was shipped to Britain in 1776, then back to New York City, which had been captured by the British, in 1778. Soon after arriving in New York City, he was exchanged and freed.

==What did he do when he was young?==
Ethan Allen was born on January 10, 1738 in Litchfield, Connecticut, as the first-born child of Joseph and Mary Baker Allen. 

==What did he do afterward?==
After being freed, Allen moved back to Vermont, disliking both the United States and the British. Vermont was also harboring a significant number of deserters from the armies of both. Allen settled in the delta of the Winooski River in what became the modern city of Burlington. Allen became active in Vermont politics and was appointed a major general of the Vermont militia in 1779, using the position to harass New York settlers as part of the New Hampshire Grants controversy between New York, nascent states Vermont and New Hampshire and the Continental Congress.

In 1778, Allen appeared before the Continental Congress on behalf of a claim by Vermont for recognition as an independent state. Due to the New York (and New Hampshire) claim on Vermont, Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood to Vermont. Allen then negotiated with the governor of Canada between 1780 and 1783 in order to establish Vermont as a British province and to gain military protection for its residents. Because of this, the United States charged him with treason; however the charge was never substantiated.

Allen died 22 days after his birthday on February 12, 1789, of a stroke, at the age of 51, in Burlington, Chittenden, Vermont. He was buried in Green Mount Cemetery, Burlington, Vermont.

==How do we remember him today?==
Two ships of the United States Navy have been named Ethan Allen in his honor, as well as Fort Ethan Allen, a cavalry outpost in Colchester and Essex, Vermont. The Spirit of Ethan Allen III is a tour boat line in Lake Champlain. The Ethan Allen Express, an Amtrak train line running from New York City to Rutland, Vermont, is also named after him.

A statue of Allen represents Vermont in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol.

Ethan Allen's name is the trademark of the furniture and housewares manufacturer, Ethan Allen Inc., which was founded in 1932 in Beecher Falls, Vermont.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Abraham Baldwin.jpg|250px|thumb|Abraham Baldwin]]

==Who is this?==
Abraham Baldwin

==What did he do that made him important?==
Abraham Baldwin was an American politician, Patriot, and Founding Father from the U.S. state of Georgia. Baldwin was a Georgia representative in the Continental Congress and served in the United States House of Representatives and Senate after the adoption of the Constitution.

==What did he do when he was young?==
Abraham Baldwin was born at Guilford, Connecticut. After attending a local village school, Abraham graduated from Yale University in nearby New Haven in 1772. Three years later, he became a minister and tutor at the college. He held that position until 1779. 

==What did he do afterward?==
After the convention (1787 - 1789), Baldwin was elected to the U.S. Congress, where he served for 18 years. He served in the House of Representatives for 10 years and in the senate for 8 years. During these years he became an ally of Madison and Jefferson and the Democratic-Republicans. In the Senate, he presided for a year as President pro tempore.

==How do we remember him today?==
Baldwin died after a short illness when he was 53 years old in 1807.  Still serving in the Senate at the time, he was buried in Washington's Rock Creek Cemetery.  Baldwin County, Alabama, Baldwin County, Georgia, and Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC) in southern Georgia are all named after him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:JosiahBartlett3.jpg|200px|thumb|Josiah Bartlett]]
==Who is this?==
Josiah Bartlett
==What did he do that made him important?==
Josiah Bartlett was an American physician and statesman who, as a delegate to the Continental Congress for New Hampshire, signed the Declaration of Independence. He was later Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Superior Court of Judicature and Governor of the state.

==What did he do when he was young?==
Josiah Bartlett was born in Amesbury, Massachusetts to Stephen and Hannah-Mary (Webster) Bartlett. By the age of sixteen, he had built a foundation in Latin and learned some Greek. He also began the study of medicine. Before Bartlett turned twenty-one, in 1750, he moved to Kingston, New Hampshire in Rockingham County, and began his practice.

On August 2, 1776 when delegates signed the formal copy of the Declaration of Independence, his position made him the second to sign, just after John Hancock, the president of the Congress.

==What did he do afterward?==
In 1788, Bartlett was made the Chief Justice of the state's supreme court. That same year he was a delegate to the New Hampshire convention for adoption of the Constitution, serving part of the time as its Chairman. He argued for ratification, which finally took place on June 21, 1788. The legislature of the new State of New Hampshire, selected him to be a U. S. Senator, but he declined the office.

==How do we remember him today?==
He retired to his home in Kingston, and died there on May 19, 1795. He is buried next to his wife Mary in the Plains Cemetery, also at Kingston. Relatives of Bartlett still live in his home and give tours throughout the year.

A bronze statue of Bartlett stands in the town square of Amesbury, Massachusetts. His portrait hangs in the State House in Concord, New Hampshire, drawn from an original by Jonathan Trumbull. 

Bartlett, New Hampshire is named in his honor, and The Josiah Bartlett elementary school is a visible presence on its major roadway. A town just north of North Conway, NH, has the name Bartlett.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, my name is Shannon. I am originally from the often misunderstood state of New Jersey. I am a first semester Education Student working on my Master's Degree and Library/Media Studies Certification.  I performed my undergraduate work at James Madison University, Harrisonburg VA. I graduated in 1998 with a B.S. from the Speech Communications Department with a minor in Anthropology.  After 10 years of traveling around the country and living in states such as Michigan, California and New Jersey performing various jobs, I have returned to Virginia to embark upon a Graduate Degree in Education with the dream of becoming a School Librarian.

I am a self-proclaimed book-worm who enjoys researching topics of interest.  I love art, music, culture, traveling and of course reading. I have had various jobs since I graduated from JMU. One of which included driving a fork-lift!  I could very well be considered a Jill-of-all-Trades, Master-of-none. I am very excited to be starting work in the field of Education and acquiring my Master's Degree.

==Teaching Philosophy ==
My main philosophy for teaching involves the belief that all people have the ability to succeed and learn, we need just to find our passion and have the courage to persue our dreams.  I strongly believe that people desire to succeed but often do not know where to begin.  I want to encourage all people to find what they enjoy doing and teach them how they can achieve these goals.  That is why I am so drawn to the library.  I see the library as a hugely untapped resource, especially for the current generation of children who spend many of their hours playing video games.   I hope that by becoming a school librarian I can encourage people to find out more about themselves so that they can become successful in whatever field they choose.

I hope to encourage children to use the library to explore all different subjects, different cultures, different careers, and to only be limited by their imagination.  I want to encourage them to read about the things that fascinate them and teach them how they can research these thing so that they can gather more information about them.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Assignment 2 update - rationale==

I tweaked Assignment 2 in some ways - I hope you'll agree it's a step on from the basic work done before.

Terminology: We (our college, I'm not royalty!) divide each unit into assignments, and each assignment is divided into tasks. The old text treated the whole unit as one 'assignment' and I've changed that now.

I've expanded the tasks somewhat.

Criterion P2 doesn't require a lab design, just 'identify key features in the design of a specialist laboratory'. Therefore, I moved the design part to Task 2b (covering criterion M2) and made Task 2a just an exercise in listing design features.

== Thank you ==

Thanks so much.  I have just had this unit given to me and I didnt quite know where to start.</text>

      <comment>/* About Me */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Mary's_China_Vacation_(2).jpg|300px|right]]
== '''About Me''' ==

My name is Mary and I was born and lived most of the first half of my life in the great state of Texas. As an Army brat, I also spent a few years in Heidelberg, Germany and Washington D.C., but these brief excursions occurred in the first few years of my life so I remember little about these moments. I will always consider myself a Texan.


I am a mother of three wonderful sons and married to my soul mate. Throughout the many years of my adulthood, my husband's Naval career has given us the wonderful opportunity to experience life outside of our known culture, and to see not only the world, but broaden our thoughts and perspectives. We spent several years living in both London and the surrounding area of Tokyo, learning and experiencing alternative Western and Far Eastern views.

----

== '''Academics''' ==
 


I have spent many years in pursuit of an education and have changed majors several times. The chaos of both moving and raising young children has at times required reassessment or temporary delays along the way, but I am finally on the home stretch.


I began my college education many, many years ago at the University of Texas at Austin. I have also attended the University of Maryland overseas divisions, City of Chicago Colleges, Tidewater Community College, and am currently attending Old Dominion University.


I am a transfer student with an Associate in Interdisciplinary Studies and hope to complete my Bachelors at the end of the summer 2008 semester. My plans are to continue on a Masters program with a concentration in PreK-3rd grade.

----

== '''Personal Philosophy''' ==
I see myself as a part of a much greater whole.  I am more than a Texan, a Virginian, an American; I am a person of the world and hope to broaden my horizons and always experience life.  I want to have my bags packed and ready to go to places I have only previously seen in books and do things that I haven’t done before.  I want to live life to the fullest.  My home is a place to keep my things, its memories, experiences, and loved ones that are life.

----

== '''Teaching Philosophy''' ==

I hope to implement as much technology into my classroom as I am capable with the resources provided to me.  I believe the best way to engage the student in learning is to use the forums that are most relevant and enticing to the student, and that would mean enlisting the technology around us; podcasts, Internet, and a myriad of software to name only a few.  I believe that it is not enough to stay within a comfort zone.  As a teacher, I am as much of a student in the world as the students around me.  I see every day as an opportunity to learn, and every experience as a chance to grow.


I believe that it is important to be open-minded as both a teacher and a person.  I hope to instill in students the ability to see other ideas, opinions, and ways to approach and look at the world around them.  I hope to expand my receptiveness by looking for the potential in every child, even though they may have had a less than stellar previous experience in school.  I believe the student’s first day in class is a new day and an opportunity for a new beginning.   


I will look for the potential in every child.  I cannot foresee or determine when I, my school, the child’s developmental age, or maybe just the fish tank in the back of the classroom will be the spark that ignites a burst of learning and growth in a student.  If I fail to seek the potential in myself or in a student, then it is time to walk away from teaching.  I may not always succeed or see the results immediately, but I believe teaching and learning is not about being perfect or instantaneous results, it is about growing and helping others to grow and develop.</text>

Hello! I live in Fairfax County, Virginia, very close to Washington, D.C. I am attending school and getting my teaching liscence at Old Dominion University. Once I get my liscence, I plan to teach K-6. I work at an elementary school right, in Fairfax County, doing an after school program with K-6-- I LOVE working with all of the kids! I have been doing this for the past three years, and this is what has made me decide to persue my Elementary School Education lisence. I love going to work every day and seeing the kids-- they make me laugh and smile!  But really, ever since I was in second grade and have been influenced my great teachers, I have decided I have wanted to be a teacher. This picture is of my cousins, they are from all over the United States. I like to say learning across the USA!


[[Image:cousins2.jpg|'''My family learing across the USA'''''Italic text''!]]

== &lt;big&gt;'''Educational Philosophy'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
My educational philosophy has many components. As I am learning throughout the year, I am sure I will add more and change as well. I feel that when I have my own classroom I will stay constantly engaged with other teachers so I can compare ideas on children, tests and ideas. I will want to keep parents informed on their children's progress throughout the year. I think that I will have to make sure that I dont talk to some parents more than others, or let some parents call, email all of the time. Diversity and special needs students are very special in a classroom. Because of the special needs, I think that you cannot treat all children the same. You can pay attention to all children but you can't nessarily give them the same course work. What if a child cant read in Kindergarden class while the others can? I think this means they may need a little more focus at home and specialized at school. I can't wait to learn more and start teaching!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi...my name is Megan. I am from Gretna, Va. I am enrolled in the PK-6 program through Old Dominion University Distance Learning at CVCC in Lynchburg, VA. I plan to have my Master's in 3 years, and hope to teach 1st grade one day. 


My philosophy on Education: Communication

What's a classroom without proper communication? As a teacher, I must correspond with my students in a manner that is easily understood and passed on. If I am to succeed, I must communicate with my principal, fellow teachers, and other administrators often and respectively. 

Students learn what is communicated to them, whether intentional or unintentional. I strive to communicate positive influences and the tools of education to my students properly and in an orderly fashion.

Sometimes, conflicts arise during communication and messages are not sent clearly. I hope to overcome these conflicts with ease, whether it be with a student, administrator, or fellow teacher, and in a manner that is understood and solves the issue.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;About Me&lt;/u&gt;

My name is Jackie. I am a mother of four, ages 27, 20,18 and 16. I am also married to a wonderful man who is very supportive of me going to school. '''I will recieve my Masters in Education.''' I was born in N.C. and raised in N.Y.. Although I moved to Va in 1988 I am still a native NewYorker. Soon after moving here my parents and two sisters followed suit. I still however have a brother living in N.J. 

&lt;u&gt;Favorite Things to Do&lt;/u&gt;

I consider myself a creative person. I love crocheting, sewing, and scrapebooking just to name a few. My absolute favorite thing to do is SINGING. I am an active member in my church and I sing in the choir. I have been apart of the church chior since 1998. There was a time when I left the choir after surgery. Sitting out with the congregation and not in the choirstand felt very strange indeed. Once I recovered I went right back to where I belong (in the chior).

&lt;u&gt;My Philosophy on Teaching&lt;/u&gt;

I believe that teaching is a calling, not everyone can do the job. To me it is very much like singing in the choir. When I am not there doing what I love, I feel out of place. I have a desire to learn and teach. I believe that education is the way out of many difficult situations. Education is the key that unlocks the door to where your dreams are, with out the key you can't get in. Reading is a very important factor. Reading expands your vision and opens your mind to wonderful possiblities. I want to be a part of that.

I believe that every child '''can''' learn, however, every child does not learn in the same way. It is up to us, the teacher to figure out which way is the best way for each child we encounter.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Marquis de Lafayette 3.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Marquis de La Fayette]]
==Who is this?==
Marquis de La Fayette

==What did he do that made him important?==
Marquis de La Fayette arrived in America from France in 1777 at the age of 19.  He was looking for a commission as an officer in the Continental Army and went to Congress to seek one.  To his disappointment he as not assigned a unit, and was about to return home, when Benjamin Franklin wrote to George Washington and asked that Washington take La Fayette as an Aide-de-camp.  Washington agreed, and first met La Fayette on August 10, 1777.  La Fayette made a major impression on Washington when Washington remarked that he was embarrassed to show a French officer the state of their camps.  La Fayette replied &quot;I am here to learn, not to teach.&quot;

Lafayette's first battle was the loss at Brandywine on 11 September 1777. After the British outflanked the Americans, Washington acquiesced to a request by Lafayette to join General John Sullivan. Upon his arrival, Lafayette went with the Third Pennsylvania Bridge, under Brigadier Thomas Conway and attempted to rally the unit to face the attack. In face of the British and Hessian numeric superiority, Lafayette was shot in the leg. During the American retreat, before being treated for his wound, Lafayette created a control point allowing a more orderly retreat Following the battle, he was cited by George Washington for &quot;bravery and military ardour&quot; and was recommended for the command of a division in a letter to the congress on 1 November.

After two months of rest, Lafayette was well enough to return to the field and assisted General Nathanael Greene in reconnaissance of British positions in New Jersey. With 300 soldiers he defeated a numerically superior Hessian force in Gloucester on 24 November 1777. He returned to Valley Forge for the winter, where he was asked by the War Board, headed by General Horatio Gates, to travel to Albany, New York where he led troops preparing for an invasion of Canada. Gates was capitalizing on his success in the Battle of Saratoga, hoping to remove Washington from command, and this plan included separating him from Lafayette. Lafayette awaited the coming approval from Washington before departing for Albany, where he found the men insufficient to mount a Canadian invasion. Lafayette wrote Washington of the situation and made plans to return to Valley Forge. Before his departure, he was able to recruit the Oneida tribe, who referred to Lafayette as Kayewla, which means fearsome horsemen, to the American side.

Lafayette returned to Valley Forge and Gates' plan to assume control of the Army was halted. Meanwhile, in March 1778, treaties signed by America and France were made public and France formally recognized American independence. In reply to the French entrance into the war, the British withdrew from Philadelphia and General Howe sent 5,000 soldiers to attack Lafayette, hoping to capture him for his political value. On 20 May 1778, Lafayette was warned of the impending attack, and, in an attempt to feign numerical superiority, he ordered that a few men appear from the woods, on an outcropping known as Battle of Barren Hill (present day Lafayette Hill) periodically to fire upon the British. Lafayette was then able to cross Matson's Ford with the remainder of his force. As the British evacuated their force north, the Continental Army attacked at the Monmouth Courthouse, with Lafayette present. 

In 1781, Washington sent Lafayette down to Virginia to keep Lord Cornwallis and his army of 9,000 men in Yorktown, Virginia, until Washington arrived with the main Franco-American Army.

==What did he do when he was young?==

==What did he do afterward?==

==How do we remember him today?==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Reading your philosophy of education was very inspiring. I completely agree with you about giving students the right to ask questions and give their own opinions on topics. We can give them all the facts in the world, but it really is about what they take away from it, the conclusions that they come to once the evidence has been presented to them. Our goal is to teach each student, with the knowledge that each individual student is coming from a different set of circumstances, and each student thinks and perceives things in a slightly different way.

Wow you have a lot going on and I hope that you accomplish it all. I truely believe in your educational philosophies and you have a great and definitely interesting point because what I first thought of while reading into your about the author other than your full life is a lot of people (especially the children) forget that teachers are their leaders and we are trying to lead them into a better life not saying that the life they live are bad we just want them to have that reason to wake up every morning thinking today im going to get inspire by Mr. or Ms. So and so today and they believe that I can make it and do whatever I put my mind to. I had a teacher like that in college that made me change my major to education because she would always tell us that &quot;we can do anything that we set our mind to&quot; and not to always think that life would come easy. She would be so excited about coming to work with the &quot;bad&quot; children in my class everyday that I wanted to feel that way (and I was not going to get that from my previous field of Education, which was Nursing) and so I decided to get a job at a daycare and I have been loving pretty much every moment since then. I enjoy my kids and my job. Also, we are the disciplinarians and it shows with your students who love you and brag about you saying &quot;even though my teacher put me in time out today I understand why and I still love her.&quot; which one of my students really said to their parents about me. Its joy like that that make you enjoiy what you do to inspire these children. So continue what you are doing and remember to inspire your children.

== '''General Info''' ==

I am Beth Miller and I have been living in Newport News, VA for about 9 years. I am originally from Jersey, however, I am from South Jersey (outside of Philly) so I do not talk like the characters on the ''Sopranos'' and  “which exit” jokes do not apply :-) I have come to appreciate the Tidewater area because its location is perfect for enjoying outdoor activities.   

I earned my BA in fine arts and English from CNU in 2004 and currently teach middle school drama and computer art. I have worked in education for about 13 years doing a variety of jobs: para for SpEd, pre-school/ daycare, tutoring, residential services, and more (I just can’t remember). I never really intended to become a full-time teacher. When I graduated from CNU, I had plans to get my MFA in ceramics from Rochester Institute of Technology. However, my husband and I couldn’t afford the tuition so I ended up getting a provisional license and started teaching again. 
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
== '''Philosophy of Education (Laughter is Survival)''' ==

'''INTRO'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
I never really gave much thought to my philosophy of education. I have always had strong opinions about teaching, but an actual philosophy? I'm not too sure. As I mentioned, I got back into teaching by default. My previous experiences left me feeling cynical and frustrated and I had no intention of having a career in education. But here I am teaching middle school art and drama, and I like it (most of the time:-).  

Listed below is an outline of my philosophy, as well as some of the strategies I actually use in my classroom. Overall, I think I take more of a student-centered approach to teaching.

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
'''LEARNING'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
I think education should center on learning. Sounds obvious, I know. However, by learning I don’t mean memorizing. I know the frustration teachers feel with regard to NCLB and the SOL tests. I also know that, for most, the frustration isn’t just about extra work, it’s about having to teach to a test. I understand the need for accountability, but I disagree when it is at the expense of student learning. Sadly, I have watched students’ creativity and critical thinking skills suffer because they are learning how to take and pass tests rather than how to think and apply knowledge. Memorizing and dumping isn’t the same as learning and applying. Learning should be a lifelong experience and not for the sole purpose of passing tests. 

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
'''FOCUS'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
My classes are centered on the students more than the content. I have a general idea of the projects/ units I am going to assign, but it is only a loose plan and often changes with the dynamics of the classroom. There is a basic structure and routine, but I will alter the lessons if necessary. For example, if the students are particularly “excited” (you know I really mean crazy) then I’m definitely not going to assign them a project that’s going to increase that energy, unless I have the space for them to use it appropriately. To do so, would be unfair to everyone. Because of my experience in SpEd, inclusion isn’t an issue. My subjects are very easy to adapt to all learning styles and needs so I don’t really stress over students that may need additional support.

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
'''GROUP PROJECTS AND TEAMWORK''' 

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
I lecture as little as possible, usually only at the beginning of a new unit or to give instructions. This strategy accomplishes a few things. First, it gives me the opportunity to work with and get to know individual students. It is also a good way to speak with a student privately without it being embarrassing. Second, it teaches them how to work with others and accomplish a task. This fosters communication, cooperation and self-awareness. I emphasize the importance of teamwork and building on each member's strengths. Third, it keeps the students engaged because it's fun! 

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
'''WE’RE ALL HUMAN'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
I am a very relaxed teacher. I am kind of lenient which is both a strength and weakness. I’m sarcastic, silly and often laugh at the stupid mistakes I make in the middle of teaching (I don't take myself serious). Because of this, the students often find me amusing – it never hurts to be entertaining! By showing my “human side” there is no intimidation and that creates a trusting and comfortable classroom environment. It also relieves tension during class critiques or serious discussions. 

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
'''CONNECTING'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
My biggest goal as a teacher is to make a connection with every single student. I think I am successful because I am always honest with them – even when I would rather lie (luckily, I don’t embarrass easy!). I also genuinely enjoy hearing about their lives. I feel like I am able to connect with them on many different levels: music, movies, sports etc. (everything but TV – I hate TV). I try to support them with their outside interests and listen when they need to talk. Building a connection also makes discipline a little easier because the relationship is built on respect. 

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
'''RESPECT'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
All of my students know that my number one rule is Respect. I use this rule to encompass all of the other rules and to teach tolerance.  I explain that it also includes my respecting them. This often comes as a surprise, especially to the students that are used to teachers treating them negatively based on past incidents.

I think it is very important for students to learn to accept others even when they are different. I tell them that they don’t have to agree, love, convert, date etc. someone that is different, but they do have to be respectful and tolerant of their differences. I think this is especially important because they need to understand how intolerance can lead to fear, hate, anger and violence. Kids can be cruel, especially in middle school, and bullying is a big problem, so I try to encourage kindness by focusing on respect/ tolerance in my classroom.   

&lt;font color=&quot;#800000&quot;&gt;
'''LAST WORDS'''

&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;
Overworked and over-exhausted, underpaid and under-appreciated…so why teach? 

I really don’t care about grades and other formal aspects of teaching. I don’t really think it matters in the scheme of things. But I do care about exposing students to new information and watching them get excited about it. I am thrilled when they come see me the next year and remind me about something we discussed in class and how it applied to them over the summer. Or, when during the school year, another teacher tells me that her class said they already learned about “that stuff” in Mrs. Miller’s class and they were excited to talk about what they had learned – not memorized, learned! 

Most of all, I am happy when I truly make a difference in their lives. I have had several students over the years tell me that I taught them to be kinder and more open to people who are different. Some have told me that I was the only teacher that actually liked them or was patient enough to get to know them. Others just tell me that my class was awesome and they had so much fun. 

All of those things make teaching worth it for me. Oh yeah, and middle-schoolers are really funny!</text>

&lt;font color=&quot;#660099&quot; face=&quot;COMIC SANS MS&quot;&gt;Hi! My name is Megan Parker. I am currently 23 years old and am an elementary education student at Old Dominion University. Elementary Education is my third choice in majors, but I think I finally got it right this time! During the school year I substitute teach in Chesapeake, and I absolutely love it. It has secured my choice in professions, and it's the best practice for my future that I could ask for. The children are wonderful and they inspire me everyday. I keep very busy in my everyday life working two jobs, one full time and one part time, while also going to school full time.  I also have the added task of planning my wedding next summer. Wish me luck!!

&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#99ff33&quot; face=&quot;LUCIDA Handwriting&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;'''My Philosophy of Education'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0080&quot; face=&quot;COMIC SANS MS&quot;&gt;Expect this to change frequently...

&lt;font color=&quot;#009999&quot; face=&quot;COMIC SANS MS&quot;&gt;Teachers should encompass adequate knowledge and skills to be an intellectual and moral role model for students. They should be ready and willing to do what it takes to see that a child is successful in their schooling, while also enjoying themselves, and therefore making sure that students are prepared for what they may encounter when they leave the classroom.

&lt;font color=&quot;#ff9966&quot; face=&quot;COMIC SANS MS&quot;&gt;My favorite time as a child was when I was in primary and elementary school. I remember having so much fun and loving all of my teachers. I even still keep in touch with a few of them; that is something I can't say about the teachers as a I grew older. I look back and think about all the wonderful memories I have of that time period, and how every teacher made such a positive impact on my life. I want to be one of those teachers. I hope in the future that I can make school as joyous of an experience for my students, as was done for me.</text>

      <comment>/* My Philosophy on Teaching */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
               &lt;u&gt;About Me&lt;/u&gt;
My name is Susan Burton and I am 22 years old. I recently got married and I love being a wife to my loving husband, Eric! I have an amazing mother, father, older brother, and younger brother who have helped me greatly pursue my college career. I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia and I will be receiving my masters in Elementary Education next December from Old Dominion University.  
In my very small amount of free time I love taking pictures and putting together scrapbooks. I also love spending time on my in-laws farm (I’m a country girl as heart!). I also love to spend time out doors camping or just tossing around a foot ball (GO COLTS!).

        &lt;u&gt;My Philosophy on Teaching&lt;/u&gt;
I have always loved to spend time with children and it amazes me to watch the wonder and the innocence’s in their eyes. Teaching is a profession that calls for someone with a heart big enough to care for the well being of the students, time to help them grow, and the hopes and dreams that they are making a difference in the world.  Teaching can not just be facts thrown at a student to be spit back on a test. Teaching must be involving the student and giving them hands on experience with the situations at hand. Students must be able to create and analyze their own problems as well as given the confidences that they can handle the problems set before them.</text>

==Hi==
Hi Krista- I really like your &quot;About the Author&quot;.  It is great to read about someone who is so passionate about teaching.  I think it is great that you want children to have fun when they learn. I am also working on my masters degree, but I plan on being a School Librarian.  As a self-proclaimed &quot;book-work&quot; I want to encourage young children to learn to love books.  I also want children have fun while they learn and I hope that I can teach them that reading can be just as fun as playing video games. Good luck with your future career. Shannon [[User:Sgree042|Sgree042]] ([[User talk:Sgree042|talk]]) 13:25, 12 September 2008 (UTC)


It is nice to see so many people with the understanding that being a teacher requires passion.  I have been teaching now for just about two years and love every minute (even the trying ones).  I am working on getting my certification and applaud you for getting your masters degree.  I hopefully will work on getting mine as well.  GOOD LUCK for the future and keep up the hard work!!!

My name is Pablo Morales.  I am 22 years old and I want to teach Social Studies in a Virginia Beach middle school or in Puerto Rico.  I was born in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico but attended high school in Columbia, Maryland.  I moved to Virginia Beach in the Summer of 2008 and am having a blast here.  I love taking risks and enjoying my life to the fullest.

I picture myself as being a teacher that deeply cares about my students and also fosters a fun classroom environment.  I want to make learning appealing and enjoyable for students.  I also want to be able to constantly motivate my students to perform above their expectations and to develop a love for learning.</text>

== Introduction ==

Hello everyone My name is Victor Gutierrez. I am 36, have been married for 8 years and have two children a girl 6 and a boy 3. I am returning to school to finish what I did not finish when I was younger. I was in manufacturing for 15 years and worked up the ranks to that but I found myself stuck in a job I was not really happy to have. Last year my wife and I relocated from the Silicon Valley in California to a suburb near Seattle, Washington. I am looking forward to finishing my degree and finally getting into the classroom.


== Philosophy ==

My teaching philosophy is still in a work in progress. I have a hard time thinking that education is a one size fits all concept. Being from California where there are a lot of migrant families it is hard to understand why all the children are put into a melting pot without much help, sink or swim. Most kids unfortunately sink, I find it hard to imagine that when kids begin to fall behind in Kindergarden and first grade, they simply have to struggle to catch up. Something needs to be done to get these kids that are falling behind caught up somehow, with summer school, or tutoring or, whatever it takes to get things right. I worry as a teacher when I have a class full of kids where some of them simply are not grasping the concepts. What as teachers are we supposed to do, teach down to the kids who cant or up to the kids who can. I guess the future will only tell but schools should adapt to the changing demographics that are blowing in the wind....</text>

    [[User:Vguti001|Vguti001]] ([[User talk:Vguti001|talk]]) 03:38, 1 September 2008 (UTC)   Vguti001 (talk) 03:37, 1 September 2008 (UTC)Hello everyone My name is Victor Gutierrez. I am 36, married for 8 years and have two children a girl 6 and a boy 3. I am returning to school to finish what I did not finish when I was younger. I was in manufacturing for 15 years and worked up the ranks to that but i found myself stuck in a job I was not really happy to have. Last year my wife and I relocated from the Silicon Valley in California to a suburb near Seattle, Washington. I am looking forward to finishing my degree and getting into the classroom.
My teaching philosophy is still in a work in progress. I have a hard time thinking that education is a one size fits all concept. Being from California where there are a lot of migrant families its hard to understand why all the children are put into a melting pot without much help, sink or swim. Most kids unfortunately sink, I find it hard to imagine that when kids begin to fall behind in Kindergarden and first grade, they simply have to struggle to catch up. Something needs to be done to get these kids that are falling behind caught up somehow, with summer school, or tutoring or, whatever it takes to get things right. I worry as a teacher when I have a class full of kids where some of them simply are not grabbing the concepts. What as teachers are we supposed to do, teach down to the kids who cant or up to the kids who can. I guess the future will only tell but schools should adapt to the changing demographics that are blowing in the wind....


Hi Victor my name is Shannon. Although I myself have always wanted to be a teacher  I have a friend doing the same thing as you she had been in advertising for several years when she decieded that that was not the place for her and is now getting her teaching licence. I think its great that you'll be switching to a job that you will actually happy to have.

Your teaching philosophy is alo great. I grew up in an area without a wide range of income or race or anything really then I moved closer to Washington D.C. and I now work with kids of low income houses and of all races. It does seem ridiculous that there are school systems who leave those who are strugling behind. I know there are certain children who just need more help than others for tons of different reasons. Good Luck!

== Hello! ==


[[Image:Image8yf.jpg|left|300px]]
[[User:Castelfam7625|Castelfam7625]] ([[User talk:Castelfam7625|talk]]) 01:38, 10 September 2008 (UTC) I really like your page. So if the exit jokes don't work, do the Janet Evanovich &quot;Stephanie Plum&quot; series books apply for South Jersey?

Much of your teaching philosophy struck a chord with me. I would like to be a middle school media specialist. I am concerned about making a media center that is focused on test knowledge, not a desire to read and learn. I have very mixed feelings about adding programs, such as AR Reading, to an already overbalanced test-result curriculum. I also want to connect with students. I am 40 years old so that is not always easy. I get help from my teenage daughters and I do have a Facebook account so I'm not too far off.

Good luck with this course and your career!













==Nice Page==

Beautiful work on your page.  I can't wait to show this off in class!  Hope others will follow your excellent example.  Have a great day!

== About UNISDR Regional Office for Asia &amp; Pacific ==
With over 50% of the total world disasters, the Asia and Pacific Islands region represents the widest and most disaster prone continent in the world, beyond Africa, with a regular and increased frequency of typhoons, tsunamis, floods, droughts, fires and other natural hazards. Despite the wealth of expertise, knowledge and know-how in disaster risk reduction, the increasing population growth, widespread poverty, environmental degradation, rising pollution and wild human settlements keep increasing the vulnerabilities of most communities in Asia and the Pacific Islands, thereby creating a favorable terrain to allow the above natural hazards to transform invariably into devastating disasters wiping out all human lives and economic lifelines on their way, and setting back years of continued development efforts.

In December 2004, the tragic tsunami in the Indian Ocean has heightened the level of awareness of the communities in Asia and the Pacific about the importance of integrating disaster risk reduction into national development planning and reminded them of the need to work together in a coordinated manner to respond to the threat of disasters.

In that spirit, as a direct follow-up to the World Conference on Disaster Reduction (January 2005, Kobe, Japan) and at the request of the 168 UN Member States grouped together on the occasion, the UN/ISDR established a regional presence to cover the whole Asia and Pacific Islands region. The UN/ISDR regional Unit for Asia and the Pacific was set up in June 2005 in Bangkok, Thailand, hosted by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP).

== Our Mandate ==
The core mandate of the UN/ISDR Asia &amp; Pacific includes awareness-raising activities in disaster risk reduction, including the promotion of the World Disaster Reduction Campaign and the annual UN Sasakawa Award for Disaster Reduction, advocacy through policy formulation, the dissemination of guidelines to assist in the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), promote the establishment of national platforms for disaster risk reduction, enhance networking and partnership-building to contribute to an effective culture of safety and protection of all communities in the Asia and Pacific Islands region.

Three specific areas of focus have been identified to guide the work of the UN/ISDR Asia and the Pacific. They include:

(i) The promotion of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) throughout the whole Asia and Pacific Islands region and the forging of partnerships at the regional level to facilitate its implementation, with the effective operational support and expertise of members of the ISDR Asian Partnership on Disaster Reduction (IAP) and other relevant players.

(ii) The follow-up and strengthening of the projects carried out under the United Nations Flash Appeal for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Early Warning System (IOTWS), including an increased cooperation and coordination with relevant technical partners and the donor community. (iii) The development of an effective information management system with comprehensive databases, the maintenance of a regional website, the production of a bi-annual publication “Disaster Reduction in Asia and the Pacific - ISDR Informs”, the dissemination of regional highlights promoting regional partners’ initiatives and relevant events among other.

The UN/ISDR Asia and Pacific Islands works through a growing network of national platforms to mobilize governmental actions in disaster risk reduction as well as directly with the governments in the region, as mandated though the HFA, to assist them in identifying their priorities and in formulating their national action plan on disaster risk reduction towards its integration in national development plans. It also makes an effective use of regional partners’ networks at the national level, in particular the UN Country Team members, to facilitate the effective implementation of DRR strategies.

== Introduction ==
[[Image:IndKnow.gif‎|thumb|right|Cover]]
&quot;Even before we came up with high technology based early warning systems, 
or standard operating procedures for response, numerous local communities 
worldwide have prepared, operated, acted, and responded to natural 
disasters using indigenous methods passed on from one generation to the 
next.&quot;

The publication &quot;Indigenous Knowledge for Disaster Risk Reduction: Good 
Practices and Lessons Learned from experiences in the Asia-pacific 
Region&quot;, produced by United Nation International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and Kyoto University
with the assistance of the European Union, aims to build 
awareness for indigenous knowledge as an effective tool for reducing risk 
from natural disasters. By improving the understanding of indigenous 
knowledge and providing concrete examples of how it can be successfully 
used, this publication can help all practitioners and policy makers to 
consider the knowledge hold by local communities and act to integrate this 
wealth of knowledge into future disaster-related work. &quot;

== Gaming keyboards ==

Some of the high-tech gaming keyboards, such as mine, have the function keys (Ins, Del, End, Home, etc.) on the numpad insted of alternative direction keys.

== Needs clarification ==

There are sixteen keys named on the pseudo-numpad, and seventeen keys on a real numpad.  The keys on the pseudo-numpad have a different layout than the real numpad.  Could a chart be made to clarify the mapping between the two? - Asterai

OK, I made one that matches my own keyboard - and then fixed it when I realized it was wrong. *Facepalm.*  If this layout is not common, please put up a note saying so.  - Asterai</text>

== Abstract ==

Karez is a traditional irrigation water system which is able to make use of underground
water efficiently. The Karez system has a long history in the Xinjiang area of China. As
a comprehensive system, Karez is composed of four primary components: vertical wells,
underground canals, a surface canal and small reservoirs. Because of the Karez system, Turpan,
a basin located in the arid area of Northwestern China, is well-known for its wide variety of
agricultural products. In the Turpan area of Xinjiang, Karez is still being used to supply water
resources for irrigation and domestic uses. At present, modern technology has been integrated
into the traditional Karez system to further reinforce the successful traditional practice.

== Background ==

The Turpan depression, with a height of 32.8m, is
located in the Turpan basin which is the second lowest
basin in the world. It is surrounded by several high
mountainous areas (3500~5000m) which are covered
with glacier or permanent snow. The minimum
height of Aiding Lake, at the south of the basin, is
around -155m, which represents the lowest lake in
China. Underground water is abundant in the shallow
underground water-bearing layer. The terrain of the
mountains around Turpan basin is mainly formed
by hercynian movement at the end of the Paleozoic
period. It is hard and fractured and therefore fissured
water is easily formed. The exposed rocks of Flaming
Mountains mainly consist of sandy conglomerate and
mud stones of Jurassic, cretaceous as well as Tertiary.
Therefore, the geological condition of Turpan district
is fit to construct an underground canal with little
reinforcement for amassing sufficient water resources.
The Turpan area is famous for its wide variety of fruits
such as grapes, watermelons, and Hami muskmelons.


== Story/Event ==

Turpan is very dry in all seasons and very hot during
spring, summer and autumn. The highest temperature
recorded is 47.7°C in summer. High temperature and
strong solar radiation result in high annual evaporation
amounting to 2800~3000 mm.1 Turpan is in an inner
land with total annual precipitation of only around
16~17 mm. Because of strong evaporation or the
evapotranspiration process, precipitation (rain or snow)
falling on the slope of the mountain would evaporate or
seep underneath sand and soil before it can converge
into a stream and reach the flat agricultural area along
the foot of the mountain. Surface water is scarce in most
areas. Under such tough circumstances, few plants or
animals survive.



== Indigenous Knowledge ==

Karez is a traditional irrigation water system with a
long history in Xinjiang area of China which makes use
of underground water efficiently. Where farmland is
located in the mountainous area, it is built on an alluvial
fan or plain. Most existing Karez systems were mainly
constructed between the 17th and 20th century. The
currently functioning Karez systems are distributed
in the dry areas of the southern slope of Mountain
Tianshan in eastern Xinjiang, in the Hami district
as well as the Turpan, Shanshan and Toksun districts
of Turpan Basin. In the Turpan district, 1,016 Karez
systems still exist of which 686 are operational. The total
length is about 3,000 kilometers. The average depth of
the underground canal is 20 meters whilst the utmost
depth is 90 meters. The total outflow of the karez
systems in Turpan Basin is about 10 cubic meters per
second accounting for about 20% of the total diversion
water of the basin.2 At present, modern facilities such as
electromechanical wells are integrated into the system.
The structure of a complete Karez system can be
complex but its basic structure is essentially composed
of four main components: vertical wells, underground
canals, surface canal, and small reservoirs (Figure 1).

== Vertical Well ==

The length of the underground canal varies from
around 3 km to 30 km. It is almost impossible to dig
such a long underground canal without digging a
vertical well, especially in the past agricultural period
when no modern equipment was available. Hence, the
vertical well is primarily used to assist in digging the
underground canals. When the wells are dug, sand and
soil are excavated with the help of animals.
The major functions of vertical wells are for ventilation,
proper orientation of the canal during construction and
examination and repair of canals after construction.
The distance between vertical wells is generally around
60~100 meters in the upper reaches, 30~60 meters
in the middle, and 10~30 meters in the lower reaches.
The depth of wells is approximately 40~70 meters,
100 meters in the upper reaches, 30~40 meters in the
middle, and 3~15 meters in the lower reaches. Vertical
wells are utilized not only to aid in digging underground
canals, but also to take out water from these canals after
the whole Karez system is completed. An aerial image of
vertical wells is presented in Figure 2.

== Underground and Surface Canals ==

Of the two types of canals, the majority of them are
underground. The canals under the surface are generally
part of a network which enables underground water to
accumulate (as illustrated in Figure 3a). Usually the
deep soil around the underground canal is very strong
and does not collapse easily. However, when the canal
is close to the surface, the soil is loose. To prevent
the underground canal from collapsing, it is usually
reinforced with wooden pillars. At the bottom of the
well, both sides are excavated for the underground canal.
When the underground canal reaches the farmland, it
becomes a surface canal and is linked to a small reservoir
or directly connected to a system of water channels for
irrigation (Figure 3b). Usually
the surface canal is short to limit
evaporation.

== Small Reservoir ==

Water resources are collected
in small reservoirs which can
be adjusted for water level and
temperature. Constructing
reservoirs increase the water level
so that a larger area of farmland
is irrigated. Moreover, the water
stored in reservoirs receives
sunlight which increases their
temperature. The warmer water
is more appropriate for irrigation,
since the low temperature of water
due to snow melting or because
of its underground source may do
severe harm to crops.
A variety of simple tools are
employed for building Karez
systems. These include an
excavating hoe, a planning hammer,
a basket, a winch and an oil lamp
(as displayed in Figure 4). The
excavating hoe and planning
hammer are used for digging
passages underground. The basket
and winch are used for carrying soil
and sand. Iron oil lamps with an
arrow for orientation are used for
digging underground canals. The
lamp can also be conveniently fixed
on canal walls. Currently in Hami
city of China, a sunlight reflecting
mirror is also used for orientation.
In constructing the different
components of the Karez system,
it is vital to ensure that along the
underground canal, water resources
are sufficient. A crucial first step is
to find water sources in the upper
reaches and the depth of water
estimated in accordance with the
location of farmland. The location
for digging the well can then be
decided. Subsequently, wells and
canals can be built gradually from
the lower to the upper reaches
following the water source.


== Lessons Learned ==

The Karez system is a proven and effective indigenous drought reduction technology that is still in use. This
traditional knowledge has several advantages as follows:

1. Support by Earth’s Gravity. Since Karez takes advantage of topography to divert deep subsurface flow through
an underground canal to land surface for gravity irrigation, the cost for water-lifting equipment and its
maintenance are almost negligible.

2. Stable Outflow. The major water sources of the Karez system are melting snow and underground water. The
underground canal can minimize high evaporation in the windy Turpan district hence, the impact of climate
change is small. In addition, problems with sand blast can be avoided in the underground canal. All this
makes the Karez system able to provide stable water resources, though total water volume may not be very
large. As observed, there has been a very stable population for thousands of years in Karez areas, regardless of
environment changes.

3. High Water Quality. Melting water from snow enters the system and the soil provides a very good filter to
remove polluted materials. Unlike water channels on land, the underground canal minimizes water pollution
and at the same time is rich in minerals. The water quality is suitable for drinking and domestic use.

4. Construction with Simple Tools. Most Karez systems are built with simple tools and do not require complex
equipment.

Conversely, the Karez system has constraints. There is a spatial limitation on its construction and use. It is only
applicable in areas with stable underground water supply and hard soil. Some Karez systems were built around
Guanzhong Plain in Central China in the Han Dynasty which did not last because the underground canals
collapsed. Furthermore, the volume of water in the Karez system may change with the season although there is
little variation in the volume daily. In the summer, there are sufficient water resources if the water source is from
melting snow. In the spring, Karez water is limited, while in autumn and winter it is substantial. This is sometimes
in discord with water demand for agriculture.

There is thus a need to strengthen the traditional Karez system with modern technology. Its value as an efficient
indigenous drought reduction technology should not be ignored. Instead, this traditional knowledge should be
improved and reinforced with modern technology. Its widespread use promoted in the face of severe drought
disaster in the future.

There are many possible meanings that one might wish to attach to the „i-“ in i-Stuff. here are a few possibilities:
* „i-“ for Internet
* „i-“ for Interactive
* „i-“ for Individual
* „i-“ for Interesting
* and possibly many more

We are going to focus on „i-“ for Identity. That is why we have put this section here under „Identity and Privacy“.
In other words we want to look at how iStuff relates directly to the identity of the individual having it and using it.
To get handle on this idea we will use 3 well-known practical examples of iStuff: the iPhone, iPod, and iBook.
Let us begin by taking a look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone iPhone].

==iPhone==
„The Apple iPhone is an internet connected multimedia smartphone with a flush multi-touch screen and a minimal hardware interface. Lacking a physical keyboard, a virtual keyboard is rendered on the touch screen. The iPhone's functions include those of a camera phone and portable media player (equivalent to the iPod) in addition to text messaging and visual voicemail. It also offers Internet services including e-mail, web browsing, and local Wi-Fi connectivity.“&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone iPhone]&lt;/ref&gt;

==iPod==


„iPod is a popular brand of portable media players designed and marketed by Apple Inc. and launched on 23 October 2001. As of 2008, the current product line-up includes the hard drive-based iPod Classic, the touchscreen iPod Touch, the video-capable iPod Nano, the screenless iPod Shuffle and the iPhone.“&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod iPod]&lt;/ref&gt;

==iBook==

„The iBook is a line of laptop computer that was developed and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. between 1999 and 2006. It was targeted at the consumer and education markets, with fewer features and lower prices than the PowerBook.“&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook iBook]&lt;/ref&gt;

==iStuff==

Let us begin to see what is out there:

==1. Karez Techonology for Drought Disaster Reduction in China‎==

Hi there.  Just noticed you had created the page [[1. Karez Techonology for Drought Disaster Reduction in China‎]] when I think you meant to create it at [[Indigenous Knowledge for Disaster Risk Reduction/1. Karez Techonology for Drought Disaster Reduction in China‎]].  I have moved that page for you.  Please see our naming policy (link above) or leave a question on my talk page if you have any further questions.  Thanks. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 11:30, 1 September 2008 (UTC)

==Reply to Questions==

&lt;i&gt;&quot;The book that I am trying to upload has a lot of images. I am not able to upload them. can you tell me how to do it. Please refer to http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Indigenous_Knowledge_for_Disaster_Risk_Reduction#Introduction&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
:See [[Special:Upload]] should tell you everything you need to know.  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll see what I can to do help, though I am no expert on uploading images. 
''
''Dear Ad,

I tried opening this page, but I keep on getting an Error Message.  &quot;Permission error
From Wikibooks, the open-content textbooks collection. The action you have requested is limited to users in one of the groups: Autoconfirmed users, Administrators. &quot;

Can you tell me where I am going wrong?''''

:Hello Abhilash.  Sorry I should have remebered.  You can't upload images until your account is 4 days old, however you can upload images at commons which can then be referenced from here.  More details can be found [[Using_Wikibooks/Introduction/Setting_Up_A_User_Account#Uploading_Images | here]] --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 08:53, 2 September 2008 (UTC)
'''
Question: I guess its more than 4 days now, can i have the image upload or file upload facility?'''
:Yes [[Special:Upload]] should work for you now.  Let me know if it still doesn't. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 07:54, 5 September 2008 (UTC)

&lt;i&gt;&quot;How do i get this book, searchable in Wikipedia?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
:I'm afraid that wikipedia and wikibooks are separate projects and as such have separate search engines.  So the short answer is that you can't.  What you can do is add a wikibooks tag on a related article at wikipedia directing users here if they want more in depth information on a subject. --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 12:47, 1 September 2008 (UTC)

==Licensing==

Just one more thing.  It looks like the book you are uploading has already been written and published elsewhere.  Do you have permission to release it here under the [[wikibooks:copyright | GNU Free Documentation Licence]]? --[[User:AdRiley|AdRiley]] ([[User talk:AdRiley|talk]]) 12:53, 1 September 2008 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;Abhilash&lt;/big&gt;

This has been produced by us I mean by United Nations ISDR with Kyoto University, in order to make the same accessible to more and more professional we thought of using the Wiki.
:Would you please send an email to {{email|permissions-en|wikimedia.org}} so our [[m:OTRS|OTRS]] team can verify and archive this? The email should be sent from an account affiliated with Kyoto University. Thanks for your assistance. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:12, 4 September 2008 (UTC)

Answer: What is OTRS team and what do you mean by Archiving, The email can come from United Nations for Kyoto Univ it would take a long time, moreover this project is managed by United Nations, International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. Let me know if this is agreeable.</text>

Hello fellow authors of ECI 301!! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Linda. I reside in Carroll County, VA. I love it here in the mountains! I have a wonderful husband and two beautiful girls. Also, we have one dog named Maximus, along with two cats, Callie and Pepper. 

I received an associate degree of Arts and Sciences, with a major in education, from Wytheville Community College in the Spring of 2008. I am attending ODU as a teletechnet student from the WCC site, majoring in IDS, PreK-6. I'm very nervous about moving on to a new school, well university, but at the same time I am very excited!!

Outside of school, my interests include spending time with my family and friends, attending and being involved in church activities, and exercising. Too, I really like to shop for shoes, pocketbooks, and sunglasses!!

==Philosophy on Teaching==

What is my philosophy on teaching? Actually, I have never given much thought to this question. I do know however that when it comes to children, I have a big heart. And unfortunately in today's society, too many are neglected. And some children never have a chance at life because of the adults in their lives. This is where teachers come in. They play an important role in the lives of their students. Teachers have the ability to intercede and make a difference in a child's life. I think that most children today need love, guidance, and someone to believe in them. This is the kind of teacher I someday hope to be!!</text>

== Author Respone ==

Hello! I think to be a good teacher you also need to have a good heart. I never really thought about my teaching philosphy either but I also hope that when i become a teacher, I will be a good one.    [[User:Arose011|Arose011]] ([[User talk:Arose011|talk]]) 19:50, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

I agree with the statement that teachers play an important role in the lives of their students. Other than their parents, a student spends 6 hours a day 5 days a week with their teachers. For students ranging from K-6 they spend most of the school day with a single teacher. Many times in my elementary school years have I seen a fellow student mistakenly call the teacher &quot;mom&quot;. With that much time spent its important for the teacher to guide them through their educational experience.[[User:Jferi002|Jferi002]] ([[User talk:Jferi002|talk]]) 18:27, 14 September 2008 (UTC)


It was very nice to read your introduction.  I am also taking class over teletechnet at in Glenns Va.  I also believe that teachers can make such an impact on children's lives.  Each child deserves at least the chance to make something out of thier lives.  By setting a good base for a child early, they have a better chance to have a better life when they become adults.  Very nice to meet you and can not wait to read your articles.  [[User:Rreev002|Rreev002]] ([[User talk:Rreev002|talk]]) 23:29, 14 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This will cover the period of time from around the 1400s to the 1600s prior to European expansion.

== Before European Expansion ==

=== West Africa ===

Many people lived in the West African Sahara region.  From here, many traveled north, and from there an important trade in gold and salt developed as they came in contact with those from other regions and lands.

Kinship bonds were very important to the people as an important cultural aspect of their lives.  These bonds generally extended past the immediate family members to the extended family.  Many in the region practiced polygamy for economic purposes, especially to pay off debts.  Europeans who later came to the region deemed this practice as barbaric and sinful, as yet another region to establish what they believed as European superiority.

Religion was an important part of the lives of people from this land.  Before the arrival of Islam, importance was stressed on a spiritual presence pervading nature.  The people of this region mainly practiced monotheistic beliefs, although many also practiced some form of ancestor respect or worship.  Artistic traditions were an important part of their beliefs.

Islam spread to the region by the 11th century by followers of the religion.  The grasslands settlers became Muslims, and followers enforced the Islamic Law.  Many of the West African kingdoms, which were primarily found in grassland regions, were bureaucratic empires, and often claimed a semi-godlike status to disguise the practice and spread of Islam.

=== Europe ===

By the mid to late 1400s Europe was beginning to reach the height of the European Renaissance.  After a century-long economic recession, many parts of Europe were becoming wealthier.  Excess money was available for Europeans that was not needed for basic necessities, which many patrons used to commission for painters and sculptors of the time.  However, many factors made the lives of people in Europe reconsider staying where they live, paving the way for territorial expansion.  These factors occurred throughout Europe, especially Western Europe; the country most affected was England, which faced much change and conflict during this time.

==== Economy ====

There were many concerns about economic ranks and social status, which was mainly determined by gender, wealth, inherited position, owned property, and political power.  At the top of the social hierarchy were the Kings and the members of their courts, followed by the masses of society.  There was a large socioeconomic gap between the few educated rich, who owned most of the property and wielded nearly all of the available power, and the many educated poor, who were mostly peasants, formed between 70% and 80% of the population, led miserable lives, and had almost no political power despite their larger numbers in society.  It was common for a king involved in a war or conflict to levy high taxes to help finance the war, and the poor were often the most economically affected by these taxes.  Tensions and hatred rose between the rich and the poor.  

An economic depression in the 1500s left many impoverished and homeless.

There was also a rapid increase in population.  In England, the population doubled from around 2.5 million in 1500 to about 5 million is 1620. More workers competed for fewer jobs, and unemployment and low wages were increasingly common.  The mobile unemployed, who often had to travel to find jobs, wanted to find an alternative place to live where they could support themselves and their families.  

There were strict property inheritance rules that determined who could inherit the family's fortune.  These rules generally required the recipients of family property to be male relatives, most often the eldest son of the deceased family members.  This left other members of the family, especially younger sons, to be forced to seek their fortune elsewhere, since they were ineligible for inheriting the family fortune.  The result of these rules was that many of the New World's first explorers were the younger sons of wealthier families in Europe.

Joint-stock companies, the ancestors to the modern corporation, were formed in an attempt to help the economy and make more money for investors as well as the country.  The Virginia Company was one of them, and later helped to finance one of the first English colonies in America, the colony of Jamestown.

==== Religion ====

Religious tensions soared during this time, as the Catholic Church faced the separation of Christianity into many groups that broke away from the Church, the most significant of which occurring in the Early Modern Period.  In the early 1500s, King Henry VIII of England had wanted to seek an annulment of marriage with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon (also known as Catalina of Aragon) because of her apparent inability to produce his desired male heir.  When the Catholic Church refused to grant the couple an annulment, the former devout Catholic Henry VIII decided to break away from the Church and form the Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church.  The leader of the newfound Church of England granted King Henry the annulment he had wanted, marking the formal separation of and the start of increased tensions between the Anglican and Catholic Churches.  After the death of Henry VIII, reign was passed on to his sickly son Edward VI, who ruled for only a short period of time.  After Edward VI died, rule was passed on to his eldest daughter Mary, who restored Catholicism to the country.  Mary was often known as &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; for her ruthless persecution of Protestants residing in England.  After Mary's death, Queen Elizabeth I (known as the &quot;Virgin Queen&quot;) brought back Protestantism.  Religious tensions between Catholics and Protestants continued to grow.

In addition to the separation of the Anglican Church, the Catholic Church had to deal with more separation.  In 1517, Martin Luther became unhappy with what he perceived as abuse of the Catholic Church.  He disliked the then-common practice of the sale of indulgences, which were supposed to relieve the buyers of punishment or penance for sin, and thus give the buyer access to heaven and eternal life after death.  He also disliked the discouragement of the Church in providing direct access to the Bible and other Christian scriptures, as well as the concept that leaders of the Church served as a mediator between God and the people.  In 1517, he posted the ''Ninety-Five Theses on the Power of Indulgences'', which stated his opinions about Christianity and condemned the Church practices he disagreed with, on the doors of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany.  While he was later excommunicated from the Catholic Church for these beliefs, many people liked his ideas of a more personal relationship with God, and that only God Himself (not the Church or any other mediator) could forgive the people for their sins directly.  Luther was especially favored by the economic poor and socially disadvantaged, many of whom could not afford to pay for indulgences but wanted to be absolved from sin.  Luther's teachings provided the basic foundation for the Lutheran, Reformed, and Anabaptist traditions within the Protestant Church, all of which formally separated from the Catholic Church.

John Calvin was especially moved by Luther's teachings, elaborating on his point of view of the theses and founding Calvinism, a religious tradition within the Protestant Church.  Calvinism helped form the roots of Scottish Presbyterianism, English Puritanism, the beliefs of the French Huguenots, and the traditions adopted by the Dutch Reformed Church.  Calvinism taught that God was all-powerful, all-good, and all-knowing, and that humans were conversely weak and wicked because of the Original Sin of the Bible.  God, according to Calvin, knew from the moment of creation who was destined for heaven (known as ''visible saints'' or the ''elect'') and who was destined for hell, and could not save those destined for eternal damnation from their ''predestination'', or fate.  Even the elect were largely unsure of whether they were indeed among those who were guaranteed salvation, and sought in themselves signs of ''conversion'' and ''sainthood''.

The Puritan minority, who were largely part of the economically disadvantaged called for what they saw as a needed purification of the Anglican Church from all Catholic traditions and rituals.  They primarily adopted Calvinism as their creed, believing that only visible saints should be admitted to the church membership, opposing the Anglican Church creed that all citizens of England should be admitted.  Many were unhappy with the slow movement of the Protestant Reformation, and were eager to de-Catholicize the Church of England.  They were divided into the Separatists, who wanted to break away from the Anglican Church, and the Non-Separatists, who wanted to reform the Anglican Church from within.  Many Separatists left for Calvinist Holland.  Both Separatists and Non-Separatists feared religious persecution.  Queen Elizabeth I distrusted most of them, but kept their loyalty as a Protestant.  King James I firmly opposed them, issuing a &quot;no bishop, no king&quot; doctrine to oppose the belief that all who members of the church were visible saints.

The Quakers were a minority denomination of Protestant Christianity, named mainly for their unusual traditions practiced during times of worship.  They were generally peace-loving people who disliked war and conflict.  They were against parts of Puritan doctrine.  They disliked what they considered ungodly practices such as performing plays, playing dice, playing cards, exhibiting extreme hilarity, or certain forms of dancing.  They were largely persecuted by others for their beliefs and sought religious freedom.

==== International Relations ====

During this time, nearly every country in Western Europe was fighting for power.  All hoped to prove themselves worthy of the title of most powerful country in the world.  These rivalries began to grow powerful as religion and the economy became more relevant.  Holland (also known as the Netherlands) sought, and later received, independence from Spain, and the Dutch wanted to gain a strong position in this world.  Catholic Spain and France became increasingly hostile with largely Protestant England.

When the English fleet defeated the Spanish Armada, the strength of the dreams and fighting spirit Spain once had was largely weakened, helping England achieve naval dominance over the North Atlantic region.

== European Exploration ==

=== Prior Exploration ===

The Vikings had previously visited parts of the Americas. Their American colony was placed in modern day Newfoundland and called Vinland. Settlement in Vinland was small and temporary, in part due to poor relations with indigenous peoples.

=== Initial Exploration ===

Christopher Columbus had sought an alternative route to India, and received permission from Spain to search for one.  He sailed across the Atlantic Ocean with three ships, called the ''Nina'' (Little Girl), the ''Pinta'' (Spot), and the ''Santa Maria'' (Saint Mary).  In 1492, he reached the Americas in the Caribbean region, although he believed he was in India.  After later realizing that he had indeed discovered a new land previously unknown to the rest of the world, he had begun the start of a series of explorations that would later pave the way for European colonization.

=== Circumnavigation ===

In 1580, Sir Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe, plundering and returning with his ship loaded with Spanish booty, and making a profit of about 4,600%.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ABOUT ME'''

[[Image:User Clins002.jpg]]


My name is Chris Linscott.  I love history and always have.  Last spring I was content with just going for a straight history degree, but the more I thought about it, the more the prospect of teaching history appealed to me.  In particular, I enjoy United States History.  It is my firm belief that the Civil War is in many ways the most influential period in the history of this country.  I hope to teach High School History, though ideally, I hope to end up at a University teaching a class that is dedicated to the Civil War and Reconstruction.
I am attending classes full time; at the same time I work full time at William E. Wood Realty and Associates.  I must apologize to every one out there, for I am indirectly responsible for the junk mail the company sends out.  to be more precise, I work in the print shop, where we print both legal forms and, well, junk mail, that that agents send use and send out.  I've been there for just over 5 years now. 

'''Teaching Philosophy'''

As I have only recently decided to do this, I'm sure this will change.  Right now, I believe that it is the teacher's primary mission to inform.  I do not think that the teacher's goal is to directly mold the thoughts of the student; if it were then it would be no different than brainwashing.  If a teacher must insert his or her opinion into the subject matter, I believe that both sides should be represented equally, or at least make it known before hand of personal bias.  I was a special needs student all the way up till i graduated high school, so I feel that I have a special understanding of students in similar situations.  Because I can relate, I feel that I can apply myself in reaching out and assisting students with special needs.</text>

For one who has so recently decided to become a teacher, you have a very well-founded philosophy of education.  Your thoughts about not wanting to brainwash children to your opinions show that your heart is in the right place, and your relationship with the students will be excellent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Basics ==
I love animals and have several pets, the one closest to my heart is my one-eyed guinea pig Petey &quot;The One-Eyed Pirate&quot;; he's very affectionate and loves attention. I've been working at Petsmart for over a year and I absolutely love it, if you have an animals question, i probably have an answer. In my spare time I like to go down to Northside Park with my best friend and catch frogs, we have plenty of funny stories from our trips out there. 

== My Philosophy of Education ==
I believe teachers should reach out to students and capture their attention. A teacher should challenge their students about class material but also about current events. Too often students are ignorant to what is going on around them, teachers should disseminate current events about politics and world affairs. This increase of circulation of knowledge would help to better inform students and help to produce better informed citizens and voters. A chinese proverb states &quot;Tell me and I forget. Show me and I remember. Involve me and I understand.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''ABOUT ME'''

My name is Ariel Elmore.  I live in southern Virginia with my son.  He's a little over a year old so he's into EVERYTHING.  When I'm not chasing him around the house, I am working as a paraprofessional in my local school district.  I have my Bachelor's of Science in Psychology.  I am currently attending ODU to convert my degree into a teaching degree.  

'''TEACHING PHILOSOPHY'''

I firmly believe that it takes a village to raise a child.  Therefore the village needs to be involved in the education of the child.  What the teacher begins in the classroom must be reinforced out of it.  Parents and the community need to play an active role in our school systems.  If the child has homework then so does the child's family.  It is not just the responsiblity of the teacher to educate the child but the family's as well.  Teachers and parents need to work together to make sure that children are getting the best education possible.  As do the schools and local communities.  These children are our future.  They need everyone's support to grow up to be successful.
A new mother as well, mine is 19 months, I couldn't agree more with the village approach.  It takes the cooperation of the entire community to raise children well.  Communities need to be safe and stimulating, as well as the schools.  Many parents don't take enough of an active role in educating their children.  Laziness has led them to rely solely on the schools for educating.  No one wants to be called out on this issue but it is so true.[[User:Egarr008|Egarr008]] ([[User talk:Egarr008|talk]]) 22:31, 13 September 2008 (UTC)
Hello Ariel,

I am Robin Evans, After reading your intro I noticed that we have something in common and that is a 1 year old who stays into everything.  My daughter is 14 months and she keeps me very buzy!!!!My oldest is 9 and he beleives that he has been every where and done everything twice.  I think that you are probly going thru the same thing as me, and that is balancing kids and school.  You know just I like I do that it is hard but so what we can do it.  It was good talking with you.  I wish you all the luck with your classes and anything else that you try to accomplish.[[User:Revan027|Revan027]] ([[User talk:Revan027|talk]]) 21:11, 14 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

Hi Jennifer! I enjoyed your intro. And I agree with your education philosophy, it does take more than a degree to be a good teacher. I believe you also have to have the heart for it!!

Hey Jennifer, another Jennifer here :) I just wanted to say that I agree with what you said about dedication. Teaching takes a special person, and within that special person is dedication. Great job, and good luck this semester &amp; with the rest of your journey :)
[[User:Jennlynn88|Jennlynn88]] ([[User talk:Jennlynn88|talk]]) 18:19, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

Hey J, I agree with you that you do have to have your whole heart and soul into teaching. Some teachers who have been in the system for a while don't want to change and are too tired to continue to put their whole heart and soul into it...and they should retire. :) Best of luck to you.

Hi Shannon! I enjoyed reading your introduction. It sounds like you've had an exciting life! Out of the states you've visited, which one did you enjoy the most? VA, perhaps!! I've always lived here and I'm sad to say that I haven't done a lot of traveling, just for vacation. Maybe someday I'll be able to!! Look forward to having ECI 301 with you!

-Thank you for your message. Infact, of all the places I have lived, I do like Virginia the best. There are many beautiful places in this country, but nothing has felt as much like home as Virginia.

I really enjoyed your teaching philosophy.  I agree that children, in fact EVERYONE, desires to know and learn.  It's just so overwhelming when you don't know how much information is out there.  How do you feel about technology in the library?  It sometimes seems like it scares some book-lovers.  Best of luck on your adventures!

Hi Shannon! You have quite the introduction...and quite a story! Every child does deserve to learn...and I can't wait to be a part of that process. It is definitely different to hear of someone wanting to be a librarian. (It will definitely take patience.) I know I appreciate librarians very much!!! Best wishes with this course and your future! -Megan

Hey Shannon. I find your philosophy on teaching great. I do agree with you that we need to encourage people to find their passion and to work with that. However, libraries is an interesting vocation. I do believe that books give the reader something very different than what a web page can offer. However, how can a library compete with the internet in sheer content and interactivity? I love a good library but the internet provides easy access and speed. [[User:Rhatchel|Rhatchel]] ([[User talk:Rhatchel|talk]]) 19:33, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

Hey.  I completely agree with your philosophy on teaching.  I feel I was once, and still am in some ways, one of those people who just don't know how to get where they want to go.  And I know what you mean about people misunderstanding New Jersey.  I was born there and lived there most of my life, so I know what you mean.  [[User:BCollier|BCollier]] ([[User talk:BCollier|talk]]) 01:21, 15 September 2008 (UTC)


Your article is looking great!  Can't wait to see how your peers like it.  I think it's excellent--especially the formatting.

Hey! i love animals. i have two cats right now. But i am more of a dog person! i used to have a guiena pig named sunflower! i love guinea pigs! i believe that students are often ignorant to the world around them. I think it is a good idea to keep them updated on the activites of the world! [[User:Kdesi001|Kdesi001]] ([[User talk:Kdesi001|talk]]) 16:54, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

Hey hows it going! I went to a high school were most of the students were also ignorant. I appreciate teachers that really can catch the attention of his/her students. A good teacher is the one thing that gets a student into school.    [[User:Arose011|Arose011]] ([[User talk:Arose011|talk]]) 19:45, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

I didn't mean to say that the students from the school i came from were ignorant, just that they had no idea of current events that could soon inmpact their lives, like the comming up election. Teacher didn't often include world/current events in the information they provided to their students. I didn't feel like the teachers were completely preparing their students like they could have. [[User:Hpoer001|Hpoer001]] ([[User talk:Hpoer001|talk]]) 02:00, 15 September 2008 (UTC)

Yes, Garvin was the man!!  I had him for art and photography for a few years.  I love that guy.  He was one of my top favorites, along with Jenkins, Dyer, Jones (I think she left in '04 before my senior year), and Hathaway.  I know people think I'm crazy but she really did have a passion for math and life like no other teacher there.  Did the teachers there also inspire you to go into education?  It's great to meet another Norview alumn!  Best wishes with your future and in class! [[User:Dbrod001|Dbrod001]] ([[User talk:Dbrod001|talk]]) 03:38, 15 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello future shapers of the next generation!!

==About Me==

Hello my name is Amy and I am 26 years old. I currently live in Virginia Beach with my boyfriend Zeib and our dog Maddox. I am an Assistant Director at a Huntington Learning Center where I have learned many different things from my teachers. It was my teachers at HLC that convinced me that I would be a great elementary teacher. So after some minor threats from my employees I looked into ODU to get my teaching license. This is my first education class and already I am realizing that I already have some knowledge base.

==Education==

I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Early Childhood Psychology from Christopher Newport University. While attending CNU I was actively involved in the Greek system as a member of the Phi Mu Fraternity. I am still very active as an Alumna member now. I enjoy school and have always said if I could get paid to be a student for the rest of my life I totally would! I look forward to getting into the classroom and continuing my own education with a Master's. One step at a time though...

==Teaching Philosophy==

My teaching philosophy is simple and positive. Every child can learn if people dedicate time for them and are the postive light in their lives. Unfortunately, since I work at Huntington Learning Center I do see a lot of children who have been left behind in their classrooms and their parents have given up hope. I provide an encouraging word, positive reinforcement and some 1 on 1 time to these children and slowly but surely they move on up their percentile ranks! So, in the classroom I believe teachers should be the positive force in their students lives. Those people who are the ones encouraging their students to try new things, think differently, and work independently. By building confidence in our students I believe they are more likely to try new things, and discover new things all along the way.
I love your philosophy.  Simple but classic.  Many times parents and schools give up on children instead of creating new ideas to reach them.  I like your realistic point of view.[[User:Egarr008|Egarr008]] ([[User talk:Egarr008|talk]]) 22:26, 13 September 2008 (UTC)


Hello Amy!!! I am glad to read that you enjoy school and I believe that the love of school and education are characteristics of a great teacher. Your teaching philosophy really hit the mark especially when you said the terms &quot;dedication and positive light.&quot; I believe you will make a great teacher and that the students who are in your class will truly be motivated to learn. Good luck in your future.[[User:Tbrim001|Tbrim001]] ([[User talk:Tbrim001|talk]]) 23:15, 14 September 2008 (UTC)</text>

== Use, Limitations, Parameters, and Options ==


=== Use ===
----
Makes a light grey box for listing code blocks.   The main function lies in the POEM tags, and this template simply make a DIV box as a container for the code block.   The default font is ''Fixedsys'' since it emphasises punctuation well.   The box has options to change its appearance.   Call it as follows. 
{{block|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{codeblock|Heading Here|&lt;poem&gt;&amp;lt;nowiki&gt;Code Block Here&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE THE USE OF NOWIKI AND POEM TAG PAIRS.}}
It looks like this:
{{codeblock|align=center|Wikitext Code for a Colored Table|&lt;poem&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{|  style=&quot;background:lightyellow; color:red; border-top:1px solid gray; border-right:1px solid black; border-bottom:1px solid black; border-left:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5px align=left width=70%  
  |+ Top Caption Goes Here
|-
  ! style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;|Heading 1
  ! style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;|Heading 2
  ! style=&quot;background:brown;color:white;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;|Heading 3
|-
  | width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|A
  | width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|B
  | width=33% style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|C
|-
  | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|D
  | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|E
  | style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid gray&quot;|F
|-
  | style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;|G
  | style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;|H
  | style=&quot;border-bottom:1.5px solid black&quot;|I
|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}
Notice in particular that the long code lines have been wrapped while the other spacings have been preserved.

=== Limitations ===
----
The '''&amp;lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags must immediately surround the code block and '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tags must be added outside of these.


=== Parameters ===
----
There are two parameters which may be called by either their numbers or their label names.

;1:   Parameter '''heading''':   Enter text for the top title for the code.
;2:   Parameter '''content''':   Enter the code block and surround it in &amp;lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.


=== Options ===
----
;width:      width of the box, default auto.
;align:      horizontal position of the box, default left.
;margin:     margins of the box, default 0 0 0 0, in sequence top, right, bottom, and left.
;background: the background color of the box, default rgb(230,230,230), a light grey.
;color:      text color, default rgb(55,55,55), a dark grey.
;ff:         font family, default fixedsys, since it has good clarity.
;border:     the perimeter border of the box, default 1px solid rgb(220,220,220), shade of grey.
;padding:    text padding, default 10px 15px 15px 15px in sequence top, right, bottom, left.

Megan- I really like how are so interested in the aspect of communication and teaching. My undergraduate degree is in interpersonal communication so I also recognize the importance of communication, verbal and non-verbal. Since people learn in so many different ways, it is possible that what is best for some students may not work for others.  I also think it is important that we teach good communication to the children so that they are better able to relate to the students in their class.  It is very easy to misunderstand, but learning and using good communication can facilitate a better environment.

Megan- It is truely nice to meet someone from around here. But I truely believe you have a wonderful aspect of communication I workn in a daycare and you can sometime see where the teachers (because Im an assistant) they don't have the patience to even want to communicate and interact with their students. I do believe in communicaion with the students and definitely with their parents because in the long run they are the ones that need to be behind us and supporting and especially trusting us with their children. I agree in saying best of luck with everything.
- P-akka


This is a very important aspect I didn't even think about. For teachers its very important because they must do the most communicating in terms of students, parents, teacher aides, co-workers, and principles. Communication is one of the most important aspects not only in teaching but in life; verbal or non-verbal communication is KEY!

Data is...

Why do some argue is most important thing:


Static structure of system
- like a map

Advantages of database approach
Program-data independence
Minimal data redundancy
Improved data consistency
Improved data sharing
Improved data quality
Reduced program maintenance

===Difference between data model and database===

Modelling process

Data modelling is DESIGN
Creative solutions needed
Data model is one solution to req’s

Data modelling is IMPORTANT
Need a blueprint to build a house

Data modelling is a discipline
Professional judgement required

Data modelling through the development process.
[[Image:Allthree_datamodelling_NoRed.jpg |400px]]


Entity relationship model:
Detailed graphical representation of 		entities and associations

Focus is purely data
Not what happens to it
Depicts the form of the data
Not the data values
Specific to the needs of the business


Person, place, object, event, concept
that is of interest to the organisation
single, unambiguous names
Student, book, product

Time 
Space
Fuzzy

Association between the instances of one or more entity types
name strongly 
make a sentence to describe the relationship
may have attributes – an associative entity







A book is borrowed by a patron
A patron may borrow a book

Conceptual Schema
A detailed, technology independent specification of the overall structure of a database
Physical Schema
Specifications for how data from a conceptual schema are stored in a computer’s secondary memory




Let's say we are working on a High School records system.  From our intial requirements determination we have a collection of material: class lists, individual transcripts, class results and so on.   The tasks in data modelling is to extract the underlying structure of the information.  This is the data model.

The core of the data model is the entity.  An entity is something about which the organisation holds information.  It can be an actual thing or something less tangible like a concept (or student grades).  Note that an “entity” here describes the generic level of the things: hence STUDENT, rather than Bob.   Bob, Jane and their friends are all instances of STUDENT. 

In our simple school we can easily identify three entities: STUDENT, TEACHER and COURSE.

[[File:School model 1.png]]


Each entity is described by attributes.  These are what we use to describe the instances of each entity.  There are strict rules about attributes, they need to be independent and not repeating information.   They also need to be atomic (can’t be broken down), and not be dependent on other values.

In the example below, StudentName is unsuitable as it can be broken down into first and surname; StudentAge isn’t necessary as it can be calculated (putting it in by hand is asking for trouble), and StudentGrades is not atomic - it contains multiple values - which will not work (we’ll come back to this one).

[[File:School model 2.jpg]]


We also need some way of uniquely identifying each instance, this becomes the Primary key for the entity.  This has to be not change be unique. We could use the name but, despite us all feeling special, our names aren’t.  We could combine the name with date of birth and make a concatenated key.  Unfortunately, dates are very difficult to deal with (what is the significance of the 12th of September?) and it doesn’t resolve our non-unique problem.  So we have to use a new value: a STUDENT_ID. 

We can get the same information from these attributes and the data is structured much more powerfully. 

[[File:School model 3.jpg]]


The student grades are not information just about the student, they are information about that student's interaction with courses. 

The courses a student is enrolled in is more difficult to solve, but the solution is the heart of the power of a data based (and hence database) approach to understanding the business and implementing a solution.


[[File:School model 4.jpg]]

In the example above Bob is taking only Geography (wise choice), so that is easy to deal with.  Jane, however is taking French, Geography and History.   If we try and store this information in an attribute called Courses it is very difficult to extract this information - while it would be easy to get a list of Jane’s courses, a list of who is taking Geography would be very hard to extract (and involve complicated string manipulation etc). 

The real strength of data modelling, is in the identification of relationships.  A relationship describes the association between entities.    We start just by drawing a line between the entities:

[[Image:School model 5.jpg‎ ]]


We can see that there are clear relationships between STUDENT and COURSE, and COURSE and TEACHER.   We can express these relationships on the picture.  Reading in the direction of the arrows, these associations can be expressed as sentences: “a STUDENT takes this COURSE”, “a COURSE is taught by a TEACHER”.  (we’ll come back to how many when we look at cardinality). 

[[Image:School model 6.jpg]]


The STUDENT - TEACHER association, however, is not so clear.  The relationship (at least the one we are considering here) is already expressed by the model. We can extract which teacher is teaching which students via the COURSE they are teaching and enrolled in.  We don’t need an explicit  STUDENT-TEACHER relationship. 

[[Image:School model 7.jpg]]

Even that this level of consideration, we a being forced to carefully think about the business we are dealing with.  We could have described a STUDENT-TEACHER-COURSE model.  Why have we chosen not to have the STUDENT-TEACHER relationship rather than not having STUDENT-COURSE?

We  also need to express the numbers of instances that might be involved in the relationship.    We do this with &quot;crowsfeet&quot;, with the crow's foot on the many end. 

[[Image:Crowsfeet.jpg]]


Here we have “many STUDENTS may take many COURSES”, or conversely “many COURSES may be taken by many STUDENTS”.   We express the “many” on our diagram with a “crows foot” (hanging on to the many end).  

Early in the development of conceptual model it is OK to have a relationship like this, but we need to do more to make it useful.  A double-ended crowsfoot like this is called a &quot;none-specific relationship&quot;, we know we have lots of students and lots of courses, but not who is taking what.

[[Image:School model 8.jpg‎]]

One solution to these unconnected lists, is to include attributes for each of the courses someone is taking (below).  Unfortunately this doesn’t work either.  What happens when someone enrols in more courses than you have previously thought of, where do the results actually go, and we still don’t have a way of finding out who is enrolled in Geography.

[[Image:School model 9.jpg]]


What we need is a new entity to represent this relationship.  This is called an associative entity.  


[[Image:School model 10.jpg]]

We might have identified it earlier as it is really quite strong in terms of ‘thingness’.   The relationship between STUDENT and COURSE also has several parameters in its own right: date, result, perhaps internal assessment grades and so on.  The fact that the relationship has attributes indicates that it is really an entity.   

[[Image:School model 11.jpg]]


Again, we come back to the value of this process in understanding the business.  Is it just one entity?  We can think of sveral possible names for the entity - are they the same thing. 

There are cases where multiple names indicate multiple associations - the Human resources manager authorises payment of salaries (one relationship), but is also on the payroll herself.  

This middle entity shows the association between STUDENT and COURSE, ENROLMENT.  
When we implement the model, the ENROLMENT entity (table) does not contain the student’s names, nor the courses - the computer can quite efficiently go and get them.   Instead we just use the primary keys from the other entities  - they become foreign keys.

There is though, a flaw in our model.  Jane Smith seems to be enrolled twice in History.  This is not a mistake (except for Jane) - she failed it the first time.  In order to allow this to happen we need to represent more information, the year of enrolment. 
Our model can generate the information required, it will be useful as the development progresses as we work to make it more tigtly defined.  

The primary focus in functional requirements is the process itself, by developing such a model, we are forced to think carefully about the business we are working with.

==Example models==

This model describes a job management system for an engineering firm. 

[[Image:Example_jobmanagement.jpg |400px]]

A different group made this model for the same system.

[[Image:Example_jobmanagement2.jpg |400px]]

A system for a library.   When developing this model, most people think of &quot;book&quot;, but a book means different things in different situations.  It is the physical book that is loaned, yet it is the &quot;title&quot; that people actually want to read (and that of a particular category such as large print). 
Note the two relationships between item and patron for loan and reserve. 

[[Image:Example_library.jpg |400px]]


This system describes an environmental planning system for agriculture.

Laptops, cell phones, iPods and other devices have put work, socialization and entertainment on the move. In essence, our work and personal lives are increasingly characterized by mobility and intertwined with the technologies that enable it. A lot has been written on this topic, much in academic circles as well as in industry and practitioner outlets. This book will serve to bring together the wide range of facts and thinking on this topic in a format that is open to ongoing improvement.

Having taught the introductory Information Systems course at McGill University's Centre for Continuing Education for several terms, I had seen many of our students submit excellent work for their short &quot;theory paper&quot; assignment. Meant to engage students in researching a current topic in the world of Information and Communication Technology, the student essays would often reveal much in the fast-changing IT world that I was not aware of, and invariably proved to be a learning experience for myself and my co-instructors (Leo Kerklaan and Charles Quesnel). I long felt it a shame that such good summaries by students of hot topics in the ICT domain should get only the limited circulation of graders and instructors. Wikibooks seemed like a great place for students to expose their work to a wider audience. 

For this first attempt at bringing our students' work out of the confines of the classroom, the topic of the Mobile Society seemed quite pertinent. The changes to our work and personal lives  seem to be all around us, and I hope, will be easily seen and written about by the students of our course (MGCR 331 Introduction to Information Systems). With this in mind, I developed the outline for this Wikibook. I look forward to your contributions, and hope to see a wide audience for this collaborative work.
